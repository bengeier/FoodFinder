{"text":"This owner is the worst person I'd ever had to deal with. I order my food as I'm waiting way longer then I should I ask for it Togo I waited 45 minutes while it wasn't busy at all. Got home to eat my food I spit it out and called the store back. They told me I'd be contacted within 30 minutes. I waited and called an hour later and talked with the owner expressing the quality of his food. Not asking for anything in return and he started by yelling at me. And cursing at me and expressing that if he gave out refunds to everyone that complained he'd go out of business keep in mind I didn't ask for anything and just kept going on yelling at me for no reason. Poor quality & overall never in your life go her for your on benefit."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good and service friendly and quick. I enjoyed the enchilada style Theresa's special--certainly kicks ass on fajitas from a chain restaurant. It tasted fresh-made; ingredients were all flavorful and it was neither over nor under cooked. The margarita was flavorful too--not watery or over-sweet as many chain restaurant margaritas are. My one reason for not rating it higher is that the menu did not include some of my favorite Mexican dishes such as mole, chili verde and tamales. Maybe that's because Sonoran style food doesn't include those, but that's my preference."}
{"text":"It was good, portions were big and I didnt finish everything. Chips and Salsa were were good too. My only complaint was it was cold and the fans were blasting down on us. We asked the waitress to turn it down and she said she didn't know how. omg really?!?!? It probably took about 20 mins to figure it out! Other than that my experience here was a good one."}
{"text":"Would never go back!  The food is bland and the restaurant is dirty, clearly it's poorly managed. There are so many other good Mexican restaurants, my suggestion is any would be better than this place. Even Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Food is good nothing to get exited. Unfortunately can't say the same about the service. It's slow understaffed not concerned about the customer and always think that apologies will solve the issue. Some and have no idea what customer service is. Have never been properly trained. If you come on Sunday's prepared to spent at least 2hrs and that is 1:15 minutes to get seated wait on take your order and bring you drinks if you have a good waitress. The other time is for food to come out to your table. I have been to the one on litchfield field and way far better service food is about the same bout your in an out in half the time.  I guess the owners have no idea what is going on or choose to ignore it. But its their business."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!  They are the best Mexican Food Restaurant I have ever had!  My family has been coming to this Restaurant since it was a hole in the wall.  We tend to go AT LEAST once a month to eat there - the servers all know my family at this point.  My family members all have their favorites.... mine is the #23 (2 shredded beef tacos, enchilada, rice and beans).  All the menu is pretty good but someo f my family favs are the Theresa's Special, Menudo (Red or White), Green Chili (excellent), Steak.... everything!  We absolutely love their chips and Salsa too!  I would recommend everyone to go.  Keep in mind this is more of Sonora Style Mexican food not other regions of Mexico."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I have ever been to a Mexican restaurant where you are told NO MORE salsa before, but I have now. The party I was with was told we cannot have any more salsa and would be charged for any extra we wanted. It also took an hour to get our tasteless food with poor service. I used to come here and it was amazing with great service but now the food is bland and just plain bad with Service that is very lacking. Not once were we even asked if we needed refills for our drinks , when you needed anything you pretty much had to flag down the 1st person you saw and then ask for what you wanted , you then had to wait at the very min 5 min before you saw them again. I will never return here to eat anything, it is nothing like it used to be."}
{"text":"This is a gem in the sw valley. I had the chicken enchiladas suizas. There was lots of chicken and it was very moist and tender. The sides of beans and rice were pretty fare but with the addition of their excellent salsa these became excellent as well. Let's talk about the salsa. So, so good! Pretty hot and very garlicky, it's some of the best I've ever tasted.  I had a margarita to wash it all down and it was alright. Not bad, but not fabulous either. I would certainly recommend this place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"I miss the old Raul & Theresa's. New management sucks and these new rules are stupid. I still took home my all you can eat food. Fuck the police!!!!"}
{"text":"Very  unsatisfied. We went there for the first time tonight and were seated. Server took at least 20-25 minutes to come take our order once we ordered we were still waiting for our food 40 minutes later. They brought us chips three times and we finally told the manager and left. The manager didn't really seem like she even cared about us leaving. Horrible customer service will never recommend"}
{"text":"I come to this place every time in in Arizona. Theresa's special is the bomb! Cool place w/ awesome Mexican food!"}
{"text":"A family run restaurant where the waitresses look like the mexican tia (auntie) you wished you had and call you \"honey\" and \"sweetie\" all while delivering great food on a very busy night. Thats Raul and Theresa's in a nut shell.   I admit it I am biased, I had them cater my wedding, but only after having great food there every time. Their green chile burro's are as good as poncho's on baseline and that is saying a lot.  To the guy complaining about the chile releno's  were nothing more than omelet's the menu actually says.... \"omelet style\", so yeah they are like an omelet.  This is one of our standby places to eat at on a friday night.  This is the mexican food I grew up at at places like this, Popo's, and Ponchos.  These places are institutions of Mexican and American Food, just like their signs say.    I am not saying this is authentic mexican food because well Mexico is a big country and the food varies from region to region but this is what I associate with sonoran th style mexican food.  Lots of red sauce, fried tacos, and great salsa. I'll be back probably within a month!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here on Tuesday afternoon. Had very pleasant and friendly service and the food was great! Absolutely loved the lunch chimi and the salsa and chips were tasty as well. Definitely recommend trying this little hole in the wall out! Only reason for the 4 start review instead of 5 was the that the place itself seemed a little run down. Need to do a lot of updating/cleaning."}
{"text":"If you want Amercanized Mexican food this is not the place for you. This place is authentic Mexican food, and it is delicious. I like to get the Theresa's Special which is super spicy and amazing. Wednesdays they have all you can eat beef tacos and cheese enchiladas which are both good, but very very filling.  I highly recommend that if you like Mexican food that you eat here, it is awesome."}
{"text":"We love R&Ts!! We go there weekly for their $5.99 lunch special (taco and enchilada w/rice & beans). Its cheap, filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"We always ask for Gloria when we visit. She is a sweet, Hispanic lady who loves to call everyone \"baby.\"  Of course, you get free chips and salsa. I love the salsa in the squeeze tube. It is freakin' addicting. The beef tacos, as well as, the sonoran enchiladas are my favorites. Beef taco is straight up yummy and on the greasy side, good amount of beef and cheese. The sonoran enchilada is a gordita with enchilada sauce, cheese, and green olives. Their rice and beans are pretty good. When we are all in a drinking mood we will grab a pitcher of Marg's.   Inside it is your typical Mexican decor - bright colors, Mexican pots and pictures, and that kinda thing."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! All around .... Menudo was tasty flavorful enough meat just the right amount of maiz had them put the patita on the side. They brought out enough cilantro onions peppers etc.. It was our 1st time going to that location well be visiting them weekly to go down the menu. There Micheladas are on point delish ... There prices are GR8.. Yea I'll be recommending them!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night. Love the authentic atmosphere, and the food was really quite good! Very large parking lot. Waiter was pleasant & professional. Do NOT sit under any of the speakers...couldn't hear myself think. Will likely return, the food was that good though."}
{"text":"I give two stars even though I love the food, however service is hit and miss. Went there last night 9-29-2016 had a taco salad with sour cream and guacamole on the side. Was so good went back for lunch today 9-30-2016 and the waitress (different from last night) had taken my order, I ordered the taco salad with sour cream and guacamole on the side, just like last night. She argued that sour cream and guacamole did not come with it. I told her I was here last night and that is how they served it. She reluctantly said ok and served it like I had it last night. Went to pay for the bill and found an additional $4.00 charge on there for the sour cream and guacamole. Never got charged last night for it!!!! I frequent This location at least 3 times a week!!!! Question for them.... You going to lose customers that are this frequent to your establishment over two small scoops of condiments that you over charge for one time and give free another?"}
{"text":"We were here on a Monday evening so it wasn't that busy.  The staff was super nice but there was only one waitress for the entire place.  So service was a bit slow.  I had the Flautas which were very hard to cut they were so overcooked.  I had also asked for beef and got chicken.  I didn't say anything though so I'm sure they would have replaced them.  However, the tamales were great and the other members of my party liked their food very much.  The ambiance was typical for a mexican restaurant.  Overall, it was a good meal but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This place has the air of an old landmark. Not from purposeful decor but because its just been there for so darn long. Sure it needs remodeling but that just adds to the charm. Its still colorful and fun. The lighting was a bit too bright for my taste.  The staff was friendly. It would have been nice if they came back to ask how our food was after they served us. But drinks were refilled without asking so I guess its a wash.  Chips were good. Salsa was good but a bit watery and hot.  I ordered the Machaca Chimichanga (9.99) and my wife the shrimp/steak fajitas. (13.00). My chimi was delish. beans and rice were a bit bland. Sour cream and guac came standard. My wife liked the fajitas. The onions and peppers were grilled to caramelized perfection. It could have used more meat. Portions were large and we ended up taking half home.  Over all it was OK. Not great. I like Macayo's and Chevy's better."}
{"text":"If you dont like Raul & Theresa's..........dont ever eat mexican again because you have no idea what you are talking about.  This place is so much fun, the food is fabulous and taste even better during the winter time....i dont know why, maybe its a mental thing."}
{"text":"Second time here First time disappointed in service, wasn't treated fairly as a single person, waitress paid more attention to bigger tables  I always give second chances, so today  Carne a Sada meat in taco was over cooked, OK well?  Let's move over to my shrimp taco.... Over cooked shrimp also  and rice wasn't fully cooked Server/waitress was OK... Just maybe in a hurry all the time?"}
{"text":"Best hot sauce I've in the west valley!!  Atmosphere: it was pretty warm in there! And not the best atmosphere..bathrooms weren't very clean!   Service: had a very sweet waitress, knew the menu very well.  Food: was very good I had the steak capato! One of my favs!   We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on my Yelp app and we ate here after the Gladiator Rock n Run.  BEST mexican food I've had in a long time!  Service was a tad slow, but they didn't anticipate the large groups coming in from the event."}
{"text":"After 4 hours of playing, I was ready for a to have a sit down meal instead of a burger. I suggested Raul and Teresa. I do live in Chandler, but have spent a lot of time on the west side. I was craving Chile Colorado (red chile con carne).  I've eaten at Raul and Teresa, but  never posted a review. Waitress was good at her job and made sure we had everything we need. After placing out orders the standard chips and salsa was delivered. Nothing special and a little bit on the small side container of chips and the salsa contained a bit much oregano which was usual to my knowledge to even be in the salsa. Meals came shortly after. I order number 23 which consisted of chili Colorado, rice, and refried beans.  The order also came with flour tortillas. I immediately tried the rice with a little of chili Colorado and too my disappointment the sauce tasted of flour and no real spice. My next taste was tortilla and chili Colorado with the meat hoping for s better result. Well same results flour taste and no    Real taste of chili Colorado. Meat was okay, a little bit much in the connective meat. So I was disappointed in the main entree but the rice was good and beans okay. Service was the best part, very pleasant!"}
{"text":"To start with, they didn't have the Mexican beer I wanted, that was listed on the menu. Not such a big deal. Chips and salsa were good, as was the cheese dip. It was hot and spicy. Thumbs up for that. Fajitas are fajitas, they seem to be same everywhere; not spectacular but good. The thing that disappointed me the most was that the corn tortillas were microwaved. If I wanted microwaved tortillas I would have went to an American restaurant. I probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. The service was fine and friendly however the food was very bland. I had the 2 flauta meal (1 chicken and 1 beef) which was tasteless.   I would not recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finding authentic, consistent food in the Phoenix area is extremely difficult. This restaurant has great sauce for the enchiladas, salsa is the best and always has great service. Coming from west Texas, a good way to tell a Mexican restaurant is good is by the beans. Beans here are excellent! A must try if you are looking for Mexican food with great service!"}
{"text":"People in Avondale often said this was the best Mexican food in the area, they are probably right. Yet there is nothing special about this place. Speaking mostly on combination plates, its just average. Don't get me wrong the taste of everything is good but they didn't set themselves apart from other places in the Phoenix area.  Service was friendly and prompt. Chips and salsa were pretty good!"}
{"text":"I called them today to place a take out order. The lady on the phone explained to me \"we are too busy to take phone orders today\". I said ok, she apologized and hung up.  I'm sorry too. I am sorry that your restaurant was TOO BUSY to make money. Oh well... Off to a restaurant not too busy to make money today."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm going to have to revise my review in a downward fashion.  Our most recent visit to this restaurant resulted in overly oily and greasy food; heavier than necessary food tastes, which could have been avoided with more careful preparation; sub-par service and an overwhelming feeling of bewilderment as to why I gave this place four stars to begin with.  The answer is simple:  I hadn't much experience with other Mexican restaurants in the Valley and didn't know any better.  But on top of all that, Raul and Theresas has simply gone downhill, with slow service, less than sparkling clean silverware; smaller portions not matching the menu descriptions and prices, which simply don't justify what you get.  Perhaps I would've been more forgiving had the food been tasty.  Sadly, what the server DID bring -- and even that wasn't correct --- didn't leave me wanting what she forgot to serve.  Sad"}
{"text":"This place just has bad food.  I've been there twice and been disappointed both times.  All I remember from the first time was the shockingly horrible rice and beans.  How does a Mexican restaurant not make good beans and rice?  The beans were bland and the rice was old and hard and like the beans, had no flavor.  The second time, I had a chile relleno, it's supposed to be an egg based batter around the chile.  This was just egg.  It was like a chile inside an omlette.  Which although not like mom used to make should taste good too but it was just swimming in oil.  This place had a ownership change a few years ago and I am certain this place is just living off of it's old reputation.  There are a few people who grew up with this place and they continue to recommend it.  Oh and don't go to the place next door either, Tony's sucks too."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The food was decent and hot at reasonable prices.  The sopa pillas were not the best as they were greasy and flat.  Overall, the place was enjoyable and I would return."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions, good price, friendly staff.  Like this location better than the one on Litchfield Rd"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant two times now and the food and the service is excellent it is the best authentic Mexican food I have ever had growing up in Southern California I definitely know what good Mexican food is and this is definitely the best I've ever had will be going back more often"}
{"text":"Don't know what to order at a Mexican food restaurant? Go for the green chile burrito enchilada style! You'll never regret this choice. This restaurant, with its homestyle decor and delicious food, is great. Good chips and salsa and this burrito was amazing. If you're ever in the west valley, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I previously had a wonderful review boasting of the comforting good eats of this establishment. This included service however I have since thought better of it & consequently removed it. Why? Because for someone who brings their family & extended family once a week. I had become friendly with some of the staff including the nicer staff with longevity to which this review does not include. Those lovely servers that have been there since the beginning of time you still rock & I will miss you & so will my family friends I have taken to Raul & Theresa's.   Last night was a Tuesday not a busy night & the parking lot reflected that. Shauna seated us in her section & took our drink order. There are 3 people in my immediate family & we ordered guac to go with the chips & salsa. After 20 minutes & a drink refill later we cancel the guac thinking the food must be almost ready the guac was intended as an appetizer not a condiment hence ordering it with the chip delivery. This same \"server\" had 2 new tables added to her section both with parties of 4 & 6. She took their orders & they received their food before we received ours. It's now been 40 minutes no food just sodas. My hubs & I look at each other & decide it's time to leave. We make a pit stop at the front to let them know we aren't dining (because we don't have any food) & dashing but definitely dashing. We explain the situation to the MOD & get a pa-thet-ic one word apology. She bought our sodas but that was it. We stood there looking at the face of the woman that has seated us, served us & taken our money once a week for some time with total befuddlement. Just can't believe that our loyalty was repaid with awful service from start to finish that day & from the MOD to boot. We will not be darkening their door step again nor will anyone we've recommended & taken ourselves. I'm sad to say that an establishment would do this to any good paying customers & think they should be ashamed from the top of the chain to the bottom! BAD RAUL & THERESA'S!"}
{"text":"We were with a group of 10 guys here for diner tonight and everybody liked whatever they ordered. I had the Carne Seca Machaca and it was really good. Guy sitting next to me had Carne Adobada, a large pork steak, marinated and grilled, it was very good.  My friend across from ordered a combination of tamale and taco, he liked it a lot. Their salsa is hot, but oh so tasty. The margaritas were excellent. The restaurant has been there for almost 40 years and if they keep serving this kind of food, they will be around for another 40."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  deffinatly off the beaten path, on the other side of the tracks, but we would drive hours to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 8 times or more, the food is not that great, the food takes about 30-45 to get to the table after you order!! The NEW Raul and Theresa's on Mcdowell and Litchfield is GARBAGE!! I ordered the fish tacos and \"I SWEAR TO GOD\" I got food poisoning!!!!  Why my family comes here... I have no Clue!!! You will be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, only complaint is that a generous order of fajitas only came with 2 very small (6 inch at best) tortillas and more cost extra not to mention you couldn't put much in them.  Staff could have been a bit friendlier like they were to the frequent fliers.  Overall, best Mexican food I've found in the West Valley in the short time I've lived here, authentic!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!!  Waited for a long time and no one came to take our order so I asked the hostess to please send our waitress over to take our order. She comes back and says she doesn't know where our waitress is so she takes our order.  We then sit for almost an hour and six tables that came after us get their food and one even finishes and leaves and we still have not gotten our food. Now I'm mad and we've only seen our waitress one time in the hour to fill our empty iced teas. Finally at an hour plus our food comes out and it is obvious it has been sitting under heat lamps for a LONG time. The cheese on the beans is burnt and hard, the beans are dry and hard and the rice is one big burnt dried out mess. My fajitas are not sizzling and actually cool. The beans were so dry and hard you could not scoop them with a chip as the chip could not get through the hard cheese and beans.  I could tell the waitress knew the food was not good as she never came back to check on us. We finally had to go to the register to get our ticket as we could not get our waitress to come over.  Won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely better than the R&T north of I-10.  The service is so-so but the food is delicious.  I like their fajitas.  I'm still waiting for the \"perfect\" Mexican food place on our side of town but this will do until then!  I rated both location 3 stars.  Although the food is better here, I think their service lacks.  It's not horrible, just not very good."}
{"text":"Blah, blah, and more blaaaah. I thought there food left much to be desired. I did like the shabby, but cute atmosphere. Our waitress forgot about us and we sat for about 15 minutes before my boyfriend had to go ask for our check.  I got the shrimp fajitas. I always order this at mexican restaurants and it's never so so. It's always really bad or really good -- here, it was really bad. My boyfriend liked his food, but didn't looove it. The salsa was bland, but hot and I've had better chips at chain restaurants. I didn't get to tried the fried ice cream because our waitress kept us waiting too long and we would've been late for a movie. As a side note, True Grit was quite good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant anytime I come to AZ I come eat here. Great customer service. Amazing food, as tho it does taste as they have changed there salsa a little more tomato then I remember. But over all Amazing good great atmosphere wonderful happy staff and amazing prices ! 5/5 recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Here for a baseball tournament. Lots of talk about Raul and Theresa's among attendees. Guess the people I was listening to have never had good Mexican restaurant food as Raul and Theresa's Mexican food is as pedestrian as it gets. We had three different dishes; chile verde,green and red burrito and a taco combo plate. No plate was finished. We are a Mexican family with old family roots that produce some outing dishes. We try not to compare restaurant food with home cooked as nothing compares to home cooked but we do have a base to compare. And, Raul and Theresa's does not make the grade for authentic or good tasting Mexican fare. Good service, nice setting, little out of the way and not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"We have been to Raul & Theresa's a few times.  Let me start by saying that my wife is hispanic and has spent alot of time in Mexico eating authentic Mexican food.  We are not impressed.  The decor is old and not very clean.  The whole place smells like cooking oil and so will your clothes when you leave.  The food is over spiced and still not very tasty.  I dont think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Always good food- chorizo, fajitas, burritos... always good.  Friendly staff and family owned. We return a few times a month."}
{"text":"I have been here countless times. I'm floored by the number of poor reviews. I've had Mexican food all over the country and this is a fav. Love the Taco and Enchilada Wednesdays, love the Chimi's, love the burros, love it all. The family is always present and are sweet as can be. If you don't like Raul and Theresa's, I don't know if I like you."}
{"text":"We usually go to the restaurant off of I-10. Raul and Theresa's has great food, but the service at this location is not great. We've been here multiple times, and we never get a good waitress. The busboys even provide better service than the waitresses we've had. But despite the bad service, we still come here for the awesome food."}
{"text":"The rice was dry, the chips were cold, the tacos and cheese enchilada were sub-par.  My son and I went there last night and both of us got food poisoning.  He ordered the beef tacos with rice and beans and I got the beef taco with cheese enchilada & rice and beans.  This morning it started - the elimination process of FOOD POISONING.  Went on recommendations even though a few said they got food poisoning - never again.,"}
{"text":"Went again to try the food. Still badly seasoned. Their tacos are not seasoned right and they tasted old. Enchiladas sauce has way too much red chile powder that it leave a sour taste in your mouth. Most people can not taste the difference, but since I am Theresa's great niece. Worked in the kitchen along side my Aunt Theresa till I was 18. Learned everything from her and was the head cook for almost 20 years. I have put up with enough bs from these restaurants. It's so sad that my aunt's good name is going to go down with the ship.."}
{"text":"Arrived at lunch on a Friday with a Groupon.  I was surprised at how large the place was although it was not particularly busy.  The server was friendly and quick to the table as was the free chips and salsa.  The salsa was different in that it had the consistency of a bottle of 'taco sauce' or ketchup but I thought it was surprisingly tasty.  It is a sauce so not chopped up tomatoes, peppers, etc. Chips were also good.  My wife had the lunch special (taco and enchilada) while I had the chile colorado which I always order if it is available on a menu.   She reported that it was 'good' not exceptional and my chile colorado, I felt, was a little bland.  However, everyone's taste is different and others may like it.  However, it was a very large portion and I had to make sure I ate the chile colorado with only a little rice and beans or I would not have been able to finish it!   My only complaint is that we did not see our server again (and I would have liked to try a little more of the salsa) and then we had to wait a little too long for the bill but the restaurant had gotten busier by that time as well, so that perhaps played into the delay.   Seemed like a good place to take a group as there was plenty of room (and there was one group there of about 12) and the decor was nice and the parking lot was large."}
{"text":"I loved the building and the decor. The food wasn't amazing. I ordered the shrimp burrito and it was pretty average. I also had a Michelada, the presentation was great but they used to much lemon/lime juice...I would have appreciated a little more Clamato or Chili. Maybe next time I'll ask that they add it."}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada taco which we don't do again.   Talk very wet.  Carbs asada morning to write about so buff said.  Shredded beef tacos were better but also real wet and eventually slimy.  The shredded beef is quite tender and tasty as it seems to be shredded and chopped.  Had a blessed margarita which was excellent.  Would love to order shredded beef taco again but the tortilla just was so wet and slimy not sure we can do it"}
{"text":"Was there for brunch today and my overall experience was good!! I ordered red menudo and it was delicious!!  My daughter order a breakfast burrito (eggs, bacon, potatoes and cheese) which was huge and good (so she said). My wife ordered Green Sour cream enchiladas which come with rice and beans. Wife liked her food as well. I tried her meal and I liked rice and beans, but the enchiladas not so much.  Loved the ice tea. It tasted fresh and best of all was not cloudy like it usually is in many restaurants.  I would definitely come back and try something else from their menu."}
{"text":"We still keep coming back to R & T's and really enjoy it each time!  Keep up the good work and love the hot sauce they bring in the squeeze bottle in addition to the salsa."}
{"text":"It was my time in the Phoenix area and Raul and Theresa's was recommended.  It definately didn't disappoint, service was excellent (staff was quick to fill up chips, salsa, and our drinks), food was pretty good, and the prices was great.  I'll definately be going back next time I'm down in the area."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD AT ALL. The food is not as good as the good old days. The waitress was rude and not helpful. The best thing from this restaurant by far was this sweet older man that may be a bus boy but he also filled in as the waiter. The waitress was late and he picked up after her. He gets alone 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm coming back here, the eggs my last order we undercooked and the server forgot our drink order twice. I ordered the Menudo (red) it tasted a little bland but the tripe was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the Phoenix area and are on a mission to find a Mexican restaurant.  My husband and I agree the meals at Raul and Teresa's were excellent. I had the Enchilada Suiza and the Tamotio sauce was to perfect. I really like their salsa. My husband had a Chimichanga and really liked it as well."}
{"text":"I do not know why, but my experiences here have never been good. It is not the wait for a table that bothers me, hell you wait and that is the way it is. I do mind that it has never taken less than 25 munities once seated to get service. I am not kidding either; folks who go with me are always amazed. Once we finally get an order in it takes another 25 or more. WHY WHY WHY? We get our food, sometimes it verges on good and more often than not just uninspired. I have given this place so many chances I just can not continue."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets!  I come here with a co-worker for lunch. He said it's great Mexican food.   We get there and it's this huge restaurant. I had high expectations.   7.99 lunch chimi special? So good.   I would totally reccomend going here in you're in the area.   The service was good, but I had to ask for things a few times. All in all good experience!"}
{"text":"Had a cheese enchilada and a Chile rellano. Rellano was ok but enchilada was not good at all. There beans also have no flavor. The salsa with chips is decent"}
{"text":"Right now I am sooo annoyed, I called in an order and while the woman was taking my order she was carrying on with her fellow coworkers. I would say something and no response until she was done then she would repeat what she said before ignoring me. I should of just hung up and made other plans for lunch. Now I'm sitting here at home with a incomplete and wrong order. I called back got the same girl and she acted like ohhhh well. I hate bad customer service and bad phone skills."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem in Avondale. Everything was good...the chips & salsa, the food, and ofcourse the margaritas! We were ordering those margaritas by the pitcher (each one better after the other)!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been for breakfast/brunch, but I never leave disappointed. I love the cheese enchiladas with over easy eggs on top. Food is always out fast. My only complaint is many times the chips and fairly spicy salsa come out quite a while before drinks are delivered, leaving me always questioning why I didn't wait for my water before digging in. Other than that my experiences are always great and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars had the service not been lacking.  Whether its because the waitress was overwhelmed, or they were understaffed...not sure.  We went there for lunch and it took over an hour, so I won't be going there again for lunch because I only get an hour lunch break.  The positive was...great food, the bussers are super friendly.  I woulda rather tipped him than the waitress.  I had a chimi and it was GOOOOOOD!! yum!  I will go there for dinner when I am not on a time constraint."}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice staff. Awesome food with great prices. You can't go wrong with anything you choose ftom menu.    They serve breakfast all day if that's you thing, definitely worth a try and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Cute spot, very friendly service, excellent drinks and great salsa! I ordered the machaca seca, not authentic but okay."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents and two daughters.   Very beautiful restaurant inside and out.   The waitress was attentive and helpful after browsing their very large menu.   My father raved about their cerviche, he said it was really good.   Our plates came out fast and are food was pretty decent.   Would return to eat when I am in the mood for Mexican food.  Only downfall: all the food was made with corn tortillas instead of flour. Wasn't given the option to change it either when I ordered the enchiladas."}
{"text":"We ordered beef chimichangas with rice and beans. Salsa was spicy. Good place to eat. Service was quick."}
{"text":"First time visiting here and I was surprised. The food and service was great and they had plenty of table in there on a Tuesday night. I will be visiting this location again in the future!"}
{"text":"I still can't figure out why everyone likes this place. The food is not very good and the wait takes forever, not to mention food is overpriced. I have gone multiple times as others like this place and I've been asked to join. Something as simple as a burrito should always include rice and beans, it doesn't here. Even the meat is fatty and not very tasty. No R&Ts for me, I'd rather pay over $10 for a burrito somewhere else."}
{"text":"We used Raul & Theresa's for a group dinner.  They packaged everything in large aluminum containers that were easy to fit in back of suv.  Everything was great and we had plenty of food.  Loved the carne Asada tacos and the cheese enchiladas!!! Fair price and friendly staff.  Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Sonoran style Mexican food at its best - if you know how and what to order. If you're looking for the Macayo, Manuel's experience, sure, you can find those items on the menu - but why? You're eating at an Arizona original, where most of my friend's parents and grandparents would eat, long before the Mexican chains came into existence. So you'll see things like thin cut pork chops and fries. And delicious menudo. And, they offer fried jalapenos, sweated to perfection.  On this visit, I ordered Theresa's plate. It reminded me of my late friend's father who routinely cooked the same dish for his family using his passed-down recipe. Spectacular.  My wife has lived in Arizona nearly all her adult life and I've never taken her to Raul & Theresa's.  Shame on me for not making the hour-long drive before today. It's now her favorite. If your roots are in Arizona or Mexico, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is my favorite Mexican food place in the whole valley. The chips and salsa taste very fresh and the salsa has the right amount of spiciness! I'm in love with the #26, which is the red chile plate that comes with rice and beans. I'm not too much of a rice or beans fan...but the beans are served piping hot with melted cheese- and the rice is very fluffy and tastes perfectly seasoned with garlic. The staff is always courteous. We usually get seated right away even though this place is usually buzzing with business."}
{"text":"Never Disappoints   With so many Mexican Food Restaurants do any really stand out above the rest?  If you have to ask that question then you have never been to Raul and Teresa's.  The West Valley has had its share of good Mexican restaurants.  So what makes Raul and Theresa's stand out? For starters, it's not the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's are excellent. The entrees are flavorful, served hot, and plated perfectly. Today, I had the taco and enchilada lunch combo and it was delicious.  Raul and Theresa's has two locations, one on Litchfield Road and the original location off of M-85 ( I prefer the M-85 location).    Raul and Theresa's has a very relaxed atmosphere, plenty of room for large parties, and is kid friendly.  The service and food  is absolutely wonderful. If your in the area and hungry for Mexican Food stop by Raul a d Theresa's  you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"As a resident of Avondale, I take pride in Raul and Theresa's.  The food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable.  The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is the lackluster service.  The salsa is awesome and they have by far the BEST fajitas in Phoenix - I order the shrimp and beef."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his famiy have been going to Raul and Theresa's all his life, so one morning when I was hungry for Mexican food, he decided to take me here, and I'm addicted. I had something I've never had before: a cheese enchilada with a fried egg on top. Different to me, but not to others. I especially loved the chips and salsa. I always love the chips and salsa. The staff was very friendly and brought us more salsa, chips, and drinks when needed. One visit, my boyfriend ate cactus. I've gotta say it was pretty delicious, but there was too much sauce on it. Still, it was a unique dish and I enjoyed it more than him.I will continue going to this place, as I am a huge fan of those mom and pop places rather than chains. Good job Raul and Theresa's. You have made us very happy."}
{"text":"If you eat here and don't like it, please leave the state immediately because you have no future here.   The place was packed with old-time Avondalers on a Friday night. White and Hispanic alike. It's so far off the beaten path from where out of state newcomers have moved in as part of Phoenix's suburban sprawl, that it has a completely local flavor and feel for it that I'm sure has not changed since the day it opened in 1968. Main Street itself, cutting through \"downtown Avondale\", is a trip back to yesteryear.   The salsa deserves six stars. You get a bowl of the regular tasty stuff. Then, plunked down right next to it, is a SECOND bowl of chopped salsa veggies like tomatoes, onions and the rest. Thus, you're free to mix up some chunky salsa according to your own unique personal preferences. YUM."}
{"text":"Lunch special fajita enough for two even after our 5 mile hike! Excellent salsa. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Please do not categorize yourself under Mexican food, your just giving it a bad name. The food is absolutely not authentic or maybe the times that I've gone the person cooking wasn't the same as in these other reviews.   In some of my other reviews I've talked about what to look for before ordering. Well if they offer you free chips and salsa and the chips are hard and stale. Pay for your drink and run out of the door like now!   Just try some of the other smaller businesses around you might find something way better."}
{"text":"Wow, huge change in food. Way better and bigger. The flautes were larger and fried to perfection. Daughter got two shredded beef tacos and she lived them. This place has made a big come back and is biker friendly with spots at the front door."}
{"text":"Great food,  loved both the Theresa's special and the Grand PA taco. Good hot salsa, and good margaritas,  what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could but this place will not stay in business the way the treat customers. Horrible service, bad attitude, and way over priced. My In-laws ordered their plate and couldn't take their leftovers because it was all you could eat night. Two enchiladas, are not worth $9.99! They said they'd rather throw these tacos away instead of give my father-in-law a to go box. He didn't order more this was his first plate! I will never come back and I encourage everyone I know to stay far away! They rather push you to over eat than take what is yours. It makes me so mad to throw waste and throw away food. MAKES NO SENSE!!!"}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico and only about 20 minutes away from Hatch, I find that I am very picky about my Mexican food!    I'm not saying that this is the end all be all of Mexican cuisine in the valley, but for some reason...it just helps me not miss home so much.   I am usually very critical of a restaurants red chile.  I could tell before tasting it that their red chile sauce is made from a powder, which I am typically not a fan of.   However, R & T's red chile sauce has a very delicious taste! Their rice is perfect and not at all sticky and pasty like you find in many restaurants.  Their beans are very good and you always get a decent amount on your plate.    I usually get the combo with 2 red enchiladas and 1 beef taco.  The tacos are delicious and you can tell that the corn tortilla is freshly fried to order.    On one occasion, I did try the green chile and I will not be trying it again.  It is nothing like home or like anything that I've ever had.  I'll stick to the red sauce!  What makes this a 4-star review for me is the staff.  We always sit in the back bar area and are always served by one of two women who are so friendly and helpful and remind of the places back home!    Buen Provecho!   P.S.  I have never ordered this, but friends have...on Wednesdays (at the original location), they have all-you-can-eat tacos and enchiladas for $9.99!!!"}
{"text":"This is the original location. There is now an additional location in Goodyear. This one does have a home feel and the building has a lot of character, but the other location is more like a regular restaurant, which you might prefer it if you are claustrophobic or don't like being in tight quarters with strangers.  The food is always fantastic. The enchilada sauce is the best I have ever had. I could drink it!! Food is consistent between locations and visits. Portions are generous. Prices between $7 and $13. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The first time my husband & I went to this restaurant our friends had told us about this place how clean the establishment is and how delicious the food is also they explained about the chief Joel that he was a original there for a really long time, I had ordered the chilireillanno Also came with rice & beans let me tell you that was the best tasting melt in your mouth Mexican food I've ever ate and my husband ordered the carne asada tacos his order also included  the delicious rice & delicious beans and he as well said how delicious the food is our friends also were present as they enjoyed a beautiful shrimp cocktail  totally amazing food. My husband took me on a early lunch date a few days ago but I had started on my Atkins diet so I was concerned about carb intake and looking through the menu  when this lovely lady Lucy brought us chips & salsa and Lucy was so polite to us and she was very caring as well (chips) I had a few omg the amazing salsa to die for I was able to order a spinach omelette with other vegetables inside at the time of ordering I asked the wonderful waitress Esmeralda if there was a way to order  carne asada on the same place with the omelette and also please remove the potatoes & toast since I was watching my carb intake Esmeralda took very special care on my order that  chef Joel had made was so delicious &  My husband ordered a Chimney  he couldn't believe his eyes when his meal arrived with the delicious shredded beef  such beautiful presentation and his comment was that was the best he had ever eaten we will definitely make this our top priority and we have told so many people about This Jewel Of A Restaurant just located off Main Street/ MC85 I wanted more people to know so they can experience the Best Mexican Restaurant In Arizona."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner, was seated quick. They sat 3 tables after us, brought everyone chips but for us. Waited about 7 to 10 mins and still nothing. Just walked out. Really big bummer cause this place used to be amazing."}
{"text":"I thought I have written a review already, but nope! OK, this is my 3rd trip to Raul and Theresa's. The first time, food and service was good. The second time, food was just bl-eh and service was good. Third time, both food and service was excellent. Gloria is the bomb!! Woot woot...   I had the chimi again and Gloria asked if I wanted it with sauce and cheese on top (the first 2 times, they never asked). It was VERY good with the extras on top, WOW!!!. The queso dip with shredded beef was AWESOME!!!! I could not stop eating it. The chips just kept coming!!! Hubby ordered a steak picado with corn tortilla, he LOVED it."}
{"text":"I struggle to understand how this place has a high rating and a full parking lot. This place was dirty, the restaurant looked like it hasn't had any maintenance done to the inside in 20 years, the dishes and glasses didn't match, they were out of everything our table ordered... Which I actually didn't even order after I sat at the table and realized how horrible this place looked. How does this place pass any sort of inspection?"}
{"text":"Good food, Good service. If you haven't been here on a Wed you have to try it, all you can eat tacos and enchiladas.  The only reason I gave it three instead of four stars is the inconsistencies with the food an service."}
{"text":"My Favorite place, so much better than the Litchfield location...   Love the food, service is fair.  This place does get busy though."}
{"text":"Love their steak picado! Good Mexican food and they provide many options. The guacamole is delicious and their chips and salsa are addicting. They offer an all you can eat taco and enchilada night on Wednesdays. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was really good!  The portions are large but you can save some for later!  The only down side is that the service was slow but value and flavor make up for the service"}
{"text":"Seems like you either like the place or not...me, I like the place.  Good, authentic Mexican cuisine, at an affordable price - humongous portions; one where in a MAN verses FOOD competition, FOOD WINS!  Chips are a bit oily, but thick; salsa is spicy - a bit saucy, not chucky.  (I prefer the chuncky type.)  Definitely an establishment waaaaay off the beaten path, literally on the other side of the railroad tracks - you need to know about the place to enjoy because you will cross the tracks to get to the place.  Locals know of the place.  Visitors discover the place talking to the locals - I visited in mid-March, right during the beginning of Spring training so the place was a mix of locals and visitors alike...  $15 pitchers of STRONG marguaritas - extensive Mexican biers (Texate, Dos XX - amber and lager; Corona, etc.).  Would be better if the biers were on tap."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in all of Arizona! Nicest staff, great service, traditional WONDERFUL Mexican food. I drive from Mesa to have this food. If you love traditional Mexican food like I do, GO EAT THERE!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here a few weeks ago for some salsa and margaritas.  Good salsa and decent margaritas.  Great value."}
{"text":"Just left here and must say I am utterly disappointed in the food, and terrible excuse of service we had. First we sat for 10 minutes before we were even asked for our drink orders! Secondly we had finally put in our orders for food and had been sitting for a bit and a couple was seated by us and got their food about 10 minutes after sitting! How does that even happen? We waited another 15 minutes before getting our meals and were finally brought refills after asking and sitting there with no drinks for the past 20 minutes. Our server checked on us once the entire time we were there and the food was disgusting. Fajitas were 80% vegetables(with PICKLED jalapeños) and 20% meat, chimichanga wasn't much better unless you like yours filled with onions and bell peppers and a little meat. Our bill was $50, needless to say i will never return or recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Skip the chain restaurants and visit this local delight. The food was great, customer service was amazing. Not a fancy place, but is clean and spacious. Ladies room soap dispenser was broken was only negative. We visited the location in Avondale and we will be going back again!"}
{"text":"My husband used to go here for the Menudo on Sunday, he says it was as close to his Grandma's that he has had yet.  We no longer go here because of the health ratings that this place has had. They were almost shut down because it was so bad. Apparently the kitchen is very dirty and in need of a lot of repair.   You can read the reports at http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=Food"}
{"text":"Stopped in there tonight with my wife after discovering the old town Avondale fiesta was a big bust!! Immediately got seated at the bar and served beers right away!  Food orders were taken right away, too!  I finished my beer and waited 18 minutes for a refill... I even attempted to \"flag down\" the bartender several times, with zero results!!  In the meantime, my wife who is NOT a beer drinker finished her beer and realized that it would be opportune to order her second and last beer.... Food arrived, and I must say, it was delicious! Tamales were a little light on filling, but the Masa was great!  The rice and beans were acceptable, rice was dry, but with a little added salsa, it was ok! Watched the bartenders make blended margaritas... only a thimble full of tequila! Do NOT order one here.... and the other margaritas are pre made and poured from a tap!  Lost 2 stars, right there!!! All in all... Don't go there if you want to meet me there, because I won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst food I have ever received at a restaurant. I ordered a chicken burrito. What I received was unseasoned chicken on a tortilla. That's it. Nothing else. I'm not sure you can call this a burrito, or a Mexican restaurant for that matter. Do yourself a favor and NEVER EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I have no clue why people enjoy restaurants like this one. the only good thing about places like these is the service is decent and it's a place to get cheap drinks. The food is cheap and I would rather go to any taco stand to get better quality of food for a better price."}
{"text":"Worst I have ever had. The chili rellano was dry, not much cheese and couldn't cut it with a knife. What I could get was chewy and not any flavor.   The chicken burrito  was plain chicken wrapped in a tortilla.  No refried beans, no rice, no salsa, just plain chicken.  Price was not shy, but an experience I am willing to try again. Wife was very disappointed in her meal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for AUTHENTIC then this is DEF the place to go!  I have a set order for every \"authentic\" Mexican place and it's; green chile burrito, enchilada style with green sauce.  If a place can make that taste great then they are good in my book. I have tried this at many places and have to say that Raul & Theresa's is by far my favorite.  Not only is the burrito on point but their salsa....the chips....the rice!!! yummmm, now I'm making myself hungry and my mouth is watering.  Seriously though, if you have any out of towners visiting and are looking for the best Mexican food spot in AZ, DEF take them here!"}
{"text":"Took the family on a weekend! Food was good overall. Service was good as well!   Fuimos un fin de semana con familia. La comida estaba buena. El servicio estaba más o menos también."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the waitress we had (I wish I remembered her name) was the sweetest, most attentive waitress I've had at ANY establishment. The prices are a bit high, in my opinion, but for an occasional \"special\" night, it's okay. :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. I ordered the Sonoran enchiladas and they were delicious!!! I will definitely be back for the food. I have to try Theresa's special.   Now the bad part was the margaritas. When I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect a great margarita. The drinks we ordered tasted like the pre made bottles of margaritas sold at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Early dinning at its finest! Great salsa and chips to start with. Fabulous margaritas and yummo main courses. Kids menu is super easy to follow and order from too."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. I was very upset tonight when I ordered take out, the food was not good. Wont be going back!!"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment the waitress is always they always  refill your drinks they make sure you have chips and salsa and the food is authentic and hot when served my husband is in love with their menudo. They have several lunch specials so if you're on a budget this is the place to find good food my husband and I can normally eat for about $25."}
{"text":"Twelve years ago my wife's uncle took me to R&Ts and told me to get Theresa's Special, deep fried and enchilada style.  I've never ordered anything else.  It's fantastic, and has held up for all that time.  Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Husband and I really enjoy this restaurant.  They recently opened up a new one on Litchfield, but we prefer this one.  I love the hominess of it, and the history of the building, at least it looks that way.  I'm not a big salsa person, but my husband loves it here.  I prefer the guacamole, which is probably the best I've ever had.  I'll be honest, I slather it on everything I can.  I also love their enchiladas, I get the ground beef.  My husband prefers the cheese enchiladas, along with their beans and rice.  We always leave satisfied, and that's saying a lot.  In our history with this restaurant, I've had one imperfect meal.  We went back a few weeks later, and it must've been just one bad night, because it's been wonderful ever since.  The staff has always been friendly, and we love that when we order our ice teas, they bring us a pitcher.  I'm a big fan of that, so I don't keep having to ask for more.  When I moved out here over 8 1/2 years ago, I wasn't too big on Mexican food.  This is one of the first places my husband brought me to, and I've loved it ever since."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 12 years.  I have always loved the food, and every single friend I've taken has also loved it.  Now they go when they can, and recommend it to others.  It's true that I've gone on nights where it takes some time to get a table, and I've been there when it took a very long time to get food.  However, that has only happened to me a handful of times in 12 years so I can get over it.  Besides, it usually happens when they are short staffed on that night.  My only real complaint is that for some reason there's this one fly that continues to live in there and just flies around everywhere.  Very annoying.  The place is local, almost dive-ish, it's not fancy.  It's a great little joint and I crave 'em about once a week.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Raul & Theresa's for lunch on Valentine Day.  The whole experience was so beautiful and romantic.  They got us in right away, our waitress was so friendly and got our food to us quickly. They have the best chips and salsa ever!  They had the most amazing Spanish musician serenading everyone at the perfect pitch and volume, he even took and knew a couple requests.    But by far the MOST AMAZING part of the entire visit was this guy, older gentleman, I think he said Gregory was his name.  Watching him work and his attentiveness to back up the staff on a busy day with their customers, I thought for sure this must be the owner.    As we ended our wonderful experience, I asked our waitress, is that the owner and she said no, he is a busser.  I called him over before we left and told him I had thought he was the owner, he laughed and said no.  I told him then if you are not the owner, you must be working for the Lord, he smiled and said yes I am, everytime.  I told him if I owned a restaurant, I would offer him a job at the highest level because clearly this is not an \"average\" worker, he works in \"excellence\".    Thank you Raul & Theresa's for a wonderful romantic Valentine experience and thank you for the beautiful rose on my way out the door.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Well I just moved from the West Side and found myself missing Raul and Theresa's. A newer one opened in Goodyear and that is where I started going for Mexican food once it opened. Much better ambiance then the older one. Anyway I never ordered machaca and eggs normally but this is the best. After my husband ordered it a few times I had to get my own plate. It's delicious and they serve it for lunch as well if you ask. We miss it. The service at the Goodyear location is better too!"}
{"text":"Weekend mornings... I crave their menudo. Best thing is I can ask for it the way I like it most: more maize and with red chile. Service is prompt and done with a smile. I have also had their chile colorado and fajitas (great menu items)"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss.  I've been here a few times and the food is great, but the place is dirty.  There were flies flying around. The waiter was very nice and helpful but got the orders wrong. No big deal because he fixed it right away. I suggest you take your food to-go. It's one of the best Mexican place out there, but the place is not very appetizing. Also, the water tasted funky. Other than that, the portion is great!"}
{"text":"Go to Taco Bell, you will get better food, better service, and get it quicker. Oh, and that Taco Bell could be on the moon and you would still get it quicker. Waiting more than an hour for food is simply not acceptable...unless it is being airdropped onto the ice of the South Pole (where if there was a Taco Bell, you would still get it quicker even after getting there on a dog sled pulled by one miniature Chihuahua). The food was always five minutes away...sort of like the cable repairman. Best thing to do is order now...if you want dinner in August. We LOVE authentic Mexican food and appreciate (and reward) good service..unfortunately, this place offers neither and its clear by other reviews, this is an ongoing issue. I think when they named it \"Original Restaurant\", they meant it was like caveman times when the men left for weeks to hunt for food and returned to feed the clan.   In possibly unrelated news, my daughter developed toxic flatulence. They smell like tacos and disappointment."}
{"text":"Raul y Theresa's is a monument in the West Valley.  I grew up in Tolleson and went every Friday night when I was young.  My dad still goes every Wednesday for the all you can eat enchiladas.  We go for family occasions because we need A LOT of seating (usually 10-15 people), and this place can always accommodate.  Plus, everyone can find something on the menu that is an old favorite.  Try the Theresa's special."}
{"text":"Servers were to busy cleaning to serve us.  Walked in & the hostess was on her personal cell phone never said hello, just sat us at our table & gave us our menu's.  Salsa was good, but the chips were all broken up & stale..  We should have left, but the tacos were good the last time we were here.  Brought our food, & never came back to check on us, she went back to sweeping the floor.  I had to call out for help to get a refill on our drinks.  NOT going back.  The management of this restaurant needs to figure out there help/servers are ruining their business!"}
{"text":"For almost 2 years my husband and I have been saying we should try this place so today when it was just me out to run a long list of errands I decided to stop in. Not very busy at exactly noon on a Friday. I was greeted immediately by a server who brought me chips and salsa and then brought me a glass of iced tea and even a pitcher of it to refill. That should have given me a clue. I put my order in just 5 minutes after the tea arrived. I tried to like the salsa and chips but just couldn't. The salsa was extremely hot ( I love spicy ) but this had a bitter after taste in addition to being overly spicy (maybe because they seemed to use all the seeds and membranes in their salsa). The chips were hard and tasted almost stale. Time was going by and I kept busy looking at my emails on my phone. Soon I got a bit curious why my food hadn't arrived yet so I tried to flag my waitress down but she ignored me. I saw a couple who just got their drinks same time I did and they were leaving. Another family 2 tables over came in sometime after I had ordered and they were halfway through their meal. I looked at the time and noticed it had been 40 minutes since I had ordered. This time I flagged down a waitress willing to speak with me. She said she would check on my food. She came back and said sorry they had lost your ticket but they are getting it ready now. Food arrived in less than 5 minutes. From that time on nobody came by my table at all. Food was average at best and a bit greasy. When I had drank the entire pitcher of tea ( guess that is so they don't have to get you refills) and finished all I was going to eat I couldn't get anyone to bring me a check. 3 waitresses standing at front by register talking for past 10 minutes so I went to register. The woman rang up my bill and to my surprise there was no further apology for the lost order or extremely long wait and nothing on my bill had been adjusted. I paid the bill and left with the knowledge that I would never bother with this place again. A major mistake like losing your food order for 40 minutes is cause for an apology from management and at the very least an adjustment on the cost of the meal. We eat out often and value good customer service but for this reason I can't give this place anything higher than one star and they get that for the fresh and tasty ice tea."}
{"text":"Love their food it is Amazing !! We had our Wedding Reception there and they were super accommodating the food was hot the space was perfect , private they let us come the evening before and decorate. It was a lot of fun , we had our own DJ . The price was On point !!! Staff was professional thank you !!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food friendly staff and they have orange Fanta! Love this place, it's a little pricey but it's worth it. I remember back when they used to have a rat and roach problem but it looks like that has been taken care of. I will be coming back here again and again, great place."}
{"text":"So I've ALWAYS been a HUGE supporter of the \"Original\" R&T but lately it's gone to shit.   This evening my family and I went there for dinner. We were one of 3 tables in the whole place that was seated. The food sucked and the service was horrible, especially since the place was empty.  *The chz Crisp was soggy *The tortilla chips looked like they dumped all the crumbs from the bottom of the bag into our dish (we seriously did not have a single whole chip) *The Beef/Chx fajitas was gross. Mainly peppers & onions. Beef was mainly gristle & chx was dry.  *we sat w empty sodas, beers & margaritas 3 separate  times. my husband finally had to get up and go to the bar to get all of us refills. *they did not remove a single empty cup, plate or dish the whole time we were there. As someone whom use to wait tables & cocktail, there's nothing worse they leaving all the empties on a table, ESPECIALLY when the food arrives.   Worst of all, the staff was playing w a barefoot baby in a diaper,that was clearly someone's family, running all around the restaurant & kept putting him/her on top of the tables for him/her to walk all over. Tables that people freaking eat on, with his/her dirty bare feet! Not only is this extremely unsanitary but it's just flat out disgusting!   That did it for me! We will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carnitas chimichanga. It was a little dry and skimpy on the meat. The salsa that came with the chips was overwhelmed with raw garlic. I couldn't even eat it and what's Mexican food without the chips and salsa?!"}
{"text":"This place was awful. I'd rather have Taco Bell. The salsa was tomato sauce with cayenne pepper in it. My dinner had no flavor AT ALL and the service was slow at best. Our love of Mexican cuisine has spanned generations and if this is what's consider good Mexican food in the west valley then I'll keep driving to other side of town. Very sad."}
{"text":"Good but greasy Mexican restaurant with those 'damn they're so fried but damn they're delicious' chips and spicy salsa to start. Beware, even the soft tacos are deep fried. But, it's tasty, it's cheap, and service couldn't be nicer."}
{"text":"So there are two things I MUST visit when I go to Arizona:  1. My Family 2. Raul and Theresa's!!!  Seriously, if you don't love the food here, you must be INSANE!  Talk about authentic Mexican cuisine!  It is the best!  I literally am scraping my plate clean with my TONGUE every time I come here!  Enchiladas....GOOD...Tacos...GOOD...Specials...GOOD....Beans...GOOD!  Nuff said people!"}
{"text":"I don't get why people are giving this place a hard time. Is it because it's not enough like a Mexican chain? I mean come on, Phoenix. I was just passing through, but I was on an epic Mexican food binge that started in San Antonio, via Santa Fe. This place stood up to the food we'd eaten along the way, and we thought the space itself was very attractive. The servers were really nice, explaining the unusual menu to us gringos. I had some sort of marinated beef in my enchilada that was extraordinarily good (it wasn't the carne asada... I didn't care for the carne asada). I wish I remember what it was called!! I tried really hard to remember, but I failed all of you. Just ask what everythign is that you've never heard of, and order the beef chunks marinated with onions. The carnitas were good too."}
{"text":"Amazing nachos with beans and Beef green chili.  Perfect lunch shareable app with a couple cold Modelos."}
{"text":"The service is terrible it there was like 2 other tables and it took forever for them to take our order. Then we had some issues with to-go boxes and one service saying she would bring us some and then have another one say she can't . With it being as empty as it was you would think the service would be good .... I will never come back again and it's a shame because the food is actually good service not so much"}
{"text":"Tried this place years ago, while I was in the area decided to give it a try.  Sunday brunch time is definitely the busy time of the day. I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob, so the Huevos Rancheros were prepared differently then I'm used up. While it was different it was not bad at all.  The refried beans were my favorite.  My only complaint is I came from watching a sport outside in 100 degree weather, and the restaurant was not overly cold."}
{"text":"Rude, slow, unresponsive, and incompetent staff from the hostess to the server.  The service is about as bad as I have experienced anywhere.  It took us nearly an hour to get one enchilada each after being seated.  My wife bit into her chicken enchilada and was greeted by several chicken bones.  The rice was mush on one side of the plate and almost raw on the other.  The sauce for my Sonoran Enchilada was awful.  The only thing I can say positive is that the salsa was good and I eventually managed to get a refill on water before I left.  Still not enough to earn anything more than the minimal score possible.  This one goes on my no-go list."}
{"text":"Love this place, I feel like I'm back in Tucson. A must visit if you love Sonoran style Mexican food. The margaritas by the pitcher are also great. Don't bother with the knockoff Raul and Theresa's the original is the only one that matters."}
{"text":"We ate at this place back in January but I haven't had a lot of time to write reviews. So I'm starting to review the places on my list. We came here after trying the Raul Y Theresas on Litchfield. The decor in the restaurant really needs an update. I understand it's old and has been there a long time but it's kind of run down and needs a face lift. We went with a sort of large group- my mom, stepdad, and sister were in town so we all went over there to check it out. I ordered shredded beef tacos because my sister had tried them at the Litchfield road location and they were great there. Mine were kind of overcooked on the outside and were not as good as the ones at the other Raul and Theresa's, so I was kind of bummed.  My husband got the Chorizo Burro with egg and cheese. He had the same thing at the other location and liked it better the first time. He said it was overcooked at this location (Avondale).  The waitress was nice but she kept calling everybody \"baby\" which was a little weird that she was saying it to my stepdad in front of my mother. Also we needed more drinks and I had to go get the waitress to order them because she was sitting down with her sisters chit chatting instead of checking on our table. The thing I liked about the restaurant was they brought some rice in a separate bowl for my baby without me even asking. That was nice. Later on my stepdad got a very upset stomach and he thinks it was from whatever he ate. I am not sure what dinner he ate.  I've had way better food. I don't know of any other decent Mexican places in Goodyear or Avondale. If you have any good suggestions please contact me."}
{"text":"We had the Machuca con Huevos and they were good but better after adding the excellent salsa."}
{"text":"I've eaten at R & T's always hoping that the something on the menu would have flavor, but I've been disappointed each time.  The ambience is charming in an old-Mexico sort of way, but the food is very bland.  Once I found Tony's Cafe (about 1/4 mile east of R & T's), I was in Mexican food heaven!  Tony's has much, much better food."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners here and love the food, but what is happening with the service?  Appears there are staffing problems.  Last time we visited was Monday following NASCAR weekend and waited a good 45 minutes for our food, after waiting 20 minutes to order. Food was still good, but just not enough staff to cover the crowd.  The staff has always been friendly and courteous, no complaints there, just not enough of them.  Is this a result of opening a second location?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the 80's when I was a kid. I live 50 miles away and make the drive to Goodyear because I love the food so much. Their enchiladas, rice and beans is my favorite! Chips and Salsa are amazing too. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Quick service on a busy Mothers Day.  Great food!  Relaxing atmosphere. The staff was nice and personal."}
{"text":"This place was suggested by some friends and one of us had eaten there before. The place was hot and uncomfortable. Service was slow and our server could hardly speak English therefore she got one of our orders wrong. Food was okay but I'd never go back."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place as I had relatives tell me it was good place for Mexican food. NOT. The food was bland. No seasoning and red chili had no spice to it. It's as though they used powder red chili and water...No thanks.  I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Had never been here came for breakfast with my cousin. A little more pricey than other spots for breakfast but it was good. Staff friendly... I'd go back"}
{"text":"I tried this place when I went out to AZ and their carne asada burritos are to die for!! All meat not like your typical Mexican place that does beans and rice and little meat! You will not be unsatisfied plus their customer service was amazing very friendly."}
