{"text":"A very impressive meat shop/butcher.  All the usual expected fare plus more German/European specialities.  The extra sundries are basic but varied and cover the major points.

The various sausages I have tried have all been tasty and well made.  The cuts of meat purchased have been lean but still juicy when cooked and don't leave a huge pool of water in the pan like supermarket cuts.

Highly recommend a trip here.  Especially if you have a freezer as they offer freezer packs as well.  The first few times here or if you only visit occasionally will mean you will possibly be leaving with an armload of meat so plan ahead. :)"}
{"text":"great products and quality and great family business!!!! Bravo to Ken , Dana and family for 30 something years of great service.. Keep up the great work! I would highly recommend this shop.. especially the peperoni and sausages.. Ken is a master!"}
{"text":"DEAR MEN. How do you know when you've grown up? When you're mid conversation with a pretty girl (age approx. 19-22) nursing a cranberry vodka and giving you MAD attitude over your socks and sandals combo. Obviously this girl isn't MOM-approved so you haughtily exit the conversation with \"EXSQUEEZE ME, these crocs were courtesy of Winners. Buzz off, I have a mortgage. Talk to me when your net worth isn't in the red.\"

Bro, way to bail on that drink you (may/may not) have promised her. Because a MAN has to stick to a budget. And for all my FISCALLY responsible brothers out there, this review is for you. You deserve your share of this world's protein for a great price.

And Illichmanns is where you get it.

I almost walked by this shop because it looked like a grim motorcycle shop on the outside. Only the tiny sign that said \"sausages\" caught my eye and I decided to walk in.

Illichmanns' aisles are filled with european fares. Sauerkraut to mustard, they have enough to fill that recipe list you have for your special German/Austrian dinner party.

But my focus was strictly on picking up meat. After all I am doing my weekly food shopping and have to space out my meals for the week. Now I'm not good with gauging things by weight. I've often been used to buying spolumbos by half pound and having my $20 budget on meat eaten up by 4-5 links of sausages. The best I could do was my compartmentalized trips to Costco to score wholesale meats, but there weren't nearly as good as your deli/butcher style sources and are often packed with preservatives.
When I asked for half a kilo I was worried I would be only getting a small amount. WRONG! I got enough meat the size of half my forearm. I was happy, oh boy I was happy.

Their chorizos are amazing. These meaty links are wonderfully spiced and a great freezer meat staple. I've already used up the kilo of chorizo's (all under $15) to kick up meals for myself and guests. Nothing wins over a room like pizza chorizo. PIZZA RIZO!

I can't wait to try their Bavarian sausages. I might just even cook this for a very special person...MYSELF.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to sort my penny and dime jar and count the hairs on my chest.


A kilo of meat for anything under $15 deserves it's fives stars."}
{"text":"I ordered a whole bunch of dried sausages, bratwurst, sliced deli meat, and German chocolates. Everything was of high quality and great taste. Expect to pay half of what you would at any other deli in Calgary in the NW. Organic FRESH turkeys at Christmas (cheap too) and some really stellar vanilla custard cake. This is truly a gem. I don't think I can shop in the NW now that I know what's in the NE."}
{"text":"Went there today bought smoked rib ends and sides cooked on a slow moist heat for 3 hours could not cut chew or eat sell as dog bones not human food l thought this was a good meat shop until they sold me this carp! Hope the bacon l bought is better.the  liverwurst I bought there today had bone or crunchy shit in it!!!! My be done with them!"}
{"text":"Like Ken S. says when you open the door to enter Illichmanns, the smell of smoked meats and sausage says welcome to a special place. Their smoked European sausages, bacon and meat products like pork chops are delicious, as are the cheeses the have. For what you are getting they are reasonably priced too. The have some fresh  baked dinner rolls and European (German, etc) can goods. A couple of my favourites is their peperoni, which is not to dry and has just the right amount of spices, Hungarian and the garlic coil. Their speciality is sausages, but they really are a complete butcher shop that offers good service, excellent quality and decent prices."}
{"text":"This is a hard name to forget.  I'd seen the name several times in local city magazines/papers, but never dropped by to check it out or sample the goods.  Until a culinary treasure hunt brought us here.  I was so excited to finely get to explore this sausage shop.  During our task we even got to sample the pepperoni (YUM).  Imagine tempting us with food as a way to get us to return.  Brilliant.

I can honestly say we've been back a couple of times since our first October encounter.  Always seems to be someone different working behind the counter (I try to remember faces/names) but nonetheless the sausage/meats/deli items & European chocolates are fabulous.  While there are numerous other offerings in the store to tempt you, we haven't made it past the deli counter yet.  One mustn't rush things.

Since I love to eat & prepare charcuterie, I predict many future visits over to International Avenue and Illichmann's Sausage Shop."}
{"text":"As a guy who grew up in Wpg and has \"sky\" at the end of his name, I consider myself a bit of an expert in smoked meats and sausage. I stopped here last week to load up on a variety of products but have been disappointed with everything I've tried so far. The Ukrainian sausage is too fatty and the other dried sausage I tried was greasy and flavorless. I guess my hunt for good garlic sausage in Calgary continues."}
{"text":"I'm sad to report that over the past 3 months Illichman's has taken a turn for the worse.

I've still been going fairly regularly but there's been a change.  I think they're under new ownership as the products have changed and there's a definite change of staff.  The frumpy old German ladies (who were VERY friendly) are gone and replaced by a younger (but \"I don't give a damn) crowed.  

Sad"}
