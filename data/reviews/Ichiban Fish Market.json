{"text":"Ichiban is a good place to go for take-out sushi, the fish is fresh and your sushi order is prepared right in front of you while you wait by courteous and professional staff.  If you like to grill salmon on the bbq, might I suggest getting some of the sushi grade salmon cut into fillets and then marinade them in teryaki sauce before grilling, my brother did this once, it was delisch."}
{"text":"We get takeout here regularly. The spider roll is fantastic and so is the Boston roll which is salmon and avocado. The salmon sashimi is also great and fresh. You can buy it by the pound.  The dining area is a bit sad. There are only a few tables and I have yet to see any dine in customers. I guess most people just get take out."}
{"text":"This is my first restaurant review ever, this alone should tell you how amazing this sushi restaurant is! When you're in love, you want to tell the world! This is not the same restaurant as Ichiban Fish Market, this is a new restaurant under new management and chef called Sushi Ichiban (Ellesmere) now. Anyways let's start from the top: 1. (DECOR): Newly renovated, small but spacious, great lighting, great interior design and eye appealing colours. 5/5! 2. (SERVICE): EXCELLENT SERVICE! The lady (who I'm assuming is the head chef's wife) is so amazingly nice, caring and quick. Never once had I had to put my hands up for anything, it's like she has perfect timing. Her English is not her mother tongue and she has an accent but she can communicate very well and has a very genuine smile. She makes us feel very welcomed, like it doesn't feel routine or fake at all, I feel more like a guest at somebody's house than a customer. 5/5! 3. (FOOD): Now here's the most important part. I ordered the 68 piece Sushi, Sashimi & Roll combo. This is probably the best tasting sushi I've ever had. Each sushi was amazing. Let's start with the ROLLS first. The rice on the rolls are not excessive, unlike those AYCE sushi with a tiny bit of fish on the inside and a bunch of rice (most of the time horribly cooked rice) on the outside. Not here. The rice had such a pleasant texture, it was cooked with definite care. Aside from the fish, there was an assortment of condiments and vegetables that were so good, I didn't even use soy sauce. Next is the NIGIRI SUSHI & SASHIMI. Again, I need to complement the damn rice. It was sticky enough to maintain its firmness but not clumped together, you can see the space between each grain. I can even feel the texture of the rice on my tongue! The fish itself is so fresh and pretty thick as well. The sashimi were thick slices. I don't know what else to say....the fish was FRESH and the salmon belly MELTS in your mouth. It also came with roe which are very expensive. And also, I don't know how the chef did it, but I HATE squid and octopus, however he somehow cut it and prepared it so well that those two were my favourites (yes over the lean toro and salmon belly!!). I asked if they had the o-toro (fatty tuna) but they didn't since it is seasonal. The WASABI was legit. I've been to sushi restaurants where I had to put quite a bit of wasabi to get the kick. BIG MISTAKE! I took the amount that I would take from other restaurants here, and I sobbed for a good 15-20s. Their wasabi is THAT good. Also the miso soup we had in the beginning didn't not taste powdery at all. It was boiling hot and had a fish stock taste to it, which to me means they probably made it but I could be wrong. Honestly, after finding out that their wasabi was that strong and the texture of the rice that good, I knew I found my sushi spot. Even the small tangerine they served at the end of the meal that comes with the bill was SO sweet!! Like honestly the attention to detail is incredible! But what do you expect from a master chef who was once the chef of a restaurant in a 5 star hotel? And you know how much it was for all of this? $64 before tax + tip! I forgot I had cash so I got my girlfriend to pay debit, but upon finding my cash I decided that we would pay cash to help them out. It was so so so worth it. The master chef AKA sushi chef has a great sense of humour as well. I told him I loved his rice and wasabi and he replies \"but what about me!?\" I am definitely going back, I'm actually worried about writing this review because I don't want people taking up the space. Oh the food, 5/5! The value.....priceless. I am a fricken happy customer. I am a ramen and sushi connoisseur and finally, I've found an amazing sushi restaurant at a crazy good value!! Their website may look sketch, but trust me, the restaurant itself is the complete opposite. It may sound like I'm getting paid to write this or something, I might as well have been considering the quality of the food they gave me.....money can't buy (well, it can but you get the point!). So definitely check them out, I uploaded the salmon belly photo and the sushi boat, the quality is pretty shit considering I didn't have the patience to adjust the settings cause I want to eat it quickly but trust me the quality of the fish, rice, wasabi, soup, customer service, and most importantly PRICE, you'll definitely go back again!!"}
