{"text":"pretty cool truck - simple smoked meat and homemade biscuits.  briney pickle and mac n cheese were great compliments to the tender and flavorful brisket. homemade strawberry jam was delicious. would visit again."}
{"text":"Really expensive and small portions.  Had the combo which was $14 or $15 which was two sliders a side and a pickle.  The sliders were two half dollar sized biscuits cut in half with brisket on top.  The briscket was cubed instead of sliced and not smoky, seemed more like a roast to me.  The sauce was not bad, but seemed to be needed to cover up the brisket.  I did half and half on the side and got the beans and Mac.  The beans were good, and the mac was not bad either.  It might have been OK if I had paid $7 but I still would not buy again even at that price.  For the price I paid, I feel I got ripped off.  I could get a full two item combo at Smoky Bones for the same price and it would be better"}
{"text":"I tried their food truck at the Millvale Food Truck Park and was overall happy with everything. The brisket was really great. I'm not sure if I loved the pairing with the biscuits though."}
{"text":"This Food truck came to our place of work,  Went out to try it and see how it was.  The combo that they advertise is 14 bucks for 2 sliders a side and a pickle.  Seemed a little expensive.  So i went with the better priced brisket mac and cheese for 7 dollars.  My colleague got the combo for 14 dollars.  when we got the food, the portions were incredibly small.  the brisket mac and cheese was served in a hot dog boat.  i was expecting a little more for the price of 7 dollars.  Honestly, if i knew that the portions were so small, i would never have bought it.  You should try competing with your competitors.  The Oakmont BBQ truck that comes up here gives you a good helping of mac and cheese with brisket for a better price.  I will not buy from this food truck again."}
{"text":"Brisket N Biscuit.  Good stuff.  Had the chance to get lunch from Brisketburgh food truck.  The menu has brisket, fresh homemade biscuits, homemade jelly/compote, mac & cheese and thats about it.  But the brisket is so good.  The biscuits are good too.  And a PGH pickle came with.  He had two sauces.  A regular that had a little kick and a sweet that was to sweet for me. Would love to try the Mac & cheese with brisket--next time.  Only one person working the truck so it did take a little bit since there was a line."}
