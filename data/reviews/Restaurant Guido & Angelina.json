{"text":"Spent the MLK day weekend in Montreal.  Worst idea ever.  Montreal is a great city....in the summer time.  It must have been 0 or possibly negative degrees the entire long weekend.  We ended up ducking into bars and restaurants just to get out of the cold.  After a bit of walking around St. Catherine, we spotted Les 3 Brasseurs.  Looked like a decent place, but it was packed to the gills.  No luck there, not even at the bar.  Decided to stop in the next available place.  Enter Guido & Angelina.

This questionably named restaurant seems like your average, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It was pretty empty, which normally would have been enough for me to look elsewhere, but it was cold and I was hungry.  Despite being pretty empty, they had at least 5 employees gathered at the corner of the bar looking at a laptop.  One of them noticed us standing by the hostess table after a few minutes and walked over.  She had a half beleaguered, half confused look on her face, as if we had come to the front door of her home, looking to get seated.  To the hostess: I apologize for pulling you away from your group facebook/youtube/shopping session.  We exchanged a few uncomfortable pleasantries found our way to the bar.  The menu was pretty expansive, but with typical Italian fair.  Nothing exotic, but all the classics were represented.  I decided to get the bruschetta and crab cakes for our appetizer.  After ordering, we were pleasantly surprised that the food was prepared on the fast side.  I guess that is to be expected, considering there were maybe three other tables of people in the place.  Unfortunately, the speedy preparation of the food did not compensate for the total lack of flavor and authenticity.  The bruschetta was covered in a tomato salsa type topping with absolutely no seasoning.  It tasted like raw tomatoes on toast.   The crab cakes were a little undercooked, being somewhat gooey on the inside.  They too lacked any discernable flavor outside of the bland breading on the outside.  If I had my eyes closed, I would have guessed them to be fried oatmeal balls.  These oatmeal balls were accompanying by a \"salad\", the likes of which could only be described as rediscovered scraps that had spent time on the floor behind the refrigerator.  The vegetables were dried out and dirty.  We each had a taste of both dishes, but left good portions of each on the plate.  I really should have stopped right there, but the prospect of heading back out into the frozen tundra of downtown Montréal to find a new place to eat was the deciding factor to tuff it out.  Being as cold as it was, I was thinking heavy, rich food to warm me up.  I noticed they were serving carbonara.  That seems like something basic enough that it would be passable anywhere.   I was wrong.  First and most importantly, the noodles were the worst noodles I've ever had.  I'm no aficionado about pasta, but I do care a great deal about how it is cooked.  They served the carbonara with spaghetti that was unusually white in color.  It was either really overcooked or was of such low quality that it lacked both texture and any wheat flavor.  It reminded me of Vietnamese rice sticks, which are great for their application, but shouldn't ever touch Italian sauces.  The sauce was cream based, and as far as I could tell, did not have any egg in it.  It lacked cohesion with the rest of the ingredients, where one bite I'd get a raw garlic taste, another I would get a raw parsley taste--all within a very soupy, bland sauce.  It was almost as if someone microwaved cream with pancetta, garlic, parsley, and pepper in a bowl and poured it over the pasta.  This was not carbonara.  I struggled through about a quarter of the dish, repeating in my mind that I didn't in fact order carbonara--that this was a Canadian dish that I've never had before.  It got me through enough to not feel starving anymore.  

On the plus side, the bar tender who was serving us was very pleasant, albeit a little distracted with restocking.  She mixed quite a few drinks for us."}
{"text":"Pas mauvais mais ça ressemble plus à de la nourriture de Fast-Food de luxe à un prix trop élevé."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place with family during my trip to Montreal. The menu was looking good and it was totally packed inside. The more people you see inside means it's a good place, right? Wrong!

We were seated by a kind server who took forever to come back just to get our drink orders. The drinks arrived, and the server disappeared again for a long time. Finally, our orders were taken and the food took forever to come, and when they dishes were presented to us, they were slapped on the table and off went the server into a far away land. 

I didn't like my food at all, nor did anyone else at the table. It was bland and boring, also pretty expensive for the poor quality you received and the dinky portions. I ordered a risotto which was bland and small and cost around $20!

I'm going to avoid this place during my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"The food was below average. It was mediocre Italian food and the portions were fairly small for their price. 

The service was awful, water was not refilled nor was our waiter around when we needed the bill. I barely saw our waiter, I had to ask another waiter for out bill. A nearby table had a basket of bread, we however never saw one at our table. The service was inattentive.

When the food came it was rancid, stale, and possibly old. My girlfriends fish didn't seem fresh and it was undercooked. She also got very little fish in her seafood linguine, for what the plate cost, this was infuriating. The food was overpriced, especially since it was mediocre, rancid, and inedible. It was also impossible to complain, because our waiter never came by to see how our meal was. 

Neither of us finished our meal because we couldn't digest half of it, nor did we have the desire to.

I would not recommend this restaurant to others, not unless you enjoy mediocre, raw, rancid, small portioned, and expensive Italian food, with pathetic service and a poorly lighted restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant italien classique avec un choix intéressant de plats et des portions généreuses. Très populaire sur l'heure du lunch, alors le service laisse parfois à désirer, mais c'est une conséquence normale de ce succès. J'y retournerais plus souvent s'ils avaient plus de serveurs ou si j'avais une heure et demie de lunch. Je devrais peut-être demander à ma patronne."}
{"text":"Straight and to the point--- nice atmosphere, large portions, and we liked what we ordered, there was lots of flavour and good bread. It wasn't anything to write home about, but we didn't leave disappointed and that matters a lot when you're travelling (I would learn this lesson later at another restaurant). We would go back."}
{"text":"We dined here for dinner during our June 2010 vacation in Montreal and had and wonderful experince. We happened upon this restaurant which was located close to our hotel. The food was excellent and the service was kind and attentive. The stars of this menu were the fresh homemade pasta dishes. I had \"THE BEST\" pasta dish I've ever enjoyed which was their Fresh Fettucini with Smoked Salmon. It was divine. 
I could've probably inhaled 3 more plates of this just thinking back on it now. I seriuosly had seperation anxiety for the next few days thinking back to this dish. My mom had the Mushroom Risotto which she loved. They made a  little Alfredo Penne Pasta dish for my daughter and my wife enjoyed their Chicken Parmigana dish with Spaghetti. (I think she's the only one who ever orders this ) :) They also provide fresh warm baked bread with Olive Oil that my wife, daughter and mother devoured. 
I felt he prices were very reasonable and the portions were generous.
Overall we had a great experiance here and I would definitely return again if only to re-order that Fettucini with Smoked Salmon."}
{"text":"In Montreal for the All-Star Game cuz there are just some things you have to do before you die. We found this place close to the Hotel, and when it's 13 degrees outside, we're not that picky! This place was pretty good, but I wouldn't go if you're in a hurry. The service was, let's just say relaxed. The food was good, and the big screen TV's were fun, but the desert was outstanding. So if you're in the mood for descent Italian, and not in a hurry, or it's late, your freezing, and you feel your stomach eating itself, this place will be right up your alley."}
{"text":"head of the waiters very rude and not welcome the presence of little children and also reserving we were not offered a suitable table to sit down with strollers close, poor quality compared to a real Italian pizzeria. 
Perhaps.........before calling it ESPRESSO ITALIANO would be advised to try one true.

not enough to give the name to the Italian food to make an Italian restaurant, and an Italian restaurant should be welcoming, sorry but they must improve to afford the Italian taste. 

positive note, our waiter was very kind."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful if you enjoy microwaved dishes. It's not even worthy a review."}
{"text":"Exact Change...

OK so I'm hungry and so is my friend, we just pick this moderately priced pasta place in Montreal. The restaurant seems a bit empty but we go in any way and get seated then the waiter brings us bread. The bread is not baked all the way through it is a bit stretchy so it is not cooked all the way through, however it is warm. 

Then we proceed to oder some pasta as we are hungry the waiter comes over takes our oder. Ten or so minutes later the pasta arrives in a big bowl and the portion is generous. I got some garlic pasta and chicken and mushrooms, Seriously how much garlic do you need to put in a dish, if i wanted to eat garlic ill just eat the whole clove.

My friend got the pasta and meat sauce, that was good the meat sauce was kinda of fresh. When the waitress asked do we want any cheese i said no my friend said yes. She just took a scoop of cheese and through it on his plate in a lump, i was like ok WT*.

We didnt finish our plates so we just go it to go, which is no big deal she put it in some aluminum dishes and gave it to us. 

Then she brings the bill, and after she brings it she is like do you want one or two check?, normal question but it be better if you asked BEFORE you bring the check.

Then we pay and give some tip, instead of taken the money and going back to her counter place or something and counting it there. She stood right at the table and started to count the change and the money right in front of us. Me and my friend looked at each other like WT* is up with that.

Ok lets say we wanted change or we wanted to just get up and leave we could not b/c she was standing at the table and counting our change right tin front of our eyes. How embarrassing would it be if we didn't have enough or we just gave a minimum tip, which we didn't.

Seriously i was going to give this place at least like 2 or 3 stars but the waitress, ruined it and i if i could give negative ten stars i would seriously, no manners on the waitresses part.

Never ever in my life I'm going back there, SO RUDE."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special.  It was good.  The bread was good and warm.

The portions are huge (at least for lunch) because you get soup or salad, bread, and a huge plate of your entree.

The location is huge."}
{"text":"Hey! for Canada....well done!  sure beats the olive garden by a long shot."}
{"text":"Simply terrible nothing else to say"}
{"text":"Horrible place for food.  Just terrible.

Awesome location.  Good service.  Great for groups."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on same day here. The food was good very good. We spent about $30 per person with drinks and just ordering the main dishes. Pasta runs $10-15 and meats average $20-25. Appetizers run $8-12. The plates are very big. I recommend the pasta with clams, very well made! Service was okay."}
{"text":"Bien situé sur la rue Sainte-Catherine, le restaurant à un beau décor et une belle ouverture à l'avant qui permet de profiter de l'air d'été. Cependant, je n'ai pas trouvé mon expérience très agréable. Il faut dire que si vous y aller durant l'heure du dîner, attendez-vous à ce que l'endroit soir plein. Coté nourriture, l'entré de boulette de crabe manquait d'assaisonnement, les pâtes au saumon fumé manquait de saumons fumé et le plat de moules frite aurait été mieux si les frites avaient été faite avec des patates classique et non des patates sucrées. Il ont également un forfait spécial avec le cinéma banque scotia : avis à ceux qui cherche une idée de soirée en amoureux."}
{"text":"Update - The restaurant is closed as the windows are covered with orange plastic wrap. 

I have been told (rumor) that the space will either be converted to a food court, or that a Jack Astor's is moving in."}
{"text":"Today's lunch special (pasta de la jour, pizze de la jour) are good. Staff is friendly. Good choice!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here so I could get dinner and he could have something to nibble on for dessert since he already had eaten dinner. I had wanted to come here for a while and didn't expect that I'd slip in tonight because I couldn't think of anywhere else to eat that wasn't fast food. There were not very many people in the place but it was well staffed. i splurged and decided to order the linguine with seafood which is what I usually order when going out for Italian food. It was good, but not quite as tasty as I've had it in other restaurants. Therefore, I felt that 24 dollars was a little steep for what it was. For a well-staffed eatery, service was slow and inattentive. It took a very long time for our waiter to come and take our order and it was difficult to catch his eye when we needed something. I suppose they were tired after a long day of work and were preparing to close for the night. I will come back, but hopefully things will be a little more lively."}
{"text":"I used to visit Montreal several times a year and always looked forward to my G&A's visit. I've never had a service problem at G&A's whether in a couple or larger group service was always prompt with refills and just generally attentive. Very nice ambiance and reasonable prices. Veal stuffed tortellini is what keeps me coming back. I've had other things on the menu but the tortellini just hits home. In the end I've never left G&A's unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food for supper this evening so walked to Guido & Angelina.

It was fairly quiet when I got there about 6:15ish.

I sat at a table by the window ... a great spot for people watching.  Alas, there were lots of smokers walking by, both cigarettes and the illegal kind.

My red wine was good.

Megan was my server and took good care of me.

She brought me some bread.  It was really hard and crusty on the outside and I just had a small piece.

I ordered lasagna.  It was made with fresh pasta and the portion was B-I-G.  Though it didn't say in the description, I think there was a lot of parm cheese in it ... and I hate parm cheese.  It would have been so much better without it.

When I left about 7:30ish, the restaurant was fairly crowded."}
{"text":"I don't tend to give too many 5 on 5's, so really it's a 4 plus. The only things that brought it down, were our plates being taken away too quickly or left too long once finished - minor, but still relevant. The other slight take away, was that my dish was a little overly rich/salty (I believe the black rice was doused in butter or the like and capers are pretty much a salt substitute). Overall the dish (filet of trout over black rice and green beans) was delish. Maybe it's a good thing that it was rich and filling, because I took a portion home for a next day reprise. We shared a Bruschetta starter, which was above the average. The special menu included a cherry tomato and three (bell) pepper salad, and there ended the healthy portion of the meal. A serious slab of Lasagna was also enjoyed and barely finished, due to being pretty stuffed or just wanting to cram a pretty decent Cannoli and Maple cake into our happy gullets. Now I know why mint tea is known as a digestion aid. Despite the cutesy name, this place doles out a satisfying \"yet non - mom and pop\" Italian dinner. PS It's 'tres' date friendly."}
{"text":"One of those places on St. Catherine where you go when you don't know where else to go. Convenient when you just finished shopping with friends and you guys just want a place to rest your legs and a meal. It's never full so seating is quick and immediate. The food is decent enough for the price and the portions can fill two small stomachs. (especially if you munch on the bread)"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner when we were visiting Montreal. We didn't know much about the place so we took a chance. It was great!

The food here was delicious and cooked very well. I had the wood oven pizza and it was delicious. The staff was friendly. We explained to our waiter that we did not speak french and he was so kind that he tried his best to explain all the dishes to us in english. We didn't feel any sort of discrimination from the restaurant staff at all. Our order was taken in a timely manner and our food arrived faster than we expected. It was a saturday night and the restaurant was busy but the staff there worked in great time."}
{"text":"DW was desperate to go to a Canadian Wal-Mart so we take the car out of the parking Garage (first mistake), drive nearly an hour through traffic only to find out that Wal-Mart apparently closes sometime before 8:15PM on a Sat. night.  While we're out in the burbs we thought we'd find a place to grab some dinner (second mistake).  After driving around for nearly two hours we end up a block from our hotel nearly 10pm at night @ Guido and Angelina's.  

It was nice and quiet and we were seated quickly.  I had the Penne Romanoff (kinda like Penne in Vodka Sauce) and DW had Tortellini gigi al cardinale (meat tortellini in rose sauce).  The bread was really good, fresh and warm.  The service was super fast, almost too fast as if the food was already prepared and just warmed in the oven.  This is why I took a star off.  Otherwise we were extremely happy with our meal and only wish we had saved ourselves the time of driving aimlessly around Montreal for no apparent reason."}
{"text":"Average.  Just average.  Not bad, not good.

Family friendly.  Right across from major shopping."}
