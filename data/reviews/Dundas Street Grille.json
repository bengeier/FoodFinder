{"text":"We ate there twice, once for Dinner and other for Breakfast. Breakfast was much better then dinner. 
For dinner we had two entree: open face Hot Hamburger and Chicken Parmesan there were average nothing special, taste was average. I may give dinner another try."}
{"text":"Our family has been frequenting Dundas Street Grill for years. It is our go to spot when we haven't made plans for dinner and are just looking for a great meal. There daily specials are usually quite good and the selection is awesome. Whether you want pasta, a burger, fish or steak they have it all. The service is good and prices very reasonable. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place because the parking lot is usually full and I live near by. My family and I finally tried this place today for dinner and we will probably never go back...maybe for breakfast just based on other reviews. 

First of all, my family and I were seated at the very back of the restaurant, while everyone else was sat in the main area. I am not sure why...maybe it's because we have tattoos? Maybe it's because my partner is brown? I don't even know.  

The food was okay and the staff were actually quite friendly. Overall...it was meh."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this place and I  was disappointed. We had high hopes considering the constant crowds. Even though we were lined up out the door, it moved rather quickly. Food was mediocre and my daughters pancakes were not properly cooked. I put the uncooked pancake on a side plate for the server to take, instead  she dumped it back onto my daughters plate and took everything away. Leaving  my 5 yr old with nothing to eat. When she returned with my daughters meal the pancakes were horribly over cooked & by that point my daughter wasn't even hungry because she had been snacking on our meals. I had an omelet (bacon & feta) It was like they scrambled my omelet (so instead of being filled with bacon, the bacon was cooked into the egg). And I think the icing on the cake was when our waitress dropped some dirty cups with half drank water and juice on my lap.  After this negative experience we weren't even comped a meal or given a discount. Very disappointing, will not be back."}
{"text":"These guys have the best eggs Benedict in the GTA! The staff here are super sweet, and the hostess is always extremely nice."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast. My potatoes had a fishy taste to them. Everything else was standard fare, but that was enough to turn me off from visiting it again."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck! Simple classic greasy spoon style breakfast with your basic goods. Would come back for a simple breakfast but wouldnt be my top 5. I prefer more \"adventurous\" options, but thats my taste."}
{"text":"Don't order the classic club. What a rip off. It was more like a tomato sandwich! I sent it back. I felt I was getting ripped off... The waitress tried to convince me it was okay by showing me the menu again but I pointed out that the first ingredient listed is turkey not tomato and I will not be paying for this. Defiantly not coming back to a place that can't even make a sandwich."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, home-cooked meals, nice portions, fast service. . . you never leave hungry!

Some of my faves:

Great Grizzly Burger
Chicken Burger
BBQ Chicken Caesar
Greek Salad
All-day breakfast

And if you're lucky, you'll go on a day when they bring in the coveted Caramel Crunch Cake.  

Only negative . . . the gravy is way too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this place and the food is ok. I had a chicken wrap with a side and my husband had a breakfast plate. The portions aren't huge which can be a good thing but for me I was still hungry after. It was typical diner prices but for what you get, it ain't worth it. I rather go to sunset grill or Tim hortons for better food and prices"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and I found this place to be really good! Good service, good food and prices are reasonable. Has line ups on a weekend morning, but line moved fairly quickly."}
{"text":"We were at the restaurant this past Saturday.  I ordered a toasted tuna on white, since I was told no rye bread on the weekends.  There must be great logic in that decision.  The sandwich came on a small side dish, bare naked.  A sprig of parsley?  1/4 dill pickle maybe?  Guess not.  While we were there my iPhone kept asking to join their Wifi.  So I asked our waitress what the password was for their network.  I was told it was for internal use ONLY.  Like scuse me.  Do you think they could SPLURGE on their customers to use their system?  They seem to be doing well enough that they could do the honours."}
{"text":"The food was nothing to write home about; just standard breakfast fare. However, I would have preferred if my water glass was clean. Finding little bits of stuff floating in the glass and stuck to the side is a total turnoff."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my eggs Florentine and the prompt service. It's a popular spot and brunch is their specialty, with a pleasant family atmosphere. My only criticism is that they really should have non-dairy creamers for those of us that are lactose-intolerant.

I'm sure their coffee was great but I didn't try it because the milk and cream would have wreaked havoc in my stomach. Our server's response was that they're a family restaurant. Get with the times. People have allergies, and so do families!

Aside from that I would go back with my friends if they suggest it. I'll just bring my milk-alternative next time."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for so many years. It is not a fancy place but definitely consistent good quality and cleanliness. It's a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great value for money. Friendly staff and many have worked there for years so that says something positive about the owners too. The open concept can get a little noisy at times when it's busy but all in all a great place for a variety of staple go to foods (Canadian and some European simple dishes)."}
{"text":"Love going to Dundas Street Grille with a friend or family for the weekend brunch.  I always get \"The Breakfast\" which comes with 3 eggs, toast, bacon or sausage and hash browns.  It's affordable and closeby, which is why it's my neighbourhood gem.

Their omelettes are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Every now and then,I gotta visit Dundas street grille for breakfast, it just became a habit. Going tomorrow morning. Line up on weekends, but you'll get a seat fast."}
{"text":"By far my favourite breakfast place in the city. The food is delicious, the prices are low, and the staff are super friendly! Make sure to start with a soup of the day for under $3."}
{"text":"A great place to come for breakfast/brunch on weekends if you don't mind waiting in line sometimes. Lunch and dinner food is good too, but not quite the same value as the breakfast."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I go about once a week for breakfast. As others have noted, the lineups can get long on weekends. Decent food at a good price, and always excellent service, friendly and efficient. I always get an omelette and my man gets the French toast. Tasty and I'm full for hours after."}
{"text":"Great food variety and really delicious. Staff is always welcoming and so nice! I definitely suggest you give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Alright folks its time to write again, I had this place on my radar for while, so one morning I was in the area, and decided to stop by, I had a fantastic experience, my server name was Cathy I believe who was very helpful and made tons of reco's.

I always appreciate when the server likes the food they serve and are passionate about the food that they are serving. She highly recommended the peameal Bacon (cornmeal bacon) so I ordered it, and it was pretty decent 

Overall: I would definitely go back just because the service was so good and the food was decent as well...

Keep on Yelpin ****"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch one afternoon and was delighted by a wonderful omelette and friendly staff. Family atmosphere, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Dundas Street Grille is a busy place for brunch with your typical breakfast food. Their bacon is cooked just right and the french toast are offered in generous portions. Overall a good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Came into the Dundas Street Grille on a Sunday afternoon and expected it to be busy and maybe even have to wait for a table. It was quite busy, but we were seated in under 2 minutes. Fantastic. We knew we wanted the breakfast so we were quick to order and the food came fast... bing bang boom. Hot and ready. The waitress was great too. She came around twice to fill up my hubby's coffee and made sure we had everything we needed. 
We'll come again."}
{"text":"Always consistent with food quality and service!  A go to breakfast place!  Eggs Benny a must have!  The breakFeast is excellent!  We love it!  Kids love it.  Comfortable surroundings!  Been going for over 10 yrs!  You will never be disappointed!  Even if the line up looks long u will get in in ten minutes!"}
{"text":"I always go there food is Really good service is fast and very very friendly. Love this place is one Of my favourite"}
{"text":"This is another staple in the six points area.  In fact the place gets so busy on Sundays for breakfast you may have to park at six points plaza.

This place can get really busy on the weekends for breakfast.  The line ups sometimes go out to the double doors and outside at times.  

The breakfast is just ok.  It's a diner type place so there is a variety of egg styles, pancakes, fruit, oatmeal, sandwiches etc.  I think the appeal of this place is that the prices are still after all these years very reasonable and it's a good all around family restaurant.

As busy as the place is the service is very attentive and the service is usually pretty quick as well.  

I think the best value is \"the breakfast\" which is eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, potatoes and a coffee.  I think it's still around 8 bucks?  

Basically it's another Etobicoke staple that has been around for decades and deservingly so."}
{"text":"Easily our GOTO location for FAST, and good food. Most times the staff is good to great, No matter how full the parking lot a table is available quickly. The caesar salad is crisp. About the only downside, as a matter of taste is that the french fries are the standard julien type cut fries as compared to the real potato of homemade fries (makes a difference with Fish & chips). Portion size is decent, and at dinner you may have to request the bread (usually free with meal). We keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I go for breakfast here at least once a week when I'm in town the staff is consistent the food is consistent clean organized great spot if you're in Toronto"}
{"text":"If you want Sunday Brunch then get here early.  Parking is right but there is a Tim's across the road."}
{"text":"This place is your standard Grill/diner place. The place has a very nice layout with some oversized booths.  Lots of seating. Clean.  
The food is pretty much what you would expect for a diner / comfort food type of place.  The majority of the crowd that comes here is a lot of repeat clients who are elder.  You can tell this as the staff really do know and care about their clients.  The staff is also very accommodating to any special requests to their meals.  It's a nice atmosphere.  This is actually our go to place when we go out with my boyfriend's parents.  I've been here several times.  It's also a great atmosphere if you have a large family with kids."}
{"text":"This place is so cute.. Been going here since I was a kid going with my mom and grandma.  

Though she has passed away years ago,  I still continue to go with my boyfriend or mom because they offer the best milk shakes, 'Hot Hamburger' (what my grandma used to order all the time), and all day breakfast combo that is the only thing I ever want to eat along with my milkshake and coffee."}
{"text":"Before embarking on our trip back south of the border, we came in and it was packed on a Sunday morning, great service, wonderful breakfast food and huge servings, nonstop coffee, what more can you ask for before an 8.5 hour drive?"}
{"text":"Great place to bring picky eaters because they have very wide array of options.

In addition to the menu options the quality, service, and pricing is great."}
{"text":"Always an easy, quick bite. I prefer to come here for breakfast, served before noon. They have a great selection, great service and there's never a long wait (for food or a table). Diner-style atmosphere and the price is always right!"}
{"text":"Great staff! Fast service. Good basic food. Cheap. 2 can dine under $20. 
I've lived in the area for 5 years and found this to be the cheapest, fastest and friendliest spots.  
For the friendliest service I found the upstairs section best on Saturdays.  However keep in mind it can get really loud with the servers putting the old dishes in the dish tray.  So see if you can go near the window. If you like sitting in a sunny spot, the booths along the window are great.  
The quietest spot is at the back near the booths, two person space.  
I went there on a first date it was person for listening and privacy."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place. Amazing service!! Our server was always around refilling our coffees and bringing more milk. I greatly appreciated that. 
Well priced for an abundance of hardy good food. I'll definitely be going back and recommending this very friendly place to others :)"}
{"text":"We go here about once every month or two for breakfast on the weekend.  The breakfasts are good and reasonably priced.

I'm a fan of the \"breakfast for two\", which includes pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, and ham, coffee too (I think), all for under $15.

There is often a line-up on weekend mornings.

Service is generally pretty good, though it depends on the server and how busy they are."}
{"text":"Our server was great.  She was always around for refills. Food came out very quickly. Food was a bit too salty but still very enjoyable. A very busy spot on Dundas!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend to have dinner,  it was my first time there. The restaurant was clean and the service was very good. They had a good selection on there menu to choose from and the prices where resenabale."}
{"text":"I make my way to Kipling station at least once a month and yet I've somehow never tried the Dundas Street Grille. On this particular trip, however, my dining companion and I figured the time was right to finally check out this Etobicoke staple.

The layout inside is exactly as you might imagine, with the proliferation of comfy booths and old-school waitresses. We perused the surprisingly extensive dinner menu and I eventually settled on the Chopped Beef (\"tender ground beef topped with fried onions in a rich gravy and served with choice of potato\").

And while this will never be mistaken for fine dining, I'll admit I enjoyed the heck out of this dish. The meat is juicy and flavorful, the gravy is absolutely delicious, and the plentiful fried onions are a perfect accompaniment. The included mashed potatoes and peas are fine, too, but it's the meat and gravy and onions that are the star attraction here.

The platter also includes a starting soup or salad, and the Caesar salad I started with was good (but nothing special).

I am definitely excited to return and check out more options on the Dundas Street Grille's impressive menu."}
{"text":"The Dundas Street Grille is, in my opinion, one of the best places for brunch in Etobicoke; it's got that very old school Toronto vibe about it.  Please keep in mind that it is a diner, so don't expect anything too fancy as the décor is a bit dated.

We've never really had an issue getting parking or a table as the service is pretty quick.  The wait staff are so friendly and attentive as well.  One thing we like to order is the Eggs Blackstone - it's basically Eggs Benedict but with swapped with bacon (instead of ham) and rye toast (instead of an english muffin) - so yummy and about $8.00 or so!  My husband likes to always get the french onion soup; it's not bad and, I think, about $3.00 - very good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I wish they did, I wish they might, give us half stars for reviews. 

The DSG is a nice piece of local colour where they serve up a nice selection of breakfasts.  They've got a classic egg n' meat platter, and good omlettes.  It's centrally located for transit and auto, the service is rarely anything less than great, and I've been here a lot of times.  I give it two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Had a fun breakfast this morning with some old friends. Location is great and the food is always steadily good. Not great. Not astounding. Just steady eggy!  Three of us had \"the breakfast\" with various types of eggs and accompanying meats and one was an eggs Benedict. As mentioned all good. Coffee nice and hot and they do come around often to refill. 

This place has been here as long as I can remember (25+ years) and it shows that steady quality, a good location and decent service are a winning combination. With tip we paid $50 for the four of us."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have come here several times as it seems I couldn't avoid it so many people love this place. So I continued to give it a shot out of convenience and i will say i am glad i did because it has now become a place i frequent when looking for some good old fashioned comfort food.

The service, once you become a regular is quite good and watching how they deal with the regular senior crowd is truly heart warming and never fails to leave a smile on my face. I feel comfortable here, never rushed or bothered by other guests like with some other diners. The tables are large, comfortable and clean, i never find myself plopped arm to arm with another table or forced to endure someone else's conversation because we are just in too close a proximity. 

Presentation of the food does vary but keeping in mind this is a family restaurant style diner I do overlook this even so the food is always on par. They have a variety of super affordable daily specials and they even have several ice cream flavors I have yet to try though they do look delish in a small refrigerated glass display case with tubs of yumminess! 

All in all I feel this place has diligently earned this star upgrade and I look forward to venturing back for a delicious old fashioned milkshake and a bite"}
{"text":"Have become a regular here.  Today was not busy for them compared to the usual flow.  Was seated at a booth, immediately checked in on Yelp.  Sat for 10 minutes with no one coming by to get drinks, say someone will be with you shortly, etc.  Nothing.  Grabbed our jackets and menus walked to the front, handed our menus and let them know why we were leaving.  The woman at the register said, I will make sure someone is with you in 5 minutes.  Uh, no thank you."}
{"text":"Good diner.  Surprised by the poor rating.   Clean and friendly.  And if you're under 60 you'll feel young here...."}
{"text":".Great breakfast for a good price what more do u need. Me and ky family have been going there almost every Sunday for decadevand the atmosphere is very conducive to conversation and relacing. The waiting staff is fast and efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the gems in etobicoke for brekky and lunch. They have all day brekky and on weekends extended hours for the full breakfast menu. 

Cheap and good, you can be in and out in 30min. 

Super sandwich LA club is delicious ! They use pumpernickel bread and it works perfectly. $9 with a side. The western style sandwich is not bad, its basically an omelette between two slices of bread (no side though). $6 for a decent sized portion. 

The soup du jour is amazing as my boyfriend would say. Gets it every time for $3.25. The chicken cream is the best soup everrrrrrr. 

Everything about this place is awesome. On weekends its packed but you can get a table in 10min. I would eat everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast here a few times over the last year or two as I live in the area. This place is packed every Sunday and I honestly don't know why. The breakfast is ok. You can get the same breakfast in a million other places. It is nothing special & over priced. I honestly think that people go here for nostalgic reasons. Maybe they grew up in the area as kids or teenagers & this was the only place around at the time for a decent breakfast & now they want to bring their kids, parents & grandparents to relive memories. That is the only reason why I can think of why this place is so popular on the weekends. If I was starving for breakfast & in the area, I'd rather go to the Timmies on the corner & spend less on a filling breakfast."}
{"text":"Dundas Street Grille is our family's favourite brunch place, reasonably priced great diner grub and fast service.  Try the Breakfast for 2 or for 4 and you'll get a big silver platter of eggs,  bacon, ham, sausages, excellent home fries and pancakes. Their peameal bacon is wonderful and it's a great topping for their Grizzly Burger. As for their staff, they all light up when we come in the door and treat us like family. And one young waiter is my hero.  One day my husband stumbled while out getting a newspaper and hit his forehead on the flagstones outside the restaurant. This young man right away took him in hand, tended his wound and applied pressure to stop the bleeding, then stayed with him till the ambulance came.  He stopped what he was doing and looked after his injured customer calmly. We will never forget his kindness.  The staff are all great caring people like this."}
{"text":"The Grille is always a great spot for breakfast or brunch.  Yesterday my son and I checked it out for a late lunch.  

I chose the Liver and Onions.  It was delicious, baby beef liver, w crispy edges, lots and gravy and onions.  I had a side salad and a baked potato.  Large portion too big for me.  I recommend the liver and will definitely be back. The disappointment was frozen veg medley on the side.  I know The Grille for seriously good food - how hard would it be to offer a fresh seasonal veg? 

My son ordered a burger w Bacon Cheese which he enjoyed however I noticed from the \"bear paw\" shape that the burgers are pre-made.   Again how hard would it be for this restaurant to offer home made burgers?

A great spot always busy great service and really good food!"}
{"text":"I went with my mom today, I've been a few times. There is always a huge line which proves how good it is. We got sick of waiting in line and sat at the bar. There was a man behind the counter who got us drinks and he was amazingly attentive to us. The hostess ended up taking our orders. My mom got her usual, a asparagus and cheese omeltte and hasbrowns which she loves every time she goes there. I got the d`onion burger with fries. It's honestly the best burger i've ever had. Its a beef hamburger with sauted onions and mozza cheese on it. It's ammmmmazing!!! I usually have the chicken burger which is a great thing to order too. You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've come here a whole boatload of times and so far all has been great. I still love the back bacon sandwich but I would advise against their chicken soup. 

Also this place is packed on weekends and holidays so be prepared for a lineup but don't worry they are usually quite quick."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review with some background information.  I am not a big breakfast restaurant person, I prefer to eat the morning meal in the comfort of my own home.  I am also a late riser - often times waking up well after 11 or 12.  Put the two together and one would say, why even go to a breakfast joint?

Well, the simple answer is, as many others have discovered: there is a special something about going out for breakfast.  There is something fun about not just crawling out of bed, stumbling into the kitchen and breaking some eggs.  Going out for breakfast is different and that is why I like to do it on occasion.

Anyways, Dundas Street Grill is the best breakfast place I have been to in Etobicoke, granted I only know of two others.  If you come on weekends then there will be a lineup, especially if you come after 10.  The lineup can sometimes grow as large as out of the restaurant, so unless you are ok with waiting outside, make sure you arrive BEFORE 10.  On weekdays I have found it to be a relatively short line, if any at all.

The service in the place is good and the menu options aren't too expensive.  The menu is pretty standard, consisting of mostly egg-based dishes.  There are a few other types for people like myself who do not really eat eggs.  French toast and pancakes are two such dishes that I would strongly recommend.  The portions are good and will fill you up, unless you are really really hungry.

If you are leaning more towards lunch, then they whip out their lunch menu sometime after 11.  I have only been there for lunch once and can't remember what I got but both my friend and I were satisfied.

In general, a pretty good place but nothing exceptional.  Perhaps if I didn't get up at 12 and actually ate eggs I would have given the place a better rating."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this friendly Greek/Canadian diner. Convenient location right outside of the subway stop. We were seated promptly in a large booth. The server was helpful and attentive. The food was good and fresh. Also inexpensive. I had a Greek salad with a chicken skewer on it. The chicken was moist with good seasoning and the salad was classic and good with an ample amount of feta. Had to get a side of peameal bacon - they don't do it right in the US where I live. I left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Friendly, happy staff. Best home fries I have had in a long time. Nice and efficient service!"}
