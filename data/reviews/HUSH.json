{"text":"My husband and I came here for appetizers and drinks only.  Reasonably priced, nice interior, accommodating waitress, and food was pretty good.  It wasn't anything fantastic but I'd return for a decent meal.  The drinks we ordered were small, however, and not that much bigger than a shot glass it seemed.  Maybe it was just the type of drink we ordered but the glasses were quite small."}
{"text":"If you like your food cold (when it should be hot), then this is the place.    My partner and i had gone as this was a new restaurant that replaced our first date restaurant location \"Urban\"  The decor is nice but the food was not.  I ordered their lobster grilled cheese which came out semi warm (more on the coldish side) the lobster was cold and tasteless and the cheese was barely melted.  My partner ordered their seafood pasta which he said was cold, heavily  parmisianed and the sauce was tasteless.  Didn't make sense as there were only two tables that had people (one of them was ours)  The service was great tho and the s'mores dessert was fun  Would not go back"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews BUT... just finished eating at Hush and the food was good however the service was probably the worst I've ever experienced. Just a heads up.. if you are one to expect good customer service.. DON'T EAT HERE."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience on the rooftop patio. The raspberry lemonade was yummy! Our server Richie was very accommodating, we were in a rush & he got everything sent out quickly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tasty gastro pub.  Better than most on the 'theatre strip'.  I've been here for both Dinner/Drinks as well as for lunch.  Bit of an 'it' spot during lunch and can be quite busy.  Dinner was surprisingly quiet.... though this may change as things pick up.   Apparently there is going to be a patio in the near future... but there wasn't one when I visited (may 2012)"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband. We had the lettuce wraps to start and the tenderloin as a main. Both were very well prepared and delicious. My only complaint was the wait time for food but there was a large party there so that was likely the cause. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had the pear & goat cheese salad and Hush burger. The food are lacking of flavour and it was expensive too! The salad dressing wasn't mixed well and the burger were small and dry. Only the sweet potato fries tasted good."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The place was moderately busy at noon last Sunday, as we decided to get our meal before our 2pm show start time. We were a little disappointed that they no longer served brunch, because according to their website they did. After we placed our order, we waited almost a full hour to get our food. We ordered edamame, fish and chips and the lobster grilled cheese. The fish and chips were flavourless (needed a ton of salt to be added), and took way too long to get to us. The lobster grilled cheese I ordered was lukewarm and the cheese wasn't even melted. Honestly, I didn't think you could screw up grilled cheese but clearly I was wrong. I wished we went to a different place, but had no time. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Terrible experience; terrible food on Sunday, Feb. 16, 2014 - GO elsewhere for brunch.  We went with another couple for brunch after a mid-morning movie.  The restaurant wasn't busy.  Us:  Coffee please? Waitress:  We only have instant coffee and espresso. Comment:  What brunch place doesn't serve brewed coffee?  Us:  (Looking at the menu and seeing any type of eggs served) - friend says \"Poached eggs please\". Waitress:  We don't make poached eggs. Comment:  But your brunch menu says any type of eggs!  Poached eggs are pretty common.  Me:  I will have my eggs \"over-easy\" please - medium. Waitress:  We only do over-easy. Me:  You can make the over-easy eggs runny, medium or hard Waitress:  I didn't know that. Comment:  Please train the waitresses!  Waitress:  What type of bread would you like?  Us:  Rye bread please. Waitress:  I'm sorry - we only have whole wheat bread.  Us:  Ok, we will have whole wheat bread then. Comment:  You mean a restaurant doesn't have rye, brown or even white bread?  The meal was served and the food was cold. My over-easy eggs weren't what I ordered (yolk was broken and they were hard).    Overall the meal was mediocre at best.  The waitress knew it wasn't a good experience and she asked how the meal was.  After hearing everything again, she said that she will talk to the cook.   A better response would have been to refer us to the manager."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. But Yelp doesn't allow me to do that.  This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to in a very long time. And Toronto has a lot of shitty restaurants.   Not only was the food mediocre, but the service was awful. When I asked about the size of serving for a certain appetizer, the server's answers were useless. I had to fetch for answers.   When the food came, they mixed up my order with someone else's - they gave me their peanut-free appetizer when I actually ordered the same thing but as an entree. This resulted in the other person not getting their app at all and me having to eat my dinner while everyone else was having their apps. And then watching everyone around me have their entrees. When the servers realized the mistake, they didn't do anything about it. Not even an apology.  I got the Chicken wraps - the chicken was bland, the veggies were nothing special, and the sauce was not enough.  There were times when the server only asked selected people if they wanted another drink/water and when she came around with waters, she asked us to take them off her tray instead of placing them down herself.   When it came time to pay, they took forever and couldn't get the credit card machine to work. They made us wait a long time without updating us on the status of the \"unresponsive\" machine. When they finally got it to work, her rude co-server pointed out her mistake in front of everyone at the table. She must've been new and in training but at least pull her aside to teach her.  I asked to have the gratuity lowered or removed because the service was not up to standard and they tried to argue that it's mandatory that I pay 18% because it's \"just what they do with large parties\". I had to tell them several times that I have a right to remove the gratuity if I do not think the service is decent.  They are across from TIFF Bell Lightbox, which is the only reason why they get business. It's must be the reason why they don't feel they need to treat their guests with respect and serve them the way most places should.  I left in a bad mood and wrote this review as soon as I got home. That's how much it ruined my night."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall for a restaurant on the theatre strip, but then again, it's a restaurant on the theatre strip.  The staff is quite friendly and accommodating but unfortunately it's not good enough to outweigh so-so food.  Not that it's bad, it's just, eh.  The saving grace of this place are the do-it-yourself s'mores.  You get a plate of marshmallows, chocolate, graham crackers, some caramel and strawberries which you use to put together your idea of the perfect s'more.  Most fun-ly, you get a mini fire pit to roast your new creation.  It's really fun and tastes pretty good!  I would suggest skipping the entrees and going straight to drinks and the s'mores.  You'll end up having a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for dinner. The wicked thai soup is pretty decent, the lobster tacos were nothing special and the lobster had a bit of a shell in it. I ordered the hamburger which was pretty dry and plain. I had to ask for condiments because none were on it or provided with the burger. I would probably not come back as the other options in this area are wayyy better."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the Chicken wrap - tasteless. Slow service , but clearly not our waitresses fault who couldn't have been sweeter ."}
{"text":"I ended up at HUSH for lunch with a group of friends on a Thursday afternoon. Being a resident of Yonge & Eg, I've always considered the King West-ish area to be somewhat foreign. The lesser known restaurants never seemed worthy of a visit, which I considered more like fixtures of a landscape that scrolled by through a streetcar window, than actual establishments that people frequently patronized. I think HUSH falls perfectly into this category for me.   The patios were busy, but not crowded. The street-front patio is pretty small and I don't think I would feel comfortable eating in it, being so close to the pedestrian traffic. It seems ideal for drinks and people-watching though. The rooftop patio is much larger and can accommodate groups.  My impression of this place was poor, mainly due to the service. There were plenty of servers, but it took a really long time to get our order. It took even longer to get it right. We basically felt ignored for the entire meal.   Thankfully the food was alright. I tried the fish and chips which was a generous portion. They didn't have any features that day though, which I wasn't aware of until I tried ordering it. That meant they didn't have any pasta... at all.   Maybe we just had poor luck with our server. He might have been new. There was a pretty comical incident where he was walking out with a pint of beer for a customer, and a massive bee landed on the rim of the glass. He kind of watched it sit there, before it flew off. He then started walking towards the customer before seeing us, watching him almost make a bad decision. He turned around and went back to the bar to get a new pint (at least I hope).   So, the next time you're on the 504 streetcar, wondering what goes on in those restaurants along King, rest assured that people are eating meals and drinking beers, possibly contaminated by bee germs, eating average food, and being treated to mediocre service."}
{"text":"We tried their summerlicious menu, which looked amazing, but in terms of food quality was sub-par. The mussels served had half which were closed, the risotto was very clumpy (as if it were made from Asian sticky rice) and the chicken extremely dry. For dessert we got the creme brûlée - it was a bit shocking how it came served with raw sugar sprinkled on top, as they hid not completely burned it. I have never seen creme brûlée covered in so much white sugar. The custard itself was very eggy - one of my friends described it as tasting like 'scrambled eggs with sugar'  The staff however were pleasant and good interiors - great potential if the quality of food could be improved"}
{"text":"Service was good but out of most of the main dishes. Ended up ordering a California burger which came burnt and missing the avocado. Nice atmosphere but food was pretty bad for the price."}
{"text":"As the current duke I feel it's my duty to write a review of Hush.  I haven't had any food at Hush so I can't comment on that. I also don't expect to be going back very soon because I've mainly used Hush for Friday evening drinks on it's somewhat secret back patio. While all the patios on John St are packed you can easily sneak around the corner, through the 1st floor level of Hush, and up the stairs at the back for their 2nd story patio. It's got tables for 4 or 6 and a few loungy couch areas for getting cozy.  The service was pretty solid, but the waitresses do have to run up and down the stairs with all the drinks, so don't expect it to be too speedy. The prices are average, as is the decor.  Nothing much special about the place, but it does the job nicely when you need some booze and sun to forget about the work week."}
{"text":"Not the best food. The service was slow. Good location. It's a tourist place...don't go there if you're from TO."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and the patio was ideal for small groups. Very cozy, cool, and comfortable.   I had the poached pear and goat cheese, arugula salad- completely delicious.   The manager was friendly and welcoming to my group, which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, walking out of work, a friend and I were starving, so after a quick peek in (the interior drew us in - Interior is dark and very neat) we said \"why not\" ... well ...   Lets start with the server, she was nice, BUTTTT not very attentive, after the initial order of drinks, it took her 35 mins to come back, at this point we decided to skip right to the main course... now on to the food..   The menu is very plain and bland, and also there aren't very many choices for a vegetarian. So I decided to order something that stood out to me ... so I went on to ordering a Siam Red Curry Bowl (Vege) and the friend order a chicken salad (She's on a diet -_-) ... The food came quick, it was delicious and the presentation on the food was fabulous.   Desert was probably the best part of the night, ordered the white macadamia chocolate cookie with ice cream, the cookie is served hot in a dish, so its nice and \"guey\" to go along with your ice cream, def a nice touch.   All in all, its not a bad place for a weekday dinner, if the service was better, I would return ... maybe."}
{"text":"It was just meh.  The service was inattentive.  The food was salty and the drinks were brought out in thimble sized glasses.  Just a weird vibe too because the place was empty at prime dinner time."}
{"text":"This is a \"meh\" rest.   Sat on the rooftop patio on a gorgeous night and it looked like one server was serving the whole thing- which probably would have been fine had the patio not been up 2 flights of stairs and therefore the service was ridiculously slow.  Our app and mains came at the same time and they took forever. We ordered 1 martini each and we had to wave someone down after 20 minutes of an empty glass, we tried to order a bottle of wine and by the time they came back to tell us they were out of it we were done our food and just wanted our bill.  lousy service,meh food, great patio though."}
{"text":"Me and a friend arrived here for a dinner.  We thought we would try a place that we haven't been to before, and Hush has only been open for 3 weeks.  The place is a nicely decorated establishment.  It features lots wood with dark tones, with some modern stylish accents.  Our waiter was very friendly and polite.  He made recommendations on dishes to order, and was attentive to our table.  The menu features a variety of traditional North American food with some fusion of Thai, and Mexican.  They offer burgers, sandwiches, steaks, prime rib, chicken and various other dishes.  My friend, ordered a mixed drink and the wait was able to make a good recommendation.  We ordered an appetizer of Mung Thai Nachos, and different burgers for each of us.  Unfortunately, our order of Thai Nachos was forgotten.  The waiter was apologetic, and I was willing to give the place some leeway, since it is new.  The burgers were well presented.  The burgers were neatly assembled on a clean white plate.  The french fries were in a miniature deep fryer basket, which was placed on the place.  It is an interesting touch.  The portion size is just right, and I was comfortable full after eating everything.  The quality of the ingredients were good and an appropriate amount of topping was added.  I would rather have good quality over quantity.  Since the restaurant is relatively new, there are some minor growing pains that they are going through.  Despite this I would return to this place and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"The rooftop patio is very nice and cosy!  My short rib was overcooked and the meat was dry. I've never had a bad short rib. Guess there is a first time for everything!"}
{"text":"Food was dece. Service was above average. Waitresses were good looking."}
{"text":"Great place. Visited in during winterlicious, very cozy and classy interior. Food was delicious and creative menu. Worth it, will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went here on a friends birthday last month and was not too impressed. My drinks were good but the food was bland and overcooked- the other girls who had the same dish were also generally unimpressed. We all had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. In my opinion the chicken tasted like an overcooked chicken nugget that I would make at home, except I wouldn't overcook it. We also had the s'mores dessert which was lovely but I could see it being a fire hazard when marshmallows are catch on fire. I most likely won't return unfortunately."}
{"text":"Pros: - HUSH was one of the only places in the entertainment district that allowed me to make a dinner reservation for 12 people on  a Saturday night - lobster spinach dip was very good - fair prices on food - our waitress gave us excellent service, even asked if we wanted separate bills and pointed out that gratuity was automatic - nice ambiance - the s'mores dessert had great presentation and was delicious - my sister ordered the lobster grilled cheese, which I would recommend. Yummy!  Cons: - I ordered the fish and chips, and although it looked great, it was a bit overcooked so that the breading was hard to cut through and crumbled away from the fish"}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch spot with good value for money and friendly service.  When you just want a classic brunch with no frills, but in a classy location without paying too much, this is your ticket.  They have all the brunch classics, and the décor is quiet and comfortable to have a conversation in, being set in muted blacks in a modern sleek interior. There's also a patio at the top when the weather is nice.  The service was friendly and accommodating; they were very accommodating when I wanted to substitute the home fries for a fruit plate.  Prices are quite reasonable as well for King St., and the server was always filling up our coffee.  This place offers the full brunch experience without pretension, delivering good food and good conversation."}
{"text":"I feel that there is so much good food in Toronto, a lot of times it comes down to the service and attitude of the wait staff and the ambiance.  It is for this reason I give HUSH 5 stars.  This review is based on my experience from the summertime. I needed a spot for 15 people and I wanted a rooftop patio.  Most places didn't make rooftop rezos and also made it pretty clear that I wouldn't get a spot up top.  However HUSH was so super friendly in the phone and when I arrived, indeed they accommodated my party of 15 on the rooftop.  The kitchen staff/ people in the front were positively lovely, the friendliest I've ever met, always asking me how things were going when I came down.  Our waitress was on top of food orders and pouring wine, despite our large crowd and some other folks that came later unexpectedly (so we had maybe 20 total?)  My only disappointment was that there was no view on the rooftop.  Initially I was looking for a place that had a stunning view.  But whatever, HUSH made up for it in other areas.    Overall I'll definitely be coming back... Looking forward to patio season!"}
{"text":"I went back to HUSH over the weekend. I had a much better experience. I took some friends from out of town here as we were walking along King St. W. area. We ordered three drinks: the jolly rancher martini, wasabi ceasar and pineapple mojito. All the drinks were really food. The ceasar was spicy with a nice twist using the wasabi. The jolly rancher martini tasted like a jolly rancher. It was good.   To share we order the lobster tacos. DELICIOUS. the ingredients used were fresh and made the dish quite refreshing. We also got the shrimp and lobster dip which was also very good. The only thing is I wish we got more bread, we only got 4 pieces and chips but those didn't taste the same. We had to ask for more and the guy only brough two wedges. Oh well. The dip itself was great and we wanted to savor it, that's all."}
{"text":"Located at a semi-famous strip in downtown Toronto, with a good dozen restaurants in a row.  They all look so nice, especially at night, are usually pretty busy, with tiny patios in the front for the summer.  (apparently this one and others also have rooftop patios but you can't see them from the street so I always forget to try them).  I'd noticed this place before, never having heard a word about it from anyone.  What made me decide to try?  Driving by that morning, knowing we had to pick out a restaurant to bring an out-of-towner with similar taste as myself, it just looked right.  Atmosphere:  Semi-dark, modern, chic, simple.  Some cool/unmemorable decor.  Long & narrow in shape.  I'd guess 20 tables?  I did not venture toward the back room though, where it's possible it's bigger.  Service:   Upon walking in, we were greeted before the door even hit us in the ass.  Good.  Noticed the place was empty: questionable.  (Sunday at 5:30pm roughly.)  The waitress must've been experiencing her first day on the job, because she had someone (manager?  senior waitor?  owner?) attached to her hip.  He mentioned if we need to use the washroom, we'll have to go across the street since they don't have one.  For a split second, I believed that.  It was a joke.  But a great way to start off on the right foot for just arriving.  He said we had our choice of any table we'd like, so we opted for the one right by the window.  When he took my wine bottle order, he offered me a straw.  Total straight face hilarious.  He actually did then bring the straw, a 2-foot one for my bottle.  :)  I tried to drink from it for fun, but couldn't reach it to my mouth without spilling the wine at that angle.  Service during the meal was just as great.  When it got past the dessert time, after about two hours, I'm guessing unfortunately the guy went on a break or was busy elsewhere because the girl didn't come to our table to bring the bill for a good half an hour?  We had to go up to the cash to ask for it and then she was all smiles approaching us, without realizing the delay was bad.  This threw in the face of the superior service the rest of the visit.  I give it the benefit of the doubt that it was just her inexperience and won't let this affect me going back.  If it happened a second time, I'd question it....  Menu: Yummy veggie spring rolls for appetizer (the prices are not listed on the online menu unfortunately).  I don't remember how much they were, but guessing something in the $8-12 range?  More or less, I'd be surprised. Apparently the NY strip loin was good, but nothing extraordinary.  Nice size, cooked okay, mushrooms & peppercorns on top.  Good veg primavera linguini.  It's hard to screw that up if you ask me though.  Dessert was the best part: S'mores roasted on skewers at the table over our own little burner!  Handful of marshmallows, graham cookies, thin chocolate pieces with heated caramel to pour over it.   Go back???  Definitely."}
{"text":"I've been to Hush a couple of times a while back. Great service and great food. Now it's gone down the drain. I went here with my fam for brunch and it was bad experience. I'll definitely won't go back ever again. Food was not great and the service was horrible. Our Waitress disappeared and didn't even acknowledge that she was no longer waiting our table. Food took forever to come (restaurant was not busy at all).  Worse service ever."}
{"text":"The nachos were pretty good mainly the sauce. Shrimp tacos were decent too. Nice rooftop patio . The dip we had (crab?) was just okay."}
{"text":"This place has become a favorite weekend lunch spot for my girlfriend and I. Try the Thai Chicken Roll Up and the Sweet Potato fries. The place has friendly service and a great roof top patio for the summer. If you're grabbing food with friends, definitely get the S'mores desert, delicious and fun!  I don't usually write a lot of reviews, but thought this place deserved some love. It's definitely a surprising standout on strip that has a lot of lesser options.  Edit: -1 for poor vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Hush is one of our go to place for steak. Friendly service, prices reasonable for the neighbourhood. The decor is modern and the seating is comfortable.  Located right across frontier Lighthouse, makes this a great place to take in the film festival buzz."}
{"text":"Ventured into HUSH twice over this past weekend.    On Friday night, a big group of us ventured over to HUSH for a family meal at about 9 pm.  We were seated right away and the service was spot on from the beginning.  The food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad by any means.  We all had a great time and never felt rushed, etc.  The next day we ventured back in with a smaller group for some drinks.  We decided to sit at the bar inside to escape the heat.  The manager, Jeff, was our server and he was amazing to us.  He was so friendly and accomodating and quite funny to boot!  We ended up having quite a few drinks before we had to leave.    HUSH was one of our better bar/restaurant experiences while in Toronto.  The food is not amazing, but the service is very good!"}
{"text":"Went here a few nights ago for dinner with my family and was pretty impressed. The decor was hip and modern and the staff were friendly, especially the hostess who seated us right by the front window (looking forward to checking out the rooftop patio when it's a bit warmer). Immediately upon entering, I saw people roasting marshmallows over a little table top flame which I thought was cool. We didn't get dessert but maybe I will try it next time! Overall the food was very good; we got the seafood linguine, lobster grilled cheese, Moroccan chicken and the lettuce wraps to share. I was really happy with the Moroccan chicken because I usually find that with spicy food, it's not spicy enough but this was just right, nice and flavourful too. My mom also got the purple rain cocktail and it was extremely sweet but good! Last, the prices were decent; I would probably visit again."}
{"text":"My review is a bit of pros and cons regarding my recent visit for a friend's b-day.   PROS -  1)  The food was good. Some of us ordered from their Winterlicious menu, and some from the regular menu. I had the seafood linguine which was a great portion size for about $16, as well as a martini that was under $7. No complaints with those. Friends of mine had ordered the edamame, and the parm crusted chicken with veggies, and they were all very happy with their meals.   2) I think the prices were pretty good for the location (King St West, near John). most of us spent about $30-35 each for drinks, meals, tax and tip included.   3) The atmosphere was nice.  The setting was comfortable, and the music was good, and only loud enough that we could still hold conversation.   4) Very accommodating - our server was great with her recommendations and made suggestions of what she thought were good options. She was honest about the menu options in terms of what tastes great and the feedback she's gotten from other people she's served.   CONS -  1) We made reservations earlier that week, and when speaking with the staff on the phone, the person we spoke to indicated that it would be difficult to accommodate our party of approx. 10-15 people, but they managed to fit us in to their Friday evening. Low and behold when we got there....it wasn't exactly packed to the brim, so I'm not sure what the issue was when we made the reservation. There was plenty of space, which we appreciated.   2) One of the tables that were set up for our guest wasn't stable and kept swaying by a considerable distance between guests and both sides, making it a little challenging to eat and share food.   3) Service was a little slow. I'm sorry to say it, because I think the staff were very friendly and attentive to meeting our individual needs, but the wait times between ordering drinking, getting apps, mains, and desserts, and receiving our  bills took some time, and by the end of the night the restaurant was close to empty.    MISC -  Not sure if they restaurant did anything complimentary for our friend's birthday. When I spoke with our server to find out if they did anything (such as a free dessert), I was told that for an extra charge, they would add a sparkler to her dessert (providing she had ordered one). But to be fair, I didn't get a chance to see her bill, so I'm not sure if any part of her meal was comp'd by the restaurant.   - - All in all: I would go back to try some of their other menu options and drinks and I would recommend it to anyone visiting or living in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Stopped back into HUSH for brunch this Sunday, and unfortunately the buffet brunch is no longer an option. It's been replaced by a handful of menu options of standard brunch fare, without any of the various additional options that made this such a unique find in the first place. The current brunch options end up costing almost as much as the buffet did, and they did away with the sangria special as well.  The waitress seemed to think that the buffet brunch and sangria special were summer only items - I hope that's the case. If they're not brought back, I can't justify giving this place better than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends after work on a Friday evening.  We sat at their well-known rooftop patio to enjoy the beautiful summer weather.  The interior of the restaurant was very classy and modern and their rooftop patio was very nice, except the view wasn't the best of views.  Once seated, we were asked if we'd like to start with a drink.  They have daily specials throughout the week but I ended up ordering their Red Sangria, which in my opinion wasn't anything special and I've had better.  My next round of drinks was their Amsterdam Blonde that was on special, thought I'd give it a try, why not.  For food, I decided to go with their Lobster Grilled Cheese with Sweet Potato Fries, which I thought was the most delicious grilled cheese I have ever had, especially cause it had seafood inside.  I highly recommend trying this item and don't stinge out on the sweet potato fries!  The third round of drinks I tried The 303 (absolut vodka, cucumber, basil, lime and gingerale). I thought this drink was quite refreshing but the others thought otherwise.  I did not have room for dessert after all the food and drinks but I definitely will come back to try their S'mores Dessert!  Overall, the service was okay, I've definitely had better. But because the food was so delicious, I will definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"My mother and I went for lunch during summerlicious.  My appetizer (beet and chèvre salad) and entree (pasta with peas, mushrooms and cream sauce) were AMAZING! My moms Thai salad and the chocolate dessert we shared were pretty good too. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Just like many tourist trap restaurants, this one had terrible service and mediocre food.  We were there for a birthday party, we had about 12 people there.  Everyone arrived for 9, ordered their food, and we didn't get it until 10:45 - almost 2 hours!  Drinks took about 30 minutes and the waitress, Lorilynn, was defensive and snooty about it when we addressed it.  The food was bland, and seemed very tourist - big portions, good presentation, but tastes like they just threw sauce at it.  We had ribs that tasted like sweet thai and BBQ sauce mixed together.  Everything was deep fried.  The decor was nice, it's too bad their service is awful, for a service industry, you really have to look out for that...  Worst part is - she tipped herself 18% gratuity, I would not have given her that."}
{"text":"I have come here a couple of times and I have to say the service was really great. Servers are very friendly and accommodating.   On one occasion, I had the focaccia clubhouse sandwich and it was very good. I really liked the creamy sun dried tomato mayonnaise. On another occasion, we shared the white chocolate chip cookie sundae with caramel sauce, and although it was something I could have made myself at home, we really enjoyed it.  Something a little bizarre occurred the last time we were there. A woman and her older aunt came to the restaurant and the former starting talking to us. Before they left, the woman came up to both of us and planted wet, slobbery kisses on each of us. We were both left speechless and after a few moments just burst out giggling, while one of the servers just starred in disbelief. He had said that he had never seen anything like that ever happen in the restaurant and apologized on the lady's behalf. I guess there's a first time for everything. It's a good thing that we had already finished eating, because I think I would have lost my appetite!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We ordered lettuce wraps, and followed by main course. The restaurant was little too empty but I was a weekday but all restaurants around Hush had waiting. The menu is just a bunch of things put together, nothing exquisite about this place. Relatively pricey as we paid over 100 bucks for 2 people and didn't even eat a full course meal. Good place to have a quiet dinner"}
{"text":"I chose this place for summerlicious after reading really good reviews and menu selection.  HOWEVER. i think coincidentally either the chef was on holiday or he had a grudge against me.  Appetizer: mussels...SALTY. one sip of the broth and i chugged my glass of wine AND water  they brought the mains out before clearing the table, so my girls and I helped the waitress out and piled our dishes neatly so she can put our mains down.  Main: swordfish....nice thick and juicy cut. It was cooked well, however it was over seasoned and on the salty side. At this point im still waiting for the waitress to refill our glasses. OH and the dish comes with deep fried avocados rolls, so i thought yes literally deep fried avocado fries of some sort. Get this, deepfried california roll with a thin slice of avocado that you can barely see. DKM, it was like all hope was lost.  dessert: Cereal Milk Crème Brûlée aka Traditional crème brûlée served with a cornflake brittle. mmmmmmMMMMMMM doesn't that sound so delish? but SURPRISE!  it was a less than average traditional creme brulee, it was liquidy and not solid.  I think this place has potential but I am very disappointed in the food and service. The whole point of summerlicious is to try the quality of the restaurant's offering so that you'll remember to come back to try other things and recommend to others. Unfortunately that won't be the case for me :("}
{"text":"We spontaneously walked into Hush around 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon after discovering Toronto on foot.  It was lovely.  Our server couldn't have been more gracious, extremely nice.  We ate simply; I had their Thai Crunch Salad, which was light and delicious and full of interesting tidbits -- an array of greens, bok choy, spicy peanuts, chicken, mandarin oranges and more.  My husband had a burger (like he always does!) although he couldn't have it cooked medium rare -- a Canadian health regulation requires all meat to be cooked to at least medium?  A glass of Canadian wine was also quite nice.  The ambiance was quiet, super pleasant."}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of coming here for brunch. Maybe they are still working out the kinks, who knows. But for the over-inflated price of $17.99 I would expect better. The fruit selection is fresh, I'll give it that - but rather lacklustre. The brunch has the ubiquitous bacon, omelette station, scrambled eggs, sausages and pastries.  I am lactose-intolerant. Surprisingly many people are lactose intolerant. The omelette station uses eggs from a carton and surprise surprise it's eggs with milk. Since lactose-intolerance is fairly prevalent it would stand to reason that the restaurant make the effort to use carton-eggs which are milk free.   I had asked for a la carte menu - dismissive response was \"oh sorry, not available\". How the f*ck can you cater to dietary needs if there is no one to do it? I mean, how difficult is it to not add milk to scrambled eggs?  Mind you, for $17.99 I expect them to use fresh real eggs.   I had two pieces of toast, two watermelon slices & 6 slices of bacon - obviously I got my money's worth. Not.  If you value your tastebuds, enjoy the concept of good customer service, and not have your concerns dismissed out of hand then do not go to this shambles of a restaurant.  If you enjoy being treated in a shabby manner please feel free to patronise this restaurant. This person, on the other hand, values her wallet and her spare time."}
{"text":"Part of the next part of our anniversary night we came here for dessert round 2! For smores and a really nice place to lounge and be all romantic was perfect. Took a very long to get our smores but the waiter informed us it was because there were only a limited allowed smores fires to be used in that restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh!    We stopped here for wine and nibbles.  I'm giving this place 2 stars only (1 for the wine and the second for our server).   We ordered their Thai Nachos, on our server's recommendation - blech!  Very disappointing...however, my friend had chosen a great wine so we focused primarily on consumming it, our conversation and then gettting outta there.  Interesting to note that the owner of this place also owns Hey Lucy and Gabby's next door.    I know that we only tried one dish, but it was the one recommended by the server.  I might return to give it another try, but I doubt it.  Decor is nice Menu is all over the map Prices for both food and wine are reasonable Service was very good"}
{"text":"Went to HUSH with a friend on a Sunday. Arrived right before 2pm so I was still able to order brunch. I had French toast. It was good, not amazing but good. The portion was big, I couldn't finish all of it. We shared an appetizer, a spinach dip and it was really yummy!"}
{"text":"After trying to get in to Khao San Road and being told that there would be a two hour wait for a table (and and hour and 45 minute wait for take-out), my friends and I decided to try Hush as it was a nearby restaurant.  We were promptly seated at a booth at the back of the restaurant. The ambiance is nice, but a bit odd because it seems to be a mix of a semi-upscale restaurant with a bar with big screen TVs.   As I was planning on having Thai food that night I decided to have their Mild Thai Curry Bowl (Chicken & shrimp, sweet peppers, green onions, seasonal vegetables, nappa and bok choy with mild Thai curry sauce, served on jasmine rice in a fresh cut pineapple bowl. Garnished with fresh pineapple $18.50). I had asked if it could be made extra spicy and our waitress said that it would be possible, so I was excited to try this dish.   The food was presented inside of a pineapple slices in half. What I had not realized was that the rice would be in the bottom of the pineapple with the sauce and meat / vegetables on top. I didn't really like this dish as I found that the sauce was not very flavourful and it certainly was not spicy. I would not order this dish again.  As we were a group of friends from camp we decided that it would only be fitting for us to try out the table-top s'mores for dessert. This was a fun dish to share and a unique experience.  This is a decent restaurant in the area, but I wouldn't rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking to grab a bite and a drink at around 9:45pm on a Thursday. Even though, Hush usually closes at 10pm, we thought we'd give it a shot, since it looked really nice. We were greeted enthusiastically by Lindsay, who asked us not to worry about the time and ensured that we were quickly seated at a comfortable spot of our liking. Lindsay was very attentive and definitely gave us the kind of service that needs to raved about. She took our orders and was quick to get us our drinks and after mains, whilst ensuring that we're comfortable. We wanted to stay for desserts, but we got too full. What impressed me was that even though it was well past 10 by this time, and staff was seen cleaning up, Lindsay asked us if we'd like any desserts or drinks. Truly selfless. Great service, beautiful ambience and delicious food. Looking forward to having dinner there once again!"}
{"text":"Dropped by hush for dinner after checking the Bond exhibit over at the tiff lightbox. My gf and I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and the Thai nachos. The lobster was on point, buttery but not greasy, big lobster pieces compared to the ones served by Joey at the eaton centre. The nachos though were a disaster. It was so greasy that we barely touched it. When the manager came he asked us about the food so I gave him my opinion about what we ordered. Seeing the nachos were barely touched, he got them and mentioned that he was taking it off the bill. MaybE it was an off night for the person who made them, but we really appreciate what the restaurant did for us. However we are NOT keen to come back."}
{"text":"Cute dainty place, food was alright. Not bad, not amazing. But a good spot for a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"We had a birthday dinner last Friday night at Hush with about 15 people. Hush for me has the potential to be an amazing restaurant. The interior is beautiful, modern and cozy. It's located on King Street right in front of the Tiff Theatres and have wonderful staff who are attentive and friendly.   The food however is another story.I ordered the lobster tacos and we found it unseasoned, had a lot of water and generally not very good. For our mains, I ordered the seafood pasta and I found that there were way to many ingredients in the sauce including brocolli and not enough fresh seafood. However, it tasted okay. My boyfriend ordered their steak and fries and found everything too salty. Their fries had kosher salt crystals on top. Our friend on the other side found the same experience with the fries but his burger was under seasoned. Overall, I think seasoning could be improved.   However, the best part of our meal was the smores dessert where they allow you to toast your marshmellows and create smore sandwiches at the table. This experience brought back child hood joy to everyone! It was great :)"}
{"text":"Went to Hush after a TSO on a Friday evening for appetizers.   It was quite empty.  We were seated in the lounge area at the back.   We ordered Moscato wine, nachos, sweet potato fries followed by s'mores.   The Moscato wine was absolutely perfect for my taste. Sweet but not like ice wine sweet. It was light.   Nachos were not really to my liking.  Sweet potato fries were delicious and freshly made.   Now to the best part of the evening.  S'mores!!!!!!! Absolutely delectable!!!! As a child I had never experienced eating this delicious dessert, boy was my childhood ever incomplete!  They serve it with graham crackers, chocolate, strawberries and of course your marshmallows that you roast on a beautiful little flame in an iron cup like thing. ( sorry don't know what it's called but you can look at the pics for a better idea ).   It can get messy but it is definitely worth it.   From now on, it will be a tradition to drop by here after a show or a Tso on king at west.   Reason for a 4 is that the staff didn't seem to be as courteous and prompt as they should of been. Especially since there were only two other tables of pairs in the lounge area and two waiters.   But I will return for the s'mores!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a smokehouse burger. Our party had 4 of the same burger and they all came with dry beef patty. Taste is on the bland side.  Other dishes might be better."}
{"text":"Not the best patio view however the atmosphere was pleasant. The food was well made however there was not much variety."}
{"text":"Shrimp 100% from a can, chicken breast that was as dry as wood, dessert from a corner store box. I wish I'd taken pictures. The only reason for 1 star is our server was super nice."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Came here for Winterlicious tonight before catching a show. The restaurant decor is really nice. It's sleek, modern and hip. I see that they have a roof top patio so I'd be interested in checking it out one day. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and got seated right away. Our waitress was also very friendly and we asked her for her opinion on some food and she tried her best to recommend the food items to us.   I end up ordering the market greens with poached pear, steak salad and chocolate something. My friend ordered butternut squash ravioli and strawberry cake. The market greens were good, however I feel like these are the same market greens you can buy from the grocery store. The poached pear made it decent. My steak salad was okay, I thought the steak was cooked well, but the flavour wasn't the greatest. It had a strong char flavour. My friends ravioli was delicious. More on the creamy side. When the desserts came the waitress did say that the strawberry was super sweet but when we tried it, it was light and fluffy. My chocolate dessert was extremely sweet but good.   I'm not sure I would come back. It was an okay meal but nothing amazing that I can report. We had a good meal but it wasn't anything spectacular or unique that I can add to this review."}
{"text":"I tried the tapas menu at Hush Restaurant. It was pretty good. As a part of the $20 deal, you get three tapas and an Estrella Damm beer. The tapas included a fried mussel in a half-shell, a flank steak roulade, and a panko crusted tomato caprese. Of the three apps, my favourite was the steak. I liked the spicy kick to it. The patatas bravas that go with it was pretty good too. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. They have nice patio outdoors. They also have a rooftop patio but we didn't check it out. In terms of service though, our waitress barely checked up on us and she forgot my coffee. We had to go inside the restaurant to ask for our waitress so that we could order more food. Apart from that, I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The only dish that I like from Hush is their fish and chips, besides that nothing really stood out. The customer service was very poor...our waitress never refilled our water and never followed up with us regarding the food. They stood around near the bar area (first floor) and chatted. The interior of the restaurant is classy and spectacular."}
{"text":"I had The 303 cocktail and it was so good and fresh that I had another instead of an appetizer.  It had vodka, ginger ale, mint, basil, and cucumber. My friends were all over the prime rib poutines, but I wasn't as hungry so I waited for my main. we all had burgers, and they were definitely above par. They have shortrib inside which you basically can't mess up, but the buns were amazing as were the toppings. Mine had bacon and I find sometimes burger bacon can be too soft, but this bacon was perfectly crispy. My only complaint with the food is that the caesar I had on the side was sub-par -- very little dressing and no bacon or anything. Nonetheless, I would return. My whole group said it was a nice find."}
{"text":"Took the the team for a celebration dinner based off of the yelp reviews and location. What's amazing place. Food and service was great!!!  Would definitely go back and recommend going."}
{"text":"I have been to hush a couple times for both lunch and dinner.  They have a GREAT yet small roof patio with cool seating and a bunch of loungey couches.  I LOVE the lobster grill cheese there which is extremely rich made with 3 typs of nice cheese and very crispy [like fried] bread.  The sweet potato fries are awesome [no extra cost] and come with a great spicy mayo sauce.  Both times I have been there I have goten the same thing, but everyone I have been with has also liked there meals.   The service for me has been great although you will probably end up being served by 3 - 4 different servers..   Great place to relax with friends on a nice hot day and take in some son while eating some tasty food and having some drinks.  I will continue to go back here"}
{"text":"I went to Hush last night before seeing a movie at the Bell Lightbox and had a \"Winterlicious\" meal for the first time (!).  I had their Edamame to start which was a very large portion. Edamame is simple enough so I don't really have much to say about it...but my friend had the Wicked Thai Soup and really enjoyed it. For the entree, I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was, in a word, delectable. It came with some vegetables and I chose fries which was a great decision as their fries were AMAZING. They don't give you too many or too few, it was just right. They were crispy and perfect, reminded me of Swiss Chalet fries (my personal faves). As for the chicken, it was a huge, juicy portion that was a little too big for me but I didn't care...I never wanted it to end! My friend had the Mild Thai Curry bowl and wasn't thrilled by it, but it 'wasn't bad'.  For dessert, we both had the skillet cookie.....*drool*. The DIY S'mores people mentioned below sounded so interesting, but this cookie was an excellent choice. It was big but not too big, WARM, and drizzled with caramel...came with ice cream too. It was a perfect ending to a great meal. Our server was courteous and I didn't feel like we had to wait long for anything, management was also very nice and we felt welcome. I would go back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for HUSH.  I normally woudln't eat anywhere on this \"strip\" (King West theater district, typically overpriced restaurants for mediocre food). But we were starving and wanted to try something new and Hush fit the bill.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. The decor was very nice, dark and trendy and the place was packed even at 6pm on a Saturday night.   The food was presented really nicely, great portion and was definitely tasty. Unfortunately, the menu was kind of boring. Some burgers, wraps, salads, prime rib, a few pasta dishes, chicken dishes, etc. They were really playing it safe with the menu.  I tried the daily special - a chicken breast cooked with sundried tomato paste and spinach inside, served with sweet potato fries. The food was delicious! I would definitely eat it again. Reasonable priced at $16.50. My dining companion tried the parmesan crusted chicken and paired it with roasted fingerling potatoes, which was a hit with her.  They have a decent wine menu with glasses from $7.50 and bottled from $34. The Beauleiux Cab Merlot we tried was great. The had cocktails starting from $7.50 too.  I'd like to go back and try the \"Campfire Smores\" dessert, where they bring a burner to your table and you get to make DIY smores with graham crackers, masrhmallows and Lindt chocolate. We watched enviously as a table nearby cooked theirs. Looked fun!  The service was great, servers were obviously new but they tried really hard to be pleasant and quick. Food came out quickly and the bill appeared when we wanted it."}
{"text":"Service: 1/10 Food: 3/10 Ambience: 6/10   My girlfriends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon and we ate on the patio. It's cute but the place was dead.. Wonder why??   Since the place was dead we didn't think it would be an issue if we choose our own seats. But the server told us we couldn't. Okay.   We ordered the sangria and wanted shots of brandy, the server flat out told us she doesn't know her alcohol and doesn't know if they have brandy. Please hire staff who are knowledgable especially if they are  working in an alcoholic establishment.   We ordered about 4 appetizers to share, and we were brought out side plates. ALL OF THEM WERE DIRTY. When we asked for new ones because they were dirty, a rude supervisor came by with so much attitude and said \"yeah I know it's dust.\" She tooked the plate and walked away. DUST?!   The food was okay, order the salad with salon, lobster dip, lobster tacos (horrible) and sweet potato fries. Most of the items seem like they were lacking flavour.   Will not be coming back. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Hosted my boyfriends birthday here. Initially had made reservations for 12 and needed more seats so they accommodated 15. The staff were all friendly and attentive to our needs. The prices are not bad given the amazing location. I ordered poutine and it was good. The restaurants ambiance was beautiful. The only con I would say is that when I asked the staff if they could bring in the cake and sing happy birthday, they refused. It was okay because we did it ourselves, I just found that kind of rude."}
{"text":"Went to meet a friend there for lunch since she worked nearby and i had the freedom to be able to just spend the day downtown.  Hush is yummy, love the rooftop patio. I would definitely go back again =)"}
{"text":"The Thai Nachos were great as were the Tuesday Mojitos for $6. But the California Burger and side salad was depressing ... the burger was over cooked and extremely dry. The side salad was very wilted and looked like it had been sitting out for hours.  It took a long time to serve us the food. And the reason was bc they were out of toothpicks to cut our burger in 1/2.  The service was great. The bartender followed up to see if we liked our Mojitos. Michelle the waitress was polite and check up on us.  But when we communicated about the sad state of the salad no response came for about 10min later.   Glad i went and tried them once. But dont know if I will go back."}
{"text":"Lobster spinach dip = still craving it. We walked here from our hotel across the street for lunch on a Sunday after traveling all day. Really cool ambiance, sort of a rustic vibe. Bar area towards the back with TVs. We also got the chicken wrap which was tasty. Service was lacking, never got refills (which I needed bad!!), had to ask twice for the check, the waitress was sort of snappy...and not in the fast kind of way.   We actually went back again though our last night, and the service was much better from the girl in the bar area. Got the lobster grilled cheese, Ceasar salad, and the lobster dip again. Happy campers!"}
