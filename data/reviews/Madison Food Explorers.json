{"text":"This Lake to Lake tour was great. As much as it was a food tour, it was equally a lesson in local history. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the tour alone with Andrea, who showed us great views from atop the Capitol building and from the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed convention and community center.   Our first stop was at Merchant. The owner sat down with us and told us about their philosophy. We had a delicious Cubano sandwich. Each of the other five destinations did not disappoint.   You will leave the tour satisfied with the food and with a little better picture of the city."}
{"text":"Loved this tour - a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon! I took the Lake to Lake tour with a friend and we loved walking around to a ton of classic Madison restaurants and landmarks. Erica was awesome and knew an impressive amount about local history, architecture, and more which gave me a fresh perspective on Madison as we went through the tour. I left that afternoon with a full and happy stomach and I'm excited to try more of what Madison Food Explorers has to offer!"}

{"text":"My family and I took the lake to lake tour and it was fantastic!  Our tour guide Kyle was very friendly and knowledgable.  We have visited Madison several times but this  tour gave us an insiders glimpse of the Madison food scene.  We learned about many restaurants on the tour and several others as we walked the city streets.  Kyle was very courteous and knew many local stories which enhanced this enjoyable experience.  We have two children ages 16 and 12 and they loved the tour too!  I would recommend this tour to anybody who would like to learn about the local history of the food scene in Madison!  Great job!"}
{"text":"My husband and I participated in this tour today, and really enjoyed ourselves. It was the perfect mix of seeing the Madison isthmus, enjoying a sampling of food at numerous locations, and learning more about Madison and the downtown area.   Our guide was knowledgeable about architecture and Madison history. The pace of the tour was good, and the walking distance was perfect (from the Frank Lloyd Wright Monona Terrace to the Memorial Union on Lake Mendota).   I'm a Madison native, and my husband is a transplant. We found plenty to enjoy in this tour, and will definitely suggest it to guests in the future."}
{"text":"Destination: Willy Street is such a great neighborhood for this tour. It is a very walkable neighborhood and easily accessible to walk from place to place.  Food: Some great stops along the way, including a bakery and a recently opened restaurant.  Madison info: Our tour guide had a lot of stories about everything we were walking past, which was great for the newcomers to Madison.  Overall: Great way to get to know and neighborhood and enjoy some tasty food. Would do again in another neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on the lake to lake tour with guide Stanley. We we super excited to eat and tour our way through Madison!! We've done 3 walking food tours prior to this one and were excited to add it to our list.  There were many things we loved about this tour; Stanley's enthusiasm, the beautiful day and great walking weather, the folks we chatted with on the tour and *most* of the food.  The tour was extremely slow to get going. We were all very hungry; eating small breakfasts and no morning snacks in anticipation of a heavy food afternoon.  The tour began promptly at 12:30. We spent a very long time in the Convention Center talking about Frank Lloyd Wright. And then when we left the history part of the tour continued for an hour. The first tasting of any food did not happen until a little after 1:30. First stop was Merchant, a funky restaurant/bar, where we were served a Small quarter of a cuban sandwich and a tiny arugula salad dressed in vinaigrette. The Cubano was very good but the serving we seriously tiny. Then we lingered waaaay too long (in my opinion) at the Merchant sitting at the table even though everyone had been done for a while.  After the merchant we made Lots of little stops to look at landmarks around the capital area. And we did a little walk through of the capital building, which was very beautiful, but my tummy was still rumbling!!!!  2:22  was our second stop at Fromagination Cheese Shop.  This was an absolutely adorable shop with oodles of cheese as well as other gormete food stuffs like cookies, pastries, honey, balsamic vinegar, mustard, jams and jellies and other gift stuff . 3 small pieces of cheese and 2 crackers. There were also a few samples around the store for tasting but really it was a very small food sampling.   Shortly after that around 2:44 we made it to Ian's Pizza for a half-slice of Mac and cheese pizza. Ehhh. Did not like it. They had some really cool other kinds and just an awesome menu in general. Just was not into the Mac and Cheese slice. Ick  Next up was a little after 3:00 and we stopped at Himal Chuli which was a Nepalese eatery for a Mango Lassi. I was disappointed that we did not get to go inside the restaurant. We just grabbed-and-go our drinks and walked to our next stop.   At around 3:17 we stopped into State Street Brats where we were served half to a third of a brat and A half pint of Spotted Cow  beer from New Glarus Brewery. Good tasting. But again, a very small sample  Lastly we walked to UW campus to the student union for a vanilla malt. It was good. Wish we had gotten to try the ice cream. I'm sure they have some great flavors there. The union was amazing however, right on the lake. Lucky students. The tour ran over, ending around 3:45.  My husband and I left still feeling kind of hungry which has NEVER happened to us after a food tour.  So, we had a fun time but left with mixed feelings about the tour. Not sure how much we will recommend this one to ours friends. Would rather send them down to the zerve.com food tours in Chicago."}
{"text":"A friend and I did the Monroe Street tour and it was awesome! We sampled from a variety of restaurants and learned a lot about the history of the foods, the restaurants and neighborhood we were in. Erica is a phenomenal tour guide. A great way to spend the afternoon for visitors and locals."}
{"text":"Tour was awesome!  So much food overall!  Everyplace we stopped was ready for us and accommodating.  Great variety of foods:  eggs Benny, cheese, spotted cow beer, vanilla malt, mango smoothie, empanadas. So much food!  And the tour guide Lynn was very friendly, knowledgable and patient."}
{"text":"Madison  Lake to Lake Tour was great! Being new to the city it allowed me to learn a lot about Madison  and try some fantastic restaurants!"}
{"text":"We've visited Madison before but never took this tour. Now I'm sorry we didn't schedule both tours. The Monroe St. food tour was informative and the food was interesting and delicious. Our guide, Kyle, was great! He was a great speaker, very knowledgeable about the history of the area and a fun guide. I would highly recommend this tour. The food was great and the people at the restaurants and stores were very welcoming to the tour group. We're headed back to Monroe St. tomorrow for some more eating and shopping on our own. Can't wait to come back to Madison to take the other tour. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a great time on the Happy Hour tour with our guide, Erica. Not only did we get to sample some great food and enjoy delicious drinks, but we also got to learn a bit more about the city we call home. I loved learning about the neighborhoods around the Capitol that I walk through each day - it really made me look at Madison in a new way. The tour had just enough food and drink for a happy hour. I would definitely recommend to people looking for a fun and unique way to spend a Friday evening!"}
{"text":"Great time a must do when in Madison, WI .   Learned so much about the growth of Madison while getting a nice variety of foods along the way. Andrea Hughes is a super tour guide. Come hungry you will experience everything from a Pork Belly Torta , Mac and Cheese pizza (5stars as well wouldn't think so) to the simple Vanilla Malt. Give it a try sometime."}
