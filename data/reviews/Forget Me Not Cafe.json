{"text":"Wonderful place tucked away on Adelaide West, seems small when you enter, but has some great space in the back to relax. It has a very cozy feel to it and is well decorated, ideal for a relax working spot. Although it was a bit warm when I was here.  Half coffee shop, half kitchen/house store. You only get one selection of coffee (columbian). Unfortunately, the Batista wasn't very knowledgeable and wasn't able to tell me if if the beans were from a single origin. Espresso was good, not outstanding."}
{"text":"Have driven past this place for over a year and finally made my first visit today! Cutest little cafe. The front of the cafe is quaint and cozy, boosting some lovely kitchen & misc house ware items for sale. As you make you're way through the cafe there is another area showcasing various items and then additional small tables in a semi-private room. I can see it being a really good spot for meeting a study group or something of that nature. The menu is small, with the focus on speciality lattes. I indulged in a Nutella latte and it was delicious. I think I'll try the toasted almond latte next! I also grabbed a peanut butter cookie and it was the perfect amount of soft and crunchy. I'm glad I finally got to check this place out and look forward to my next visit :)"}
{"text":"Unique is all I can say. If you are ever looking for a one of a kind , special gift for yourself or someone close they will definitely have it here. Everything from dining ware that is gold rimmed ,delicate spoons and dishes to speciality linens. Oh I can't forget the fragrant soaps and candles. And then when your done shopping you can sit in the many cozy nooks with a hot chocolate ,inhale their delicious homemade empanadas and lick the plate clean of the churri sauce.  This is such a beautiful quiet gem in Toronto. :)"}
{"text":"The decor is clean, the chairs and tables are perfectly mismatched, and in addition to being a cafe, they also sell small housewares and other little artsy things made of fabric in the back.  The guy working at the counter was very pleasant and made small talk as he prepared my coffee, which was very good. What was great, however, was the chicken empanada that I had with it which was even served with homemade chimichurri (an argentinian sauce with oil, parsley, and garlic). They also had some good looking sandwiches which perhaps I'll try next time along with a slightly fancier coffee rather than my usual Americano.   I like the fact that they don't use disposable stir sticks or sugar packages. They reduce their environmental impact by having spoons and a sugar jar."}
{"text":"Best of Viet Restaurant Ive ever tried in Toronto. Private space, modern decoration, good service and freaking delicious food"}
{"text":"Beautifully curated boutique. Unique houseware and some clothing/bedding in the back. I'm more of a browser here and bought some stationary. Great gift shop and good coffee. Nice to stop for a coffee and snack (just tried the coffee).   Friendly as well."}
{"text":"I was expecting your typical Vietnamese restaurant but it was a lot better than expected. The food was flavorful and the service was good!"}
{"text":"The staff is great . The establishment is welcoming and clean. The pho is delicious :)  5/5 on everything"}
{"text":"La Merceria is a cute Argentinean coffee shop, with a house-wares-and-kick-knack boutique folded in. Done up in whites and woods, this is a pretty space, with lots of things to buy. Grabbed a cappuccino that came with a cookie to nibble on. Lovely space to chill in. Would return to check out the rest of the goods."}
{"text":"Great tasting Vietnamese food!  Would definitely came back here if I was in the neighbourhood.    Service is very accommodating and friendly!   They are attuned to details.  E.g. They offered us a pair of scissors to cut the (long) pho noodles without us asking.  Extra points for that!  The only con is that, they need to work on how to expedite the food. Do not expect all your food to arrive around at the same time, .. It seems confusing  why our rice dish came way after the other tables who had ordered the same dish but they had submitted their orders after us.   And then our pho noodle soup came after we had finished our rice dish.  XL pho, plate of lemongrass chicken/pork chop on rice, and mixed veggies came out to $31 (included tax).  **The mixed veggies was very fresh and crisp.  The portion was a bit small for the price $9... Though tasty."}
{"text":"Oh, man, it's like time stops when you step in here.  All the quiet little tables and the careful, methodical staff (watching the guy who made my iced mocha was an exercise in meditation) make me feel like I'm exactly where I need to be.  Each room of the shop is filled with lovely home goods like high-end natural cleaners and silkscreened towels, but each room also has neat little tables tucked against the walls so you can have a private, cozy lunch with a friend.  What a wonderful find!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the very relaxing atmosphere. The waitress was pleasant and helpful with the menu. She helped us choose three dishes: Pad Thai, cashew chicken rice and calamari; it was delicious! Big potions and reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Cute place. I would never have known about it had it not been mentioned in a WSJ article, recommended by some insider or another.   I am a huge fan of anything Argentine, so of course we braved Saturday afternoon traffic and drove over. It is in an unlikely little block south of Queen, non-descript, which is fine.   Good cup of tea, tried an empanada and browsed the merchandise. The owners obviously have a good eye for curating tabletop items, glassware, candles, etc.. However, I was surpirsed not to see any Argentine items. Not expecting a souvenir shop, but maybe some pieces of alpaca silver, horn vases, textiles or even a pot of dulce de leche.   Nontheless, it is sweet place -- very Queen West in feel -- and a nice alternative to Duflett (which I do like also)."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe. Not very spacious, but cozy. Rustic decor. Kind, thoughtful owner. Air conditioning isn't on during the summer I'm assuming. Good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Just purely delicious! Best Vietnamese food I've  ever had! This place is a must if you want great service. Great food. And great spring rolls. Just go!"}
{"text":"A cute cafe nestled away on Adelaide and Portland that's perfect for studying/working! The menu is sweet and short and the owner is really nice. There are outlets at almost every table so you don't have to worry about your laptop or phone dying if you're camping there for the day."}
{"text":"Well presented, modern and very clean restaurant with friendly staff. Doesn't look much from outside but definitely worth venturing in. The spring rolls were delicious and the chicken course I had was so flavourful and delicious. Reassuring to see the local cops stopping in for their regular pick up and gushing over the food - they eat out so much when they are on the go, I always take that as a good sign!  Little more expensive than some similar places, but you are paying for the quality and nice environment, which I definitely think is worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, value and service. We had the fried spring rolls, fresh rolls, cashew chicken and rice and bun with grilled pork and ground pork sausage. The food was definitely one of the best Vietnamese I have had in North America. Haven't been to Vietnam yet so can't comment."}
{"text":"Adorably cozy setting that's great for studying and socializing due to the partitions. Highly recommend the coconut latte if you like your drinks sweet and creamy."}
{"text":"Wonderful little spot to have a quiet coffee with a friend or solo. Basically they have turned the main floor of a house into a coffee house/gift shop without even tearing down walls, which makes it very quiet and intimate. They have cute little finds for gifts for the difficult to buy for, and yummy snacks!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is exceptional.  There's a pleasantly surprising amount of seating in this seemingly tiny cafe. I got the cafe carmaleo and a beef empanada for just under $7.00.  The cafe carmaleo was almost too beautiful to drink! Sadly it was not delicious as it was beautiful, it could have used more dulce de leche.  The beef empanada was small albeit filling and it was accompanied by what I could make out to be a really tasty pesto sauce.   I'm definitely planning on revisiting this cafe."}
{"text":"I find this cute, clean and modern Vietnamese joint by browsing Yelp on my way to Yorkdale so decided to give it a try.  The experiment turned out to be pleasant.  Bun bo hue tastes very authentic and the flavor is well balanced.  Right amount of shrimp paste which doesn't overpower the broth, and the ingredients used are very fresh.  The portion is also sufficient with right amount of protein.  Spring roll is crispy and tastes delicious.  The decor is chic, comfy and modern.  Washroom is also clean unlike some Vietnamese places.  The service here is friendly and efficient.  I am just surprised the place isn't very busy during weekend lunch hour.  Also came here to try pho and chau tom and the experience so far has been consistently pleasant."}
{"text":"We love popping in this lovely mashup of a cafe and home goods store.  Think anthropologie meets Argentinian food.   The store part has lovely objets d'art , darling dresses and accessories, and other wonderful things. The cafe part is what really draws us in.  Everything is homemade which means that it tastes delicious.  We've tried their hot chocolate, lattes, lemonade, iced tea, and coffee.  Each drink is hand crafted and the service is fantastic.  The empanadas are simply delicious and very filling. This is definitely a gem in the city."}
{"text":"First and foremost: this is the cleanest pho place I've been to in Toronto (and surrounding areas). The ingredients are all fresh, the meat is great, and the flavours are so balanced. I got the thai hot and sour pho with beef and my husband got the classic beef pho. The broths were so clear and the perfect temperature. The noodles were fresh and I can't stress enough that the meat was of great quality, especially when compared to other pho places.   The service was also great. Seems like a family/friends run business. There are comfortable booths and tables to accommodate small and large groups. The decor is modern and the place was so clean! I know I keep saying that but most pho places have a smell and an overall stickiness to them that this place doesn't have. Just made the whole experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Their air conditioner was not on, so it was very hot and humid. It was a small place and there were many items or decorations, so the place looked crowded. They did not have so many seats. The barista and other customers glared at me because it was my first time to go there. Maybe those customers are regulars, so they do not welcome when the place is crowded."}
{"text":"It's very very close by my house. Like literally 2 min away.It has yummy cold roll with bbq sausage. It just make me droll thinking about it. Pho is not too bad. but I think the customer service is top notch unlike most viet restaurant. They have rare and kinda weird food. lol"}
{"text":"Located in a ghetto plaza on Wilson but place is nice when you get inside. Waitress was nice and friendly. Service was good. I ordered rice with pork chops and steamed egg. It was delicious and the pork chop had a good ratio of flavor. We had spring rolls for an appetizer and it was good, crispy the way I like it. My girl, had Bun Bo Hue and she enjoyed it. Spicy and a good amount of flavor. All in all, I would recommend and return. Just note that prices are slightly higher than usual Pho restaurants but a small price to pay for a pleasant atmosphere and good food"}
{"text":"Love the little place. Quite and calm. A great place to spend a whole afternoon reading and relaxing.  Had cappuccino. It was good."}
{"text":"Great little coffee spot! Went in here one day on the way to work. I asked for their most popular drink...  a Nutella latte. Yes it was as good as it sounds. A scoop of Nutella in the bottom with a delicious latte poured over it. Couldn't have one every day but it was such a nice treat on a day that required a pick me up!   Super adorable decor, very chic,  and bright and lovely.  They also sell little kitchen gadgets.    Their breakfast goodies also looked super yummy and there was a great variety.   Staff were friendly and quick and no crazy line ups like some of the mainstream coffee joints.  Support local business!  Try this place next time you're needing a caffeine fix.  Will definitely being going back!"}
{"text":"In love!   Looking tres petit from the outside, this cafe is a coffee & trinket-lover and/or freelancer's haven. Great coffee, great-looking treats on offer and full walls of all the cutest cards, gift items, etc.   I've been in a couple times to hunker down for a few hours of work. Each time I was able to find a table to myself in at least one of the few nooks. This would be a great place to have a meeting, or a workday alongside a friend or two. There are no rushy vibes, and the rooms flow naturally. Every patrons has seemed very nice and respectful of the space & others around them.   GOOD WIFI."}
{"text":"Went when they first open, got served shredded pork that smelled expired and sour. Never went back."}
{"text":"Walked out after staff member did not even acknowledge that I was waiting.. Waited 5 mins while he made coffee without even a smile, \"I'll be with you in a moment\" or nothing..  Poor customer service.. I won't be back and will tell others to avoid."}
{"text":"A mediocre pho restaurant. I had the regular pho special and the broth was very light, the soup wasn't really there. I had to add a bit more sirarcha then usually to add a bit more flavour. This pricing is just about the same for any other pho restaurants around the area that has much better flavoring.  Other than that, the friend wonton was delicious. Would order again though.  Staffs are super friendly, and their service is excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday morning on my way to the train station. Cute young blonde girl was working. She let me use the wifi to figure out where my uber was and didn't force me to buy anything.   Got a cold brew and a spinach empanada. Cold brew was amazing. Empanada was kind of bland. Needed sauce or something but I was on the go.   Decor is cute and bathroom is clean, well decorated, etc."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had! Owners are great people and great service. Try the P6 best one there."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was pretty good! It's very clean and nice modern ambiance. Better than average food presentation. Ever so slightly more expensive than an average pho restaurant. Overall, I wasn't wow'ed enough for my to leave my go-to spots, but definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Either the new barista is no good or the coffee has changed but the smooth tasting cappuccinos have gone to bitter."}
{"text":"Needed a quick and clean pho in the area.  Our usual place isn't in the safest of locations when the sunsets so we found Forget Me Not on Yelp.  It was very clean inside and spacious.  The prices were very reasonable and the staff was very friendly.  I got an XL pho to share with my child and it was enough.  My husband got the spicy pho, I don't know how to spell the name out but he kept saying its the best he's had of that type.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Really great value, pricing and quality are on point! I was in the Yorkdale area and stopped by for some vermicelli. The prices are really good ($8 + $1 for any additional toppings), cheaper than other places which usually charge around $10-12. The dish was tasty and the service was fast. We also ordered the cold rice-paper rolls which were pretty good too. I would come back if I'm in the area. Wish it was closer to home for me!"}
{"text":"I went for the second time and the food was not the same as the last. I had the vermicelli with grilled pork and chicken and sadly one of the meats was not freshly cooked but reheated and warmed so it was dried out and crispy. My dining companion had rare beef pho and was not impressed, they advised taste of broth was one-dimensional and not as flavourful as others they have had. Lastly, the fried wontons were so overdone that the filing was hard, the only saving grace was that the outside was crispy. What a disappointment, the first time I went the food was great. Our server was great and that was the only plus."}
{"text":"Just had Pho for lunch... Really quite good... Tasty broth, plenty of everything in the large size. Glad I gave it a shot based of my fellow Yelpers recommendations ... Thanks Yelpers :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite Vietnamese restaurant!! The chicken pho and grilled chicken and rice are delicious. Staff is soo friendly and family run! I  work around the corner and I literally come here at least twice a week - that's not an exaggeration! Highly recommended! Also try the beef stew *drool*"}
{"text":"\"Hidden away from the busy streets of the city, this little place is a comfort from our busy schedules\"  The place itself is a cozy coffee shop and enjoying a nice snack and coffee set your heart and stomach with ease. The different gifts along the wall made the place unique with a distant feel of warmth from kitchenware to soaps, and the little jewelry to cards. The different decorations gives a nice countryside vintage coffee shop feel.  The coffee and the empanada are definitely quite tasteful. Their different latte is must try. For a nice bite and escape from the busy streets, enter here and you will feel your mind is in tranquil. The vintage tables and chairs and the scent of coffee is definitely a place everyone should come by and take your mind off things."}
{"text":"Okay but had better pho in the area.  Sizing is good but the broth could get a little work.  Not as tasty as many place I tried.  Not sure I will be back.  Def overrated by many yelpers.  There is also limited parking as it is located in a strip plaza.  Place is fairly clean and staff was friendly but I didn't like my pho too much so only 3 stars.  Spring rolls were pretty good at least."}
{"text":"This is an odd space for a cafe/shop. While it does well as a shop it falters as a cafe.  The setup is just weird with a lot of tight steps and odd corner spaces being used as seating. On top of this one has a hard time figuring out where the seating ends and display begins. Ah well I will let the space savers among you figure this out.  My friend ordered a chicken empenada. While the taste was decent there were a few pieces of cartilage in them. Hmm unappetizing to say the least. Here is the verdict on the cappuccino  Espresso: Medium Crema': OK Milk: Frothed average Latte Art: n/a I would say a very mundane take on cappuccino.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Menu is pretty extensive and the dishes we ordered came out fairly quickly. Favourite dish is the vermicelli noodle with grilled pork and spring rolls. Viet coffee here is bomb. Waitresses are polite and knowledgeable about the menu. Prices are good for the portion."}
{"text":"I liked this place - not your run of the mill Cafe. Really great Argentinian treats to be had (a welcome change from the usual grilled sandwich fare) along with well made beverages poured by a pleasant staff. Sat and worked on my laptop and sipped a very refreshing hot apple cider on a chilly Toronto day. The veggie mushroom asparagus pie dish I ate was delicious."}
{"text":"I used to live in Argentina. This cafe reminds me why I loved that place. Yummy treats, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier with this coffee shop. Not only am I able to get myself a delightful cup of coffee but I'm also able to do my gift shopping here. From glassware to cards to linens, they have something for everyone.   The atmosphere is quaint and the people are friendly.   The fresh Empanadas are so amazing and their Hot chocolate is made with..wait for it.. REAL CHOCOLATE chunks. none of that powdered liquid crap.   There are not enough words in the dictionary to describe my utter joy for this place. It has and forever will be my morning pit stop on the way to ... well anywhere."}
{"text":"Lovely little cafe that's tucked in downtown. I find it super cozy and charming! Lovely seating options with cushioned benches and decor that makes you feel like you are home enjoying a coffee in your living room. Man who runs the show is very kind and welcoming. There is also a variety of options to pair with your coffee whether it's savoury or sweet they've got it!"}
{"text":"Cuuuuuuuuuute.  And I don't just mean the guys behind the counter.  Really quaint.  We sat at the table and eat had a large iced americano (REALLY big) and my friend had a quiche thing.  She said it was quite good.  Good atmosphere, tasty coffee."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Great place for authentic pho and rice dishes. Their grilled porkchops are very flavourful and moist. The broth for their pho is clean tasting.  Definitely recommend this place if you're around the area."}
{"text":"Really cute cafe shop with lovely decor. This cafe has a nice cozy feeling and is great to just sit and chat or to do some work. I tried the curry lentil soup and it's really amazing. It doesn't have an overly strong curry punch, but is instead very smooth and well-rounded. I would defiantly come here again for the great ambience and food!"}
{"text":"This is my go to. Everything I've had thus far has been exceptional. The spring rolls crisp and flaky, the pho broth flavourful and the meat extremely tender, and my fave B10 is fresh and tasty.  This place is a hidden gem and as much as I want to keep this place to myself it would be a disservice to anyone looking for a great pho spot.   Also, I have to say the service is top notch. Always friendly and welcoming.  I would give it 5 stars if it was in a better location."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to my house!   It doesn't look like much from the outside or inside to be honest since this cafe is a remodeled house and converted into a coffee place. As other reviewers have noted, the space is a bit cramped and depending how busy it is, seating might not be available. Inside, this place carries a wide range of items from local artisans and trinkets besides hot and cold beverages, pastries and snacks.  However, for us, this place works as you can have a quiet conversation or you might be listening in on a conversation as you are more than likely to be sharing space with other people. We don't mind. Plus they have free WiFi available.  We had their coffee, hot chocolate, croissant and chicken empanada and no complaints from us in regards to their drinks or food. Their stuff is decent. Prices are reasonable especially in the area.  This will be a must stop for us when we are in the King Street West area!  #42 of 2018"}
{"text":"My family still loves this place. The dishes are still solid, prices are reasonable and service is good for the most part.   We came for dinner around 6:30pm today and it wasn't busy at all. We were the only customers during our meal which we found a little worrisome in regards to their business. I hope it was just a slow day.   We ordered the Cashew Chicken with Rice, the Broken Rice with Pork, Chicken and fried egg and the Pho with Rare Beef and Tripe.   We enjoyed our meal tremendously.  #56 of 2018"}
{"text":"This is a bright, sunny place to get a fantastic hot beverage. I have always enjoyed my orders, in particular the mocha (with real chocolate!), and the cafe carmaleo (with real dulche de leche)!  No flavour syrups here!   Very nice houseware-type stuff available for purchase, but its not cheap!  This is one of my favourite cafe's in the hood!"}
{"text":"Service could be a bit more friendly, other than that, I love this place for its cozy atmosphere and their iced hazelnut latte!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee shops in the city with lovely atmosphere and neat items (for sale). It is relaxing in the summer and cozy in the winter. Service is excellent and all beverages are made with care. The espresso here is more of a medium roast with a hint of bitterness, great with a little bit of honey."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents recently. The best way for me to describe Forget Me Not Café is that it is a Vietnamese Restaurant that is very Westernized in decor, cleanliness and service, but still authentic in its food. We enjoyed it.  I had the My Tho Noodle Soup (My Tho is a small town in Vietnam). It only comes in one size (large) and is $8. The noodles are tapioca noodles, which I love. They were chewy and awesome. The soup also came with 2 medium sized shrimp, a few pieces of imitation crab, a few pieces of fish balls, 3 pieces of overly chewy squid, a few pieces of BBQ pork and a tiny bit of ground pork. It had too much bean sprouts for my liking and not enough bok choy (there was 1 piece of the latter). The soup wasn't overly salty nor overly oily, but it did lack depthness of flavour. It was good, but not wow. However, for the price it was a great deal.  My parents both had the Special Pho. My mom had the small $6 and my dad had the large $8. They both felt it was good, but the tripe was too chewy. However, the tendon was soft and other meats were good. The broth was fragrant, but my mom felt that the beef flavour was overwhelming (too beefy in a gamey way).  We started off with spring rolls $4.50. You only get 2 per order, but they are fairly large. I love the fact that they use rice paper for the wrapper instead of the usual wheat-based wrapper you find at other restaurants. The spring rolls were super crispy, which I liked. They also contained taro, which I also liked. However, they did not contain all that much meat (if any). It was mostly carrots and onions.  The restaurant is very clean, including the washrooms. The decor is modern with some cozy booths. Service was really nice and friendly.   The parking lot is terrible. Even though it's a strip mall, there are not a lot of parking spots and it's difficult to get in and out because there's regular row parking but then there are spots for cars to park perpendicular to the rows, and they are relatively close.  Clean restaurant, cheap prices, nice service and good food - I'm a fan of all the above."}
{"text":"Had the special pho and beef stew soup with crispy cracker chicken fresh rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious. The restaurant is very clean and service is good. The booth seats have call buttons to ring the waitresses."}
{"text":"THE BEST PHO I'VE HAD in a very long time, even compared to pho hung, pho88, and pho Pasteur. The difference really is the savoury and delicious broth, and also the quality and amount of meat in the pho. I want always get the Pho Special that has everything in it, and the beef balls are the high quality ones with tendon in them, not the cheaper all ground ones most other places have.   The service is also pleasant and it's always full during lunch, the pho is the best thing you can get here! And always ask for cooked sprouts, that way you don't have to wait to eat them once you put them in the broth!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a space to chill. This is your spot. It's set up unlike most coffee shops. It's part retail, part coffee. All in a small space, divided into small rooms, with tiny tables. The space feels big, but there actually aren't many seats. The rooms feel like little hideaways that make it easy to focus.   Considering the area, this is probably the most comfortable place you will find, to sit quietly and write, or catch up with friends."}
{"text":"We have paid a visit to Forget-Me-Not on the monthly since discovering it a while back. Don't let the dinky plaza it is located in deter you, this place is clean, service is fast and great and the food does not disappoint!  Our go-to is either the spring roll/rice paper roll, and bun rieu (crab meat in tomato broth)/beef noodle soup (not pho, but trust, these are amazing). Ensure to spice everything up with some chili or hot sauce. Only blemish was that the bun bo hue was not as flavourful as expected.   However, all in for under 25 - this is a total winner!"}
{"text":"What a lovely little spot!  I've been here a few times and it's great for studying or getting some work done - especially the two rooms in the back. The man at the coffee bar is always so pleasant to deal with. The drinks are great, and I quite like their empanadas. I typically go for americanos, but I did try a cappuccino last time, which really hit the spot!  Generally, there are people working on laptops so it's pretty quiet. The separated rooms makes it seem so cozy and personally helps me focus. Although the last time, there was a group of girls that were super loud...ugh.   Aside from coffee and the lovely ambience, there are lots of neat items for sale by small artists, which really adds to the intimacy of this place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem - I found this restaurant through Yelp and gave it a shot from the high reviews.  I've tried their pho, bun bo hue that was very authentic, beef jerky salad that was ok I found the salad dressing a bit too sour, beef and chicken rice the BBQ meats were very delicious.   The food is quite authentic but the one thing that was upsetting was we drove here few weeks ago on a Wednesday and they were not open.  There was no sign indicating of any reasons.  It was an inconvenience since we went out of our way wanting to eat there."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this cafe on a hot summer's day and am so happy I went in. This adorable little shop in conveniently located between King and Queen off of Portland. Although there are a ton of coffee and cafe options in the area, Forget Me Not is simple and relaxing.  This quaint cafe is run by an extremely friendly and adorable man and is filled with cute gems for purchase. Definitely check this cafe out if you're looking to escape the typical madness in the entertainment district.  Did I mention there's a ton of space to sit down and set up for the day?"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Super cozy, beautiful decor, friendly staff and most importantly delicious drinks and pastries.   I went later in the morning and there was plenty of space to sit, plus the wifi was plenty strong for all of the emailing and Slack messaging I was doing.   Can't wait to come back and work from here again, and slowly (but surely) make my way through all of their pastries. The chocolate croissant looks particularly delicious."}
{"text":"The best coffee we ever had beautiful place convenient and had a great experience  Over all 5 stars"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. And I have tried quite a few Vietnamese restaurants in North York. I can't speak to authenticity but IMHO this is the only one that is consistent both in their food taste and service, especially after I had some horrible experience at other joints where they served chicken that was unable to chew and charged a hefty price. And the place feels clean every time I am here. Nice atmosphere too.   The only downside can be the parking. Other than that I will highly recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews for this place we finally made it to Pho land.  Forget me not cafe was definitely not easily forgettable.   We ordered a combo with grilled chicken and pork chop. The dish came with white rice and a broth on the side. The dish reminded me of street side Singapore chicken and rice. The quality of the meats was excellent. Both, the chicken and the pork chop were immaculately marinated and cooked. The sweet teriyaki resembling glaze on the meats was delicious.   The pho is what we came here for, and it didn't disappoint. For me, large was too much quantity. The broth was flavourful. Since we ordered the special, it had a variety of ingredients and meats. The meatballs were delicious. Definitely recommend the Special Pho.   The servers were cheerful and friendly as well. That's always a big plus in any dining experience. Nice restaurant, will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Ordered the com bi. Really enjoyed the option to choose your sides and also being able to add more sides!  But!  Right off the bat, they lose a star for the small amount of \"bi\"  or the shredded pork given to you,compared to other Viet restaurants. Also the nuoc mum wasn't very good. Maybe an off day but thought it was quite bland.   Other people in my party ordered the duck noodle soup, they said it was pretty good. And the cashew chicken was ordered, no surprise, very nutty! Peanut butter based sauce, I liked it.   Interior was nice (for the area)  and service was pretty friendly although the worker's kids were there just hanging out in one of the booths.   Did not try the Vietnamese coffee.  It smelt fantastic.  I would overall give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend and ordered two things off the menu :  Bho Kho and the vermicelli dish with with pork roll (nem nuong) and spring roll.  The bho kho was good, different from what I'm used to but still good nonetheless. I really liked the spring roll in the vermicelli dish but the nem nuong wasn't my favourite.   The service was great! Staff were very friendly and nice and the restaurant was clean.   I would come here again to try other things on the menu if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"I go here pretty often... they have the absolute best pho in Toronto (broth is so delicious) and as a non-salad eater, I really enjoy their mango/papaya salad made with shrimp and chicken/pork. You even get shrimp crackers when ordering the shrimp mango one along with these little fried onion pieces.   Prices are great for the portion you get. I feel like this is a huge step up from other Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA. Both in quality of the food and the service! Usually other similar restaurants are very rushy and will slam the tea at your table, here they take time to say hi and welcome you. The owners seem to be a Vietnamese family, and what they cook are both delicious and very authentic.  Next time you shop at Yorkdale and get hungry/hangry, come here. It may look like a normal sorta shabby strip plaza, but trust me, it is nice and modern inside the restaurant with food that will keep you coming back for more. I like that they also have several TVs so sometimes I would come here to eat while the Raptors are playing. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the cutest and coziest cafe in Toronto. the food, the drinks and the ambiance is amazing. The decor is adorable. The barista/owner(?) is very kind. The prices are great too. What else can i ask for?"}
{"text":"I was in the west end on a late Friday afternoon and I decided to drop by Forget Me Not Cafe for some Vietnamese food. Forget Me Not Cafe is a Vietnamese restaurant located in a small strip plaza on Wilson Ave in the west end of Toronto.  The place wasn't that busy since it was a late afternoon in between lunch and dinnertime. I was quickly seated and given a menu and some tea. I looked through the menu and decided to get a large special beef noodle soup ($8.00 plus tax) and two deep fried spring rolls ($4.50 plus tax). The menu was fairly extensive and covered a lot of Vietnamese dishes other than your basic pho, vermicelli and rice dishes.The deep fried spring rolls were really good. Outside was nice and crispy but not overdone. The inside had the right amount of filling including taro. The large beef noodle soup was good but not great. Noodles were perfectly cooked, nice thin slices of beef, along with tripe, tendon and beef balls. The broth was pretty good but the only issue I had is when you make pho, a little bit of msg is used but they were a little heavy with the msg and I was quite thirsty afterwards.  Forget Me Not Cafe is a pretty good option for authentic Vietnamese food in the west end, the food is probably a little bit more expensive than it's competitors for some dishes but not by much, it's still reasonably priced. The service is pretty friendly and helpful which isn't that common for a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. Also, it's probably the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant you will ever go to, dining room and washrooms."}
{"text":"My husband and I went shopping at yorkdale, and were looking for someplace nearby to have dinner. Came across Forget me not cafe on yelp with fairly decent reviews, so we thought we gave it a try and we are so glad we did! I ordered the shrimp and crab udon, and my husband ordered stew beef egg noodles. We loved both of our dishes! The portions were very generous and total came out to under $20! We would love to come back the next time we are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Came here last night.  I'd rate it A-OK for a few reasons. First, prices for all of the dishes are higher than average for a viet restaurant. Second, the Sour Sop milkshake wasn't that great - it was more milky than usual and was missing the tangy taste of the fruit.  This place is above average in its decor compared to other viet restaurants.  Thus, all-in-all I would rather go to a viet place with cheaper prices and a better sour sop milkshake rather than have the nice decor at this place."}
{"text":"If I could rate this less than a 1 star I would ... worst food... worst experience ... worst service. I've been sick off the food for almost 3 hours. Will never ever go back. Avoid!"}
{"text":"I work in the Keele and Wilson area where there are numerous Vietnamese and Thai restaurants, but this one is by far the best! You would never tell by the name what kind of restaurant this is.  The food is great, the place is clean and modern, the the service is very friendly.  They offer a huge menu and everything I tried is great!  The one standout dish for me is the lemongrass and chili chicken.  I could eat this every day.  If you're in the neighborhood, this is your best bet for good Thai and Viet food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most clean Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Toronto.  I have been here a handful of times for the past 2-3 years.   The value-for-money (VFM) winner here is their special pho (comes in SML sizes). It includes all the typical variety of ingredients; rare beef, beef ball, tripe, and beef tendon.  The soup was flavourful and hot (temperature wise)."}
{"text":"We could definitely use more cafes like this one in Toronto!  Hipster, it ain't.  Instead it's a quaint, cute, Argentinian-inspired cafe.  Nestled among a bunch of cute homegoods (napkins, plates, notebooks, etc.) is the cafe bar.  They serve Colombian beans with a wide-variety of 'fancy drinks', including lattes with caramel, nutella, dolce de lece.  Being a bit purist of a dieting-dude, I had their standard latte and enjoyed it.  I do like the added touch of having a small butter cookie with each cup of coffee - nothing wrong with that.   You can enjoy your coffee in a bunch of different spaces.  There are couches in the back, a side room with small tables and the front room with bistro round tables.  Pick your mood and nestle in."}
{"text":"My rating is a 3.5 but I'll bump them up to a 4 star.  Forget Me Not is actually nicely furnished with TVs, unlike the typical Viet places.  I had curry beef with french bread and it was quite good, the curry tasted authentic but unfortunately took quite a while for a food to come. It may have because it was off hours around 3pm and the cook wasn't in the groove however when going to a Viet restaurant we expect somewhat quick turnaround time on meals.   Anyway may give this place another try if I have some extra time to kill."}
{"text":"Always my go-to comfort food spot. Noodles, warm soup, crunchy springrolls = best combination to combat a cold night.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I always come by this cafe when I'm in the neighbourhood! It is especially nice to do work in the back on my laptop (free wi-fi!). It's quaint, cozy and peaceful, although they do usually have the radio playing pop music and I wish it were a bit more quiet sometimes.   Pricing is kind of expensive here though. My hazelnut latte was I believe around $5 and my caramel latte ended up being $5.90. Both were pretty okay-good but I don't know much about lattes."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in the city. Clean restaurant, like the bathroom is shiny and the tables and chairs are clean. It's such a pleasure eating here. Really really great service. You want to know anything and someone will happily explain it to you. Delicious pho, the meat is fresh and perfectly served and the broth is the best broth I've ever tried anywhere else. You will never dine in another pho place as great as this hands down all around perfect."}
{"text":"Bae and I found this little gem thanks to Yelp - YAY!  We stopped in on a blistery cold weekend afternoon for some much needed hot food. The place was very busy for the random hour we stopped in at (believe it was 2 or 3 in the afternoon) so that was already a good sign.  I opted for the veggie pho and bae selected the dish that comes with vermicelli noodles plus grilled meats and veggies (so sorry I forget the name!).   The soup was so so good. Super comforting and very flavourful. Bae enjoyed his meal as well.  Want to come back again very soon!!"}
{"text":"Interesting hybrid of housewares and cafe. I had a couple of okay empinadas and one delicious cookie. Had the drip coffee for once (instead of my usual espresso), and it was also pretty decent. I see myself coming back here to try out some of their other stuff, and maybe upgrade my rating."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, we visited again on 09 March 2018 and we were not disappointed.  The food is always great here, great service and no complaints."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9.5/10 Drink: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Value: 9/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 9/10  We were searching for somewhere quick to go for food before volleyball and stumbled upon this little gem. It's in a little plaza, and definitely doesn't stand out, but WOW, what a find!  For a starter, I had the salad rolls, they were prepared immediately and all the ingredients were fresh. The house special pho had a flavourful broth, it was very light and free of heavy MSG flavour. The avocado shake was great and flavourful, just the right amount of sweetness.  The cost is typical of Vietnamese food around $7-8/entree. The quality and portions are great.   It has a very chic feel, kind of like a modern restaurant in Paris. It has mostly booths, but there are some tables that they can bring together for larger groups.  The service here was very friendly and they were attentive and prompt.   A great place for Vietnamese food, and the flavours are great. I would definitely recommend this place. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Went to visit my friend on Queen Street West and we decided to head over to a nearby coffee shop to catch up!!  This place looks very tiny from the outside, but once you step in, there are more tables at the two rooms down the hallway.  Decorations is very cafe shop like, very cozy and relaxing.  They serve numerous selection of coffee/lattes and pastries!  I ordered a Hazelnut Latte and my friend ordered an Americano and a green tea cookie!  My hazelnut latte was so smooth and the sweetest was just right and I really enjoyed the latte.  The green tea cookie itself, although soft, but the matcha taste is not strong enough.  4 stars for Le Merceria (aka Forget Me Not Cafe?), wonderful environment and delicious coffee!  I will try other pastries next time and if they impress me, I may give this place the last missing star."}
{"text":"Love their London Fog and the Empanadas with the homemade salsa is amazing!! I come here every morning before work."}
{"text":"Forget me not cafe...My now favourite birthday drink place!! We stumbled on this cafe before my birthday dinner as we were an hour early for our reservation. I am so glad that we found this place. It is such a cute and quaint coffee house. The owner is Korean from what I recall and other than the usual coffees, lattes, cappuccinos and teas, they also created new flavours and interesting blends of tea. I tried their iced nutella latte as it was recommended from their sign outside and of course from the owner. I am not a fan of sweet drinks and I was a bit skeptical on this one but the owner made the drink just right after I expressed my concern. It was so yummy and satisfying! My husband who is not a coffee drinker tried the iced matcha lemon tea and it was quite an unique taste. The lemon and matcha definitely worked well together and I felt like it was an instant detox- aka an healthy but yummy and refreshing. I definitely recommend it if you are not a coffee drinker or want something that is less caffeinated. Again for this drink you can customize the sweetness so not to worry if you think it is one of those sugary drinks.  A few things to note about the cafe is that they have a variety of snacks and baked goods. I did see that Yelpers had recommended the empanadas so we shared the spinach one. It was fluffy and delicious and just the right size to share with someone.  I also really like the space they have in the cafe as there are two spots in the back that are more quiet and private. It is great if you need to study or do some work. The cafe also sells unique jewelry items, soaps, cards and other neat little gifts.   I will be definitely making another visit when I am in the area- what a nice birthday treat...Or should I say an everyday treat...? :)"}
{"text":"This is an adorable, quaint cafe run by an adorable Korean man. There is ample seating (three main seating areas) and free wifi, and I believe it is open until 7:30 pm on most days. I enjoyed the curry lentil soup, drip coffee (surprisingly delicious black), and coconut tea. The matcha shortbread cookie, though highly instagrammable, is unfortunately way too salty and not good. They also have alfajores which look AMAZING. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I enjoy food with no MSG. This pho restaurant's recipes are healthy & very tasteful! The boss is very friendly & servers are very nice. Must try their amazing beef rice roll. It's one of a kind. :)"}
{"text":"A cute, hidden cafe that I've hung out a few times this past year. The entire coffee shop is decked out in vintage furniture with pillows and wooden seating that will make you feel at home. The decor will make you want to spend your weekend afternoons here.   Unfortunately the coffee and food is mediocre. I've ordered the iced coffee before, which was so diluted with water that I had to ask them to refill the cup with more coffee. The coffees are average, with a lot of options for specialty lattes such as the nutella latte. I found the nutella latte to be incredibly sweet and as expected, more of a dessert than a drink. The snacks also seem to be sitting around and simply heated up when you order them.   I've also tried studying here for awhile (there is a more secluded area in the back with less people) but it's difficult to focus here. La Merceria is best for catching up with friends and hanging out but don't expect world class coffee to be served here."}
{"text":"Great vietnamese place. I loved their beef noodle soup and the taste. The service was fast and the food came out in a proper amount of time. Their spring rolls were very good. They also have some interesting meats like bison and kangaroo, but I wasn't feeling that adventurous on my first foray here.   The pho soup base was good. Great for a working lunch and the occasional family meal out."}
{"text":"An odd setup with not the best boutique items around.  Fortunately the coffee and staff is and was GOOD."}
{"text":"Sometimes you ask yourself - what makes a good latte? Whether it is a coffee based, or tea... what elements would satisfy your morning palette? Is it the tea or espresso bean? temperature of the milk? the foam etc......  I feel like I have gotten more picky with having worked at Starbucks, learning about microfoams, coffee art and all those other words that people have gotten all fancy with when it comes to the art of coffee.  Walking into La Merceria, I felt like I had this high expectation (which can be such a bad thing) to get a great drink... maybe it was because of the atmosphere it had - both retail and coffee shop, the place was very chi-chi, I thought anyway. The trinkets and other things on sale were very unique and looked expensive!  On the menu were some decadent selections: condensed milk, dulce de leche... I thought about changing my mind and getting a coffee but I was set on getting a london fog this morning so that was that. The guys at the counter were so nice and friendly, I wish I had more time to chat it up with them. Their teas are from tealish, which I absolutely have come to fall in love with after tasting them at the One of a Kind Show.   They don't put that much water into the cup (1/3), so I get a good serving of calcium haha.. I hate it when they rip me off on the milk.. and yes they have skiim!  I don't usually like foam, but this was delicious. It was silky smooth and the vanilla syrup they used just absorbed into the whole drink altogether. I like their earl grey because it is not too strong like Starbucks (the bergemont ) and the tea does not become overpowering after being steeped in the cup for an extended period of time.  Now, that review wasn't too picky was it :S"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of buzz about this pho restaurant and had to check it out. This restaurant stands out for the following reasons: - Interior is modern, tables are clean - Excellent service - They check up on you and smile - Traditional Vietnamese dishes.. Not just pho (which is still amazing)!   Next time I need to try their hot pot, looked so good!"}
{"text":"Organized a Baby Shower for my boss and his wife and what a treat it was! Very well managed, great set up and the food was so good!  Sandra and Marcello (the owners) were very professional, yet made sure everthing was taking care of to the T! I would most certainly recommend an event -  bridal shower, baby shower, team building or even if it just a hommade empanada and a coffee, La Merceia is your place!  Stephanie"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant The fish sauce is authentic & the decor is so clean. Service is super friendly!"}
{"text":"It's hard to take this place seriously when you think of pho; I am referring to the name of course. But don't let this ordinary name fool you because this place is pho-nomenal (you see what I just did there? ;) I often make excuses to go shopping in Yorkdale just so I can visit this place and of course Raps. I would dare to say this is probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA in terms of overall quality, value and deliciousness.  The pho is excellent; hot clear broth with great complexity. Combined that with great cuts of beef, fresh herbs and veggies and you pretty much have a winner here. But that's not what I come here for. It's their vermicelli that I crave for all the time! For $8 you can a giant plate of well cooked vermicelli noodles with your choice of 2 sides. And on top of that you can add additional sides for $1 each (max 2). While the value is unbelievable it's the deliciousness that won me over. Perfectly charred pieces of bbq meats packed with flavour, sprinkle some fresh herbs in there and of course be generous with that fish sauce and siracha and you pretty much have the taste of Vietnamese BBQ heaven!  This place also has some exotic stuff if I recalled correctly; alligator meat and such. They also have a variety of stir fry dishes are a little different than most Vietnamese places but damn I just can't get over that vermicelli! LOL  Amazing food, tremendous value and to top it off excellent service (what??!) is what makes this one of the best if not the best Vietnamese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe! Vintage decor has always been my preference but this cafe takes it to another level with a cute home-like feel! Even the bathroom is super homey.   When I came I had the latte as well as the nutella latte. I preferred the nutella one because of the rich texture and choco aroma that adds to the latte itself.   I love the vibe and would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Ordered my coffee through Ritual and the latte was ready right when I got there. The latte was alright though, not the best. Not sure why this place has such a high rating. The place does seem spacious and would be a good place to stay for a log period of time. I wasn't charmed by all the \"vintage\" furniture or decor that everyone talks about..."}
{"text":"Finally, I found the best Vietnamese restaurant in town. The restaurant is very clean and service is 10/10. I had spring roll, grill pork with vermicelli and a small salad. Everything for just $8. Big portion, tasty food and plus, no MSG. Definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service bad management . Went there on Friday afternoon to grab some quick food during my lunch hours .my friends accompanied me . 1st they took a wrong order then they force us to take it .Later the manager talks to us in a bad tone comes up with some stupid policy saying every individual in a group should order separate items and food cannot be shared . This policy was not informed to us nor written anywhere . Too add on food was not fresh at all . We got the food in 2 mins that says it all . Very disappointed would not recommend this place ."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a cute little cafe. And what makes it cute? White-washed decor, baked goods, quaint rooms, and carefully selected household items on display and for sale.  It's simply calming - not an easy feat in this city."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch.  Wontons, pork sausage roll. Enjoyable!  Friendly staff, menu has a number of larger family style dishes."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked away at wilson and dufferin.  Very clean and tidy, furnishings are modern, and is more upscale than most pho restaurants.  Service was great too.  Menu had exotic meats such as crocodile, deer, and boar to name a few.  A must try. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a cute little coffee shop steps from my airbnb! There's wifi, coffee, muffins and even items for sale.   The barista/owner is a sweetheart. He suggested his Iced matcha frappuccino would be better than an Iced Latte I originally ordered and he was right! The ice is blended in the Iced frappuccino compared to just getting a cup of ice cubes with the matcha.   I'm down in supporting local businesses and this one is on my favorite list on my next return!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food and service both were good. It is the first vietnamese restaurant I have ever visited. I can say for sure that i loved the food over here. The quality of meat used was very good. Meat was cooked beautifully. We order grilled chicken and pork chops with rice. Pork chops and chicken was very flavourful. We also ordered their special pho soup. The broth was very flavourful and meatballs in it were very tasty. I think the noodles in it were a little too much for me. The spring rolls were the best i have ever had in canada so far."}
{"text":"I ordered the rice combination dish that has a bit of every kind of protein. It was $10 and the most expensive rice dish. It was simply delicious. My GF ordered the bun bo hue and was not pleased with it. She is real viet and found it lacking in flavor. She loved my rice dish way more. I will return here and try their pho next time!"}
{"text":"Caveat: I can't comment on the coffee because I'm not a coffee drinker. This may be a good place to grab a cup on your way to work.  This place looks super cute from the outside so I happily popped in.  The service seemed nice: I noticed they recognized many people and their orders and they offered to warm my butter tart. Aside from these observations, I can't say I like the place.  I sat by the front near the window and was surprised to feel the chairs wiggle and creak beneath me. I'm fairly small, so I was okay, but it would not surprise me if a heavier man sits down and ends up on the floor. I tried three other chairs and had the same issue. I casually mentioned this to the fellow behind the counter and his response was, \"a napkin? Do you need a napkin?\" I was confused and reiterated that the chairs seemed a bit rickety... He again offered napkins to resolve the issue. ..Maybe to put under a leg? I'm unsure. Nice guy, but he left me totally confused!  I had the ham and cheese ____ (... Ahhh shit! I forget what it's called) It was okay. The eggs were so hard I actually mistook them for cheese at first..and I overcook hard-boiled eggs all the time so this is an achievement. The English breakfast tea was yummy.  I will probably never return, but I'm assuming the coffee is amazing based on the other reviews. In terms of cute cafes there are plenty of other places around."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Toronto, both because of the atmosphere as well as the drinks.  It is such a cozy place, when you enter it feels like you're entering a small cute home goods store something. Everything has almost an artsy feel to it and it's warm and welcoming. There are tables in the front, as well as small rooms in the back that have benches with cushions and little reading nooks. Free Wifi so it's a great place to hide and work.   Best cold brew in TO and the price is really good - cheaper than Starbucks. If you have a sweet tooth they have drinks such as the Nutella Latte or Dulce De Leche latte (this one seems to be very popular).  For food the Empenadas are delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing vermacelli, the best in toronto in my opinion. Clean food nice atmosphere. Its always a treat to come here"}
{"text":"We decided to come here because this place got good reviews on chowhound and they serve authentic Vietnamese dishes. We wanted to get the venison tartar but unfortunately, they took it off the menu so we got the beef tartar instead. It's not like the traditional western beef tartar, but rather a bunch of thinly sliced raw beef which was served with pickled radish, carrots and mint. It came with a black sesame cracker to eat it on too which was really good!  We also got the standard pho and a spicy noodle soup. The weird thing was that there were no condiments (eg hoisin sauce, hot sauce) available for us to use but we didn't ask as we thought it was standard.   Overall food is great and would come back! A bit far and in the ghetto but if you plan on shopping at Yorkdale after, might as well stop by."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim (close to Yorkdale). It tasted ok but worse than average. I probably won't be back.   1. Prices are reasonable - $6.5 small, $8 large, $11 extra large 2. They have electric bells at the table (Korean style) but it didn't seem to work when I pressed it... 3. Ordered bun bo hue, it was very oily, beef was over cooked, pork trotter was not flavorful 4. I think there was a lot of MSG because I was extremely thirsty afterward (this doesn't usually happen) 5. Parking may or may not be an  issue - very tight parking, limited spots"}
{"text":"La Merceria was a decent place to pass a quiet afternoon away from the hustle and bustle of the big city.  (Do I sound like an east coast bumpkin yet? Of course I do.)  The calm, bright atmosphere managed to counter the fact that I haven't seen the sun in six weeks and the fact that the entire place feels like someone's house felt more personal than the chrome-and-mirror cafés that I had been in thus far. Every now and then you just don't want to feel like Whitney Houston's about to come get the party started while you're enjoying a latté, amirite?  The empanadas made for a nice, light lunch, the service was friendly-ish but pretty low-key, and the little nooks to sit with some privacy would make it perfect for getting some work done without distractions.  The only real complaint is that the door is hooked up to a little alarm system that sounds whenever it's opened. Over the span of a two hour stay, having a loud BEEEP go off every few minutes was enough to give me an eye-twitch..."}
{"text":"i loved loved loved this cafe! from the antique vibe and casual ambience, it was a lovely place to stop and grab some coffee! i got an iced vanilla latte though i had wanted it with coconut milk but you can only pick one it seems  i asked which muffin of theirs was his favourite and he said the sourdough one and it was delicious! my friend who had gotten the chocolate one took a bite and immediately wanted to switch  the empanadas were also super good, served with a side of what i think is basil and olive oil as a dipping sauce!  the owner was also incredibly nice. my friends and i are a chatty group though it was just three but he found us funny and often laughed and chatted back. he was really nice and i'm going to visit this cafe ten hundred more times!"}
{"text":"A beautiful little place on Adelaide St that has a variety of pastries and delicious drinks. The price isn't expensive at all which is surprising because of the quality of the drinks and service. Have been here four times in one week and I'm always greeted with a smile.   They also sell quaint furniture and kitchenware and even some great smelling candles!  Definitely check it out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"La Merceria is perfection in the form of a cute little Argentenian style espresso bar & home boutique.   I loved it from the moment I walked in. It's small, but in the best, cozy kind of way. Seating comes in the form of small chairs, and larger benches filled with comfy cushions to relax on.  Some of the walls are filled with knick-knacks, home supplies, and assorted items for sale - they have some really neat stuff and its worth at least browsing!  The service is super sweet & friendly. If you want to chill out with some free WIFI, ask one of the workers here for the password and they'll slip you a teeny piece of paper with the goods on it (and make you feel like you're in a spy movie.)  I decided to try their 4oz \"Morocchino\" which was simple but delicious: chocolate, espresso, foam. The bitterness with the espresso worked really well with the chocolate, and I devoured this quite quickly. It's presented on a cute little wooden plate that looks like a chunk of a tree trump, with a complimentary cookie on the side - super adorable.  They have a variety of baked goods, sandwiches, and empanadas, so I decided to try the ham & cheese empanada. Mmmmmm. The empanada dough was fluffy and fresh, and this was simply some awesome cheesey, meatey, ooey gooey deliciousness. It also comes with a side of homemade chimmichurri which was fantastic (you can also buy it by the jar here!)  Jimmy's used to be my go-to coffee spot in this area, but sorry, Jimmy's! La Merceria has stolen my heart. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"easily the cleanest and best looking vietnamese restaurant i've been to.  very friendly and hospitable waitstaff -- you're served a smile and some tea in a visually-above-average white ten ren's mug as soon as you sit down  their menu has all the typical vietnamese restaurant items -- soups, vermicellis, rice dishes.  i ordered the seafood egg noodle soup, which included fish balls, squid slices, bbq pork, ground pork i think, shrimp, and imitation crab meat.  the broth is rather mild in flavour, but has green onions and some fried chopped garlic so that it's not entirely boring.  came in a decent portion size for the $8.50 price tag.  good (but not stellar) food, with excellent, welcoming service.  overall i had a good experience and would recommend this place to any fan of vietnamese food.  might be a nice place to grab dinner after a long day of shopping at yorkdale.  i will certainly not forget this cafe"}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood cafe. Nice beef empanada, spinach wasn't as good though - authentic Argentinian. Artsy ambiance, cold draft up front, good coffee. A true haven on an icy day in Toronto."}
{"text":"Spectacular.  A wonderfully cozy place that makes you feel like you're in Buenos Aires and not Southern Ontario.    There's no reason to wake up at 7 in the morning ever.  But if you do, this is the first place you should go.  Instant peace.  Calm.  Chill.  Beautiful decor.  Excellent coffee.  Free wifi.   Hidden gem.  Never leave.  Love everything.  Amazing.  I sit in the gorgeous wooden antechamber and smile.  A very deserving five star review."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  This place was good, but I wasn't blown away. However they earned a future visit from me due to their wide menu options available.  I just finished lunch here after searching up noodle soup places in the North York area. This place came up and scored a 4 star with more than 10 reviews, so it looked like something I would consider trying.  The plaza itself isn't exactly what you call spectacular, but I've definitely seen worse plazas out there (Downsview isn't as bad of a community as people think). However the inside was quite modern looking. It also seemed like a family business, which is always a welcoming sign in terms of service.  I ordered the crab meat with shrimp udon noodle soup. I used Kim Po to compare which one was better, as that restaurant also offers this dish. Unfortunately Kim Po won this one; the udon broke apart quite easily, which shouldn't be the case for Vietnamese style. I liked the addition of fried cuttlefish \"balls\" and shrimp pieces, however the crab meat soup base didn't have that much taste. Mind you I did burn my tongue on my first sip so that might have something to do with it. Be careful when having this dish!  In terms of price this is definitely of a higher end for Vietnamese restaurants. I can't say in terms of this dish alone that my lunch was worth it, but the menu offered lots of options that I can try in the future.  Service was excellent and both employees made sure I knew how to order. I also noticed there were a lot of regulars in this restaurant (lots of chit-chat between employees and some customers), so there's definitely merit in giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I will not forget thee!    After a lot of driving during car shopping day, we ended up way out of our neighbourhood at this gem of a place.   In a little strip plaza on the south side of Wilson you walk through the main doors into a tastefully decorated and very clean restaurant. The bathrooms were super clean as well!  It almost does not fit the rest of the mall.    The servers are happy and fast. We place our order and the plate of sprouts, limes and greens shows up immediately. Quickly followed by the super delicious spring rolls. I think these might be the best Vietnamese spring rolls I have had. Super crispy on the outside with only a little yielding of crunch when dipped in the sauce. Tough to pick up with chopsticks but worth the fight. Shortly after that our order of of two medium chicken broths and one small beef broth pho show up in the table.   The noodles were very good and the broth is light but brimming with a bouquet of flavours that just work perfectly together.   Bottom line is that this is a very good lunch or dinner spot that I would love to visit again."}
{"text":"What an adorable cafe just off Portland St.! It's steps from King West but feel miles away. Part home decor boutique, part cafe -- this is a cozy place to spend a lazy afternoon. The Argentinian vibe sets it apart from other cafes in the city. Not only do they have great espresso drinks and tealish teas, but they are accompanied by tasty food offerings like empanadas (beef, chicken, or spinach) and alfajores (a dulce de leche cookie sandiwch - yes it's as good as it sounds). Plus, I just enjoy listening to the staff speaking Spanish. Hot drinks come with a mini cookie on the side -- a cute touch. The boutique sells things like greeting cards, dish towels, embroidered iphone cases, and other gift-y items."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place after brunch in the area. It's a cute little vintage cafe, and I can see some people really loving the atmosphere. The space is a bit too cramped for my taste and seating is not comfortable given they mostly have vintage wooden furniture. I had the apple cider; it was mediocre. Heard their coffee is much better and will give that a try if I ever go again."}
{"text":"This is a cute, little coffee shop. I was happy to find out that they serve pumpkin spice latte even in the spring! They also sell a lot of small knick-knacks in the store so it's fun to walk through it and shop around."}
{"text":"I will get right to my point!  I went here for dinner during a week day and had my usual pho and spring roles. It was okay nothing special about the broth, as a Vietnamese person we know our pho and how it should taste. The broth is what makes the \"pho\". (I am a person that will travel for a great bowl of pho) Its a nice little local neighborhood restaurant, spacious, clean and I like that they have booth seating, super friendly staff. Price is average/comparable to other pho restaurants. I will go back because it's convenience and the food is decent."}
{"text":"This is the slot where I normally make a witty remark about an establishment in which I have just dined or sipped, or gorged, or chugged but when I have nothing funny to say about a place, it doesn't mean it's humourless (and lord knows I'm not), it just means it's great!  La Merceria, an adorable, light-filled, little spot, in the heart of the King and Bathurst district, leaves me jokeless.  How can I kid about a place that makes a mocha latte by melting a bar of dark chocolate into a cup?  This coffee shop is serious business!  They also have very tempting pastries (I had to do everything to stop myself from picking off the buttery caramel from a pecan bun at the counter) and the cutest little tables.  Tip:  I for one have exed any boy off my list who has made the choice to take me for coffee on the first date, but I might reconsider if he brought me to La Merceria."}
{"text":"I'm still not sure if it's a coffee shop or gift store. Either way, I feel like spending some time there. The food smells, looks and tastes awesome, and portions are BIG. Try an empanada!   Now, let's start a new paragraph for their beverages: as an Argentinian place, they have an amazing coffee with traditional DULCE DE LECHE (if you never had it, go there NOW) and steamed milk, Café Caramelo. Also, Coffee with Condensed Milk. Their hot chocolate is made right: steamed milk with a melted dark  chocolate bar inside. Yeah. At last but not least, tea is Tealish and they do offer toasty almond, my favourite!  They serve some other food (soup, sandwiches) and, well, you can buy hand cream, crayons or a kitchen apron while you drink your coffee. This place is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Great pho.  Friendly service and clean spot."}
{"text":"The service here was very good. The staff were pleasant and there was no language barrier. I had the beef stew with egg noodles. It was flavourful and the meat was easy to eat; not chewy."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday to study for the day. This cafe is spacious and cozy. I found myself feeling at home (but not home since I could study here) and their layout is perfect to study alone or in groups as big as 5 ppl!   I liked their coffee ($2 for medium cup), and it came with a complimentary sugar cookie! Cappuccino ($3.35) was average but my friend said their hazelnut latte ($4ish) was good.   Food wise, empanadas are good, butter tart was creamy and yummy (could be heated better but tasted good cold too)   Will be coming back, what a good place to study and catch up with friends. The service was good too (thank you for letting me stay for soooo many hours :$)"}
{"text":"The broth is surprisingly good. It's a great pho spot in the Yorkdale area. Don't be fooled by the location of this place, the soup is really good!"}
{"text":"What a great little cafe space in the busy Adelaide area! The owners and staff are so kind and accommodating. There is a great work space towards the back of the store, and so many fun trinkets and various home/candle things available for sale. The hazelnut latte was really delicious. Wifi is fast. Not a lot of plugs."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened.  If you want fresh, light, tasty, healthy, clean and perfectly-sized portions, paired with exceptional customer service and staff who take a genuine interest and pride in their Vietnamese food, come here!  This place never disappoints.  It is one of those places where you go in and are guaranteed a perfect meal.  Rare beef and chicken pho' - 5/5 Salad rolls (non-fried spring rolls), background notes of lemon grass, so fresh and satisfying - 10/5 (seriously) Grilled pork chop with egg, rice and delicately pickled vegetables - 5/5 Small soup (to accompany pork chops) - 5/5 (background note of star-anise - NOT SALTY) Café da - 5/5 - smooth (am bouncing off the walls from caffeine but I love it)!  I told the owner today about my experience at a Vietnamese place down in the U.S., how it compared and how incredibly fortunate we are in Toronto to have authentic, true to their roots Vietnamese food.  This is true, 100% Viet. cuisine at its refined best.  Love."}
{"text":"Okay, I'll just go ahead and say that this is one of my favorite places in Toronto.  That's actually not saying much considering my consistent disappointment in Toronto, but this place would be great anywhere.  If only it were open until a reasonable hour.  No cafe that closes at 6:00pm can get more than 3 stars.  I mean, they are closing almost when I want to go there.  No after-dinner coffee.  No after work conversations.  It's just too damn early.  So this rating is despite a great Illy bean Americano, great spinach and egg thingy, great desert, great ambiance, and an amazingly friendly, helpful and cheerful barista.  The place is filled with cute and expensive nick-knacks and kitchen goods.  Even the music was awesome.  The only bad thing I can say about this place is the hours, but that's a big deal.  It doesn't matter how awesome the place is if I can only rarely go there."}
{"text":"Very great place. Honestly I haven't been to a cafe that nice in a while. The service is super.....the place itself is cozy. It doesn't look big at first but there's a lot of space to sit inside and Wi-Fi is also provided. When it comes to the menu, I think they have the best empanada in town and I look forward to having some again soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden jem! The quality of the food has always been consistent. It's actually one of our favourite go to places in the area.   The broth is delicious and the veggies are always fresh. The Singaporean noodles & calamari are a must try. Our favourite dish is the vermicelli with salad, grilled pork and spring roll, with an iced Vietnamese coffee.   The service is always welcoming and quick and the restaurant is super clean.   Parking spaces are a bit tight especially during peak lunch/dinner times."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of this place I expected it to be amazing. But it's not even that good. It isn't authentic at all. It's okay. Not horrible. But there are better places with a little bit of a drive down the street. It is a very western place. Not really Asian.... But not bad. Just I guess I expected better"}
{"text":"VIBE  You know how you read design magazines or go onto Design Sponge and think \"Yeah, I wish my place looked like that?\" And then you think \"Well, I'm too lazy to make my couch out of church pews and I can't afford Brian Gluckstein's taste?\"  You can get that vibe at La Merceria. There is a lovely bench in the front and a few wooden chair and tables; there's also a quiet space and more bench room in the back (with limited outlets to plug in your laptop).  Affectionately known to me as La Merc this is one of my go-to spots to work. Lots of creative types come in and out of this button-cute café or stay all day (like me). An added bonus is that you can buy a lot of home décor stuff from brands like Dwell  or sweets from Bobette and Belle all while waiting for your hot chocolate/latte/espresso (choose your poison). The staff are friendly, relaxed and professional. Plus, there is mellow Argentinean music in the background. The owners are Argentenian and if you have a chance to see their son, he is the cutest little boy!   I EAT/ATE La Merc makes a really mean hot chocolate; they also make a good chai latte and London fog. Their tea is sourced from Tealish and they'll make a brewed version and ice it for you. It's so tasty! Their prosciutto sandwich is so good you may rip one of your molars out (the bread is pretty hard--not in a stale way but more in a texture way-- but I don't care) and if you're looking for alfajores, they are the source!  They charge the standard price and take debit/credit.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Dwell in your second living room away from home. And buy it too!  *Still don't have that copywriting job. Knock Knock! Who's there? Not an advertising agency."}
{"text":"Just had their pho, possibly the best I've had in a while, generous portions of beef and noodles for the XL at $9. Spring rolls were crispy, fresh and ingredients of veggies, meat and noodles were perfectly balanced deep fried and packed in the roll.  For an order of XL pho and spring rolls came to $20 tips and taxes in, cheap and delicious for those looking for a quick yet savoury lunch in the area.  Service with a smile and efficient, not busy when we were there Thursday afternoon. Most of their customers work in the area, we just happened to wander off around here after our Costco trip and it definitely was a better decision than having our usual poutine."}
{"text":"Located on the north-west corner of Adelaide and Portland, this coffeeshop/store is easy to miss because it doesn't look like your typical coffee establishment. However once you go inside, it's atmosphere/design and the smell of coffee will make you want to find out what this place has to offer.  I brought a few of my friends here and they all said the same thing about La Merceria. They said that it was comfortable, welcoming and a great place to meet with friends. Compare to Jimmys Coffee down the street, this is a slightly better location to get work done because it's quieter but it's the other way around when it comes to the coffee.   I'll be honest and say that the coffee is average. There's better coffee in other places in the area but I am always willing to sacrifice the quality of coffee when I can have the coffee somewhere that I can actually get work done. I would recommend La Merceria but I just hope that this review is not read by everyone because I want to keep this hidden gem to myself."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best, if not the best places to get a coffee - from cafe con leche, to cafe con dulce de leche.  The owner, Marcello spent over 1000 cups of experimentation to get it \"just right\" as he once told me.  Come here for lunch and order the \"Parma sandwich\" - a long Italian style sandwich with prosciutto with cheese and a slice of pear on an Italian bread, warmed up on their sandwich machine - it's amazingly good.  The owner's family ships in daily fresh empanadas and tartas, which are as good as anything home made from your grandmother in Buenos Aires.  The ambiance, the location, nothing is out of place here.  Cozy, not pretentious.  The staff, very cool, friendly, and genuine.  Drop in for a coffee and an alfajor, you won't regret it.  It's our favourite cafe in the entire city, we come down from Yonge and Lawrence for lazy afternoons on Saturday's to enjoy the coffee and just reading a magazine while sipping away the afternoon."}
{"text":"Best Viet I've had in Toronto. I used to go every week, Now I moved and yet I travel an hour every once in a while. Its that good."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe with a friendly owner. Enjoyed a great drip coffee in the quiet back room."}
{"text":"Great little viet spot! Had the rare beef with tendons! Only viet place that had good soft tender tendons! Although we ordered the XL, the beef and tendons were the size of small! Only a few pieces of tendons and just enough beef! A bit cheap on filling in the roll as well!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go through the trouble of downloading an app to rate a place,but when I do its cause it was truly exceptional, best viet  restaurant so far in toronto."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. Calm and quiet cafe very suitable for working and studying. The owner is very kind.   They offer decent coffee specialities and their Nutella latte is top. WiFi is fast and uninterrupted, the decoration is bright, mostly white. They sell cookies, muffin, apple crumble, and some savory too. And it's cheap. A very good place to be"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant in the area and possibly THE pho restaurant in the GTA.  This is the only pho restaurant that I am not afraid to throw a handful of bean sprouts in because the flavour does not waver.  The soup came out hot and dark ... yum. The special pho came with a GREAT amount of noodles and portioned perfectly with just the right amount of meat.  The spring rolls here are totally worth it; they're crispy and tasty for only $4.50!    The owners/workers are always around to make sure you're taken care of. The chopsticks were however a little sticky and one of the 'clean' bowls they gave me had a little curry sauce from before ... down 1 star.  But I'm definitely coming back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I decided i was tired of commercial cafe/coffee and decided to walk further into downtown from the Harbor front and saw this cute Vintage looking cafe in the middle of street. It didn't look out of place, but did at the same time. The name of the cafe is very much suitable to its core. You walk in and you feel transported out of the busy noisy city into a quiet but full of life quaint cafe in which you think you want to get a coffee to go but its too inviting not to sit and just enjoy the space. Filled with eclectic pieces of art that are fully kitchen functional to display of jewelry and scarves you want to play dress up with. The area looks small when you initially walk in, however, past the counter there's a different area of shopping delights and small work space. They have wifi! Services was great and owner was extremely friendly and talkative. Service was quick but not rushed. You can order via phone and the drink will be sitting waiting for you. I found the coffee fresh and the Nutella Latte amazing. Reasonable priced as it is cheaper than Starbucks with a better experience if you want to sit cozy and not rushed. Wish I could transport it back to Edmonton!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. One of the ladies there is very polite and makes sure your needs are met. Clean and luxurious look. TV if you need entertainment. Bathrooms are clean. Great place."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fantastic service. Had the spring rolps, meat roll, special pho. Highly recommend it to anyone that likes Viet food."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. Stepping in here is like walking into somebody's home...somebody with really great taste in housewares. But I felt a bit like an elephant in a china shop here; everything is a really tight squeeze and I was fearful of moving too abruptly lest I knock a delicate handblown $19 glass off a shelf. The fact that the service was seriously unfriendly made me even more uneasy. However, I had an Iced Americano here which was excellent - really smooth and well-balanced - and I would love to come back and try some of their food options. Unfortunately, the staff didn't really seem to care about their customers (no hello, no welcome, not even a smile) or the shop (of the like, five tables in the whole store there were three of them with dirty plates just sitting there), and that kind of careless service is enough to keep me from returning anytime soon. I wish the people behind the counter were warmer! I could see myself totally loving this place."}
{"text":"Great, cozy little cafe in a good location. Sometimes it's busier than others but I can always find a place to sit. The back areas are really nice and quiet. Perfect for relaxing.  Lovely decor and staff are super friendly! Excellent coffees and teas. Have had a sandwich or two and they're okay too.  My go to cafe when I'm in the area before or after work. A gem!"}
{"text":"Got an almond latte and macha latte. We had to ask for the free biscuits. The art wasn't nice as we expected. Drinks were bland, meh. They got free wifi and a vintage nice decor."}
{"text":"Whatever you like to call my favourite espresso \"dessert\" drink: Manchando or Cafe Bombon. All I know that it is a condensed milk with a shot of espresso and foam.  La Merceria is one of the few cafes in TO that I can get my fix. Love the cookie on the side too and now I can be on high on sugar, caffeine and carb in one seating.  La Merceria is so cute. The backroom is really cozy just made me feel right at home and ready for an afternoon nap.   I need to come back and try their empanadas. So I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"MN#1 Duck Tongue Deep Fried MN#2 Crocodile Deep Fried MN#3 Grill Boar Meat Marinated with Salty Tofu MN#5 Stir-Fried Deer Meat MN#6 Venison Tartar  The menu here is extensive.......  No, I didn't order any of the above for my lunch. But Forget Me Not Cafe does offers some not to forget dishes that is different that what other Vietnamese restaurants I had been to in the GTA.  I ended up just have my usual Bun Bo Hue ($8.95). This might be one of the most authentic version of Bun Bo Hue I ever had. From the broth (chili oil, lemongrass, shrimp paste), protein (pig's knuckles, pig blood, sausage) and the condiments (the first time I have sliced banana blossom!)  The deco is really chic and modern, which I am quite surprise to find in the immediate area. The service is polite and efficient.  I will be back.. probably not for the crocodile meat but definitely a bowl of their noodles.... but you never know!"}
{"text":"lovely cafe with cute name. Lots of cute animals dolls or mugs like cats in this small cafe are on sale"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with its namesake on Adelaide, this place Is a small family business with some legit pho and great service.  I guess we are on a mission to find the best pho in the city, so when our friends and fellow yelpers raved about this place, we just had to give it a try.   Now, I must confess, I was on a bit of a diet and I didn't get a chance to sample everything but here's what I do have to say.....  The fried tofu was incredible. Spot on, not oily and just delicious. The perfect balance of spice and crispyness. I didn't have the spring roll but everyone said it was just wonderful.   I opted for the Thai style pho which had that 'Tom yum' flavour in it and asked for vegetables instead of noodles. The staff was so accommodating and did the substitution with the nicest and crunchiest of veggies!!! The broth tasted great and the amount of veggies they added made for a very filling soup as well.   Before we left, one of the staff and possibly the owner even discussed the menu and made some suggestions. For what to have next time. They ev n have crocodile on the menu butt I think I will be sticking to the more traditional fare!"}
{"text":"Had the bun thit nuong cha gio and durian milk shake.  The pork was grilled with a delicious Asian marinade and the spring roll was deep fried to perfection and filled with meat unlike other places that have a lot of filler.  The portion sizes are a little under just enough so if you're hungry, you'll need two. The shake was refreshing and they used real durian to make it not artificial flavouring.  The prices for their dishes are reasonable too. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes.  Many great options to choose from but not enough stomach space."}
{"text":"La Merceria is equal parts retail store and coffeeshop delicately juxtaposed in a small space at Adelaide and Portland. It's a mélange of Pinterest-esque cuteness here with notebooks, Caldrea soaps, home furnishings, acoutrements, bric-a-brac, knicknackery, etc. Their cash register is an iMac and nothing in here is more than a few tonal steps from ecru.  They serve Colombian coffee, real hot chocolate, and a variety of teas. Their muffins and cookies are from Sweets From The Earth and they have some sweet loaves from The Brick Street Bakery. Good to see them supporting local. They also serve sturdier fare like empanadas for $2.50. The prices here are pretty reasonable, but they do two things I'm not a fan of: a) charge $0.25 for debit if you spend less than $5.00 and b) prompt you for a 15% tip when you're using debit. Why not just let customers choose their own percentage? It's weird being put on the spot like this, and I prefer to tip with cash anyhow.  I like to come here and settle in one of the nook-like spaces in the back. You can a seat on one of the comfy sofa-like benches, or sprawl out with a throw pillow and take a nap. (I'm kidding, don't ever do this.) It's a great place to get some reading or quiet work done. They have free Wi-Fi, but not a tonne of outlets so keep this in mind. Very relaxing in here.   I must admit, my last visit was subpar: I took a bite of my mixed berry muffin and it was ice cold. Not just cold, the berries inside were kind of frosty. Mega turn off. I took it up to the front, and the girl at the front knew exactly what was up before I said anything. After apologizing for serving me a cold muffin, she offered to heat it up. Meh. I declined and abandoned the muffin with her and walked away unhappy. In retrospect, they probably could have and should have done more to make the situation right.   I probably won't get a muffin here again, but their coffee and the space are excellent.  Obligatory Title Pun: Have MERCI.  Menu Readability: Handwritten chalk above the counter.  Need to mention: The Wi-Fi password is unmemorizeable. You can ask the cashiers for it.  What this place teaches me about myself: I needs that muffin warm, girl."}
{"text":"Cute cafe that's a mix of a small quaint store and a coffee shop.   Space: - LOTS of space. It has 3 different sections for seating. But it gets quite stuffy at the back and it feels more like a dungeon as there's no natural lighting.  - Comfortable cushions, very artistic looking   Coffee: - Mediocre, I got a latte and an America I and I'm not sure if I would recommend!  Food: - interesting variety of dishes, can be a good place to grab a quick snack."}
{"text":"We loved this cozy little coffee shop! It seems to be the street level of a family's household - the same family who owns it. When my date and I walked in, there was a woman with a baby on her hip preparing a drink while a couple of teenage girls took our order. I loved the decor instantly. The rustic chic touches combined with the familial atmosphere made me feel at ease and at home.   My date absolutely adored his specialty coffee, and I enjoyed one of their specialty drinks - it was essentially a latte that swapped the normal espresso for rich dark chocolate. It tasted incredible.   We listened to yelp reviews and ordered some empanadas after we ate our croissants. Mine was chicken, his spinach. The dough was soft and so so tasty. It was not oily in the slightest, an impressive feat for empanadas. We would definitely come  again on our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Spent the day in Toronto and was celebrating my birthday. I love PHO and we decided to come here.   I got the usual. Pho, spring rolls and Avocado shakes. Omg. Best day ever.   Go here if you're ever in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I am not a big lover of pho.  Most of the time, I enjoy it and then it makes me so thirsty because of all the MSG.  Most of the time, it's comforting but I don't feel great after.  This restaurant has changed that for me.  I only tried one dish - the typical beef noodle soup, this time with chicken.  It was so delicious!  I normally drink most of the soup because I am a soup noodle junkie, but this time I drank every drop because it was THAT good to me.  It tasted clean and healthy, but still tasty.  I'm sure you know that that is a rare combo.  I was a little thirsty after, but it wasn't like the usual parched feeling I have after having pho.  I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu.  This is my new favourite place for pho!  Even though the drive time isn't the best, I think it'll be worth it next time I stop by Yorkdale Mall."}
{"text":"It's kinda insane how hard it is to find cold brew in Toronto. Stumbled upon this place after my first choice only had iced lattes. Adorable space, delicious cold brew and amazing prices! Been 3 times in the last 5 days"}
{"text":"Este es un café porteño en Toronto. Este es el idea el más mejor en TODO EL MUNDO.  This is a cafe straight out of Buenos Aires in downtown Toronto, which is quite possibly the best combination of cities I can hope for. I actually started to dance a little (my boots weren't heeled, so I was a few inches short of a tango) when I realized that this was a BsAs café and started gushing in Spanish with the owner about how excited I was that I found it.   Order their café caramelo (y si vos sos un porteño, \"café con dulce de leche\") and grab an empanada. Sit and pretend you're in Palermo (or Recoleta, San Telmo, Villa Crespo, your choice). Look at their tchatchkies. Swoon a little. Eat some more dulce de leche.  The only thing you do to improve your experience is simply go to Buenos Aires yourself. ¡Estoy felícisma! ¡Qué suerte, qué bueno que lo discubrí!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I wanted to give this place a try!  The location was close to Yorkdale mall. It was located in a strip plaza, so parking was hard to find and the area looked a bit shaddy...  When we got there, the restaurant was clean, unlike the outside look of the plaza. The washrooms were also very clean (so that's a plus)!  We ordered the assorted appetizer ($16.99), small special pho ($6.00), and bun bo hue (spicy noodle soup $8.00). The staffs were friendly and would come by and ask how the food was.  The food arrived hot as expected. The taste was typical, not too special. The portions were decent. What I would like to comment on is that the noodle soups had a lot more topping compared to other Vietnamese cuisines. So, for the price, it was great!  They may have used a bit of MSG in the soup base as after that meal, my friend and I were very thirsty! Overall, it was good! Will come back if I'm around!"}
{"text":"Finally checked it out and loved it!! But note to self, almond milk and coffee don't go together, at least not for me."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there are no reviews for this restaurant when it's been in business for a while now. I guess I'll be the first to pop Forget Me Not's cherry haha.  We arrive for an early lunch and were the only customers who were actually having a meal. There was just another random man there having a beer...at 11 am =S.  The bun bo hue my dad ordered was super spicy but it tasted good. Too bad I am intolerant to spice so just taking a sip of the broth made me cough. My mom and I had the udon noodles with crab and it was hot and delicious. My sister had the pho and she had no complaints about it. I had a sip of the pho broth and it was good.  Overall, the food and service was great. The only con I would have to say is the price. It's a bit more expensive than the majority of Vietnamese restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite vietnamese restaurant in Toronto.  Ive tried almost everything on the menu.  The owners are also very friendly and personable.  I highly recommend coming here.  My fav dishes are the fried tofu and eggplant, grilled beef rolls, and pho."}
{"text":"Super awesome springrolls. Just the way I like it, with the super crispy outside (not the traditional egg wrap ones). I've been here twice already and so far, so good! All the food I've ordered is pretty good. The restaurant looks cute, clean washrooms, has lots of comfortable seating, free wi-fi, great service, and is in the Downsview area. I'm going to keep coming back, no doubt about it! PS - they have crocodile on the menu but I'm not daring enough to try it"}
{"text":"Anything less then 5 stars and ur just nitpicking. This place is adorable and has amazing coffe and vibe and places to sit and just shut up and come here. I'm visiting from out of town and wish I could live here based soley (sp?) on this place and the Mexican place next door. Come here."}
