{"text":"I'm actually surprised this restaurant isn't listed and I'm adding it - it was the best place we ate this trip to Montreal. Tucked away in old downtown Montreal, it has a really cool interior with padded couches to sit on and very romantic lighting and ambiance. Our waiter was so nice. I don't think our water glasses ever went empty and he was very generous (he was making the drinks) with the alcohol. I loved the music - a huge selection of covers, some in French and some in English. The menu isn't huge but it is interesting. The presentation of the meals were fantastic - it's like the chef was also an artist with how they placed it on the plate. Very flavorful and not too spicy. It was pretty quiet when we were in there which is a pity as it's such a unique menu for Montreal. This is our first place for dinner when we return to Montreal!"}

{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than five stars!! It was the best place we went our whole trip! The aesthetic was so cool, music was great, and the place was just filled with great vibes. The food was amazing. We had the seafood risotto, Summer salad, and salmon, and all were superb. Drinks were also delicious and the owner even made us a special drink to try. He was so kind and attentive and we wish him the best as this business continues to grow! Good luck and best wishes to our favorite place!!"}
