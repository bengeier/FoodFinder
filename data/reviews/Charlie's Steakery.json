{"text":"Wow! Delicious sub! I tried the bacon cheese and it was fantastic. I'm a bit of a sub expert so the fact that I'm rating this so high is saying something. I came in here looking for subway and stumbled upon Charlie's! What an unexpected surprise #ItIsWhatItIs"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, its located in woodbine mall's food court. They grill everything on a \"grill table\" in front of you and the food comes out tasting great. I recommend getting the barbeque Cheddar or the steak and cheese. It's a little pricey but its well worth it."}
{"text":"What can I say about Charlie's steakery? If you are looking for a quick philly steak sandwich then this is the place to go. You will usually find them in malls within the food court. There philly steak sandwich is what I usually purchase and the portion of meat in the sandwich is more than enough, I also got the cheesy fries which are a little more expensive but worth every cent. I also enjoy the fact that they make the sandwich for you right there."}
