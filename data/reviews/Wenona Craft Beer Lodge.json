{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Wings were really good. Ribs were not. Service was bad; forgot half our order and waited forever for a beer. It annoyed me that they give you these tiny plates and then nothing to put the bones in. Plus, if you serve ribs you should bring moist toilettes too."}
{"text":"Visited this little gem last night and was pleasantly surprised. The wings were 2 for 1, smoked for four days and delicious. It came with two sides. I had the Mac & cheese and the hush puppies which were pretty wonderful.   Nice selection of craft beer also. Tried the Woodhouse Lager which was damn tasty.  It's a cozy environment and the waitress was super helpful and really charming which always makes for a more enjoyable experience.   The chairs could be comfier but I'm not going to whine about that. Look forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Excellenttt! Fkin loved this spot so much. Staff r wikkid and the new menu is even better than the other one. (Which was tough to beat)"}
{"text":"Excellent service the two times we've been here. The waitresses here are some of the most helpful and friendly around.  Chilled out atmosphere. We only ordered cocktails so can't comment on the beer selection. The wings were decent but the portions could have been better."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here eating a beef brisket slider and a hotdog shaped like an octopus.  It's delicious and the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"I had an appointment at 5 pm for a barbecue. Me and my buddy went to the establishment but were told by the lady there that the meal wouldn't be ready till 6:30 pm. We didn't want to wait so long. We were very disappointed"}
{"text":"Between opening and the recent menu change I regularly found myself either at Wenona, or plugging Wenona. Then they took the bannock and kale salad away from me... Not cool guys.   Interest lost."}
{"text":"Now this place knows great beer! Walking in you are greeted by friendly staff and the most tantalizingly delicious smell of BBQ! Sadly I had dinner plans but I enjoyed my 2 pints of locally created beer (Junction's Berliner Weisse and Collective Arts's Ransack)."}
{"text":"Celebrated my Birthday with some BBQ, craft beer and cocktails at Wenona Lodge last night and cannot recommend this place more! The staff was so friendly and accommodating, even when my party of 15 turned into a party of 20! And the chef has some serious skills! This place is doing it RIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"Their new bbq menu is decent; they definitely know what they're doing in the meat department. The smoked wings were delicious but the macaroni and cheese I ordered on the side were cold and a little dry.  Well, our server was nice enough. It doesn't bother me when servers don't write orders down, what does bother me though is when they don't write orders down and asks what we ordered over again and then forgets to bring something I've asked for, even if it's a glass of water. And when a group of six sitting to the right of our table asked her to take their picture, she took their picture from the left hand side of our table, with flash, and just said \"don't worry, you guys aren't in the picture.\" Oh and then they weren't happy with the picture. So sure, take another one while standing between the two tables with her back and ass fully backing it up onto our table. Amazing. A person from that table apologized to me but I don't think it should have been her. It should have been the server. She was obviously trying to do her best to help that table of customers except she didn't realize that she was being extremely rude to another table of customers."}
{"text":"Small craft beer bar with a great atmosphere, yummy food and friendly staff. It just opened a few weeks ago and is a great addition to the neighbourhood as well as the city. It feels like you're drinking in the shed of a cottage way up north."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, solid service, TVs playing the game that don't dominate the venue and you can actually get a table. Wenona doesn't stand out as a must visit but when some of the other local bars are packed and uncomfortable this place is a good alternative."}
{"text":"What  a friendly place with  great food! The atmosphere is very RED GREEN, warm cozy & comfortable. A good selection of beer & draft ,and the cocktails are varied & tasty. Try the Wings,they were the best  I've  had in a long time! The service was friendly and professional. Really had a great meal ! There is a really  nice menu ,with lots of choices. Give this place try, I am sure you will be pleased ."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere with a great craft beer selection and good food. Owner/bartender is very knowledgable about their craft beer selection and is the heart and sole of this hidden gem with a great vibe (make sure you try the food to!)...definitely my go to when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Great service, prices, atmosphere and food makes this a must visit! Everything was great from the kale salad to brisket, chicken wings, double fried seasoned fries (yeah that's right!) and pulled pork! Highly recommend you check out this hidden gem."}
{"text":"- Excellent selection of beer  - Really cool cottage/ski lodge interior - Ribs and fries are on-point, chicken wings won't be missed - Your clothes will smell of smoke (wood, not cigarettes)"}
{"text":"Really great selection of beer:) I recommend the Woodhouse beer because it's hard to find in the city. Great hot sauces that are made in-house. The sauces are so good in fact that if they sold them to customers, I would buy them all.   As a vegetarian, there's not much selection for us there, but the fries and hush puppies are great.   Service is amazing!! Only lost one star because I wish there were more veggie options (but considering this place specializes in BBQ, I can't blame them haha)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and drink. The beef dip was flavorful and the kale salad accompaniment was also great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Walking through the front door of Wenona Lodge instantly overwhelms the senses with the potent smell of BBQ smoke that hits you like a quick but delicious punch in the face. Atmosphere is dimly lit, but casual and comfortable.  The kitchen is now being run by the Pork Ninjas' Jason Rees, who had previously set up shop in the kitchen of Baju @ then Monarch Tavern. Based on my experience here, I will say his work is improving.   I had the pulled pork sandwich which I did really enjoy, especially how they give you a side of coleslaw (pro tip: put the coleslaw on the sandwich). Also had the hush puppies which were decent but I will say that online the menu has them listed as \"jalapeno corn fritters\" and I did not notice any jalapeno flavouring.  Settling in at the bar, you'll find 10 rotating Ontario craft beer taps and a decent selection of tall boys, all in the $7-$9 range. Definitely a couple of interesting selections including some nitro taps.    Bonus shout outs to the server with shoulder length brown hair. She was clearly overworked as she was tending to the whole room and bartending at the same time (apparently normally more staff are there during that time) but she was awesome in holding the service side of the experience, so I feel an obligatory written kudos should be added to this review."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar here as one of the stops during a Craft Beer Hop for my partner's birthday!  Got the fries but the menu had a lot more great offerings if you have more of an appetite. The bar was dimly lit and the inside looked like a winter ski cabin!  The bartender was great and made some suggestions for us. I went with the Jelly King Sour and it was really good.   We had one more stop after this but wouldn't have minded checking out dinner here.   Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great cozy spot near Dufferin station. The crew is friendly and they have great beer."}
{"text":"Great new place from the guys from Tallboys. Haven't had the food but there's a great selection of rotating craft beers and great service. Nice mix of people too. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The decor is ski lodge chic. The beer on session that evening was Collective Arts, which was fantastic because I like the ones I've tasted. I had the porter this time and it was soothing without being overwhelming.  I ordered the pulled pork, fries and bean salad. I am glad I ordered the pulled pork because not everyone who ordered the brisket was satisfied with their order. The pulled pork was delicious! I kept swirling it in the carolina tang and maple (?) sauces. It was absolutely delicious!  I enjoyed how they prepared the bean salad with celery and pepper. The biscuit was cute (in shape of a pig) but not that tasty!"}
{"text":"Wenona is one of those places were I have been many times and then kicked myself when I realized I hadn't yet reviewed them.      Easy 5 stars, the reason for which broken down into two.    First 5 star: the bar is exactly the type of neighbourhood bar one wants to visit. Small enough that it is intimate but large enough you are likely able to get a seat.  Their craft beer selection is one of the best in the city - from draft to tall cans - and it is run by a collective group of owners, one of whom always seems present.   The service here is top notch for this type of establishment.  The people who come here are also friendly, last time we were there we joined a Janga game with the table beside us - who doesn't love that type of stuff?   If you don't, then this is still the place for you because there are no expectations to speak to anyone.    Second 5 star - Pork Ninjas please?   Yes please!   There is so much I love about Pork Ninjas I am not even sure where to start.  Their pulled pork, brisket, ribs are deliciously smoked and arrive tender, full of flavour and with a selection of sauces. I love their hushpuppies, cold slaw and I love even more that they are a mostly female kitchen.   Best BBQ I have had in TO (outside of Barque. Certainly beats Stockyards - expect the ribs)  Bar wise - not really a wine or cocktail place - but have decent options for both so feel free to bring non-beer drinking friends.   Food wise - everything is great although the pulled pork nachos are not for us.  I think we are just nacho purests     Go for the atmosphere  Go for the service Go for the beer options Go for PORK NINJAS"}
{"text":"Did I just teleport to cottage country? That's what I asked myself the first time stepping into Wenona. My friend and I came for the monthly pig roast. I was hoping they'd bring the whole hog out and serve it right in front of us, but no dice. The pig was delicious anyhow, insanely juice and flavourful. But the sides may have stole the show. The ninja fries are like a dream...from my childhood. I used to love going to Costco and buying a big ol' plate of fries and sprinkle on the most delicious Cajun seasoning. This reminding me of that, without having to lose a piece of my soul in the rush of bulk buyers. Anything deep fried is good, well anything that's cornbread and deep fried is better. These hushpuppies have a mild jalapeno hit and strike a good balance between being moist and being crumbly. We also had coleslaw and sautéed rapini, but they just can't compare to the deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Wenona Craft Beer Lodge.  We've been there just after it opened a couple years ago and haven't had a chance to go back.  Gord likes it there because they have an interesting selection of craft beer (no big beer companies).  They have changed the kitchen since we were there.  It's now Pork Ninjas.  Gord ordered Smoked Meat Loaf and had hush puppies and mac & cheese as his sides.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and mac & cheese.  It was quite a meal and I was full at the end.  I liked everything for the most part.  I wasn't crazy, though, about the batter on the chicken.  It was too big and puffy and overdone (I picked it all off).  I'd see if I can get the chicken without the batter next time as the chicken was tender and tasty."}
{"text":"We are here from out of town and staying at an air bnb up the street. With so many places to eat around it was difficult to make a decision. We were NOT let down!  Everything that we ordered was so tasty and great beer selection.  The place smells great when you walk in and is very clean! The service was spectacular, would recommend this is anyone and would come back here for sure! Maybe for the pig roast?"}
{"text":"They don't sell most of the dishes that are shown in here more. Just classic PUB overall."}
{"text":"Toronto has a fair number of BBQ places to visit, but Pork Ninjas is one that distinguishes itself from the pack with some fantastic ribs and fried chicken. The ribs where smoked perfectly with an amazing smoke taste and some cajun spices sprinkled ontop. The bones were nice and meaty and an absolute must eat when visiting. They also have a nice collection of in-house BBQ sauces that are all worth trying as they each bring something different to the table. The other great dish was the organic fried chicken. The flavour is unique and there's a ranch-type sauce thats ontop of the chicken that makes this piece of bird stand out. There's a large variety of sides such as cajun fries, nachos and hush puppies (and more), all of which are tasty. The only under performer would be the smoked chicken wings, they get the job done, but I wouldn't recommend eating only that when visiting as there's other dishes that are much stronger. I didn't get to try the brisket but based on how well smoked the ribs are, the brisket is probably going to be a heavy hitter as well. Pork Ninjas is absolutely worth visiting and has quickly become one of my favourite BBQ joints in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had the chicken wing plate with Mac and cheese and falafel. So good! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fantastic bbq with a laid back, relaxed interior.  The beer selection was fantastic and the service was very accommodating.  Around 20 of us arrived here with no reservation on a lark and they were able to serve us all.  Clearly it isn't as busy as it deserves to be.  Some had the beef brisket, we had the pulled pork; both were amazing.  They also had fried corn bread which I had never had and made a great side.  Lastly, I tried the kale salad and could have happily just had a meal of it.  This from someone who doesn't say that often about salads.  Great experience, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Fun atmosphere, usually a good crowd, great staff.   There's a nice selection of Ontario craft beer (I think 10 taps), and the prices are good.   BBQ is amazing! The chicken is delicious, even though I usually think chicken is boring. Pulled pork - yum. And the sides are all good, though I'm partial to the mac n' cheese, coleslaw, or fries."}
{"text":"Last night I celebrated a friend's 40th birthday at Wenona, and it was an awesome experience from top to tail.  Two nights ago, the birthday boy and his lovely wife phoned me looking for suggestions. They had 24 hours to make a reservation for 10-20 people. On Bloor. Good beer list. Not a shit a hole. This sounds like an easy arena to play in, but the truth is... a large reservation the night before anything can be tricky. I've long been wanting to try Wenona. I like Tallboys, and camp is clearly an adorable theme, so I gave them a buzz on behalf of the happy couple. They were incredibly accommodating.   The atmosphere here is great. Lots of happy clients buzzing along with a super sweet staff, the faint smell of BBQ and a huge beer list."}
