{"text":"Just what the village needed.  Proper bar with clean, welcoming atmosphere and staff.    A simple and fun place to grab a pint or glass of wine and catch the game - food is reminiscent of what you'd get at the stadium which adds to the atmosphere when the sound of the broadcast is piped over the speakers.    Hotdogs, nachos (with classic stadium hot processed cheese) and popcorn.   Don't expect fancy fair.   And if the game goes south you can always hit some Super Nintendo or pinball at the back."}
{"text":"This is a great bar with an awesome array of local craft beer. Rotating taps and selection of tall cans  always give the opportunity to try local beers. Awesome service and down to earth staff."}
{"text":"Never a complaint when I come here. Delicious snacks, great beer and the staff are always ready to chat, give their recommendations of drinks and what's new to pour. The hot dogs are deliciously seasoned, just like you'd expect at a ball game or an event!   Restroom on the main floor makes returning to your table/group that much easier, as well as the option of pinball or snes/nes in the back if you're feeling competitive! Great selection of board games as well."}
{"text":"The service is horrible, food is awful after the fact,  and apparently it looks bad if your dog is outside while you watch over her sitting at the patio windows.  Manager asks me to leave because doesnt like dogs locked up outside. Meanwhile people are enjoying my bully and having fun with her. People even wondered why I was asked to leave. Totally bad excuse for a bar on roncesvalles. Round the horn should be called \"horn up their asses\". Lol. Went over the the dizzy instead where they like dogs. Spoke to a few customers at dizzy who know the staff who asked me to leave, don't go to round the horn because of him and now you've lost another, and more."}
{"text":"Have been to this location in its previous incarnations as gourmet restaurants. So we decided to pop in and see what the new place was all about. The place is beautiful, interior appropriate for a high-end restaurant, and they have the most fantastic patio in the city.  The new owners just added a whole bunch of TVs and decided to go with a sports bar theme.  Good list of draft and bottled beers. However, this is not the place to go for food. They only make two things - bad nachos and good hot dogs. The waitress says they're going for a \"ballpark\" feeling. However this simply doesn't match the decor or location.  Personally, I find the hotdogs and nachos at the ballpark are usually pretty blah but you eat them because you're there. I definitely wouldn't choose to eat nachos and a hotdog on a regular night. I like going to sports bars sometime, but knowing the history of this place the kitchen is fully functional and there's no reason they can't have a decent menu. I mean really, a sports bar where you can't get a burger and fries? No wings? What's the point?  If you want to pub with big tv's, great beer AND great food there are plenty on the Roncesvalles strip.  If you just want tv and beer RTH is fine."}
{"text":"I like this place! This place has such a great patio, which I plan to make good use of this summer. I live right around the corner and went were often when it was a restaurant. The service was terrible at the previous restaurant and I'm happy to report that all of the staff I've interacted with at Round the Horn have been super friendly. I will say that you do need to know what this place is about - beer and hot dogs. The menu is tiny and basic - but that works for me. We went for beer and hot dogs and therefore were super pleased. Lots of TV's and chill vibe."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place. Good , friendly service. Hot dogs are tasty and there is a decent selection of beers. Great place to watch a game and meet some locals."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in hoping to watch a Jays game and enjoy a good beer....and that's exactly what we got. The beer list is extensive with a variety of local craft options. While the food menu is limited to stadium favourites (hot dogs, nachos, popcorn), they aren't your basic snack bar options. We enjoyed one of the gourmet hot dogs with chilli and cheese nachos. It should also be noted that they can make any of their hot dogs with a veggie dog."}
{"text":"Damn good beers, excellent hot dogs, and welcoming atmosphere all make Round the Horn a great spot for late afternoon or evening drink."}
{"text":"Love bars in Roncie but long for a place where people are under 40?Boom!Round the horn is your new spot.Great bar,even better staff and amazing owners.The hot dogs are just what you need to keep on truckin and the music is always decent.A most welcome edition to the hood with no lame blue grass twanging in the background."}
{"text":"79 cent hot dogs for 7.00 each Toasted stale bun that fell apart on first bite  Don't even pretend that this is a hot dog place But staff great and beautiful patio"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a comfortable spot to watch the game -- this is your bar! Several large television are spaced throughout the bar.   The regular fare of hotdogs, pretzels, popcorn, etc. is reminiscent of a ballpark. Every weekend they have a wonderful rotating menu. The chef is excellent -- I've enjoyed every meal.   The patio is fantastic in the spring, summer and fall! It's a great place to grab a pint on a nice day.   The staff is friendly and accommodating. They have a great selection of beer."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Simple menu with different versions of Gourmet Hot Dog.   Round the Horn is a great neighbourhood pub if you want to meet up with friends, have a quick bite and catch a game.  Love the selections of local craft beer both in Tall Boys and drafts. Great to support local breweries!  $10 pint and dog during Blue Jays game!  And for the summer months, don't forget to visit the back patio.  Worth dropping by if you are in the neighbourhood."}
