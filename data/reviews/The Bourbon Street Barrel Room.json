{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place , the food is also the same .... Delicious!! If you want to have a dining experience that you can depend on to make a bad day better this is the place ."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Prices very reasonable. Food was delicious. I've been to New Orleans and this was as close as you're going to get in Northeast Ohio to the authentic flavors of NOLA! The shrimp and grits were excellent. Our table shared desserts -the Beignets and Bread Pudding. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I live in tremont, and whenever I have a group of 6 or more friends or family, this is my \"go-to\" spot. They accommodate big groups better than any other place in the area. For me, the service has always been lightening fast, with zero issues. Clearly they've hired an experienced staff, so you're in good hands here.  The Food: While there's nothing on the menu that I'd necessarily rave about, overall they have really solid offerings, and I always seem to leave full and happy. If you like a lil spice, the VooDoo Mama is really satisfying. Also, brunch menu on weekends = solid.   Last Couple Points: if you're a sports fan, they have a bunch of jumbo tvs always set to the big games. Atmosphere still maintains a sleek, metropolitan vibe, and even tho the atmosphere is themed to match the cuisine , they've managed to do it without coming off tacky. It's a gorgeous space and comfortable too. Kudos to the owners, managers, and staff!"}
{"text":"Whoever heard of a New Orleans style restaurant without crawfish? Big disappointment! But in general, it is very cool!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so bad - I mean, it has one of my favorite food groups in its name! But I can't, and here's why. First time here was just for drinks and it was great. Second time for brunch. The place was practically empty and the food came out cold. Our waitress got it heated up and it was fine...But tonight is why I'm leaving this review. The service is pretty awful on a Saturday night. We arrived at 7pm and were told it would be an hour wait. We weren't seated until 9pm. Our waitress, who was wonderful and lovely, took our drink orders and came back to tell us she couldn't take our food orders yet because the kitchen was backed up. By 9:40, we placed our food order and finally got our meals by 10:30pm...and again, half of them were cold! Mega disappointing. I saw the manager (I think? She was wearing a headset) at one point with some customers apologizing to them for their waits tonight, but never did she come to our table. I've dined at every place just about on Professor, and sadly I think this restaurant just doesn't meet the customer relations standards of the rest. I would come back here for drinks at some point but until this place starts taking reservations it's just not worth the trouble on a weekend night.   ****EDITED 1/15/17: I do take back my presumption about the BSBR not having good customer relations. The owner just kindly messaged me to explain that this evening was their busiest they have seen since their opening, which is great for them - we just happened to walk into that. It was not a typical night for the restaurant, so while I can't change my experience, I do now acknowledge that it was not a normal one."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea what any of the other reviewers are talking about.  I went here with my family and of the 5 of us, not one had a decent meal.  Let me start with the pros for the restaurant, since that will be short.  The place has a nice ambiance, and the drinks are good.  My mom got an Old Fashioned on accident, not realizing what it was and she hated it, so I drank it and I have to say it was made well.  She said it was so strong she grew hair on her chest, but it's one of my favorites and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Now let's get to the food, or what little of it we got.  My brother's girlfriend paid $13 for a single, solitary crab cake.  My brother and her just started dating, so I didn't really want to ask her how her tiny serving was because she was being quiet.  For $13 I hope they crushed some valium in there or something, or else she got ripped off.  I hope she and my brother make it though, she seems nice.  My brother got the small portion of the hot legs.  I think he enjoyed his frog leg.  That's not a typo, they only gave him one.  I understand he got the \"small\" size, but doesn't 1 seem less like a small, and more like a Baskin Robbins sample size?  Don't most frogs come with 4 legs?  I know they aren't that hard to catch, I did it in a really tiny creek when I was 8 with nothing more than my hands and a bucket to keep them in.  Yet they must be really hard to come by when you have a Great Lake, grown men, and actual fishing equipment to catch them so you need to make your small portion size 1 frog leg.  The next 3 meals all suffered from the same problem, so I'll lump them into one section.  My dad got a pasta (I think) with shrimp, and grits on the side.  I got the voodoo mama or whatever it's called, and my mom got the jambalaya.  We all had different meats (shrimp, sausage, and chicken), and we all had very, very little of it.  My dad probably only got 7 shrimp for his meal, and they looked like the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen.  Picture a shrimp giving birth to a baby shrimp, then shooting the baby with a shrink ray.  That's what he got.  For mine I had to go on a search mission to find any sausage.  The chef blessed me with 5 thin, completely dried out pieces of pork.  I debated putting them in my water to rehydrate them a little so they wouldn't be the consistency of beef jerky, but my brother was looking hungry after his frog leg and if I put them anywhere within his arm's reach he would have snatched them for himself.  The jambalaya had the exact same problem as the voodoo mama, very very little meat.  My mom didn't say if it was bad, she said she forgot how it tasted because she ate all the chicken right away thinking there would be more in there.  They did have a crapload of rice in each dish, so thanks for that.  Thanks for filling my plate with the cheapest possible food you could find hoping I wouldn't notice(?) the lack of protein in any of our dishes.  The red beans on mine were decent (not great), the collared greens were bland, and the rice (all 3 pounds you used to make the plate look like a real dinner) was seasoned ok, actually.  If I went here for the rice I would have been pleased, I guess.  My dad thought his grits were tasteless.  I told him that's how I remember having them from other places, but he said Bahama Breeze does them about a million times better.  I don't think that's saying much, I could make food a million times better than what we had, and just last weekend I burned breakfast (I was making cereal).  I also once burned my chest with bacon grease, but somehow it was in the shape of Ohio (GO BROWNS!) so that was cool.  I was sad when it eventually faded away, I was hoping the grease would permanently mark my body with a nature-made Ohio tattoo.  This is getting off topic so I'll digress:  Do not get food here at all.  Drinks, sure.  The extremely tiny portion size of the food you want will disappoint your taste buds and make you wish you were anywhere else eating anything else (except maybe soap.  Yeah, their food tastes better than soap by a tiny margin.)  So there ya go, I hope somebody takes this into consideration if they're thinking of going here."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, service was very attentive, and the bar is well stocked! I had a poboy and my wife had the shrimp and gritz. Both were spectacular, flavorful, and well crafted. We tried a beer flight as well (They have a ton of craft beer on tap, some hard to find stuff too). I also sampled a few bourbons from their extensive list. Atmosphere is fun. Great decor, not too loud. We really enjoyed outselved!"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Every bite of everything I had was delicious. Craft beer selection is good, especially $5 flights on Wednesday. Love the cocktail list as well. The atmosphere is great and I have never had a bad service experience.  I recommend an order of hush puppies, fried shrimp,  and save room for beignets."}
{"text":"The space and atmosphere is great.  Unfortunately, the food does not live up to rest of the experience.  I ordered shrimp and grits.  I was expected a handful of nice sized gulf shrimp.  Instead I got a huge amount of what looked like the kind of cocktail shrimp you would expect to buy in the frozen food section of your grocery.  The entire bowl (shrimp and grits) was swimming in some kind of oil.  I was expecting a tangy red sauce.  I also had a bowl of the gumbo.  It too was lacking in what you would expect to have in a good gumbo- it was missing andouille sausage, southern ham and it hardly had any chicken in it.  I really wanted to like this place but I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"My family and I went to enjoy some great Creole food and we couldn't have had a better time! Niki the Host was so welcoming and made us feel right at home! Food was delicious. My husband got the Shrimp Po' Boy and I got the Jambalaya. My daughters loved the Hush Puppies and Shrimp! Music was great! My daughters even started dancing. I can't wait to go back when we are in town! Thanks for a great experience Bourbon Street Barrel Room. Can't wait to meet again"}
{"text":"Great place!!   We ordered the sampler of three different items: gumbo, shrimp and jambalaya.  All were fantastic.  Real gas lights illuminate the outside and inside giving it the true New Orleans feel.  Off street parking w valet service."}
{"text":"Being from Louisiana, I had to try this place.  We walked in and I was SHOCKED at the decor.  I didn't expect there to be a second story balcony ala New Orleans.  Loved the gas lamps at each table and the woodwork was beautiful.  Drinks:  I had a hurricane, it was tasty.  Not Pat O'Briens, but still great!  Love that Abita beer was served, can't go wrong with a TurboDog!  Husband got a crab cake and loved it. I got the gumbo, which was good, but not quite what \"I\" would call a gumbo.    Hubs got Shrimp and Grits which were extremely tasty.  Expected the shrimp to be head on and bigger, so that was a bit of a disappointment.  I ordered the Cochon De Lait and was VERY happy.  Got fries on the side, those were boring and not that great for the additional $2.50 I was charged.  Now for the bad part.  We ordered beignets.  One was raw inside and they were very dense.  Not at all the kind of begniets I am used to.  I would NOT recommend those.  Also, why aren't Banana's Fosters on the menu?!!?  Overall I would recommend going to BSBR.  It was a fun place to visit and made me feel nostalgic for home.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We went here with friends last night for the first time and this is a definite do over. The meal was great authentic Louisiana creole and the drinks were spot on perfect. I particularly enjoyed the Shrimp Creole and everyone raves about the Cucumber Mint Gimlets. The atmosphere felt Bourbon Street and the crowd was having a good time. Our server, Gina was there quickly for drinks and while very attentive she never interfered with our meal."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere the gator bites are a good choice for appetizer and the shrimp and grits are amazing in my top 5 places to eat#1 in Tremont"}
{"text":"We had an awesome time watching the Cavs WIN here! Rachel was a fantastic bartender! Great place to watch the game- we will be back ;)"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it! The food and the atmosphere are great, I can't wait to go back and try their other dishes. I tried the hot legs appetizer and I thought they were great, my first time trying frog legs. The shrimp creole was well done, with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I recently had an unpleasant dining experience at BSBR. The food was great, but my service was not what it should have been. I left a Yelp review expressing my disappointment. I was later contacted by the owner. We talked about what had gone wrong throughout my dining experience. He was apologetic and was genuinely frustrated that it has occurred. I appreciate him reaching out to me and I have decided to give BSBR another chance."}
{"text":"Amazing! First timers. Gorgeous dining room but we sat on the patio because how often can you in Cleveland? Patio was intimate and charming. $5 off beer flights from the hearty list of brews. The food was delicious-shrimp and grits and shrimp and catfish combo. Breading on combo was crisp and flavorful-just like in NOLA. Could've done without the dessert-it was ok. Another order of shrimp and grits would've been better!! Hostess and waitresses were friendly and fast! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place and atmosphere! Absolutely try the sweet baby jesus beer if you have a sweet tooth.   Tip: trying to find a parking spot SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of NOLA, I can honestly say I LOVE this place! The mint julep is delicious, as well as the beef po' boy. The atmosphere is spot-on of the New Orleans feel. Go check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been craving chargrilled oysters for months now, and discovered these were on the menu here. We stopped in on a Friday night around 9:30pm and were immediately seated on the 2nd floor. Great view!  This is where the greatness stopped until dessert.   We ordered a bowl of gumbo, raw oysters, chargrilled oysters, crawfish etouffee, and shrimp creole. All were terrible. The roux tasted pre-packaged in the soups, and the chargrilled oysters are not chargrilled! This was more like an Oysters Rockefeller, so the misleading name should be corrected. There was spinach and a ton of cheese - no luscious lemon/butter/herb sauce, no smoky flavor. Extremely disappointing.  The only highlight was the bread pudding, which was out of this world. Sadly, the bread pudding couldn't stop this from getting a 2 star review. Won't be back until authenticity is established."}
{"text":"Great authentic menu, and the most underrated beer selection in town.  Guaranteed they will have a beer on tap that you haven't had before.  Every time I'm here, there's something new to throw back."}
{"text":"A very beautiful place but I found it to be slightly over priced. $11 for my Po Boy and an additional $2 for fries. I could seeing paying more but all my sandwich had was chicken, lettuce, pickles and a sauce. Drinks were great though and the staff was very attentive. I would recommend going."}
{"text":"I'm bummed it took me this long to try this hidden gem, but pumped that I know how great it is now.   A friend and I were having one of those \"what in the world should we eat?\" moments after we drove in circles downtown for (very literally) an hour. We decided to head out of the city and into Tremont where we could actually find parking.  We experienced a little bit of a wait, but I can totally understand why. The atmosphere is awesome, and fortunately, we got to sit on the second floor that overlooks the first floor--great views!   They have a great beer selection, with plenty of beers I've never heard of. Would have liked to try their extensive menu of NOLA inspired cocktails, but I was boring and stuck with beer.    Their food is great, too! I had the basic red beans and rice, which was full of flavor, and for the price was so worth it! I had dinner and lunch the next day for $13 bucks--can't beat it!  I did dock a star for the service which was a little slow and didn't get four of our eight beer flight choices correct."}
{"text":"The best Cajun food I have ever eaten.  My wife is from Louisiana so I know what good Cajon tastes like.  I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon the BSBR in Tremont.  Have been back with another friend from the South and tried many dishes.  All are authentic and excellent.  If you like Cajun you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not bad, but also not great. Their interpretation of Creole food is a little off the mark. I didn't like the flavor of their rue, it is a lillte too smokey. The fried foods were OK,  and the stuffed oysters were good. I would go back and I would take a guess from out of town to visit the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a great space. The restaurant opens up to a really nice vibrant two story volume. This place will definitely be kicking on Friday and Saturday nights. My reason for 3 stars, the beignets and fries tasted like they are cooked in the same oil as the fish. My po boy was good, but I expected a more unique/differentiated sandwich. Other than that the food for the rest of our group was good. I was surprised to see that the drink menu didn't have a full bourbon list, as the restaurant has the barrel room descriptor. Good options for vegan and gluten free. I'll come back for drinks and a second try sometime soon, as we did visit one of the first days they were open so I am sure that they are working out the kinks."}
{"text":"This beautiful spot missed out on a higher star value because the service wasn't great. The atmosphere and food is amazing. You feel like you've transported out of Ohio! The architecture is beautiful and the menu has core Creole and Cajun dishes, but is plentiful enough for even your pickiest friends. The drink list is vast and authentic, and the happy hour prices are good even for Tremont. The drinks, however, do take way too long to make; every bartender seems to use a jigger for every single drink instead of counting their pours. Really frustrating to wait 5 or more minutes just for a mixed drink.   I've been in several times and usually have sat at the bar. The bar staff mingles with patrons I assume to be regulars, and I've never really felt very welcome. This isn't a huge issue, but it's a personal preference to have a wait staff that tries to build \"regular\" customers out of first time visitors."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Beautiful decor inside. Really nice set-up with the high ceilings and upstairs bar area. Multiple TV's as well too, and the music they played was perfect!  Went for Happy Hour - solid beer selection with a focus on Abita. Not a huge fan of their beer but with $1 of drafts from 3pm - 7pm I went for one. They also have an extensive cocktail menu.  Food was very very flavorful! Had the hot rocks (shrimp) and I must say they were the best fried shrimp i've ever had. Light on the coating, flavorful hot sauce and a citrus slaw that blended well. A + there. Paired that with the jambalaya app which was also very flavorful. A great combo between the two of them.  Prices are a little high, which explains the 3 stars vs. the 4 stars. I will rate again when coming for dinner as opposed to happy hour, but it is a very solid place that I highly recommend.  Good service as well."}
{"text":"The ambiance deserves 5 stars, as well as the service we received. They didn't have the purple haze Abita which was strange for a Cajun restaurant. The only thing I didn't care for was the the gumbo, there was barely any meat inside. I ordered gumbo, and it was just OK. I ordered two cups to go as well and I believe I counted one piece of sausage in the two cups. I might give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"My favorite place on Professor. If you like Cajun food, this place is phenomenal. Drink menu is even better. Great place for a unique dinner."}
{"text":"Drove over an hour for some of the worst food and service ever.  Mufaletta was a bad ham and cheese panini.  The ham still had some weird plastic attached.  Husband could not finish oyster PO boy.  Trust me, just go to NOLA!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to throw your money at a bunch of underprepared meats, I recommend you take your money to the flats. The cost was higher than the cooks seemed to be. I've had better crab cakes from a gas station vending machine. On the plus side, there was ample seating and the service was great! Here's hoping the 7000% markup on the canned crab goes straight to the waitress. (PS: the po'boy is not the complete worst.)"}
{"text":"Cold food, undercooked rice, bland food. Mgr apologized but only took $3 off for sides n comped one entre'.....not good enough our whole party was unsatisfied"}
{"text":"I am a 'displaced Cajun' who lives on gumbo, jambalaya, etoufee, etc. in everyday life. There is no place like home. Except here: a place that can bring tears to the eyes of a homesick cajun.  Is it perfect? A close as it can get on the opposite side of the country. I cannot even tell you how much good it did my soul to have a full crawfish garnish my dish with his little red claws and to peel the tail off one of those suckers again.   I WILL be coming back and feeding my soul. I hope to see you there too."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The crab cake appetizer was small but delicious; loaded with crab meat.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  Blackened and moist.  Absolutely delicious.  The shrimp and grits was truly authentic and again, absolutely delicious.  Others in our party had the burger, po'boy and sirloin.  Everyone fully enjoyed their meals.  They also have an extensive beer menu.  The service was GREAT. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was warm and inviting, as were the staff.  Everyone was so helpful and friendly.  The food was so good, better than I expected.  The grits were creamy, the shrimp was cooked perfectly. The bread pudding.....no words to describe how great it was.  I spent my summers in Louisiana and I never had any as good as this one I had tonight.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with excellent food, great service and fun atmosphere.  The food was delicious from appetizers to the beignets.  The Category 5 hurricane packs a punch, but goes well with everything on the menu.  We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon , made a 5 pm reservation as i was going with two elderly parents ,,I had to insist on reservation which they took very reluctantly and insisted was no needed at that time.. Arrived the place was packed at 4:50pm with people waiting,,waited a satisfactory 10 minutes for a table. Service was fine at first,,,after appetizers came out the waitress informed us the system went down and our order did not get put in  ,,,,  45 minutes later and 70 minutes after placing our order the food came out ...some cold...my wife shrimp po boy had a whopping 5 small pieces of shrimp......the manager came over and apologized profusely   and got my cold food replaced in 2 min  (so why did it take 45 min to make a lost order?),,,,the check was presented with no mention of desert menu etc ,,,which we wanted as we were celebrating a birthday,,,,,of course the wrong desert came out,,,,the bill was the presented with a 30% discount,, which is useless to me because I wasted 80 bucks on lousy  food/service,,, my parents had been there before on weekday afternoons and have always enjoyed it in the past...me won't be back,,,popeyes  has a better po-boy"}
{"text":"I went for dinner a couple weeks ago and was unimpressed.  My entrée was rice, beans, and sausage (don't remember the exact name).  It wasn't bad, per se, but when ordering rice and beans for 10+ dollars I was expecting some real flavor and a lot of sausage.  Instead I got a dish I could have made at home for 2$.  For two of us eating and having beers the bill ended up being 60$.  Not worth it.  Food was corner dive quality but cost did not match.  But the beer was cold and the bartender nice.  I might go back to meet friends for drinks but would not order food again or volunteer it as a spot to go."}
{"text":"We are staying in the local area and stumbled across this place by chance. It is New Orleans style and executed extremely well - decor reminds me exactly of NOLA and the selection of food and drinks was fantastic. The service was excellent, we had a really friendly and helpful waiter who gave us lots of ideas of things to do in the area the next day. I was in a group of four and everyone enjoyed their food. I had shrimp salad which was delicious and a pimms cocktail which was also delicious. The others at the table ordered jambalaya, and BBQ chicken, a hurricane cocktail and then beignets and cafe au lait. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Got the shrimp creole, side salad with their creole vinaigrette, beignets (From Cafe du Monde!!!!) for dessert, and a few abitas.  Food was delivered to me VERY quickly.  It took a good gator sized bite out of my wallet and the portions were ok but could have been bigger, but if you're looking for something that you would get from the French Quarter, this is it."}
{"text":"this place is incredible. the food is phenomenal as are the drinks and the service. So authentic. The vibe is just right. Great place to hang out with friends or family. Overall outstanding!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday night with my other half and a friend who lives in Cleveland. Sat on the patio and had a wonderful meal. Our friend had great gumbo and I had a perfect oyster po' boy. For dessert, bread pudding with perfect bourbon sauce and delightful beignets. Oh and the drinks: Nola specialities are $2 off on Sundays. I had the Sazerac."}
{"text":"We waited 2  hours for a table in a cold hallway. The hostess was overwhelmed with the business and had no idea when a table would be available. Atmosphere was nice. Service was very slow. I ordered shrimp Creole which was unevenly warm. Everyone who ordered the sirloin steak said it was excellent."}
{"text":"Good drinks, authentic atmosphere. Felt like I was in New Orleans. Very inviting. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is fantastic!  There is a lot to appreciate aesthetically. The prices are reasonable.  I was ultimately a little disappointed with the food. Don't get me wrong,  it's definitely tasty, the jambalaya has great spices and the shrimp Creole was good. But it seemed dry and like it was missing something to pull it together and finish it off as a meal. I would almost say it needed it just needs a little butter,  something to put some richness and keep it moist.  I will definitely go again. It was good and I love the environment."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  We went for lunch on a Sunday.  The vent right over our table was blowing cold air.  The waiter made sure it was turned off.  Because the appetizer was not delivered on time we did not have to pay for it.  The Jambalaya was excellent.  So were the beignets. In a whim I tried the spice beer and that was delightful.  Atmosphere is lively - like entering a house in New Orleans.  Loved it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING. Traditional southern food!! We are from Louisiana and have grown up eating all the food they offer. I had the gumbo adding shrimp and crawfish, I would eat here a million times over. The crocodile was fabulous as well as the shrimp and grits. Absolutely tasteful and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Very good place to enjoy a meal. Wonderful decor. We sat upstairs overlooking the downstairs dining room and loved the view and noise level. We ate the shrimp and grits, and the jambalaya. Both were very good but the shrimp and grits were rave worthy. Great service from Lauren- attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of friends for Fat Tuesday. While they were crazy busy, the staff did a great job. I was expecially impressed with how quickly the food came out and the consistency.  Our group had a bunch of different appetizers and entrees and everything I tried was fantastic. Great wine and draft list and they make a top notch Sazerac."}
{"text":"Perfectly meets that niche of great food that doesn't break the bank. Can have great meal or sit at the bar and have 3 sides and be totally full for $15. It's exactly what Tremont is missing above Treehouse but under Dante."}
{"text":"Never thought I would be writing this review as I have dined here on at least seven previous occasions and was looking forward to my dinner this evening. Courteous hostess informs us of a 15 minute wait, we proceed to the bar for drinks and an appetizer, bartender is great table ready and the wheels fall off a great evening. My wife orders a salad with her entree it is brought to the table bagged \"to go\". I was craving my former favorite dish red beans and rice with andouille and greens, should be pretty simple for a NOLA themed restaurant. I don't even blink at $18 for beans, rice, greens and a sausage link because in the past it was delicious. Start with a bite of greens which were hot as expected moved on to a nice fork of red beans and an ice cold piece of sausage. Hmm if you locally source the sausage why is it frozen. After 5 minutes looking for the server I have her touch the frozen sausage and she asks me if I want her to \"nuke\" it. What??? If I wanted a microwave dinner I would have went to Giant Eagle and bought Sylvia's since I could not make it to NYC...please make me another. At this point I am calm, shit happens just make it right and I will continue to return. As my wife dines alone, I wait... when the redo arrives I am cautious in taking my first bite, certainly if something was sent back frozen this is going to be scorching. So I tentatively place a bite of ICE COLD!!!! sausage in my mouth again. Well they can't get the food temp up by they got my BP up. This is followed by the restaurant playbook of lame excuses, \"let me have the chef make it again\" - after the second time screwing up a simple plate don't call them a chef. \"Can I get you a drink?, \"We are going to comp this\" - Comp what? The bite of greens, I paid for my drink and apps at the bar. So the solution was to punt, comp my wife's dinner and a $25 gift card which I will never use because I am done - dining, drinking and recommending the Bourbon Street Barrel Room, (my wife can get Shrimp and Grits at SOHO) but I am not done writing reviews on to Urbanspoon and Open Table."}
{"text":"Never again! I was impressed upon walking in by the interior design but that was about the only thing we would end up enjoying. At first, the bartender seemed busy and didn't greet us but after 10 minutes we noticed her laughing with staff and we still hadn't received a greeting. When we asked about drink suggestions we were steered in the complete wrong direction and I don't even think the bartender took any of our likings into mind. The drinks had an artificial taste to them and were overly sweet. The food came out pretty fast but none of it could be modified because it wasn't made to order. Was pretty disappointed the fries and hush puppies came with sauce already slathered on them and we found most of our other food to be bland and dry. Some of the food also came out wrong but we were unable to inform the bartender as she was \"busy\" again talking with staff and showing excessive amounts of PDA. Very unprofessional. Sadly, we didn't enjoy a second of our dinning experience here and actually ended up making dinner at home seeing as no one had filled up at the train wreck they call The Bourbon Street Barrel Room."}
{"text":"Although I am a big fan of pasta, I didn't like mardi gras pasta. It was uncooked and without any special taste. It supposed to have oyster mushrooms. But I hardly found some small pieces of button mushrooms. Decoration was nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink early evening on a Thursday. Great bartenders, great atmosphere. The Vieux Carre' was excellent!  Recommended cocktail if you're a cocktail fan. I had the sweet potato waffle fries and a happy hour amber (fries and beer were $4 each).  Overall, the place and atmosphere, service and drinks, and the waffle fries were all winners!  And 30 beers on tap!?! I'll be back."}
{"text":"First impression is fantastic. Great decor and atmosphere. Clean and classy bar with a great selection of spirits and beer. My wife had a cucumber martini which was light and fresh. Not usually my type of drink, but it was something that I would order on a summer night. I opted for a couple different choices of bourbon.  As for the food, we all stayed with the traditional Louisiana fare. Jambalaya was just okay (I have had much better), but I consider where we were. The spicing was perfect for me, but my wife thought it was a little much. Andouille sausage might be my next choice. Lastly, we ordered desert. Wife had the creme brulee and loved it. I did the chocolate cheesecake and had plenty to share.   Recommend for drinks and appetizers.  Not bad for the price.  Make sure you use the valet parking."}
{"text":"Tasty Cajun food ... and especially good when served on the nicely appointed outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Met friends here this past week. Sat at the bar area. Service was good. Drinks were outstanding, the food was just ok. Good place to meet friends."}
{"text":"The red velvet cakes melts in your mouth. Gumbo came out quick and it is so delicious.  BBQ chicken. It very spicy and moist.  Everything was so good and service excellent.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened in Tremont and has a New Orleans Cajun/Creole menu. I highly recommend; the food was delicious, the drinks and service were on point, and the decor is beautiful. It was a fun, relaxing evening and I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I come here for happy hour on the reg. We admittedly haven't ordered anything from here except for their mixed drinks (ok), and their beignets (amazing). Get the beignets. You won't be disappointed. Three stars because a good majority of mixed drinks I've ordered were underwhelming, but the beignets terrific."}
{"text":"This is definitely new for the area and I couldn't wait to try it! I had the crescent combo it. The shrimp were good catfish not so much. Overall ok not horrible better than most but room for improvement with batter especially."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this restaurant and I cant wait to go back for more. The restaurant itself is beautiful and takes me back to the French Quarter with its decor. The menu and drink lists are extensive, and everything sounded so delicious when I was ordering. I am an avid fan of finding the perfect Po Boy (tough to do outside of the New Orleans region), and they came in at the top with theirs. It was so delicious and reheated nicely the next day for leftovers (way too much food). I only wish I had room for the beignets at the end. Guess I will just have to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice for lunch and it was pretty darn good. I am by no means an expert in this type of cuisine however, having never even been to New Orleans. The po-boy I've gotten twice has been very good, and the slaw type mixture that came with it was amazing."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful when you walk in. The decor works and you truly get a rustic southern feeling as soon as you walk through the door. The restaurant and bars (yes there are 2 bars) are decent sized for being located in Tremont! And yes, there are 2 sets of bathrooms! Wahoo! Their drink lists are extensive their bartenders are quick and polite.  I have been here 3 times now. The first time I came with a party of 8 and we were seated upstairs. We had an awesome waitress who really knew the menu and enjoyed talking with customers. She was very quick and with a large party that was unexpected. A brand new restaurant with prompt service? Management is definitely doing something right! Thank You!  The nice thing about going to restaurants with a large party is that you get to taste a lot of food that you normally wouldn't order. Our group ordered the Hot Legs, Hush Puppies. multiple versions of the You Pick 3, Andouille Sausage Po Boy, Ratatouille Royal, Cajun Jambalaya, Louisiana Crawfish Etouffee, Mardi Gras Pasta and the Jean Lafitte. A few food notes: The Hush Puppies and Cajun Jambalaya were by far the absolute BEST! I would go back for those 2 items. The Ratatouille Royal was a little bit of a letdown at our table because we thought it lacked flavoring. We also had a problem with the Louisiana Crawfish Etouffee in which the crawfish weren't cooked properly. I hope that this was just a new restaurant flaw.   I went for a second time with 14 girls and the food was much better with better seasoning. I am so happy they have worked out the kinks!  The third time was a charm. The waiter made great suggestions and stated his favorites when we asked what he recommended. He was quite the jokester and made our experience fun. Definitely try the frog legs to be bold and get the beignets for dessert! Warning!  The powdered sugar will get every where! I looked like the messiest diner!  Awesome Note: the chef also runs the Zydeco food truck!!"}
{"text":"Really an excellent experience. Ambience is really fun, two floors with cool art and jazz playing throughout. Had a couple Louisiana beers and also a Mint Julep which was done really well. Gator bites were super tender with great sauces to dip. Gumbo was fantasic I couldve eaten another whole bowl even though the portion sizes were generous. Barbecue shrimp and crawfish ettoufe were also very good but the Gumbo was my favorite. Service very friendly and food came out very fast. Will definitely return looking for a po boy next time"}
{"text":"Simply elegant and excellent. Look at the other pictures on Yelp and you'll see what I mean. Come here for dinner to taste what I mean.   We came here on a Friday night just before 6:00 expecting a wait. Took longer to give up on street parking and choose valet than it did to get a table.   The 2nd floor bar was packed, but many seats were open in the dinning rooms. Ordered the crab cake and hush puppies as apps. Both were delicious and came out quickly. Had the crawfish étouffée and shrimp creole for entrees, both were quick and good. I like my crawfish a bit spicier than served, but with tobasco on the table, no biggie.   We ordered the Cajun Bloody Mary and the class 5 hurricane from the bar. I latter got the mint julep. All three were good, with the mint julep bordering on spectacular. Our waitress was very attentive, but had to wait on the bar for drinks. They might want to think about one less server and add a bartender.   We had time for dessert, so we tried the beignets and the bourbon bread pudding. The donuts were a bit chewy, but the bread pudding pushed this review from 4 stars to 5. Next to Commanders Palace, it is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Being someone who has visited New Orleans, the food was pretty spot-on. The Shrimp Po-Boy was good, Gumbo had the right heat, and Bistro Sauce is addictive. Our server, Jennifer was great and what all servers everywhere should strive to be like.  The restaurant is beautiful and the patio is inviting. Went during lunch and happy hour prices were great too! Give it a try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here is really the star, it has gas lamps at all the tables and is a great place to mentally escape the cleveland winter. The beer selection is good, especially for Abita beers, and the nightly specials have some great deals. The biggest problem I've had is that the food is inconsistent between visits, I've ordered the muffaletta about five times and feel like I've had five different sandwiches, ranging from great muffaletta to something more resembling and ham and swiss sandwich."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place! I'm so happy that there's a New Orleans themed restaurant in the city. I visited with a bunch of my friends for my birthday, and though getting a table for 10 was a bit rough (not a place for big parties) the food was excellent. There were no complaints from anyone and I loved the choices for both food and drink.  I am a hush puppy freak and theirs are delicious accompanied by their special sauce. The \"hot rocks\" as well as the crunchy shrimp were probably my favorite food. I will be going back just to have drinks and dessert because I was too full to get dessert last time!"}
{"text":"I went to BSBR this past week for the first time and I'm glad I did. It was a Tuesday and the place had a nice crowd for a typically slow dining night.   I have to start with what everyone else has said...the space is gorgeous!  We toured the entire building and were quite impressed. The chandeliers and the wrought iron railings are stunning. I'm really looking forward to checking out the patio in the summer...there are heaters by some of the tables where you can just flip the switch to control it yourself. Perfect for me.   On to the food and drinks. I tried a couple of different drinks and they were both delicious. The one was a fizz which I loved. A drink with an egg white always makes me smile.    We started with the hush puppies which were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside like they should be. And wow, the sauce was good. For dinner I had the chicken po-boy which was also excellent. Highly recommend both items. And you must try the chocolate cheesecake. Amazing!  All around a great night."}
{"text":"Met up here with some extended family members on a Sunday night to celebrate my birthday...we had a wonderful experience!  The place is a bit on the loud side (due to the open air nature of the space, but it was also lively and vibrant.  On Sunday night all drinks (except beers) are $3 off, making for some very affordable cocktails.  We had an assortment including Hurricanes, Pims Cup and an Old Fashioned.  All were tasty.  The meal itself was outstanding...I ordered the fleur debris po boy sandwich which had tender roast beef served with a horseradish sauce and perfect bread (soft inside and slightly crisp outside in order to soak up the sandwich juices).  Also on Sundays is half price gumbo...so what the hey, we went for it! Turned out to be quite spicy and hearty with plenty of textures and flavors to enjoy.  But to me, the star dish of the meal was the voodoo mama...served with with two kinds of sausage, beans in a pool of flavorful sauce.  Not overly spicy, but plenty of kick from the meats included in the dish.  I really loved this plate.  To finish things off (and since it was a birthday celebration), we ordered beignets.  The beignets were a bit overcooked and firm (should have been softer and pillowy), not sure if that is their normal cooking style of if they were simply overdone.  Anyway, the overall ambiance of the space and food quality really hit the spot and made for an enjoyable evening.  And with all the dining specials they are offering, we'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! Try the mini hurricane, split hush puppies between a few people (delicious but heavy), sweet potato fries, and the pasta is good!"}
{"text":"By coming here I learned that I'm simply not a fan of cajun food. But! If you are this is the place for you. The atmosphere and creme brulee made up for the fact that I'm not a fan of gumbo. The food is REALLY good but like I said not really something my taste buds were used to.  I'll be back for hush puppies and dessert for sure!!"}
{"text":"Checked out several spots in Tremont over the weekend and started at BSBR.  Wow, beautiful décor, beers were tasty (and on happy hour even on Sat!) Had the Hot Rock (shrimp) and hushpuppies.  Shrimp was outstanding, hushpuppies I prefer to be spicier but still good.  Bartender was super nice and attentive.  Great spot will visit again!"}
{"text":"Decided to go some where new to watch the Browns game today, I Have had my eye on this spot since they started re doing the building. The entrance is really nice with lots of windows. The decor is new and colorful with a copper ceiling and a whole second floor! The service was great. No complaints. The craft draft selection was great and the drink list was awesome. We had the frog legs and hot rock shrimp. Both were great!  We shared a po boy sandwich with hush puppies, that too was great. Red skin potato was ok, I think the potatoes needed to be boiled a bit longer. Food came out fast. The only reason why I would give this spot five stars is that, I thought the entree selection was pretty much the same dishes and not enough meat selections. Plenty if you are vegan which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The cream brûlée was good too. And with that said, the food is reasonably priced. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Ok, in town from Pittsburgh and we tried this place , I've never written a bad review..but don't waste your time..chicken cold..and should be on the menu as dehydrated burbon chicken, cold sides, , wife's creole shrimp was horrible..the only 1/2 decent thing was dessert..skip this is place!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day yesterday. I was waking through Tremont  and ran into the inviting atmosphere of the Bourbon Street Barrel Room. Me n my fiance weren't super hungry so we shared the Hot legs (frog legs) and hot rocks (fried shirmp). Both were delicious!!! It was my first time trying frog legs and I'm glad it and done there, they were fried to perfection and the sauce and slaw that accompanied it was the icing on the legs lol. Anywho the service was on point and the open patio in the back was beautiful.... Can't wait to go try more of the menu. oh! And I can't forget about the mamosa's!!! Delicious!! For happy hour its 2$ off wine,beer,cocktails, and starters (appetizers s) so we took FULL advantage ......."}
{"text":"There is no where like this in CLE! I admit, I know nothing about cajun/creole food, but I'm pretty sure that the Bourbon Street Barrel Room knows EVERYTHING about it.  This place is stunning when you walk in. The copper ceilings are just gorgeous, the lighting great, and the art is pleasing. Our service was great - our waitress was very knowledgable and made great recommendations since I really am not familiar with the cuisine. She made great drink suggestions too based on what we told her we like. Our food came out steaming hot and the portion sizes were perfect. We enjoyed beignets for dessert (enjoyed isn't even the right word - those things were GOOD, like I dream about them still). I have absolutely no complaints about BSBR and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Christa. We just came from a bad experience at Fahrenheit and this place was amazing. Great food and they treated us to dessert because we had such a bad experience next door. Bourbon Street had amazing food, drink and dessert. Staff was great!i"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of New Orleans style food so this restaurant has been on my bucket list for some time! I'm so happy my husband and I made the trip. I got the shrimp creole and I could not imagine it being any more tasty. The patio was one of the better ones in Cleveland and the service was nice & quick."}
{"text":"Took my friend to dinner for his birthday.  The food was delicious.  The ambiance was wonderful.  The price was reasonable.  The service was GREAT.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on a sunday with my boyfriend. The food was great! The mimosas were even better! I look forward to trying their dinner options"}
{"text":"Had an office in Metterie La just outside of NOLA.  Loved that office and the food. BSBR has all kinds of great local favorites P.O. boys, gumbo, the fried shrimp is better than NOLA.  Top it off with off with a sugar cane root beer and I feel like i am transported.  Only wish they had char grilled oysters."}
{"text":"great atmosphere. professional people waiting on us. loved the creole food. try tremont scoops across the street for the closure of this meal also outstanding ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite bar/restaurant in town. From the atmosphere to the quality of the food, you will believe that you are in NOLA and not Cleveland. I have been here on multiple occasions and have never once had poor service. Every waiter/waitress has been knowledgeable and very friendly. Parking can be difficult, as it is mostly street parking, but this is the norm in Tremont. Drinks wise, they have a full bar that runs the gamut. My first trip here, I felt the need to have a Hurricane, a classic NOLA cocktail which was good, but a little too fruity for my taste. They have a wide array of options for bourbon, and in my experience a knowledgeable staff about their bourbons. Their beer list is heavy on Abita, an Louisiana craft brewery, but you can also find some CLE favorites. I have never had a bad meal here at any time of the day, but my most recent trip here was for brunch. I had the Cajun Jambalaya N' Eggs which is basically their dinner menu Jambalaya with eggs and bacon served with it. Outstanding meal that had enough spice without going overboard to lose flavor. I have tried a variety of their options and never once been disappointed. This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant ever since I moved to Cleveland. I have tried many others, and visited many good ones, but none could top BSBR. I'll be adding another review of their dinners the next time we venture over to Tremont."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food here is the atmosphere. It's been years since I've been to New Orleans but this restaurant felt absolutely authentic to me. Or, perhaps even better, it felt like a nostalgic fantasy of the city, complete with flickering gas lamps and wrought iron railings.   Beauty of the restaurant aside, the food is amazing. Come hungry and expect to leave just a little too full. They serve dishes laden with hearty food like shrimp and grits, jambalaya, gumbo, and red beans and rice. If you like cajun and creole cooking, you'll like BSBR's take on classics. If you've never experienced Louisiana-style cooking, this is a good place to start.   Intimate and cheerful, this can easily be a romantic spot. With two bars and two levels of seating, I suspect you can also have a great time with a large group of friends."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and have been disappointed both times.   First encounter:   My husband and I planned a dinner out with another couple and their children, selecting this place because NOLA is sentimental to all of us. Understanding that a table for 6 in Tremont can be difficult to wrangle, we called at 2:00 pm the same day to secure a reservation. We were told that a 6:30 reservation time wouldn't be needed because  that time is well before the restaurant ever gets busy.   When we showed up at 6:15, the restaurant was packed. Two of us had arrived, so we tried to put ourselves on the list to be seated. The gentleman at the hostess stand told us we had to wait because he \"had something else to do\" and someone would be with us soon. Ummmmm, OK.   The lady who came over a few minutes later told us we couldn't request a table until 75% of the party is present. We asked how long he expected wait would be once our party arrived, and the estimate was 20 minutes . That would have been fine if we had not been told earlier in the day that we wouldn't need a reservation. We explained our earlier interaction to the hostess, and were told that the restaurant doesn't even accept reservations. Wait, what??   Once our party arrived at 6:30, we were told 30 minutes. We went two rounds, trying to explain why we were upset. The hostess didn't try to make the situation right or even offer an apology for the confusion. We walked outside to discuss other restaurant options in the area, and ultimately decided not to stay. Upon walking into the hostess area to remove ourselves from the list, the hostess told us that a table just came available. Sadly, the 75% of our party was already in the car and on their way to the next spot. No effort was made to walk the 6' outside, where they could obviously see us standing, to tell us we would be seated   I understand that policy is policy, but the ENTIRE staff needs to understand the rules if they're going to be enforced.  Second encounter:  I got talked into trying again because my husband dying eat here. The staff was much better this time around. The food is not good. I had a $17-ish plate of shrimp and grits and guess what...? This place doesn't know how to make grits, not even expensive ones. There was very little flavor and the texture was like mashed potatoes. I realize that I live above the Mason Dixon line, but this isn't a difficult dish to make. The hush puppies were mediocre and far too small to be authentic. I really wanted to try the bread pudding, but I was afraid of being disappointed again.   (insert sad trombone here)"}
{"text":"Really yummy place! And they have great drink and appetizer deals. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for date night with my wife and we where not disappointed. Drinks are a little pricey but well worth it my wife raived over the Cajun Bloody Mary. We started with the Alligator bites and they were tasty but a little heavy on the breading so they tasted like chicken . My wife had the BBQ shrimp and grits and loved it. Zac our waiter helped me decide between the Pulled Pork and the Beef Po Boy (drum roll) I had the Pulled Pork and it was excellent. Over all we had an excellent experience and will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Order the Catfish Po' Boy!!! It was seasoned perfectly and the sandwich was a nice size too. We ordered it with a side of waffle fries with their bistro sauce which was good also. The drinks could have been a little bit better but since I went just for the food I won't fault them for the weak drinks. I'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Authentic gumbo that was delicious. I went with a small group so I tried the Shrimp Creole, Voodoo Mama and ordered the Shrimp Po Boy for myself with the Beignets for dessert.  Everything we ordered didn't take very long to come out. The gumbo came out first and although it was quick the flavor certainly wasn't lacking. You can tell a lot of time, energy and thought went into this lovely establishment down to the minute details. It's definitely one of kind and really transports you out of Cleveland as soon as you step inside from the street. The main dining area is flanked by balcony seating that opens up in the middle so you can see down below to the first floor. The copper ceilings and ornate pattern are also pretty cool to stare at. So if you want an all around great creole experience (that also boasts a solid craft beer menu, I had a goblet of Warlock Pumpkin Ale) for food, drink and ambiance this is the place to go. Apologies for my lack of photographic evidence. The food smelled so good that we inhaled it before anyone even thought about snapping photos. I'll get some next time as I will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great servers . Close as you can get to New Orleans. Cool space. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We go to New Orleans frequently and this place is as close you can get.  We went to brunch and each ordered omelettes; veggie with goat cheese and one with creole seafood.  YUM!!  Home fries were delicious, not at all greasy deep-fried dry.  Biscuits soft and fluffy.  The service was terrific!  We are definitely coming back for dinner when we are in town again."}
{"text":"I visited the Bourbon Street Barrel Room after recently returning from New Orleans, and wow, they really got it right! Everything from the color scheme to the architecture to the music, and of course, the food, sweetly sings \"NOLA.\"   My husband and I had a reservation for 6 pm on a Friday, which, I should note, is the latest that one can make a reservation on a Friday evening. The bonus about eating early? We still made it in time for happy hour - on a Friday! So, we ordered $4 beers and appetizers to kick off the night. The hush puppies are fresh, crispy, and delicious, served with a mayonnaise-based sauce that is creamy and decadent without being overwhelming. I ordered the crab cake burger, which was really just okay, but my husband ordered the shrimp and grits, which is truly what made our experience incredible. The shrimp were well-seasoned and succulent. I always have trouble describing grits, but let me just say - the grits were the way my southerner grandmother would have liked them."}
{"text":"My first enjoying the Sunday Brunch menu. Ordered the Chicken and French Toast. It was phenomenal. The chicken was crispy and juicy inside. The brioche was amazing served with maple syrup, blackberries and raspberries. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"ok, pretty good amount of nooks and crannies at this place. dont ask the serving staff what the difference between a nook and a cranny is, they wont know. also, pretty cool counterculture here. lost me at gator bites but found me at frog legs, if ya catch my drift. the jazz music was fitting for the scene and i particularly enjoyed the trumpet playing in the songs but did not care for any of the trumpet solos, it kinda sounded like an elephant was hungry and would not stop making noise, get that guy some frog legs already. ok, dont know why i'm not using capital letters to start out sentences. ok, i would suggest this place, the food and atmosphere were quality. good day mate!"}
{"text":"The service was good for being crowded and or group being a large party. As for the food it was just okay for the most part, some was good some was really not. Frittes (French fries) were hard as rocks. Drinks were tasty and fun. I enjoyed my plate of catfish and shrimp, hush puppies were good, fried oysters were good, the deserts were delicious (beignets and bread pudding + ice cream). However, my sister did not care for her shrimp and grits and my mom did not like her gumbo."}
{"text":"Friday night happy hour, althou they don't have one. Bring lot's of money with you. The craft cocktails are fabulous.  The staff made me feel very comfortable as I drank and ate alone.  The atmosphere and menu is straight out of New Orleans.  You have got to see to beleive.  Don't worry about finding parking, valet it, $6.00."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service.  Very friendly and hospitable.  A great place to take your family or friends for birthdays or  happy hour."}
{"text":"Bourbon Street Barrel Room has to be one of my favorite restaurant finds ever since moving to Cleveland last year! Having grown up eating a fair amount of Cajun and Creole food, I was very excited to discover this place! They have everything you'd expect, from gator bites (so good!), to jambalaya, po'boys, and beignets. I'm absolutely in love with the Cajun style jambalaya, which is exactly like what I grew up with! Cajun style is different from Creole style in that it does not use a tomato sauce-but you can add tomato sauce at the restaurant to make it more Creole style. I do like my chicken a little spicier, but that's just personal taste. There's some house hot sauce on the table that goes well with the jambalaya, so I just put some of that in. We went back for my birthday with a small group of friends, and they all enjoyed their variety of dishes as well. Everything is plated beautifully, and the colors and textures of the foods look as good as they taste. We were lucky on my birthday that they were holding a special on mini hurricanes, so we all got one of those as well. I also appreciated that they made mine with vodka rather than rum, and it was fantastic! Hurricanes tend to sneak up on you because they don't taste like strong alcohol, so this size was perfect for dinner time with friends. They do have a wide variety of alcohols to choose from, especially beers-so check that out if beer is your thing! Finishing up the meal with perfectly made beignets (think along the lines of a thick and somewhat chewy fried dough) and creme brûlée was the perfect ending. We can't wait to find another excuse to go back! The atmosphere is vibrant and fun with atmosphere lighting, a gorgeous chandelier, and gas lanterns on the second floor. There is beautiful detailing from the ceiling to the ironwork."}
{"text":"I visited on a night when they randomly lost power for a bit. The staff was amazing calm, professional and even took my number to call me when the power was back on and they were seating again. Once seated, the place was amazing close to a real NOLA experience, staff was friendly and professional. The food was good, could have been a bit spicier, but authentic! The prices are great! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here before watching the cavs game. The drinks were very good, I had the King Cup or something like that. It was a very sweet drink. We shared an app and one entree. It was ok, cooked good no complaints. We had fried shrimp app and a catfish Po boy with hush puppies. The bar tender was ok, not really friendly."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere was great, and my boyfriend loved his food but I thought mine was just okay. I would get he jambalaya appetizer and hush puppies again but I wasn't crazy about the po boys though my boyfriend loves the andouille sausage.  Creme Brûlée though was awesome and the beignets looked good as well. Brunch menu looks promising so I would return for brunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service. Food was extremely good and the presentation was excellent. I have never seen real gas burning lanterns used inside and outside of a restaurant. I ate a sandwich and my wife had a seafood plate and she loves seafood!! This place is a must see!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience from start to finish! Jambalaya was extraordinary! Next time  I'm saving room for dessert! Maybe they will even have Bananas Foster???"}
{"text":"Went here a few times, always had great service, food and the drinks are amazing. The last time I went it was a birthday celebration. somehow I forgot my credit card with the server.  Not only did the very nice server try to find me on facebook the very next day, to return my card, she facebooked me and told me where I had left it.  I thought that was very nice of her.  I would surely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Seeing that Mardi Gras had just passed, finally the perfect time had come to visit this place! The ambience in this place is good, makes you feel that you aren't in Cleveland anymore! We came here for a birthday celebration for my mother and we all were happy with our choice of venue. But now to the more important stuff...the FOOD! Pictured below are a couple of the dishes that we ordered, from fried oysters, seafood, hot legs (frog legs) jambalaya, gumbo, voodoo wrap, blackened chicken P.O.' boy and the big easy chicken entree! Everything was good. My favorite dishes were the jambalaya and the blackened chicken P.O boy with Cajun fries! Highly recommend if you're looking for some flavorful Louisiana Cuisine try this place out!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Doesn't feel as intimate or nostalgic to NO as some are making it out to be, but still impressive two-story open feel. Didn't really notice woodwork/ironwork others are talking about but maybe wasn't paying enough attention.  I did notice the music which was quite the throwback playlist, not fitting the vibe.  Cost: 2. Portions are relatively small (which isn't a bad thing) versus some competing restaurants in area that stuff you with fries etc.  Main dishes in $10-15 range and reasonable appetizer cost, which is on-par or slightly above most casual dining in Tremont.  Food Quality: 3. Wide variety of hot sauces which was appreciated.  Enjoyed the hot frog legs for an appetizer.  Beyond that, the Jambalaya and Ratatouille main dishes we both had were o.k. but a tad on bland side.  Based on other reviews out there now would have gotten Creole or Crawfish main dishes.  Service: 4. Being a new restaurant place was still working out kinks but good service for the most part.  Kitchen a little slow given how empty it was, but maybe that plays into \"southern\" feel.  When to return: Craving for New Orleans-style cuisine. Happy hour. Refreshing change from classic Tremont/Ohio City gastropubs (Nano Brew, Tap House, Southside, etc.)."}
{"text":"When I walked it, I loved the atmosphere! I was super excited, but when it came down to the food...not impressed what so ever. I've worked in the food industry and would be embarrassed to serve that food. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits, and it was very bland. We had to add hot sauce and salt to make it better. I got the muffaletta and I sent it back because they forgot the olive/veggie mix  that makes it a muffalatta, and the kitchen manager comes out with it saying how there was some on there but she gave me extra. Inaccurate.  There was zero on there, and the extra she brought out was boring and didn't seem like there was any olives on the mix, just some chopped veggies. Beer selection was good and our bartender was very nice and took my sandwich off the bill. We will will not be going back."}
{"text":"Walk right into the New Orleans style restaurant with many daily specials to choose from. The environment is very traditional of Louisiana. You almost forget you're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Was not very impressed with the food. I had the voodoo wrap which I believe has the jambalaya inside of it which was over seasoned and I'm not referring to spicy which I enjoy but it had this powerful woody flavor almost like wayyy too much rosemary and thyme. My wrap came out without the cheese so I asked for the goat cheese on the side. The sauce that it was served with was good and the frites were wonderful. Benet's and creme brûlée were good but I wouldn't go back for the food based on the wrap hat I had."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The owner loved New Orleans so much that he traced the railings and lights during his visit and had them recreated for the restaurant. He also swayed the chef to move to Cleveland.   Good food with some vegan options. Lots of drinks. The black bean hummus was to die for."}
{"text":"I'm giving BSBR 3 stars but I'm floating between 2-4.  4 Stars for ambiance.  Quite frankly this is a gorgeous space!  It reminds me of NOLA and well, as I said, it is GORGEOUS.  Music however, lame.  I was there on a night without live music, and the canned music was boring and not in the spirit of NOLA.  If you're going to have a NOLA-style restaurant, keep the theme going and hook me up with some sweet jazz, or something!  2 Stars for food.  The Hush Puppies arrived quickly, but were not crispy on the outside, and were kind of bland.  My friend got a salad with fried oysters on it, which looked delicious and she enjoyed it.  My shrimp creole was, again, bland, and without life.  I felt like I could have done something better at home.  And quite frankly, I was hoping for a New Orleans style boil, and nothing like it on the menu.  4 Stars for drinks.  The hurricane was not like the one I've had before, but my, oh, my this one will knock you on your feet and was wonderful!  I didn't have desert, but I'd be willing to go back to try that and hope for better success than the food.  Valet parking the night I went was $6 and you got a \"free\" car-wash when you picked up your car at the end of the evening.  Loads of sea-food on the menu, and not a ton of veg options, so beware if you're Vegan / Veg friendly.  Would I recommend BSBR?  I can't say that I wouldn't, but I think there are some kinks that need worked out.  I'd be willing to give it 1 more shot, but not more.... or, maybe just stick to the drinks."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is always amazing. I love the personality we find there. Every time I go for a meal I enjoy it all, from the atmosphere, to the staff. They always have something new on draft, which I love. I recommend this spot to people all the time."}
{"text":"Great place! New Orleans in Cleveland! Ambience, music and delicious Creole cooking! A+!  Shioban is an excellent server! Come check it out! Worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"It amazes me how quickly a great restaurant can become terrible. We ate here about a year ago and it was great. Tonight we started our visit by being told it was a 45-60 minute wait. After 1 1/2 hours our party of five was wedged into a table for four; when I asked the hostess if we could move to an open larger table she was rude, inconsiderate and clearly could give a damn about our wait. The worst part was a party of six who arrived after us was seated before us. Clearly a restaurant who wants throughput with no consideration to service. We finally ordered and when our food arrived it was terrible. My daughters muffalatta sandwich was burnt, my mother in laws food was wrong, my jumbalaya was mushy and garnished with cold shrimp.  Save your money and make jumbalaya at home using a box mix like zatarans. Our total time wasted was over 3 hours for a terrible meal.  With all the great restaurants in tremont they have a ton of work to do to compete. Too bad; it used to be quite good. We will not be back and would highly recommend unless you want to wait three hours for mediocre food, skip it!!!"}
{"text":"The place is stunningly beautiful and the food is awesome. Drink menu is fantastic with great cocktails and flights of beer. The red velvet torte is to die for, as are the hush puppies... as soon as we left I was dying to go back."}
{"text":"Tell your friends about this place and THEY'LL tell their friends. This restaurant had a large selection of drinks and the food had a kick; never been to New Orleáns but would have to say-the dim lighting, flickering torch lights and spicy good food made this place a top choice for a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Tastes just like NOLA and atmosphere makes you think you are in NOLA!!  Must visit!! Great date restaurant or even family restaurant!!  Very update and great service!  Love the sweet potato fries and must have beignets with Cafe Au Lait!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. There was only a 15 minute wait to be seated. We sat at the bar and the bartender was fast and very friendly. The drinks were delicious and the selection was outstanding. When we got sat, the server was very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is amazing. Feels like you are in New Orleans! The food choices were varied and delicious. My entree was huge! This place is worth visiting with friends for a special occasion. Everything was delicious and the service was great. I highly recommend it! Big shout out to our server Zach, for being so attentive and friendly in celebrating my friend's birthday. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for he NOLA experience in CLE, than stop by the Bourbon Barrel Room.  I have been to New Orleans many times and this place does it justice.  Try the Sazerac!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to go when I lived in Cleveland!! I miss the food and the music and the drinks. Definitely try the gator bites and fried oysters. The poboys are all pretty good. And the gator juice is the best cocktail! The bread pudding is TO DIE FOR!! The salmon entree was my fav. I wasn't a fan of the gumbo or jambalaya, but I was born and raised in New Orleans and am hard to please when it comes to those dishes. Anyway, hope you enjoy as much as I did!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party on Sat.   The atmosphere is great. There is an upstairs bar with a balcony, great artwork, lovely chandeliers. Very sexy, romantic. I even mentioned that I felt like I was on vacation in New Orleans!  Although, as another review mentioned, annoying music...kind of quick paced Louisiana style music (not sure what the genre is called!) I get what they are trying to do, but a slower blues or jazz music could have kept the theme without sounding too cheesy for the lovely atmosohere. Also...take down the mardi gras beads from the pretty chandeliers and the ironwork on the top balcony. Unnecessary...  The food was wonderful and beautifully presented. I ordered the raw oysters and the chocolate chesecake...mmm! My boyfriend's gumbo was great and the jambalaya was ok. After years of denial and talking myself into liking Creole food, I've come to the consensus that I just do not like it. I didn't particularly like the jambalaya, but he said it was very good. So, rather than take off any stars or simply state it wasn't tasty to me, I've made peace with that fact that my problem with Creole food is just that, my problem.   Overall, very good. Will be back for some frog legs!"}
{"text":"Great bar staff with a strong knowledge of the menu and more importantly, strong knowledge of the brews on tap. Mira was an awesome bartender. Easy to talk to and joke with and again, very knowledgeable about he menu. I didn't eat but my brother had the Muffaletta. I'm assuming it was good because he cleared the entire plate, not a fry left. Great decor. Overall I dig this establishment and will come back again next time I'm in the Tremont area."}
{"text":"Personally, this might be my favorite spot in Cleveland. Between the atmosphere, prices, beer selection, and menu, there are few places that can compete in the Cleveland area. It's a Louisiana style kitchen with choices like po boys and jambalaya. The po boys I've had here are the best in the area. I also highly recommend the frog legs as an appetizer, as those are the best I've had anywhere. The beer selection is fantastic and always changing; you'll be able to try something new every time you come. Beer flights are also an option at an affordable price. The back patio is beautiful but the inside is decorated New Orleans style and there is some really cool seating in there. This is always the first place I recommend to people looking for somewhere new in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Loved the mood here. The interior definitely feels like you've walked into the French Quarter in New Orleans! They have beautiful ornamental metals surrounding the top floor and intricate chandeliers. The second floor has a very intimate and romantic feel, and as I understand, the front porch opens up in the summertime too.  We came around 9pm on a Saturday night and had a short wait of about 15 min. We ordered a few drinks and appetizers. They have quite a selection of bourbons and whiskeys. It was a rough night for our waitress - it had been busy all day so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, but she wasn't sure what some of the drinks were. Also, some of the whiskeys that we requested were out. They were very generous and gave me the last portion of the whiskey that dried up on the house and then fulfilled my order for another drink.  The food was good to fill up on while going out for drinks, though I can't say it was very memorable. They have a New Orleans menu with alligator bites, hush puppies, gumbo, and hot rocks (shrimp), but most of it didn't really have that much flavor.   Come here for the mood and the drinks!"}
{"text":"Where Yat C-Town? Authentic New Orleans food cooked to perfection from a Baton Rouge native. Hurricanes on point. Jambalaya is amazing, especially the andouille in it. Make sure to finish off with a beignet ya hurdz meh!                        Who Dat!"}
{"text":"I have a very special place in my heart for the food of the great city of NOLA so I had very high expectations. I will also say that one of my most favorite dishes is the Debris at Mothers in NOLA. I checked out this place during the winter for dinner on a busy Saturday night and was in shock to see the Debris PO Boy. That with some house made hot sauce and an Abita IPA, and I was totally in. The debris is incredibly tender and very flavorful. I made the mistake of splitting one with my boyfriend, because we both wanted our own. We loved it so much that we went for brunch the very next day. And don't skip out on the beignets for dessert! They did an incredible job with that space."}
{"text":"Once again,  this place rocks! A wonderful lunch/brunch!  Desserts, oohs and ahhs! I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH!"}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions while the food is ok, I'm giving this low rating because a person in a wheelchair can't eat here."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party and had a great experience! The atmosphere of this restaurant is amazing. I love the dim lighting and overall cozy feel of it. It makes me feel like I'm in NOLA! There is an upstairs area that can accommodate larger parties. I ordered the crawfish etouffee. This was superb! I love the spicy and savory taste of the dish! The portion was huge too! I anticipated taking half of it home, but ended up eating the entirety of the dish because it was so delicious! I had a bite of my friend's catfish sandwich, which was perfectly crispy and flavorful! We also had a side of beignets for everyone to share. It definitely rivals the ones you get in NOLA. The service was also amazing!   Overall, I had a great experience here and I'll be coming back soon :)"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars.  While I loved the ambiance, and the service was great, I think I ordered the wrong thing. The muffalleta just left a lot to be desired.  The meat wasn't sliced thin enough.  The bread was not as good as the Italian bread that you get in New Orleans.  And something just tasted off.  Not terrible, but not what I expected.    That said, the Bloody Mary was fantastic, served with a sidecar of Abita Amber and a garnish of shrimp and oyster on the side.    I also tried a hush puppy happy hour app, which was delicious.    My dining companions loved their food.   If I were here again I would not order the same thing.  They do have some nice happy hour specials, but I wasn't into any of the drinks on happy hour special.  I was tempted by the Pimm's Cup, but the description seemed a little off, as well.....not traditional. Everything else (non-happy hour) looked pretty good.    To sum it up: the Bloody Mary is where it's at.  Get that."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food. The gator juice cocktail is spectacular."}
{"text":"Favorite bar/restaurant in Tremont by far. The food is always amazing, and great atmosphere for your group of friends."}
{"text":"Fun drinks, good happy hour and specials, nice atmosphere and decor. Wish food was more authentic to Louisiana"}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot, felt like you were in New Orleans with the art work and second floor balcony area. The upstairs portion was where we were, and it was a cool atmosphere. We didn't eat here so I can't speak to the food, but the bud light I had aw pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has a very cool ambiance - when you're inside, it feels like you've stepped into a French Quarter restaurant. The gas lanterns, flour-de-lis wallpaper, tin ceilings, wrought iron railings and gas lanterns scream New Orleans charm.   It does get busy around dinner time, but there's tons of seating - even on the large patio. However, they don't take reservations or call-ahead seating, which is pretty frustrating and eliminates it as a convenient option for planned gatherings.   I've been for both dinner and brunch, and I have to say, brunch is my favorite of the two. All of the food I've tasted there so far is very good and authentic. As for cocktails, I'd recommend the sazerac.   Lastly, the prices are very reasonable and they have great happy hour specials. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we had a friend visiting in from Pittsburg. So we wanted her to see Tremont during the afternoon since the weather was nice out!   We love the way it looks on the inside. Great feel and design. The food came out really quick which was great and it was not crowded.   For our shared starters we chose the pomme frites. I never had \"hush puppies\" before and they were delicious with an awesome dipping sauce! My fiance ordered the \"Oyster on the half Shell\" and it was very apatizing and be sure to ask for horse radish because it is a must. My friend Megan ordered the \"Shrimp Creole\" and I sampled it even though I don't really care for shrimp. It was perfectly tender with a nice tomato sauce over steamed rice. I myself order \"Johnny's Famous gumbo\" which is a great size to share with a partner. It was not my favorite because the sausage.  This was a cool place to check out in a weekday!   Cheers-"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant!  Everything is so cool from the decors to the drinks to the food to the service.   The drinks are amazing. The staff told me that they have ancient secret cocktail recipes from New Orleans.   I have spent a lot of time in New Orleans and it's hard to imagine that a restaurant that is not in New Orleans could be so authentic.   Can't wait to come back next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place was great! The food was yummy and It brought me back to the days of eating in the south. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this restaurant.  I love the atmosphere and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Johnny's Famous Gumbo!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for the first time with a few friends last week and I was really impressed.  It was a Monday and the special was $5 burgers and then an additional $2.50 to add fries or hush puppies.  Once I heard that I was sold!   We also were there in time for happy hour and it was $3 and I believe half off apps.  They had a great draft list and what looked to me as an awesome menu.  The vibe around was very friendly, seemed like a great place to stop up for a beer at the bar or a date with a significant other.    For a creole/cajun type restaurant I wasn't expecting for them to have a killer burger but they did!  Prepared to order, high quality, and juicy meet.  You also got to pick your cheese and toppings include this aioli type sauce I could not get enough of.  All of them weren't an extra cost either how it usually is on a burger night.  I left STUFFED, didn't even finish my burger, and very pleased.  I will be back for burger night and to try something more their specialty off the menu."}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans and needing a little Mardi Gras in my life decided to check out The Bourbon Barrel.  So glad I did, I honestly felt like I was in the French Quarter!  Extremely friendly hostess, which also reminded me of home.  The Hurricanes were great!  We had a shrimp appetizer, fried oysters, shrimp and grits, beignets and bread pudding.  All were fantastic!  The owner has definitely done his research.  Our server Peter was excellent!  I have been in the industry for over 30 years and I have to say he could not have done a better job!  I can't wait to return and I will recommend to all of my friends and coworkers.  Thanks for bringing a little bit of my home to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor is great!!! Drinks are also very creative and good!! I have been there twice and food is fine...will I be back...yes...but because of the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just wow from ambiance to service to great food the only issue I had was being a big guy in a booth not very comfortable but the jambalaya will nock your socks off parking is a little Challenging but a little walk will make you feel better after you over eat"}
{"text":"Surprisingly authentic food from the Pimm's Cooler through the Beignets. Of course the seafood isn't as bountiful or fresh as it is on the Gulf, but the basic recipes are intact. Service was pleasant and the space is beautifully designed."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Coolest place in Tremont! Must go! Upper bar with Andrew is \"the place\". Owner is onsite, friendly with his eye on every detail! Authentic New Orleans meets Cleveland! Tastefully done!  Food is outstanding!  Can't wait to go back!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah!  I can't wait to return to BSBR.  This place was great, the food, atmosphere, location and service.  The owner(s) really did their homework.  BSBR has been on my short list of places to try for some time.  Finally got the opportunity to go, this past Saturday evening.  A girlfriend and I arrived at approx 7:00, valet parked, no wait for seating.  We were seated in a booth along the outer edge, which was perfect for people watching.  Our server Courtney was AWESOME, very personable.   We each ordered the Planter's Punch, which was a yummy mix of spiced rum and various fruit juices.  We also ordered the pick 3 appetizer sampler and I ordered the BBQ pork Po'boy with hushpuppies and she ordered the Muffaletta with pomme frites.  We chose red beans (a bit salty, but still tasty), gumbo (yummy) and shrimp (double yum),  Portions were perfect for sharing and everything was tasty.   The sandwiches, OMG, the Sandwiches!   My Po'boy arrived on fresh bread, tender shredded pork, just enough sauce and homemade citrus slaw.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed the Muffaletta, it was huge.  I REALLY wanted beignets, but I was so full, I could not have eaten another bite.   This was a great choice and a great meal!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of space this bar and it has some great decor. Two floors, plenty of bar space and an overall nice atmosphere. Has some fried shrimp and they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time a couple weeks ago & LOVED everything about it...from the valet service to the food & everything in between! Everyone was friendly! We came on a busy Saturday night, the hostess had told us it would be a half hour (which only ended up being about 15 minutes), we sat at the bar while waiting for a table & the bartender & drinks were great! Our server was fantastic and friendly (and fast), our food came out very quickly and everything was delicious! We will definitely be back & we have already told lots of ppl!"}
{"text":"Food was great and I loved the atmosphere. We had a pretty big crowd and they accommodated for us really well."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, some of the best food I've ever had and great service. Reasonably priced, enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"We tried Bourbon for the first time last weekend for my partner's birthday. Tremont was happening that evening because of some kind of beer festival. The restaurant didn't seem too crowded and we were seated on the patio almost immediately. The selection of drinks was large and we both got mixed drinks which arrived quickly and were presented very well.  After we ordered food however the service became increasingly slow, apparently due to the amount of activity in the area.  When the food did arrive it was very good.  Overall I would recommend trying Bourbon but just be aware that the kitchen seems to me to get overwhelmed on a busy night."}
{"text":"I have been here many, many times. I have had tables and sat at the bar. My food and service has always been phenomenal. I love the atmosphere. The decor is awesome. My daughter loves it here as well. I give it a solid"}
{"text":"I was in the area for business and decided to try out BSBR. It was not really a good decision, unfortunately. I arrived around 10:15 pm on a weeknight. I was the only person in the restaurant. Per their website, they serve the full menu until 11:00 pm and then the late night menu until 2 am. However, they told me I could only order off the late night menu and when I left, they would be closing. Okay... I understand they weren't busy but if it's a chronic issue, then adjust the operating hours.  I got a glass of wine, the Big Easy. It was $13 a glass so I was expecting a great wine. I guess because it is the most expensive on the menu, it must not get ordered often. The initial pour was much too oxidized, it had that broken down, not quite port flavor. I asked for a glass from a new bottle and I was obliged. The wine wasn't very good, I'd remove it from the menu, there are much better wines out there. Maybe it's only on the menu because of the name?   I ordered a starter of the jambalaya and then the shrimp po boy. I guess this was sort of a blessing because I was going to get the jambalaya off the regular menu. It was good but it's not traditional jambalaya, it's just dirty rice with Andouille. The flavor was fine but I would have liked some more vegetables and maybe more of a kick to it. The po boy...yikes. I would not eat the shrimp here unless you love that chlorine taste. Even with the deep fried breading, it was still overwhelming. It was so bad that I kind of hid some of the shrimp underneath the bread to make it look like I ate more than I did. The tomatoes on the sandwich were mealy and there was barely any lettuce. They also gave me complimentary hush puppies which were good, I guess? Hushpuppies are just fried cornmeal, I'm not sure how it's possible to make it taste any different."}
{"text":"Way crazy N'awlens place!  Had frog legs for the first time and they were freaking delicious!  Then the meal came!  What what!!  Outstanding shrimp and grits!  Gotta go back to sample more stuff!  Great place, great price, great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 4 times now. I will forever come back here even if just for the visual. This place is grogeous. The lanters, focused decor, furniture, and colors are amazing. It feels so warm and welcoming similar to a speakeasy vibe but much larger. The 2 floors make it so unique and the upstairs has its own bar and bathrooms. Did I mention they take reservations? Rare in our city and much appreciated.   Happy hour and daily specials is another reason to head in to BSBR. Great value for the price. On my most recent visit and others we have ordered hush puppies, catfish po-boy, sweet potato fries, jambalaya, gumbo, gator bites, etc. Food is good but nothing to write home about if I'm being honest. Its not what brings me in but it fills ya up. The spinach salad is always good but not super filling even when ordering the large. Best things are the sweet potato fries, beignet's and drinks!!!   I'll continue to bring people here when they visit the city for the ambiance and after work drink specials too. The service is always friendly and the crowd here is diverse and welcoming. Families, to co workers, to elderly....honestly everyone whether you are drinking, eating, or both. I also attended a private event upstairs once for a charity fundraiser and they handles out crowd well and the separation was really nice with the separate bar so keep that in mind when looking for a space to host!"}
{"text":"Only been to NOLA New Orleans Louisiana once, but I think I found it in the 216 town.   Ambience. . 10 Style...........  10. Classy and southern swank! Service.......  10, ask for Curtis! Not only is he adorable, but he knows the menu, Cocktails, desserts and all! Outdoor patio. ... 10 and you can enjoy sun, shade of an umbrella or even, the flick of a switch...heat! Attire acceptable as you are... 10 Food variety....   10 Cocktail selection. ... 10  So no matter what we ordered, we were pleased.  Happy hour has $2 off alcohol and appetizers.   Appetizers were plentifil, no need for entrees but my eyes were loong as they were brought out to others.  Lookit my photos... delicious delovely... mmm, mmm good."}
{"text":"We are here on Mardi Gras and it is the busiest day of the year for them. Waiting for a table took 15 minutes and we had seats and a hurricane sooo no trouble!  We were seated l, placed our order and the first item ( honestly great gumbo) came out and on our table maybe 5-7 minutes. Our crawfish boils came next, fresh crawdads cooked just right with a great amount. Our service with Zack was spot on. Overall this place was ready for a crowd and they delivered"}
{"text":"Before you walk into the place there is a gas lamp that hangs over the entrance way. Once you walk in there are many gas lamps on one wall of the restaurant opposite the bar. They are really cool to look at. The service was quick and friendly. They have a delicious hum-as and sour dow bread.  We ate a vegan wrap, but the restaurant doesn't understand-what vegan means. They put a goat cheese in a vegan wrap and on the sweet potato waffle fries they added a mayo chipotle drizzle. They replaced the waffle fries and we removed the goat cheese from the wrap. It was very tasty. Lots of interesting beers to choose from. I enjoyed all three that I tried. This place had a nice ambiance, good service, but poor understandings vegan. I would still recommend trying it, but if your a vegan be clear about what you want and don't want. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Great NOLA atmosphere. Come on Sunday is relaxed. The staff is gracious and pleasant. Enjoy the drinks stay for the food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good drinks. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the shrimp po boy. We both had several drinks which I cannot remember the names of.  I love the layout and decor of the place. We sat at the bar and had excellent service."}
{"text":"The curb appeal & decor will lure you in, but once inside the menu is a hit or miss. This is my 3rd time returning and giving another chance, still disappointed. The cocktails are subpar (with the exception of the Bloody Mary) so I recommend ordering a beer or glass of wine instead. Food is hit or miss - the roasted chicken was drier than my liking & shrimp & grits was lacking in the flavor department. If your looking for a great meal in this neighborhood there are much better options to choose from."}
{"text":"I love this place I visit it frequently and always try something new the food is so amazing you have to try this place"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Friday. The service was great and the food and drink menu was extensive. The place was pretty packed for lunch but the kitchen stayed on top of everything and we had a great experience."}
{"text":"I suppose I should preface this review with a bit of a disclaimer. I've never been to Louisiana. What I know about New Orleans and the French Quarter I've learned from popular culture, the media, movies and from watching way too much Food Network. I'm sure that some of what I've learned is inaccurate stereotyping but I'm also sure that some of it's true. Either way, I guess what I'm trying to say is that in this review I won't be railing against the establishment for not being \"authentic\" or \"true to the culture\" because I don't have first-hand experience in these areas. What I do know is what I like and BSBR is a whole lotta that.  Yes, the other Yelpers have nailed it. The restaurant is beautiful. As soon as you walk in you're grabbed by what I can only describe as transformative design at its best. From what I hear it took them 15 months to build it out. It really does feel like you've been taken somewhere far from Cleveland. The attention to detail is everywhere - the crystal chandeliers, the wood plank flooring, marble bar top, the wrought iron scrollwork that carries from the outside balcony and its shutter-flanked French doors to the inside, live gaslights on the walls, the pressed tin ceiling tiles - it's truly beautiful. Add to this the way they've created an open-air dining experience inside by elevating a second dining area and bar overlooking the main floor and it's hard not to be impressed. You can tell that a great deal of time, money and love went in to making this a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.  We were greeted by the friendly hostess upon arriving and escorted upstairs to our table overlooking the central bar and foyer. Our two-top was perfectly located to give us a view of the entire dining room and just enough out of the way that it felt like we had the entire place to ourselves. Our server was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the menus, both bar and food. Speaking of the bar, this is the real deal. I'm talking mixology here, not simply slinging well drinks. House-made mixers, bitters and simple syrups crafting cocktails befitting a French Quarter neophyte like myself - Hurricanes, Mint Juleps, Vieux Carres, Gator Juice(?) - I get buzzed just typing the names. As a beer guy, though, I was gobsmacked by their 30-tap selection including 5 Abita selections (they are from LA, after all) and several locals like Fat Head's and Platform. If you can't get drunk here you're not trying very hard.  Did I mention that I don't really know all that much about Cajun or Creole food? Not to worry. I was in good hands here. Chef Johnny (a la food truck Zydeco Bistro) is a Baton Rouge native and you can taste the love he has for his roots in every bite. The worst part of our experience was having to decide what to order. Frog's legs, shrimp etouffee, jambalaya, alligator piquant, po boys, muffaletta, the list goes on.   Everything we ate was delicious. From the addictively good crispy golden hush puppies drizzled with the sweet heat of the house Bistro Sauce to the tender pieces of alligator swimming in the deftly balanced sweet and sour spice of the sauce piquant. We couldn't stop ourselves. The catfish po boy was mouthwatering with just the right amount of crispy breading encasing the tender, white fish. There's something about the slightly muddy flavor of catfish that I love. Next, a side of ratatouille, perfect peasant food in rough-chopped squash, zucchini and tomatoes. I ordered the jambalaya and if this is what Creole food is supposed to taste like, all other renditions I've had in the past were blurry facsimiles. The dirty rice, cooked perfectly, just a bit toothsome, was filled with spices and the Andouille sausage grilled with a slight char. The heat level was perfect and built to a slow, pleasant burn.  After all that we still had room for dessert and, of course, we went for the Beignets. A great way to end the dinner. Puffy fried pastries dusted with copious amounts of powdered sugar and served with fresh berries.  I don't really know all that much about Cajun versus Creole and I have never set foot on Bourbon Street, but I know when something just feels right. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left with full bellies and Hurricane and beer-induced grins, our experience at BSBR was more just just another night out at a restaurant. It felt like we had somehow managed to wander out of our city and into someone else's where we were guests that they had long been expecting. I don't care all that much about whether or not something is \"authentic\" or exactly like it is in the city that inspired its creation. What I Do care about is how a place makes me feel and, damn, this do feel good."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. This place was mindblowingly delicious.   Not only am I super sad I didn't even know this place excited until recently, but I am ELATED that I only have to drive 40 minutes for some bomb and authentic Cajun food.   I obviously ordered the gumbo. How can you NOT come to a Cajun restaurant and order something else? It was SO GOOD. I do with corn bread was served with it over sour dough bread, but I got over that super fast because it was SO DELICIOUS! You could taste so many different depths of flavors, and the House hot sauce was great to get it to a spice level of my liking! It was so good I literally ate the entire bowl (it's huge) and had no regrets. Lol   The drinks are also phenomenal, and you definitely get more than you pay for. The jambalaya, hush puppies, and sweet potato waffle fries were also superb.   I can't wait to come back and eat my feelings again! It's hard to come by a restaurant that specializes, and succeeds, in true comfort food."}
{"text":"Such a fun vibe! Decorated with beautiful chandeliers and shiney ceiling tiles. Good beer selection which includes Abita, a Louisiana staple. Love the hurricane! Has lots of bar seats, and a bar upstairs. Nice patio that I'm excited to try in the spring. I had a small gumbo for $4.50. They have late night to-go food until 1am, so I am done needing to go to Edison's! Also had a mushroom pasta (yum) and some hot shrimp appetizer (yum yum)! They don't take reservations but my party of 5 was seated fast. Everyone loved their meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet potato fires as the appetizer and  vegetables and rice dish. They have a vast and comprehensive drink menu. They have specials from Sunday to Thursday, which I recommend trying.   The service was excellent and very fast. Definitely a gem in Tremont"}
{"text":"Excellent Cajun food.  Spicy andouille sausage sandwich.  Good craft beer selection.  Nicely decorated.  Feel like you are in N'orlens."}
{"text":"First off, this restaurant looks AWESOME inside! The decor is art deco and there are real gas lights! It has a tin ceiling and glass chandeliers. The only thing that ruins the ambiance is the TVs - they don't belong in such a classy looking place. Anyway, about the food: I ordered the platter with gumbo, jambalaya, and ratatouille and my boyfriend got the shrimp po boy with hushpuppies. Everything tasted good, although the gumbo was a little bit too spicy for me. We got creme brulee for dessert and it was pretty delicious. As far as price goes, our bill was a little more than we would have liked, but not too expensive to prevent us from coming back (although next time we will order less). Drinks were a bit pricey in my opinion though. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Hear me out... I was raised in the heart of Cajun country (near Opelousas, LA) and I pride myself in knowing a good Cajun meal when I meet one... BSBR, sadly, wasn't one. What it was though, was a great \"fake southern\" restaurant that has endless flavor and impressive remakes of Cajun meals. So in all, if you're looking for a true Cajun meal then keep your expectations low... if you're looking for a good, flavorful meal that will leave you happy in a colorful and greatly decorated restaurant then here is your place!"}
{"text":"I ordered just about everything but the kitchen sink when I dropped by this uber cute barrel room. For a brief moment in time I felt as if I was transported to New Orleans but when several of the dishes arrived and lacked boat loads of flavor I knew for sure I was still in Cleveland. I would give 5 stars bc the server was spectacular he was ever so attentive and eager to explain the menu. Just thinking of the young man makes me smile bc he stands out & had such a memorable personality. I digress, let's get to the food!  1. Sweet Potato Fries- were finger licking good. The tangy yet creamy sauce accompanying the fries complimented the dish perfectly.  2. The Gumbo- arrived ice cold as if the dish had been prepared the day before and hadn't been microwaved long enough before arriving at our table. I sent the dish back and it came back transformed, piping hot and full of tongue teasing flavor.   3. The Nola BBQ Shrimp and Grits- was beautiful upon arrival but the fishy and rubbery flavor of the shrimp forced me to give the dish away to a friend after ditching the \"scrap the gross taste off my tongue\" shrimp. New Orleans is known for its seafood but they have taken a classic, no a sacred dish and ruined it by serving it alongside inedible shrimp. PLEASE SERVE FRESH SHRIMP so that someone does not end up getting sick.(I did not send this dish back)  4. The Ratatouille Vegan Royal- was the dish my vegetarian best friend ordered and boy was it packed full of flavor. I wish I would have purchased this instead of the Nola with meat of course!  5. The Spinach & Artichoke au Gratin- was savory due to the perfect balance of cheese to spinach and spinach to artichokes. The delightfully crisp layer of cheese on top made me close my eyes so that I could enjoy the burst of flavor teasing my tastebuds.   6. The Jambalaya- was nothing spectacular but it was artistically plated. Chief Gordon Ramsey would have been proud!  7. The Hush Puppies- were so good we had to order a second round. I felt like a child popping tasty little treats in my mouth!   In all I would love to give this place another chance, the menu is very impressive so I'd be more then happy to update my review upon my next visit!"}
{"text":"Go HERE for your next dining out experience! As a Buckeye living away, I tend to follow a lot of news about my old hometown. Lately, I have seen a lot of \"press\" devoted to raving reviews about BSBR. Since FOUR of us all decided that this place had promise (and this family rarely agrees quickly on where to eat), we figured it would be OK. OK? Oh, no, it is most excellent!  Two in our party have spent time in The Crescent City. They both said this place replicates authentic Cajun cooking. Son gave the Muffaletta two-thumbs-up. Hubby (and daughter) had the Crawfish Etouffee and made yummy noises the entire time. I had the BBQ Shrimp and Grits. \"BBQ\" is a misnomer, since this in no way resembles a sauce-drenched dish. Perhaps it refers to the heat of the dish - lots of it, but definitely not tongue-burning. All I remember was it was very good, and loaded with nice-sized shrimp. Loaded, I tell you!  I've told you how wonderful this place is. I told owner Justin Clemens how wonderful this place is when I had the pleasure of speaking with him and his associate Craig. Now YOU go to BSBR and find out for yourself how wonderful the food and atmosphere is. It's like C-town just got a little bayou on the North Coast."}
{"text":"Got seated at 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon with the restaurant only half full. Sat with girlfriend at a table for 15-20 minutes without anyone waiting on us. Finally, a server from another area asked if we were being wait on and we said no. She said she would take us but we figured we wouldn't get our food til midnight if we had stayed, so we walked out. We weren't seated in a dark corner, either, but right square in the middle on the main aisle. Hope the food isn't as bad as the service."}
{"text":"Great food! Very accommodating for large parties. This is probably the best creole food i have had outside of New Orleans!"}
{"text":"pretty solid. had amazingly fast service and the food was pretty good. it was not like life changing good, but it was satisfactorily tasty."}
{"text":"I LOVED my experience here.  When I walked in, I literally felt like I was walking into Old New Orleans; I mean, there are real working gas lights lining the walls throughout the restaurant.  The Happy Hour alone is reason to check this place out: Monday-Friday until 7pm and Saturday 12-6 - there aren't many places around that offer happy hours on the weekend and everything on the happy hour menu is $4.  The group I came with took full advantage of Happy Hour and we each ordered two things from it per person.  While the happy hour menu is limited to Gumbo, Jambalaya, Hush Puppies, and Sweet Potato Waffle Fries, ALL of these options are so so fantastic and delicious!  I tried everything and I loved it all!  The Gumbo is the best gumbo I've ever tasted:  it had so much flavor and had quite a little spicy kick that I really enjoyed.  I thought the Jambalaya, while good, was a little too sweet for my preference and probably wouldn't order again, but I don't like sweet at all so that's just me.  I was impressed with the flavor of the Hush Puppies because I often find the cornbread to be too sweet, but with the spicy aioli served with them, I didn't even think the cornbread was sweet at all and I would absolutely order these again.  The sweet potato waffle fries were insane, but all fries taste better in waffle shape in my opinion.  We also ordered a side of cheesy grits because everyone knows the grits are better in the south, and we figured being a restaurant based on New Orleans foodies that the grits would  be decent.  AND THEY WERE.  I definitely would like to come back and try out the rest of the menu here because it looks delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very authentic New Orleans dishes. The Frog Legs are amazing! Dinner can get pricey, best if you go for lunch and get a PO Boy"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, beautiful space.  We had frog legs, shrimp and grits, crawfish etouffee, the Voodoo Mama, Jean Lafitte and finished with beignets and cafe au lait. Everything was fanastic, although the crawfish was a little on the skimpy side and $9 for two little pair of frog legs is a bit steep. Otherwise, it was a great experience in a really nice space. Think New Orleans, but classic, not tacky."}
{"text":"My first time here, I had come just for drinks and an appetizer with friends. We sat at the bar. The lady that served us was very nice and knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. She had stories about the drinks which was a nice touch.  We all ordered different drinks and tried new things. I really enjoyed what I ordered. The shrimp we had for the appetizer was delicious. Highly recommend the green drink with the plastic crocodile on it. The only reason I did not give the fifth star is because I need to come back and try this place for dinner."}
{"text":"I was finally able to check this place out! I wasn't totally blown away but I would go back and I plan on going back. There's a lot on the menu I would like to try. I had to go with the jambalaya on my first visit. It was good! But beware, it is spicy! And I like spicy. The portions are pretty generous so the price is pretty fair."}
{"text":"This is a gem in Cleveland. It's a gorgeous place. The decor is beautiful. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The food is on another level. It is so good and flavorful! I recommend the Jambalaya and Gumbo. The drinks are fantastic! Such a cool place to hang out. Perfect for date night or just a night on the town with friends."}
{"text":"Best cajun food in Cleveland, OH. They have gator bites, seafood gumbo and much more!"}
{"text":"Only reason this place is getting 2 stars is that our waitress rocked and the drinks were good. The food.....not so good. Jean leffite is definitely frozen shrimp n catfish, shrimp poboy same fried shrimp as was on my entree, just slapped in a biggie roll. Ordered the jambalaya starter, rice undercooked, tiny portion, like four tablespoons, and one piece of andouille! Tasted like zattarans boxed rice....I've had it, I know! The ambiance is cool but I read some rave, 5 star reviews from yelpers in elite 15 so thought it would be amazing.....think their foodie cards should be revoked! Drinks were good, not much else to rave about."}
{"text":"Oh my! So good! Went on Friday and got the Mardi Gras pasta... Soooooooo delish! Was not expecting it to be as good as it is - yum!  Forgot to take a pic until half way through it : )   Also, the ambiance is quite beautiful and there seems to be a fun bar scene. The second floor overlooking the first floor is an ideal spot for a date."}
{"text":"Attended a birthday dinner and some of the meat eaters enjoyed their food a lot.  I on the other wasn't a fan of the vegetarian sides because they seemed to use a lot of vinegar in them.   On a better note though, they have a pear ale that is awesome. Also the atmosphere is great and they have a live band."}
{"text":"Meh, it was ok. We went for happy hour. Very limited drink and appetizer menu. The atmosphere was good. A nice place to bring a date, but it is a bit pricey, $15 fora po boy. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about. I would recommend this place based on location, service and atmosphere, but not for the food."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and so is the beer selection. Try the Jumbalya or the shrimp and catfish combo. If you want great service, this is your place!  Chef Johns sothern Lousianna style menu is second to none in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"A very unplanned visit but I am very happy that we stopped to eat here. Very busy inside but we were seated in 20 minutes which was less than what they quoted us in the beginning.  I just love the inside of this place and that they have two large bars!! Our service was not all that great but then it really wasn't horrible. Just didn't ask much of how everything was. But overall the food was amazing and I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"LOVED the food here!! It was authentic and delicious! I usually get the sampler which is worth the cost. The service was superb also. If you're looking for authentic New Orleans home away from home food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"When your happy hour starts during the lunch hour, it's hard *not* to be a fan.   I'd like to get the obvious, previously-stated things out of the way, which are:   - It's a gorgeous space. Like... really, really visually pleasing. I loved the dim lighting, accented by what I'm assuming were gas-powered lamps at each booth. Also, the high ceilings with decorative, metal ceiling tiles were gorgeous.   - The lunch service was phenomenal. Our waitress was adorable, talkative and knew the menu very well. My lunch date (my Dad) always has questions about wines, which tends to throw some servers off. She handled it like a champ and I appreciated her depth of knowledge of both the food and drink menus.   Now on to the other stuff--like food and drinks! My uncle lives in Louisiana--Baton Rouge to be exact. And I've spent a few vacations eating my way through NOLA and all the Cajun/Creole grub I could get my little fangs on. With that being said, I appreciated the authentic options, including muffulettas, po'boys, gumbo, and my personal favorite dish, jambalaya.   My dad scarfed down the muffuletta like there was no tomorrow, so I'm assuming he wasn't lying when he told me it was delicious. He also had a cup of the gumbo--same story there for Mr. Clean Plate Club. I tried the lunch portion of the jambalaya. It was served with more of a dry-spice technique, adorned with spicy sausage and pulled hunks of what tasted like smoked chicken. The dish was tasty, just not what I've come to expect from a slightly more tomato-based jambalaya. I will also add that while the dish was spicy, it did not pack heat. A perk for some, but not as much for a heat-hound like me. Overall the dish was just a little dry for me.   Price and serving sizes have me a little thrown, since my dad's meal was perfect. The price and portions were spot on. Did I mention they have a happy hour drink menu during lunch? Yes, please. But my dish was not as spot on. For the portion size I felt the $10 price tag was a bit hefty.  I'd definitely come back to try more of the menu items, especially for dinner and drinks. And I want to add that although I didn't love the jambalaya, to each their own! Don't let my opinion keep you from trying it."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places to frequent, but our last few visits have changed that. Perhaps they are under new management.  The service, while friendly, has always been glacial...probably, in part, because the staff is apparently allowed to use their cellphones, which tends to distract them...but, until now, the quality of the food made up for that.  During our last two visits, our orders were incomplete, and the last time one of our dishes was inedible.  I'm really disappointed, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went to school at LSU and lived in LA for 8 years. The first time I came here, I was certain it wouldn't be everything it was cracked up to be.   It's not going to be like New Orleans - so you have to accept that before you walk in.  However, the food was top notch. I'd recommend the gumbo, raw oysters, and frog legs. The hurricanes are great!   The ambiance is classy. A lot of places in NO can be dingy and dirty. So, this is a plus in my book! Great place for a date or for ladies night!"}
{"text":"What a gem! The ambiance is casual, but fun and interesting. A good spot for dates or families or group outings.  We had a great server, too. I brought my parents while they were in visiting and we were all super impressed with our food. My mother had the hurricane and was delighted by its sweetness.   Food: I got the crabcake sandwich (lotta crab, not very much cake and I was squealing with delight). The bun it comes on is soft and tasty, but bulky so I didn't eat much of it. The sweet potato fries are crunchy and delicious, though I didn't care much for the sauce they drizzle on. It's not bad - I just don't think the fries need it. My father got the French Market Andouille sausage po'boy. It's definitely got some kick, but he was over the moon. Most surprisingly, was my mother's Mardis Gras Pasta. I don't know why I had low expectations for a pasta dish, but I did. Alas, I was blown away by how good it was. The sauce is rich and tasty, but it's not heavy - I could have eaten the whole bowl after I finished my meal (I would've hated myself, but I wouldn't have gotten sick). For dessert, we got the bread pudding (very dense and SWEET) and the creme brulee (creamy and sweet. The berries really even it out.)  If I lived closer, I would be making this a regular stop. For now, I'll visit as often as I can!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat on the westside! Gorgeous atmosphere, amazing food, drinks and service.  However, some of the changes on the menu are not to my liking. Sad to learn on my trip in yesterday that they have made a few tweaks. Why add ham and chicken to the Mardi Gras pasta? It was perfect the way it was!  All and all, still on the top of my list and a great addition to Tremont."}
{"text":"We only stopped in here for drinks at the bar but this place was beautiful! Decor inside is elegant yet still casual with plenty of seating areas. Loved the layout with the inside balcony which made it feel like authentic New Orleans. We made it to happy hour just before it ended. My boyfriend tried a mini hurricane and I had a tito's, soda, lime- both $4! Drinks were strong enough and tasty. We didn't get to try any food but the options looked delicious (they have beignets!!). Will be back here to try the food!"}
{"text":"There were some definite highs and a few lows, but overall you can get a tasty meal here. The staff are very attentive, quick, and friendly, though our waitress failed to tell us the specials. We tried the andouille sausage po boy, and as the pick 3, crispy shrimp, greens, and jambalaya. Really really loved the crispy shrimp, battered crispy with what I would expect to be on a hush puppy, with a light creamy sauce. The greens were WAY too vinegary, but were tender and a good portion size. Would love some spice on them as well! Lastly, the jambalaya was tasty, but more like a dirty rice than a typical jambalaya, the sausage and chicken bits were tiny and few/far between. As far as drinks, there were a good number of choices, they were generous on the booze in the House Hurricane, but light on the fruit. My preference is for a bit more sweet, but will not complain about extra booze!  For the price, the pick 3 for $15 seemed just a tad small, I was hungry afterwards, but the waitress stopped by too quick to ask about dessert, so by the time I made up my mind (just a few minutes), she had already brought the check!  Lastly, I love the atmosphere, though I was afraid of dropping things over the balcony from our table! The music was a weird mix of 90s and 2000s, more of a Bourbon Street theme would have been fun!  Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant, and would definitely return, though with different expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped in for food and drinks on a Monday which is $3 daft night.  They have 30 different beers on daft, many of them are a steal for $3.  We started with the waffle fries which were good.  I got the veggie wrap and hush puppies, my spouse got the shrimp and grits.  My wrap was good, I loved the hush puppies.  The shrimp in the grits were on the small size.  For $17 I would think they would have some decent sized shrimp.  Overall we had a good experience and would give them another chance."}
{"text":"BSBR offers a fun and vibrant space with solid beer offerings and a New Orleans-inspired cocktail menu.  Unfortunately, the food seemed pretty flat and far from capturing the spirit of Creole and Cajun cuisine.    Case in point:  I expected the Cajun Jambalaya to really stand out with a mix of spices and some seafood thrown in to give it a diversity of flavor.  Instead, ordering a cup of the jambalaya as an appetizer, what I got was a pretty bland concoction with plenty of dirty rice (with a consistency that seemed a bit too thick) and only a few strands of chicken and barely noticeable bits of Andouille sausage.  And while on some level I can understand the least common denominator approach of excluding seafood (where people can be allergic or averse to eating shellfish), the resulting dish really lacks any soul.  The waiter did offer to add seafood of our choosing, but we didn't realize that all that meant was to provide us with a little cup of small shrimp and (for me) some crawfish (still in their shells) on the side.  I would strongly encourage folks to pass on this dish.  By no means stellar in its own right, you could probably do better with the jambalaya at the House of Blues.  On the slightly brighter side, the beignets were fairly received--you can't go too wrong with hot dough and powdered sugar.  I was surprised, though, how flat and lacking in fluffiness BSBR's beignets were.  You won't confuse these for Cafe du Monde, and while not exactly the same, you'll get a better experience locally with the doughnut holes at Red the Steakhouse."}
{"text":"What a gem! The ambiance was very New Orleans/Speakeasy type feel. Drinks were creative and on point. The bartenders were incredibly friendly and engaging. At first I did not want to walk in, but I am so happy I did... I'll be back to try some of their food menu."}
{"text":"OVERVIEW: Considering I've done a lot of dining in New Orleans,  I can definitely say that the cuisine here is equivalent to, if not better than, the majority of the places I've been. The ambience makes you feel as if you're in a classy place in the French quarter, with gas lamps, balconies, and Fluers de Lis on the walls. DRINKS: The draft beer list is extensive, offering unique selections... don't pass up Abita's, an excellent Louisiana beer that comes in multiple flavors (Pecan was my favorite). And of course you should try an authentic Hurricane, too. FOOD: Many New Orleans favorites to choose from. Hush puppies were THE BEST I've ever had. The jambalaya was also really fantastic and the Crispy Poullet po' boy was tasty.  TO SUM IT UP: Attention to detail makes this place stand out. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to others, whether they've been to New Orleans before or this will be their first \"trip.\""}
{"text":"Having visited NOLA three times and loving it, I was not sure that this would be a restaurant that would live up to my expectation.  Our group of four was delighted from the moment we entered the building and that carried through from appetizers to entrees and dessert. We each ordered something different and enjoyed our dining experience. I didn't notice anything \"blackened\" on the menu which was to my liking. I will recommend this establishment to all of our friends. Two things I would suggest is changing the slaw as I found this not good and improve upon the beignets as they were heavy and dense, but the Red Velvet Torte was delicious.  Cameron, our server was so accommodating and when asked he gave us a tour of the second level which was beautiful. Most definitely will be back..soon."}
{"text":"It has a great ambiance. The decor is really cool. The beer was delicious. I had the \"hot rocks\" appetizer. It's just fried shrimp with hot sauce drizzled on it. That was tasty. I had the Trenton salad. The salad itself was really wonderful, very bold flavors. I made the mistake of getting fried oysters on it. Dear lord did those fried oysters taste horrible. I can't get the taste out of my mouth. I also tried the beignets. They were tough and really chewy. I wouldnt recommend those."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! Great apps, great drinks, and the entrées are awesome too! It's such a great atmosphere, right out of New Orleans!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had a hurricane to start. Catfish and shrimp to start. Finishing with amazing deserts to finish.  The service was outstanding and the food exceptionally good our server was excellent and dry knowledgeable.  He is an asset to this establishment.  Parking is a little tough.   We will come back.  I believe our employees will love this place.  We will be bringing them here soon."}
{"text":"Very good tap list, wide range of styles, good selection for everyone. Tried the Andouille sausage app, really tasty, just the right kick of spice. Id come back here for a taste of New Orleans. Our bartender was really nice, sweet girl named Roz."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my family.   Service: Good. Nothing to write home about. Seated almost immediately. Server was pleasant.  Food: Presentation was great. Food was okay; everything was super salty.  My family and I got the 3 apps for $15 (gumbo, hot rocks, and sweet potato waffle fries), crawfish étouffée, and the shrimp creole. First, I wish they didn't drizzle sauce on 2 of 3 of the appetizers. I found the sauce to be heavy and they were heavy handed with it too. It would've been better if the sauce was given on the side. The two entrees were decently flavored. The étouffée was salty as hell and the creole was citrusy as hell.  I guess the main point that you can get from my review is that this place will give you your daily sodium intake in one sitting.  Also, I wish they didn't leave the patio door open. While my family and I were dining, a lot of mayflies were buzzing around which was kind of gross."}
{"text":"I paid 17$ for a shrimp creole dish. The dish was a handful or rice with some regular red sauce and about 6 pieces of shrimp. This dish did not come with any sides and was not filling at all. What a total rip off. Portion sizes at this R estuary will not fill a man up im a little guy too only 180 lbs. nice scenery inside though but a rip off I could've easily made the dish my self"}
{"text":"This has been my friends' and my go to brunch spot for years and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I love the decor and atmosphere. Their Marie Laveau is a great alternative to a regular mimosa, but their flavored mimosas are great too. Their menu has a lot of different options, but personally I almost always get the French toast. It's delicious, but sometimes the portions are a little small for the price."}
{"text":"The ambience and atmosphere were great. I felt like I was in New Orleans! Two floors of nicely decorated bar and table seating made for a nice spacious feel. The food was good, not great however and for the price I paid I didn't seem to get a lot. I had a chicken dish but only got a few potatoes, some ratatouille and a moderate amount of chicken for 15.50. The cocktails were also very good, but started at $8. It was a little more than I expected. I would probably go back for drinks and appetizers only."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that a ton of people like this place. I however am not sold on it. It looks really cool when you just stand in there - chandeliers, and the second level is a wrap around that looks down on the first. But nowhere that you sit is comfortable. The booths are oddly squishy, and we are all average sized people. The tables downstairs are all really close to to other tables and not at all intimate.   The food was ok, they have a couple of options that are gluten free where you don't feel like you're missing anything. The drinks were small for the price but decent.  We have been here three times at the insistence of friends and never have I been very impressed."}
{"text":"Since my brother lives in New Orleans, I have rather high standards for Cajun and Creole food, so I have wanted to try BSBR for a while. Stopped in on a Po-Boy Tuesday at the beginning of Happy Hour, with not many people in the place.  First the ambiance is excellent, they have captured the feel of the Big Easy in the room design and decor; one of the more spectacular and welcoming restaurants in the area.  The background music was an appropriate mix of zydeco and New Orleans Jazz at a reasonable level.  Service was friendly and generally attentive, although I did notice that my sandwich sat in the service window for a little bit, also I had to ask for napkins and was never given silverware.  The menu is concise and well laid out, I choose the Shrimp Po-Boy which was half price on special.  The sandwich is nice sized, a good portion of crispy shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickles and remoulade on a long bun with a large portion of fries.  The pluses were the portion size, the tasty sauce and the pickle chips that added a nice touch of saltiness.  The minuses included the shrimp tasted a bit strong, too much sauce that overwhelmed everything else and the fries being cold.    Overall I like BSBR, it has a great ambiance and the food has all the elements to be really good, it seemed like there just wasn't enough attention to the small details that would have made everything really special.  I will probably give BSBR another try, just to get a better opinion."}
{"text":"Went with a group and we ordered numerous menu items. None of us were impressed by any of it."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Bourbon Street Barrel while visiting Cleveland for the weekend and we knew we wanted to grab a few drinks in the Tremont area.   We were seated upstairs which is a little more quiet and has a great view of the entire restaurant. They definitely nailed the New Orleans decor and atmosphere. We were greeted by a friendly waiter who had several suggestions for us on menu options. We opted to order a Shrimp Po Boy and the Crescent City Combo with Catfish and Shrimp. We also ordered a Light and Stormy and Old Fashioned to drink. The drinks were ok but nothing to write home about.   The food came out incredibly quickly. Overall both meals were pretty decent but average for the most part. They do a decent job with fried foods but the breading on the fish didn't have a ton of flavor. Their sauce was one of the best parts of the dish!  Worth checking out if you're in the mood for Cajun!"}
{"text":"Really had high expectations for this place. I am a fan of authentic Cajun Creole New Orleans cuisine and discovering there was a restaurant nearby, I was truly excited. I must preface this review by stating that I am extremely picky with very high standards. I was grateful that they offered happy hour appetizers. This allowed me to sample the food before ordering an entre. I started with the hush puppies and gumbo. For $4 each, this special offers great value, as the portion sizes were pretty decent. I really enjoyed the puppies. The seasoning was spot on and the dipping sauce was amazing. The gumbo was average and could have used a little more seasoning in the broth. The red beans and rice were overcooked. The rice and the beans were mushy. The seasoning was ok. Also, there was much to be desired re the freshness of the food. It tasted as though they were either frozen or had been sitting for a while before being served. My daughter had the shrimp and grits which she liked. They were just ok to me; but I am not a fan of shrimp and grits. Maybe they were just off that day. It happens. However, i will probably not return. I rate this restaurant average."}
{"text":"This place was so beautifully built, love the feel and look... The food is just \"ok\" though. I'd go back strictly based on how cool the restaurant looks.... Hopefully food gets a little better!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while passing through Cleveland. The atmosphere was great-the interior is clean and very cool, and our waitress was friendly. There was upbeat New Orleans jazz playing as we drank our beer and cider from the list of 30 drafts. We ate around 4:00 on a Sunday and there was no wait. We shared hush puppies and each ordered off of the classic creole menu. Both of us had huge plates that we couldn't finish and they were absolutely delicious. Our only reason for giving less than 5 stars is that my husbands chicken was warm- still cooked, but not hot. This probably could have been corrected, but we still loved how great it all was. We would go again!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with a friend and had a great time! The happy hour house cab is very drinkable and they have a pretty extensive happy hour beer selection. We got the appetizer sampler as it was the same as happy hour prices on a Wednesday, and got the gumbo, shrimp, and the paella. The food was fine, but not stellar. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and very French Quarter-inspired. Plus, it's two stories and you can look up! I loved the vibe and the wine!  The service was friendly and attentive. I would recommend for a quick happy hour bite--especially if you need a break from the typical bar scene!"}
{"text":"Nice place, a little expensive but they did offer a nice option to get three small items as your dinner. The drinks we're delicious and old school drinks which we appreciated not any of this in house drinks nonsense."}
{"text":"Initially excited for a fantastic happy hour offering, we stepped in and enjoyed the atmosphere before getting a table. After that, it sadly went downhill but I inquired about the level of spice in the gumbo and jambalaya dishes, and the server assured me they were spicy (turns out they weren't considered spicy to any of us at my table), so I instead ordered a pulled pork sandwich. We had all asked for waters but never got any and the beer and cider that we ordered tasted a bit flat. When my sandwich came, the woman threw it in front of me so that the plate smacked the table with a thud and then wobbled noisily--At first I thought it was an accident until she continued to serve the remaining guests in that fashion. The sandwich was gross-- maybe if I could've put bbq sauce on it or something, but we didn't see our server again until 30 minutes had gone by, so we just got the check and booked it out of there as fast as we could. Do not come here!"}
{"text":"The drinks are good, crocodile bites are surprisly delicious and the place is beautiful."}
{"text":"A cool joint, good food, strong drinks, and quality atmosphere. Nice addition to Tremont."}
{"text":"MONDAY $5 burger, $3 drafts. How can you beat it? Delicious 1/2 pound burger with cheese cooked perfectly, add fries $2.50. 30 draft selection, great friendly service, nice patio, it can't be beat. We will be back and try the New Orleans offerings which I'm sure are delish?"}
{"text":"The food at bourbon street is to die for. I love the seasonally prepared sirloin. I love the fact that it's different every time but always awesome! The drinks are also fantastic."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on my first trip to Cleveland. It's a beautiful space and really channels that NOLA vibe. The gumbo was amazing and the spinach artichoke dip was a great appetizer as well. I got the Voodoo Mama which was red beans, rice, and andouille. It has great flavor and was HUGE. The server highly recommended the pulled pork po' boy which was also good. Too bad I'm only visiting!"}
{"text":"Very unique drink menu, bringing back some of the oldies but goodies eg Old Fashion, Gin Fizz, etc. One of the best patios in CLE. The atmosphere is very much like Bourbon Street in NO. They have done a ton of aesthetic work to this place to get that Bourbon Street feel. Try the hush puppies and mint Julep. Food prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"authentic NOLA food, including the gumbo and beignets! excellent service as well. this is the perfect antidote to a stressful week!"}
{"text":"I've been to both excellent and really dumpy places by now. I was honestly very impressed with the Barrel Room. Everybody was polite and agreeable from the start. They happily accommodated a birthday cake I brought with me -  which they refrigerated and brought out right after dinner, complete with extra plates and forks. The checks were split by default for a large group, which, if you've ever been with a large group, you'll understand how easy it makes your life. The beer list is extensive, the drinks are quality, and the food instantly teleports you way down South. It was busy yet roomy on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is unique for Cleveland; the art on the walls, the architectural details such as gas lamps inside and in make for a cozy, authentic experience. I already can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I can't wait to go back. Shrimp and grits and ratatouille were excellent. I liked everything about this place. The decor, the service and most importantly, the food. We tried the Joy De Vie the Hot Rocks(crispy shrimp with spicy kind of drizzle), Red Beans and the Gumbo, all terrific. I got the Vieux Carre' Poulette(chicken), very moist, great flavor and now I am hooked the ratatouille that came with it. The real star of the show was the Shrimp and Grits, my wife got that, but I \"sampled\" quite a bit of it and almost pushed her out of the car on I 77 on the way home for her leftovers. Now counting the days till we go back."}
{"text":"Washed up. Also half the menu on here is non existent btw thought I'd tell you before you found out like I did upon arrival 45 min drive for nothing on my dads bday,  he was nice but was disappointed smh nothing creole or Cajun about it knock off to papadeaux Honestly never again!! Waste! I'm mad because I was looking forward to something home like and I've anticipated this for months it irked my soul."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 4 pm in a snow storm and nearly our whole party was late, but they generously accommodated us. The atmosphere is fun, very reminiscent of New Orleans. And our server was great: very attentive and had a lot of fun with our party.   They have a great happy hour (which ran until 6 pm on our Saturday visit) with $4 Abita drafts, mini hurricanes, Bulleit bourbon, appetizers and other great choices. We tried the hush puppies and waffle cut sweet potato fries and both were good.   I finished out my meal with Shrimp and grits, which was fabulous and brought me back to New Orleans. The portion was huge and could have been split with 2 people.  Others in my party opted for Jambalaya, Gumbo, Gator Bites, and Po Boys, which everyone was happy with. They even offer smaller \"appetizer portions\" of the Jambalaya and Gumbo, which was great for those who didn't want a whole meal.  We ended our visit with the bread pudding. Everyone was way too full for dessert, but we couldn't pass it up. The bread pudding itself was great. The bourbon sauce was more similar to a frosting, but the addition of fresh blueberries and strawberries was the perfect way to top it off.   Overall, the visit was great and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"My date wanted to stop here for a drink since it was 4pm and the other restaurant we chose wasn't open yet. The bar staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. Dark but not too dark, had a very warm feel to it. Service was so good we ended up staying to eat. We just split the pick three appetizer. Hush puppies, greens and jambalaya. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"A taste of the French District Gulf Coast in CLE!!!  This is one of the best meals the six of us have had in a long time.  Ironically, I dont really love cajun but I miss Mobile AL.  It is not just the food ( although the fresh crusty bread and my grits are worth a return in itself) it was the look, feel, and the staff.  Top notch 5-star feel with moderate and affordable pricing.  Ask for Siobhan (Shavonne) and she will take care of you with practical white glove service.  She gifted me a creme brulee for my Bday :)  We were all transported to the French District last night.  Thank you BSBR!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first experience here wasn't very good. However, Justin who is the owner asked us to come back for dinner on him. We accepted and this is my new review.  Bravo, everything from the hostess, to the kitchen staff was amazing. There were 5 of us. Our server was Curtis, he was seriously sunshine on a cloudy day. We loved everything about him. Justin made it up to our table to introduce himself which was very nice of him. Drinks were flowing, appetizers were hot and delicious.  Our main meals were fast and amazing. I'm not sure any of us came up for air. Coffee and dessert was spectacular. We'll definitely be back, we're thinking of making it a monthly girls night out. Thank you Justin and Curtis for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"The crispy oysters were great! But, the gumbo, crawfish etouffee and crawfish pasta was not Louisiana style."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for Cocktails.. Got to try the Hurricanes!! They are Fabulous !! Going back next week.. Very good service and nice atmosphere !! Hard to find parking but worth the worry!!"}
{"text":"OK.  That's all I can say about this place.  I was in town visiting family and I decided to give this place a try.   Service:  From the demeanor of the server, I would be surprised if this wasn't his first job waiting tables.  Very attentive, yes, but seemed to be flustered throughout the meal.  We had asked for suggestions on dry wine, but wasn't able to provide suggestions.  I was pleased, though, that they provided samples of the beer and wine until you find the one you like.  I ordered a beer, but was later informed they were out.  This should have been known at the time of ordering.  Overall, service was good, but could be cleaned up a bit.  Food:  Nothing stands out.  I had the Cajun Jambalaya, which was tasty.  We also tried the Po Boy, but thought it was too much bun.  Shared the hush puppies with the table.  Flavors are there, just was cold when it was served.     We had the beignets to finish the meal. Nothing special, but it was fried, so I'll have it again.    Atmosphere:  I can't believe this space actually existed in this area.  There is so much potential, but not sure what to change.  This may be picky, and I am surprised someone hasn't posted on this subject by now. The booths are too small.  Either someone took the wrong measurement, or they were trying to squeeze in a few more seats.    I think this place has a lot of potential.  It is a great building, in a trendy neighborhood.  I am not in the restaurant business, but I'm sure it takes 3-6 months to work out the kinks.    I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"What a beautiful cool atmosphere! From the kerosine lamps to the metal ceiling - they didn't miss a detail of New Orleans! Our waiter Anthony was perfect - he had a passion not only for food/bourbon but also for THIS restaurant. He had so many nice things to say about the owner and staff.   I ordered the SW Louisiana Cajun Jambalaya - it was delicious! Loved the rice chicken and andouille sausage (on the spicy side for sure!) combination! My friend got the New Orleans Shrimp Creole - very big portion but tasted a bit to fishy for me. I don't order seafood normally bc i won't like even the tiniest bit of fishy taste so I may not be a good judge! Haha!  The bourbon drink I ordered was a very small pour. That would be the only \"issue\" I could say. We will be back to this fun delicious establishment!"}
{"text":"Their bread pudding is amazing! It has a bourbon domaine on top and fresh berries. The husband and I shared that with Mitchell's vanilla ice cream.  Sooo good."}
{"text":"This place is lovely! Most recently I came here for brunch on a Sunday and was not disappointed. The interior is beautiful but it's the food that's a complete win.  For brunch I ordered NOLA BBQ Shrimp and Gritz with eggs. The flavor of the gritz was amazing, herby and complex without it being too much. Another plus is they didn't skimp out on the shrimp, very nice considering the many places that will do that very thing despite the word \"shimp\" being in the name of the dish. The eggs complimented the dish (done to your specified liking) and the baguette was a lovely addition. This is definitely my favorite thing that I've ever tried off of their menu, highly recommend.   My friend was in the mood for something sweeter so she ordered the BSBR French Toast and it was perfectly done. To combat the cold weather we both ordered the Cafe Au Lait and it was a perfect compliment to the food and the weather.  The service was quick and very friendly despite how busy the place was which is always a plus. Overall the atmosphere is both welcoming and vibrant, the perfect place to grab some food or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Being from Louisiana, I am a tough critic on Cajun and Creole food.  The Bourbon Street Barrel Room does it RIGHT! From the atmosphere to the service to the incredible menu, it is top notch! Chef Johnny Schulze is a true Louisiana native, so this guy knows how to cook some Louisiana food! Owner Justin Clemons nailed it when replicating the building of what you would be in if you were really on Bourbon Street or in the heart of New Orleans.  I can't even recommend one certain item on the menu because it is all so good (and I have honestly tried everything because I go so much). Whatever you do, make sure that you get dessert, especially the beignets or bread pudding! THE BEST! If you are looking for a good night out with good food and an impeccable atmosphere, this is your place! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Bourbon Street Barrel Room with friends for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed everything- from the atmosphere to the dessert! I would recommend that more people attend the Sunday brunch here because it is underrated! I came with a rather large group and we didn't make a reservation but were still seated right away so that was a huge plus. First, we ordered beignets for the table and we all loved them! They were so light and fluffy and my friends who have been to NOLA said they were true to the real deals down south. For my entree, I ordered The Esplanade omelet (vegetarian) and I thought it was very tasty. I especially liked that it came with goat cheese since. I believe goat cheese is the best boldly flavored cheese to compliment the neutral taste of eggs. The dish came with home friends and toast on the side and I enjoyed drenching them in the BSBR hot sauces!  A special plus about BSBR: if you are vegetarian and decide to come here for brunch, you can order any number of sides from the A La Carte menu and personalize your meat-free meal! Not many restaurants have such an extensive sides menu for this to be possible."}
{"text":"Transplanted person here - recently moved from Houston and very familiar with NOLA and her delicious food. The atmosphere here is wonderful and our server Ethan was great. Happy hour deals were solid. My only moment of disappointment came when my gumbo was delivered to my table. Ne'er a succulent round of andouille sausage was to be seen nor a familiar slimy and tender chunk of okra. There were a few bits of protein that were small in size and tasted like chicken. My only advice - bolster that gumbo and return its soul, then we'll be all good."}
{"text":"The staff here was so friendly. I'm not really into Cajun food but I had the chicken and it was great. Went with a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Was great! Again the service was 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give more than 5 stars. No, seriously, can we check that? I'll wait... ... ... ok, fine, ONLY 5 stars. We were looking for a place to eat for our weekend in town and the menu here looked phenomenal. We couldn't wait to eat here, and somehow it absolutely, completely exceeded our already high expectations. The hush puppies were heaven as an appetizer. Perfectly cooked, and the bistro sauce is fantastic. My wife got the French Market Andouille Po' Boy, and absolutely loved it. (She doesn't like slaw, so she asked for citrus slaw on side. I ate the slaw and it was to die for!) I wanted to try a few different things, so I got the Joi de Vie w/ Hot Rocks, Gumbo, and Crawfish Etouffee. Hot Rocks were delicious, the combination of the hot sauce and bistro sauce was delectable. The gumbo was fantastic, I love sopping it up with the bread, just wish I had more bread. And the Crawfish Etouffee might be one of the top 3 dishes I've ever had. The decor is amazing, the server Cameron was absolutely fantastic. Zero complaints. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A large group of friends and I stopped in the Bourbon after the taste of Tremont. They were quick to seat all 8 of us and get our beverages. Everyone in the group was satisfied. Our waiter was extremely kind! I wish I had his name so I could give him a personal shout out. I'll have to update if he's my server the next time I'm there. The Ceasar salad was very fresh and tasty. I got a side of blackened chicken to toss on the side. WOW! That had some flavor to it. I also got a shrimp cocktail. I was expecting more from it for the price but the shrimps were very large and noticeably fresh. All of this on top of what I could only assume was their busiest day of the year was impressive. I can't wait to return and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland and wanted to try something different. This hit the spot!  We shared hot legs (frog legs) for an appetizer because why not?  They were really fine -nothing icky about them at all, seeing as though they are frog legs... For dinner we had shrimp and grits and a BBQ sampler plate, both delicious. If we are ever in the area again we'd certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, drinks are amazing! The bartenders really know what their doing! I've been there twice already and am excited to come back again ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great food and cozy chill atmosphere. I shared the Bourbon Street Grill with my husband and we were both satisfied. Finished off with the bread pudding for dessert; really good but very sweet.  Eat here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the restaurant building itself was the best part about this place. The prices were way too high for the quality of food we were served. My friend got a bowl of jambalaya and the rice was over-cooked and cold while my bowl of shrimp creole was both hot and cold. For $13-$16 a plate I feel like we shouldn't have to return our dishes due to them being cold. On top of that the wait was ridiculously long while being offered no real explanation of why we were waiting. Our group of 4 will definitely not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go when I am in Cleveland and I was thrilled to discover nothing has changed this visit.  The service was fantastic from beginning to end.  The food was yummy as always.  Their gumbo and jambalaya is SO yummy.  The voodoo wrap is to die for.  Yum yum yum!  I would thoroughly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Big fan of upstairs in this place.  Awesome atmosphere and pretty reasonable prices.  Upstairs bar always has a seat and good people behind it.  Nice beer selection and a nice place to take in a bit different fare!"}
{"text":"Came in first time late Sunday night and requested a recommendation of a must-have; I was not disappointed. My shrimp Po Boy arrived. Lightly crispy shrimp, just the perfect amount of dressing- which reminded me of Bang Bang Shrimp (never a bad thing), and the bread oh so soft yet somehow remained immune to any form of becoming soggy. I was happy.   At $11.50 though, this Po Boy might just end up leaving you as a \"Po Boy\"...Sorry, please excuse the mediocre wordplay...Luckily, I'm not stingy when it comes to food. 3 stars because it was perfect and I had a great drink. Bring it down a few $$$ or throw in some sides and you got me hooked."}
{"text":"Can you say hush puppies!!  Loved them.  Being a vegetarian I was surprised to actually have some options available.  I suggest the mardi-gras pasta.  It was really tasty.  I also loved the ambiance.  They put some $$ into this renovation.  Been there twice and loved both times.  We actually were there when they had a cool jazz band trio.  Cleveland.....do yourself a favor and enjoy a great night out at this classy place."}
{"text":"We love everything about this restaurant!  The food, the drinks, the staff, the atmosphere...perfection! We have been there a few times, and had friends and family in last weekend for a CLE tour.  My husband and I had a very long list of fun places to see...and their favorite just happened to be Bourbon Street Barrel Room.  Zack was our waiter and he was wonderful!!!  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!!!! 27 bucks for 3 drinks that we could not even drink because they were that bad!!!!  we are not picky people at all, especially when it comes to drinks. These drinks were terrible. We offered polite feedback that the drinks were not right and the waiter replied with our bill.  Dude did not seem to care about our feed back at all. Bogus!"}
{"text":"Amazing! As someone who frequently visits New Orleans, BSBR does an excellent job of mimicking perfection. Our food came out incredibly fast and our waiter was courteous and explained the menu to friends who were not familiar with the creole menu. The portions are HUGE so there's no way you can walk away hungry. The happy hour was on point highlighting signature drinks and food. I will be back many, many times."}
{"text":"Until recently, I had never been to the Barrel Room. It was like a weird, dirty little secret that loomed over my head for so long.   I finally had a good reason to come when Yelp Elite Ashley B hosted her fundraiser for Laura's Home on the second floor. Full disclosure: we were on the second floor only. As a bar in Tremont, I found the Barrel Room particularly beautiful and spacious. A two floor, New Orleans style bar, smack on Professor Avenue? Yes, please! As Joyce H pointed out, the beautiful ornamental metals and lovely chandeliers make a really memorable audience. A lot of care and attention to detail has been immersed into this place!  Our servers were awesome and attentive. I had two cocktails: the pisco sour and their signature gimlet. I can't tell you how happy I was to see a pisco sour on the cocktail menu. So often, I can never find this drink in bars around town. Both drinks were perfect and expertly crafted. For dinner, everyone at my table had a different entree, and our forks were stealing bites left and right. I took a chance on the shrimp and grits-- again, a hard dish to pull off, in my opinion -- and they were surprisingly awesome. Loved the thick, buttery consistency of the grits and the generous amount of baby shrimps.  Can't wait to come back again soon during the day for an experience on the 1st floor!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new restaurants. Very good food (love the po'boys), an amazing beer list and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Love the look of the place inside with the balcony type of seating. Ceiling is awesome. Tons of beers on tap.  Didn't eat there so can't comment on the food. Clean bathrooms downstairs. Even one upstairs for those unable to take the stairs."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! The food is spot-on! Portions are perfect, and the flavors of New Orleans (or NOLA, if you're a local) are as if you're at Brennan's! The service is tops - the servers really know their dishes and beers."}
{"text":"In love with this gem in Tremont. I've never been to New Orleans sadly, but what I feel NOLA has to offer can definitely be found nestled in this restaurant.   My fiance and I met our realtor at BSBR on a Thursday. It was packed! We were able to get seated and helped right away. The happy hour special is admirable: Running from 4-7PM, with $4 apps, Abita drafts, wine, liquor and cocktail selections.   We ordered the gumbo, jambalaya, hush puppies and split a shrimp po'boy. Let me just go through and rate them individually...  Gumbo: Standard, but delicious! Jambalaya: My favorite appetizer hands down. So full of flavor.  Hush puppies: The dipping sauce really made them. Shrimp Po'Boy: Delicious and juicy.   Will I be back? Yes, and soon. The ambiance was fantastic (the architecture is a sight to see), the food was delicious, the service was superb and the location is everything."}
{"text":"Still 3 stars, but...kudos to the manager for reaching out to me after my last review to defend his restaurant/apologize for my experience. I'd definitely go back to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I felt transported as soon as I walked into this place. The food, the drinks, the ambiance--all spot on! I lived in New Orleans years ago, and I visit as often as I can. This is the next best thing. Great cajun food + phenomenal beer list = crazy good time."}
{"text":"Crab cake sandwich & shrimp po boy was amazing. Best I have had in the Midwest, actually made me feel as though I was back in the south. Serve was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim after a rough day at work with a friend mostly for some relaxing beers and conversation. Their Monday special is $3 drafts (there's 30 on tap hence the $30 for 3 slogan) and $6 burgers.   The inside of bourbon street barrel room is gorgeous. Two floors with an open center, southern charm, and beautiful twinkling chandeliers. If you're a lightweight like me taking advantage of the $3 drafts it's quite intimate and romantic.   Our server was pretty straight forward with no cutesy over the top annoying bull like most restaurants in the states which I really appreciated. Quick. Informative. Not over bearing.  Happy to answer questions. I'll take that over a fake laugh and someone calling me sweetie any day. Sorry. Pet peeve.   I paid a little extra to add bacon to my burger. Definitely worth it in my opinion because bacon is always worth it. I wish they had more topping offerings but it was still a pretty decent burger! I opted for the sweet potato waffle fries which seemed much better than the shoestring fry option. I don't really love Cajun / creole food so I know that I'm not really the best person to review this place, but the Monday night deal was pretty nice. I was impressed with the variety in draft selection so I would definitely come back to see what else they bring in."}
{"text":"NOLA comes to Cleveland baby!!!  Gumbo, jambalaya, entouffee, shrimp & grits, beignets...this place looks, tastes and smells like a restaurant in the French Quarter!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, and the atmosphere is great. The feel of New Orleans is authentic as well as the food. The food is top notch and really good. The place is laid back and friendly. They have good specials and priced really well!"}
{"text":"Being from the south, I loveeeeee me some Cajun food. I'm always really skeptical about eating Cajun food outside of the southern states, but I decided to give this place a try. I came in on a Thursday, so Hurricanes were $3 off. $5.95 Hurricanes? Not bad, not bad. I started off with some Gator Bites. I love alligator. The bites were okay. I've had better, but the Bistro Sauce was pretty good. For my entree, I got the Crawfish Étouffée. This is my staple entree at any Cajun restaurant, and it's how I gauge the place. If you eff up étouffée, you're not worthy on my list of creole yummy goodness. Anyways, the Crawfish Étouffée was good! The roux was good. Not too salty at all. I do wish it was a bit spicier, but I'm glad the taste in general wasn't overdone. I finished off my meal with the Bourbon Bread Pudding a la Mode. YUM! It was a bit too doused in bourbon glaze sauce, but it was yummy nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Lisa was an excellent waitress. We had a party of 9 all our orders were correct including the delicious drinks. I had the fried oyster for an app and they were AMAZING! I will be returning soon. Great way to celebrate FAT TUESDAY! Woooohooo"}
{"text":"The food taste amazing. The beer and drink menu definitely perfect for a good \"pinky out\" time.  If your looking for a bar with cheap drinks and good bar food this place is not it. If u wanna really want the Louisiana, French quarter, bourbon street feel. This place is perfect. Great service and good music. I will be revisiting soon."}
{"text":"The ambiance is seriously on point. We sat upstairs and loved the vibe of the place, with the candles and the NOLA feel. Mira was our server and she was outstanding!! We started with the hush puppies and they were amazing. I had the chicken wrap which was so flavorful and well done. It came with sweet potato waffle fries which rocked. Our meal was under 40 bucks, for 2 entrees, some beer, and an app. Not a bad deal!!! Will definitely be back to try more. Such a cool CLE spot! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at BSBR. This time was brunch! It was my friends birthday the day before so I took her here. The staff was awesome as ususal. We sat at the bar. The girls were great. The only thing that would be nice is if they carried ranch. My friend got a wrap and asked for ranch and the girl said we don't have that. Did that deter her from wanting to go again, no. But it should be available for those that order an item. Steak and eggs for me. Steak was amazing and tender. I usually use A1 sauce but the spices were plenty for me. Her wrap was gone in 5 minutes, so needless to say she enjoyed it. Hush puppies were great as usual. The egg was made perfect and not boogery. Yes, I said that!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time here. It was amazing! Our waiter (I think his name was Chris) was absolutely wonderful. It was my boyfriend's birthday and he got us an order of beignets and even had a candle for him to blow out. We were both so touched and surprised! The atmosphere/decor reminded us of New Orleans. We felt like we were there again.   We got there about 6pm and happy hour was still going on til 7. They had $2 off ALL starters and drafts. The andouille sausage is to die for! And their beignets tasted just like the ones we had in NOLA. I also highly recommend the charbroiled oysters! Large draft beer selections, wines, etc. They also have great daily specials. The food came out quick with perfect timing. We had 1 starter and finished and the 2nd starter came out. Then after we finished our entrees came out! Finished our I give this place 5 stars and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"While most people think of this as a lunch/dinner place, I'm here to tell you they also have a killer weekend brunch. I wake up on Sundays craving the Esplanade (an omelette with goat cheese and seasonal vegetables), their Cajun home fries, and delicious French toast (I don't usually do sweets, but it's worth the splurge here!) The staff is attentive and they usually get you in & out pretty quickly even if it looks busy."}
{"text":"I dig this place. Ordered the alligator bites appetizer, gumbo entrée, and the barbecue shrimp and grits entrée. All three dishes were delicious, I especially like the shrimp and grits. The grits were sooooo gooood. I have never cared for grits until now!  It was so easy to park even though it was off street. Someone even came out and held a nearby parking space for us, so nice!! The inside was very spacious and I did feel like I was in an environment that you would find in New Orleans. And the lighting was gorgeous! Our server was so nice too. We came in around 3:30 and she told us of the specials starting at 4. We told her we were interested in the special, so she came back to or table at exactly 4 so we could get the deal. Great service!"}
{"text":"As your business neighbor in Tremont I have to say this is by far my favorite restaurant! The staff is always friendly and very a accommodating. The food is phenomenal! Being a vegetarian eating the same thing from other places, coming here is such a joy, the variety of entrées is amazing! On a side note, on a Thursday night in February, the dinner party for my birthday kept getting larger as more people arrived than I anticipated. The staff handled it flawlessly, everyone was happy...the food was amazing and it was a birthday to remember. Thank you BSBR for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"We have had both dinner and lunch here.  It was amazing both times.  Must taste the bumped up Bloody Mary!  And the Fried Oyster Po Boys are incredible.  We loved our lunch server, Danny!  The perfect waiter, friendly with out being too much!  Recommend this for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here after an event downtown on Saturday. They have an all day happy hour which was nice. I was disappointed when the Bourbon place only had 1 type of Bourbon on the happy hour menu but i was enjoying the titos this day so i wasn't too bothered. The food was standard, the service was excellent. The bathrooms are  a bit out of the way as you have to go downstairs, but they were clean as well for being a bar. When in tremont looking for a weekend happy hour we may be back, other then that not sure."}
{"text":"Love the space. Service was great. Dry jambalaya is in need of a lighter hand for the cumin; so overpowering it's all you can taste. Why change a dish that didn't need it? Go back to the dishes roots, chef. A good tomato base version will bring customers back again and again. The shrimp creole was good, the beignets not up to par. I'll wait for change before returning."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch. I got the crescent city omelet based on the waitress recommendation. She said the sausage was locally made and had a smoky and spicy flavor. So two of us got it. We actually found it lacked in the flavor. The egg tasted over cooked. My husband got the French toast and enjoyed it.   They were spot on with the mimosas. Pomegranates and orange were delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Nicely done. Server Isaac was great. Had the shrimp po' boy. Huge amount of lightly battered and fried shrimp. Could have used some more dressing and toppings as that's where the taste is in the sandy. Hush puppy's were solid. If all the po boys are as big and tasty as mine was this place is gonna do well."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is awesome. It's a very trendy restaurant and perfect for a date night or a happy hour. If you're planning on eating, you better like creole food. Your options will feel very limited otherwise. I'm not a fan of the Louisiana style cuisine, so I opted to visit on a day when I knew their burger was on special, Monday.   For a Monday night, the place was pretty full with people either having dinner at the tables or drinks at the bar.  It's $3 drafts ALL DAY which is about half of normal price.  That in itself made it worthwhile and has cemented Monday as my favorite day here. They have 30 different beer options and some pretty interesting beers I hadn't tried before. I fell in love with an apricot beer they had on tap and I'll be back again soon to try to get some more.   The food was average as far as I'm concerned. They offered it for $6 on a Monday and it will be a few bucks more if you want the side of fries, hush puppies, or sweet potato waffle fries. It felt like there was a very small portion of fries for the side and I'm a boy who can eat. Overall, the daily deal ended up saving $4 off the regular menu price.   The servers were nice and to the point. We had two servers because one was training and they were punctual but not overwhelming. They left us to our drinks and came around whenever they saw we were getting low, just as an expert server should in my mind."}
{"text":"Beautiful, fun restaurant. Just like being in NOLA. Fun drink menu and food menu covers all the bases! Hot rocks delicious and were recommended by a local. Both dinners were great also. Super friendly, informative staff. Will be back when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  Yes it's beautiful on the top level & the Jambalaya was good & full of heat but nothing jumped out at me that really grabbed the feel of the famed city.  The Beignets were stale & cold, not fluffy hot pillows, creme brulee lacked in flavor.  Wanted to really love this place.  Service was awful & forgetful, not informative the 1st or the 2nd try we gave them.  Really, the 2 stars were for the Jambalaya & lacked the portion expected.  If you're going to go for a New Orleans cuisine here in Cleveland, it better be great enough to make you want to go because you can just imagine how even more amazing it would be there!  It's all about food & culture, honestly I can make a better Jambalaya at home.  Really wanted to love it here!  So disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not a fan of the Gumbo, my family is from Nola... everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"My parents and I have been going here since it open. This place is absolutely excellent with such a great atmosphere. They have valet parking in front which i highly suggest because there is no parking other than street parking.   In terms of food, its absolutely delicious, especially the desserts. The only downfall is they rarely change up their menu so if you stick to one thing you like and that's it, then this is the place for you.   If you want a fun atmosphere in a unique location with excellent food, you have found your place!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, the atmosphere is darling too. I'm a fan. I had a trio of red beans and rice, jambalaya and gumbo. All were incredibly authentic full of flavor. I also had a flight of beers and went with all Abita's they had on tap. This is a great feature so you can sample things before you buy a beer you wouldn't drink. Kid's meals were beyond what you typically find on a kids menu. They ate it up plus they got a beignet for after dinner treat that is included with all kid's meals. Great place."}
{"text":"Wow where did I miss the boat on the glorious yelp reviews.  My friend I both ordered the \"Joi De Vie, try 3\" special and we shared our 6 varied foods. Sadly We only liked 2 of the 5( we both ordered crispy shrimp) The shrimp was good, so were the hush puppies. Everything else was a Disappointment including the ratatouille, chicken and andouille sausage gumbo, and Jambalaya. My friend is from the south and her opinion of the food was that it was not good. As for atmosphere and ambience very cool vibe, very NOLA feel. I would go back again, but I'd order much differently."}
{"text":"Went to Bourbon Street Barrel Room to check out their happy hour. Awesome prices on drinks and starters. Bowl of gumbo was only $3.50 and was fantastic!  I used the CLEseats app and got 15% off my total bill. The menu is fun and the food was very authentic. Great location. I love the Tremont area in the summer."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I do enjoy it. I've been here for drinks, dessert, brunch, and now dinner.  I went here the other night with a friend for dinner. I want to start out by saying I've been to NOLA so obviously I'm going to compare it to that a little... of course it's not as good as the real thing but it's a very good attempt.  First the atmosphere is real cool. It does feel like you're in NOLA just based on the facility itself. My most recent visit I had a shrimp po boy which was pretty good but the shrimp really had that fishy taste to it you could tell it's definitely frozen. The bistro sauce on the sandwich is delicious!! I need that in a bottle lol as my side dish I ordered hush puppies which had good flavor but they were luke warm.... I like my food piping hot (it's just my personal preference). For dessert I shared beignets to be honest they are very good but are no where near Cafe Du Monde. The beer selection is actually pretty good, they had several different styles. I really enjoy this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this joint after reading some great Yelp reviews and noting a lack of good cajun/creole fare in CLE.  Let's start with aesthetics: this place is gorgeous.  I felt like I was stepping into a restaurant in the heart NOLA.  The front bay window opens to allow al fresco dining (a HUGE bonus with short summer months in OH).  They have a large outdoor patio that is spacious, yet cozy.  Food: hubby had the etouffee.  Large portion, mildly seasoned.  Son had the muffaletta w/ pomme frittes.  Hearty portions.  Kiddo loved it.  I had the shrimp and grits.  Huge portion, reasonably priced.  I wish it had that cajun flair I was craving....spicy, but it was lacking in spicy level and needed salt.  Grits were the savior of the dish.  I think there were about 4 shrimp total on the plate.  Finished the meal with obligatory beignets.  These were outstanding.  The fresh fruit topping really made them come to life.  Drink: excellent variety of beers on tap.  Try a flight for $10.  Great way to try a variety before committing for fairly cheap.    Service: Outstanding.  Can't say enough good things about our server, Danny.  Attentive and polite, even if slightly green, understood his customers' needs.  I would recommend this place without reservation.  Please just season the food so I get that cajun sensation."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant, but the food was just average. I loved the environment and they did have a nice happy hour going. We ordered the jambalaya and gumbo as appetizers and they were very very tasty! But they were better than our entrees. I had the shrimp creole. It was alright. There was not much spice, and it was overloaded with squished tomatoes. My friend had the shrimp and grits. She said it was good but there was some sort of pickled taste going on that didn't jive with the dish.  That being said, we do plan on trying this place again. Staff was very nice and very helpful."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! The food, the staff, the ambiance. Didn't know a hidden gem like this was in Cleveland, please give it a try. So worth it!!"}
{"text":"Not really sure of the place. Will I go back, maybe.  The atmosphere was awesome. 2 floors, 2 bars. Perfect.  Not being able to make a reservation, needs to change.  The pricing for the size, a bit too much.  The music, weird. Needs to be changed.  What did I like most, the hush puppies. The entree, mediocre. I felt like I was eating a bun with some chicken inside of it.  Server, she was friendly, but damn, the food took FOREVER.  The desert, not so great...at all."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of Cajun food but this place is exceptional. Went above and beyond to accommodate my 10+ person party at 11pm that included ppl with strict dietary restrictions. I wish their cheesecake was a little larger for the amount paid, otherwise everything was well above average. Definitely a destination in the heavily saturated tremont food scene."}
{"text":"Really cool concept!  Glad someone created something like this for Cleveland. The inside is very clean, decorated well, and the staff was amazing and very attentive. I only tried two food items- the crawfish which was pretty good (wasn't too hot and was already out of the shell for me which I was happy) and the pork and bbq Po Boy which was really good (no hot dogs in the Po Boys if you're expecting that). Overall it was good, the Gator Juice drink was good and had great visual appeal too. I'd definitely go back to try more food!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome combination of atmosphere, food, and service. My girlfriend and I stumbled upon it when visiting Tremont and would definitely go back. New Orleans style food within a beautiful interior design practically submerging you into Bourbon Street itself. I had the Gator Boy Po' Boy \"Poor Boy\" and it was out of this world. I strongly recommend getting it with sweet potato waffle fries. Be sure to come during happy hour for $4 Tito's drinks!"}
{"text":"Love the location, and how quickly we were seated (especially since it was St.Patricks Day night) and we weren't sure how busy it would be. I recommend the Mardi Gras pasta wth blackened chicken. My friend ordered it with shrimp but wanted it spicy so they brought her a side of some Cajun salsa but we think adding that ruined her pasta. Next time someone says they want some spice the waiter should recommend the blackened chicken because the chicken definitely had a kick to it that perfected the meal for the two of us that ordered it. My bro friend enjoyed his half BBQ chicken and my other friends sandwich (can't remember which one) looked delicious and she enjoyed it. Next time I go I'll be ordering something that comes with sweet potato fries since I didn't have any this time and I'm looking forward to it. I would have gave 5 stars but our waiter wasn't the best."}
{"text":"I ordered the Seasonal Veggie Omelette with goat cheese. It was somewhat bland but still filling. The home fries on the side were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, seasoned well. My husband got the seafood omelette and said that it was a bit heavy and while it wasn't something he might have again, he still enjoyed the experience. After brunch we had beignets (for the first time ever) and they were quite good (though they were laced with powdered sugar). The ambience of the place is lovely and it is beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"So I yelped this place after arriving  in Cleveland on a business. My group and I decided to give it a shot. Upon arrival Your greeted with An authentic looking New Orleans style structure. The interior is definitely a nice vibe, perfect for a friendly gathering or an intimate date. Our waiter was attentive and handled our party of 9 without a problem. He ended up giving us the full run down of the menu and gave us suggestions. I ordered the Painkiller cocktail and it was nice and strong. The crab cake was amazing and obviously made with real crab meat. For my Entree the Shrimp and Frits was to die for. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Bourbon Street for lunch with my family and had a great experience. Food was the best it's been in the many times I have been here. They really seem to be hitting a good stride. Jambalaya was on the money and shrimp and grits were tender creamy and buttery. Atmosphere and the staff were great. Our server Jen was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday brunch while visiting the area....excellent meal, service & overall fantastic dining experience.  Staff is friendly & very welcoming.  Probably the best meal I've had in a long time. We had the zydeco steak n eggs,  debris po' boy & seafood omlet.  We'll definitely stop back again!"}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere!  Delicious frog legs! Unfortunately there was a bar tender on staff that needs some proper etiquette ! She greeted me and my friends with rude comments and a scowl on her face. Management did take care of things but she can F' off."}
{"text":"We went there tonight and had an amazing experience! Our food took 10-15 minutes to come out and it was hot fresh and steamy! The restaurant atmosphere was really wonderful! It out you in that Louisiana-ish feeling. I tried the Gator Juice which tasted like pineapple juice with a slight kick omg it caused me to fall in love. The food was flavorful and just a suggestion...if you like spice and heat then I would suggest trying the SW Louisiana Cajun Jumbalaya which was what I got. My boyfriend got the voodoo wrap and French fries which had a slight kick but still was bursting with flavor. The greens tasted like somebody cooked them with love . Overall the experience was an amazing one and we will be returning"}
{"text":"Bourbon Street Barrel Room is an absolutely fantastic establishment - living true to the popular New Orleans phrase 'Laissez les bon temps roulez'.   Good times roll, indeed, at this joint.          From the outside, you get a good idea of the kind of restaurant this is with old-style gas lamps hanging, that also hang near every downstairs booth as well. Very cool and wonderfully Southern. The ambience here is a big part of the fun, and really makes you feel as if you're in New Orleans - we absolutely loved it.  Though it was lunch and we didn't go upstairs, the second floor looks very cool as well.         Ordering was a hard time for me as everything, literally everything, sounded crazy delicious.  I ended up with the Catfish Po Boy and hush puppies, and my god, were those hushpuppies good.  So. Delicious.  My catfish sandwich was amazing too, nicely accentuated by a drizzle of bistro sauce as well as some of the chef's homemade hot sauce (a must try).  Seriously, so good.  My fiancé also loved her dish, the Voodoo Mama, which was a classic (but wonderfully flavorful) red beans, greens, and brown rice dish.        Their drink selection is a very nice too, lots of craft beers and cool sounding cocktails - even one named after the coolest X-Men member himself, New Orleans native Gambit.  The Ragin' Cajun himself would really dig this joint.      We've already decided that this is our new favorite joint in CLE, and we will be back asap.  Flavorful food, quick service, good drinks, and amazing ambience can all be found at Bourbon Street Barrel Room."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant for the first time on a Saturday night.  We were early and the place wasn't very busy.  The interior is beautiful and we loved the theme. We decided to eat on the patio. We loved the individual heating above the table because it was a little chilly out. The server was friendly and our drinks came out quick. I ordered the Hot Rocks Shrimp and oysters on the half shell. Both were really good. Everything else was horrible. We ordered the Jambalaya and the Ratatouille. The jambalaya was cold with almost no veggies, and no chicken. The rice was dry and the food had no flavor besides the hot sauce. The ratatouille was disappointing as well. It looked like it was cooked a week ago. It was over cooked to boot.  I don't know if I would go back!"}
{"text":"If I could give Bourbon Street Barrel Room 0 stars, I definitely would. I can't comment on the food because after we were seated on the patio on Saturday evening (and it wasn't busy), we were completely ignored. A couple was seated behind us about 5 minutes after were seated, and less than 10 minutes later, they had drinks and appetizers while no one had even stopped by to get our drink order. There were two servers covering the patio, but apparently neither of them noticed that we still had menus in front of us and no drinks. After about 15-20 minutes of waiting, we just walked out of the restaurant. I highly doubt that anyone even noticed we weren't there since we had never been acknowledged by anyone other than the hostess who sat us.  Very disappointing experience and I don't plan to come back. I could understand a wait time if the restaurant had been packed, but that wasn't the case. Inside was practically dead, and there were open tables on the patio with TWO servers working. We were hungry, and going elsewhere proved to be a much better decision."}
{"text":"The place is decorated perfect theme wise. Drink specials and variety of drinks are good. Food in my opinion was average. I prefer JB Gumbo for cajun food to here. But I do enjoy the scenery here. In the restaurants defense my friend I went with really liked the food. To each is own. I would return to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Let me start off with the fact that the service here is 5 stars! The hostess promptly greeted us and we requested to sit at the bar which she advised was full service. Our bartenders were both friendly and attentive. For appetizers we had the andouille, crispy oysters and the artichoke and spinach au gratin. All very tasty! We each had a few different cocktails off the speciality menu which were delicious. For dessert we had the bread pudding, chocolate cheesecake and beignets. Again all delectable! Now, to the point of why this restaurant only gets 3 stars. Our dinners were awful. The bourbon street mixed grill had the driest chicken we've ever seen. (And I'm a terrible cook) It wouldn't be worth $9.95 let alone $25. The only thing good on the plate was the sausage which from the menu states it is locally made. Kudos to the sausage maker. Johnny's \"famous\" gumbo could only be famous for being the only gumbo to be made with literally no flavor. Someone actually compared it to \"Dinty Moore\" which I had no clue what it was until I googled it. All and all, great place for drinks and apps but pick somewhere else for your meal."}
{"text":"New Orleans food in Cleveland. Interesting.  Being rather curious about this new addition to the Cleveland neighborhood, and both being a fan of New Orleans and Cajun food, we went out on a chilly night to try this place.  It's a rather large restaurant- we walked in on a Friday night at 7pm and was seated within 15 minutes. Lots of different and interesting drinks on their menu- if you're a microbrew fan, you'll be pretty impressed.  Having a good friend in college who was from New Orleans and worked on a shrimp boat and having frequented the city before, I was used to this style of food. I was pretty impressed on how close to New Orleans the menu was- with the crawfish etouffee and po boys to red beans and rice. I went to the standard- the jambalaya. It was good- definitely on the spicier side, but the sausage was good, the rice was good, just overall it was a good dish. He got the andouille sausage po boy- it was also very good- we LOVED the bun. We also ordered a side of hush puppies which had just the right amount of deep fried-ness- also a plus.  Now, the prices are definitely not what you would normally see in New Orleans (definitely more pricier), but overall, I thought it was a good meal. I only wish they were open for breakfast (I saw beignets and chicory coffee....oh how that would be so good!!!!)...."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The drinks and food are fantastic! This place has the best gin fizz in Cleveland and I love the shrimp and grits!!! They also have an amazing brunch and happy hour as well. Bourbon Street is also very spacious and the wait for a table is rarely long. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and an amazing server. Shiobhan was very friendly and knew when we needed something before we did."}
{"text":"Service is great and the atmosphere is inviting, but.. The menu leaves much to desire. I tried to BBQ Poboy which was 75% bread with a sliver of pulled pork and a bunch of cabbage. The pulled pork tasted good enough, but the bread was stale and the cabbage seemed out of place and needed more company.   For dessert I shared the bread pudding. Presentation was horrible, but it was very delicious.   Let me also add that I am NOT a fan of Cajun food(not even sure if this fits into the Cajun category.. But whatever)... But I am not a picky eater. Good is good and bad is bad. I looked over the menu and just settled.. Nothing seemed like a great original idea to me, but I don't find that to be the problem with this place. It just seems like they cut too many corners with the quality of ingredients in the kitchen. Just fix that and I could see this being a new staple in tremont.   Great service and atmosphere goes a long way.... But if the food stays the way it is.. I can't see it staying around long."}
{"text":"It's my first time here based on yelp reviews! This place lives up to its rep. We ordered hurricanes, crispy shrimp, jambalaya, waffle fries, crispy chicken po'boy with hush puppies, and beignets. My husband says the jambalaya and shrimp were the highlight of our meal. I really liked everything. I would definitely recommend this place too. Thanks yelp for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"The only thing I have to comment about is the poor service. The food was great! I got the shrimp and grits (amazing! Didn't even know I liked grits) and my boyfriend got the gumbo which he really liked! Portions were large, and decently priced. We had the pick three app, the hush puppies were amazing and the red beans were great. The jambalaya was dry, and didn't taste fresh, but was still had potential. The only thing that didn't seem to have potential was our server Kelly. we each got a flight of beers (four 4oz beers for $10, great beer selection, do it!) and our server couldn't even tell us which beer was which. When asked, she responded \"you'll figure it out\". I asked for a menu recommendation and she didn't have one. When asked what a menu item was, she read me the description off of the menu. No personality, didn't greet us when we sat down, and acted like she didn't care about our table at all. As a server of 8 years, I am very forgiving of servers. It's a tough job some times, but all it takes is a good attitude to get a good tip from me. The decor, food, drinks, and atmosphere were great, I would recommend every thing other than our server!"}
{"text":"Came on a super busy Sat early evening, with tremont events going on. Although jam packed, the place was loud but efficient. When finally seated and ordered food.. Literally came out piping hot within ten minutes. Split the fried oyster Po boy and hush puppies with a friend-- out of this world! Both were so good, we ordered a second round of both. Washed it down with a spicy bloody.  Can't WAIT to come back and test out more of the menu. Awesome vibes here-- tremont gold mine!"}
{"text":"I saw the pretty photos posted and wanted to experience the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we were not there on a weekend and the upstairs was closed.  We were seated on the patio and our server was terrific.  My salmon dish was quite good, and my husband enjoyed his jambalaya.    The Tremont area looked cool and trendy, but we didn't spend any time after dinner."}
{"text":"One of the first places that I thought was amazing in Cleveland.   There was a wait, which sucks, but it was worth it......   I had the gumbo, which I have never tried and enjoyed it.   I love the decor and gator bites were well cooked.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's start this review by saying I had to wait a few days to write it because I needed to CALM THE HECK DOWN before I could find actual English words to write.  My bestie has been here before and mentioned a few times that I needed to check it out. It was on my list for a while, then finally another friend suggested it for double date night.  The 4 of us stopped in on the Saturday of Greek fest, expecting a mad house. We used the convenient valet, who attended to us immediately. When I walked in the door, I was instantly greeted by a smiling face and a gorgeous restaurant interior. I just love all the décor in the BSBR! I have never been to New Orleans, but it made me feel like planning a trip. Tin ceilings, 2 floors of dining, dark wood and lots of whimsical lighting. Every place my eye darted to was something exciting to look at.  We were nestled into a table in the back which was super dangerous- because we saw all of the food coming out of the kitchen. Hurricanes all around- the 4 of us devoured them. They were a perfect treat- fruity, well-balanced and a generous pour. Appetizers were a crab cake (YUM!) and my friends shared the Hot Legs. They were happy with them, but I did not try.  We were pretty quiet during dinner, and everyone agreed the food was amazing. I ordered Shrimp and Grits and I can't say enough about how delicious and perfectly prepared this was! It was hearty yet creamy, with lots of garlic and butter flavor. Served with crusty bread which allowed me to soak up all the goodness. This was such an amazing meal that although I'd like to try some other menu items.... I must have this again. And Again.  This was not a cheap eats kind of place, but I was satisfied with the price we paid for the value of the food. Our bill (with 2 hurricanes, appetizer, Shrimp and Grits, and Jambalaya) was around $63.  To me, it is well worth paying for good meal that comes with a great experience. Our server was a delight. My only regret is that I saved no room for dessert. Beignets were calling...."}
{"text":"It's been quite a few years since I last visited New Orleans, but the experience certainly rang true to what I remembered.   We went for Sunday brunch and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The Jambalaya was perfectly seasoned and the greens were a great complement. The beignets after the meal were fresh, hot, and positively decadent.  Service was much faster than I would have expected as well, in spite of the fact that the restaurant was busy due to a holiday."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and served quickly. Our server was very friendly and on top of things!"}
{"text":"Good food. Stick with the apps and po boy's otherwise a ton of rice. Forget the shrimp app, think popcorn shrimp heavily breaded with a Tabasco sauce. I thought they would be more on the lines of the size of your finger or bigger. Nope. Very clean. Did not feel like Tremont. I guess I'm used to a cool hip place that is still a bit of urban. This place could have been in downtown Disney. Very corprate feeling."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere. I have been here for lunch and dinner and stopped in once for just dessert.  They were really crowded, but, they accommodated us and brought us coffee and dessert in the waiting area.  Great staff too!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing!! The red velvet tort is the best dessert and their sausage was excellent! Isaac is one hell of a waiter and served our large party well. Their specials are great my friends said the shrimp and grits was excellent! Good wine and drink selection"}
{"text":"Each time I want to try another restaurant for some New Orleans type food, I can't bring myself to part with Bourbon Street.  First of all, read the menu ahead of time. Make sure this is your type of cuisine. The menu is extensive and offers a lot of variety, but definitely has certain flavors that you should be ready for. If you find something you might enjoy, don't hesitate and go.   We've worked through most of the menu spending one time even just getting appetizers to try all of the different flavors. Some favorites are the frog legs and gator bites which have some awesome sauce combinations. I personally have never had a bad dish here even when they are packed (which is most of the time really). The flavors are just what you would expect from jambalaya and gumbo. Even the ratatouille is a fan favorite with our group. You can really taste the heat and spices in each dish which is why we will be back again very soon.  Be patient with the service, there are two floors to this place and it's usually full. The food is worth it and the staff is always very nice, just trying to get to each table."}
{"text":"Food, beer, and service was good. If you like spicy this is the place to be. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a nod to the food I know from NOLA.   The place is pretty large so I have not had to wait either of the two times I have been here. They have a really nice large patio that surrounds the east and south sides of the restaurant. The front of the restaurant also has some stool window seating in front of windows that open up. The inside you can tell was carefully constructed - there are nods to NOLA style and design. The first thing that hits you are the gas lanterns. The ceiling and iron work caught my eye in close succession. The size of the space does take away slightly from it's coziness in my opinion, but the food more than makes up for that.   I have to recommend the appetizer sampler as either an appetizer or a meal ($15). If this is your first time here or if you have never tried some of these kinds of foods before I would definitely recommend getting the sampler. The sampler comes with three large bowls of whatever you choose. I find the portions to be large - large enough to split with someone or large enough, depending which choices you make, for a meal. I paired the sampler with a soup on one of my visits and was full! A lot of the food is rice based too which adds to filling you up quickly.   Of all the sampler choices I recommend the gumbo and the red beans and rice first and foremost. Next I would recommend the jambalaya and the ratatouille. The greens were also good.   Service is fast and friendly. Kitchen service is impressively fast as well. Tip: Try the mint julep drink."}
{"text":"Five stars for atmosphere, food, and incredible happy hour specials! This is one place in Tremont you definitely want to check out.  I came for lunch on a Saturday and we decided to sit on the patio since it was such a beautiful day. The patio is spacious and so cute. All the tables have umbrellas and there's a nice canopy of lights overhead. I could hang out here for hours! The inside of the restaurant was very thoughtfully decorated as well. You really get a flavor for New Orleans culture here with the ornate ceiling and sparkly chandeliers.   Our waiter was attentive and upbeat. Happy hour specials were phenomenal; there was so much to choose from, and prices were so affordable! We started with a round of Pimm's Cups which were very refreshing. We then ordered a bunch of different appetizers to share. The hush puppies were delicious and the sauce was to die for. The andouille sausage was great, and Johnny's Famous Gumbo was all I had hoped for and more! Spicy but not too spicy, and rich with flavor. I also had a Caesar salad on the side - not creole cuisine, obviously, but worth noting as it was quite delicious as well. We ended our meal with an order of beignets which came piping hot and fresh out of the fryer. Absolutely delicious.  I was so happy with my experience at The Bourbon Street Barrel Room and will definitely be back soon. Whether you like creole food or just a great happy hour, you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Friday night.  Missed an event due to traffic so decided to give bourbon a try.  I lived in Nawlins for a few years and am always excited for good Cajun food.  Place looks great. Decor is wonderful, especially the gas lamps and the balconies are a nice touch (even if they won't let you stand on there).  we had several cocktails all of which were well received.  The hurricanes were pretty typical.    I went with the sampler of jambalaya red beans and gumbo.  The gumbo was outstanding.  Very authentic.  Red beans were good but jot exceptional. The jambalaya tasted like it came out of a package.   Rice was very dry and the andoulie sausage bland.  That was disappointing.  Then came coffee and beignets.  Coffee was good.  Beignets.... not so much.     It's good fare.  Certainly better than  other Cleveland options in the Cajun category.   Pricing is decent and atmosphere is good.  Unfortunately my expectations were set high by. Cleveland.com article the put their food at the same level as l'Albatross.  It's not.   Worth checking out for what it is though."}
{"text":"New Orleans in Cleveland.  Drinks and food are very accurate to what you would get in New Orleans."}
{"text":"A MUST if you are anywhere near Tremont!  I spent three years living in the greater New Orleans area and BSBR is as authentic as it gets. Shrimp and grits tasted like I was back in the French quarter and the ambiance is spot-on NOLA. This is the place to go to for dinner or drinks or both. Either way, you'll want to make a night of it. The place is too cool to want to leave."}
{"text":"Really nice venue. Downstairs upstairs. Had some good brews. Waitress said to relax, take your time. Busy Walkabout Tremont night. Definitely a popular place. Friendly."}
{"text":"Such an awesome, unique place!! They have an incredible brunch menu and out of this world bloody Mary's with a southern flare. I've only been once but I definitely plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try BSBR! Friends and I chose it as our destination for an all-too-rare ladies' dinner on a recent weeknight. I arrived early and sat down at the bar to enjoy a cocktail and peruse the menu. I was charmed by the layout of the interior and looking forward to a lovely evening.  My cocktail experience basically summed up my impressions of the evening: the service was quite good and the drink was pleasing on the initial sip but was ultimately disappointing. I ordered the Cucumber Gimlet and, though tasty, it was much, much too sweet. The final sip made me pucker! To use a fine gin such as Hendrick's and to drown out the flavor with so much sugar is baffling to me!  The remainder of the meal was much the same: well-intentioned, but falling short in execution. Between the three of us, we ordered the shrimp and grits, the jambalaya, and the gumbo. A full compliment of Creole specialties! All came out looking appetizing, but proved to be overly large portions of salty, heavy food. It tasted pleasing in the first few bites, but as it cooled I was put off by the increasingly heavy feeling it gave me. I had to pack up and take home over 2/3 of what was served and was unable to stomach it at home either and it went to waste, I regret.  In hopes of a satisfying ending to the meal we shared an order of the creme brûlée to finish. Once again, we were found an overly large, overly sweet, unpalatable pablum that we were not inclined to finish. One in the group declined to even try a second bite.   As much as I was looking forward to this meal and as much as I hate to give it such a low rating, my experience left me underwhelmed and I would not be inclined to return to BSBR nor to recommend it to others. A charming design scheme/menu concept and polite service, to me, do not compensate for inelegant dishes."}
{"text":"I really like their happy hour. Very good drinks at a reasonable price and the food as well. I really like this location because it's right across the street from the ice cream shop. It's really great in the summer for a few drinks and food when you want something a little different with a great ambience."}
{"text":"First let me say I have had a life long love affair with the Big Easy and I'm totally in love with this place! I tried it when they first opened and I could tell it was too early to judge the food, staff and service. It's a big gorgeous place offering a cuisine here-to-for unseen in these parts. Everyone needed time to adjust to the new place. Well, this is my eighth or ninth time here and I am very pleased to report that all of the opening jitters have been calmed. The BSBR is swinging along to a great jazz beat! The tempo is upscale, the food is delicious and the staff, particularly the bar tenders, are fantastic! Happy hour is the best deal in town, with both food and drink specials at a great price. Now before you go saying, \"This guy must be the owner's best friend\", I swear to you we've never even met. I just come in, order my gin fizz and sit at the bar and watch the world go past. The owner and I have emailed each other many times with my suggestions and he emails back with solutions. This is a guy who cares about his customers and actually made changes based on my feedback. When does that ever happen!?! Give this place a try, it's one of the nicest locations on the north coast. Cheers! Back again and this time it's a new bartender. I thought, oh man, she's never going g to make my fizz the right way. I am happy to report that it was the best I've ever had! This place has truly found its stride!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor are excellent! I had the crispy gulf shrimp wrap and my friend had the creole shrimp. He said his food was really good. My wrap was good. I found out that I didn't really care for the taste of gulf shrimp, but that's personal preference and nothing against the way it was prepared.  Here's why I took off 2 stars. So a few tables down there was a service dog, and no the dog wasn't the problem. However, our waitress stopped by to pet the dog multiple times. I like to pet dogs too but not when I'm handling peoples food. Had she only did it once, I may have been able to convince myself that she had washed her hands afterward, but by the fourth pet down.... Besides that the service was good and we were able to be immediately seated on a Saturday night.  I take into account that was an isolated incident and would possibly go back to try their brunch menu"}
{"text":"Verdict: Would go again if I'm feeling NoLa or Cajun and want to casually hang out with friends for happy hour  The Food: ordered the tri-color Mardi gras pasta with sausages. I was warned that the sausages were very spicy and made of pork but if you can eat Korean spicy then you'll be fine. The dish was great and there's nothing I would change about it. Just the right amount of sauce, cheesiness, and meat. Got a happy hour order of waffle sweet potato fries ($5) too and they were standard.  The Extras: happy hour everyday! Check their website for more info. They're constantly changing their alcohol and have 2 pages of selections!"}
{"text":"They did an amazing job with this space both inside and out. You really feel like you are in New Orleans!  The food and drinks that we had were great, the service was as well. Can't wait to try other things here. Lots of creative drinks and the most amazing red velvet cake!  Also, surprisingly reasonable prices on both the food and drinks...!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out a few days ago.  Atmosphere is great! Love the upstairs and the decor. Really makes you feel like your in NOLA.  While the food wasn't super-duper and neither was the service, this would be a good place to hang out for a drink and snacks in a very cool bar."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. My children took me here last weekend for my birthday. This is the perfect place if you're looking for good, creole food. The hot legs were probably favorite dish. I tried one of their drinks from happy hour and didn't like it much-other than that it was a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Four of us went for lunch yesterday.  I have been wanting to get here and finally did.  Was a rainy day, but the voodoo gods of New Orleans must have liked us, it got sunny as we stepped out of our car so we were able to sit on the patio.  You know what they say about first impressions.....you literally feel like you have walked into New Orleans when you walk into the door.  Love the decor and authentic details.  Almost made me want to sit inside, but with Cleveland weather, I sit outside every chance I get.  Patio was charming as well, but not like the restaurant.  We were immediately approached and asked if we were here before.  The gumbo sounded good, but we asked server if it was spicy.  She offered to bring us each a \"shooter\" so we could decide for ourselves.  Nice touch, Shannon.  Two in the party ordered the gumbo, the other two thought it was too spicy for their tender tastebuds.  It was spicy, but oh so good.   In all, we got a shrimp po boy, crispy oysters, creole shrimp and the fleur debris po boy (chuck roast).  They were all very good, and the bistro sauce served with the oysters and shrimp po boy should be bottled and sold.  I can't finish my review without saying how great our server, Shannon was.  She engaged with us, gave us suggestions, took photos of us when asked and she made our experience that much more fun.  BSBR is a great addition to the Tremont neighborhood and wonder why it took me so long to enjoy this trendy, fun place with great eats."}
{"text":"I know everyone mentioned this, but I will reiterate - the restaurant is beautiful!! The second floor basically opens up in the middle as a balcony to the first- and in the open area, there are gorgeous chandeliers hanging down. The atmosphere is perfect and it truly takes you back to NOLA.   The service is great. I planned a work outing for 12 of my coworkers and myself and still called ahead to confirm that they didn't take reservations. The girl on the phone said they didn't but still asked how many and what time to make sure they had space available. They ended up being pretty empty that night, but the thought to accommodate was still appreciated. Our server was also great- we had people coming and going and different times and he did a good job coming back often to see what he could get for us (which was something new literally every time he came). Through the whole night, only one item was forgotten and when it was brought to his attention, he was extremely apologetic and made sure it was brought out right away.   The food and drinks are wonderful! I had the hush puppies (delicious) and the beignets (I think I was anticipating cafe du monde - so was a tad disappointed. However, they were still delicious). Everyone else tried a variety of menu items and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I ordered the Category 5 hurricane (or a few of them). The difference between category 5 and a regular hurricane is that the category 5 uses local rum, which is 100 proof. You can taste the difference, for sure. I definitely recommend the category 5.  They have different \"Specialty nights\" now on Sundays-Wednesdays, offering different deals each night starting at 4pm. We went on \"Mardi Gras Monday\" and our drinks and dinner entrees were all 2 dollars off! This was in addition to the happy hour until 7pm that offers drink and appetizer deals!   Overall, we had a great time and I can't wait to return. It was pouring the day we went, but I can't wait to check out the patio next time.  -- After 5pm, valet is only 6 dollars! They have a kids menu - feel free to bring little ones (we weren't sure since it wasn't online)"}
{"text":"Bourbon Street Barrel Room took great care of our 10+ party on my birthday this past Saturday. We really appreciated their patience with us (mainly me) upon our arrival on a busy weeknight and the service we received before, during, and after dinner was superb. Even with their space limitations, they worked to fit us into two side-by-side tables. Wait time wasn't too bad overall, and the atmosphere and food was fantastic -- especially my birthday beignets (aka warm, powdered sugar coated slices of heaven)!   Note for large groups: Call ahead. Be honest and patient with the hostess/staff. While they can't make promises on keeping multiple tables together, they will work to accommodate you to the best of their abilities. Try not to get frustrated. They really are doing their best.   A++ service. 4/5 stars because we were sort of shoved in the corner while we waited for a table. But we were out of the way, all together, and served before we even sat down."}
{"text":"Ugh I wanted to like this place- especially with how pretty it is inside. The food was HORRIBLE, cold, and had no flavor. We did come on a Wednesday night so the $5 beer flight was nice. The sweet potato fries with their sauce was a nice starter but the wrap and sandwich we got was pretty bad. Prob would check out something else before coming here again."}
{"text":"Fun vibe and atmosphere. Good presentation with the food but I just didn't think the food was that great."}
{"text":"What I ordered: Wyder's Reposado Pear Cider (AH-MAY-ZING) Crispy Oysters and Bistro Sauce (meh-okay) Fleur Debris (Chuck Roast) Po' Boy (nope nope and nope)--side order of fries or hush puppies extra ($2.50, which I think should have came with the po' boy).  Just left the place a little after 9:30 p.m. Friday (came in around 8:15ish). Music blasting, thought it was happening...nope, crowd was moderate (not a lot of people). \"Hostess\" was surrounded by a few other people but still managed to greet me.  Found a seat at the bar...don't remember my servers names (guy and girl, but I think the guy was new).  Service was okay and my food came out super fast. There was a small moment when I asked my male bartender/server no tomatoes on my po' boy, but got them anyway. But besides that, they were pretty attentive.  The vibe was pretty cool and laid back, not quite sure about a second visit though."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for absolutely ages and I finally had the chance! I am one of those people that fell in love with NOLA cuisine from the first time I tried it. There are few places up north that really replicate the same experience though, and I often find myself disappointed when I pick out po-boys or muffalettas on menus up here. Bourbon Street Barrel Room did a decent job of living up to my expectations. Is it exactly the same as NOLA food? No, of course not. But it scratches an itch for Cajun/Creole cuisine, and you can probably find most of the dishes you're looking for here on their menu. Their beer list is impressive, lots of Abita Brewery options to choose from, as well as other local options. They also have a great drink list, although I didn't try any on this trip. I ended up going for the shrimp po-boy. Again, it didn't live up to the higher echelon of NOLA po-boys, but the flavors and ingredients were right, and I wasn't disappointed.  As others have mentioned, the inside is beautiful, and it's a great place to take out of towners, or to impress a date. The prices are very reasonable, about $13-$15/ entree which includes a side. I would definitely come back here next time I have a craving for some New Orleans food, and I am looking forward to trying more things on their menu!"}
