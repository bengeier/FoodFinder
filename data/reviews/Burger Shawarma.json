{"text":"This is a clean place, unlike many shawarma places in Toronto. So I strongly recoomend here. Also chicken shawarma tastes great. And there are dessert options like Belgian waffle, although I did not try."}
{"text":"Great shawarma, they have shawarma burger amazing!! Great stuff very friendly!! Not expensive at all!! I love it !!! I go there with my wife all the time for take away !!"}
{"text":"Got the special, 2 chicken shawarma for $10. It was pretty good, everything was fresh and tasty though the portions were smaller than some other places. The place is clean and you can smell both shawarma and churros in this place so it makes things a bit more fun. Great if you're on the go"}
{"text":"a chicken shawarma is basically pita with toppings and a tiny sprinkle of chicken. Toppings included are only pickles (yes green ones) lettuce, tomato.. tabouli salad and tahini sauce ocst EXTRA even though they are a staple item on a shawarma. \"special sauce\" is a mayonaise relish mix, gross. $7.25 for a tiny, empty wrap... like all the others at this location, they wont last :( Too bad cause they are close to y home. Advice to owner, People want more than an empty pita for that price, where's the chicken and traditional shawarma toppings... slelct 3 free toppings makes more sense than charging most of them."}
