{"text":"This was a very pleasant dining experience for a family of five.  The garlic knots tasted wonderful.  Ordered a large salad and cheese sticks to start followed up with a pizza.  Provided enough food for everyone and tasted  great.  And all for a VERY reasonable price.  We will be returning here on future visits to Mentor."}
{"text":"Food used to be better but now is just ok. Most recent visit chicken was burnt and noodles tasted like burnt plastic. Service generally slow. Good pizza here."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered chicken wings (hot and mild) and a small pizza with two toppings. Delivery was prompt, and the food arrived hot. However the wing sauce was running out of the boxes because the foil was not fully lining the boxes! 
The wings were tough but the wing sauce tasty. 
The pizza was a real disappointment. The crust was poorly formed, the tomato sauce raw tasting.
Altogether it looks like Longo's has slipped since we last ordered from then."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service leaves something to be desired. Our delivery orders are wrong at least half the time. Sometimes very minor things and other times they have forgotten items. Also, delivery is not child friendly, as they will not deliver any items off of the children's menu, even if it is part of a large order."}
{"text":"Longo's is the bomb-diggety, the bee's knees, AND the cat's meow all in one.  I've been a fan of theirs since I was kid and my folks would order from their (now closed) Painesville restaurant.  They are my favorite pizza, hands down.  They are better than any pizza I've had down in Little Italy.

The handmade crust is perfect thickness, and is tender to the bite, not chewy like some places or cracker-like like you get from others.  The sauce stands out as it is is a bit spicy as opposed to the sweet sauces all around the area.  They use real chunks of sausage and meatballs on the pizza instead of the little rabbit-pellet sausages that the chains all seem to use.

They have a lot of other good stuff on the menu as well.  Their homemade soups are wonderful, especially the Italian wedding soup and the potato soup.  Their chicken tenders and huge, hand-breaded masterpieces.  And the chicken wings?  Sweet sassy molasses!  The wings are ginormous.  I am not a believer in evolution, but the theory teaches that chickens are descendants of dinosaurs.  Longo's wings seem to support that notion with these dinosaur sized wings.  I like both the General Tso and BBQ flavors.

Meatballs?  Yeah, boy,  Get you some.  Super tender, super flavorful.

Highly recommend Longo's!"}
{"text":"Longtime regulars for delivery! The last four times super long wait , incorrect or missing food. So today they owed missed items from week or so ago the order came way past time slot and the items they forgot last time they forgot again this time too!!! Now on too the quality of the food, boy has this slid downhill in past year and quantity come on a side salad can be more then ten pieces of romain lettuce veins a slice of tomato and a pinch of cheese for your prices ! Heck those little to go containers and you can see the bottom of it then you know it is a tiny salad.  Pretty sure we will not try a fifth time of getting it wrong."}
{"text":"This is one of two Longo's locations in the Mentor area. We had a large group of 22 and they let us order from the menu.  Most of the food appeared to be home made and portions were very generous.  Nothing fancy here, just nice folks with decent Italian food.   Garlic knots were offered pre-entree.  The service here was by young folks who were very polite and anxious to please.   Chicken parm with penne for me.  Not the place for date night, but great for casual dinner."}
{"text":"Calzones are excellent. Sauce comes on the side as well with the calzone. Pizza is good. I recommend the margarita pizza. They are friendly and we have never had an issue since ordering take out."}
{"text":"So grateful that this family continues to serve great food and at a growing amount of locations.  Husband enjoys their cold, draft beer.  All food is good but the items we order in mass quantity for impressive home party catering are:  the chicken tenders!!!  None better.  The batter or breading on them is superb!  The sauce they provide is high quality.  The pizza and calzone!!!  Never a complaint.  Try the ultimate chicken salad if you are a salad eater.  Whenever I order it, others envy me once it arrives at table.  During lent they have wonderful fish specials.  Enjoy!  Should mention that they did a wonderful job catering our post-funeral luncheon in their party room.  Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is decent but it's greasy. They give decent portions for the prices. We personally like their counterparts better - pastinas in mentor."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night and they had a band playing out on the patio.  My wife had the cavatelli dinner and I had the Sicilian calzone and we each had a small salad as well.  Both meals were very good and our server, Mitch H., did a great job of taking care of us. We'll stop here again."}
{"text":"One of the originators of what I know to be E Side CLE-style pizza, Longo's IS pizza in NEO to me. Like Zeppe's and Geppetto's, they crimp their pan-style crust at Longo's. of the three, I'd say Longo's usually has the sweetest sauce (but still nice and zesty) and a thicker, airy crust. The bite of Longo's pizza I tasted yesterday was the same one I tasted at the E 185 St Old World Festival back in the 90's, and the same one I enjoyed in Painesville a decade ago. They are only in Mentor / MOL now, but the legend lives on!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza to go, a large, half pepperoni and half mushroom and some garlic knots. When I picked it up that pizza was the smallest large I've ever seen. Whole family agreed and double checked it too. I checked the receipt, it was indeed a large. It tasted fine, nothing great, a suitable pizza. Same for the garlic knots. But it was hard to make that work for a family of 4 when you have two hungry guys.
So this place is crossed off my take out pizza list."}
{"text":"excellent!! I am from Independence but when I am in mentor I call Longo's best pizza on eastside!"}
{"text":"Talked to a woman named katie today i gave my info and was asking about different size pizza and toppings and specials they had and i asked if they had red onions and she said she didnt know and guessed and said green onions then said she doesnt actually know what color the onions are.. Food could or could not be good"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised as I really don't frequent this place but after a long day needed to eat so we opted for this restaurant. Ordered agli  olio spags and it was delicious. My wife opted for the chicken broccoli in alfredo sauce. Plenty of food, excellent service by Christina and she has quite the personality to go along with the service."}
{"text":"I had my bridal shower here earlier this year(2013). The food was pretty good. We order delivery from there a lot too! By far my favorite thing is the chicken Madison!!"}
{"text":"Food is average at best, but the reason for my review is the prices of the food. 17$ for 6 chicken tenders and a small pizza!?! The chicken tenders are trash also btw! Gauge much? Surprised you have been able to stay in business that long with prices like that. I will not be returning because I will have to take a loan out on my house just to afford a meal. Save yourself some time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Foods generally always delish but something's always missing from the bag. They're so busy in the store you don't want to hold everyone up checking the bag there. Worth is for the quality I just wish they wouldn't always forget my wife's pasta or salad so my night can be a bit better lol. Overall good pizza and legitimate boneless wings"}
