{"text":"When I first saw this L&L I was happy since I love Hawaiian bbq. Boy I regretted going here. I ordered the BBQ ribs but was given the chicken bbq. When I brought it up to the girl at the register she blamed me for the error then charged me another $2 for the difference. I had to wait another 5-7 minutes for my food. When I got my food there were a couple ribs the rest were pieces of meat with more fat than meat. (this isn't what I call ribs) I took a few bites then threw my food away. Had to stop at another restaurant for more food. This place is a waste of money. Next time I'll drive the few miles to Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"The only decent thing about this place is the food. It is nothing outstanding. I would consider the quality normal for Hawaiian BBQ, but I've definitely had better. The person at the counter was trying to be friendly, but I could tell she didn't want to be or was a shy person.

This place is also frugal with Napkins and silverware. They gave me 2 napkins, a fork and a knife for dining in. There is no place to freely grab more napkins, or when your plastic fork breaks like mine did, I couldn't just walk over and get a new one. I had to get someone's attention at the counter to give me another. This isn't a deal breaker, but definitely doesn't help with the experience.

If all you care about is food, the food is good, you should go. If you care about any of my other points, stay away!"}
{"text":"All in all, this place is pretty blah.  Nothing special...the chicken is dry, and their manapua is not made fresh--it's from a frozen bag.  The boba drinks tasted gross and the tapioca balls were undercooked.  Save the money and the trip out to Happy Valley and go to Ono's or Paradise Hawaiian BBQ.  If you think this is good plate lunch, you haven't had a good plate lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great food and they serve Pepsi! If they had home brewed iced tea with lemon it would be excellent. 
The BBQ chicken and the mix plate is my favorite. Make sure you get the mac salad. 
Chicken Katsu is tasty."}
{"text":"Eh. 

I've never been a huge fan of L&L and when I'm back in California I would rather eat at Ohno's or Ohana's. The same can be said with this one. I got a mini chicken-katsu with a taro boba. 

I definitely don't recommend the boba at all. I only got it because the boba place across Happy Valley Rd, Urban Boba Tea House, was closed and I was craving some. 

The macaroni salad was decent, the rice was too dry, and the katsu sauce was overly sweet. The chicken katsu was breaded and fried ok. The service was friendly though.

Next time however, I'm going to Leo's Island BBQ on Bell."}
{"text":"This L&L is great! I eat here way more than I probably should but I find their BBQ chicken plate to be so good! Chicken Katsu is also awesome. I have been to other L&Ls around the country and this one is much better than the others. Everything they make is always so fresh and hot when you get it. Never cold or made prior. Make sure to stop by here when you're in the Happy Valley area."}
{"text":"Food was the same, had a larger order menu. Bunch of different selections, and THEY GIVE YOUNA TON of food. I'll be back a second time to see if they do."}
{"text":"Living in the southeast and my wife is Hapa Haole girl we miss Hawaiian food. So as I travel to arizona and a L and L is next to Hotel Heaven just got closer. I have had the lao lao plate there and I thought I was at Auntys house. I will have to vist more before I go back to NC."}
{"text":"The salad was rotten, gooey & sticky lettuce (as if it had been drooled on!)  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Awefull food. Must of been a slow day. Food was dry and barely warm at this boulder highway location. Disgrace to hawaiian food. I would travel 15 miles west to get hot expected food from same company different owner."}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was super nice, a little too enthusiastic lol, but really nice. The food left something to be desired. It wasn't bad, just not really good and Hawaiian food isn't that difficult to make, so I have to give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"First experience was bad food and good service, gave it a second try 6 months later and the food was really good and service was ok. Teriyaki sauce isn't great, but the food didn't need a sauce so I will return."}
{"text":"I'm seriously just flippin excited this location is so close to me now! I'm gonna have to try not to order here too much.... But lezzzzzbehonest... I love me some Hawaiian BBQ! Omg yaaaaas!"}
{"text":"Going nuts this morning trying to find parts for my vehicle for my attempt at DIY repair this afternoon.  Driving all over North Phoenix was a little maddening with several of the major surface streets being restricted due to construction, causing choke-points at intersections. Did Chris Christie come into town?

Automotive parts in hand yet still seething (not raging and there's a difference) from the running around and bottleneck, I decide to have Loco Moco for lunch at L&L. I figured the carbs and calories will sustain me for the challenge I'm about to tackle head on. 

If you don't know what it is - Loco Moco that is; it's basically 2 over-easy (my liking) eggs, 2 hamburger patties over brown (my liking) rice drowning in brown gravy plus a side of macaroni salad.  Nothing really special about it because if you separate the components, you'd basically be eating what they taste like on its own.  The goodness is in the warm, hearty experience of devouring this Hawaiian comfort food. 

Overall, it hit the spot as always.  Now on to being a pretend grease monkey."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for awhile now and noticed they are getting stingy lately., not to mention they only give you one tiny container of sauce and then charges .50 cents more for each one!
I always brought cash because when you use your debit or credit card they ask if you want to leave a tip from 15% and up?? The owners are crazy to ask this when its take out or dine in, in which you just grab your food from the counter and sit down?? And on top of this they stand and stare at you like we're supposed to, no way!! Some nerve! 
I now eat at \"Leo's Island BBQ\" on 
Bell Rd just east of IN n Out they give you MORE food and all the sauce with NO extra charge!!!! I love the chicken katsu and rib combo plate, the chicken is actually tender and juicy, YES!!! The pictures below is just the Chicken Katsu plate in which they give you 3 Cutlets and 3 scoops of Macaroni salad, it comes with rice to but I'd rather have all Mac! The service is very good and they were busy non stop, I call in my order so I don't have to wait. I love this place it reminds me of home. They 
 are definitely the THE BEST FOOD AROUND!"}
{"text":"Visited this place with the intent of enjoying a delicious Hawaiian katsu chicken plate but we were far from it!  :/ Nothing but a great disappointment... 

The teriyaki sauce was the worse sauce I have ever tried. It was nothing but water! Water sauce should have be the label placed on the teriyaki sauce lol.  If you're looking for LARGE portion of food at a cheap cost please this place makes that happen. Poor service was the biggest contribution to my one star rating... Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food at L&L, and I have been a fan since it opened. The food at L&L is always great, that being said I just had my first bad experience. Lady behind the counter forced me to leave a tip in order to complete my order for food. I simply selected the smallest tip amount to be added to the price of my meal, to be over and done with it as there was a line behind me. It seems absurd to me to force people that are paying with a card to leave a tip when they are purchasing food at the walk up counter. What is the tip even for? They don't offer any table service, or even bring the food to your table! When your food is ready she screams out your number and you walk up to the counter and retrieve your own food. Been sitting here in the restaurant for 10 minutes and watching her do the same thing to every customer that pays with a card.  As a long time customer and fan of L&L, I find this very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was decent. If you like L&Ls, you know what you're getting. However, the kid working the counter was truly obnoxious. He immediately gave my party sass, complaining we interrupted his lunch break. He continued to be rude while we were ordering and even after when he literally said \"f--- you\" to another customer. He's going to say that to the wrong person one day, and the results won't be pretty.

The tables we also dirty with no napkins anywhere to be found to clean them off. 

I usually don't write reviews, but this warranted one. I'm glad I don't live in the same state as this place, so I don't have to visit here again."}
{"text":"had one of the best konkatsu when i was in town in phx!! we need more legits hawaiian restaurant in tucson!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loooooove L&L! It is tasty, the people there are friendly, and it is fast. It is the ONLY restaurant by our house that we frequent often, as we are pinchin pennies!  It would be awesome if I could find coupons for them though, cuz I'm a coupon cutter :)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! A Hawaiian joint should have a feeling of Aloha but staff here was somewhat rude. My to-go order was incorrect, and the fish was overcooked and clearly from frozen. Teriyaki sauce was inedible and even the pineapple chunks in the salad were canned. About 75% of this order ended up in my trash."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE FOR ANY REASON!!! The food is the worst BBQ I have ever eaten. How does one mess up teri chicken?? The \"lady\" who took our order was very rude. The teri sauce and katsu sauce were thr same thing, and it was soy sauce with sugar!!!!!
Hungey 11 year old baseball players wouldn't even eat it.
Do not eat here!!!"}
{"text":"So what can I say, it was meh at best.  We ordered the 1/2 beef and pork combo with white rice and the macaroni salad.  The beef was perfectly cooked but bland.  The BBQ pork why dry as the Sahara Desert.  We also ordered their healthy chicken option.  Once again the chicken was perfectly tender and bland.  It came with brown rice, salad, and some cabbage.  The salad and cabbage had absolutely nothing on it.  Put a little salt and vinegar on the cabbage or something and there are plenty of low fat options for salad dressing if you want to keep the healthy angle.  Would I go back and try it again?  At this point it's a coin flip."}
{"text":"Since I have moved from Tempe and I haven't been able to get my Hawaiian bbq fix from mai islands, I drove all the over to this L&L franchise..

I recently went to a place closer to my house that turned itself into a Chinese food and Hawaiian bqq place, and I have to admit that so far (in my quest), L&L had a better taste then the converted wok and grill place, however, it still isn't close to as good as Mai Islands (my fav place in Tempe)..

The macaroni salad and rice here were good quality, but the actual chicken just didn't cut it for me. It was a bit Rubbery and I couldn't cut it with a fork (I had to ask for a knife).. The service was sub par because a number of reasons.

1) After they took an order, the people left the front area, so you had to wait for someone to notice that you are waiting in the front to ask for a knife, sauce, etc..

2) The language barrier is pretty bad.. I feel like we both have no idea what the other person is saying.. 

3) Other then the Hello at the beginning, they weren't the friendliness.

Overall, the place is ok, not bad, not great, just ok and nothing compared to the place in Tempe.

I am going to take a trip to the other major franchise place and hope that it's closer to quality of the Tempe place."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ Chicken bowl. Tasted good. They skimped on the chicken. Also when you pay with a debit/credit card they tell you to press F1,F2, Etc. to indicate the amount of the tip you wanna pay (hmmm). Sierra Mist soda was \"watered down\". Also ordered a boba tea. That was good. The place was pretty clean. Overall we give it a 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill.  Cheaper utensils, napkins (I miss the old L&L printed ones) filled trash cans and filthy restrooms; I don't know where to start.  I hope they get their act together, I really want to like it again."}
{"text":"Ive always loved L&L, but this was my first and last time visiting this location. There was a very bad smell inside the restaurant when i walked in, the tables are very dirty, the vegetables are obviously cheap frozen veggies and the broccoli had a bad taste, like something you should probably throw away if you pulled it out of your own fridge. The chicken also appeared to be of a lower quality than the other L&L locations ive been to. And did i mention the smell of the place? The only reason im giving it 2 stars is because the girl at the front was very nice."}
{"text":"Love the fiod but disappointed thatt they always want to charge .50 more extra KATSU sauce. I ordered the chicken katsu and was just given 1 katsu sauce (not even filled full). When i asked for another to finish my meal I was told i would be charged.  This is not right. We come here all the time and for some reason they are always stingy with the sauce. I always eat it there so it's not like i am taking it home or anything.. They should call this dish something else if they are not willing to provide enough katsu sauce to complete the meal. Also they should recognize repeat customers or they won't be getting repeat customers."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've been going here for years now and I am impressed with the consistency. I am always happy with my meal.  The BBQ beef and chicken here is excellent and they cook a mean egg as well.  Give it a shot you'll love it."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!! My son- in-law left his credit card here And he called them. They said they'd keep it in a. \"Safe\" place until we could pick it up. We went back to get the card and they couldn't find it anywhere!!!! We waited 10 minutes as they searched and gave us lousy excuses. They kept telling us to just cancel the card but that can take a week or more to get a new one!! Then they wanted to take my phone number to call me when they found it!!! But we r passing thru and live 3 hours away!    So eventually they found it....in the TRASH!!!! Wow!!! I guess that's their SAFE PLACE???!!! Plus my son- in-law said DONT EAT THERE! THE FOOD IS GROSS!!!!   We're all part Hawaiian, NOTHING IN THERE TASTES any where near HAWAIIAN !!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Hawaiian food! You get good sized portions at an ok price. I typically get the loco moco, which is yummy and really filling! The last time I visited I decided to try new things, so I got the chicken katsu musubi and we split a soup.

 The musubi is kind of like a sushi roll with non-fish meats. It was ok, a little dry and I think it could have used a little more meat to rice ratio. I looked for some soy sauce but found some gelified katsu sauce. Eww. I just decided to eat it dry. The soup is like a ramen soup with great broth and meat. I got the beef, which was a little grizzly. 

The staff was a little cranky that night, but usually they are ok. The iced tea was empty and their condiments needed to be restocked."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved back to az from hi and were so excited to find our favorite fast food joint was on the mainland too!! All I can say is its our little slice of the Big Island!"}
{"text":"L&L here is as delicious as it is back home. I just wished their cheap asses would turn on the AC during the summer and maybe then their loud \"in door\" voices could be overlooked."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at this establishment. 

Cons:
Inside was filthy 
Loud screaming kids
One family of 4 taking up for tables and all the condiments 

The staff was rude and unfriendly 

When I asked about condiments at the counter I was shrugged off and told I had to ask the other patrons to share 


I will never eat here again


Update:


 as I'm sitting out side writing this review one of the employees comes to speak to me. He spoke no English and giggled every time I made a statement about how piss poor the service was"}
{"text":"Do not go here! The first warning should have been the employees were not even Hawaiin. They were Korean, and possibly the owners. To me that adds authenticity and ensure me that they know there food. The employees wee both rude, both the woman and the man. They also had there baby on the counter incessantly licking who knows what off of his hands the entire time we ordered. The portions were ridiculously small and the teriyaki sauce was watered down to a worthless point. The chicken was questionable and again small portions. Save your $ and treat yourself to Ono Hawaiin. Much larger portions and untouched quality of food and unmolested condiments."}
{"text":"There is a good variety of dishes and meats, and it is tasty but the quality of the meat is ok (but you really can't expect much more for the price).  It's a good alternative to your typical fast food fare, but nothing all too special."}
{"text":"So happy this business has opened on this side of town! The inside is clean, bright and inviting. The food is so delicious and flavorful. I had the luau pork and cabbage bowl while my boyfriend tried the spicy chicken plate and two sides of macaroni salad. Both servings were heaping with meat and the aroma hit before or forks even met the plate. I have eaten at a local competitor and I can honestly say I will never go back to them based on the experience at L&L. The meat was smokey with rich flavor and excellent texture, no fatty mystery meat here! The mac salad was even better than the \"other place.\" Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten a lot better. I stopped coming here a while back. The portions were getting smaller and the quality was going down. 
Recently I decided to give it another try and it was really good. They even have some new dishes, which were a good price and generous portion. 
Had another good dish tonight. I tried they're BBQ Chicken bowl with broccoli. 
Have to try another time and try the seafood plate again to see if the portion and quality has been fixed."}
{"text":"Do you ever have chicken katsu cravings?  If you don't, you're going to start having some after your visit.

What is it I love about their katsu...
1. The ratio of juicy meat to super crunchy panko breading is absolutely perfect, there's not too much chicken and the breading isn't so crunchy that it cuts up the roof of your mouth.
2. It will still be crispy after a 15 minute drive home.  
3. The creaminess of the macaroni salad is a perfect balance for the crispy katsu pieces.  Yes it may be cooked beyond al dente, but what do you expect?  This ain't no 5 star restaurant.  

I've had other things on the menu but what keeps me coming back is their chicken katsu and super friendly service."}
{"text":"After being in Hawaii for two weeks I tried this spot out and was blown away. The mac salad = amazing. The barbecue chicken and beef = amazing. Short ribs were also great! They have a location on the islands as well"}
{"text":"Finally ate here. I am really careful what I eat anymore as I am on a diet but....I have cheat meals so one of them included eating here. It is a really tiny place but don't let the size fool you. It's good food and friendly staff. I was told by the girl who I ordered from that I could always phone in an order before hand and come and pick up. I ordered Beef BBQ Saimin because I've been craving good decent broth and noodles. Place was really busy, guess Hawaiian BBQ is a good choice for this area.  I will be back to try more food on another cheat day. :)"}
{"text":"Worst lumpia I have ever had. 
The taro bubble drink was good.
Burger was blah.
The pork was ok but mostly rice.
The staff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ugh I don't know what they did but the saimin broth was horrible.  Truly awful, bland, muddy, and tasteless.  It was so bad.

Portuguese sausage musubi was very oily but edible.  Good spice.

The male Asian cashier pretty much forced a tip through the credit card machine, as he handed it to me with three options displayed, none of which were 0.

Cashier was later watching tv on his phone at the register.

Soy sauce was in re-used plastic bottles which was gross.

I won't go back, and am now actively discouraging people from going here."}
{"text":"NOTHING like it used to be... teriyaki sauce is watered down.  They have just simply gotten cheap.  Marconi salad was old and dried out.  Sad since I made a trip to come... Ono is much better."}
{"text":"Good place for some decent Hawaiian food. The menu is a bit scattered all over the place. It was good but if you have been to Hawaii and eaten some of the BBQ at the food trucks or even some of the restaurants, it's just not the same. The macaroni salad was a bit off but I'm not surprised as the kind they make in Hawaii is the bees knees. Still a good place for lunch though. I would go again."}
{"text":"I had never eaten here before but thought I would try it. I wasn't familiar with the menu so I was taking a few minutes to read it. I asked the cashier what a certain chicken dish was and got the reply it's chicken. After that smart ass answer I walked out and spent my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today! AMAZING! Customer service was excellent. I ordered delivery and they got to my house within 15 min! No joke! The food was so fresh. I ordered a mini Bbq chicken plate and mini chicken katsu. Also a 10 piece crab Rangoon. Everything was perfect. The macaroni was good. Rice cooked perfect! I've been forever looking for a good Hawaiian bbq and i finally found it just down the street."}
{"text":"Messed up my order. Couldn't understand English. Had to bring some guy from back to translate. Chicken katsu was hard. Ruined my appetite for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"While the food is delicious, their catering could use improvement. We had their catering for Memorial Day which included their BBQ beef, chicken katsu, macaroni salad, and salad. For $180 you think they would provide sauces, specifically katsu sauce, but no. You would think also for that price they would provide enough ranch for the salad, but again...no. It was literally half a fountain drink cup worth. In addition to that, we had to pick it up. If you're looking to stop in for some good Hawaiian BBQ stop here, but skip their catering."}
{"text":"I got sick from eating at this restaurant. I got the chicken Katsu. I love hawaiian bbq, and this was my 1st time trying this place. Go somewhere else. 
Also I tried to buy a soda after my 1st purchase and the card reader is said to only work if buying more than $5 worth of food. So instead of making the card reader work in my favor or just comping me the drink, I was afford to buy more food or to settle for a water cup. 
I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a month because they do a good job on the BBQ beef plate as well as having fresh Kimchi. It is a storefront style restaurant that is always busy. They get your food to you in a reasonable time. I have enjoyed all meals there so far."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing but the kid working behind the counter was extremely rude which means I won't be coming back :( it's very unfortunate"}
{"text":"got the chicken bbq plate.. lots of food and it was yummy. seemed very clean and fast service.. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I believe L&Ls quality of food have gone down throughout the years.  It is that or it has always been mediocre, but my taste buds accepted anything when I was in college.  However, I do remember, the katsu chicken was more meat and less breaded back in the day.

This particular L&Ls has its own flavor as they serve kimchee to the menu.  I think it's pretty cool each chain can add its own niche to their store.  What else can I say?  For those that have never had Hawaiian BBQ before, you will love the flavor and mac salad.  On the other hand, for those that know their Hawaiian BBQ, we have seen better days L&Ls.  We will come back when my wife and I get our occasional college cravings back in San Diego...although that does not happen very often."}
{"text":"Fake Hawaiian food. I would always eat L&L in San Jose when I would visit my family thinking it was just in San Jose, and when I moved to Phoenix and saw it, it made sense why it isn't so great. Any chain Hawaiian food is going to be bogus. It's expensive for what you get, and most of the food is really really bland. If you want good Hawaiian food, you have to find a local, hole in the wall place that actually knows how to make food taste good. I'll probably only go here again if my family wants it."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices.  Eating here brought back many good memories of being in Hawaii.  Jeff really enjoyed it, and mentioned he ate at the one in California a few times."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with Hawaiian food previously in Las Vegas, but this experience was completely different. Our cashier/server Ellie was incredibly kind, informative, and just super sweet. She helped me choose what to get, since I didn't have much experience with Hawaiian food. She was very polite and smiley. The food was amazing, the service was awesome, and inexpensive! I'll definitely be coming back to this location! Thanks Ellie."}
{"text":"Hawaiian Barbecue, replete with delicious BBQ shortribs, macaroni/mayo salad, white rice, and so on.  My favorite is the Kalua pork.  Also the short ribs.  I also like the Seafood combo - 3 breaded shrimp, a 4 oz. slab of Mahi Mahi, PLUS a serving of the aforementioned pork, ribs, or chicken.  This place can be busy, but is usually pretty quick to have my order ready to rumble.  Beware the intense garlic of the macaroni salad.   This place should be much busier"}
{"text":"I was so sad to see the leather repair shop close. That guy could fix anything! When I saw the L&L sign go up, I was a little happier and just could not wait to try it out. 

I ordered two rib plates, fried fish plate, and added chicken and a boba tea. The employee behind the counter was super sweet and my order was ready in a jiffy. The food was delicious, just what you would expect from L&L. 

The employee recognized and happily greeted a few repeat customers when they came in. I look forward to many more visits here."}
{"text":"5.99 for a smidgen of poke, food is consistently of poorer and poorer quality. I used to be a regular customer before these changes."}
{"text":"Finally this part of Henderson can get plate lunches again! L & L Hawaiian Barbeque is nestled here in strip mall where Smith's grocery store is, off Boulder Hwy. 

Traditional, simple, Hawaiian comfort food. None of that fusion/guac, beans burritos bowl thing (shudders) going on here, thank goodness.

Plate lunches under ten bucks. Portions are average. You get what you pay for.  Love that they have a Low Carb plate! 380 calories gets you 1 piece chicken, 1 piece beef and 2 eggs.  Perfect portion for me!  My plate was cooked to order, just off the grill.  Quality of meats are average. Beef was a little chewy but both tasted really good. Some places drown meat in sauces, so far, Im happy with the plate lunch I had today. 

Other menu faves here are Katsu Chicken, Loco Moco, I have yet to try.  There's a few Filipino dishes represented here in form of appetizers. Lumpia and Banana Lumpia! The banana pieces were good, but tiny pieces. Not sure if they're worth paying 1.75 for. If I want my sugar fix I'll just blow it at the donut shop next door, it's cheaper. 

Speaking of tiny, this place is really cozy if you are going to be dining in. Just warning you!  Dining area has tables for two or four people. Max 20.

They got it together as far as service. Friendly, quick and attentive. They were pretty quick to bus and clear out tables as soon as customers were ready to go. 

It's a fast casual restaurant.  Meaning you place and pay your orders at the counter with cashier, and someone will come out bring your order to you.

I like this location over the other Henderson one because it's still new, shiny and sanitary. That alone adds this place as a sure bet, I'll come more often to Lee & Lee now!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, I always order the loco moco, chicken katsu and spam musubi, but I was disappointed with their boba. I don't know if it's just the way they make boba in Hawaii but the black pearls were hard and dry and it was like they just put ice cubes and creamy coconut juice in there."}
{"text":"For the most part we've always liked L&L...but.....  Ordered the small poke, literally was a 2 biter, then no more.  Also ordered the BBQ Mix, loaded up on the chicken, and only gave you one (1) short rib.  The rice was long grain kine. I'm guessing the other, (med grain or sticky) they can't afford it???  The service was good and the restaurant was clean.  I'm now hesitant on ordering manapua here.  Thinking I'm gonna stick w/Leo's in Glendale."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!  Just like at home in Maui - and we have tried every \"Hawaiian\" restaurant in the Valley - no compare bra!  Chicken katsu and loco moco - the best - and not Hawaiian junk food - this is Hawaiian lifestyle food.  Aloha :)"}
{"text":"Good Hawaiian bbq.   Greets everyone with a loud \"ALOHA\" even though I doubt he's Hawaiian. Lol.  The Moco loco was pretty good but could u have used more salt and pepper.  The katsu chicken was also good but I wasn't a fan of the katsu sauce.   Macaroni salad was great and the rice was cooked well.   I'll probably return here"}
{"text":"Food is not perfect and service can lack at times. However, it is close to home and inexpensive. My favorite items are the BBQ chicken with rice, spam musubi, and the Thai boba drink. I come here often and in my opinion, it is good. But, again I am not picky with my food. I would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got the good reviews it did.

The food just wasn't that great.  Maybe I'm spoiled by what I can get at home (Philadelphia)?  I don't know.

I had the BBQ Combo and my girlfriend had the Mahi-Mahi Sandwich.  I dumped tons of teriyaki and BBQ sauce on the whole thing and just kinda scarfed it down.  She thought the sandwich was good and said that she regretted putting too much teriyaki sauce on it which made the bun soggy.  I also had some kind of sweet pork pastry.  It was kinda hard to stomach.  Maybe I'm being too rough, don't know.  

But I will say this: the blond-haired young man working the counter was extremely helpful and courteous.  He went through each and every item on the menu, explaining it to me and my girlfriend.  He was extremely knowledgeable and quick to suggest menu items for me and my vegetarian (but fish eating) girlfriend.

So, as my rating says, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Since moving from Hawaii back in 1995 to Arizona, I've been very skeptical about places that claim to serve \"Hawaiian\" food here, because as we all know, pineapple on a pizza does NOT make it Hawaiian. I know what Hawaiian-esque food is supposed to taste like. 

Right away I wasn't impressed because we weren't greeted by the customary Aloha that the person behind the counter is supposed to do to everyone entering the restaurant.  Some people were but not us. The place had the look and feel of a fast food restaurant. Dah that's because it was. The décor was made up of posters of Hawaii, Hawaiian Aloha shirts and a single surfboard on the walls. Not very impressive nor did it give you the feel of a restaurant in Hawaii. 

Anyway to the food. My wife ordered the Kalua Pork - Smoke-flavored, shredded pork with white rice mixed with cabbage. She immediately said it didn't taste anything like the pork we've had in Hawaii. It had no flavor so she added some  katsu sauce to it. That made it edible. She didn't even eat the rice or cabbage. I think she only ate the pork because she was hungry.   

I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 plate of chicken, & short ribs. It came with white rice, cabbage and macaroni salad. But the  macaroni salad was not cold because they placed the chicken which was hot on top of the macaroni salad so it was warm. The short ribs were NOTHING like I had when I lived in Hawaii. In addition to them not being \"authentic\" I've had better at local Asian restaurants or buffets. I have to admit the chicken wasn't that bad but again it wasn't \"authentic\" Hawaiian short ribs either. I dipped it in their teriyaki sauce which made it better. The short ribs on the other hand was so bad I didn't eat them. They were tasteless  and Hawaiian short ribs are normally amazing.  

I guess this is what happens when you try and eat Hawaiian food in a city like Phoenix that's the furthest you can possible get from Hawaii. I'll never come back here because of their false advertising and horrible food. Please change your name L&L Hawaiian BBQ, because this place is not Hawaiian.

FOOD: Maybe the original L & L in Hawaii is good but this L&L franchise location was truly  disappointing. The food was SUB-PAR  If I would have been satisfied with my meal maybe I wouldn't be judging this place so harshly. I was so disappointed that the food didn't live up to what the promises in its name. SERVICE:  The gal behind the counter represented everything but the spirit of Aloha was about. She had a look one her that said she wasn't very happy and didn't want to be there. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is high. AMBIANCE:The décor was made up of posters of Hawaii, Hawaiian Aloha shirts and a single surfboard on the walls. Not very impressive nor did it give you the feel of a restaurant in Hawaii. CONCLUSION: There's not really much to say here..I miss Hawaii... but what i miss more is the FOOD!  I spotted this place while visiting Applebee's and thought... OH MAN - THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING!  then I tried it. RETURN FACTOR 0%. 
  
    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"Used to be good, not so much anymore.
This was a 3-4 times/month take home for our family.

Over the past few months, they've changed how they server...their POS had a tip screen for take out and the food quality has steadily declined to the point our family no longer wishes to dine here....shame."}
{"text":"This is L&L... How can you go wrong? If you been to one L&L then you been to them all... It's a franchise, but they do a good job of it.

They do chicken katsu really good here... 

I like how they have poke and kim-chee but the poke is a bit over priced and it is loaded with onions... sometimes more onions that fish. Then again you can never put a price on good food. 

I really like the Lau Lau from here... It is rare that I can get good Lau Lau unless I am at someone's house and someone's grandmother made it.  

I like how they have the atkin's plate for those who are watching carbs... Portions are big so I would think about going with the mini plate and try 2 different things. 

The spam musubi is good for what it is... A piece of pan seared spam over rice wrapped up in seaweed... Sometimes I think it is too much rice but it is not like you can't take some of the rice out."}
{"text":"I was here one night to get some dishes to go.  Honestly, I don't understand why the rating is so high.  Maybe I went on the wrong night.  The decor is really cute and the service is really nice but...that's pretty much it.  

I ordered L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix, Seafood Mix, and Spam musubi.  

The first problem was rice.  Part of it was overcooked and soggy, the other part, uncooked.  Any Asian dish has to have at least \"descent\" rice to enjoy the rest of the plate.    

The second problem was the seafood.  I understand that this is not Roy's but still, it would have been nice if they could have given me a real piece of fish and shrimps instead of all panko and batter.

*Food = badly cooked rice ruined pretty much everything
*Decor = very cute
*Location = it looked a little shady but it was around 8pm and very dark
*Service = very nice
*Price = ok but not worth what I received."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and we were excited to see a Hawaiian food place near us. Then we read the reviews... I think we will have to pass and go to the places we know. Pretty bummed! Maybe someday we will be courageous enough, but nothing excuses bad customer service."}
{"text":"Almost as good as the chain in Hawaii....
Seafood combo is waht we get. MAC SALAD IS AWESOME"}
{"text":"The food is great. This has become my go to spot for close food fast. I have eaten here at least once a week since moving to Phoenix. I tried to go healthier and get the brown rice... that lasted 2 attempts. the rice wasnt cooked all the way, and had too much crunch. BUT going back to what they do best. 1/2 BBQ Chicken, 1/2 BBQ Short Ribs, 2 scoops of rice, and macaroni salad..... well, its had be going back over and over. 
Highly recommended.
the ONLY reasons i didnt give it a 5 star rating was the bad brown rice, and the Boba Tea wasnt that great. In past I've had the Boba served warm at the bottom of the drink that made it less rubbery. This was not the Boba Tea I was used to, BUT everything else makes this place a winner."}
{"text":"I only had the spam musubi but it was the best I've ever had.  The counter person was very friendly.  We will have to try lunch another time when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Being from hawaii, I love me some good hawaiian bbq and this is as close as I am going to get without having to get a plane ticket or having to beg my mom to cook some for me.
 
BBQ Short Ribs: hit or miss. Sometimes they are amazing and sometimes they are too fatty and chewy.
Chicken Katsu: Good, sometimes can get over-cooked.

Both come with rice and (my fav) Mac Salad. 

Spam Musibi is spot on here and the saimen is good."}
{"text":"Ono! This is the real thing - fast food Hawaiian Style.  

When we were in Kona last December we had lunch at an L&L --- because we wanted local food and they were the busiest place we saw.  Well, the menu is exactly the same at the north Phoenix location (they also have one in Mesa).  It may not be the healthiest food, but it sure is good!

L&L is in the Happy Valley Town Center shopping center (at Happy Valley Rd and I-17), across the parking lot from Lowe's.

Note that the Aloha Kitchen in Mesa, Arizona is more of a Hawaiian style mom and pop corner restaurant than is L&L - if you prefer that."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town who grew up in Hawaii, and she was excited to try out L&L. She said it was like being home again. I really enjoyed the bbq beef bowl. Not only was it a great portion size it was also yummy! I did not think that any extra teriyaki sauce or extras were needed. The rice and the beef worked great together. We came in right before they closed, and they let us stay a few minutes later to finish our food. Some of the best Hawaiian food that I have found in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Broke down tried it.... And now I can say I did. Nope. I'm done.  Way better ways to spend $20 for lunch for 2 people.  Completely unimpressed. Lackluster food."}
{"text":"The amount of food you get is awesome! For a small price, they load your plate. Plus it tasted great! The lady who took my order was a sweetheart. Five  stars for customer service,  taste and amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, clean restaurant. They have never messed up an order. Their BBQ chicken and beef bowls are great! Also love the spam musubi. I've tried the ramen burger but it was honestly more fun to look at than to eat. Their pork lumpias are perfectly crisp and juicy. Over all I'm glad they opened up this location."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I seen a new cook and a new girl at the register. The girl definitely didn't know what she was doing. She made my Thai tea with boba way too sweet so I threw it away. I ordered 2 short rib plates and the new cook back there did a terrible job because me and my boyfriend looked at each others short ribs and mine had totally different bones in the meat so that there shows something iffy is going on and we taste them both and they both taste off. The macaroni salad was too salty and mushy . I was so upset and WONT be coming back until I see the regular chef that makes me food all the time and the other girl at the cash register there. The nastiest meat I've ever had from there. we were literally trying to figure out what type of meat they gave us because it didn't taste normal . now we both feel sick"}
{"text":"Tried L & L again. Arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday for lunch. There were 18 people at the tables but only six were eating. Could be a long wait. 

I ordered the combo: 1/2 Chicken Katsu and 1/2 BBQ Shirt Ribs. It also came with rice, macaroni  salad and slaw. I added a drink for $11.37 with tax. Pretty steep for fast food but it wasn't so fast. 

My order arrived in 13 minutes. It was hot, crispy and tasty but rather steep for plastic plates, forks and a 13 minute wait. I did like the self-serve drinks and sauces but they ran out of iced tea at noon. 

They should probably ramp up staffing for lunch. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I'm digging that they have some korean food here too... they are quick and easy.  It's a TON of food, by the way, so bring your hollow leg.

I'm not too fond of the katsu... I think it's just not really my thing.  But the service is good, place is clean."}
{"text":"i have been living in arizona for three years now. L&L is really the only good hawaiian food place we have here that is comparable to home. it's a chain restaurant that we have in hawaii, so there is consistency! 

i had the opportunity to stop by again yesterday on our way up the i17 to flagstaff. jared, the guy behind the counter was so nice. he has the spirit of aloha instilled in him! it's such a nice thing to see up here far from home. 

the husband and i ordered our usual suspects: chicken katsu and bbq chicken. also, got some mini manapua for the road. 

we even stopped again on the way home to tucson (that's how ono it is!) since i know i won't be able to have L&L again til i go home to the islands in may."}
{"text":"If you look online, they don't have most of their menu listed?!? Their food is always good and cheap. Love their Hawaiian drinks. 10 chicken potstickers for $4.99 and the best sauce I've had in town."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! Foods taste really good and it pretty  cheap .Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Not that good, not that bad.  So-so, more or less.

Stopped by here for lunch the other day, I had the BBQ chicken lunch.  Overall a pretty bland taste, but maybe that is just the style.  If I ever end up here again I may try something else, but I won't be going out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Was so excited the moment I saw the guy holding the card board that there's an L&L in the area, I had to make a you turn, got me some good food! There's a lot of fast foods here like burgers and fries but I wanted real food! I'm half asian and Hawaiian good Is similar."}
{"text":"This place sucks  HORRIBLE service, most of the workers can't speak English and are lost when your ordering, extremely rude, no customer service skills, if you want this type of food go to BELL Rd and 101 to Leo's BBQ where food taste better, and they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"We get excited when ANY new food place opens up in 'old' Hendo, however we were extra excited when we saw that L & L was going to open in our frequently visited Smith's shopping center. EVERYTHING on the menu sounds like it would be heaven to eat, and I know everything IS delicious. Being no stranger to 'Hawaiian' food, we welcomed L & L with open arms, into our 'hood. After our weekly grocery shopping trip, the husband and I (finally) stopped in for dinner. We ordered for 5 of us, though it would seem like we were feeding a lot more people LOL. Even the very sweet girl behind the counter joked that she thought we were having  a party with the amount of items we ordered. 

We tried a kalbi mixed plate, chicken katsu mini plates, hawaiian bbq chicken, a spam musubi combo, ahi poke (small size), and I absolutely needed a thai tea boba. Every item was delicious and flavorful. The tea was perfect, and the portion sizes were perfect. The rice was cooked perfectly sticky, the macaroni salad tasted great. The portion sizes were on par with the legendary heaping plate lunch reputation of most Hawaiian food places, and that includes the mini sizes as well. 

I noticed while waiting for our food, that the menu had calorie information on it, and the restaurant offers healthy plate lunch options as well. Grilled fish and chicken with veggies and brown rice. Perfect!

Welcome to the 'hood, L & L. So happy you're here!"}
{"text":"I didn't know until my X told me (she's a native from Hawaii) that L&L is straight outta Hawaii. I guess this location in North Phoenix is the only one in Arizona. 

The food here is great. They have a lot to order and even though I haven't tried everything I'm sure it's all great. 

My favorite is the combo chicken beef combo. It looks great and smells great so you obviously can say it taste amazing. 

I would recommend this to anyone especially people from the Islands. 

Mahalo :)"}
{"text":"The food I was able to order was great. They display a full menu but don't update selection so it can be hit or miss. Service could have been better."}
{"text":"This place is good most of the time and I have to say the last two times I went was just not like normal today for example the soda machine something was wrong the 3 drinks we tried tasted strange so I let the cashier know and she tasted it and did nothing else to fix the machine and said we could get a bottled drink instead also we were eating there and it was 4 of use sharing a few items the only had 2 plates for us to use I asked for some ketchup the cashier says it's on the table which well it wasn't on the table we were at it was on one table and I had to go get it the ribs were super fatty and not alot of meat on them and that happened the last time we went too that's why we hadn't been back in awhile but we decided to try it again to same issues and the fried shrimp was way over cooked and looked kind of old really use to love this place sad when a place starts out so great then let's itself go just seems like customer service wasn't a priority I mean to not even have enough plates for ur guests to use and didn't seem to care since every time I had to ask for something the cashier was on her phone texting"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over 3 years. The food is always great, and the staff are friendly. My favorite thing to order is the \"Loco Moco\". The \"Bento Box\" and \"Kaluah Pork\" are very good here as well!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy amazing Hawaiian barbecue! I travel long and far for L&L and this location is just like the rest. Make sure you ask for a lot of napkins, they keep them behind the register, which is a little annoying."}
{"text":"I ordered L&L catering for a party I had. I got chicken katsu, luau pork, teriyaki beef, mac salad, rice, and spam musibi. The food was a total hit at the party! Everyone loved it. It was ready early and came with all the necessary sauces. I will be eating there again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had terriyaki chicken.  The chicken was bits of grizzle and tendons and the macaroni salad was swimming in mayo.  No me gusta."}
{"text":"Authentic! is the best word to describe this place. 

Food: very tasty and REAL.  Big servings as well. 

Ambience: typical fast food Hawaiian/Asian food chain. Not the cleanest place in the world but who cares! 

Service: decent. They can improve. 

Price: cheap and very reasonable! About $10 a meal. 

Try this place out! See for yourself! I always go here and have always left this place very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Like getting take out here!  There's not a lot of choice in the area and this can hit the spot when craving Hawaiian food.  Recommend the bento and the shrimp curry.  Brown rice is a touch dry and the poke may not be worth the money.  Super easy to pick up and staff is nice and quick.  Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Tried to order some food and the teen behind the register was being so obnoxious I walked out. Unbelievable how rude he was being to customers. I've been this place many times and I'm afraid I won't be going back. The food is not good enough to tolerate that kind of service."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not as good as I imagined. No, this was not my first time, but the taste was a lot different from before. None the less it was good. Service was Great! The cashier greeted us nicely and knew her way around the menu. The food was fresh and hot, defiantly Plus Points!"}
{"text":"It's not Hawaii, but it's as close as it gets on the mainland.  I really wanted to try \"Mai Family\" but as it was closed on the weekend, this was the substitute.  The \"mini-plates\" of Chicken Katsu and BBQ Chicken were more than enough food for the two of us.  I'm both scared and intrigued how big the normal plates were."}
{"text":"Hey here is something off the beaten path ..Polynesian junk food , complete with sides of spam , macaroni salad dripping with mayonnaise and lots of sides of rice. Did i mention they Bobo? They have added items  posted on the wall like Poi , Portuguese Sausage, Kim Chee and  some spam sides.  While not exactly the most amazing food it was tasty in the way that sometimes you get something at a food court at the mall  that's tasty.  It had interesting BBQ like meat , that almost was teriyaki but not quite.  The plain  rice was of course plain.   The food was plentiful , all in all not bad , and something unique to try .  Business looks steady and many people seemed to walk in and know exactly what they wanted and needed."}
{"text":"... Since everyone's taste is different, this place didn't suit me or my husband. That being said, maybe you'll enjoy it...??
We visited Hawaii for our honeymoon and saw an L&L there, as well, and remembered our experience at the Happy Valley location and it was enough to warrant not visiting a potential original location..... Meh. Again, maybe you'll find it more enjoyable, but we won't be back.. It's kind of an inside joke when we drive by actually.."}
{"text":"the food is pretty good..today my husband went in to get some chicken and when he had to pay with the card the tip message showed 15%,20%..and as I red in other posts there was a no tip message ,so my husband left a tip because he didn't ask how to cancel the tip message ..reading another review I saw you have to type 0..I found this very not ok when my husband told me ..it's the very first business we ever experienced something like this ..pretty annoying I have to say ..totally hope the business is gonna change the way they ask for tips"}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience at L&L today.  Poor service--stood around waiting for anyone to come out of the kitchen, cashier stared above my head.  Never gave me my number but then expects me to know it when he calls it.   Food was bland and disgusting--teriyaki sauce smelled like sewage, shrimp was overcooked frozen.  Mac salad is good but bc it's in a Styrofoam container with the other food it starts to taste like teriyaki sewage after a while. Shrimp in soup not peeled."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I found this L&L not to far away.food made to order and always good huge plates.i especially like the BBQ chicken plate what more can I say Hawaiian food is my comfort food: )"}
{"text":"The chicken Katsu combo was perfect!:) but don't try the boba!! Tried the coconut and it was nasty. I'll stick to \"bomb boba\" on cactus from here on out."}
{"text":"Fast preparation of my order and huge portions of chicken! And always fresh.. I'd love to eat this stuff everyday!"}
{"text":"Been eating lunch here for about 4-5 years, maybe longer!! I love the mahi mahi, bbq chicken, and the mac salad!! 
L&L also has Boba! They don't have a blender tho, so it's limited to boba tea's, including Taro!!! (My favorite)
There's a laid back beachy vibe, casual seating, and the full menu of Hawaiian bbq delights and tropical sodas, too. Musubi, lau lau, Katsu donburi, and other classics available. 

You can go comfort style eating, or healthy style. 
I had the garlic grilled mahi mahi plate today with brown rice and inspired side salad...pleasant surprise!!! Mixed greens including spinach, pineapple!!, cherry tomato, and cucumber with a teriyaki dressing. It really hit the spot. It was a very well balanced meal.

Service has always been prompt, and friendly over the years. Even during the lunch rush, it's a short wait, and the location has remained well maintained  inside. Sometimes I go weeks or a few months without stopping in, so there have been new faces over the years, but the positive attitudes are always the same. Quality of food has been consistently great. Never had a complaint yet. 

L&L is my favorite Hawaiian bbq stop I've had in the valley, check it out next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"I am torn between a 1 & 2 star, but I need to be truthful here. This is based on my meal here with the seafood combo at under $9 dollars.  The combo comes with mahi mahi fish, shrimp and your choice of meats: chicken, pulled pork or short ribs, macaroni salad and rice.  I chose the chicken and my brother had the pulled pork.

PRO:  
Large portion.

CONS: 
* Although combo portion is large it was completely inedible. (My meal ended up in the garbage.)
* Everything was TASTELESS minus mahi mahi and not in a good way.  It was the most pungent and extremely Fishy, Foul tasting fish I've ever had.  The food was NOT good whatsoever.  Perhaps it was this combo item.  
* The condiments:  Siracha and terriyaki sauce was heavily watered down DELIBERATELY.

My brother agreed with the great disappointment and he was picking through his meal.  He was extremely hungry and we thought this was a place to satisfy his hunger. I regret not having lunch at the suggested Greek place next door, but he thought the portions may not be filling. :("}
{"text":"I will be a honest i used to a believer and used to come here often. Yet recent visits seems to make me feel that this place has lost its touch.

4 reasons: (each points is a star minus.)

1. I am a spam masubi guy and I probably have gone to most of the places that serves them in the valley. This place was my go to before until i start tasting others. Today I ordered 2 more for old time sake and i cant believe that this was the same spam masubi I tasted before. First theres so much rice, so much that you cant even taste the spam. Theres so little sauce. I even told the guy for extra sauce and checked my order and theres still so little sauce. As a guy who loves spam masubi, i had my share of experience on making them, and if my spam masubi is better than the one you can buy in any place, then that place needs some changes. You go out to eat a better food that is not in your house- thats the essence of eating out.

2. Their soup has no flavor. No joke. Try it. I dare you.

3. If youre vegeterian or feeling dieting for a day please dont buy their healthy salmon. The fish has no flavor at all. Almost made me puke:(.

4. Lastly it seems they stop listening to customers. When I we used to eat here all our request were fulfilled. If you ask more sauce on your food you get initially. If you ask for put the lettuce on the side cuase maybe your allergic they do it. If ask for extra gravy you get them in the side. Yet now all our request seems to be neglected. As my friend said, it feels like they are slimming their food. Maybe to get more profit?

Anyways, the experience is no longer there and the taste is basically gone. Maybe those who havent tried other places might find them really good. But to those who have tasted others I request you to try it once. If you like it disregard my review. For me this is the last time I am driving 45 minutes for their food (yeah i was dedicated).

P.S 
One star for the nostalgic part of it. Also yelp wont allow 0 star."}
{"text":"Ever since living in Las Vegas, I have been in love with this place! Employees are nice but there is a slight language barrier.... the macaroni salad is the best! Get an extra scoop! I also like the bbq chicken, Katsu is delicious too! I heard a lady saying the loco moco was good there! That will have to be on my list to try sometime! 

- tried the loco moco and was disappointed. I make this at home sometimes and use an angus beef patty seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning. Then throw it on white rice, medium egg, topped with brown gravy. It's delicious! I tried it here and the patty tasted like it was a piece of frozen Salisbury steak, and my egg was hard! I guess I'll stick to making this one at home!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS bbq combo plate. didn't get much else but loved the chicken, beef, and short ribs. i could do without the rice and macaroni salad but if it's the hawaiian thing to eat with this, ok fine. my mouth is watering thinking about the meat. yum yum. i would totally do platters of that to cater a party."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat, I come her once every pay period.(even if I'm extreme dieting its my cheat meal) the food is always so tasty and satisfying. They have healthier alternatives to all of there meals which is a nice perk. For about 2 years now I've always had the BBQ chicken meal. Recommend this to anyone trying to try something new!"}
{"text":"This is basically the closest you can get to have local hawaiian food without actually being in Hawaii. They make everything the way it's supposed to taste like back home - and they even have laulau! A total menu must have if you're going to claim to be a \"Hawaiian\" restaurant, but since L&L is a Hawaii based chain I wasn't too worried about that!

The regular plate lunch sizes are really big so I always end up getting the mini. Among my favorites are the chicken katsu, roast pork with gravy, manapua, and the saimin. 

And as a side note - you might not want to come here if you're trying to watch your weight, Hawaiian food in general is high calorie-laden goodness which is why I always leave this place full and happy!"}
{"text":"Hubs wanted to check out this newer L&L last night rather than our usual spot. He was excited because they'll let you do the combos half & half with two different kinds of meat. 
Hubs got half BBQ chicken half chicken katsu and raved about it all night. He said the coating on the katsu was better than any of the other places we have tried it and said it wasn't overly hard or crunchy. He was thrilled!
I did the BBQ chicken bowl and a spam musubi, and they were kind enough to throw an egg roll in for us for free! I wasn't a huge fan of the egg roll but that's a personal preference. I liked that the bowl had some other veggies (carrots and peas) rather than just broccoli like most places. It was good! The cashier hooked us up with TONS of extra teriyaki sauce, just the way I like it! The bowl was a huge portion with lots of rice. 
Service was friendly, food came out fast, and the restaurant was super clean. We took our food to go, but I wouldn't mind eating in. The tables were cute and comfy. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We go to L&L alot and this one is pretty good. Banana lumpia is delicious. It's small so we always carry out. Call ahead and you won't have to wait."}
{"text":"It was nice. The cashier was chipper. The food was just like the L&L in Oahu. Wish they would crank the A/C a little more though.

Restroom was a little dirty."}
{"text":"Let's see, the kid behind the counter is annoying...the pork is dry, the lau lau tastes like pork that came out of a fish's butt.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place...my wife and I discovered it after returning from a trip to Hawaii. We ate at one of the L&Ls in Oahu several times and were pleased to find one down the street from us at home
The mixed plate is the best way to eat at L&L for the first time - you get Korean style BBQ Ribs, beef and chicken with rice and the ever present macaroni salad (every Hawaiian I have ever met has their own recipe for macaroni salad).
Also, try the Masubi (sp?)...it is a kind of Spam sushi...I know - SPAM! But it is actually very good.
Finish off the meal with a Guava juice - and you are in the islands."}
{"text":"****update- my credit card information was skimmed from their credit card reader and i got a 319/dollar charge from vista print twice 10 mins after I left there and had to shut down my card..do not go here ! *****

I keep forgetting to check rating before i eat at places..ugh! 

The food here is not fresh. The bbq beef is fatty, oily and old. Seems like its been sitting for a few hours was ready very fast and med warm. 

Rice was soggy. 

Will not repeat."}
{"text":"I used to live in Hawaii so when We moved to the area I was excited to see L&L

I called in for pick up- the guy who answered the phone was pretty much annoyed that I was calling in. I tried to ask questions about some combo items and he wouldn't listen and just kept trying to finish the order.

We got to the restaurant to pick up the food. My husband ran in and came out really frustrated. He said the cashier was rude and annoyed that he had a customer. My husband asked for extra napkins and sauce containers which apparently really annoyed the guy.

Two stars for awful lame service. The food is fine but I don't like to patronize stores where the staff make you feel like a burden. 

The receipt showed this rude guy as the Manager- I sincerely hope not!"}
{"text":"The food here is good not great but I only come when Da valley Grill is closed.  The lady at the register is very pushy for tips when all they are doing is taking your order. I try not to use my card here because I heard of information being stolen from here."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when there's nothing else you want and because its conveniently nearby.  Sometimes you can never go wrong coming here.  

Haven't been in here in a long time, but because it was new to the area, I decided to come in.  I ordered their BBQ Chicken, the one on the healthier side and a half order of the poke.  I liked the amount chicken given for the amount paid.  The chicken was a little bit on the salty side.  The 1/2 order of poke for I want to say I paid $6.00 is ridiculously priced.  

With that being said, happy eatings! @~~}~~~~"}
{"text":"More toward 2.5 stars.  The people are nice and the place is clean, but the food is not as good as it was a couple of years ago.  Not sure why.  They've added a lot to the menu like boba tea, sesame balls, and malasadas, but it makes me wonder if they're branching out too much.  (I haven't tried any of those items so can't comment on them.)  I might still eat here occasionally if I'm shopping in the plaza and craving BBQ beef or saimin, but you can find better fare at some of the other Hawaiian joints in the Valley."}
{"text":"Hellooooooooooo Spam Musubi! 
My favorite Hawaiian concoction - grilled marinated Spam on a bed of rice, wrapped in seaweed - spam sushi! Ingenius. For the Spam-shy, they also have a Chicken Musubi.

L&L was my first venture into Hawaiian BBQ back in college. Cheap, large portions, deeeeeeeeeelish BBQ Chicken - MMM! Even the mini plates (in the $5 range) are good portions (probably what would be closer to a healthy serving...).

As far as authenticity.... now, while some L&L locations really suck, L&L originated IN Hawaii, and having just been to HI a year ago, I'd say that this location does a smashing job of getting it right. YUM!"}
{"text":"Really good fried mahi Mahdi. Clean and fairly friendly.  Great macaroni salad. Prices were fair and portion was big."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place since the first time I tried the seafood combo! Omg it's to die for!! I highly recommend this and many other dishes on their yummy menu."}
{"text":"Every aspect of this food is genuine Hawaiian. Except the service. I dare you to try and ask for a taste of the Poi. Not gonna happen. Shame on the owners for not bringing island love with its food."}
{"text":"Can't hate on some L&L, Grew up in hawaii through middle school and high school. Back home L&L is considered fast food, generally you get your plate lunch from a truck or local restaurant not L&L.  But when your on the main land, L&L is a blessing!! Closest thing you can get and I'm not complaining.

For those of you that are looking for something to try, Chicken Katsu is always a good starter, basically breaded chicken with a tangy dipping sauce.  

My go to meal is the Hamburger Steak, 2 hamburger patties covered in gravy with rice.  It just works!! Other good choice would be the Kalua pork. You can always get half/half and add some BBQ too.

Make sure you try the Mac Salad, I'm not normally a big fan of mac salad but its a must here! 

Great service to boot also."}
{"text":"good food, cheap owners.  If its hot outside, the ac is turned off, if its cold the heater is off. The person taking your money is the same person who handles your forks and knives.  Bathroom always smells, many times out of soap.  on many occasions the kids are behind the counter running around like monkeys.  when you ask them for some air conditioning all of a sudden there english gets very broken.  weird.  Fed up with the cheap ass owners."}
{"text":"Don't go.  First off, like other reviews if you pay with your card your forced to tip.  Second, don't order the malasadas or manapua, frickin garbage. Short ribs were cold.  Katsu was actually good.  Nothing local about this place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat out when my kids and I are meeting my husband for lunch on his lunch break. I love their shrimp plate with rice and macaroni salad. My daughter loves the same plate, though she foregoes the mac salad for extra rice. My three year old eats off of our plates and gets fresh, hot french fries. My husband likes their pork bbq plate with the rice and mac salad. The help is always friendly and always greet us with a happy, \"Aloha.\" Definitely love this place."}
{"text":"Got the half half plate with kalua pork and katsu. 

Food is alright....nothing special. 
Price is fair and quantity is good. 
The restaurant is clean, the girl behind the counter was friendly and helpful and the restaurant is in a good location. 

Probably wouldn't come back just because I wasn't so impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Although I still come here, I notice lately there isn't even any Hawaiian Music. There used to be, and it's too bad.  Also, the tables and chairs are usually dirty when I eat in and the cashier is often playing on his cell phone while customers try to clean their own tables. I also noticed many customers saying thank you to the cashier including me but we all received no response from him.  Otherwise if you don't care too much about these things, the food is still good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this L&L's for 5+ years and it's been consistently good. I love their BBQ mix plates, their macaroni salad is BOMB. Dumplings are a lil pricey but really good! They have smaller size plates which I find accommodating especially for lunch! Wish they had better drink options but you don't go their for the Cola you go for the bbq mix, duh. You gotta ask for everything and service gets the job done but it's not a traditional place... Now this rate is solely on their food, quality, and taste- also it's a fast food kinda place, yes it's all made to order so don't expect some authentic Hawaiian BBQ Place but it's really good for what it is! It's a clean place, their condiments station is another story but whateves don't judge a book by its cover here. I'd give them 5 stars if they had a cleaner station that included napkins & utensils to get yourself and dine in plates."}
{"text":"We ordered catered pans BBQ chicken , katsu chicken, rice and mac salad....was hot and super delish. ..all my guests loved it as well...this was for my son's graduation party.... it was a very successful party...thanks L & L Hawaiian BBQ!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it was exactly, but I just wasn't a huge fan. I only tried them once, since I was on vacation in the area, but I ordered a BBQ chicken salad which was simply ok."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, the meal is very happy here, the service attitude is very good, will come often later"}
{"text":"Not the best in town, but decent enough to fill my stomach void when craving Hawaiian BBQ. I went with the kalbi short ribs plate and those did not disappoint. However, my mayonnaise salad with elbow macaroni shells unfortunately got tossed into the trash. Holy mayonnaise, Batman! We also decided to try their \"lumpia.\" Whatever you do, DO. NOT. GET. THE. LUMPIA. Whatever they serve up and call \"lumpia\" is a frozen disgrace and embarrassment of what should be a fried and delectable pastry. 

Service was relatively quick, but had to beg for extra napkins as they were stashed behind the counter. Overall an inexpensive place for some pretty tasty kalbi short ribs. Would I ever go back? Probably not; I'll drive a tad longer for some Golden Hawaiian."}
{"text":"It's a typical L&L. They have added a lot of healthy dishes to their menu. I go there to get my Hawaiian food fix. No one else close serves lau lau. They have Atkins, low carb and medifast smart dishes. Not a fan of the fried manapua. My daughter gets her musubis and boba tea. Otherwise a good choice!"}
{"text":"Well had an opportunity to drop in, a coworker really likes to eat here when in town.   Have to say the food quality has really improved.   The service was much better as well.

In short I am happy to say they are back on my short list of places I like to go, we'll done L&L Hawaiian!"}
{"text":"It's been 10 years since I left Hawaii, and its been so long since I found an ono grind place here in Arizona!

Love it! 5yrs ago, I first walked in this place and cried my eyes out! So many memories on the walls and the smell of grinds cooking!

I had to order one of everything on the menu just because I missed it so much!!

They knew I was native when they saw me crying and taking pictures of everything, the owner gave me tonz of stickers and keychains and extra food!! It was so awesome!! I didn't want to leave!!

the food is so like home, we now order take out all the time!!"}
{"text":"g spent a good amount of time living in hawaii as a kid so when L&L opened just minutes from our house he was stoked. we both agree that this isn't the highest quality food, but man you get one hell of a plate lunch here. lately i've been frequenting L&L far more than usual because g reminded me they have atkins plates. the atkins mini plate gives me a giant serving of chicken, barbecue beef and a scrambled egg for under $5. it is tasty. and filling. i like it. g always orders the kalua pig, all rice, no macaroni. it is pretty darn good, but truth-be-told aloha kitchen makes a much better kalua. if i'm not low-carbing i love the garlic shrimp, and the chicken katsu and various other fried, carb-laden hawaiian junk food options.

there's a sign on the wall that teases me. it says \"chicken long rice\" but every time i try to order it i'm told it isn't chicken long rice day. i'd say screw it on the low carb diet if only they'd quit teasing me about the chicken long rice. i've been told the signs located under the menu are items that are available; signs on the other wall are there for occasional use. i really hope it is chicken long rice day soon."}
{"text":"Love L&L! I love the Hawaiian juice choices. And I love their low calorie menu. It's delicious. My only complaint is that I have seen them on a couple occasions serve other customers with massive orders who ordered after me when I only had a simple bowl. It seemed like they maybe knew the workers, but it's a little annoying that it has happened more than once."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian grindz that cured my craving for da spam musubi!  Definitely nothing fancy, but I wouldn't expect it to be.  The atmosphere is simple, the service is friendly and da food is crazy ono.  Just like back home in da aina!"}
{"text":"The service was bad. They refused to alter an order claiming it was due to the franchise. It was as simple as leaving the veggies out and incorporating a scoop of Mac salad, but instead wanted to charge you extra for a scoop of salad. Really!! When I lived in Hawaii they made it however you wanted it."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Over the last few years, though, the quality and value of the food has dropped off a cliff. Compared to just a year ago, the amount of food per order has been nearly halved with no change in price. Additionally, the meat is bland and dry, with little of the flavor that they used to be well-known for."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii finding good local food in Az can be a challenge, but I gave them 5 stars only because every time the cook sees me, he knows what I want and the cashiers has been pretty nice, they try to be all Aloha even though there haoles but eh they were nice.  I've have several different plates, some impressed me, some didn't but overall, if your hungry they load it up, and that's why I love it!! I love their roast pork with chicken katsu one of my fav. combo.

Update 2016: They started to charge me extra ever since they started having their family members run the cash register.  Example, if I get the bbq mix plate and I don't like meat, I substitute that for chicken and they said okay, but at first I didn't realize they charged me extra to do that, so I was a little irritated that she didn't say nothing. So I went the next following week and ordered the same thing, and I said, are you charging me extra? and she said yes? I said why? I never use to get charged?...So she said, oh it's because you change item we charge extra? I was like umm..but the meat cost more expensive then the chicken? And i've been coming here for years.  I ask to see if the owner was there because he knows what I always order, but new cooking staff now, so disappointed on the service.  Food still good, but now I cut back on eating there, not because of the charge extra, because I felt the customer service was not as par like the previous cashiers."}
{"text":"Whenever i get a craving for some distant memory of a food, and that craving won't go away.... i start whining.  So it was yesterday.  I had been sitting all day with my cravings for real Hawaiian food for what seemed like weeks. I decided to commiserate with a friend who had grown up in Hawaii.  I thought it might make it better.  It was worse.  I started off telling her how i sure could use a big bowl of Saiman for lunch, and didn't laulau and kalua pig sound good? Pretty soon we were both drooling for lomi lomi salmon and manapua.  I was ready to run all the way across town to Mesa.

\"Oh, my friend exclaimed, Why don't you go to L & L?\"

I thought she was kidding.  Sure, I'll grab a flight to Hawaii this afternoon.... 

\"No, There is one at Happy Valley and I-17, across from the Lowes.\"

Needles to say, I spent the rest of the day planning my route home.  I would have to go about 10 miles out of my way, but there wouldn't be traffic.....

L & L doesn't have haoli Hawaiian food, they have REAL Hawaiian food.  I walked in to hear the woman ahead of me order a loco moco plate lunch.  There was a big poster advertising that laulau has only 1 carb, and a paper plate hanging on the service pass through proclaiming \"Linguica special\" in blue magic marker.

This place has it all.  They have Saiman (a Hawaiian version of ramen but the noodles and garnishes are more fun), Musubi (even with spam), manapua (steamed or fried pork roll), haupia (thick coconut cream desert), Poi (pounded taro root), poke (raw tuna seaweed salad), lomi lomi salmon (chopped raw salmon rubbed with chili and onion served with chopped tomatoes), BBQ short ribs, and all other sorts of Hawaiian favorites.

I had a plate lunch.  A traditional plate lunch has a scoop or 2 of rice made with an ice cream scoop, a scoop of macaroni salad made with lots of mayo and Maui onion, and one or 2 main dish items.  Mine were laulau and kalua pig.  Laulau is pork, butterfish and ti leaves with Hawaiian salt, wrapped up in taro leaves and steamed til it can almost melt in your mouth. Kalua pig has to be simulated because the traditional cooking method used to achieve the smokey flavor cannot be approved by the USDA.  Traditional method is a rock lined pit.  The pit is then lined with leaves and the meat (a whole pig) is lowered in then covered with more leaves.  It is then covered to keep the heat in.  I have no idea how they do it, but there is probably smoke flavoring, Hawaiian salt, and a large amount of ti leaves involved.  The Kalua Pig is delicious.

I loved every morsel, and today I have a little leftover vacation to the islands waiting for me at lunch time."}
{"text":"I'm always down for some Spam musubi which I usally get when I come into L&L.  This latest visit was no exception.  

This was my first visit to the location on South Boulder Highway.  It is a smaller restaurant with not many table and not much room.  It was kind of crowded on a Saturday afternoon.  Luckily I beat the crowd and had my order before the biggest group of 6 even placed theirs.  I ordered, as mentioned, my customary Spam musubi and a katsu chicken bowl.  The musubi was quite good with a nice slice of Spam, sufficient sauce and the nori wrap was perfectly tender and not too tough.  The katsu bowl was just alright.  The katsu was was perfect and crispy the way it should be.  The broccoli was over cooked and the rice seemed to be headed that way too.  There was katsu sauce on the table but it seemed a bit thin.  It tasted fine and went well on the katsu and rice.  With a little bit of added Sriracha I had a full flavored dish.  I didn't actually finish my bowl.  I left about half the rice since I had just eaten the musubi.  I didn't feel I needed the extra rice.  It was a bit soft for my liking any how.

This is a small location but it is very clean and colorful.  The inside looks new despite the aging exterior of the building which it occupies.  I may come back here again though there are closer Hawaiian places.  This one happens to be near to the Smith's Grocery I shop at.  It makes it a worth while and convenient stop so I don't have to shop on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"The girls at the counter are very kind and helpful. I got the chicken Katsu and spam musubi, it's about $ 11.50. The portion of the food is plenty, And they are also give free drinks and malasadas"}
{"text":"Worst I've ever ate served salad no dressing. Lettuce tasted bad. Sauce was like water. Shrimp and salmon small portions. Won't be back."}
{"text":"(Keep in mind there are few choices for Hawaiian style fast food in AZ so this might influence my review).

I love going here when I have a craving for Hawaiian food. I usually order the BBQ mix plater composed of beef, chicken and short ribs. I also love their macaroni salad. The portions here are quite large; I usally eat half the plate and save the rest for later.

The people at this location are very friendly and the food is prepared quickly. I would recommend this place if you are tired of eating at the burger/Mexican chains around Phoenix."}
{"text":"We are regular customers at all L&L locations both in California and Arizona. We've never been treated poorly until we visited the L&L off of happy valley. My husband and I walked in to a packed house and only one cashier. We were in the middle of ordering when the cashier answers her personal phone and continues a conversation for a minute or so. My husband goes to pay when he's given no other option but to tip. Are you serious?! I've never been to an L&L where I had to tip. Usually they have the jars you can voluntarily put some change in. After finding a seat we waited for our food to arrive but it never did. He had to work his way through a crowed line to get our food. Overall experience is horrible. We will not be returning. I'd rather drive 25 minutes to Ono Hawaiian BBQ!!"}
{"text":"For me this place is truly just ok.  I work nearby and my bosses bring this stuff in on occasion.  The chicken and the macaroni salad are both pretty great but I just never find myself having a hankering for this stuff.  I've still yet to drive by here on the way home and find the compunction to stop and pick some up.

If you haven't tried it I say go for it, there are far worse places to eat in this shopping center."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and ordered the BBQ Combo I think?
They do not accept American Express which was disappointing.
The food came out fast, but all in all I wasn't impressed. The meat was okay but I honestly just didn't take to it. It had a chewy texture and it was SUPER greasy. 
I've been to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ and enjoyed that much more. I would definitely go there over this place."}
{"text":"Decent food, which tickled the palette enough for you to want to go back. Food portions are good value for money. If you're trying to eat healthy portions, order the mini with one scoop of rice & one scoop of macaroni instead of the two scoops in the regular sized meal.  I had the BBQ chicken and it was very good... except... don't expect prime meat, this fast food joint will supply you with 'nicely' flavored dark meat!!"}
{"text":"The food is still good but the last couple times I've been there, the service has kind of lacked.  For an example, the most recent time I went there, the person working the register had a horrible time communicating with us and had no idea how to work the register.  I mean, I understand training for a new person, but when I make a change from the standard (going from 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of mac, to 2 mac/1 rice) that isn't that difficult, the employee shouldn't stand there looking at the register for a few minutes without asking someone for assistance.  Then the person I was with got the wrong thing based on the person's inability to communicate.  Luckily, he's not picky so it was fine...but still a minor annoyance. Anywho, like I mentioned above, the food is still good, so I'll still go there of course!"}
{"text":"This place use to be so good. Now its okay. Cleanliness has gone way down as well as quality of food."}
{"text":"1 star for this location! We're regular customer to 
L & L and was trying out this location since it just opened and is closer to us. Order the short rib plate and the ribs were horrible! It was like eating warm jerky. The meat was hours old and was rewarmed horrible! Husband ordered laulau & kahlua pork. The laulau was the worse we've ever eaten. Everything just tasted like it was made yesterday and all microwaved to serve minutes after we ordered. 
We'll continue to eat L&L just not from this location!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch and ordered the grilled mahi, but received the fried version. I specifically asked to substitute the brown rice for white rice, which the grilled comes with, but she didn't clarify. At first she was nice, but after their gaffe, her demeanor turned and she didn't even give me utensils or napkins until I asked repeatedly. To make it worse, she went to the kitchen, and the guy ended up giving me the fried fish even though he said it was grilled, which it clearly wasn't. :("}
{"text":"If this review was just on the food, it would be good, however, there is more to going out to eat than the taste of the food! We we ordered our food and 15min went by with nothing, people were coming and going some with larger orders. While I sat waiting, a gentleman went to refill his water cup, with water. A worker, I believe it was the owner, started giving him a hard time about not paying for a drink as if he was gonna get a soda or something when he was clearly eating there and refilling his water cup with ONLY water. Finally, the hubby went up to the counter to ask about our order and found out, they had lost it! There were 3 people standing in the kitchen talking and no one was aware we were still waiting. To top it off, there was an entire table of people that were clearly family of the employees that were running in and out of the kitchen. There are a few other choices of locations for Hawaiian BBQ, I'd recommend trying another place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Owner was a dick. Nothing overt just indifferent. As long as you set your customer service expectations very low you should be good."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 meals to go the cashier was rude and asked for tip during checkout process .. Very stingy with there sauce I asked for Katsu sauce and was given 1 sauce and told no for a second sauce, also teriyaki sauce is completely water down and served in a sriracha sauce bottle will not go back to this location..."}
{"text":"Everything I had an L&L was good, especially their barbecue chicken. Service was friendly and fast if you have never tried Hawaiian barbecue this would be a great place to start"}
{"text":"I love this place! I just get the BBQ Chicken plate every time. Haven't really ventured to new items because I don't need too!!!"}
{"text":"We've been frequenting this L&L on and off for the past five or six years since we moved to the valley, and like many others have witnessed (oft in denial) the fall off in quality, quantity, and overall experience. The katsu is still crisp, but the bbq chicken is pre-cooked (and not in the food prep sense but in the possibly leftover-ish kind of way), and the kalbi is a shadow of its former self, with far more gristle, fewer pieces, and fewer rib bones. 
Service is still the same, still greeting customers with an aloha and a smile, but everything else is lacking in this once formerly decent establishment. 
Or to paraphrase Ordell Robbie (from Jackie Brown), \"What happened to you? Your @$$ used to be beautiful.\""}
{"text":"This is my go to Hawaiian BBQ place, lucky enough they are located close by a few places I've lived at. The short ribs are not too fatty like at most Hawaiian BBQ restaurants around town. The macaroni salad is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I dont mind the food at L&Ls, it can be really good if your in the mood for it. Last time i was here, the food must have been sitting out for a while bc it wasnt fresh and the cashier was lacking in social skills."}
{"text":"I had the seafood platter which was supposed to be mahi mahi and shrimp.  Both were frozen, and I really doubt  the fish was even mahi mahi.  My BF had the barbecue mix which he enjoyed.  The kid behind the counter was really obnoxious.  I'll think twice before coming here again."}
{"text":"LnL drive inn??? Say what LnL's... Now for me back at home (Oahu) LnL is the last place you would find me checking in to a LnL drive inn... Too me this place is like a jack in the box, McDonald's and etc! We have so many local dive places to eat at that I always refuse to go unless it's the last resort!

But, since I'm here in Arizona finding something similar to what I'm normally accustom eating to is super duper hard to find. Even though places here offer teriyaki chicken, bbq meat and etc it's just not the same. All my friends n family says \"Millie it's not home you just have to cook your own local food!\" Okay, I've finally come to that realization but, there's a huge but in this.. Lol

This LnL is by far the closest place to having some kind of island flavor! Granted it's not exactly the same but, it's the closest too having some onolicous Mac salad, rice is on point, and their meals is just what I need to survive! lol and their always super nice!

It's nice looking at the menu and seeing laulau n Kalua pig combo, manapua, poke (it's not Poki it's spelt POKE), spam - Portuguese sausage- eggs & rice, curry katsu and etc! My happy spot in the happy valley area! Love love love this place! Thank you LnL for being here and having some island Flavors"}
{"text":"OMG....you know those bomb lil donuts w sugar on them you get at Chinese buffets? They make them here! So long Chinese buffet waste of money! I can get these heavenly little fried dough balls here! And they are fresh...and bomb"}
{"text":"We have not been here for awhile but were in the mood for L&L this evening.  I usually get the garlic shrimp and broccoli which I tried again tonight, along with a side of their mac salad.  We also got the shrimp curry with rice.  The shrimp in both entrees was the same, the difference was what they put on top.  In the past the shrimp (plenty of them) were stir dried with the garlic and the broccoli all at once and was very tasty.  Tonight we got the shrimp which was breaded (not my liking) with barely cooked garlic spooned on top.  The broccoli was steamed I guess and sitting on the side where the garlic never touched it.  This was a big let down!  I really wanted that shrimpy-garlicy-broccoli goodness we used to get at L&L.

As for the curry it smelled like curry.  The shrimp the same battered and fried as in the meal described previously but the curry just poured on top.  It was OK tasting?  But not our idea of curry and it was rather bland.  

As for the mac salad, the noodles were mooshy and the taste bland.  Something has changed in how they make it, clearly not the mac-salad we have come to know and like at L&L.

We did not get our other usuals but based on the two we got tonight I am a bit hesitant to go back.  I  suppose we will give them a go again and order the chicken instead.  

We have liked L&L over the past 12 years or so that we have been going, tonight was a disappointment tho.  It is till nice and clean inside, and the wait staff friendly so that has not changed.  I feel bad giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place, consistent no matter where you get it, and a lot of copy cat restaurants that can't match the quality. I'm Chamorro (Guamanian), so this is the closest food I can get to my island food, and it always hits the spot. A bit expensive, but sure beats fast food!"}
{"text":"Im not sure what the guys deal is that works the counter. But hes a dick. Hes older, possibly the manager or owner. 

Came here on two separate times. I guess I thought the first time he was in a bad mood? It happens, no one likes working in the food industry and maybe he was stressed out. 

But I noticed he gave myself and my boyfriend (whos white) rude treatment. Then a full Asian guy walks in after us and the guy working the counter was all smiles to him and courteous. Okay, maybe he comes in alot? Not sure. Anyway. 

I was curious if they happend to have white meat, and would be nore than happy to pay extra if they did. So I politely asked if they happen to have white meat. The guy rudely says no. 

Then as I waited for my order, a white guy comes in and places an order, cold treatment again. 

I figured maybe hes having an off day, whatever, the food is alright, so no big deal. 

I asked my boyfriend last night to stop by here and pick me up something. The same guy was a dick, AGAIN. We are never rude to any employee anywhere, cause we have both worked in the food industry and retail. Doing that type of work can be sucky. And my boyfriend is the nicest guy youll ever meet. 

My boyfriend asked them if they had any chopsticks, the guy scoffs and says no then turns around and ignores my boyfriend.

I think that visit will be our last. Not sure if we can handle such awful customer service when the prices here are so high."}
{"text":"Been coming here since July 1 2016 and the quality is awesome. Great service with good portions of food. I consider myself a regular now due the fact that I come 3 days out of week minimum."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is close to home...but my experience wasn't the best. I ordered the chicken katsu (small portion and it is plenty!) and the spam musubi. The musubi did not look like the picture at all. Mine was completely covered in nori and had so much rice I was almost completely full with this. The flavor was ok...but something I would def not order again. 

The chicken katsu was crunchy which I liked...and the macaroni salad was creamy. The only thing is that I thought it was a bit bland. The chicken just tasted like something fried and the macaroni salad needed some salt. 

Overall the price is good. The quantity is good too...but the flavor is not there for me. I would not go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"They make you enter a tip amount for orders and the lowest option is 15%. Awful awful business. Everything you order will cost 15% more than what the menu says."}
{"text":"I normally order their 1/2 and 1/2 combo which had cabbage, rice, macaroni salad and choice of two meats. I always choose the katsu chicken and BBQ chicken and is delicious. 
Today I opted for the seafood combo which us mahi mahi, 3 fried shrimp and a choice of other meat. I chose BBQ short ribs.  The short ribs were excellent.  The mahi-mahi was a flat thin fillet heavily battered and no flavor.  though it was tender, there was no flavor. The fried shrimp only had their crunchy batter as a positive.. they were thin and bland.  Definitely won't be trying those next time, but altogether I still love L&L and if nothing else will stick with my 'regular' 1/2 and 1/2.."}
{"text":"When I'm craving a good plate-lunch, this is where I end up. Curry Chicken Katsu is my go-to item.  

Their portions are very large, so the mini is always plenty of food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for ono (delicious) food in the north valley, this is the spot! We have been coming here for years to enjoy authentic plate lunch on our way to and from Phoenix (we live in Northern AZ). Try the kalua pork and beef short ribs served with awesome Hawaiian mac salad!  They also have some of the friendliest staff in AZ!"}
{"text":"S'okay.  A bit expensive and not authentic.

Hit L&L with the fam and left missing shops back in the islands even more.

BBQ plate was good enough.  The meat wasn't too fatty, and the rice and mac salad were good.  Hawaiian Sun Passion Orange drinks were expensive, though.  My wife had the chicken katsu and kalua pork, which she didn't enjoy.  Pork was dry and too salty while the katsu chicken meat was fatty and had some extra gristle for our pleasure.  

My 6 year-old had the saimin with chicken and egg.  She picked at it as it was bland and the egg yolk was a tad raw.  Overall, it is nothing like back home in Hawai'i.  The boba tea she had was a drink with ice and the tapioca was old/deteriorating.  I've never seen her stop drinking a boba tea, before.  

Bathroom was a wreck.  More than anything, it turned me off eating.  L&Ls used to be so dependable for good Hawaiian food.  So hit-and-miss these days."}
{"text":"This place is discussing.. I had a drink and I finished it.. when I went to eat the ice. There is a black thing frozen inside the ice.. I called the place to let them know and the girl that answered said it's ok.. just Don't eat the ice.. WTF??? Really.. they know the machine is making black things and she said that they have no control over it.. that is plain nasty.. never again will I eat here."}
{"text":"Forget about even coming here - they're so damn rude! I just called to place an order for pick up and and he replied, \"What are you gonna order?\" Like, who says that?! So I said \"Forget it, you're rude.\"  Going to Ono"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ place I've eaten at!  The staff very friendly and the place was clean.  I will return!"}
{"text":"This place, to me, is just like Aloha Eats in Chicago. The menu offers pretty much the same options as Aloha Eats and is also about the same price. My brother recommended this place because my mom was craving some Hawaiian BBQ, and L &L hit the spot. L & L is located in a row of fast food places - think mall food court within a shopping center. What -- you can't decide what to eat and are in the area? Uh, no problem. 

My mom and I shared the BBQ mix plate. I wasn't too crazy about the chicken, the beef was pretty tender and tasty. I was a little disappointed to see that the mix plate only offers one slice (?) of the short rib, which my mom loved. My dad enjoyed his Atkins version of the BBQ beef, but he loved the mahi mahi mini plate he had on our second visit to L & L. Yeah, I said second visit .... second visit in 4 days. It's pretty much on our \"to-eat\" places the next time we are Phoenix."}
{"text":"Can't say we ate here in HI, but we do go to L&Ls in SoCal and this place is just as good.  My boys love it and so do I.  

Good sized portions mean you never leave hungry.  The Katsu sauce is great and I ladle it over just about everything.  I wish I could buy some to have around the house.

Kind of unusual menu.  Macaroni salad as a ubiquitous side dish, for example.  But perhaps that is the Hawaiian way.

Doesn't get five stars because the food seems a little bland to me - hence my putting the Katsu sauce on everything.  Maybe that's the style though so don't let that one missing star stop you from giving it a try!  Unlike a prior reviewer I have never had food quality problems here.  Rice has always been perfect.  And I have eaten here many times."}
{"text":"The only location in Arizona! :(

Let me begin with how completely STOKED I am to find out that there's an L&L right next to my place! Score!

I used to frequent the one in Oregon when I lived there, so this was a total treat. Went here at 6:30 on a friday & parking was hectic in the area, but its also rush hour. I was able to walk right up to the counter & place my order, the clerk was friendly & service was fast.

I ordered Loco Moco, because from my experience, there aren't too many places in AZ that serve it for whatever reason. Eggs were made exactly how I ordered & portion of food was great (I got regular size, but you can order a mini).

I will definitely be back & bring the hubs!"}
{"text":"Aweful food, probably worst meat I ever had. They should make the portions smaller (it really was a lot) but buy better meat instead. The second star is because the place was clean the guys were very friendly. Do not go there."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this location, fast and friendly service with the food fresh and cooked to order. I had the garlic chicken plate today, so good!  The chicken is crisp and the sauce has a great flavor. I really enjoy this Mac salad and the portions are always generous."}
{"text":"Went in today because I had been wanting to try it. The girl working the counter was very nice and helpful. The food was pretty forgettable and the shrimp was pretty fishy. Doubt I'll be back but the food wasn't awful."}
{"text":"Had the curry chicken...found it to be a bit bland,  Would come back and try again, this time trying something that isn't breaded."}
{"text":"I was greeted with an Aloha!  This review is based on a single visit.  I asked \"What is your best recommendation?\".  I went with their 2nd choice - Chicken Katsu.  It was just ok, honestly I really didn't care for it.  It was a lot of food though.  2 scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad with it (neither was very good).  Food is served in a styrofoam to-go go plate.  I didn't care much for anything about the overall experience eating in - other than the Aloha."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. The plates come with two big scoops of nice fluffy rice and some yummy macaroni salad. For my trip I tried the BBQ chicken and it was tender and overall great!"}
{"text":"Place was cleaner and cashier was very nice. This to me is a corporate owned Hawaiian BBQ place, when in Hawaii would go to local spots so sadly this place can't compare. 

Food; Got the Combo with Chicken Katie and Short Ribs, the chicken was not white meat so didn't eat it, the short ribs were actually tasty. The macaroni salad was very good."}
{"text":"Today our boss took our department out for lunch at l&l. There are many great looking items on the menu I had a hard time choosing. There was however one that stuck out from a triple d episode. I ordered the loco moco and it was darn good. It's a bed of rice with a ground beef patty on top with 2 over easy eggs and gravy above that. On first bite you pop the egg open over the meat and rice and just get this layered goodness. It was a great lunch. I totally want to go back to try their other items but at least this one was great."}
{"text":"I've been going to L&L for years. Started off in California but have frequented this location for the past two years. Whenever I have a craving for chicken, this is where I go. I love their teriyaki chicken and rice. Their pasta salad is the best thing ever!"}
{"text":"Our family frequents this location often. Based on food quality / portions / atmosphere and service, this place is a solid 4/5. It is very good. 

Our go-to is the barbeque chicken plate and/or katsu chicken plate, which includes rice, cabbage and macaroni salad. We usually add a spam musabi or two. The portions are super gorgeous and tasty.  

The restaurant itself is clean and the staff is always friendly. 

Wait times whether eating in or taking out are about 10 minutes, which is very fair considering food quality.

My only gripe (and I know it's nitpicking): if paying by credit/debit, their system all but forces you to tip a minimum if 15%. That's fine for a full service restaurant, but seems excessive for a self serve / quick serve place.

Sure, you can select a \"no tip\" option, but it's not a default so it feels like you're \"stiffing\" them as the staff looks on. 

For our family of 4, a meal costs us just over $50 after 15% tip. 

So a solid 4/5 after giving consideration to price/value."}
{"text":"For being one of the only decent restaurants in the area I really enjoy L&L. Everyone is always so nice and the restaurant is always clean. I am able to call in and pick up my order as well. The man and I usually stick to what we know; Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu all rice no mac salad. I have actually had their mac salad and it basically tasted like mayonnaise which I am not a big fan of.  If you are looking for decent affordable Hawaiian food this place isn't bad."}
{"text":"Like many reviewers I am from Oahu and have eaten at crap shack L&Ls in Waimanalo and fancier ones catering to haole tourists. This is a great spot. Of course things are a a bit different. We're on the mainland so there isn't the beach breeze or pigeon talk to make you feel at home. It's still great food and they have some extras like manapua (almost as good as from the manapua truck) and poke."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time in years.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best in town.  I got the Katsu and the ribs while my wife got the katsu and beef.  We both agreed that the katsu was decent but more breeding than chicken.  And with the beef and the ribs they were pretty salty.  They were tasty and tende but seemed salty.  Not sure if it just my taste or maybe the teriyaki sauce it was marinated in.  Only real bad thing was the mac salad. It was just mainly mac and mayo. Not much to it and a little bland."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay.  Cashier was extra friendly, which was nice.  I like the Hawaiian decor, with pics of the ocean and beach on the walls.  But it's still in a strip mall so don't get too excited. Chicken was tender and flavorful, and the little mini macoroni salad was a nice added touch. It could be priced a little cheaper for what it is, but still, it's not bad.  I haven't been to Hawaii in a while, but based on other reviews, I would say it is pretty authentic."}
{"text":"Food here is fast and tasty and cheap! Ive been coming to L&L Hawaii barbecue for over 10 years and was very happy when one opened up in North Las Vegas. Located in the same shopping complete as the Smith Grocery Store, L&Ls offers a wide variety of Hawaiian comfort food like chicken katsu, fried mahi mahi, bbq chicken, and bbq short ribs. They even have cheeseburger and fries (never tried). The food here is affordable and incredibly good. I got the chicken katsu mini ($6.50) and the portion size is perfect for me for lunch or dinner. The regular size portion is only $2 more but I have trouble finishing the mini in 1 sitting. The chicken katsu is crispy and juicy. You have to eat it with the katsu sauce. It comes with a side of macaroni salad (I don't like mayo but enjoyed the salad) and a scoop of rice. Overall this restaurant is new and a little small, but the food here is great at an affordable price. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We  stop by here and try their bbq mix. That's the most popular one.  It's taste \"ONO\"!!The meat cooked very well!We must come back"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the customer services absolutely sucks. There is always a kid behind the counter that is a smart ass. And for some odd reason they believe they should receive a tip from you even though the whole transacts completed at the counter, no table waiting service.  Like I said the good is good but the lack of good services makes you not want to return."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have been exploring the many many lunch options on a daily (oops) basis. That reminds me I really need to pack my lunch...but I can't make Hawaiian food! Quite the dilemma. 

Back to the topic at hand...stopped in here yetserday to grab lunch to go and let the smells of awesomeness make my coworkers jealous while I scarfed it up at my desk. The portion is huge and the food came out hot, fresh and delicious. 

The stars get deducted for the weird way they make you pay with a card. Its a chipped card so you have to put it in the machine, that's fine...but then she asks you to select a tip and your options are 15%, 20% or higher. I'm sorry, but I'm here to pickup food to go, maybe i'll leave a buck or 2 if I'm feeling it and its fast and awesome, but the pressure to tip is really obnoxious. She told me, you can hit \"0\" to leave nothing and then stood over me while I did it. No thanks, at restaurants they don't hover while you fill out a receipt and there should be a \"no tip\" choice because that's common sense at a take-out place. Won't be back for that experience unless I have cash on hand."}
{"text":"Located in the Smith's mall near Johnny Mac's. The typical L&L, with a nice variety of specials and mix of Hawaiian foods. I like they have a smaller lunch sized portion of the normal mixed plates. 

I've had a teriyaki salmon bowl, a mixed plate of kalbi, beef, and teriyaki chicken. All were good. What separates this location is the happy girl behind the cash register....really nice and fun! Attitude is important. Food servers should all take notice. A smile goes a long ways.

I'll be back, it's convenient for lunch."}
{"text":"By far, THE BEST HAWAIIAN BBQ. I would make the far drive from tucson for this place. Everything made and cooked perfectly. Perfectly seasoned. Great prices. The best thing of all, that sets this place from the rest......MACARONI SALAD. What's in there? Macaroni. Why its so good? IDK it just is. TRY IT!!!!

My order: Half and half kalbi and chicken katsu plus an order of spam musubi."}
{"text":"It's nice to visit an establishment that seems to care about the customer and quality of food they deliver.  I've been going to this location for many years and finally thought, \"Hey!  I should write a review\"!  Anyway, I usually get the bbq chicken dinner and I'm always satisfied with the flavor and quantity.  The staff is always pleasant and helpful.  Great place for a change of pace from the usual fast food fare!"}
{"text":"A few years ago I got food poisoning here.  Maricopa County Health Inspectors verified some critical/serious violations. Since they've resolved those, I returned (after many years) to give it another try (which is hard to once you get food poisoning from something or somewhere).

But, this time all was well. I have been there many times since and am glad to not get sick anymore.  That was not a fun sick experience.

the happy, tall girl that worked the counter was pleasant and friendly.  The last time I went there though she wasn't there."}
{"text":"Go here and get the green curry beef. Shh...don't ruin this, just do it. You'll be thanking me in your mind."}
{"text":"i have been coming here for years and i still love their hawaiian bbq chicken! i love the fact that they also offer combo meals for affordable price. the only thing that gets me here though is that you really have to check that they have made your order right."}
{"text":"I went to L&L's bc we dont have these on the east coast. But the ones on the islands are better but I had to have my fix while in Phoenix.

I got the Moco Loco which was great, but for the price, I think I could have gotten better."}
{"text":"I LOVE L&L. The saltiness of the kalua pork against the creaminess of the macaroni salad - it is soooo worth the calories. The BBQ chicken and chicken katsu are my second favorites. I have had other hawaiian BBQ in the area and this is hands down the best around metro Phoenix. The staff are super friendly, the prices are low and the place is always clean."}
