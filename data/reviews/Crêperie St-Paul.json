{"text":"The salad dressing on the salad which came with the crepe was wonderful. The cappuccino was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Best crepes we had on our visit from Dallas, TX. Most of the other creperies we went to focused on presentation; Creperie St. Paul was all about the taste. Silky smooth, and cooked to perfection the egg and cheese crepe and cappuccino hit the spot.  We went early and avoided the crowds (pretty much had the place to ourselves). The staff was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"In the middle of  2018 hard winter, maybe it'll be nice to go to old Montreal ( even if it's not summer!). 

Me and my lady we choose to have a coffee and maybe something good to warmed our hearts. So we stop by La crêperie St-Paul, the coffee is delicious and the crêpes ; ) excellents ! 

The coffee is one of the best in Montreal i ever taste, and even though i didn't have a sweet tooth ( unlike my lady Lol) i love the banana maple syrup crêpe and  she liked her chocolate/banana crêpe mucho Lol

A bit costy but sometimes it's good !


en plein milieu de du dur hiver 2018, c'est agréable d'aller marcher dans le vieux port ( même si ce n'est pas l'été c'est cool).

Moi et ma dame sommes entré afin de réchauffer nos coeurs avec un bon café.
Nous sommes arrêtés à la crêperie St-Paul ou le café est délicieux et la crêpe excellente ; )


C'est un des meilleur café que j'ai dégusté à Montréal, et même si je n'ai pas la dent sucrée ( contrairement à ma blonde Lol) j'i bien aimé ma crêpe sirop d'érable/banana et elle a bien aimée sa crêpe banane/chocolat !


Un peu cher mais parfois c'est bon !"}
{"text":"Our crepe was tasty. Not Paris tasty,  but much easier to get too and it is hard to compete with a crepe made on a boat docked on the Seine River. That said, the strawberries and bananas were fresh and flavorful, and the Nutella plentiful."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Friday night. The wait service was terrific, and the chefs were fabulous. The music is from Senegal -- I loved it! 
The food was perfect -- not too heavy, lovely cheeses, fresh veggies.
We split a lemon crepe for dessert -- formidable!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes! No lines and fast service for lunch on a Saturday. Cute trendy vintage interior."}
{"text":"Stopped in this weekend for breakfast and really enjoyed it. Could not resist and had to order the crepe with Nutella, Strawberries and Bananas. It was delicious and very filling!  Also enjoyed a lovely latte. 

The only thing that I did not like about this place was the confusion with the hours. On a freezing Saturday morning at 915 am, we walked into the establishment and were told by the chef that they did not open until 10 (proceeded to lock the door). They may want ensure they are communicating the right open/closing times before booting out paying customers. I checked google, Facebook and yelp (obviously) and not one place shows a later opening than 9am."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Old Montreal. Great brew, awesome crepes, ambience is chill, they even play good tunes. Look for Sami. Great service."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic place for crêpes! We came as a family, and were welcomed by great service and amazing food. I had the salmon and cream cheese crêpe which was great. My kids had the nutella and the white chocolate crêpes, which they loved as well. The only negative was the latte, which came from a machine and was watery. However, when we complained about it to the waitress, she not only made it free, but also gave us one of our crêpes for free! That was amazing service! (we tipped generously)

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great surprise! My first choice was closed and this place was recommended by an owner of a local store. Simply excellent."}
