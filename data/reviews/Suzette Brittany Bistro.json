{"text":"Charming and delicious! From start to finish, we had great service and a memorable experience. The ambiance, decor, and staff take us back to our trip to France. Pierre, our French waiter, was attentive and experienced. Our group ordered a number of galettes and entrees, including the Suzette Burger and the Cowboy and Paysanne galettes. Those who had the burger thoroughly enjoyed it with the house-made ketchup and aioli sauce. As for the galettes, the Cowboy was a savoury hit while the Paysanne felt overly seasoned and a tad dry. When ordering the Paysanne, the waiter suggested that I add gruyere cheese for a creamier texture, which I did. However, when I tasted the Paysanne, we had to double check to confirm whether gruyere was even added at all since it was not noticeable.  For dessert, our table shared three items: the île Flottante, Normande crepe, and another crepe featuring a poached pear whose name I've just forgotten. All were delicious, with the most memorable being the île Flottante.   Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant and will return to try other galettes and menu items."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place we stumbled upon tonight. Very tasty, and very reasonably priced. Super cosy environment, too, and great service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly greeting at the door but service from our waitress was at times mediocre. Asked for a taste of a pinot noir before ordering it and she poured me a glass of it and when i reminded her about the taster she seemed to have poured me a taster out of the glass she had originally poured. Also forgot a few things during our dinner but could be just having a bad day. The good thing is that there was another waitress there to help.  Between the two of us, we ordered a salad, a burger, the fish of the day and a crepe to share. All but the fish was good. The fish which was cod, was basically a steamed filet on a few vegetables. It did not come with anything else on the side. For the price, the portion could have been bigger or it could have been served with something else."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing. My fella took me here for our anniversary, and it was just lovely. The ambiance was beautiful - it's very white, open and clean - and the service was great. For my fancier meals, I do enjoy a server who is polite and helpful without being all over you. My fella had the Suzette burger, which was very decadent. He loved the comte and the home made ketchup. I had the Poulet Chasseur and was so, so, so impressed. It was pretty much exactly what I wanted. Tender, cooked perfectly, and so tasty. For dessert, we split the Nutella crepe. It was perfection. Nutella crepes are my favorite - so simple, and so delicious. Their crepe batter is so light and beautiful. I highly recommend Suzette!"}
{"text":"Oh my word! This place is DELICIOUS! Came for lunch with a friend. Made a reservation and got a great table near the window. Though the place was busy we got our food quickly.  We both had the bacon, mushroom, and potato galette and it was out of this world delicious. The crepe was made perfectly.If you don't like rich French food this particular crepe may not be for you. It had tons of bacon and was a decent size. Not light at all. It was perfect for what we wanted though. I will definitely have it again.  The person that sat us at our table was very friendly. The space is lovely. White with beautiful accents. This restaurant did an awesome job of creating a French bistro atmosphere. Our server was equally friendly. Answered all our questions about the menu and was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had an early meal with a friend on the second night Suzette was open. We were greeting by not one, not two, but three friendly ladies within three minutes  of having been at our table. The offered us still or bubbly water and brought us some baguette with herbed butter. Our main server suggested the galettes. The menu is small and focuses mainly on these buckwheat crepes (gluten free)  that is a staple of the Brittany area of France where the chef is from. They come with different fillings, along with a small side salad. We each throughly enjoyed our crepes.                They were lightweight and generously stuffed with ingredients. We had the French version of a dark and stormy. Our drinks were stiff but refreshing, and for dessert we shared. . . well another crepe of course. It came with apples, Spanish brandy sauce and ice cream. I could have had three of them myself, they were so simple but delicious. Not overly sweet either.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they will be serving for brunch in the future!"}
{"text":"A really good French \"creperie\" where you find both galettes (main meal) and crepes (dessert). They also have other options like steaks and pasta, which is really unusual for a creperie but it gives options for those who don't like galettes & crepes. The food is tasty. We had a Complete (very traditional) and a Norvegienne (I prefer when there is no leek in there, but it's just a personal taste). The cider was very good too. My only disappointment was the Nutella which is made with Papa Chocolat hazelnut chocolate spread; it would be so much better with a traditional chocolate sauce (as used for other crepes). The Bretonne with caramel salted butter is excellent. The service is great, with nice and attentive staff. I liked the Breton décor and the natural light.  It reminds me of France. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service.... And beware of Brettone Crepe, don't be shy, but just lick that caramel sauce."}
{"text":"What is not to like about this sweet and rustic bistro of pure deliciousness? The ambience and friendly staff is down to earth and unpretentiously attentive. After a long hard week of guts and glory brainwork, this place is my little haven of sanity and TLC, reviving me dish after delightful dish with perfectly seasoned and simply sophisticated French favorites...each giving me back a piece after piece of my spirit and adventurousness that got overwhelmed with the tyrannical demands of the unwieldy. Must return, must refresh, must get back to more of this yummy uber delicious homemade Nutella crepe and Suzette tagliatelle drenched in bacon and Creme the staff gave me a baguette to soak it all in...and washed down with the perfect petite French martini that makes the weekend seem like it already began the minute my tush hit the cush by the bar of Suzette Bistro  years ago..."}
{"text":"Traditional French bistro food. We tried the Galettes. Fresh ingredients. Nice plating. Super friendly and informative French server. Cute nautical decor. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Food:  We chose to eat the regional specialties - savoury buckwheat crepes called galettes and cider cocktails.  The galettes were delicious. I tried the Moroccan and the mergeuz sausage in the filling was perfect. Portions are large. We finished with dessert crepes.  Service:  Good.   Atmosphere: Very 'french' with tables close together, open windows to the street (summer), and knowledgeable wait staff.  There seemed to be an extraordinary number of exceptionally beautiful women there the night we went.  Question:  Why so few starter options? We wanted to have some appetizers to share and nibble, but the menu lacks options.  Summary:  A great option for a night out with friends or a date night. Good food, good service and good location. If you don't mind walking in from your parking spot."}
{"text":"On a cold and humid spring morning my husband and I decided to try out the very new Suzette Bistro. We easily made a reservation on their website using PriorityTable and showed up an hour later, eager to relive our visit to the north-western coast of France.   The interior of the bistro is bright and airy, with lovely café style chairs set nice and close together to mimic the cafés in France. There are small decorative reminders of the coastal Brittany region scattered throughout the space.  If you are looking for an extensive menu, you may be disappointed but if you are looking for a great selection of galettes and crêpes...well you are definitely in the right place! I think Suzette Bistro is the only place in Calgary where you can find traditional galettes, the crispy, chewy buckwheat savoury 'crêpes'. You can order them with a variety of fillings and yes, they are gluten free if you are into that sort of thing.  Other menu items include: Moules Frites, Steak Frites, the Suzette Hamburger, Fish of the day, and some pasta items including some delicious sounding mac n cheese au gratin. Despite being only the second day open, service was very attentive, though our Chèvre starter order got lost somehow. We were offered a crêpe gratis, thus eliminating our final quandary of having to decide between a crêpe or one of their delicious sounding desserts. We then ordered the Normande because I'm a sucker for Calvados. It came with caramelized apple, flambée au Calvados & vanilla ice cream. Delicious! Then I became slightly jealous of the table next to us when I saw an île flottante float by...amazing! I can't wait to visit Suzette Bistro again. Note: They have a really cute French cocktail list and I am dying to try it out...yet another reason to visit.  Note: They free pour some of that wonderful Brittany cider...it can get pretty expensive at 8$ per glass especially when they do not tell you the price and you absolutely adore it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to fall in love with the place after reading so many positive reviews on Yelp; however, I doubt if I will be coming through their doors again. We were quite ready to order when the waiter told us that he would be back in three minutes; it was over ten minutes before he returned. The galette complète that I ordered came in a bland crêpe that I noticed was typical of all the other main items in this category. Inside was a thin slice of ham on a cheese base. I have had better ham and cheese sandwiches; only after did I notice that the egg that is supposed to accompany the dish was missing. Another person in our party has dietary restrictions, which eliminated most of the menu items as they couldn't be served without the unwanted ingredients. You know how annoying it is when the person living in a neighboring apartment has the music cranked up but all that you hear is just the boom boom boom of the bass and no melody? Well, that is exactly what you find here: the noise is so loud that you can't have a decent conversation. The owner did rush out on the street after we left to ask us how we had enjoyed the experience. I didn't want to cause a fuss on the street but for his sake I do hope that he reads these few remarks."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. You can usually get in on the weekend without waiting."}
{"text":"I first visited here during the Xmas season 2015 and had the dessert crepes I thought it was a cozy spot... service was good. I visited here recently twice with different people and was disgusted by the lack of customer service by one member of their team. I had ordered a salad, which when I received it, I noticed there was something on it that I was allergic to... (there was no mention on the menu, or else I would've ordered something else)... The male server who was \"supposed\" to be taking care of us disappeared for a long time so I finally alerted a female server as to my concern. She looked unimpressed by my concern and took away my plate. I saw her alert the male server who looked over and dismissively walked away. After a long wait, I finally received my order... the female server simply \"dropped it off\" on the table and walked away with not one word or even eye contact?!?!  We found their behaviour quite odd and it was starting to make us upset. NO ONE ever came to check any of us to see how our meals were during the entire visit. The upsetting thing was is that we were watching both the male and female server check on other guests at the restaurant!?! This was very upsetting for us... as we have NEVER experienced this before. What seemed like an eternity,the male server relectantly reared his head and gave us the bill. While we were each paying separatly he didn't bother to say one word to any of us. I was the last to pay and when I was done, he ripped the receipt from the machine, THREW it on the table and walked off!!!?!? We were beyond shocked and in disbelief. Did this actually just happen?!?! As angry as we were, we thought it was best to leave the restaurant since I didn't see anyone who looked like a manager around.  If i left a 1 star, it was because there isn't an option for ZERO stars. The ONLY one good thing I could say is the friendly lady with glasses (hostess) perhaps who greeted and seated us at the table. THAT'S IT! I would never return or recommend this place to anyone! To be treated with such disrespect and lack of customer service for a seemingly upscale place is disgusting. As I was leaving I heard someone call the male server \"Shane\". I guess I would've mentioned him by his name if he even bothered to introduce himself in the beginning. To have the DISPLEASURE of being served by him twice on TWO separate occasions proves that he should really quit his job as it is CLEAR that he hates it! This restaurant needs to better train it's staff to avoid this teenager-highschool cliquey behaviour it exudes!"}
{"text":"Enfin, un vrai bon petit restaurant breton... On se croirait de retour au pays... Un régal !!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, however the crepes didn't meet expectations. Went with 2 other people and we all agreed- the savory crepes were too greasy and 'heavy'. The dessert crepes were delicious (albeit very pricy), drinks were good and Staff was very attentive. Overall, not great value for my money. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I love the Languedoc rosé and the ambience is wonderful! It's walking distance from my home, which makes it easier. Very busy at lunch and dinner, reservations are therefore recommended. Lunch today \"salmon au papillon\" C'est merveilleux !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Calgary. I have been there 6 or 7 times and every time the service is great and the food is consistently amazing. The room is clean modern with a cool vibe. One of the best burgers in Calgary! Very respectful staff make everyone feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Another expensive place......a crepes $$$$ is street food and should not cost more than $5.00 flour and water....Canada let's wake up  we have pancakes for cheap ..."}
{"text":"I have been to Suzette twice for dinner and both times were excellent. The atmosphere is quaint and intimate. The food is very good. On my latest visit I was served by Barbara, who provided outstanding service. I would highly recommend Suzette."}
{"text":"So deliciously amazing and phenomenal. Suzette Bistro tastes just like France! My cousin and I came here for dinner a few weeks ago, and both of us loved it. We have each spent time in France, and this place brought us back to our favorite memories abroad. I had the galette complete for dinner, a Nutella crepe for dessert, and the house white wine. Everything was superb. Our server was the kindest and most attentive ever, and offered great suggestions (not that you could go wrong with anything from the menu). The decor is cool, French but hip, not stuffy. Dinner was definitely amazing, but I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their brunch menu.  Good change over from Bistro 2210 that used to occupy this space, definitely scaled up!"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of good things about Suzette Bistro before going and I was worried that my expectations were too high and I would be disappointed. However, it was amazing.  The decor is charming, the staff is polite and attentive, the food is delicious,and the portions sizes are exactly right.  Highly recommend:  -smoked salmon and leek buckwheat galette -goat's cheese buckwheat galette -any of their coffees -salted butter and caramel crepe -- I could have eaten two of them on my own.   Can't wait to go back and try more of their entrees."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Excellent service and food.  I had the Paysanne galette and the Kir Breton.  Also got fries.  Finished off with the Bretonne crepe for dessert.  The dessert crepe was amazing - I highly recommend the caramel and butter.  I ate it in maybe 2 seconds it was so good.    The food is a bit pricey, but i think the quality of the food is worth it.  I recommend asking the servers for their recommendations as well.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Delish! I have been here twice and it has been a 2/2. First time was for a work lunch and the whole experience was top notch. Once I walked in I was greeted by a friendly man with a nice French accent.  I was shown to my table and asked what water I would prefer. (Sparkling please!) After looking over the menu I decided on a savory crepe with goat cheese and spinach.  It was SO good. It came out with a little salad on the side which was lightly dressed and also amazing. This experience made me suggest for my second visit for brunch with my bestie.  This time was like the first, amazing service from start to finish. We shared two different kinds this time, a savory and sweet. Both were so delicious and filling!  Love this place, love Cassis, and love the French!"}
{"text":"Had my first visit today for brunch with a friend and we both loved it! Loved that they take reservations. Loved that the staff were all French so it really did feel like you were sitting in a French bistro. Loved that it took less than 10 minutes for our food to come out. The crepes were nice and light and weren't overly filled which definitely made the crepe the star of the show. Don't leave without trying one of their sweet crepes, they are to die for! Can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Me and my husband both loved our meals and the cozy feel of the restaurant. Loved that our waitress was French, it just added a lil something to the whole dinning experience. We will be going again. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is cuz they don't offer any changes table in the washrooms. When I needed to change my daughter I needed to leave the restaurant and walk down the block, back to my car to change her in there.  Cuz of that I couldn't go back when its cold out side."}
{"text":"Great experience, friendly service, simple and stylish space, the food was amazing..  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Simply put, Suzette is amazing and there have been weeks where I visit more than once for their amazing crepes."}
{"text":"We decided to try something a little different back when the Big Taste was on in Calgary, and we came upon this French bistro on 4th street for crepes!  It was a great experience - delicious food and good ambience.  Atmosphere:  4/5  This was a small, cozy, charming French bistro located on 4th street... simple but quaint.  It was starting to get busy when we arrived and parking can be difficult to find around the area, but it was definitely worth the wait!  Food: 4/5  We had the Big Taste menu which included a squash soup, a Galette (gluten free) complete - ham, egg and cheese for the main course, and crepe bretonne - caramel salted butter for dessert.  The soup was big, rich and quite filling.  I liked the lunch buckwheat crepe which was light with crunchy edges.  The dessert crepe was good too but maybe a little too sweet and at that point too much food for me!  Overall great.  Service: 4/5  Simple, quick, and friendly service.  Price: 3.5/5  Reasonable and good price for the Big Taste.  Overall: 4/5  I really enjoyed the ambience of this cozy French restaurant and their delicious crepes.  I will definitely return to try some of their other crepes but will probably only order one as it did get quite filling at the end."}
{"text":"My partner and I traveled to Calgary for business and after reading reviews, looked forward to eating at Suzette Brittany Bistro.  We took a taxi there as our hotel was a good distance and then sat down to order.  Due to my having numerous medical food allergies, I requested a Galette with only cheese and mushrooms as all others contained at least one ingredient that was contrary to my dietary restrictions.  I explained this to the kind food server and she went to ask the chef.  She returned to tell me the chef refused as he is rigid about changing his recipes.  I expressed again that I had these allergies and dietary restrictions and that they could charge whatever they wanted but the only ingredients that would affect me neutrally were those I mentioned.  The food server told us she was sorry, it doesn't matter.  We left without ordering.  I then emailed the following letter to management but in several days, have received no response from anyone:  Dear management,  We came to your restaurant today to eat.  We were very excited to try your cuisine but ended up leaving because the chef refused to make a Galette with only mushrooms and cheese.  I have medical dietary restrictions and there was no menu item that would have been acceptable for me and although I offered to pay whatever it would take, my request was refused, even after explaining my dietary restrictions.  I feel this was unfair and also difficult to understand.  Thank you, Alice D. (Phone number provided)"}
{"text":"Fantastic first dining experience here at Suzette Brittany Bistro.  Very impressed with only being open less than 2 weeks!  Well done Giles.  Upon arrival, we all sampled the Brittany \"tea\" cider while we waited for our table to reset. Five of us dined late last night with an 8pm reservation.  Had one of the comfy booth tables upstairs which was well worth the wait!  As we sat down, the table next to us was just leaving, so I asked what they had, and how things were.  They were all raving about their meals especially the fish of the day and the ravioli.  So we knew that we were going to order that without a doubt. We let Giles and our server select other things to try amongst the five of us.  Had two salads which were both well balanced in portion and flavour profile.  Two savoury gallettes were next.  A few of us at the table weren't sure about getting them, but were pleasantly surprised with them. The first was a mushroom one and second was merquez lamb.  Both excellent.  For our mains we shared the fish of the day, chicken and ravioli.  All were excellent.  Wine list also offered a wide selection of choices.  Highly recommend and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very good crepes! Ordered the scallop galette, scallop was on the small side, but cooked perfectly. Leeks and mushrooms were cooked very well, especially the leeks! In order to like galettes you have to like buckwheat so if you aren't sure then go ahead and ask for it to be made with a traditional crepe. We also ordered the potato and leek soup, ok, not bad not great, could have used a little more flavor. My dad disagrees and said it was very good.   We also ordered the banana and chocolate crepe. Good, but not the best I've ever had.   Good atmosphere. Elegant, quiet, and friendly staff that's attentive.   Ladies lunch hang out. Good spot for a date night, or ladies dinner.   Reservations recommended. Don't sit by the door if you get cold easily. The back tables are a lot warmer.   Very good coffee but they charge you by the glass, but I hear this is normal for Canada (not for an American)."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, the staff is very French (in a good way). Been here twice now and enjoyed the experience.   Salted Carmel crepe was delicious. Latte was average. Price points on the menu are great."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. The place wasn't too busy at all. Got a table right away.   Food was great! But the service was a little slow considering how they were not busy. Our glasses were constantly empty. We had to keep asking for water refills.    We felt a little rushed at the end to get out but they were still open. I get it, if you were busy you want to flip the table and make more money. But there was only 2 other tables there! Slightly frustrating because we were catching up with friends that were about to move away. ?"}
{"text":"Brunch is very good. the first true creperie in Calgary. The all team behind is from France. the owner / chef dominique is from Britany. they have traditional cider drink."}
{"text":"Great night out! The Galettes are terrific. Service was great and not so great. When our server was around she was awesome, the problem was she was not around enough. Tough to have a conversation over the noise but overall lots of fun."}
{"text":"Calgary's best for moules frites, galettes and crepes. Even the most refined palettes will enjoy the casual French offering at this beautifully appointed restaurant."}
{"text":"A distinctive, nice and comfy place with an offer of unique selection of galettes (crêpes). We were able to make a same-day reservation in the morning for a party of 10 for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Let's say you know that person who you want to get to know better (you also made a claim that you are a foodie and are regretting that choice now as sobriety catches up to you) Luckily for you this is the perfect brunch experience.  Suzette's absolutely did the trick! It was a fantastic experience where the food was exquisite, the coffee and mimosa stunning and we were fortunate enough to have a real French waiter who turned a lovely brunch into a memorable experience! I had the Norwegen (of course in French) which was a perfect balance requested by my body between light and heavy, the salad and crepe with salmon was a wonder blend with the leech and cream on the inside which filled my post stampede night requirements.  I highly recommend this location as the staff was on point , food was great, and ambiance perfect down to the faucets in the bathroom)  I will definitely be back  Bien Joué"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Cassis so I had to try Suzette Brittany. I find the ambience and service similar to Cassis. Friendly, professional and passionate servers. A pretty,  airy room with lots of natural light.  For the food - I was all over the mussels. Unlike Cassis, SB offers mussels every day :-) Broth was delicious, so much that I spooned most of it in my belly. I enjoyed the homemade garlic aioli and ketchup.   My friend enjoyed her mushroom galette, which was served with a brightly dressed salad.   High quality ingredients, reasonable prices, and great service/ambience. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Overall pretty tasty and nicely set up restaurant.  Nice addition to 4th street selectionof dining choices. We started with the mussels and frites.  Delicious.  Warning for folks with peanut allergens:  they use peanut oil for frying their frites.   I guess however I'm not really that much of a galette type of guy.  The food is well prepared and tasty but left me wanting something more substantial.  Felt more like a brunch type food to me but I think others find it just fine for supper.  We had the bacon/potato and the lamb sausage/potato.  Both were good. For desert we shared the Suzette which I found a bit overpowering with the grand marnier but others may find it more to their liking. Service was very professional and unobtrusive.  Pricing was quite reasonable for the quality of food served. If I was a crepe type guy maybe would have given it 4.5 or even a 5."}
{"text":"St. Jacques was my plate. It's got seared scallop, sauteed leek & mushrooms, and velouté, paired with wine.  That's their galette. Price is is very reasonable. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Proper, authentic French food. There are a lot of Americanized French restaurants in Calgary, but this is the real deal. My family visits this restaurant often, and we love the selection and ambience. Service is also impeccable. The shtick here, like any creperie, is that you order a galette (savory buckwheat crepe) for your main course, and a crepe for dessert. There's a small selection of other dishes, like steak frites, fish, and pasta, as well as the world's largest Ile Flottante on the dessert menu, if you're feeling something else. Portion sizes are of course bigger here than they are in France, but the flavour is the same. Everything is tasty, cooked to perfection, and made with high-quality ingredients. We love the Forestiere. I absolutely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I have ever had in Calgary! St Jacques Galette with scallops and Bretonne crepe for dessert (caramel and butter). Yummy! Our server was wonderful and attentive. My friend and I originally ordered the caramel crepe to split but after we tasted it, we ordered a second! Everything had so much flavour. Will definitely be returning and recommending Suzettes to my friends."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch and was extremely impressed. A quant little restaurant in mission- we were greeted by a French waiter who has substantial knowledge of the menu and expressed a lot of enthusiasm about the product. You don't see a lot of this in the service industry anymore, so it was a pleasant surprise!   The menu is predominately crepes, both sweet and savoury, both of which I tried! First the fermiere, was filled with spinach and goat cheese with a tasty tomato compote on top.  Dessert was delicious with caramel glaze on top.   I recommend eating a savoury crepe to yourself and sharing a dessert crepe!"}
{"text":"Finally a legit crepe place in YYC :)  Tried the Complète and the Paysanne for our meals at lunch. The Complète was on the milder side flavour-wise but I really enjoyed the egg inside the crepe. The Paysanne was really good too with the bacon adding lots of flavour. We found that the Paysanne was a lot crispier (crunchier?) in texture and I'm not sure if this is because it was overcooked compared to the other one and/or if because the other one has an egg in it which makes it more moist and less crispy..? Either way, we enjoyed both.   The \"greens\" that come on the side of the Galettes are dinky little greens that don't even count as a salad, more like decoration, just a heads up. The crepes are more than enough to fill you up though so I didn't mind.   The dessert crepe was great too - we tried the Normande with caramelized apples and vanilla ice cream (from Village!). Perfect for sharing.   Our server was extremely knowledgable and friendly! Nice service and atmosphere. I liked that they had the windows wide open :) Would be really nice on a sunny warm day out.   Saw that they have other dishes here like pasta and salads - I'll have to go back to try sometimes. But if you're looking for a great crepe, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I loved it.  Our waiter was wonderful. My only two beefs you feel cramped and the last time I was there it was so loud my girlfriend and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation. As much as the food is wonderful, part of going out for a meal is the conversation. Hoping the noise level will be better at the new Britannia location. Not the place to take anyone with hearing issues."}
{"text":"Was good galettes and crêpes ( my favorite is the CIDER from Bretagne, back to the ethnic!!! ) the waiter was pretty nice"}
{"text":"Perfection! The martinis are incredible and the lyonnaise salad is delicious! It's an intimate little spot on 4th street and the staff are wonderful. I've been there 4 times and I've loved it every single time. Definitely go there - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a great little piece of French on 4th st sw. Everything on the menu is amazing as I frequent this place quite often. Fav gillett is Norvigene and of course crepe suzette. Moulles and frites are done just right. Good wine list and most service staff know what to recommend. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot on 4th and I've only tried their dessert crepes but the savoury ones look so good too.  The mussels are fantastic with a light cream broth and it's plentiful, plump, accompanied with fresh cut fries.  Fries are not greasy, crunchy and there's alot so bring a friend or partner to share.  If I had some bread I'd use it to dip the broth with and have major carb overload.  To finish off dinner we had the Normande crepe with caramelized apples, whip cream, vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce... Delicious to the last bite!  We came for dessert but ended up sharing the mussels and one dessert crepe which was enough.    Service was great as usual, friendly and casual with a bit of French flair. It's a small place so tables are seated close to each other.  I love sitting close to the windows in the summer as you get the fresh open air and have a view of 4th street."}
{"text":"Busy ladies lunch spot. We had the potato leek soup. It was nice and creamy. For main course we had the spinach, mushroom and egg galette. It was tasty. We also had the seared scallops , leek and mushroom galette. It was very nice also. The Americano coffee was good. For dessert we split a banana, chocolate and chantilly cream. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Stopping by Calgary for business, searched the web for top restaurants and Suzette's Bistro repeatedly pops up in search results - displaying stellar reviews across the board, perhaps due their exquisite menu. However, my experience was nothing out of the ordinary. The crêpe I had chosen was recommended as the go to and most popular option, St Jacques (scallops). In short, it had two pieces of scallop with a small salad on a (bland) crêpe. Theres nothing wrong with that, but it ain't first place yelp worthy."}
{"text":"Very quaint little restaurant. Overpriced for what you get. I had the potato and mushroom galette. It was Very dry and I paid 3 dollars extra for cheese that I couldn't find. Bar is very limited for selection of drinks. Couldn't make a cosmo and didn't have club soda for a high ball."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary! Suzette Brittany Bistro is very quintessentially and unapologetically French. The taste palate here is very clean on the tongue, whilst being decadent and rich simultaneously. The St. Jacques galette is simply to die for; the mushrooms are beautifully fragrant in this, and complement the scallops and veloute sauce very well. The chowder is also so beautiful. I also commend the service here. My waiter was very knowledgeable and very helpful, and gave me some recommendations for wine pairings with my meal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place (took a colleague for lunch).  The decor is cute and the servers really are French (complete with whimsical hispter 'stache).  Didn't have any alcoholic drinks that day but they seemed reasonable-ish.  Had the St. Jacques galette and was quite underwhelmed.  There TWO whole scallops (albeit perfectly cooked) and a wee bit of leeks on top of a rather bland galette.  The whole dish was really on the dry side and the galette actually sticks to plate midway through eating it?!  At $21 this was poor value for my hard-earned bucks so I won't be back."}
{"text":"We flew into Calgary for a week of vacation in Rockies. The first place we stopped on our vacation to Banff National Park was Suzette Brittany Bistro. Wow! Truly a great kick-off to a fantastic vacation.  The atmosphere is so inviting and relaxed. We had a wide variety of crepes and food - with a table of diverse eating types that ranged from a six year old to a gourmet chef. The food was fresh and delightful.  The service was sophisticated and attentive. We felt at home and relaxed from the moment we sat down. The wine selection is narrow - but nice. Our server directed us toward a delightful bottle that simply elevated the level of the food.   The greens and the flavor of the crepes and meat were delicious. The Paysanne was fantastic. The Galettes were very well flavored with a number of traditional French preparations and accompanying tastes. We really enjoyed our meal and will most certainly return if we find ourselves back in Calgary anytime soon."}
{"text":"I can only give this place a 5 star with no doubt. Super delicious food, great customer service, super professional waiters, fantastic ambience and many more I can not describe in words. We were a party of 7 with kids and called few days in advance to book a table. Booking was easy and when we arrived we were seated in our reserved table but also were given few other options for seating that we decided not to take:) our table was at a very good spot of the restaurant. The waiter was always smiling, very friendly with us and the kids and paid close attention to all of our requests as well as picky kids requests. We ordered drinks, appetizers, food and dessert and they were all super super tasty. The bread that was served was fresh from their oven and we loved it.  Overall, great restaurant, nice atmosphere, professional service and I will definitely recommend this place and will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Went for dinner Friday night. It was quite busy so we were grateful to have reservations. The food and drinks were all to die for!! (Hoping I get the names right of what we ordered...) Had the French 75 cocktail. It was a very refreshing mix of gin and sparkling wine. We shared the salmon salad, I had a delicious crepe with mushrooms and potatoes. Then for dessert we shared the crepe that came with Carmelized apples and ice cream. The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"The salmon was raw. The scallops were tasteless. I had to ask for bread and butter three times. Waiter couldn't care less. Overpriced. Amazed that it has so many stars. Limited cocktail list. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Visited for my second time for lunch in a matter of months because it's just that good. My mom used to make us crepes as kids and I have carried on that tradition with my own family. They are one of my favourite things.  I love the feel of this place. It's small, quaint and very reminiscent of a cafe in Paris. It is also however very squishy and this is not always fun trying to get through the tables without bonking someone on the head. This is however not a deterrent to coming.  So far I have tried 2 Galettes: the Norvégienne and Paysanne. Both equally delicious. During our last visit the group of friends I was with shared a holiday cider as well. The service is always good but sometimes can be a little slow depending on how busy the bistro is.  This is the perfect place for both a lunch date or dinner date. Looking forward to trying something new on the menu next time."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding, the servers were extremely welcoming and attentive. And the food was splendid, my St.Jacques galette (seared scallop, sautéed leek and mushrooms,) was just perfect, if you like seafood I highly recommend you try it. My dad ordered the grilled chicken with mushrooms which was also exquisite. The place is a bit expensive but it's worth every cent."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat! It was amazing crepes savoury and sweet. They staff is fantastic. They know the food menu and wine menu very well! It's super clean and the decor is so perfect."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most delightful french inspired restaurants in the city. The food is amazing, the wine is absolutely lovely and they have a lot from France and the restaurant itself is small but always bustling! It can get a little hot, especially on a warm summers day. The service was great and the lovely ladies that took me here as part of my bridal shenanigans enjoyed all the food put in front of us. If you want French food this is where you need to come, they have everything rom galettes to the fine rosé from the Provence region. This place is a must, you will fill like you are back in France!"}
{"text":"Suzette , oh Suzette ... Je t'aime. I have been to Suzette multiple times, I have tried their fabulous burger, the various Galette's, and the Crêpes ... even the side salad is nice and crisp. Their house cider is nice and dry.  The service is always good, and welcoming.  I will go back Suzette, again, and again."}
{"text":"Perfect. I've been at least a dozen times at this point and have yet to be disappointed. The service is always on point, the food spectacular, and the drinks menu is well curated. I have yet to try the burger, however my husband tried it and loved it. They accommodated a group of us for a work function and they were able to get everything out to us quite quickly. Definitely try the house cider - the dry one is my favourite."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other night. Loved it! My friend did too. When I suggested it originally he was not keen on the idea of having \"crepes for dinner\" but he went with it to appease me. He is very happy he decided to go there with me. He didn't know there was such a thing as savoury crepes.  I was drawn in by the excellent reviews....and that there are gluten free options for me to eat..even if it is only by chance that the galettes are made with buckwheat. :)      I had the spinach and goat cheese galette. It was delicious!! Huge and very filling. My friend had the ham and cheese galette and thoroughly enjoyed it. Another great thing is that even though the dessert crepes are not gluten free they can be made so...well, technically they're made the same as the galettes (but obviously with different fillings and presented differently). We were too full to even to have dessert though. Next time I will be more prepared to save room for dessert...even if I have to starve myself before I go there. Mmm...just thinking about it makes me want to go back there NOW!  Besides the food being so tasty, the service is superb and the atmosphere is very pleasant. I love the simplicity of the décor, very elegant. It truly reminded me of when I was in France.  Oh, and thank you to the people who wrote reviews which ultimately led me there....they did not disappoint! :) I definitely recommend Suzette Brittany Bistro to everyone! And, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great crepes Nice texture--light with just enough crisp but not dry Exceptional seasoning, especially on the scallop crepe Cute, quaint decor Pleasant background music  Cons: Took awhile to receive food even during off hour Don't recommend for parties greater than 4  Recs: Entree: scallop crepe Dessert: pear crepe (share with someone special)"}
{"text":"Visited just before closing for dessert with some friends who had been there before and recommended it. It was delicious! Had a sweet crepe with pear and it was wonderfully crispy and tasty. Although more pear would have been better! Definitely want to go back and try more of the menu -a savory meal and maybe a banana and chocolate crepe for dessert :) Staff had French accents and were very friendly...my group got to talking and ended up staying quite late past closing..they said it was no problem and were very nice about us losing track of time. Would be a great lunch restaurant too!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes!! The best in Calgary!! My favourite is the scallops one, I have tried already most of the menu and that's still the best one for me. However all others are delicious too! From the sweet crepes my favourite is the one with grand mariner and orange juice, but all others I have tried are great as well. In addition the wine is really really good, and the service super friendly. I recommend this place 100%. They have the best crepes in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"Suzette Brittany Bistro is a quaint, cozy, but at the same time modern french bistro. Once you enter the restaurant you will find the atmosphere is great, with all the beautiful decor and large windows that they leave open on sunny days. Right away it makes you feel at home and excited for some tasty food!  We come at least once or twice a month to Suzette's as we always know that the food will always taste great everytime. They are consistent and meticulous with every dish, and will only serve the best quality ingredients available locally.   We have tried almost every single dish on their menu, and our favorites would be the Suzette Burger, Lyonnaise Salad, Norvegienne Galette, and Ile Flottante. Also, always ask what their fish of the day is, as they always offer the freshest catch and they all taste superb.  Service at Suzette's is amazing as well. You are greeted and seated immediately, don't forget to reserve before coming as they are quite busy. The servers are very personable and attentive.  Overall, I definitely recommend Suzette's for any occasion! May it be lunch, brunch, dinner, date nights, etc. Suzette's a great place to sit down and have a nice meal with family, friends, and loved ones."}
{"text":"Excellent! While visiting my son in Calgary i wanted to have crepes and found this place in Downtown, close to my son's apartment and we all walked there. Great wine selection, definitely Frech feel and authentic French crepes. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Checked out Suzette Brittany Bistro for the first time.  First off, the ambiance is nice, very reminiscent of a French bistro. I ordered the Marocaine (lamb sausage, potato & mustard)....delicious. The buckwheat crepe was light and fluffy and the savory filling was mouth watering!!! I've never been to France but I imagine a French crepe to taste just like it!  For dessert, my friend and I ordered the Gariguette (berries, strawberry jam & chantilly)....tasted like summer wrapped in a tasty crepe! Our waiter was both attentive and friendly and especially helpful by pointing out his favorites as well as made great wine suggestions. The restaurant is small, and our table was only a foot away from other tables beside us, and I knocked my elbow a few times against the person next to me, but small price to pay for getting a last minute reservation. Will go again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Had two brunch experiences at Suzette and both were fabulous! I ordered Gallettes both times but am sure the crepes are just as good. Coffee is amazing! The only reason I didn't rate at 5 stars is because the servers are sometimes a bit slow. If you are in a rush for the cheque...expect to wait a solid 10 minutes to get everything sorted. I had to physically go up to the counter to pay the bill."}
