{"text":"Thanks fellow Yelpers, as it would have been highly unlikely that I would have stepped into this establishment w/o reading a few reviews first.  The outside appearance definitely fits the \"hole in the wall\" but it was really very good!  For under $20, a great breakfast: two orders of Steak and Eggs for the husband & I.  Friendly and fast service.  I would come here before Cracker Barrel or Waffle House any day!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! The food is home cooked- way better than you would get at a generic Waffle House or chain restaurant. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical of Chuck's, but then I tired the food and then I realized why Chuck's came so highly recommended by my friends. It was just like my mom's food. I suggest the French toast breakfast. This may be a hole in the wall, but you will not be disappointed! Chuck knows what he is doing. Also the waitresses are very nice and creepily good at remembering faces."}
{"text":"Lets face it, it's not hard to cook a good breakfast. Given the multitude of restaurants that can fry an egg other criteria come to the forefront when rating breakfast spots. Price, portion size, wait staff and good coffee come to mind. While I commend Chuck's for having livermush on the menu I find the rest lacking.  Price is a little higher than many others given the portion size. One slice of livermush? The waitress gave the impression she really didn't want to be there and when I ordered coffee she looked at the pot and said they were out. It was 10:30 and they serve breakfast until 11:00. Hello?  Is it too much trouble to brew a pot of coffee for a paying customer?  The biscuit was quite unusual having the texture and appearance of a rollscuit. All in all breakfast was palatable but the experience was not pleasant. Too bad, I really like patronizing little \"hole in the wall\" places but probably not this one again."}
{"text":"I must say I enjoyed my fish and grits today at this lil hole in the wall, customer service was also great the waitresses were on top of their game!!!! I'll be back for me :)"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much as is often the case with the good places. nice crisp bacon, fresh well cooked eggs, good pancakes super friendly staff. I'll definitely come back here if I'm back in shop Charlotte North Carolina. Never did find out what livermush is though."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tips with pinto beans, and cabbage. Good was absolutely delicious. Will return after I try some other local dives."}
{"text":"Cheap and fantastic. Perfect hole in the wall spot. Service was great. They didn't serve their full menu on Saturday but they had breakfast and burgers/sandwhiches which is plenty."}
{"text":"Chuck's Grill is a \"diamond in the rough.\" They are open for breakfast and lunch and have a loyal following of customers. Breakfast and lunch are very reasonably priced and the wait staff is very friendly. More often than not, they address their customers by name. Don't let the building fool you, you will not be disappointed. Good Value and good food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Looks sketchy but I promise you it's good. The seating is in weird shaped booths and have been there since they opened but the food is great.  The cook is awesome he is an older Greek guy who is friendly and remembers everyone's face! The servers are friendly and helpful. If you are looking for good hole in the wall breakfast place try this at least once."}
{"text":"Chucks plate lunches are the best. Stop in almost every time I'm in that area of Charlotte. Great lunch joint for construction workers and blue collar types. The food is spectacular."}
{"text":"Pro: really good home cooked food & good price

Con: waited over 30 mins to eat with only one cook (go figure), waitress was a little rude (brown hair chick) when I told her I wanted all of my order, for some reason they brought our plates out like 1 at a time, it's a TRUE hole in the wall which is perfectly fine with me but when it's packed its not good for manuevuring through---constantly getting bumped in your chair by waitresses and customers & with some seats being so loose and old it feels like you're gonna go airborne or the whole thing is gonna fall apart. 

Suggestion: ***CALL YOUR ORDER IN***
Don't go here if you're looking for anything remotely close to mid to upscale. Don't be thrown off by exterior. Even with the food being good, it's not worth the ridiculous wait."}
{"text":"The service gets worse and worse each time I visit. I try to overlook the rudeness of the blonde but enough is enough. Service is always extremely slow whether I call in or place a to go order. This morning I placed my to go order at 9:32. It is 9:58 and I am just getting in my car. I inquired twice and was told it was coming up. I realize that most items are cooked to order but I just can't pretend that I'm not bothered when people who enter and order after me get their orders before me. I'm sure this will be my last trip!   I'm sure I can get a Greek Omelette, home fries, and bacon elsewhere. At least that's how Chuck's make me feel."}
{"text":"Its your basic diner/grill.  With no other non-chain options in the local area, it is the best around.  Breakfast is fast, good, and cheap.  Lunch is more southern style maybe even considered soul food.

Its a little shack kinda near the hood, but it serves its purpose.  Everything is a little greasy, but what else would you expect.  Its rarely packed, but it seems like theres always somebody there.

They close after lunch, time seems to varies."}
{"text":"Went one morning for breakfast and it was actually good!! French toast is very good!! Don't let the curb appearance run you off!! It's a great hole in the wall restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch!  Best burger in town!!  If you are craving an awesome dive diner then head here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is located at 8000 Old Statesville in Charlotte, just south of Harris Blvd. The location it shows on Yelp is too far north so the directions are wrong."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance on the outside fool you. This place is a popular spot known for that greasy spoon concept but fantastic breakfast food. Food is plentiful and extremely cheap the man behind the grill knows what he's doing you can tell he's a veteran. They also know how to cook liver mush perfect. Breakfast specials will leave you full and sleepy definitely a place to go when sobering up from a hangover or late night."}
{"text":"Always good food, friendly service.... it takes you back in time when the food was good and people were friendly.. I recommend that everyone try this place... it is a local spot that has been there for it seems like forever, there is a reason why it's been around for so long... Good Food & Friendly Service!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! It's a \"hole in the wall\", but it most definitely delivers with food. Family owned business, everyone is always so sweet. We've come for breakfast a few time & never disappointed. Pancakes, biscuits, hash browns are all AMAZING!"}
{"text":"i love it because it has the best breakfast, lunch and dinner menus in old statesville rd."}
{"text":"The building and decor aren't much to look at but the food and the service are worth the visit."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a Sunday and everything was absolutely fabulous. Small hole in the wall restaurant. Family owned. Service was awesome and wait staff was very friendly and helpful. The cook, which I believe was the owner was absolutely on point. One of the best breakfasts I've had in a while. Will definitely be coming back and recommend you stop on in as well!"}
{"text":"Hole in Wall in Need of a few upgrades but a Good Value

My wife and I went to Chuck's for Brunch two weeks ago for Saturday Brunch. Calling it a Bruch is a misnomer since with the exception of burgers and a few fast food grill items, it's just a Breakfast menu.

We got there around 12 and they close at 1 pm so they were out of a couple of breakfast special items.  My wife is not a breakfast person so she order Salmon Patties and a side of fruit.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare, eggs cooked well, hashbrowns and toast.  The reason for order the ribeye medium rare is because it's always overcooked and I was hoping for something around a medium.

Nope - well done again. To compensate, the eggs cooked well were runny. At least the hashbrowns and toast were excellent.

The room is one of those places where they try and shoe horn more people and tables than the room can comfortably accomodate.  Went to the rest room to wash my hands and had to walk a maze around people, tables and chairs to get there and event then, I had to ask some patrons to move just to get through.

The restrooms need a bit of an upgrade, at least in lighting.  There is one common sink for both the men's and women's  bathroom located outside the restrooms in between the entrance to the two.

As far as service, this was the high point.  Our server could not have been better. She was there when we needed her and not there when we did not not need her. Could not have been better.

Prices are very reasonable and for that reason, it's a good value.

Before we left,we looked at the full menu and specials for the rest of the week. Much more expansive with a lot of other options on the menu, particulary of what we call comfort food. Maybe Saturday Brunch is too limited.  My wife did make the comment that we should try it some other time during the week to explore those other options."}
{"text":"Let's start with truths: 
Breakfast is made with love
Steve can cook a hell of a breakfast 
Price is right. 

Cons: 
Small (really a positive) 
Exterior needs a redo 

With that said go with an open mind the food is great"}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning the staff was amazing and I enjoyed it!! Me and mom will defiantly be back!!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab some homestyle breakfast. A great local diner. They're open from 5am to 2p on weekdays and 12 on saturdays. The prices are great! Definitely stop by if you have time! Great service and even better people. They have specials everyday. I will def come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Warning....this is a HOLE in the Wall Kinda Place.  It makes nothin' fancy look pretty fancy.  But, its a great place for a traditional breakfast.  Great people watching of patrons who stopped in for breakfast on their way to the job site.  The small staff is friendly, and the food is made to order. Two Eggs, a Meat, Hashbrowns, Toast, and Coffee.....all for about Five Bucks."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Not a luxe atmosphere but who cares?! Best \"hole in the wall\" in the Northlake area for brunch after church Sunday."}
{"text":"Always a hit when I come to Charlotte.  I feed the whole family mine and my sister's family for $30.  The food is so good and the biscuits are awesome.  Nice hole in the wall for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Can't beat Chuck's for price and quality.  It's not the nicest place as far as looks go, but it's a great spot for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"We came here for an real old fashioned \"country\" breakfast and that's what we got! I ordered the country ham and eggs breakfast and a liver mush biscuit! First their biscuits are homemade and they are great! The liver mush needs a more appetizing name for the weak hearted but it was very tasty. It tasted more like liver than liver pudding... YUMMY! The country ham was perfect and salty, just as it should be. The only complaint is that the food took over 30 minutes! It's a small place and it was full but not bursting at the seams. Shouldn't have taken that long but we were pleased!"}
{"text":"First up, if you click on directions on Yelp it will take you to Huntersville and NOT the true location. Click on the address as this is correct.  Just south of W T Harris Blvd. Next to U Haul.
Don't be scared off by the outside.
The inside is full of warmth and hospitality ! Everyone was wonderful and helpful.  The food is darn right good and honest. Super value for money. We will be going again as the experience alone is worth the visit."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of charlottes hidden gems. It's located off of Harris blvd on old statesville road. Next door to Family dollar. This is a small family run business with 5-6 booths that seat 3-4 and a few tables. The menu has a nice variety of traditional American breakfast and lunch, think roadside diner. The turkey sausage is tasty and I also tried shredded hash browns which I asked to be well done and they had just right crisp on them not almost burnt like some places. The kitchen is just opposite the seating and the cook greets you as you walk in. The lady who serves as waitress is polite and works quickly, the food doesn't come out super fast as everything is made to order. The inside is very bare bones so don't expect cuteness but they will have all you need. Prices are VERY reasonable. Get here early, they close by 1 pm"}
{"text":"This has fastly become one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It is a typical \"hole in the wall\" that i passed on a regular basis before trying. Boy was i happy i did. I dont think there is a bad dish on the menu...my staples are the french toast and the salmon patties...both are just like Grandma used to make. If you are in Charlotte and you havent tried Chucks, you are losing at life. 

Ambience - 3/5, old school grungy diner

Service - 5/5, the staff are super friendly and always smiling

Food - 5/5, superb, excellent

Price - $, who knew that food this good could be do affordable"}
{"text":"First Time visit and expected a whole in the wall atmosphere. I got the salmon patties with hash browns and eggs. The food was great for the price but I waited at least 40mins for my food. It is one chef so next time will call in advance. Customer service was fair but the unexpected long wait overshadowed everything."}
{"text":"So,  I ate my food before I could take a picture!! I had the 2 pancakes,  2 eggs,  liver mush and sweet tea for $5.50. Husband had 2 salmon cakes,  grits,  eggs and a biscuit. $5.50. Total for both meals $12 and change.  This is diner food prepared diner style with an open kitchen. The decor is old diner,  but I didn't go for the ambiance,  I came for the food!
The food was delicious.  The pancakes were flavorful,  the eggs over medium were perfect as well as the liver mush.  My husband's breakfast was also delicious.  
I would definitely come back.  The service is excellent.  The ladies out front were efficient and friendly.  Dirty tables are bussed immediately.  
If you aren't too picky about the decor,  you'll love this gem,  too."}
{"text":"Best little breakfast place I've been in a while. 
Superior customer service, the owner treats you like your family.
He even remembered my son's name even though this was only our second visit. 
Excellent food and fantastic staff.
Not to bad on the wallet either!"}
{"text":"Great deal for the amount of food.  I didn't give it a higher score because although it is cheap, they don't crank the food out quickly enough.

I thought the biscuits and gravy were alright, but not something I would order again.

I really want to pull for this place but I can't until I sample more of the menu.  There is only so much praise I can give for bacon, sausage, and eggs."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable price .. perfect spot for brunch . Though service is good it's slow .. Keep in mind that you will wait 45 minutes If you are coming in on weekend ; it's worth the wait. Perfect family run little cafe."}
{"text":"Chucks is a great hole in the wall diner. All the regular favorites good portions served fresh and hot. Good burgers and lunch fare as well. Everything is cooked to order and you can see the kitchen from the counter. One of my favorite breakfast spots in town"}
{"text":"I've had the double cheeseburger twice now and it is absolutely delicious! For under $7 you get burger fries and a drink. Chuck's is the classic hole in the wall hidden gem that exceeds expectations. Friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Very good hole in the wall diner! Slightly long wait due to high volume of customers. Has that small town feel and the taste of a homemade meal."}
{"text":"Real, old school, hole-in-the-wall kinda place.  Small (estimate capacity at 60) but food (French toast special here) was down-home good.  I highly recommend for cozy, comfortable, casual meet.  Very good service &  $."}
{"text":"Walked in and right back out. The room was very greasy...did not want to smell like what they were grilling when I left. Also not a vegetarian friendly place."}
{"text":"hidden gem. the best place ever for breakfast or lunch. fair price and great staff."}
{"text":"I stopped and had lunch at chucks today, and they are very friendly and good ole meat and 2 with tea and free cup of soup.
they also open at 5:30 am so if you are on your way to work say at 6:30 you can swing by  and grab a breakfast  samich!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Very small and unassuming but the food is delicious. A friend and I got the french toast platters which is a lot of food for less than $7. I would have never noticed let alone visited this type of place without all the reviews from other Yelpers. I will definitely be back for a quick, cheap & delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here based on yelp reviews and this has quickly become a family favorite. This is a old mom and pop type of place that has not had the decor updated probably ever. But the food is fantastic and the prices are amazing. And, if you are a regular with a regular, they ask you if you will have your regular. The French toast is really good and their home fries are something to write home about. I love this place and it has become my regular Sunday haunt."}
{"text":"Disappointing for me. I might return for lunch one day but I would not visit for breakfast again.

The place is in descript. I get that and that doesn't bother me. It is a small place with crowded seating, a coffee area that could use a good cleaning and just not the cleanest looking place. 

I ordered an omelet with hash browns. And it was just okay. Hash browns are frozen variety. My omelet came with cheese and instead of putting it on the inside of the cheese, all they did is put the sliced processed cheese on the bottom of my container and then put the omelet on top of it and let the heat melt the cheese. This is definitely not the business. My omelet was overcooked, lots of brown on it and it did have plenty of filling but I rather just drive a mile or so away and go to favorite spot."}
{"text":"this spot is a little of the the grid if you're not in the know. Chucks serves up great breakfast specials and lunch is good too! ( smothered pork chops are DA bomb for lunch)They have a down home hospitality and great customer service!!"}
