{"text":"Service is not good! Served wrong dishes without explaining! Had a bad dinner feeling. If your waiters can improve a little bit more your attitude, will be better!"}
{"text":"This is the worst review I have had to write. It was my last night in Toronto, and I regret having my last dinner at this place. The food wasn't aweful, but the experience was a complete bust. My rating is mostly based on service and false advertisement. Don't expect good service here if you're not Chinese. 
Ordered the beef pancake, which I enjoyed. Also got the clams which weren't half bad. I was mostly disappointed by the smoked meat in alms bowl because the smoked meat was just cut up bacon and looked nothing like the meat in the picture. Also, the clams were advertised at 11.99, but when the check came it was 15.99. I generally don't mind paying more for good food, but the quality of these clams was at most worth 11.99. Anyhow, there was no arguing with the staff because they seriously don't give a shit if you don't speak the language. 
Overall, not worth it."}
{"text":"It's Chinese food. It's edible. That's about it...
Just kidding, I won't stop there, because the Chinese food here just didn't settle right! They're  not authentic Sichuan style and OVERLY SALTED- even the Xiao Long Baos were half rate. The servers are native Chinese speakers (some of them spoke English) and the venue is a modge podge of different furniture sets that you'd expect from the run of the mill hole in the wall Chinatown Restaurant. A spider showed up and crawled onto the food, and one of the servers just swatted it with a checkbook, RIGHT ONTO ANOTHER CUSTOMER! The soups were probably the best part of the entire meal that came in cute yet inconvenient to drink from cups."}
{"text":"This is the second time in Toronto we were glad our cell phones didn't work outside of the US so we couldn't be turned off by the bad Yelp reviews. We took a chance on this place when we passed by and couldn't have been more satisfied when we left. It seems that our northern neighbors don't Yelp as much as we do in NYC, so if a restaurant gets bad reviews, it's kind of screwed because not many people here will try it and give it a good review if things have changed.

Well, Yelpers, things have changed for the better here. We peered in, entered to a clean restaurant, were greeted in a friendly manner and we delighted with the food. The price and portions were good and the flavors here are excellent, as Yelpers did point out. We tried the string beans(forgetting to eschew the pork) and it was cooked perfectly, crispy and and fresh and full of garlic goodness in every crunchy bite. The bean curd skin, with its light dressing of soy, didn't have the oomph of the string beans, probably due to the other dish's surfeit of garlic, but it was certainly tasty and felt like a light, healthy entree. Nothing was drowning in the grease I normally find in NYC Chinese restaurants so both the dishes tasted fresh. The service staff must have read the reviews because they were so far from rude, or maybe management just changed staff. The place didn't seem outdated at all, but the last review about that was from 2015. As far as not taking credit cards, many Chinese restaurants are cash only. We paid in cash anyway, not really perturbed by that. Perhaps Tian An should just post it or put it on their menus so customers won't be disgruntled.

If you live here, I seriously encourage you to give this place a try. If you're a tourist visiting, try it for a very good Chinese meal. We left happy and full, quite pleased with finding this gem."}
{"text":"Please note that I give five stars to the taste of the food. They are authentic Jiangxi Cuisine with very low price. I am very happy to find out this restaurant since I am a native Nanchang. 

The same as other reviews, service was so bad. Be aware that they didn't want you to pay by credit card. They will claim that their POS machine is broken."}
{"text":"While the flavours are great, the service (rude waiters) and outdated decor dragged down an otherwise quality rating. We usually order the big pot of hot soup with fish fillets. The dish comes with 4 ingredients of your choice (mushroom, tofu, rice cake, more mushrooms). The spicy eggplant dish is tasty too. The flavours in the intestines dish is savoury, but the texture of the intestines are a turnoff for me personally. If you plan on coming here, hope that the female waiter is not working that day!"}
{"text":"Doesn't accept international credit cards. Used 1:1 for USD to CAD exchange and refused to explain the reason. What really outraged me is the rude attitude of one waitress. I ordered an eggplant dish - the skin was so stiff that it became totally inedible. Other dishes were good. But I'd seriously advice the owner to improve their service. Chinese restaurants are competitive here. Fine food + horrible experience doesn't help with their business."}
