{"text":"Don't waste your time!  They boast about all the beers they have on tap - NOT!  We planned to go here for my daughters birthday this past Saturday.  There were seven of us - the waitress informed us only two beers on tap!  When asked several times why - she just shrugged her shoulders!  My son-in-law then ordered a beer on tap - all out!  When I then stated I wanted a Tangueray and tonic - she asked me to repeat it - then when read it back - Tangerine and Tonic!!!!  There were only 3 other people in the bar at the time - so we decided this was not worth it!  We also remembered the last time we were in there - they got our food orders all wrong!  So we told the waitress we were leaving - we were so frustrated.  A member of our party said \"Do you want us to turn off the \"Open\" sign on our way out!\"  We went to Panini's and had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Tried Bar 145 for the first time after a show at Kent Stage. Hadn't eaten before the show, and their meals were just right for an after show (or after any kind of party you're attending in Kent) meal. Ate at the bar which was open air and very comfortable on this warm Northeast Ohio night. Our bartender (Kara) was excellent, very attentive, and thoughtful enough to give us a \"10 minute warning\" on the kitchen closing. Our meals tasted excellent, especially the Apple Pie Burger. Never would have put that combination together myself, but glad I tried it!

Their website states you can book your special event with them. Considering the quality of their food and their excellent service, I think it would make a great small gathering location."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great drink selection, good service, and live music on the weekends. It's my favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time yesterday and loved the atmosphere however they were out of food- nearly the whole menu! We didn't know that until after we ordered and our waitress informed us they were out of what we ordered. I picked something else out. They were out of that too. Then she listed everything they were out of and there was hardly anything left! I get this happens sometimes in restaurants but after reading the reviews on Facebook and Yelp I see this is a common reoccurrence. So many other options in Kent, I probably won't be back. How weird would it be if we had to  call and ask \"Do you have food today? Are you out of anything on your menu?\" before Going again."}
{"text":"The service is awful  and they are always out of things. The one night I was there they were out of BEEF. It's like really your a burger spot and your out of beef. Then a few weeks ago they only had one beer on draft cause they were sold out. The buyer for bar 145 should be fired and so should the manger. The food is good but it's not worth it. Do yourself a favor a go to Rays Place instead!"}
{"text":"On the waitress' recommendation I  had  the patty melt with obligatory truffle fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly to order and fries were not disappointing.  I'd do it again and bring friends!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was friendly, however the food was extremely slow and came out cold. Painfully slow wait for simple burgers. The place wasn't even as busy as it could have been but that seemed to be there excuse.  Burgers tasted fine but experience was horrible and the luke warmness outweighed the good taste.  They gave us 10% off and manager didn't even take the time to come out and apologize for the poor dining experience, hardly makes up for it.  Not worth the too expensive prices."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since opening, and each time there has been some sort of hiccup in our experience (e.g., kitchen was out of the item I ordered and waitress didn't tell me until 30 minutes afterwards, mistake made with smaller portion of an item being ordered and then being charged for the full portion, waitress failed to submit ticket to the kitchen and I never got my stuff, etc etc). Food is always good when it does arrive. I would assume that this process of \"working out the kinks\" is fairly normal for a new restaurant. What is not normal in my experience, however, is the caliber of service that each of these hiccups was met with. Without fail, each time there was an \"incident\" the manager (owner? I don't really know) came over to our table to apologize and let us know the issue had been dealt with. On one occasion, he bought my table a round of drinks and sent over a free appetizer. And this is why, despite some problems with service, I will continue to return. Nicely done, management!!

PS one small complaint... get your liquor license to serve on Sundays! :)"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place ...ONLY 1 down fall...the prices are really expensive. Drinks run from $3.00 - $8.00 bucks so look out... But, in all 5 thumbs up! Since, this place is in Kent...I wondering how many mommy's and daddy's will pay these bills..lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced. I cannot review the food because, although I waited over 30 minutes after they started to bring the food ordered by our party, they never brought ANY of my order! They were not crowded.  I would estimate only 20-25% full. This is the second time that the service has not been good. I hope they go out of business soon so this location can be taken over by someone who knows how to run a restaurant. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Food is normally great but service is far from it.  Today I was told, plenty of tables are available, no one else is waiting,  but it's our dinner rush and they're only seating large parties,  my party of 3 will have to wait 30 minutes! Seriously? !"}
{"text":"This place is just AWFUL! The staff I cannot even begin to explain how rude and nasty they treat customers. I witnessed the staff cussing at customers and treating them terribly. I cannot understand how this place is still in business. They need to overhaul the staff and get new management. Do not bother to spend your money at this place... you'd be better off going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing waiter and good beer.  Atmosphere was nice and has patio seating also. Had the balsamic bleu cheese burger and lobster Mac and cheese.  Burger was full of flavor had me going back for more."}
{"text":"My first visit came this weekend, and I have to say that it may be one of my new go-to's in the area, especially during the summer months when sitting on the outside patio is a must. Let me explain. It's a fairly large space, and the acoustics inside are for the dogs. I had to shout at the hostess just to tell her how many were in our party, and I promptly asked if we could dine on the patio. Luckily for us, we were sat at a very nice, cozy space on the patio. While the tables are a little crowded, we never felt like we were listening in on others' conversations, and never felt as if we were being listened to by the other customers. Our servers (one was a trainee) were very attentive, and made some great suggestions. My both created our own burgers (one black bean, one beef), and neither one of us could find one thing wrong with either of them. My burger was perfectly cooked and juicy. The toppings I chose were divine (swiss, bacon, arugula, roasted onions, balsamic mayo & spicy mustard). We ordered two sides to share: Truffle fries, which are out of this world and the onion petals - which, on this occasion were greasy and undercooked - maybe steer clear of them and stick to the fries. The drink selections are fantastic, but it was surprising to find that two bottles of beer were nearly as expensive as the mixed drinks. The Kentucky Lemonade was the perfect drink for a warm summer evening, but my second drink, a classic sangria, was syrupy and way too sweet. Avoid that. 

Overall, I have a feeling I'll be back again soon this summer. The food prices are no more expensive than comparable burger joints, and I'm excited to try some other combinations of toppings. I wish they were open a little later, though. For a college town place, I think they'd be well served to keep their kitchen open on Fridays and Saturdays for a couple more hours."}
{"text":"Apple.
Pie.
Burger.
Who would have ever thought of such an amazing creation!

I've  been here several times......
On each occasion, I've noticed the following:
1) They're always busy.
2) Every dish I tried was AMAZING.
3) They're  always busy.

If you want a quick, cheap, burger, hit the Burger King on 43. The double whopper is pretty good, less than 5 bucks, and you can get in and out in under 10 min.

But If you want something better, something your taste buds can appreciate, created by someone who obviously attended culinary school, AND in a really cool atmosphere......do yourself a favor, set aside one hour of your busy schedule, grab 25 bucks out of the ATM, and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Me and my ex went here with no real expectations at the end of the school year, and I'm a harsh food critic. But if you like burgers, if you like bars, if you like happy (yes I said happy, not fun, not a good time, but the actual feeling of being happy) then this is your place! Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. The choice selection is superb. I just wished it was bigger.... something my ex wishes also wishes a lot."}
{"text":"this gets no stars. the chicken in my taco tasted rotten and i confronted the manager about it. she rudely came up to the table and gave us so much attitude. our server was the only good part of the night."}
{"text":"i've been to this bar 145 a couple of times now, hit or miss and the most recent visit, was by far, the BEST i've ever had. went to dinner with husband and 2 of our friends and we were all blown away! first, i would recommend anyone who dines here, to ask for Ashley as your server, she was so attentive and friendly. She answered every question we asked and knew EVERYTHING about the menus. she recommended the wild honey mojito and it was delicious! For dinner she recommended the bar nachos for appetizers and the simpleton and apple pie burgers for our meals, so we took her advice. The food was amazing! The only thing I did not like was how long the meals took, but the server came over and apologized for the delay since they were busy and  reassured us everything was working and offered another round of drinks. By far the best place and service we've had in Kent in a long time!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I went there, I was really impressed. Then I started attending weekly trivia and the food has quickly declined every week. Almost every single time I get a build your own burger, one thing is missing from it. It still tasted okay, but I paid for bacon and I wanted it. However, I went yesterday and the entire experience was AWFUL. I received my burger and it was cold. Not lukewarm, COLD. I sent it back, and received another lukewarm burger. Worse than this, it looked and tasted like a frozen burger that you get from the grocery store or a fast food restaurant. I wanted a medium-rare burger, but I got a gray, cold burger instead. In addition, the parmesan truffle fries had virtually no seasoning on them; they were completely dry (usually they are covered with truffle oil and parmesan).
I know that Bar 145 can do better. The burgers have always been great and tasted freshly made until now. Maybe something was going on. I don't know. But I was severely disappointed. 
Another tip: when you give someone a cold burger, don't just give them 25% off and then bring back the same burger!!!! (I do not blame my personal waitress for any of this, she was great)"}
{"text":"The menu here changes a little every time we are in. But it is always delicious. Best burger place in northeast Ohio definitely. Love the fries and sauces. The outdoor space is great in the summer."}
{"text":"Glad to see some vegetarian options on the menu.  The build your own with the black bean veggie burger has a lot of flavor.  The cucumber relish is fresh and tasty.  The bar has a good selection of beers.  Nice place to grab dinner on a Sunday night in Kent. 

Cons: The kitchen is a little slow but I am sure that will improve with time.  The prices are a little on the higher side."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times... the service is usually so-so... never very prompt, and never overly friendly. The food is pretty good, although I usually stick to the same thing... create your own burger, and green bean fries. The green bean fries are delicious! They're my favorite thing to get! I've had a few martinis and was less than impressed with all of them..."}
{"text":"Service was acceptable, didn't like all the high dining chairs....very uncomfortable.  Food was good but not great and certainly not worth the price.   The atmosphere will appeal to the young college crowd as will the cheap drinks during happy hour.  Bar seems to be very slow to get drinks out.
  Salad for dinner is about half the size of one at Rocknes for about the same price. 
   Burgers are appealing for build your own and add from the eclectic list of add ons.  In fact,  too many choices and added complexity.  Go to Swensons and add everything  ( mustard, pickle and onion) , three times the burger for one third the price.
Many better choices in Kent area than Bar 145."}
{"text":"WORST customer experience of my life. One star is being too generous. 

In short, the manager on duty the night of Saturday December 10, Justine, did not believe that my out of state license was real. In fact, she was so convinced it was a fake ID that she would not give it back to me. After at least an hour wait for the whole ordeal to be sorted through, the police were finally called in order to verify the ID was indeed real, and it was. This entire experience was not only incredibly unprofessional but also incredibly embarrassing to me, and the 6 guests who were with me. I will NEVER be returning and I will make sure everyone knows about the abysmal customer experience I received there.  

Too Long, Didn't Read: Justine took my license and ended up calling the police who proved it was real and she never apologized."}
{"text":"Beer is good and so is the live music, but.... I ordered the tomato parmesan soup and it was refrigerator cold haha. I think they must just put it in the bowl and microwave it but were so swamped they forgot. I ate my cold $8 cup of soup without complaint but I'm not eating there again"}
{"text":"This was one of the single worst experiences I've ever had. They were out of the beer we wanted but didn't tell us for 10 minutes. Then we ordered two new beers and they gave them to the table beside us and then told us they were out of that. When we got the bill the beer was on our bill and we ask to have it removed and our bill actually increased with beers that we didn't order. The food was really good and unfortunately because of the service and everything we probably will never get it back there. Really disappointing when you drive an hour to go to a restaurant and then to get service like that."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. Food is pretty bland. Burgers aren't anything special. Mac cheese is more bland than box mac and cheese you'd buy from the store. I like that they are trying to be a gastro-pub foodie place, it just isn't working....

The fries are pretty amazing. If I come back again that's the only thing worth ordering."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, bar wings are my favorite. Looking forward to the outdoor bar being done."}
{"text":"Worse place ever!!!!!!!  With 25 people in the entire place it takes over 45 minutes for our food. They completely forget to make my meal so I get to starve.  The one meal they do decide to make is over cooked and cold.  Never again.  This place sucks!!! Stay away."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Two bars. Inside and outside seating areas. Great food and hangout place near Kent State University."}
{"text":"I give this place one star only for the bourbon selection. I have given this place more than one chance and have always wondered how it stays in business. The service is horrible for as many people as they employ. For a burger joint you would think that your food would come within a reasonable time, with your sides along with it. Was there last time and had to ask 4 times if my fries were coming anytime soon. Had my cold burger done before they brought the fries out. The funny part is you can actually sit and watch your food get cold from your seat. They may want to just start calling names and have the customer go get their own food- that could cut down on cost by doing away with wait staff. Which by the way does not have a clue. I have given up on this place and advise anyone else to look elsewhere. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write. I've been here twice and had similar experiences both times. The short version would be if you like good drinks and burgers and are okay with absolutely horrendous service, come here.
The first time I came here was in March with two friends. We came for lunch and got martinis. I had a burger. The burger and fries were awesome, and I had a delicious (but of course expensive) s'mores martini. The service was pretty darn slow, but it didn't completely turn me off to the place.
Yesterday, I had a wedding to go to in Kent and wanted to show my boyfriend around my college town beforehand. I mentioned this was a good place if he was in the mood for a burger and he was, so here we went. The patio seemed slightly busy, but the restaurant was dead inside where we sat. Our waitress took our drink order (just water, we had to save room for drinks later) and it took about ten minutes to get them. Water. Took ten minutes. Okay then... So then we order our burgers. Took nearly a half hour to get them. The next time we saw our waitress after the water was when she brought the burgers. Burgers don't take terribly long to eat, so we were done about ten minutes later. She didn't ask how they were or come over to check on us once. After we finished them, we sat there with dirty plates and no one checking on us for about 10-15 minutes. Finally we had to flag down some other waitress to see if somehow she could bring us our check, because at this point we had been at the restaurant for about an hour to eat BURGERS. The other waitress was very kind and brought us the check after about a couple minutes. We gave her our card with it and our original waitress brought it back to us after she cashed us out. She offered no apology or explanation. If some other waitress has to bring your table their check, you HAVE to know you did something wrong. It was quite possibly the worst service I've ever had.
That being said, I have no complaints about the menu, the food, or the drinks. Just be warned about the very low level of service you'll receive here."}
{"text":"Went here recently on a Thursday night. It was packed and VERY loud, and this was before the band started. However, the food was excellent. I had the lobster mac and cheese and my fiance had a burger. Both were great. The french fires are wonderful too. I'm a bourbon lover and they have every kind you can imagine. I ordered the house Manhattan and was not disappointed! I will go back but probably shoot for a Monday or Tuesday in hopes that it won't be as crowded and loud."}
{"text":"Lighting and general ambiance is very nice.  Wide assortment of beers and wines.  All the food I've tried has been excellent.  I admire their commitment to serving quality food.  

My only gripe is that it can be a little more expensive than the surrounding bars, but I often find the excellent food and service to be worth the extra money."}
{"text":"Was seated outside and sat waiting for almost 20 minutes and no one came to our table to see if we wanted to order."}
{"text":"Went after graduation for lunch, party of 10. It was not busy inside. We spent 2 hrs. to have a burger. The service was terrible and the food-  $10 for a burger- really? Got a coffee and asked for sweetener and watched the waitress go  outside, when I finally retrieved her and asked for the sweetener and asked if there was a problem she explained she was busy and had customers outside- so that is my problem? We never got napkins or silverware and had to get our own when the food finally arrived.
Will not go back, food isn't that good."}
{"text":"The burgers are great. Also their bourbon specialty drinks are different and strong. Love this place"}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened up, but now you get cold food and a stomach ache later. The only good thing about bar 145 is the live music and bar, don't waste your time, money, and health on the food."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten meat in 12 years. That changed today thanks to our waiter, who rang my veggie burger in as a beef party, then blamed the kitchen. Our receipt showed what actually happened.  No apology or discount. I'll probably get sick from the bit I ate before I realized what I was eating."}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad. Do not go there if you only have an hour to wait for your food to come. Unfriendly staff. Decent food, but unfortunately the people who work there leave a bad taste for customers. Very overpriced as well for the small portions they give you. 
Great bar at night though. Lots of fun, but very crowded. Outdoor patio is awesome."}
{"text":"Bring back the bacon mac'n cheese!

Our last visit was a definite miss. My husband and I went on a week night and sat outside. The service was ok, but the food wasn't that great and took forever. It wasn't very busy either which was frustrating. We might come back and hope for a better experience, but I'm not sure. The biggest disappointment was they they change their menu every so often, and they no longer have the bacon mac'n cheese. The noodles are different and there is no bacon. It's not worth $3"}
{"text":"Food is amazing love this place roasted red pepper aioli amazing. Great burgers. Truffle fries. Love eating here. Kids eat free Thursday"}
{"text":"Really unique options! The Mac and cheese is amazing! Creamy and sinfully delectable. I also ordered the black bean burger no bun with roasted peppers, caramelized onions, havarti cheese, and cucumber relish. Sounds like a lot going on and your right it was! All together my creation was great! You can create your own burger or order from their unique list. My boyfriend got the apple pie burger and it was very interesting. I enjoyed it a lot. We also got a side of fried artichokes to try which came with a garlic aioli, definitely yummy. Prices are reasonable. For some the portions might be considered on the smaller side, but I thought it was perfect. 

The atmosphere and layout of the place is pretty cool, in the summer when they can open the garage doors it will be really awesome to hang out. The waitress said they will have live entertainment every night, so I think it may become a place to stop in when I'm here in kent. Next time I come I want to try the baked Brie with spiced apples!

This place if definitely a nice new gem for kent! Hope they keep it up"}
{"text":"I've had a few carryout Bar145 experiences, but after dining in for the first time, I can tell you that's he way to go. I was really pleased with my dine-in experience. It wasn't too busy, so we were promptly seated and taken care of. Our orders came out quickly, and everything was really good. We ordered three starters- poutine fries, pretzel bites, and tempura green beans. I would definitely recommend all three- the unexpected star were the green beans! I ordered the Kobe burger, medium rare. It was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. Burgers come with truffle fries, which are pretty addicting. I was stuffed at the end of my meal, so I might go lighter on the starters next time."}
{"text":"Seriously if you are coming here to eat only I would give this place a solid B. Food is good and the ingredients they use are definitely trying to be upper class. This is done fairly well. However, if you plan on having a few \"non-well\" drinks or non-\"domestic\" beers with your meal bring some extra cash. Mixed drinks were incredibly watered down and craft beers are pricey. This rivals higher end restaurants and comes as quite a surprise when the bill comes. My date and I with two burgers and 3 mixed drinks each came to $100... will not be back for this alone"}
{"text":"Service was spotty... but it's 2016 and this place is still serving veal...in soup.  Nice conversation with manager was still unsatisfactory... \"we are a franchise and it's a signature dish.\"  So the signature dish is a cruelty food.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 was $80 w/ $7 appetizer. Watch for the add-ones they add up.  Don't get the double protein.  Single patty is plenty.  Our server, Mo, was tentative and helpful (and very cute)  Only 3 stars because of the questionable value for the money."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, menu had great choices.
Waited almost 30 minutes for 3 burgers, place was not even remotely busy.
Burgers are dry and bland. The fries were barely seasoned, and not good. The sauce was good though.
Don't waste your money, a $12 burger shouldn't be this bad."}
{"text":"The food is decent (for Kent anyway). The management is great--stopped to talk to us and answer our questions about how local local is. But the place is really way too noisy. Too loud music (even without a band playing) and poor acoustics. It'd be nice to be able to have a conversation without going hoarse."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 2.5 stars, or write 2 different reviews, I would. I LOVE this place to go out at night - they have awesome bands, great drinks and it's a fun atmosphere. FOr nightlife, I would give it a 4 or 5. However, the food is another issue. I would give it a 2. I got food here for the first time in years about a month ago, and it was not good at all. I ordered the tacos, a fish, a beef and a chicken. (Sidenote: I love tacos - I try to get them as much as I can from various places, so I like to think that I am a little bit of an expert). And the tacos were just - horrible. The beef was so fatty, I sent it back (after my waitress looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to send it back). I really just wanted it taken off my bill since I was full from the other two tacos (which were mediocre at best), and instead she brought out another one since the kitchen was already making it. Well - it wasn't much better than the first. So much fat on it. It was gross. So in the end, lesson learned - no more food there for me - only drinks and music."}
{"text":"We came here last week to see one of our favorite bands. We are regular customers who eat here about twice a week. We brought a group of 18 people with us who all ate dinner, drank well drinks, bourbon, and craft beers. After finishing our meal, we were told (very rudely) that they would be taking our table to make room for the college crowd that would eventually be coming in. We spoke with the manager about letting us remain at the table for the time being since it wasn't really busy at the time. He refused so unfortunately all eighteen of us left and went somewhere else for the remainder of the evening. Its a shame that they would take a loss of several great customers to cater to the students who eat and drink at home before they go out! We will not be back, nor will our friends. SMH"}
{"text":"A table of 8 on Friday evening and 6 orders came out wrong. Service was slow at best. Soup was asked for before the burger and it came with the burger and had at best 2 tablespoons of soup in the bowl. Wings were order off of the menu and later they told us they ran out of them. It's 7 on a Friday how can this be. Salad was ordered with a burger never delivered. They have plenty of staff standing around and they seem clueless. I've been coming here on and off since it opened a few years ago. Never again. Spend your lonely else where. If I could give it a zero star I would have."}
{"text":"I think that this may be the best restaurant in Kent, at least in regard to the quality of the food.  I have been about 15 times and only got a bad meal once (and that was in one of their odd burger combinations).  The regular burgers are very nicely cooked, and their other selections are also quite tasty.  The duck legs are a particular favorite of mine.  My five star rating would not apply in a more cosmopolitan area, but for a college town setting, and given the reasonable prices, this is a nice place to get lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great first experience a few months back, not great second one. Don't mind paying $7 for pretzel appetizer if it's good. They changed them since last time, and not a good change. And for a place that names itself after the temperature of medium rare, they should be pros at cooking to that request.  They weren't.  Seems to be too concerned with the college party/drinking atmosphere rather than a true gastropub."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I will not be back. We went last night and the atmosphere was lively, and the bartender taking our order was cordial, but that's where my positive remarks stop.

I ordered the mussels as an appetizer and I have to say, it may have been one of the worst dishes I've ever had. Salmon sauce with pepperoni and mussels?? It also tasted as if they poured an entire bottle of bad white wine in it... Not a good start. It's also an issue when they leave the crostinis in the sauce so they turn into a soggy mess...

My entree was a Kobe beef burger with arugula, herb goat cheese, black truffle aioli and their bourbon steak sauce. The beef itself was cooked very well, however I felt they really skimped on the toppings, applying just a little dash of each. Thankfully the beef was so good!! As for my sides, I got their truffle fries and Mac n cheese both of which were underwhelming. My fries were cold and lacked truffle oil and Parmesan cheese which they garnish them with, and my mac n cheese was served with pasta that was undercooked and trust me when I say undercooked, they were still hard, not the al dente one would want, and the cheese sauce lacked flavor. Both sides came out about 5-7 minutes after the burger was served... 

The meal itself came to $60 with 2 mixed drinks, 1 beer, 1 appetizer, 2 burgers, 3 sides, and a salad, which I Felt was a fair price.

Overall my experience was poor. My fiancé and I will not be back. The only saving grace for this \"gastropub\" is there drink selection, which I might even say is somewhat limited compared to other bars of the same type I've been to. 2 out of 5 stars, go for a drink but don't expect much more in the way of food."}
{"text":"I'm rather disappointed. I've been here multiple times now. The first couple times it was busy and our hostess had no idea how long it would actually take to get seated. She told me an hour when I saw 4-5 empty tables. When I pointed them out we sat down 5 minutes later. More recently, a manager openly scolded his servers in public. Very unprofessional. The food is over priced and takes 30-45 min minimum to get to you. Even when the place is empty. Unimpressed."}
{"text":"Love it! Self proclaimed foody, and I was savoring every bite! Ask for the bourbon steak sauce for anything, it's fantastic! We had it with the onion petals. Service was great, would love to make it a habit going there."}
{"text":"My husband I have been to Bar145 a few times now. Being a fairly new eatery and going the first time, the server did not tell us about the paper that was rolled up in a glass on our table. After ordering our burgers, I pulled out the paper to see what it was....it explained the name behind Bar145 and how we could order any meat, how you would like it cooked and the items you could choose to put on it! What a nice surprise you could do that....if only the server had mentioned it before we ordered. The second time nothing was mentioned again! Why have this at your table if you are never told you have this option! The food and fries are outstanding! THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE . I can understand a burger being cooked to 145, but getting a raw burger wasn't very appetizing. The server tried to convince us that it was cooked to 145 degrees.  No way, it was still raw. She didn't even suggest to get a new burger. The manager finely did come over after I was done eating and offered to get a cooked burger for my husband. The second time we went, after being seated and taken our order, a big group came in that our server took. Needless to say, we never saw her again. We never received refills on our drinks and we had to get her attention to get the bill. BAR145 needs to retrain their staff. To suggest how much to leave for a tip on our bill, only reminds me not to give a very big tip if they don't know their job. So to sum this up, good food, poor service."}
{"text":"I liked it, but my friend could've gotten some food poisoning from some salmon salad sandwich shit. Jesus! Nice environment though. Live music. Could've had a better draft selection though. Pretty garbage draft!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Bar 145 in the heart of Kent/ Acorn Alley.  We came in this past Saturday evening. It was an early dinner service and the place was a bit crowded, but no wait line to get in. 

I will start with the waitress we had. Very friendly and knew the menu. Able to suggest drinks and dishes. My drink was a champagne cocktail. A bit sweet but not bad. We got those rather quickly.  The main issue we had was with the food.

My date ordered a burger which was on the menu and I ordered a cutting board platter with duck and some cheeses/ fruit that is meant as an appetizer and sounded perfect since I'm not a big eater. 

Since it is an open place you are able to see right in the kitchen. They had plates that my date and I watched sit under a heat lamp for 15 to 20 minutes. I don't mind waiting for food, but I do mind if it has been sitting under a heat lamp longer than a Big Mac, especially since these are \"gourmet\" prices!!!

We questioned where our food was a few times, hoping it wasn't one of the MANY plates sitting around. We were told it would be up any minute for 20 minutes. When it finally came out, my duck was COLD and all dried out. My date cut into his burger and touched the middle. Cold. Like been at the morgue rotting cold. The fries were also cold. Not luke warm... Cold. 

We sent the food back untouched. Which was hard for us to do since we had worked up an appetite by watching a galley full of food for an hour... However, not going to subject ourselves to mediocre food with a potential gastrointestinal flare up!!!

The waitress had the manager come out to ask if we wanted something else. We declined based on time and not wanting a repeat. He was noticeably pissed that we declined the offer and said that they are running 12 minutes from ticket to table (ummm your freakin clock is busted boss...or you are forgetting to include the 15 minute wait time on the sun lamp from hell block). So, after his rudeness and unapologetic attitude, we decided then to never return and make sure to let our friends know about the experience. We ended up heading to B-dubs and had a much better experience there.

On a side note... We sat by a bunch of other people (cell mates?) who were all complaining of the same issue.

I hope they can turn this around or there will be one less place in Kent."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and a beer after a long day at the office. Their menu looked good. It listed probably 40 beers and half a dozen different burgers. 

When the waitress came over she said they were out of a few items. She brought us an updated beer list. It only listed 5 beers. They were also out of Kobe beef, bison, and bacon. So they could only prepare about half of the burgers on their menu. 

Seriously how does a bar run out of bacon and beer?"}
{"text":"We were in town for a show and stopped in for lunch. Wednesdays are $5 stack your own burgers - freakin delicious and so big you can barely fit it in your mouth - vegetarian friendly options too. I also enjoyed two $5 Cookies and Cream martinis. Staff was prompt, friendly, and courteous, with the exception of a server mistakenly greeting my long-haired husband and I as \"ladies\" but she quickly caught herself an apologized. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Except for people with babies. There were babies crying in the bar. That was unnecessary."}
{"text":"Good food super slow service. Took advantage of the build your own burger (love this!) but during the dining experience I noted it taking longer than normal for our food come out that said I witnessed two guest waiting for their food much longer, One couple had been waiting well over an hour their meal was taken care of due to the wait. Improve the speed of service please!"}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in here for a burger after the Kent Wine & Music Fest on a Saturday evening around 7:30 pm.  Wanted an outdoor table and only waited about ten minutes.  The place was not full, nor as busy as we expected.  
Bottom line, our service was awful, food took forever (almost an hour) to come out after we ordered, then we still had no napkins or silverware.  Couldn't get a water refill to save our lives, and when we questioned the waitress on our food delay she said the kitchen had been backed up all day.  My burger was charred and crispy too & bottom, and everyone's truffle fries were soggy and cold.
Not sure we'll rush back to this place... they never even offered to cut us a break on the check for our inconvenience."}
{"text":"I'm a Bar 145 junkie!! Best burgers (and French fries!!) around, and every bit as good as B Spot.  The atmosphere is cool and fun :) It's my favorite place to hang out with friends and bring out of town company.  I'm a little surprised at some of these crabby reviews on here... I've been at least 4 times: service has been attentive and helpful; the management is friendly; the bands are awesome. They're a brand new restaurant/bar and they are always slammed...cut 'em some slack. It's the best place going in Kent!!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but you wait an excessively long time for a drink. I waited over 25 minutes for a drink while they served their friends free drinks. If you're looking for drinks go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I typically try not to be negative but my last few experiences here have earned this low review. I've noticed the service and quality of food has took a turn for the worse overtime. Tonight, we received our appetizer before our drinks (including water) and the cheese with our pretzel bites was cold. We had to remind our server 3 times for waters (after receiving our beers). Our server said they had no build your own burger notebooks left, they did (could see it on other tables). We received our burgers over an hour later (to be fair, the tables around us did as well) without the truffle fries. We were told our fries were coming right away, they never did. I have worked in restaurants before so I understand flukes and being crazy busy, Bar 145 was no where close to busy. Unfortunately, the restaurant lost return customers from tonight. I hope it turns around soon though!"}
{"text":"Do not eat at this restaurant. We waited 15 minutes to be told they were out of white wine. They had no Corona so we had to wait a little while longer for that. Our waiter it was in the kitchen texting the entire time. Took 20 minutes to get drinks. We finally got to order and the food came out 40 minutes later and the burger was so well done they could've used it in the Stanley Cup. We sent the burger back and waited 20 minutes while the waiter continued to sit in the kitchen and text on his phone. We were wondering if he was trying to get a new job at a different restaurant because the restaurant is going out of business. When I asked about the burger 20 minutes later he said oh would you like it to go. I said no we would like to go. Do not go t Bar 145 unless you have an hour and 45 minutes to sit around and get the wrong food."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow. Sat at bar for 10 minutes before being served. Another 40 minutes for a forgettable burger. Beer selection is terrible. Buffalo Wild Wings is better than this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, this is exactly what this town needed!!  
I do warn those who go, its a hotspot so there will be a wait, and school wasn't even in session!  The phone number that called me to tell me my table was ready was not a Kent or even North East Ohio area phone number so this is not a good time to screen your calls.  I got the black bean panini which was honestly the best black been burger/sandwiches I have ever had.  The truffle fries were a great compliment to the meal and the roasted red pepper aoli was addicting to say the least. My boyfriend got the meat loaf and sucked it down so fast i only got to try a small piece, it was really really good.  My sister got the Brussel sprouts which were so good she refused to share.  I recommend this place to anyone in the area.  It is a fairly limited menu, so if you do not like burgers, you will have a very small offering to choose from."}
{"text":"Hard to believe but when we went to dinner there last night, the place had three beers on tap and maybe 5 types of bottled beer!  These guys have several dozen taps and all but three were dry. The very few beers they did have were generic swill like B.L., Miller, etc. Whoever heard of a bar in a college town being out of beer on a Friday night? The very kind waitress was apologetic but said the situation had been like that for two weeks! It looked like their liquor supply was also seriously depleted as well. I'm guessing that this place may be about to close, and it might as well if that's how they stock and run the place."}
{"text":"Excellent place, good food, drinks, and general atmosphere. The main guy Ricky is really cute."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Had the Americana burger with truffle fries. Good classic burger for a great price. Drinks were cheap too. They weren't very strong, but I'd give them an average rating. Not bad for what we paid. Waitress was really chill and friendly. Only in town for a week and she was really helpful with places to go in town."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and although we got a seat quickly the service wasn't the greatest. We ordered appetizers and it took over 45 minutes for them to get out and one of the items was cold. Took longer than usual for our food. Probably a good place to just come to drink if you don't mind screaming in the ear off the person next to you. Not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"I gave Bar 145 another chance after three years, and they disappointed me. We ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, the Flirtini martini, and the pretzel bites with \"cheese fondue\". Every item was disappointing. 

The Pinot Grigio was ice cold - undrinkable for the first 5 minutes. My cocktail was supposed to have a champagne float...no bubbly to be found. And the pretzel bites were sliced frozen pretzel with a side cheez-whiz. I'm sorry, cheez-whiz is NOT a substitute for fondue. 

I feel bad for the server, because Lauren was great. But when you have to tell your tables that \"the kitchen is running behind\" at 8:30 on a Monday and it's empty inside, there are problems that need to be addressed. Despite the attractive patio space, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. Had a group of 12 and called ahead today for an employee anniversary lunch. After waiting an hour and still not having our food, I thought we may be celebrating next years anniversary there also!  Had to put more coins in the meter as an hour was not long enough.  We finally got our good after about an hour and fifteen minutes. I am not sure if they have a manager as we never saw anyone who remotely apologized. I can only imagine if the place had been full!!!!  If you do go there, be forewarned that you may have birthdays that you need to celebrate there due to the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated, waited 10 minutes and then gave up and left. Place was pretty empty at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon with plenty of staff standing around. Guess they weren't interested in doing their job. No one even seemed to notice that we walked out. Won't bother trying again."}
{"text":"Bar 145 brings the feel of a sleek, clean, hip gastro pub to revitalized downtown Kent.  Out of all the different bars and brewpubs lining Kent's main streets and back alleys, this might be  the one you will want to go to the most, if big city aesthetics are your guiding light.  

My fear after two visits, however, is that Bar 145, when it comes down to it, may be more \"look\" and \"feel\" than substance.   The menu is spirited and adventuresome, promising experimental hipster food delights such as burgers with waffles as buns. Executional flaws, however, are abundant, beginning with the underwhelming Monte Cristo burger, which came on untoasted Wonder Bread.  The promising \"seasonal fruit preserve\" advertised in the description, meanwhile, amounted to what looked like Smucker's jelly plopped on top - yes, you heard me - on top of the burger, on the outside of the \"bun.\"  How, I wondered, might one go about picking up such a burger, without smearing their hands with sticky jelly? 

The cobb salad I had on my second visit was an unconditional disappointment.  Cobb salads, in my experience, have always been A) pleasant to look at and B) hearty and satisfying.  Harking back to the old Wolfgang Puck restaurants, when I think of a cobb salad, I imagine orderly rows of colorful avocado, tomato, bleu cheese, bacon, hard boiled egg, and the like, sitting atop crisp, just-washed romaine.  Even in so-called \"tossed\" versions, cobb salads are all about a density of flavorful ingredients packed so tightly that each forkful promises a bit of everything.  The 145 version, I regretfully report, underwhelms in both presentation and substance.  My salad was almost all lettuce, with a few pieces of bacon and avocado here and there thrown in haphazardly, almost as if it were a garnish. The cheese, meanwhile, was a shredded Sysco-grade cheddar, sprinkled on the top as if an afterthought, ruining my visions of piles of cubed, sharp, tangy Tillamook that would have given the salad some badly needed character.

Bar 145 is a nice place to have a beer and watch a game, but its food menu feels more like that great-on-paper sports team that flops when it comes to actual performance."}
{"text":"I typically enjoy 145 depending on the entertainment; however, charging people for water is completely greedy, irresponsible, and dangerous. If I spend money on 2 or 3 drinks, you can pour me a water. You should want your patrons drinking water. Otherwise, you better stock up on mop heads. Also, you need more than 3 or 4 bartenders on New Year's Eve. The bartenders were working their asses off, but there's no way they could keep up with the crowd. Whoever's running the place is clearly cheap."}
{"text":"Food is always good. The service iffy at best.  Waited way too long for just a couple drinks. Then the bartender forgot to get the drinks.  The topper was that it wasn't even busy.  I'd say 10 tables and 5 servers."}
{"text":"Have had some really bad experiences here as well as some good experiences. Guess it depends on the night. What's usually disappointing is that what I want is usually unavailable when I am there, since when it runs out its gone. So, either it am not getting the bun I want, appetizer, wine, or side. Kind of annoying when that's the reason you go there craving a certain item. Also, they no longer sell those delicious onion petal thingies anymore. I LOVED those! :( Bummer. Been there several times when it hasn't been busy and you tend to get seated near the door rather than the other side of the room. Which is where most of the seating is..When it's cold out (pretty much all year in Ohio, ha) the air makes it really uncomfortable to sit there. Have to ask to be seated anywhere else a lot. ...  seems like drinks change in price by the night too. Been there for dinner and paid less than $5 for a gin and juice, was there at midnight and paid almost $8 fo a gin and juice.  Wtf?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Service was awful. Food was over priced and awful. No attention to detail. We ordered calamari appetizer there were a handful calamari at best , some over cooked peppers and some shitty sauce all for the price of $10. This place blows. Stay away and go spend your money somewhere else"}
{"text":"Always and awesome time when the bands and DJs come out at night. The staff is always friendly and I have yet to have a bad experience with food as well. The sauce for the fries and burgers is a must try. So good."}
{"text":"I'm going with 5 stars. The food came out fast and the bleu burger with bone marrow cheese was awesome. Drinks were a little harder to get but all in all a very pleasant experience.
Cute waitresses and live music on the patio. Beers are a bit pricey, $5 for a sierra nevada. They are $4 a block over. But the food rocks. Truffle fries were excellent. Crisp and hot with that unmistakable undertone of truffle oil.
Will try to go back but there is not much on the menu for the gf."}
{"text":"Constantly out of something. Anything you could want, they're out. Beer lost is sub par. Service is awful. If someone could point out a positive to this bar, I'd be shocked."}
{"text":"Ate here this past week.  I had a bacon cheeseburger which was delicious.  The hostess talked my wife into one of their new menu items, a flatbread with apples and cheese and jam.  She didn't like it.  This place has an apple fetish (as you'll see when you peruse the menu).  Anyhow, I'd go back for a traditional burger but would steer clear of the foo foo items. One annoyance; my wife had to return the first beer she ordered because the glass smelled like cleaning solution.  The waiter did bring her another beer and took $1 off the price which was nice."}
{"text":"Shittiest service ever, we have been waiting for longer than an hour and our food has not arrived. Never checked to refill our drinks. Never stopped at our table without one of us trying to stop them to TALK to us ( NOT to serve us! )

It's not my first visit and it will be my last, they have always been unwelcoming!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. We decided to try Bar 145 on a Tuesday because they had a \"kids eat free\" special and it will not be our last Tues. there! It was only 5pm so it wasn't crowded at all so we were sat quickly. Our waiter came over and was super friendly, informative and attentive the whole night. He actually said he had tasted everything on the menu and could answer any questions we had about what anything might taste like.  I had the soup of the day (turkey, cheesy something) and the poutine fries with duck confit...OMG. So good and sooooo rich. My husband had the Simpleton burger and asked for it med. rare and it was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful! The waiter also mentioned that they make everything in house including the bacon on the burger, which was thick and a bit unusual, but also good. The happiest surprise of the night was when my kids ordered their own dinner they both picked chicken strips, they too were house made, not frozen!!! Awesome, since I loathe frozen chicken \"nuggets\"! They also had a magician roaming around and my girls LOVED the tricks. 

I sound like a plant, but I really loved how we were so impressed with every aspect of the restaurant and really will be back soon (cuz I want a burger!!)."}
{"text":"Well worth a visit! Has lots of bourbon to choose from. For dinner we had the bourbon mac n cheese and the truffle fries to start... DELICIOUS!  As for our burgers I had the Balsamic Blue which I thoroughly enjoyed and my BF had the apple pie burger (he LOVED it and couldn't stop raving about it). Service was lovely and live music was great."}
{"text":"It hurt me to only give three stars, really, it did. I used to love this place a few years ago but the past three times I've been we have left disappointed. However let me start with the good. 

Unique place-like the white China-red chucks theme, Thats cute! The build your own burger option is nice, Mac & cheese is great, staff is friendly sometimes, cool location in Kent, they can cook a burger to the right temp most of the time too! The sauce with the fries-YUM!! :) 

Last few times the biggest problem has been the limitations on the menu and inability to substitute. People flat out don't like certain things and to force them to \"build their own\" just to remove a tomato becomes frustrating cause it becomes almost double the price once you get your side separately. If I'd known you would have charged me that way, I would have just taken the tomato off myself! Not cool. Wouldn't even adjust the bill afterward, argued with my group of over 10 and we all left annoyed. Not cool x2. Secondly-they were out of so many items. I don't mean one or two...three different food items and almost every beer on draft listed on the menu, literally. Bummer. 

I won't give up on this place-I'll be back. Hoping they get it together like when they first opened, this was a cool place to bring people and food can be killer!"}
{"text":"The best time to go is when there is a live band, that is always a great time. The few times that I have actually eaten there, the food took a long time to come out, but was good once I got it. I more so suggest this place for the bar and entertainment than for dinner."}
{"text":"Came back this past Saturday for some food. Glad we did! I did the build your own burger and actually made it a chicken sandwich with foccacia bun, spinach, smoked Gouda, citrus mayo, and pickled red onion and it was AWESOME! I also really enjoy their truffle fries. They're unique and tasty. 

To drink, I had the Texan Truce (on their cocktail menu) and it was sour! I liked it but unless you really like pineapple and lemon, I'd try something else."}
{"text":"What bar doesn't have Coors light? Did not have it in bottle or draft. Tried a Bud light draft it tasted sour as h.... It's a bar, Coors light is a beer, very popular one at that. Got red wine instead, not too huge on that. When trying to decide which one, the bartender gives me a funny face like she was in a hurry or annoyed. Got the wine anyway and at the end of it, tastes nothing but cork. Learn how to open a bottle of wine and manage the bar better. This all happened at opening not the end of the night."}
{"text":"Terrible service! My burger was very burnt. Got our appetizers with our meal. Had to ask a different server for silverware and our check after waiting 30-45 mins after we had finished eating. Definitely would recommend to go somewhere else when choosing where to eat."}
{"text":"The food and staff are way too inconsistent. Sometimes an appetizer is barely enough for 1 person and the next time you get that same appetizer it may be enough for 4 people. Same with prep and quality - it varies greatly. After about 6 visits with at least a dozen different people I've given up on Bar 145."}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally stop in here one night for dinner and drinks.  The Simpleton Burger was absolutely fantastic and delicious.  

Unfortunately the drinks were the big let down and very watered down.  Ordered a Manhattan and a dirty martini - just awful!  

Maaaaybe I'll stop back again and stick with beer. maybe."}
{"text":"First day of class and this place is out of every draft beer. Are you serious....????

Just tried to pop in for a quick beer before the hoops game and there are bags in all the taps....?????

Side note our bartender was great! I felt bad for her...."}
{"text":"This place is a awesome! The food is very good. The bartenders are very nice and on point. Weekends there are always great bands playing. The fireplace on the patio is perfect for chilly nights. Definitely recommend coming here if your out with friends for the evening and dinner. The only thing I can complain about is the women's bathroom can get kind of gross and low on tp or paper towels on busy nights."}
{"text":"The Yelpers are correct...the truffle fries are amazing. However the portions are very small for the price. The kids menu burger is really just one slider so again not a great value. It's in the heart of the new district in Kent so kids were probably an afterthought...they do have a kids special one week night. However didn't impress us enough to make a return trip."}
{"text":"Time- Between lunch and dinner, not busy at all. I want to rate my experience 0 stars. To start we were brought to an outside table which was to be cleaned- it had fries wedged in the metal table. Bad try! Seated by what I thought might be a male Mgr. He overlooked the fries. Probably didn't even spray it off with cleaner!:( wtf!!! We waited over 30 mins for someone to come to the table. Another waitress walked by us 4 times - zero- didn't even say hi- someone will be with you soon... nothing! To concerned about the tips from her big table.. I understand we probably weren't going to be her table but 30 mins went by before she told another some other girl we were there. Uneceptable business practices. Training is lacking, and apparently  we weren't the only ones to notice this recently based on other reviews. This was a good good place, new to area but like many suffer as time goes on. This is the decline of your business and soon I look forward to the next business in this spot. 
Service- F
The Food-
Not at all as good as in the past, crappy bread with veg. Burger 80/20 ratio , bread to burger- , fries were Luke warm to cool.beans sucked, seemed all was left over from the lunch rush and all the help went home... The food was just over shadowed by the shitty service.  It's a holiday weekend !, didn't think you might be busy??an hour and a 1/2 all total for a non busy time , unbelievable , u all need help!

Food - D
Over all - we'll never be back , nor will the ten plus people I tell about this experience . 
 Lastly it's customer service, without it you have none..."}
{"text":"Haven't had the food yet, but the nightlife is great! Been here twice for drinks and dancing, and I love it!  There was a band there both times, and both were great.  Great alternative to 157 Lounge for dancing.  Especially if you aren't into house or techno music.  Such a great addition to College Town Kent!!"}
{"text":"The drinks get 5 stars, And the food...the food should get 5, but it's so hit or miss. The menu is gorgeous, and the things on it look delicious. However, I've had less than great luck with both service and quality. For example: pretzel bun-AWESOME. burger that came on it-meh. And it took about an hour from the time we walked in to receive it. 
Lunch/brunch food has been great, dinner has been hit or miss, but mostly miss. I keep coming, so it's obviously okay. :)
Drinks, again, are AMAZEBALLS."}
{"text":"I've had mostly good experiences here, and one bad one. The first several times were nothing but positive. I agree that the service can be slow, but generally, I don't have to dine quickly, so I don't mind. The food is nothing amazing, but good -- build-a-burger is cool, although the options list is overkill. The caesar with salmon is nice. The poutine fries are good, although there's way too much sauce and it drowns the fries at the bottom. The bourbon list is excellent, and they make quite a few nice bourbon cocktails. In fact, I've talked up the cocktails to some friends, and went with a group last night so we could try them. I'm sorry to say, we were disappointed.

Our first round did not taste like bourbon at all. It tasted like lemonade. I thought it was an honest mistake, so I mentioned it to the bartender. At first she apologized, but after the person who served us insisted that she had made the drink normally, I was informed that since I'd drunk some, I'd have to pay for it. First of all, I never asked not to pay for it. Second, I've had that drink maybe 5 times and it has always tasted deliciously like bourbon. This time it just didn't. I dropped the issue and watched them make my second -- it was a miserable half shot of bourbon drowned in lemonade from the soda gun. Nevermind the rest of the ingredients in the cocktail.

I'm not sure what happened. It was a loud, crowded Saturday night. Perhaps they make a simpler version of the drink when it's crowded. And yet it costs the same. Really disappointing.

I'm guessing this was just an off-night. I've been quite pleased during my other trips, so chances are you will be too."}
{"text":"Overall its a good restaurant with an exciting menu. Some items are very overpriced. 

They push the whole 145 Degrees theme a bit too much for me, especially since they have lots of burgers and I would say Medium Rare is not the optimum cooking temperature for ground meats (not talking safety, just enjoyability). That's personal preference. The other thing is order accuracy.

They are so used to cooking everything to 145 it seems, that when I asked for a burger cooked Medium rather than Medium Rare, it came out well done and dry. I figured they were just trying to fit their name-profile then and like me, considered 145 degrees to little for a burger - so they effectively cooked medium rare as medium and medium as well done. So, the next time I ordered my burger medium rare, and it came out medium rare (and to me, gross). So, its just pure inconsistency. They were glad to refire my burger patty a bit more that second time though.

I enjoyed the bone marrow appetizer, but for literally one leg bone section (they say two because its cut in half to access the marrow), its really overpriced.

The cocktails are great, if not accurate to name (as the bar has an obvious Bourbon theme there is Bourbon in all of their cocktails -- even cocktails which contain no Bourbon traditionally). I think the cocktails could be more specific in their names to correct for that (e.g. Bourbon Mojito instead of Mojito) they do specifically list the ingredients though so you do know what you're getting, but if its the first Mojito someone has had they might incorrectly draw from that that Bourbon is the traditional spirit in Mojitos, which obviously it is not. They taste great though.

TLDR - good food, some inconsistency in their meat doneness and slightly overpriced on some items. Its a nice place to go eat though."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Monday afternoon for some drinks and a snack, the place seemed nice to us.  We went to order a drink,  most of the draft beer we wanted were either changed or not available.  The current list of beers was out dated and useless.  We than tried to order a martini but the bartender said they were out of vodka.  Not out of the vodka that we wanted but out of all vodka.   Don't think we are going back."}
{"text":"VERY slow service for early on a Friday night. Meager draft beer selection for a bar. Out of some bottles. Out of TEA even. 

Took almost 10 min to get a beer. Ordered my food when the beer came and its over 20 minutes and still haven't gotten it. Server hasn't updated us on the status either. 

Owner or manager actually came over because he saw us checking out watches... looks like he's checking on it. Server couldn't care less. She's asked us 4 times how everything is.. ummm it sucks.  No food yet!  Duh!! 

Got the burger.. 30 min wait. supposed to be medium and it was dripping blood. Had to send it back. 

Offered us a discount on the meal which is fine. Won't come back here again I'm sure. And my kid is only a freshman at Kent, so there was three more years of opportunities for them. Gone."}
{"text":"I almost rated this place 2 stars. The atmosphere is nice and so are the staff...as far as burgers though - I'd rather eat a whopper jr. Honestly. Nothing about my burger was satisfying...it was cold and lacked flavor. I struggled to eat it because I don't waste food, especially meat. Brioche bun sucked, tomatoes an pickles were terrible. Definitely will never order a burger here again. Not even worth $5."}
{"text":"I went to Bar 145 to grab dinner during a night out with one of my friends. I've been here before for bands and drinks later at night, but had never tried the food here. I enjoyed coming here for the nightlife since it's one of the places in Kent where your not part of the young college crowd. 

However, for the food and service it was just okay.
Food- I ordered the Veggie Black Bean Burger. It was served on bread (instead of a bun) as a stacked sandwich and just had WAY too much bread with it. I had the fries with it and the dipping sauce for the fries was so good. The burger was pretty decent. I know my friend had a bad experience with the tacos she ordered. 
Drinks- Their martinis are very good here! I got the Flirtini which is great (a little more expensive though). 

Overall they have a very large menu that seems to appeal to many different tastes. I think it is a good spot for a group, I just don't think the food is anything extraordinary. It's also a fun place to hang out at the bar."}
{"text":"When this establishment first opened their dining experience was outstanding. Interesting, food with some locally sourced ingredients; good service and an interesting environment.

Now? I cannot recommend Bar 145 at all.

The service is horrible. Staff are slow, indifferent and are not well versed on the menu or drinks.

Often, they are out of ingredients. They serve drinks from mismatched glassware. The place isn't very clean. Just not a pleasant experience.

Stay away. There are far better eateries in Kent to get a good burger with better service."}
{"text":"Open area, really impressive cocktail menu, food is delicious.  Beers and chilled wine for the patio. Live music and daily specials. Great new bar in the Kent area."}
{"text":"Our waitress Brianna was the worst!! She gave all her attention to the tables where her friends were dining and consistently walked by our table as if she didn't see us. We had to flag her down to ask about the status of our order. That's when she noticed our food order was ready in the kitchen. The food was not hot and over done.

Probably great place for drinking. Not so much for grabbing something to eat."}
{"text":"I haven't hit up the bar 145 for live music yet, but I hear that its always a good time. Went in for dinner to try a new place a couple of weekends ago and had a kobe burger and my date had some wings and a patty melt. The food was good, service a little slow but they were busy from some downtown festivities. Nice place for a burger and fries but didn't seem to have much more than that for an entree. Large drink selection, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The tempura green beans I got were great! But I ordered a Shirley temple, seeing as I am underage, and the waitress asked me if I wanted vodka put in it. A Shirley temple was made for the reason that Shirley temple was too young to drink... This lack of common knowledge perplexed me a bit. Also the lack of fabric to absorb sound created a very loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I think there might be a chance that it will be better than the time before, and every time I am disappointed. After the first time I wasn't all that impressed - the burger choices were fun and different but my \"medium\" burger came out well done, and the service was slow, with the excuse that the kitchen was backed up. All right, one bad night doesn't condemn the place for good. So when friends suggested the place the next few times, I hoped it would be better but it just wasn't. Again, burgers were way overcooked and service was slow. I also ordered the 145 Manhattan which is supposed to be one of their specialty drinks, but it wasn't very good - it was crammed with a bunch of maraschino cherries an hardly any bourbon. The most recent time we went, when my husband and I came in to be seated, the hostess said that there was a 15-20 minute wait to just be seated, even though there were plenty of tables, because the kitchen was so backed up. Then when we finally were seated it took 20 minutes just to get drinks. Overall, not worth paying the ridiculous prices they ask for with the poor service and mediocre food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've never had a burger as good as the one I've had here. Love this place, the Simpleton is my favorite."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences with Bar 145. Some good, some bad.  This was my email to Bar 145 after an evening there on Aug 6th 2014.  I've not received any kind of reply regarding my email, so I'll just assume that they took it for what it was worth and ignored it.  

---start email snippet---
...
It first started when we walked in and the hostess told us it would be a 30 minute wait. OK. I'm cool with that, even though there are a bunch of tables that are open and clean, with no one sitting at them.  I gave her my cell number and waited outside.  30 minutes later, I go and check on our seating status. Now there's a 20 minute wait for a table. OK. I'm frustrated, but not to the point where I'm not going to wait for the burger I craved. Almost 20 minutes pass, my fiancée is getting anxious, hungry and thirsty. She goes in. The hostess tells her it will be another 20 minutes!

At this point I'm really irritated. If I was told upfront that I was going to have to wait an hour and 10 minutes, starting at 7:00PM, to get a table on a Wednesday night, I would have gone somewhere else from the beginning. 

We get a phone call about 10 minutes after my fiancée had talked to the hostess. Hostess takes us over to a table. It's dirty. She grabs a rag and wipes it off. So we're an hour in, and we're hungry and tired of waiting. Waitress comes over, takes our drink order, and returns with them fairly promptly. Good. We finally feel like we're going to be able to salvage the night with a nice juicy burger. 

Waitress comes back after a bit, grabs the Build-a-Burger sheets, takes my fiancée's order for a drink, and puts them into the computer. Now the waiting game starts. 5,10,15 minutes pass... No drink.  No waitress. She's so busy handling her 6-8 other tables she doesn't even come check on us. Finally my fiancée flags her down. Waitress apologizes and explains that the bar printer went offline for a bit and the drink may have gotten lost in the shuffle. OK. 5 minutes later, we have a martini on the table.

More waiting. Lots of watching the 4 members of the kitchen staff struggle to keep up with the incoming tidal wave of burger orders.  About a half hour later we have food, roughly 40 minutes after we placed our order. Her burger was supposed to be \"145\" and its more like medium well. Mine was supposed to be rare, and boy was it. I'm less upset about mine, as \"rare\" can be interpreted a few different ways, but I was a bit upset over her's being so cooked through. She likes her burgers like mine, just a little less rare. Waitress comes back to see how things turned out. I say \"OK\", and she says \"Great!\" and walks away before I can even say another word about my fiancée's over cooked burger. Yada yada yada, bill took to long to get because waitress is running 14 credits cards for 2 different tables, waiting to get my card back, card in hand, bill signed, now it's 10PM, 3 hours later, and all we really wanted was a decent burger that we didn't have to make at home.

I get it. It's $5 burger/martini night. It's going to draw a crowd and be super busy. I have been to Bar 145 during other Weds evenings, in fact that was the first and only other time we've been there. We had a party of 4, and I don't remember it being that ridiculously slow.

It continues on a bit, but our experience was captured above. We'll probably go back, but not anytime too soon."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had there yet. After waiting at the front door for someone to come seat us we were seated (by a person dressed as if they just walked in off the street and clearly not wearing the signature red chucks and black clothes) at a table near the kitchen and told that our server would be right with us.  After waiting about 10 minutes a person dressed like the dishwasher showed-up at the table and announced, rather awkwardly, that he was going to be our server.  It was clear that he was not a regular server as he took our order and collected our menus without asking if we wanted anything to drink which is kind of \"server 101\", right?  I mention this only to highlight the fact that they only had one server working the entire dining room. He brought me my Old Fashioned a few minutes later which turned out to be watered-down (literally).  This has been one of my pet peeves with this restaurant. They advertise themselves as \"a gastro pub specializing in burgers, bands, & bourbon\" but I've yet to have a well made bourbon drink.  In the past this issue was mitigated by the outstanding burgers.  This visit my disappointing drink was followed by a raw burger on a grocery store onion roll. I enjoy a medium burger and can even be convinced to eat a medium rare one upon occasion but this fell short of even rare. What happened to the great food they used to serve?  What has been one of my favorite Kent restaurants has deteriorated into a place that I won't be visiting again.

Kudos to whoever our server was.  Dishwasher or bartender, he did his best."}
{"text":"Food was very skimpy for the cost. Sandwich had practically nothing on it. Sent it back for a do over. Soup was good but again tiny cup. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Such great service! I ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffle iron was broken. Manager came out and was so nice, my meal was free and was just so generous. Incredible food, nice atmosphere. Perfect for hanging with friends and watching the big game"}
{"text":"Bar 145 is a really solid pub. The burgers are fantastic. The truffle fries rock. The fried green beans are awesome. The red chucks/white china in-your-face-ness of their image is a little phony and goofy, but hey, the food is great, and I've never had a complaint about their service either."}
{"text":"I visited the Kent location for the first time ever to see an old friend and the band playing that evening with the intent of eating and drinking.

The food was overpriced.  The word 'overpriced' is an understatement.  I bought one of the cheaper burgers for $11 with a small cup-full of fries.  I was unimpressed after watching the intro video about the 'quality' of the food on Bar 145's website. I've had better burgers at Wendy's, for cheaper.  The prices seemed ridiculous and didn't match the quality. Just another example of a bar trying to pass off regular bar food as gourmet.

The bartenders' were usually socializing among themselves and not really paying attention to the patrons.  When I and others asked them questions about the beer selection and what not they didn't seem to have the answers upfront.  I remember asking at one point for a tall draft and instead got a regular-sized glass without any explanation or sign of regret.

The biggest reason why I'm writing this review is I had ONE tab going which when I cashed out was $35.54.  I reluctantly tipped ($5) and signed and that was the end of it.  I checked my bank account the following Saturday evening and discovered that another tab had been started and closed out for $25.  It appeared as though the bartenders' somehow charged drinks and/or shots to me on a separate tab, without my knowledge or permission.  I never signed a second tab, let alone knew about it.

I left a negative rating on their FB page Sunday and they responded asking me why I left the bad rating, so I told them exactly what happened, and I told them I'd gladly rescind the review if they refunded me the $25 in question.  It's been two days and no reply.  They cared just enough to ask me what was wrong and did nothing to correct the situation. Not even an apology.

DON'T go to Bar 145 unless you want to risk losing more money than you were trying to spend.  And eat sub-par food for twice what it's worth.  It's a whole lot of flash and pizazz and not much else.

UPDATE: Apparently the bartenders' are thieves as well. Checked my bank account again this morning and the updated total on the tab I signed for was $43.34.  When I wrote in a tip that night it was for $5.  How did an extra $2.80 get added to the tip amount?  They were lucky they even got a tip at all after the poor service.  Pretty sure it's against the law to tamper with someone's bill like that."}
{"text":"They don't have 6 stars so I had to settle at 5.    We have eaten here twice and the Burgers are great and the service is excellent as well.  Good beer choices on tap in addition to the many many bourbon options.  I recommend asking what the burger of the day is.  Both times I have had the special and it was great.   The truffle fries are quite good as well.  We will make many more return trips to sample the various burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is good when it's warm not cold. Waited over a half hour for drinks from the bar. Sent back the French Onion soup to be warmed up. The kitchen decided to throw it away and give us new ones.  Well, then they didnt have any more soup fort the night.  The soup and entree came out at the same time. Everything was cold. Everything seemed disorganized. They were bringing food out to the wrong tables. Our table had 2 servers at first (a lot of good that did).  Before I go back there I'll eat at one of the other 10 new restaurants or just go to Bob Evan's down the street."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great addition to Kent!  We had a party of three and went on Saturday around 4pm and we were seated immediately.  The waitress was very helpful with the menu and our food came out quickly.  I made my own burger and it was fantastic!  If you're going to build your own burger, I definitely recommend the red pepper aioli and pesto sauce mixed together.  I love this place, because instead of getting buns you can get lettuce buns.  The truffle fries are a must!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers.  I always get it with a fried egg on top.  I enjoy the truffle fries too.  Only draw back is that it is pricey.  Two burgers, with tip, was $31."}
{"text":"Traveling through the area, avid yelper and had all intentions on stopping at Ray's Place for dinner and a beer. There happened to be a Wine & Arts festival going on, so needless to say, Ray's had an hour wait. Decided to venture on and stumbled across this bar. From the outside it looked super promising. Had bar seating, looked nice inside and the Hockey Playoffs were on, how could we go wrong? Well, anything and everything was horrible. Ordered 'onion rings' to start because at this point we were starving. Unsure if the bartender forgot to put them in or the kitchen legit took 40 minutes to batter onion straws and throw them on a plate. And that's exactly how they came out. They were super sweet and I definitely don't recommend them. At all. 

So after the appetizer took that long, we figured we had better put in the actual food order. We went simple, wings and mac and cheese. Didn't take as long to get to us which was good, however, the food was terrible. I love spice, so we shared the spicy buffalo wings. They were very fatty and also had this sweet taste that we experienced with the 'onion rings'. Assuming it's the batter they use. Also, the mac and cheese (with bacon) was super bland. Maybe we just didn't get the 'best' items on the menu but I can assure you we won't be returning to try anything else. 

So it's not all negative, the service was okay. Bartenders were friendly! And for that, they get one star."}
{"text":"This place was almost mediocre but some how managed to screw up a tossed salad. To my own discredit I did not get a burger which people later told me was the only thing worth getting here"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you want a great burger and terrible, incredibly slow service! 

The last few times I've been here, service was sub par but the most recent includes being thrown a rag to wipe down the bar top ourselves since our server's arms were \"too short\" to do that from where she was standing. Our server at the bar was downright lackadaisical.

I like their food and the patio and bar are fun spaces but I'm going to have difficulty being convinced to return. There are other burger options in Kent with much better, more attentive service."}
{"text":"Could not order a burger because they where out of patties. We sat there for over 15 minutes before they told us"}
{"text":"The veggie burger is absolutely amazing- the best I have EVER had! The truffle fries are amazing as well. Trivia night is Monday and a lot of fun. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim because my boyfriend is a huge bourbon drinker. The service was amazing! The waiter we had was extremely knowledgeable about all the bourbons and food options. The food itself was awesome. We had the warm Bavarian pretzel bites to start and each designed our own sandwiches. Let me tell you, the possibilities are endless!  I had marinated chicken on brioche with provolone, jalapenos, arugula, bacon, and the sweet chili sauce. Will definitely go here again and again to try more combinations.  Oh, and the truffle fries? They are the oh-so-tasty icing on this cake of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I just came back to Kent for a visit and boy how it has changed! I saw this place, its outdoor seating & its clearly (attempting to be) trendy atmosphere and I wanted to try it out. 

This place is packaged nicely but I was not impressed with much beyond that.  We went in the afternoon and there was NOBODY there, I mean it was Kent in the dead of summer.  The waitress/bartender was clearly annoyed that we took a long time to decide on drinks (you know because she was busy waiting on the 4 other people in the WHOLE place). At this point I was like meh whatever this food is going to be awesome, and the drinks will probably be decent.

The waitress/bartender (lets err on the side of waitress that happened to be behind a bar) offered to make me a mojito when I was having trouble deciding, so I went with that.  Poor choice on my part.  The scintilla slice of lime she put in the drink had cleaaaarrrly been cut days before, seriously days, it was a greenish brown color, and the drink tasted like watered down sprite.  Basically not a place to order off menu drinks.  Whatever, bad drinks don't scare me! We soldiered on waiting for good food.

My friend got the apple burger, and I made my own chicken sandwich.  Upon tasting the apple burger I was slapped in the face with cinnamon. Not just a little cinnamon. A sickening potpourri amount of cinnamon. There was nothing about it that was good, other than the patty, which could barely be tasted over the overwhelming cinnamon taste.  

I would describe my chicken sandwich (you can build any sandwich/burger yourself) as purely MEH.  The piece of chicken they used for the sandwich was much too big, which made it kind of hard to eat.  I got it on the brioche bread, which fell apart before bite 3.  I also got it with bacon which was an extra dollar. I would like my dollar back.  The bacon was undercooked and not even remotely crispy, it was grey and full of sadness.  Remove bacon eat rest of sandwich.  Leave half of sandwich there. The chicken died in vein.

For the price the quality of the waitstaff and crafting of the food should be better.  The only redeeming quality about this place was the outdoor seating.  I'd rather sit inside at Rays and eat a good burger though :D"}
{"text":"Went here and sat on the patio which was nice. Best way to describe it, some things were just ok and others were pretty good...problem is you dont know until you try. Best thing we had was the maple bacon mac n cheese. Worst was the calamari. Wed go back but know what to order and what not to."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to go in Kent after they opened, but the past year the service has really gone down hill. One time I timed how long it took to get drinks and it was just under 1 hour. Another time I moved an umbrella on the patio out of our faces to eat and they acted like I had stole all their umbrellas and then drove my car into the bar! I will not be returning and don't suggest anyone does unless you enjoy terrible service. Oh the food is not nearly as good as it used to be either."}
{"text":"I never finished writing this review and maybe it's pointless now that I see it has closed. I was there less than a week before they closed and we were one of three tables in the whole place. It was DEAD. And yet, even being that dead it still took almost an hour for our food to come out!

Our server was very nice and friendly, but we had to ask her a few times where our food was. She seemed very unphased. Still, nevertheless, we persisted. While most of our food was good when we got it, it wasn't all correct. For example, my dear friend's taco came with .. just the chicken. Nothing else. The menu even said it came with something else. How do I know? I walked from the patio through the restaurant trying to find an employee. I took myself to the host station and grabbed a menu. When we told the server she asked if we were sure (um, yes), then asked if they were ok. My friend had eaten the tacos - it had also been more than 30 minutes since they were dropped off before someone came back to check on us. I'm not trying to nit pick here but I was not a fantastic server and I did better than that. Had the place been slammed, I would be a bit more understanding. 

The truffle fries were amazing. Those I will miss. But basically nothing else."}
{"text":"Eye out the tables. Seating is first come first served. They have the Kentucky Bourbon Ale too! it gets crazy with drunk college kids after midnight but the live music tonight was worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I want to inform you of a VERY poor experience. The hostess was playing on her phone for a good minute before she acknowledged us- and we ended up watching several parties leave as no one would seat them and the restaurant was not busy at all!  We waited over an hour from ordering to service for three burgers that were prepared wrong. My coffee was cold but my waitress never returned to check on us until our food came out so I never even got the chance to ask for a warm cup. We asked for the manager on three separate occasions and finally I walked up to get him myself. \"Eric\" was rude and made excuses and kept repeating \"so what do you want, I can pay your bill\". I kept repeating we already paid and had no problem doing so, but the service was inexcusable. He then said \"well I'm confused because our longest ticket wait time was 29 minutes\", which felt like he was accusing us of lying. We paid and left, but will never return. Which is sad because I saw several other parties do the same. I also want to note I saw several other parties requesting the managers so I feel as if my experience was not isolated.  So sad because this was a good burger joint not so long ago. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Although we enjoy the food we have yet to come here and actually get what we ordered.  The kitchen is always out of several items and the poor wait staff has to make excuses.  Step it up Bar 145. Too many good restaurants in Kent now for your management to let the kitchen slide."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time until they hired a new bartender. She took forever to get our drink orders (even though it wasn't busy at all) because she was on the other side of the bar talking to her friends. When she finally came around, I ordered a Long Island and watched her fill the glass less than half with liquor and fill the rest with Coke. When I politely asked her to taste it because there didn't seem to be any alcohol in it, her response was, \"If you can taste it then I didn't do my job right\" and then walked away. I understand that Long Islands aren't supposed to taste like strong alcohol, but I watched her fill it with Coke! I had to pay $6 for something that should have been charged as just a regular mixed drink. Hope they get rid of her so I can start going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girlfriend for some beers and a snack. Ordered fried green beans, which where alright but they were covered with a strange orange sauce that reminded me of something you might find at a bad Chinese restaurant. Besides the strange green beans our beers came out in glasses that were so frosted we had chunks of ice floating in the beer.

Would not return to this place."}
{"text":"The food choices are quality. The restaurant is loud and the service is a bit chaotic, but this is a restaurant geared toward a younger, louder, collegiate crowd. At night it is more of a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"So, our visit to Bar 145 started out a bit rocky, but fortunately, was saved by our friendly server (Laura) and an apologetic manager (Dan). A couple of us are craft beer enthusiasts, and we were anxious to try out some of their seasonal selections on the beer menu. Unfortunately, the first 3 or 4 beers we ordered were no longer on tap. But, we finally found something to sample, and settled in to wait for our food. After some mix-ups in the kitchen, our food finally arrived an hour after we ordered. After all that anticipation, thank goodness the burger I had was fabulous, as was the Maple Bacon Mac side dish.  (Though, really.....could Maple Bacon Mac ever NOT be fabulous?!?!) And I highly recommend their option to build your own burger....they have some great topping choices, and you can even get it without the bun (for all you anti-carb freaks)....so here's the chance to build the burger of your dreams!!  Even given all our mishaps, I would definitely return....I'll just make sure I'm not in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Bar 145 for awhile now and I'm glad I did! The setting including the nice outdoor patio does not make me think of Kent which is nice (doesn't remind me of a college town) Staff was very helpful and friendly when trying to choose from the menu and gave great recommendations based on what they liked. The menu was limited so I ended up getting a black bean panini with truffle fries and a awesome simple sangria. The food looked and tasted great! Great experience and I look forward to tasting the lobster mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon with a 1 year old.  Yeah, we are those people that bring a baby who has just discovered her high pitched scream to a bar.  The staff was amazing, polite, attentive, just good solid service. My wife and I both built our own burgers.  Fresh ingredients, great food, cooked to perfection. Fantastic concept that will work well in the area. I was very appreciative of the fact that the staff took time to compliment us on our baby and were very engaged with her during our entire visit. If I were the managment I would pay attention to this detail and encourage it. Its part of the reason why we will now be regulars at this establishement."}
{"text":"I used to love Bar 145 when I first moved to Kent, but lately I feel like their quality of food had gone down hill so bad. Last time I ate here my food was cold, and I really don't like that they don't serve the fries in the basket thing anymore, and I feel like the new way the serve the fries on the plate they give you less fries then what you got before. The waitress and waiters are nice, but it sure if the cooks don't care about their job anymore, or if they honestly need better management."}
{"text":"Was hungry for some burgers and fries after visiting a wine festival in downtown Kent.  This place looked promising from the outside.  With a name like \"Bar 145\" I figured there would be great tap beer and delicious bar food to go along with it. 

I was wrong.  

When the waitress came to my table for the first time she asked me what I wanted to drink.  I didn't even have a menu. She quickly grabbed some for our table.  I wrote in my order on the cards they have at your table to build your own burger.  I asked for a burger cooked medium, plus all my other, usual fixings.  When our burgers came they were way beyond medium.  Instead, they were well done and even had a char crust on the outside.  I consider this flavorless by the way as the meat has lost all its juices and is dried out.  My truffle fries did not taste so bad, although I've had better at Flip Side, but were lukewarm and probably sat out for a few minutes while my burger overcooked.  My husband's burger buns were stale.  My son's chicken bites were pieces of fried chicken so dry they almost resembled jerky.  He did not eat them.  At some point we caught whiffs of burnt food smell coming from the kitchen too. We were seated right next to it.  Then, I asked for tap water.  Tasted like plastic.  Trust me, I drink tap water at restaurants all the time.  I am not picky but I did not finish the one here.

The bar in the middle of the restaurant looked cool but was dead.  During the middle of our lunch we watched a large group of people come in and sit down and peruse the menu, then they got up and left.  

I guess you know by now that I did not have a good experience at Bar 145.  I really wish I had checked the reviews before we walked in.  So if you are reading this, do yourself a favor and check out a different place."}
{"text":"Never again.  This place started out great when it opened, and it has been going down hill since.  Today, we were the first in at 11:45 am.  At 12:25 the waitress said that our ticket was never put in, because the printer was down.  While tables that came in after us were being served. Came back 10 minutes later and offered a free appetizer.  We just wanted our food.  
Finally at 12:45, an hour later we received our lunch.  My medium rare burger was medium well, no balsamic, the fries I ordered still hadn't arrived and the side of bacon my friend ordered did not arrive.  Not once did they ask to refill our beverages.  The manager came out and instead of apologizing, she said, I hear there's a problem...duh... she should have known the problem.  She said I will discount your lunch.  The bill came 25% off.  Big deal!  We all make mistakes, it's how you fix them that counts.  There are too many restaurants in Kent that run rings around this one.  Go to Bricco, Nineteen 10 at the hotel, Wild Goats, anywhere but here.  As I read the other recent reviews I see the manager has a hard time making things right.  Service is also a big issue as reflected in several reviews. Perhaps if you train your staff in the first place, you won't have to give 10% and 25% discounts on people's meals.  This place needs a secret diner to report back to the owners."}
{"text":"It's a bar with amazing food and drinks. Music almost every night so the vibe is great and upbeat. Build your own burger was fantastic with a side of brussels spouts salads and apps were perfect and not to expensive. Open air patio is a place in downtown kent."}
{"text":"Truly pleasant surprise in Kent. In a town where a cheap burger or burrito were some of the better dining options, it's nice to see this place elevating things a bit. It's a burger and beer joint, but they had creative options and some nods to haute cuisine (duck confit on the poutine, for example). OK beer selection. For a tiny chain, this still seems to be run with care. I'd happily go back."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!!!! Good food good booze and good service!!! Ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Balsamic Bleu Cheese Burger!!! I then ordered the Goose Island Rotating Vintage Ale which was Matilda I believe and it has a citrus flavor to it which made this experience overall satisfying.  My server Brandon helped me make that drink decision which really helped!! The food here has so much flavor with every bite which will have me coming back for more!!!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Bar 145 not only has spectacular appetizers, burgers, and beverages, but the atmosphere is a perfect setting near a college campus. Customizable burger toppings, there is a burger for everyone. We shared an appetizer of the deviled eggs, which I highly suggest for anyone who enjoys deviled eggs normally. The service was on par to their quality of food, they were efficient with their time. They have a wide variety of beers which is great for someone who enjoys small craft brews. They have live bands that play regularly, and created a fun and unique experience better than any bar in downtown Kent. I have been wanting to go back ever since I went the first time!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian so I was very nervous to come to a burger place. I was happy to see that they do offer a veggie burger but it truly wasn't that great. It was flattened out and completely broke apart after three bites (but don't they always). Make sure to go on wednesdays for $5 burgers but its only select ones. Not a bad place to eat, just not one of my favorites. Fries are great though!"}
{"text":"Misleading prices on their \"$5 specials\". Terrible service. Way better restaurants in Kent. Try Bricco or Troy Grille before heading here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband. pretty good food, with some tweaking could be great. Dressing on salad was tasty, but should be put on with a drizzle not a ladle full. Veggie burger was excellent. Simpleton burger could have been great if the meat had been rested after it was cooked so all the juice wouldn't have soaked the bottom bun so it couldn't be picked up since the bottom bun had dissolved to mush. Tempora Fried green beans good, would have been much better with a drizzle of sauce not a ladle full thus soaking the bottom beans and if they'd been fried a minute or 2 longer.

Will try again for dinner so we can test out some of their signature drinks. Very cool  interior, but you can't eat decor."}
{"text":"I went in there because they had a pretty good kids' menu, but was highly disappointed by the service.

The service and food was unacceptably slow, and while the food was good, it wasn't worth the wait.  I shouldn't have had to wait 30 minutes for a burger and a macaroni/fries.  I might have expected slow service if it was a Friday and the place was packed, but it's Tuesday and 1/3 full at best. 

If I do come back, I sure don't want to do it with a child (which means I probably won't come back)."}
{"text":"Delicious food, with great quality ingredients. I like to order the stack your own burger.. so many options!  Only 4 stars because the service is slow even when they aren't busy."}
{"text":"Decided to give this establishment a second try only to get slower service than the first time! 
Management was very nonchalant about the slow service and waitress literally brought our drinks and then avoided all eye contact with us never came back to check on us until our order had taken 35-45 minutes. Manager stated 30-40 minutes is standard for the burger and fries. I personally will not be back for a third time to spend this much time waiting on an average burger and fries!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible and I will never go back. I got 'the simpleton' which had an onion bun, cream cheese, bacon, onions. My $12 burger was bleeding (when I asked for well done). The bun was not toasted, which resulted in the burger becoming soggy very quickly. The bread didn't seem fresh, and overall the burger had no flavor.  They have an extremely limited menu."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food. There are flies everywhere and they just don't care if you have a good experience or not. You do better picking ANY other place!"}
{"text":"I first want to say that I really enjoy Bar 145 and when done right, the food is awesome. That being said, my last experience somewhat ruined it for me. Our server couldn't have been less personable. This is unlike any of our previous 15+ experiences. I ordered a custom burger using the paper sheet. When burger arrived...no cheese, no egg, no bacon, no sauce. It was a plain burger with the veggies and that's it! While my waistline probably prefers it that way, I find Bar 145 as my guilty pleasure and to not get what was ordered was disappointing. Especially since I wrote it down for the staff. No memory was needed. The server never apologized and I actually had to ask for the additions to be taken off of my check. Not sure we'll return with the abundance of craft burger joints in the area. The one thing I surely will miss is the maple bacon mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and lately the staff have been incredibly neglectful of their customers. I came in at a time that was not busy and the female bartender spent the first 12 minutes talking to friend co-workers about personal issues and playing with her hair instead of helping customers.  I almost walked out.  I found the staff to be unprofessional (except for the kitchen staff who worked very hard preparing meals that then went unattended by the wait staff). If I were a manager I would not permit cell phones, monitor activity or lack thereof and train my employees to be responsible and respectful.  For as much as it costs to have a burger and a drink, I do not think I will return.  They will receive a tip but not the 40% I give for when service is good."}
{"text":"If I could give one star I would DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This place will do nothing but disappoint and aggravate you. Thing is I really don't even think they even care, the manager who brought out the food that did not even arrive as described on the menu, picture cold not toasted white wonder bread as a bun for a veggie burger described as toasted red pepper bread. Sliders without the cheese and the meat just being a burger that was cut in quarters. The veggie burger was sent back and arrived back at the table with only the top of the white bread toasted... the manager did not even come over to check or acknowledge us at all. She was completely dismissive. This place will not be open long, if I owned this place I would be disgraced with this dismissive manager that clearly takes no pride in this place, it clearly shows in the rest of the wait staff as well."}
{"text":"Slow service.   Out of most things.  Just a matter of time till they default on the rent and someone else comes in..   like most of the new places that have flooded Kent.."}
{"text":"From an out-of-towner's perspective - best place in the Acorn Hill or whatever this little area is called in Kent.  Live music, good drink menu, good fries, pretty good burger & decent prices.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Grilled Cheeseburger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The truffle fries were incredible.  I didn't order an alcoholic drink, so I can't complain about it.  :)  The soda was reasonably priced and replenished often.  I strongly recommend this place if you're looking for a great burger and fries."}
{"text":"No toilet paper in the men's room.  Our server had to say \"left and right\" out loud to remember who was getting what.  Food is okay.  Service is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place is still in business, I have yet to meet someone who has had a good experience with the food service here.  They 85% of the time mess up your order, forget toppings and take forever to bring your food.  I have been here numerous times where I had to bus my own table.  Also watch your bill, sometimes they overcharged me for the duck topping even though I told the waiter  or waitress that they did it before.  

When they do really screw up like when I had a bolt in my burger I did not feel like they were going to do anything going forward that would prevent it from happening again.

Last Friday they served warm draft beer, I understand its summer, but even in Tanzania where I am from, a third world country that would never happen.

When done right the food is excellent, I just do not know what is wrong with this place, they have had many managers and different wait staff over the years but somehow things never get better.  There are not that many restaurants with nice locations like this one in kent, I hate that it is not getting better.  I bet they make enough money off the late night crowd."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and cute bartenders. Very modern look and not dingy at all like your typical bar scene. Huge selection of alcohol ranging from wine to your standard beer. I had the simpleton burger which was cottage cheese, bacon, and mushrooms. and it was great! It came with fries that were not overly salty but at the same time not stale as well as a dipping sauce that was delicious, i have no idea what it was but if i could bottle it up and take it home i would of. When ordering a burger, you have a choice of rare, med rare, well, well done, are burn the heck out of it. The prices here are reasonable and you can build your own burger for only 11 bucks. The receipt even tells you want the tip will be."}
{"text":"Had a few meal there that weren't bad.  Nice place for drinks with some friends as well."}
{"text":"Yikes.

Let me try and disassemble my visit here in a fair and rationale way. 

First off I chose this place for myself and a few friends to meet up at due to the interesting options on the Build-Your-Own-Burger. This model of building your entrees is seemingly becoming increasingly popular which I have no issues with because I'm pretty darn good at building and pairing flavors, but watch out because it is possible to create a monster. So, I show up early and instead of waiting for the group to assemble I decide to grab a drink at the bar or, so I thought. What really ended up happening is I sat there for 10 minutes with the bartenders refusing to make eye contact with me. They were busy-ish sure, but what was downright hilarious is that I wasn't asked if I wanted something until a couple sat next to me and the bartender meandered over immediately asking THEM if they wanted a drink to which my mouth dropped and my hand flew up in the air like \".....whaaa??\". His response - \"Oh would you like something to drink too?\" Uhm, yes that is why I'm sitting here, \"Kentucky Bourbon please\". I was trying to not be irritated as he literally threw my card back at me and it fell but it was increasingly difficult. Maybe he had me confused with someone he knew and hated? Nope guess not, because when my three friends showed up it was like pulling teeth to get them a drink too.

We finally get a table, happy to be away from the bar and look over the menu. The menu, I have to say it, looks good and I had plenty of time to look it over because no one came to take our order. (In fact the hostess came over after a while and asked if anyone had come up to us. When we said no she said she would find out what was going on and a few minutes later our friendly although not attentive server showed up). My medium burger was done well, I just ignored the temp mishap and dug in. The flavor was decent but for a combination of Gouda, arugula, mushrooms, bacon, and garlic aioli I wasn't able to sing praises as I had expected. For $10 I was looking for this burger to be as delicious as gourmet-burger options in neighboring cities.  It wasn't offensive but it wasn't impressive either.  With our servers friendly smile it was hard to get irritated at our empty drinks but at this point the place was only half full. I don't really understand what is going on here.

I don't believe I'll ever be back. I officially have absolutely no interest in returning - which is weird since I was pretty pumped to check it out but the experience was a total slap in the face. Perhaps I came at an off night and I guess as more reviews come trickling in time will tell but there was nothing redeeming about my visit here. Not service, not atmosphere, not food, not prices, not-- well wait a minute they were playing 80s which I was pretty down with.

Enter at your own risk.

**Edit: Okay, maybe I lied about never going back. I was contacted by a manager of Bar 145 and asked if there was anything they could do to make this right. I won't take handouts but I do believe that a place that makes an effort to contact customers deserves a second shot. Next time I'm in the area I'll try and stop by and if my experience is even an ounce better I'll update accordingly. Even though the bartender may want to ostracize me the management certainly doesn't so I'll keep an open mind!**"}
{"text":"This place can be hit or miss on service and I never know what to expect. On most visits, it has been outstanding. The following week, however, and it's average. The space, indoor and out, is fun and welcoming with a vibe that creates a good environment. It can be breezy and cold near the door so keep that in mind during the winter. The burgers are excellent as are most of the other main items. The starters are also good with no obvious let downs. I've been here over a dozen times every year since they've opened and I've never had food that I didn't like. The selection of bourbons is stellar, as are the beer choices. It's not uncommon for them to be out of certain varieties, however, which can be annoying if you don't have a second (or third, on one occasion) choice in mind. 

Other than some inconsistent service, I only have one other criticism.  However, it is significant enough that I will never recommend Bar 145 to others or return unless invited by someone else. I've been in sales for 20 plus years and have dined across the country in hundreds of establishments, from the lowest to the highest end, and I've never encountered anything like Bar 145's policy.  The first time I encountered it was a family dinner with a dozen people that had ordered appetizers and drinks in addition to our entrees.  I mention this because I believe context is important in assessing the policy.  When I received my duck confit salad, I didn't see any duck. After some digging, I found 4 or 5 small pieces; barely enough to qualify the salad as it name suggests. When I pointed this out to my server she said she would talk to the kitchen. When she returned, she informed me that the chef said I could have additional duck but at a charge of $1.00. I declined the \"offer\" to pay more to fix the problem. The salad was ok but would have been much better with the proper balance of protein to greens. In all of my years of dining out I've never encountered an establishment that wants to charge you more in response to a legitimate criticism regarding their dish. In retrospect, I should have sent the food back and declined to pay but given the nature of our visit (my birthday) it didn't seem like the thing to do, especially over a $1. But why was I, as a customer, put in that position, over a $1?  Why would a restaurant add $1 on a bill that exceeded $200 in response to a complaint? Why did the server have to \"check with the kitchen\"?  Regardless, I chalked it up to an anomaly and moved on. 

Several months later, I met a client at Bar 145 after work for drinks and food. After a round, we ordered some food, including the artichoke and spinach dip. About half way through the dip, we ran out of bread and my client asked the waitress if we could get some more. Her response? You guessed it.  When my customer asked me if he had violated some unknown, Portage County etiquette regarding bread, I assured him that he was fine but it was going to cost him a buck.  When our server returned he understood what I was talking about. Unfortunately, our dip had cooled quite a bit by the time our $1 bread arrived. His take? \"That's just silly.\"

For the owners of the Bar 145 chain - Why do you have this policy and why do you handle it so awkwardly? It's tacky and unprofessional.  For the $2, it has cost you over $1000 in sales in just the past year. If I wanted the opportunity to biggie size my meal for a buck, I'd go to Wendy's. Overall, you have a great concept and I'd like to come back but I'm afraid that I won't have the correct change to use your bathroom. If you are attempting to generate additional revenue, you are going about it the wrong way. If you are trying to keep costs down, you are going about it the wrong way. If you are trying to curtail people trying to get free food, you are going about it the wrong way."}
{"text":"one of the best restaurant/pubs I have ever been too.  Classy, hip establishment with great food and a superb selection of craft beers.  Go during happy hour and save a decent amount of money, without sacrificing the quality and uniqueness of their menu creations.  Highly recommend the sliders and BBQ bacon appetizer, but don't forget the fries with duck confit!  Can't wait to get back to Kent...."}
{"text":"Waited over thirty minutes before waitress even stopped by our table. Food can be good but they are frequently out of standard menu items and drinks."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, The first time I ordered a burger (simpleton) and some appetizers with a group of friends.  The food was all decent , the burger was tasty though not worth 11 dollars by any means.  The duck poutine was kind of lousy and bland.  Overall the food is not worth what they charge (small portions too).  But the SERVICE.   

THE SERVICE IS SOME OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  

Both times I went , both waitresses seemed like they had no idea how to serve, and were completely wrong on many things on the menu.  They straight up didn't even know half of it, and were trying to surcharge every single thing we asked for.  I don't go out to eat to get nickel and dimed to death for every little thing.  Servers seemed 'sort-of' nice, but were clueless about how to really deal with customers.  They blamed things on us, and asked who was managing last time we came because our vegetarian wanted to sub a veggie patty instead of meat on a burger, she told us \"no substitutions but we'll do it once\".

Ordered mid-rare burgers, they come out well done or raw.  Loud annoying music, awful service.  The food is OKAY.  I honestly would rather eat a five-guys burger, let alone b-spot, flipside, or any number of other true good burgers that are priced this high.  

AVOID."}
{"text":"Great Bourbon selection!  Burgers are delicious. Busy on Friday night. Not great for groups bigger than 6. One of my favorite places. This is a fun, loud bar."}
{"text":"A gastropub that tries to be upscale.  OK, I gave it a go and I'm not sure if I would go back.  First and foremost, parking sucks.  By the time you find a spot, you're already in a bad mood.  When hubby and I first walked in, we were pleased.  A sign up front tells you to wait to be seated, and we were seated promptly.  Our waitress came quickly and took our drink orders and returned just as fast.  So far everything has been great.  Fast, friendly service is always a plus, and it has lightened my mood significantly.  I ordered the Pork & Cheese.  It is supposed to be an open faced sandwich.  A ciabatta bun that has been garlic toasted with a burger on one side and pulled pork on the other, all topped with some cheese fondue sauce with a side of truffle fries.  Well, this is what caused them to get 3 stars.  When the waitress brought it out, my jaw dropped.  I just about had a heart attack.  I swear it looked like someone just vomited on my plate.  I had a mound of chunky grey food set in front of me.  I closed my eyes and took a bite, my husband laughing a me the whole time, and it tasted good, but GOOD GRACIOUS it looked disgusting.

I don't know if I'll ever go back because of the parking situation, but I am definitely NOT getting that dish again!"}
{"text":"Usually when you go to a BURGER bar that specializes in BURGERS, they do not bring you what was clearly a frozen store bought burger. When half your name is 145, my medium rare burger should not be well done. When the other half of your name is Bar, I should not give up and order water after 3 of the beers I tried to order were out, which doesn't even include the 5 you already told me you were out of. Also, you only have 1 of the 5 breads on your menu?? This place used to be my favorite, but after my last few visits, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We went here on a warm night in April. We tried it only bc the restaurant we had originally planned to eat at was crowded. 
We were seated on the patio and waited at least 10min before our server appeared. They were out of two kinds of beer we requested:  
For dinner we ordered the salmon tacos and an Americana burger with side salads.
The salads we bigger than we expected at pretty good, until I found part of a plastic bag in mine! 
The server apologized as well as the manager who said a round of drinks were on him.  It was at least 20 min from the time she took our salad plates until the food came. 
My husband said his burger was ok-nothing remarkable. He'd asked for no mayonnaise but the burger was drenched in it. The truffle fries were good but cold.
My salmon tacos were very bland - the flour tortilla was cold - the salmon itself had a nice flavor.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We were really unimpressed with how limited the menu was. We ordered a disappointing dinner, only to find out AFTER we paid the check that you could customize the burgers with anything you wanted. Our server neglected to tell us this."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!  After we were seated and the waitress finally took our order the food came out all wrong.  Our appetizers showed up at the same time as the food, the burgers were closer to beef jerky than the medium we ordered.  We had one kids meal and it was the last thing to come out...  We had to ask for forks, ask for our complete orders and hunt someone down to bring our checks because our waitress was hanging out by the kitchen."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm
Best burger in northeast ohio. Sorry Michael Symon....this beats B-Spot for me :(
Great apps. Great sides. Great beers. Live music. And I can bring my 3 year old if necessary. 
I still have some other \"famous\" Cleveland/Akron burgers to try so we'll see how they stack up....stay tuned....."}
{"text":"I loved the large bar and atmosphere. Too bad their drinks are way overpriced. 9 bucks for a blood orange Margarita that tasted like kool-aid. No wonder they don't advertise the drink prices on their menu. We didn't stay to eat so I can't comment on the food. Meh............... Headed elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be \"THE place\" to get burgers and bourbon, two staples of my weekly diet. Yes, I live a healthy lifestyle. Anyways, my friend and I stopped by here on a Friday during dinnertime and I was shocked by how busy the place was! Based on that alone I thought that this was going to be an amazing experience. When the server brought us the dinner menu we were both surprisingly disappointed at the burger options. Normally when I peruse through a menu I can find at least two or three items that stand out to me and from there I struggle to decide. Not here. The burger menu looked average, boring. Honestly, I had a hard time choosing something that I would like, but I settled.

Overall, the food was just okay, nothing special. However, their bourbon menu was impressive. If you decide to give this place a try I recommend coming when it's not super busy, it can get pretty noisy. 

Our bill was a little pricy (2 entrees, beers, and tip) came to about $60. I considered that pricy because the food just okay. 

Since coming here for dinner I've been back several times over the summer and in the fall just to socialize and drink. They do have a nice patio where you can chill by a gas fireplace and on certain nights you can enjoy live entertainment. Would I recommend coming here specifically for the burgers? Probably not, but it's a good place to grab some drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service and tasty food! Loved the battered pickle chips and have been back twice since!"}
{"text":"Bar 145 and I have a mixed relationship. I have made 4 trips to bar 145 since it has started and out of those 4 trips I was able to eat there 2 of them.

The first time i tried to visit Bar 145 was after they posted on their facebook a delicious picture of a spinach flatbread, Having wanted to go there for awhile this seemed very opportunistic. I later came to learn I had missed a post immediately after that saying they were going to be closed for a private party that night. Although let down by the experience I refused to let it stop me from trying to eat their.

My second attempt must have been completely my fault for trying to take my friends to Bar 145 on St. Patties day. We got there around 7 and sat there for over 30 minutes without nay staff talking to us. Since it was St. Patties day I assumed something was off and asked a door man how you got food. He then let me know I had to order at bar. We promptly left.

Let down by previous 2 events I finally found my way to Bar 145 one night and not only got seated but was given the most spectacular service I could ever imagine. Not only was my service fast, accurate and the server knowledgeable but the food was amazing!!! After this event I got back on my horse talking to everyone about how they needed to go here for the best food in Kent.

A month or so later I was able to talk a friend into having dinner with me at the Bar 145. I was excited for the experience of sharing what I had found. Sadly after being sat we waited... and waited... 10 minutes or more later a server finally came by. Confused I put on my happy face and was hopeful the rest of service would be better. It was not. Not only did we wait very long time for our drinks it was like pulling teeth for the waitress to explain the menu items or even any specials which i knew they had from their facebook. Additionally, just getting her to come back to take the order took the length of both mine and my friends drinks.... Un happy i assured my friend it was all worth it for the food. This is where my heart sank. My food came to the table 5 - 10 minutes before my friends.... I consider this unacceptable as we order at the same time I sat with my food getting cold waiting for my friends to be delivered. The food was amazing.

Bar 145 I cannot give you more then 3 stars. You have serious service issues. Your food i 5 stars in my book but being unable to enjoy consistently my hands are tied."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. Burgers are delish. And don't leave without trying the  truffle fries dipped in red pepper aoli sauce. The dill ranch is also fantastic. The testy decor is warm, modern rustic. I'm already looking forward to coming again."}
