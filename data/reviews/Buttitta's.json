{"text":"We went to Buttitta's last night. We had made reservations and were sat quickly. The dining room was really beautiful; big chandeliers, candles on the tables, cloth napkins, big picture windows. It was a large dining room, but didn't feel large. It still felt intimate. It quickly got pretty full in the dining room. I was pretty surprised since we were there early. Still though, I never had a problem with noise and could hear my husband quite easily (should be noted that I only have about 50% hearing in my left ear). Point being, it's a large space, but not noisy. 

We ordered the radicchio with goat cheese and pistachio filling for an appetizer. Unfortunately, they said that it was no longer being served since it hadn't been too popular. Not a problem! We got the calamari. I'm not so much of a seafood fan, but my husband is. He loved it! It wasn't overly breaded. Wasn't over cooked. Very nicely done. Thumbs up!

We had two house salads. I loved the house Italian. Seemed that it was a raspberry vinaigrette. LOVED it! The dressing was light, the greens were fresh and crisp. It came with some kind of Parmesan crisp. Yummy.

We used to be huge Dom's fans, so of course we had to go for the Galena and Chicken a la' Dom, and split each. It was very reminiscent of what we got at Dom's, but dressed up a bit. It was a nice, generous portion. Each plate had a scoop of spaghetti with marinara and sauteed onions and peppers in addition to the entree. The Chicken a la Dom was so delicious. The sauce was creamy and cheesy. The Galena was equally as delicious. 

For dessert we had the creme brulee. It's not your typical creme brulee, but l was pleasantly surprised. It's hard to explain, but it was layered and has kiwi and strawberries sliced in it. It was delicious.  

As for the service...A+! Our waiter was Jesse, a nice young man. As soon as we sat down and got situated he was right there. Very quick! 
Did a nice job suggesting wine for me. Our service was prompt, our waiter was polite. There was a kid coming around who never let my water glass get less than half full. 

Our appetizers, salads and entrees were perfectly timed, never felt rushed. Our appetizer was yummy and crisp, the house dressing was delicious, our entrees came out hot and wonderful. 

I've read previous reviews and I think that maybe it can be attributed to a new restaurant working the kinks out.  My husband and I had a nice evening and great dinner. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I would give them zero star for the service. The food is not bad. I had fish fillet with penne pesto. I didn't notice anything wrong with the service at first. But it soon became clear that the waitress had no interest in serving us food. It took them a whole hour to get our dessert. At first I thought because they were busy. I looked around the restaurant while waiting for my dessert. We were the only table there!! It was pretty ridiculous. We ended up getting the dessert boxed to go. Not going back to that place."}
{"text":"We tried Buttitta's for the first time last night. And when I say last night, I mean that we were there for a good chunk of the night. We were not in a hurry, but things were not moving too quickly. Overall, though, the service was good. Before I say anything more, I should point out that we were BIG fans of Dom's and miss that place somethin' awful. Although there are some menu items from Dom's, you should check your expectations at the door. This is definitely not Dom's. For one, the environment is completely different. Dom's was an old place with a unique, dare I say gaudy, ambiance. And I loved this because I always felt like I was eating in the basement at my Italian grandparents' house. Buttitta's is VERY nice, big, and generally classy. Now for the food. We had the pan fried calamari. It's very good, but is different from Dom's, which I consider the best I ever had. No signature garlic bread or salad from Dom's. We learned after ordering those items were a la cart. For our entrees, my wife had the cheese ravioli with meat sauce and I had spaghetti a la Dom. Both were good, but again, different. For desert, the Tiramasu was light, creamy, and good. We'll be back to Buttita's after they work out some kinks (saw a server yell at a cook, slow service, and an issue with my entree that was quickly repaired), but will have tempered our expectations regarding our old faves. Oh, one more note--for a higher end place, Buttitta's is reasonably priced. $55 for two glasses of wine, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and desert to share."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was exceedingly terrible. Spend the night in the ER terrible.

To make up for it, the owner gave me and a friend the opportunity to come back for a meal on the house. While other people told me not to go, I figured as long as I went armed with an epi-pen when the restaurant wasn't too busy, I had a shot at survival.

Tonight, the restaurant was operating at a much more comfortable pace. I talked to the chef. I had a delicious dinner - maybe not $14 worth of delicious, but still, a pretty solid dish. The staff was friendly and attentive. I am not sure if it is because they almost killed me, or if it is because that is how they normally operate.

I will go back one more time when I am not getting complimentary service to see just how the kitchen operates. But, this place is a pretty solid choice for a night out for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I loved Buttita's!  I had an excellent time there for dinner with my family with service that was second to none.  They have a great wine list, beautifully decorated interior, and the prices are affordable (by Chicago standards anyway).  So I have to echo Lisa B: why the three stars?  The food. :(

I ordered a house salad with Italian dressing to start.  The dressing was outstanding - really good and garlicky - but the salad was lacking.  I loved that it had spinach in it, but that was literally all it had... spinach and lettuce, no carrots or cucumber or anything of the sort.  It left me feeling sort of disappointed, especially because my dad ordered the antipasto salad which looked EXCELLENT.

For my entree I panic-ordered Spaghetti a la Dom... never a good situation, but all eyes were on me, and call me crazy, but when a restaurant has its name (or former name, kinda?) on a dish, I expect it to be one of the best on the menu.  I was not happy with my choice... the volume of pasta served was notable and the meatball was pretty good, but the sauce on the pasta was just kind of \"meh\".  It needed salt and garlic and more tomatoes... it was kind of watery and didn't really taste like much.  The Italian sausage that came with my dish was also just.... weird.  It was super spicy, but not pepper spicy - I think it had an overabundance of fennel stuffed into the casing, so much so that the fennel seeds overwhelmed the meat and dried it out.  

However, my dad's stuffed shells and my grandmother's pappardelle were amazing (they took pity on me and let me try theirs).  My grandfather's baked lasagna looked great too.  My mom ordered the mustard salmon with orzo and said that it wasn't nearly as good as the last time she'd gotten it, but it still looked and tasted excellent.

I will definitely give Buttita's another try and next time - no panic ordering."}
{"text":"We had a 6:15 reservation for a group of about 20 on Saturday night.  We were seated immediately.  The drinks were ordered and arrived quickly.  The interior was really nice and had a very classy feel to it. 

Why three stars?  The food.  I am not sure if it is because they are still new but my food was not even warm.  I ordered the Chicken Galena which chicken stuffed with beef and pork with a sauce over it.  It really didn't taste too bad but it would have been better had it been fresh.  I didn't want to say anything because it took a long time just to get the food in the first place.

The bathrooms are really hard to find so make sure you ask for directions.  All around it was a neat experience and I would go again if invited by someone but I would not suggest this place if I were choosing where to eat for dinner."}
{"text":"Ate at Buttitta's for lunch today.  The decor is impressive especially compared to the former tenant, Jillian's.  I had the house salad with house vinaigrette and gnocchi with roasted chicken.  It was delicious and the right amount for lunch, but I expected bread service with a pasta dish and/or the salad - it's an Italian restuarant after all.  My husband had Italian beef sandwich and fries.  He liked his choice as well.  Served a nice strong cup of coffee.  A little on the expensive side for for lunch; $13/person. Service was great.  We'll definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is better than the food.  Not remarkable Italian food, but good enough.  Our table had the chicken galena, the gnocchi, spaghetti alla dom, lasagne, and the sea bass.  No one complained and no one exclaimed.  Standard, and the atmosphere makes it good for the price. 

Out waitress, Katrina, was fantastic.  She said it was her first night serving, which usually makes me worry a touch, but she did a wonderful job.  She was careful with our orders and got everything right... made sure to check back with us on anything that was iffy. 

We got very good service at the bar (during our 1 hour + wait).  Asked for wine recs and the bartender said, \"to be honest, I'm a whiskey and bourbon guy\" - and I really appreciated the honesty.  Most bartenders would've blindly recommended something based on nothing."}
{"text":"So not impressed. I went with a group from work and we arrived around noon. We were seated quickly, but right near a speaker blaring, yes blaring, music. We could barely hear ourselves talk. 

Our waiter took our order and then informed us that a large group just placed their orders, so there would be a wait. Really? Are you that understaffed that you can't handle more than 30 people in a restaurant at once??? 

Needless to say, we waited a REALLY, REALLY long time. The waiter never offered us a discount, salad, bread, or anything else as compensation for our wait. The food came and it was far from spectacular. I ordered the Portabella Panini and it wasn't  anything I couldn't have made at home. OK, definitely not great, and not worth waiting over an hour for lunch. :("}
{"text":"We arrived at about 6:15 PM on Wednesday without reservations.  Both parking lots were pretty full, and the place was packed - good for them!  We were told it would be 20-30 minute wait for the four of us and we could wait in the bar.  Considering our lack of reservations and the crowd, the wait seemed very reasonable.  

The bar area was very comfortable.  Intimate, but not cramped.  We got a seat at a nice set of sofas and ordered a few drinks at the bar.  The wait was exactly as promised, so definitely no complaints here.  Also, they put a lot of effort into the decor, and have a semi-open kitchen, which I think is always a nice indicator of the confidence I can have in the cleanliness of a place.  

Once seated we got our bread bowl.  The rolls were quite tasty and the butter was at a temperature where it was not too cold to spread, but not warm enough to have been sitting in the \"danger zone\" for too long.  More drinks were ordered.  Apparently their ice tea is a special mix just for Buttitta's with hints of peach and \"wild berry.\"  It was delicious!  

My husband ordered a house salad with Italian dressing.  It seemed like more of a raspberry vinaigrette, but it was wonderful and had a tantalizing ciabatta-asiago crouton crisp.  And they actually use hand graters for Parmesan cheese, not the goofy hand cranks like OG.  I thought that was a nice touch. 

For our entrees, we happened to order only 2 dishes between the four of us.  Two of us ordered the Chicken a la Dom and two of us ordered the seabass, I can't remember the exact name.  Wow, what a treat!  I had a bite of my husbands chicken and it was super tasty, but admittedly, I wouldn't have traded it for my sea bass.  I wish I had paid more attention to what was supposed to be on my plate.  They were out of gnocchi and I think that my dish was supposed to have gnocchi.   Instead I got bowtie pasta with a pesto sauce under the fish.  It was the best pasta I have ever eaten outside of Italy.  

The pesto and pasta were both very light and the pesto was just fantastic!  The fish was moist and just slightly flaky (in a good way) with just a hint of nice crispness.  The tomato-y topping on the fish was the perfect accent to the dish.  I was full at the end, but not overly so, which I think speaks to the lightness of the pasta considering how much I ate.  I actually finished my dish, which is quite a feat considering I'm 9 months pregnant and don't have much room left in the stomach area.  

I wish I had had room for dessert, but once the baby is out you can bet I'll be ordering the tiramisu after dinner that I've heard just melts in your mouth.

Service was very friendly.  Wait was certainly reasonable, though with as well as I think this place will do, I would recommend reservations.  Food was awesome!  I cannot stress that enough!  Between 2 beers for the husband, the salad, my tea and the 2 full entrees we shilled out around $50 which was completely and utterly worth it.  Decor was awesome and they have obviously done an extreme makeover in the parking department offering a new lot and an update to the old parking lot so that a Prius can drive through it without being swallowed in a pothole now.  I'm smiling right now just thinking about our next trip.  I must say, usually I'm really nervous about eating at newly opened restaurants as they usually aren't up to par yet and then I get an undeserved negative opinion.  Well, Buttita's proved me wrong and just blew my socks off.  Yum and happy eating!"}
{"text":"Menu includes items from Dom's Patio Villa, such as Chicken a la Dom, a breaded chicken dish and gourmet pizzas, steaks, seafood and pastas.

They have a variety of beers.  This is in the former location of Jillian's.  The building was originally buit as a Coca Cola bottling plant."}
{"text":"I originally wrote this nearly a year ago. I've been back several times since. While I think the food is pretty good, the service leaves much to be desired. On one trip, had to ask the manager to get a coffee refill. Now, my original review.

We arrived at 6pm and were seated in the main dining room. It was quite busy for a Thursday. In remodeling the place, they did not think using any materials to absorb sound was important. Large room full of people, all trying to talk above music that was playing quite loudly -- very annoying.

Service was hard to describe; perhaps \"peculiar\"? They may be suffering from over-specialization. The person who took our order was very friendly, etc., but she was not our server, only our order-taker. Others served the food. I've seen this done better and worse, but it almost never is done well. Pet peeve: food delivery staff that does not know who gets what, and does not understand the special request communicated to the order-taker. When we were done with a course, the order-taker (not being the plate-clearer) left our dirty plates until the plate-clearer eventually arrived to remove most (but not all) of the dirty plates. Twice with coffee and at least twice with water, we had to point out the need for refills. Our order-taker, not being the one responsible for refills, assured us that someone would be right over to take care of it. Several minutes later (on each occasion), a refill-person arrived and needed prompting to fill more than one type of vessel. Seems to me that there should be someone assigned to be in charge of service for a table, and that should include being aware of the need for more water, coffee, rolls, whatever, before the diners are. And that person, if the designated refill delivery person is slow, busy, or MIA, should take it upon him/her-self to grab a pitcher and refill glasses, all while continuing to be friendly and helpful.

We had a pair of appetizers shared among the four of us, bruschetta and calamari. Here, I should point out that we had the pan-fried calamari, having been informed that they were out of the grilled calamari. The order-taker did not know how they could be out of just one kind of calamari. My wife says they were cooked perfectly. The marinara sauce was very nice, but the aioli was even better and (unfortunately) in shorter supply. We all thought the bruschetta was nice, but I prefer the bread for my bruschetta to be toasted and to have a bit of extra virgin olive oil and garlic before we even think about the tomato mixture. Here, the tomato mixture also included marble sized pieces of mozzarella, which was a nice addition.

The \"house\" salad was nice, though not extraordinary, coming with a nice (small) cheesy crackery thing. After confirming that the house dressing was oil and vinegar, we were surprised to find that it had a fair amount of (unwanted) sugar. It tasted quite nice, but one of us really did not want the sugar surprise. I had the very nice endive salad, which also included a mixed green portion, which is where the blue cheese and caramelized nuts were.

For a main course, my wife decided on the tomato soup and the appetizer mussels. She absolutely loved the mussels, but mentioned that they were a bit sandy. (I thought there was a technique for this, involving milk or corn starch, which they really should try to employ.) The soup had a good flavor, but was really thick. It would have been better as a spread for bread.

My main course was the Grilled Barramundi (Sea Bass). The type was not specified, so I do not know whether it was a good sustainable choice. I should have asked, but didn't think to until later. On the whole, I really liked the flavors in this dish. There were a couple of issues, though. First, the fish was perfectly cooked and had great texture, but it was coated with a thick layer of extremely thick (tasty) spicy tomato sauce. I'm talking thicker even than the soup. As I said, it is really tasty, but its flavor completely overwhelmed the flavor of the fish, to the point that they could have used pretty much any fish. Second, the pesto broke, leaving the gnocchi swimming in green oil.

Strip steak received rave reviews from one of our companions.

Desert \"Creme Brulee Napoleon\" was very tasty but nothing like any creme brulee you've ever seen. Combining crisp, caramel, fruit, yum!

Got our checks at about 8:30. Nice we weren't rushed. Remains to be seen whether they can handle diners in a hurry to get to a show.

(I had to edit this review for length, to fit Yelp maximum.)"}
{"text":"I miss Gillian's too!!  Anyway, was here in December, so things may be different/have improved.  

I had somewhat high expectations as my mom's friend had recommended eating here and it is considered one of the more 'upscale' restaurants in CU...plus it has the Dom's team behind it.  But I was disappointed!  My dad and I ordered the baked lasagna and while it was unique, it was SWIMMING in grease from the sausage - needless to say leading to a tummy ache.  Good-sized portion thought.  My mom ordered the Chicken a la Dom - and while it's a huge portion (although she didn't fancy this...it's what is causing America's obesity problem!) and an overall good cream sauce, it too was very greasy....well, oily sauce.

Oh and one thing that always bugs me is when you get the exact number of pieces of bread in the table basket as the people sitting at the table - which for us was 3 - just too obvious on being skimpy.

House salad that came with the meal was good - definitely helped out by the large homemade crouton on top.

As for the space - for one, do not sit by the windows in cold weather....we got seated there and actually had to move.  But then our new table was right across from an iridescently lit kitchen with 'saloon-style' doors so it was loud, busy and bright.  By that point we didn't want to be moved again so lived with it.  Basically, avoid these two seating areas.  My final remark are the bathrooms - the entire restaurant has been beautifully transformed from it's former upscale poolhall space - but the bathrooms were left untouched...toilet seats showed 'this was a bar' wear and tear.

If you're looking for a new upscale, unique Italian joint in the C-U it's worth checking it out at least once, again, my visit was 4 months ago.  I will probably choose another place on my next visit when craving Italian."}
{"text":"First of all, I really miss Gillian's. That place was awesome.

Aside from that, I ate here once with my boyfriend. Initially, I really liked the interior and we were greeted immediately. However, we did make the mistake of coming here during Graduation weekend, so it was packed and the menu was limited. We didn't wait that long, surprisingly, and the food was pretty good, but I really want to come back when it's not packed full of students and their families so I can try the rest of the menu and hopefully give this place another star... or two!"}
