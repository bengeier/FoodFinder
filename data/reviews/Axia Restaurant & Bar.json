{"text":"LOVEEE their sushi, especially the spicy california roll, spicy salmon roll, avocado & cucumber roll. Didn't think id find a good sushi place in Mississauga, but im glad I did."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday last night. Haven't been here in a while, but have been here many times before; and it was always a decent experience. Being a Sunday night, and given the snowy weather, the place wasn't busy at all; maybe three other tables. We were a party of 4, but 3 places were set, and the waiter (I believe his name was Steven) left. We waited for a bit, the had to call him back to set the 4th place. They had couple of prix fixe menus, which we all decided to try. Two of us got the Chinese style tenderloin sizzling plate and one got the Ginger beef on a sizzling plate (I think that's what it was called). The waiter brought one plate out first and placed it in front of my dad. There was a very long lag between the meals being brought out, so my dad started on his meal. He next brought my plate out, and spilled some of the sticky sauce on me (ok fine, mistakes happen...no real concern for it though). My meal was completely different from my dad's though we had ordered the same thing. On being asked he said that the meal that my dad was ALREADY consuming was actually my uncle's. He then proceeded to slide the plate over to my uncle!! We were dumfounded! We said my uncle would like a new prepared meal, not my dad's half consumed one. He took it back to the kitchen, and brought it out on a new plate that was not hot and with no sauce. It was VERY obvious that they had taken the SAME meal and put it on a different plate. Umm hygiene??! Since it was another family member,  my uncle wasn't too concerned about my dad's 'cooties'; and since he was hella hungry (and we had already been waiting a while) my uncle proceeded to eat. He then brought out the right meal for my dad and then said he would give us a dessert on the house. All the prixe fixe meals came with dessert, so not sure what his reasoning for that was. My mom and uncle said their meal was ok, the meal my dad and I got were terrible. Sub-par beef in a sticky sweet sauce. I barely got through half. Ahh then came the wait for the bill. All  in all a terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Sashimi was fresh. Gyoza was dry. Beef and broccoli was alright. The interior is a little tacky. The female bathroom had a strong sewage odour that made me gag. My fianc√© and I decided to try this restaurant again after 5 years from the first time we went and it was still below our expectations. I do not foresee another visit in the near future."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. There's a lot of variety in asian food and there are some good vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group over the long weekend.  The restaurant was busy but were able to accommodate our big party of 8.  Our group ordered several dishes to share including sushi, hot and sour soup, deep fried soft shell crab, crispy chow mein, sizzling beef and shrimp.  The service was outstanding considering how busy it was (Valentine's Day) and the food was delicious. We love coming here not only for the great food and ambience but for the wide range of asian cuisine they offer.  Also, their wine selection is fantastic at a good price point with several options by the glass, not your typical asian restaurant selection :)"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try out this place for a long time and finally did this past weekend. The space inside belies it's quiet exterior and the restaurant was packed. Thankfully we had reserved our table in advance. It had a good staff to customer ratio and so service was good. The variety on the menu makes it difficult to choose. Food portions enormous. So, unless you have an elephantine appetite, think twice before ordering appetizers before the entrees. But they let you take a doggie bag home so nothing is lost. Our server was attentive and pleasing in her demeanour. Overall experience was very good making a return visit to this place a worthwhile one."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch! The service is amazing and we have our staff party here every year. We always make sure to request Ricky as our server, he goes above and beyond in ensuring that his customers are happy and well served! The sushi is high quality and the ambiance is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Came here because the temple was down for renovation, so I thought why not give this place a try  I liked the decor, it was cute and quite a lot to look at but nice. The service was decent, nice and quick and not too pestering but still mediocre.  And the food wasn't much better.  I got the green curry vegetable; it was wayyyy too sweet and thick and looked like gooop. And the green colour was so extremely artificial looking I wondered if they just dumped a box of food colouring in there. The corn and mushroom had a very weird taste, kind of like cardboard - so they must've been frozen. The only good vegetable was the broccoli, but the pieces were so big that it was hard to bite.  My friend had the sake bento box. The rice was too warm and kept falling apart, and there was way too much of it. I would say there was 3x as much rice as fish. The sashimi was also warm and looked very butchered. I would say her California roll though was be best part of the experience, however none of it was worth the money.  The bento box was 15 and so was the curry which was extremely overpriced considering you could go to a lunch buffet and get the same quality food. As for the curry, you could find a very authentic one for $10, especially for a vegetarian one.  Even for a non picky eater, this place was way below par"}
{"text":"I like Axia because of the diverse menu. All the dishes I've tried are delicious. The one complaint I have is that depending on who is working, service can be poor. On more than one occasion I've had to solicit a random server to attend to me at my table, where my server neglected to check on us (as they should)."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from Axia last night. I had Tom Yum soup, tempura shrimp Bento box and a side of edamame. The food was okay. The gyoza in the Bento box were probably the best part. I ordered the soup extra spicy and it was not spicy at all. I probably wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and i ordered a chirashi lunch. Not impressed with the price and portion size. $20 gets me only a 9 piece sashimi. The pieces were also cut unevenly. I would get a tiny piece here and there mixed with normal size pieces. Not worth it. Our waitress was also slow and didn't fill our water unless we asked. We always had to track her down. I also got mango bubble tea and it tasted like watered down sugar milk."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Sunday evening. We arrived one hour before closing. We weren't greeted. A person behind the counter just told us to sit at an empty table by the door. A table which wasn't even cleaned from the precious guests. We waited 5 minutes for a waiter to come. Nobody showed up. We decided it wasn't worth our time and money to eat here. So we just left. Hope they learn how to treat their guests right."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, the food is always good and service by Linda is outstanding. I recommend the Chow Mein and the sushi, but all the food is really good."}
{"text":"Axia used to be one of my family & I's favourite places to go for dinner. The food was flavourful, cheap, filling and just overall delicious. However, they've recently changed their recipes and our family was very disappointed with the results. The food is now very bland, and none of the dishes we ordered were any good at all. We are all very sad as we will not be returning until the recipes are changed once again, hopefully to what they originally were."}
{"text":"First observation: the exterior did not match with the interior. I thought I would be walking in to a contemporary, sleek interior but instead I got a dining area that reminded me of a mall food court.  My group were seated in a narrow private room. It was stuffy even with the electric fan on. Our waitress was clumsy and looked overwhelmed - at one point she walked away from our table in mid-sentence.   I'm not sure if I would eat sushi here again but their Chinese food was quite delicious. Axia restaurant made me realize that I'm not really into Asian fusion."}
{"text":"The sushi combination offers quite a large portion, nice environment, and excellent service from staff!"}
{"text":"We book a table for 8. Nicely we have a VIP room but thanks the room is so small that our chairs are back to all sides of the walls surrounding us.  Every time when the waiter serves us, we have to split aside for him to reach the table.  My sister-in-law is so hot, probably due to the poor ventilation, which she wants to leave right after the dinner.  It's her birthday!  We order 6 green teas that come in 3 pots.  Whenever we pour about 2.5 cups, the pot runs out and we have to ask for water refill.  Why the restaurant doesn't have a larger pot for 2 people?  The bento box, sushi, sashimi and the rolls all are good.  They are not fascinating but are good.  With the restaurant not specialize but more general in Asian food serving Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai, it is better than we expect.   The waiter is sometime hard to call him, maybe we are in a small corner room.  Last time when we sit outside the room, the service is a bit better."}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant. So many options, and you can't go wrong with whatever you choose! Our must-haves are Black Dragon rolls & Thai green shrimp curry"}
{"text":"Went here after reading a few reviews to go for tempura in Mississauga and I was definitely satisfied with the outcome. Service was OK but food made up for the hectic surroundings. Seating was second rate, casual and good for kids. All in all I would go back we both enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Ordered tom yum soup, not yum. Chilli chicken quality not good and way too spicy. Veg noodles, forget it. The veggies were super soggy. Not too impressed overall."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Lunch. You can have your lunch for around $10 bit pricier than other Asian lunch places but they serve Thai Chinese and Japanese food and they also serve halal combos in lunch as well. Portion are relatively large than regular lunch store you for lunch 2 people eat easily."}
{"text":"I am kind of confused at the low score this establishment has. When it comes to sushis, low main, pad thai, and asian apps, Axia has it made. Affordable prices with great big portions. Their noodle and meat dishes are very tasty and their sushis are fresh and top notch.   Great ambience and lovely service. I've been here numerous times and have never had a bad time, I always left satisfied. Try this place out."}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for this pan-Asian resto. Despite the slow service, they let a group of 4 of us hang out for hours and slowly order our meals dish by dish. The food tasted better than I thought for something that really is fasian (my term for fake Asian) food but the prices aren't horrible given how new the decor is and there's plenty of space. it depends on the dish because I thought the mango salad was a sad array fruit with of lots of salt (yes salt!) in it! The best part was the free bubble tea when you check in on the Yelp mobile app."}
{"text":"This location has been a bit of a buzz around Sauga and I hadn't had a chance to check it out. Surprisingly, a gentleman heard of my love for sushi and yours truly was brought here for a date.  It's an interestingly large restaurant ,serving a wide scale of Asian cuisines.  There was too many choices and sometimes that is not a good thing. Luckily I usually know my way around an Asian menu, especially sushi. Some call be Bond. Others know me as  fake-sushi-lover. Whatever. Same diff.   The waiter was extremely polite and sat us down to a smaller table for 2 by the window. Water was served right away. I noticed the crowd was a bit upscale. It's not your local sushi joint around the corner.  Note: business casual would be appropriate here.   order: Black bean beef with chkn fried rice - Not bad. The rice was delicious. The portion was decent.  spicy crab roll - myeh. Oddly , this took the longest to come out  edemame - awesome, not too much salt either. woot woot! szechuan chicken with steamed rice -  was way too spicy  The ambiance is a bit too cold for me, perhaps for a family dinner would be much more suited for this place. Over all, the food is good but it wouldn't be my first choice for sushi.   still gots love for you sauga.  xoxo M."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, one server working with six tables full. A whole 10 minutes passed and we were not even offered water. Cannot comment on food because we walked out without being served. Not happy with service. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here with a date and was very dissatisfied with the food. Ambiance is nice.   We were seated in a corner and weren't catered to. I think I'll check another place for sushi instead."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable. My family and I come here almost every month. We have done so for the past 2-3 years.  There is so much variety that you can always surprise yourself with a new dish.  Today, we tried the tempura cheesecake. It is wonderful. Please try it with a little ice cream and whipped cream on top and when you lick your lips, here's a toast from me."}
{"text":"Agree with most reviews on this place.  Food is good. Atmosphere is great. Service needs work.   Will visit again."}
{"text":"If you've got a sushi craving but not hungry enough for a buffet or don't wanna spend too much, this is a great place to go to! Bento boxes are great for this! Or if you're with a small group, it's nice to get a few items to share. They've got a nice variety of food to satisfy whatever you're craving!   Bento boxes are the best cuz you get a bit of each depending on what you want. Sushi rolls, sashimi, tempura (shrimp or veg), chicken (fried or grilled), gyoza, fish...you name it!   One of my fave (and family fave) to get is the Singapore noodles! A little on the oily side but soooo good! Perfect amount of spice and flavours in it."}
{"text":"I liked the variety on the menu. The portions were generous; we had plenty left over to take home. I saw almost every table had a take out bag when they were done. The meal option 'for one' offered a lot of food for a good value versus even ordering just 2 items on their own from the menu. Atmosphere is nice, though there are many light bulbs burned out that need replacing in the dining area, decor area and the bathroom. I found it a bit too dark in the evening. Food did not come out together and some if us waited a long time, food was otherwise hot and tasty.  I would come again."}
{"text":"A Mecca of all asian cuisine- has Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, you name it.   Service was great. Our waiter warned us the dumplings would take a while and that our actual mains might come out first. But our dumplings ended up coming out first anyways. We had the beef dumplings and the shrimp/beef dumplings. Both were excellent! Got a little head of myself and tried to eat it all in one mouthful- rookie dumpling mistake! Basically torched my mouth with all that heat.   We also ordered the hot and sour soup, which was more on the sour side. Wouldn't recommend it! The highlight was definitely the crispy chow mein. We ordered the one that had the beef, shrimp, and chicken- smartest choice of the night! The Thai red curry on the other hand was pretty standard.   Overall would come back. Gave it a 3 stars because we feel that we've had way better Asian food before."}
{"text":"We wanted to give Axia another chance so we decided to go back.  What a disappointment! Last time we ordered sushi and it was meh... so we decided to try a bento  box and chicken curry.  The bento box was ok nothing crazy good and was not worth the 16$.  For 8$ more I HIGHLY recommend MIGA, probably the best bento box I ever had! The chicken curry was average, nothing extraordinary... anyways its probably the last time we will go..."}
{"text":"An alright family restaurant with lots of varieties of westernized asian food. I had a few problems with some of the dishes. For instance the tomyum soup was really gross and the tomatoes in it tasted like they had gone bad."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking, a SECOND updated review for this place?  Yes, well, how often do you have a really awful experience at a restaurant? Probably at least a handful. And how often after that experience did you write a review about it?  Again, probably a few handfuls.  Well, how often have you written a review and then management contacted you and apologized about it?    I've had owners or management contact me about good reviews I've written, and had heartfelt \"Thank you\"s and the like, but never has anyone contacted me when I had a bad experience.  That has only ever happened to me once, and it happened to me with Axia.  Not only did I get a sincere apology about something he didn't really have control over (people will be people sometimes and waiters are just that), but he offered me a meal on the house to make up for the experience.    Now, before you go thinking I'm changing this review just because I got a free meal, I'm not.  I'd already been to Axia four more times with the intent of writing an update before I was even contacted, and then I went a few more times before even telling the staff about the offer.  It wasn't until after I had already decided to write an update that we then went in and had the meal on the house.   And boy was it delicious.  I'm never disappointed with the food at Axia, and a few reviewers knocked down stars for \"too much selection\"- but that is never, ever a bad thing.  I love that they include Japanese food and I love even more that their wide selection allows my husband and I to eat there with new choices every time, while bringing along friends and family who prefer to eat other things.  Everyone is happy with their food every time we come.  The selection is one of the strong points.  And everything tastes so good that you pretty much know you can't go wrong.  And I have to say, even though I was terrified of having a bad experience again, we never did.  (We also haven't seen our server since, hmm.)     The reason why I'm writing this update boils down to this, aside from the good food, and good experiences I had after the one bad, management contacted me and stayed in contact.  We conversed.  I apologized for writing a review but not writing a letter, because let's be honest, if I just write a review and don't write them a letter- how can they fix the problem?  Last time I wrote that mistakes happen, it's how you deal with the mistake that counts- and Axia blew me away with how they handled one mistake.   I'll happily be, and am, a frequent visitor to Axia.    Special notes: The vegetarian Korean dumplings are to die for.   The vegetable tempura (dinner or appetizer) is one of my favorites!   My husband gets the vegetable chow mien every single time and never tires of it.      They have a great selection of vegan sushi.  If you are served by Josh (gosh I hope that's right), you're in for a wonderful experience.  He's delightful & attentive.  Oh, and in this hot weather, try the strawberry kiwi bubble tea (with tapioca)- it's delicious."}
{"text":"Came in an ordered 3 different types of sushi 6pc, while we decided on our main course. We ordered a Malaysian Thai curry with a couple of bowls of rice.  The sushi came out within 1 minute... Odd... Some pieces were stuck together. Whatever we move on. **Edited: I believe the sushi is freshly made to order.**  The Malaysian Thai curry comes it within 3 minutes! Wth at least pretend to cook it... **Edited: as per the response below, the chicken is fried and added to a pre made sauce. I'm not a fan of this practice and a good curry would be made to order.**  Threw it on our small table for 2 while we were just starting to eat the sushi. Very annoyed.  I never expect good service from Chinese restaurants, and this was on the same page.  Food was ok - the Malaysian curry is supposed to be spicy but wasn't at all, more sweet than anything.  Large menu, lot of choices between Chinese and Thai. But I guess everything is premade to accommodate such a large menu."}
{"text":"I always think that great company calls for great food. Ordered the cold crab salad sushi today for my six year old and was thoroughly impressed with it. Chicken Pad Thai was also nice, lt was loaded with veggies though if that's your thing. half price apps on Mon-Thurs until 6pm. Rice was dry, and bbt was made with powder and tough tapioca's. Overall another decent experience."}
{"text":"Its more of a 3.5 to be honest. The sushi was pretty good but I wasnt the biggest fan of their service. Only had the sushi cant comment on the rest of the menu. Will most likely return."}
{"text":"I went here for my mom's birthday party.  The place was very clean (bathrooms included) and the service was exceptional.  The food here was really good, we shared 4 dishes - Red Dragon Roll (Yum!), House Fried Rice (Yum!), Sizzling Meat tray (OMG - THIS WAS SO GOOD! The meat was well marinated and tender - just watch out - it's called \"sizzling\" for a reason *hot!*) and the Chow Mein.  The restaurant has a \"high -end\" feel, but it's inexpensive (yah!).  It's a nice place for a dinner out in the 'sauga."}
{"text":"Where else can I indulge my sushi and Chinese craving simultaneously?  Absolutely huge menu with quite the variety to satisfy the typical Asian cravings.  We ordered the Makimono bento and salmon sashimi and chicken ho fun noodles.    It was all ok and service was also friendly.  No slamming of dishes or cutlery on the table here . Be warned that the ho fun is not made from fresh rice noodles as is the case in real Chinese restos.  Sushi rice was also way overcooked to point of mushiness."}
{"text":"Service great, staff v. Accommodating. Nice place for an unplanned meal. Food excellent."}
{"text":"The food can be very good but I have had to send some dishes back, however I really enjoy the tempura and Singapore noodles. Plenty to choose from. Service can be hit and miss as I have had a few bad experiences (almost walked out once). They are getting pricey, I think to the point of starting to lose business.  I did not enjoy the bubble tea."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was like a outdoors Japanese like garden it was very pleasant.   The food was delicious and big in size.  My chicken bento box was too much for 1 meal.  Pad Thai was also delicious and huge again.   My friends self picked bento box ($19) had 5 roll pieces stacked.  I've been to many Japanese restaurants all over Toronto and they all give like 3 tiny pieces.   Also got a free Taro bubble tea with bubbles after checking in with Yelp. Tasted great as well  The only negative was a little bit of a wait for our food but really wasn't too unbearable.    I'd give it 4.5 stars will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"My second visit here in as many weeks.   First visit I thought I found my new goto asian place in Mississauga so had to try again with the kids as they are the real picky ones.      I am still impressed with this place and wish they has a location in Markham.    Reasonable prices and great selection and flavour.  Both times the wait staff were efficient and attentive.  Food was hot and tasted great.    My new goto spot for now when I am in the west and want Asian food."}
{"text":"Overall the service was friendly and fast,  and the atmosphere was good, the chicken specifically was just weird. I don't know if it was the halal chicken in particular but I don't recommend it! Other than the chicken the rest of the food and the dishes were great!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to this restaurant a couple weeks ago. The place is quite big with ample seating so we were seated almost immediately.   My rating is based exclusively on the food served at this place. My sister got a bento box and I ordered a golden curry. The bento box was quite typical in its contents-sushi, chicken cutlet, tempura, etc. which all tasted good. However, my golden curry was mediocre. The sauce was quite tasty, but it was nowhere near fresh. It tasted old (like it was made many hours prior) and the chicken was just added to the sauce and heated at the time of the order. Also, it contained zero vegetables-only chicken. I have ate at many thai restaurants before and never came across a thai curry that didn't contain any vegetables!! I told the waitress that I found it odd that there were no vegetables in my curry but she just shrugged it off and said it is what it is. I didn't feel like pushing so I left it and continued eating.   If you are considering this place, I would highly suggest staying away from the curries-they are not fresh and do not have vegetables. Other items like sushi rolls and bento boxes can be tolerated."}
{"text":"I ordered off UberEATS and I was sooo excited to finally try this place out but it was such a disappointment. The chow mien was so dry and the general tao chicken had too much artificial sauce on it. But oh man, the bubble tea! How can bubble tea taste so bad!? I was extremely disappointed. Never again"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with 12 co-workers and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, and a menu that had a huge (overwhelming?!) choice of Asian cusines (thai, japanese, chinese, malaysian).    They handled our large group well and the food came out piping hot (and spicy!)...just how it should be.  I'd recommend the tom yum soup and green curry.    The bento box that someone else ordered looked good too (miso soup, salad, tempura, sashimi, sushi).  I'll try that the next time I'm here :)"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi there, a delivery. When I got em they were old, tasted terrible and not fresh. Fish was even dried a little bit on corners. Don't buy there anything, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying the food here for a couple of years. I have recently noticed they are using a great deal of sugar in all of their dishes. Just a warning if you are diabetic."}
{"text":"I've been to alot of asian restaurants and this one of those places where you can go to where you can have a quiet eating experience... I don't know about you, but for some reason, it's never loud whenever I go there. Day or Night. And I immensely appreciate that about Axia. I can eat my grub in peace after a long day.   The exterior is very modern looking when you get there but the inside kind of throws you off.. giving you a forest like theme if you ask me. But if your the type that doesn't care about architectures and bad interior decorating... then you should be fine to go in here.  The staff is always friendly so rest assure that you wouldn't have some rude server waiting on you. I love how their not the type to always bug you with \"How's the food?\"..then 20secs later \"Would you like anything else?\"...etc etc etc about your whole dining experience because that just ruins my appetite. ONE QUESTION IS ENOUGH thankyouverymuch.  About the food, they have a ton of variety of asian cuisines on the menu (Cantonese, Korean, Thailand, Japanese etc) so whenever your in the mood to try something new on the menu... I say go for it! They dont disappoint me that's for sure. It's not the best out there...but they have some pretty good decent stuff if your up for it.   And oh, they have a bar for you drinkers out there. Go get wasted.  I recommend anyone whose in Mississauga to try this one out. Love it or Hate it.. take your pick."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was just as bad.  We ordered shrimp fried rice, shanghai noodles, red chicken curry and sushi rolls. The only good thing was the sushi rolls. Please don't get the shanghai noodles. Its like eating rubber. We couldn't eat any of it. Our waitress had a poor attitude from the beginning and was clearly having a bad day. It was a terrible experience. Avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a group of my coworkers. We had reservations for a large group but unfortunately not everyone was able to come. Upon arriving we were promptly seated and our server was great! He came by very often to make sure we were okay. He brought us menus and asked us if we were ready to order, we wanted to wait so he came back again several times to ask us if we were ready yet. The food was delicious and arrived very quickly after ordering. The prices were super cheap for the quality and taste of the food. I ordered spicy garlic chicken which was on the Chinese main section of the menu. There was so much food I couldn't even finish it all and had to take it home. The menu was really large and had a section of Chinese options as well as Japanese options which was really cool. We stayed here for hours just talking and eating and the waiter was super cool with this even though he probably just wanted to clean off the table. All in all it was an excellent night out and I would highly suggest this pkace!!! Did I mention that my meal only cost 13.99 without tax and tip? Super cheap but delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good service. Excellent food when ordered spicy. Try the Malaysian curry."}
{"text":"This is a really nice looking restaurant with okay food. The ambience is lovely with light latterns hanging across the ceiling and spacious seating. The food was okay, not nearly as good as some other sushi places I've been to however and the prices are quite high in comparison (ie $20 for a dinner Bento box). The portions are good though and I was only able to finish half of my Bento box. I will likely come here again as it's close to my boyfriend's and explore other items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Placed an order for take out. Their web portal indicates cash pick up is 10% off. However you need to spend $25 before tax to get the 10% off.   The order was ready on time. Ordered spicy tuna, shrimp,  salmon rolls.   Mediocre in meat quality and they just put Siracha on the top instead of using a spicy mayo or something else within the roll.   Overall it's just a 3/5* - will continue to search for another sushi option on the west end of Mississauga"}
{"text":"Great place! Wide range selection of Asian cuisine. My fav is green tea ice cream, deep fried spring rolls, gong chow beef ho fun (flat brown noodle), and shrimp fried rice. I always get the same stuff every time I go there because I don't completely like their menu. There's something there for all tastes, check it out! It's a large restaurant with private tables and other tables in the open with TV's in every corner. This place is my go to for take out and when I'm shopping in the area. It's a nice relaxing place with a so-so menu."}
{"text":"Went there once with a couple friends. One got sushi, I got the deep fried pork chops, and another got this shrimp curry business.   It was awful. The service was slow, it was on the pricier side, and ultimately, the food was ghastly.  Overly salty, my pork was so greasy, the curry was so boring, and the sushi... was below even AYCE standards. And expectations weren't even high to begin with.   I won't be going back. Ever."}
{"text":"This was my second time.. the only reason why I go here is that my girlfriend's family lives very close by, to be honest that fried spring rolls was the worst I have ever had in Toronto, it tasted like someone dropped the salt shaker on the spring rolls. sushi was mediocre but  you could get the same for lesser in a lot of places.."}
{"text":"Went today to axia it's was my first time coming here and the service and stuff where amazing and the food is excellent and you need to try the beef teriyaki and I will come back to back here so high recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Axia quite a few times since discovering it a few months ago; and have never been disappointed.  The staff are always friendly and I like it here because I'm very much into Asian cuisine of all sorts, so coming here makes it easy when I'm craving variety. If I want sushi and pad thai in the same meal, then that's what I'll have.   I brought my parents over the weekend and we ordered a few dishes to share; and they were just as impressed as I was.  We started with my favourite appetizer, the chicken & beef satay skewers and spring rolls; had the sushi sashimi maki combo cause my mom needed her sushi fix; Shanghai noodles, and Thai chicken pineapple fried rice for our mains.  We ended the meal with the deep fried Oreos and deep fried Mars bar.  I'm not usually big on sweets, but I can't say no to these deep fried desserts whenever I'm there.  Sometimes if my sweet tooth still isn't satisfied, I'll have a bubble tea for the road.    Axia has definitely been my go-to for the past while and I don't see that changing in the forseeable future."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and were told to pick up the food at 8pm. We ended up having to wait at the restaurant until 8:30 for our food Unacceptable service! The food was good but not worth having to wait that amount of time. My son had the dumplings, General Tao chicken and hubby and I shared the veg green curry. Steamed rice accompanied the mains. It was filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Axia. If you check in with yelp you get a free bbt drink. So make sure you do that! I ordered the chilli chicken and it was so good! The sauce was just right. Spicy but not that spicy. The battered chicken was crispy.  The bento combination for $20 is a good value too since the sushi quality is higher than other cheaper bento lunches.  Overall, you have to know what to order here when you come. With such a large and diverse menu, there will be dishes to avoid. My suggestion is to look at the pictures here and reviews and go with what has been said to be good. CHILLI CHICKEN AHEM. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Disappointed! Surprisingly, people seem to love this place and for a Monday evening, the restaurant was quite busy. However, we weren't being attended to and when I asked, the waitress non-apologetically stated that there were only 2 servers catering to 10-15 tables. Minus points right away! And then came the glasses of water; dirty and scratched all over. Ugh.  The beverages weren't bad. I ordered a mango bubble tea slushie and my parents ordered two different teas. They loved it.   The food cost as much as it would at Spring Rolls or restaurants alike but quality-wise wasn't at par. My beef sizzler was bland, dad's lemongrass pork was too dry; the other people at the table didn't complain but did comment that they had had better.  The restaurant is cozy; lot of plastic plants, lanterns and lights inside that my family and friends didn't seem to mind but I found the decor border-lining tacky.   Oh, and seats aren't comfortable.  Would I go back? Probably not. What's the hubbaloo about this place? Seriously!"}
{"text":"The sizzling beef was absolutely disgusting it tastes like ketchup and bbq sauce its not good. The sushi is awesome The garlic pepper chicken is good! Fried rice also okay... The mango salad and chicken is a 2/5 nothing special Nice atmosphere, service is slow Free bubble tea with check in does not include tapioca they charge extra for that...."}
{"text":"Don't get anything other than the bento cuz it's a ripoff if you must visit this place. The portions (other than bento) are extremely small. Even then, all things on the menu are quite expensive and quality is not actually better than its competitors. I would say it's at the level or a little lower than All You Can Eat sushi. The non-japanese food is  mediocre and not worth the price. The bubble tea is nasty, don't even waste your $8 on it. It's powder mixed with water and very watered down. I couldn't finish it.  Found hair in my bento and in my drink as well. Not impressed.  Service was terrible. We wasted 40 mins waiting for our food. Our waitress was nowhere to be found so it was tough to even get our water filled. She messed up our bills 3 times (we all wanted separate bills) and had to go back and fix it again and again. This process took another 20 mins.  Avoid this place if you can. There are many better places with better prices and better food."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating in, and I've ordered once online. All three times I've had sushi ... and all three times it was disappointing. The rice was warm, dry and overly sticky. The salmon was room temperature. The deep fried oreos were meh. I've had much better. The waiter never asked if I wanted a refill on my pepsi, and only asked how the food was as I was paying.  The only high point from the restaurant was the mango salad I ordered online previously.  All and all, I'd go somewhere else if you're looking for sushi."}
{"text":"Have you ever thought a place was good and later discovered that its really not? My disappointment with a young waitress who forgot to enter my phone order and only did so when I arrived to pick it up, was actually a benefit to me in that I realized a few things about this place and its cleanliness which is so lacking. To understand that, simply have a seat at the bar and look around for a few minutes.  If you do that you will see stacks of cardboard boxes to your left with supplies shoved onto an open shelf. Feed lines from a slushie machine that doesn't look like it had been used or cleaned in years. The area is filled with fruit flies that are circling around leaked syrups and other liquids. If you look to the right you will see tons of wires in spider clumps with old monitors and other discarded but still in place sign technology.   If you see all this in an area that is open to customers, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. The thought of that permeated my thoughts while I tried to eat a mango salad that was prepared with old mangos and a ginger beef dishes that was swimming in liquid and onions with about 8 thin small pieces of beef.  I have eaten there on many occasions where I thought the food was okay; not great but okay. However I usually walk in, go to the assigned table and don't see much of the service areas. After experiencing the sites of the bar area, I vow to never eat at Axia again until they clean up their place. I can't believe they have ever passed a health inspection."}
{"text":"This place had a great atmosphere when you walk in. The decorations are really cute and well thought out. The restaurant itself is really spacious and clean. Our server was nice but the service could have gone a lot faster. There weren't a ton of other people there and it was a mystery to my party why it was taking so long to get our drinks and food.  The food itself has a great Southeast Asian flavor. There's tons of selection on the menu and you can try something from an country whether it be Thailand, Japan or Malaysia. It was really pricey though and that would probably be my biggest deterrent from returning. There wasn't enough bang for my buck.  I tried their Singapore Noodle with pork and shrimp and it was tasty and spicy but it was a little dry. Their desserts were awesome, deep fried cheesecake, fried Mars Bar and some chocolate cake concoction all came with ice cream and whipped cream. I may go back just for the dessert.  Their alcoholic beverages are also really pricey but no surprise there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their black dragon rolls are one of the best sushi I ever ate.  Their staff was also wonderful and kind. My server amy really made my experience enjoyable. I look forward to coming again.  P.s their bubble tea was quite good but not as good as bubble tease."}
{"text":"Axis has quite a large menu with variety of foods. Now I have not tried it all but from what I've ordered I have not been disappointed. Chicken chow mein, spicy salmon rolls, chicken pad thai, bento boxes, miso soup, chicken fried rice. All these dishes are packed with flavour and the portion size is great for what you pay for! They have great daily lunch special options and the whole establishment is just decorated so nicely ! Adds a great feel!"}
{"text":"Our go-to sushi place in Mississauga. We absolutely love it here. And we're here so often that the waitress calls out our order when we walk in, which makes it an even more personal experience. Their salad rolls are absolutely amazing, combined with their spicy mayo.   We get the bento box at lunch sometimes too, which I quite enjoy. I'm not a huge fan of tempura, but the salad is really good. They also make really good bubble tea."}
{"text":"The prices are super cheap, and the meals are okay. Nothing really stood out, and something seriously troubled my stomach....but can't entirely put blame on the restaurant. I don't know if I'd go out of my way to get eat here, but I wouldn't really turn down the offer to go either."}
{"text":"Great- if you know what to order. I personally think that the Thai and Malay food is the best here. I love ordering the Satay Skewers, the Green Curry, and the Pad Thai. Japanese rolls here are good as well.   Look out for online gift-vouchers and save $20."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I highly recommend their sushi rolls and salmon sashimi, some of the best I've had. A bit pricey but worth a try. Service is good- they move fast!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was great. The food was tasty, the staff was polite and friendly, and the decor was very nice. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Don't order sushi.  My hubby got food poisoned after eating their sashimi. When we mentioned to them that the fish did not taste fresh, they didn't do anything to replace the order. I don't think we will go back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Thai green curry is one of the best I've ever tried. Thick consistency and simple. Good amount of chicken. Service is OK, too many menu items gets confusing. Crispy Mongolian beef is pretty good too. I go there almost monthly and they never disappoint with food quality. Staff can be sub-par at times."}
{"text":"I've been to Axia a few times for sushi and it's definitely one of my favourites.  I've only ordered the sushi (they offer all kinds of other Asian dishes too - such as rice and noodle), and it's really good!!  They serve bubble tea as well; the servings aren't big for the prices you pay (about $6), but it's some damn good bubble tea.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere to it - somewhat \"high-end\" as another reviewer mentioned.  The only criticism I have about the restaurant itself is that the particular table I was seated at was very poorly lit.  This might not be an issue for some people, but I found it weird that it was so hard to see my food.  The last time I went (on a Saturday evening), it was quite busy and the service was slow.  My table ordered a main sushi dish to split as an appetizer, and asked if it could be brought before the rest of our food; our server agreed, but brought it out later on - when our main dishes were served.  My miso soup was also brought out much before my order was - I wasn't too thrilled about that, as the soup was lukewarm by the time my food arrived.  The service could definitely have been better, but I would still put up with these minor setbacks to enjoy the awesome food that they serve."}
{"text":"We ordered via Skipthedishes and I have to say the food is amazing! We have a new favourite restaurant.  My favourite was probably the Red Thai Beef curry, the sauce was out of this world. Definitely get their fried rice also, it is super good. Great portions for great prices!"}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago for the first time and was very disappointed with the food..decided to give it a second chance and was even more disappointed today.  Ordered the Tom Yum soup and it was absolutely disgusting..it was definitely not authentic Tom Yum soup. The bowl was filled with broccoli, carrots, beans and other veggies and 2 shrimp..just horrible.  Also ordered the shashimi and the fish looked stale..the snapper was almost yellow in colour..did not eat any of it. Maybe their other dishes are good but I will not return to find out."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place since it came into existence. It's close to where I grew up, thus making dining here convenient. There are many options to choose from. I personally enjoy the Malaysian curry and order it often. Wish they were more generous with the shrimp but all in all, tastes great. Sushi here is also good. Normally, we order the 2 person boat and other dishes (sweet and sour fish, curries, deluxe sushi rolls and salmon sashimi). Bubble tea is hit or miss. Rice tea is good. Their alcoholic beverages are also good."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 25 people and they set up a long table right in the middle. As i sat down, i was quickly asked what id like to drink. And they brought water  as i looked through the drink menu. She also came to check back at a reasonable time so i wasnt forgotten or rushed. Service was amazing for such a large group of people.   The menu was extended! So many things to choose from i had a hard time deciding. They have things from dim sum to korean to thai to japanese. And hearing from everyone at the party, it sounded like everything was amzing.   What i ordered: Spicy salmon rolls California rolls Chicken satay skewers Unagi bento box   The portions were huge! I think almost everyone had leftovers and she packed it up for us.  Overall good experience. I would come back since its in my area. But I wouldn't recommend it if youre looking for something authentic tho."}
{"text":"I've bee here a few times and everytime I've been here the service has been fantastic, and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Before Spring Rolls, Lemongrass, and other assorted modern Canadian-ized Pan Asian cuisine started to crop into the 'burbs', Mississauga received Axia in the Winston Churchill and Eglinton area.  It was the newest explosion of houses being built and the restaurant got a lot of activity.  This restaurant feels like the Asian equivalent of Rainforest cafe.  When you first walk in, you wonder if you stepped into a theatrical stage for Chinatown or the owners went over the top.  Sure there's no lighting but each 'country' cooking area has it's signature building type on top of it and the large tree in the centre looks like something out of a high school musical.  Aside from the crazy decoration, the food is not authentic nor does it tries to be.  It's a mish mash of the most beloved North American versions of each Asian cuisine.  General Tso chicken... yup.  Coconut curry and pad thai... uh huh.  Kalbi ribs.. yesiree.  Teriyaki everything? that too.  The menu is incredibly large and to it's credit, it does the North Americanized fare decently.  The vegetables we had were all fresh so no limpy or yellow broccoli for the typical beef and broccoli.  I would say the dishes lack any good flavour as they're all very strong on the soy sauce and corn starch.  Textures are all good so the cook in the back isn't a horrible one... he's just given a crazy menu to execute and caters towards Canadians.  I'd stick to the cook foods as I find the maki rolls and sushi here not great.  They're fresh but the quality is a bit on the low side so they're more chewier or gummier than they should be. They also love their mayo sauce... ew.  I know some people love mayo on the sushi rolls but this was excessive.  They also really put a lot of rice into the rolls so it's a lot of filler and not as much sushi.  The prices are decent and their lunch menu can be very affordable if you have a small stomach.  The service is ok ... they weren't personable or friendly but they took the order quickly and all the items came hot.  You can't fault them for doing their functions well.    So if you have someone who is new to Asian cuisine (ha... who knows someone like that these days) or you're craving a plethora of Americanized Asian dishes (lol), this might be your bet!  Otherwise, just do a quick search on yelp and I'll guarantee you'll find at least 5 great authentic restaurants of various Asian cuisines within a 10 minute drive."}
{"text":"Our server Hanna is the reason for this update. Excellent service, and food was very good (avocado cucumber rolls, sweet potatoes rolls and okra chilli )."}
{"text":"Meh this place is alright.  It's a fusion of Chinese, Thai, Japanese, and Korean dishes.  Thought this concept was kind of cool.  A co-worker told me about this place and said it was amazing, so I thought I'd try out.    TIP:  When you check-in through Yelp, you get a free bubble tea/milkshake (however, my bubble tea didn't have any tapioca so it was basically just a regular drink lol)  Anyways, the food was average.  They do however, give you a large portion depending on what you order.  We ordered a lot of sushi rolls, and they were pretty good.  My favourite would be the soft shell crab roll.  We also ordered beef udon noodles and that was okay.  Also, the menu can be overwhelming as there is a lot to order from.  I'm an indecisive person, so looking at that menu gave me anxiety lol.  The service was a little slow, our server was flustered most of the time as she was dealing with a lot of tables.  She was really nice and kept apologizing, not her fault the place was busy.  The place itself...well I really thought it would be more elegant looking inside.  I did not expect it to look like a tacky hawaiian themed bar.  Don't think I'll be returning.  It was a good experience but it wasn't a memorable one."}
{"text":"This place is great, they offer 4 different types of asian food: korean, japanese, chinese, or thai.  So there is something here for you if you are craving asian food, or if you're with a group that has mixed tastes when it comes to asian food.   The service is fine, they are prompt and they get the job done.  That's usually what I say about asian customer service in restaurants.  One small thing I didn't like is initially the host sat us at a table in a less than ideal area.  There were plenty of other nice seats available, so this kind of annoyed me.    The inside decor is nice, gives it a good feel.    I recommend this place to anyone who likes asian food.  Derek"}
{"text":"This is the first one-star review that I've written. We went to Axia for lunch on a Wednesday - it wasn't busy and when we arrived, there was only one waiter working. The restaurant was super hot and they could've turned on the fan or some AC. We ordered 4 items from their lunch menu - only one was edible, the red curry chicken. Don't get me wrong, the flavours were all pretty good (on the red curry, general tao chicken, pad thai), but everything was either overcooked (salmon), refried (general tao, the pieces had way more batter than chicken) or undercooked (pad thai noodles). Lunch menu prices ranged from $10-$15. We didn't order any of the bento boxes, and looking around the restaurant, it didn't seem like any of the other patrons did either. The portions looked good when it was served on the table, and while we did have leftovers, it was because I wanted to cook the pad thai noodles some ore when I got home.  The bathroom smelled of urine and musk, even though the restaurant just opened for the day.  The only good thing about my experience was the free bubble tea when you check in on Yelp. What I don't understand is how can such a restaurant of such low caliber manage to stay open for this long in Mississauga? I'm truly stumped."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy writing three-star reviews, and generally try to avoid doing so. For me, Yelp is a place of discovery. It connects me to the things that interest me, and helps me to avoid the things that don't. I don't ever set out to have a three-star night, or a three-star experience, and, for that very reason, I seldom read three-star reviews. With that said, this review was intentionally written to provide what I believe to be constructive criticism.  The advertising worked. From the moment I saw the ad, I knew that this was a place that I'd want to visit before returning to South Florida. And, despite having seen the ad in a magazine just once, I was able to recognise it from a distance, during the night, on a street located in a city I don't live in. And I was quite happy that I'd found it, because I had very little interest in going where we were headed. Kudos to the interior designer. I would describe it as 'Tokyo in a room'. It's modern, it's clean, and it's well lit. Very classy place.  Now if only the food tasted as good. No one in my party of four had anything good to say about anything they ordered, including my aunt--who I believe tried the Pad Thai. My Pepper Udon was quite bland. And though I'd initially thought it a fluke, the opinions of the other members of my party provided additional context upon which I was able to weigh my own opinion. I took it home because I don't like to waste food. (And for that reason only.) After placing it in the refrigerator, I somehow managed to completely forgot about it. I believe that says more about my order than it does my memory."}
{"text":"Not coming back ever!!!! I only gave two stars because the food was decent. However, our waiter wasn't the best. I understand that there's other people but there's no reason for why you should lack in customer service. They didn't give us napkins and we didn't receive glasses of water for about 15 minutes. He didn't come check to see if we were ready to order either. We had to be the one to ask and get their attention. Our food took much more time than it should have, especially since other people who got their food first and we were the ones who were there first. No one came to check on us or refilled our empty waters. And when we did ask for refills, he said \"wait\" who says that? They also had no A/C which made it uncomfortably hot. I would not come back here ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"Chefs seemed to have changed.. It's not the same as before.. Flavor has definitely decreased.. Very disappointed.. Why fix what wasn't broken?"}
{"text":"My family and I love Axia for when we want asian food.  I love that I can order anything off of their menu and not worry about the quality or consistency of the food.  The staff is always really friendly and accommodating (whether dining in, taking out ir delivery).  My favourite is the chicken pad Thai and my husband loves the sushi"}
{"text":"A group of us decided to go for lunch here after a wedding ceremony in the area. I've always wanted to try Axia previously but forgot about it.  Food didn't take too long to arrive for the group of 10 of us. Both my fianc√© and I ordered the bento box for lunch. It was very filling and we were satisfied with our bento box. I really enjoyed the salmon sashimi as it tasted delicious and fresh.   They also have free bubble tea if you check in on Yelp. However, since we had a large group only two people could redeem the free bubble tea.  We didn't realize there was gratuity already included on the bill until after a friend pointed it out. So my fianc√© ended up tipping a total of 30%!  I'd come back here when I'm in the area and I am hungry."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience. Excellent service. Great portions and the food looked great. Only problem - the beef teriyaki was too salty for my liking. My wife ordered the General Tao chicken and felt the same way.   Surprising! Because this place generally excels in terms of food."}
{"text":"Good variety on the menu Decent pricing Delicious food  Good service  Good ambience  The food came out pretty fast The server was friendly & warm Good restaurant"}
