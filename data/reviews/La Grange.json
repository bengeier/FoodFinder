{"text":"Location: Tucked away in Morin Heights, just off the main road. Parking is located at the back and free. 

The place: So the name of the restaurant translates as 'the barn', and for all intents and purposes, it's got a barn-like feel, but think of a souped-up, super modern (clean) version. I loved the space - stone walls, wood floors and decor that is reminiscent of being out in the country 'back in the day.' Think leather saddles, old ski lifts and that sort of thing. We really loved the ambiance - super chill and relaxing. There is a shortage of restaurants in Morin Heights, so this is a welcome addition. 

The goods: There were three of us, and we each got different dishes. I started with the blood pudding served with caramelized apples and celeriac. I really enjoyed this -  the pudding was very flavorful and not dry like some places. The portion was quite large for an appetizer and could probably be shared with another person, though I'd like a little more apple and celeriac. My dad ordered the same starter and he also enjoyed it. As a main, I ordered the linguine with ricotta + lime (the overall texture was like that of pesto). While I liked the dish, I found it to be lacking in flavor, and I couldn't taste the lime at all. It was OK, but not memorable. In terms of the portion, it was fine for me. My dad ordered the linguine with clams in a white wine broth. At first glance, I immediately thought that the dish was going to be disappointing. So... first, the clams were those small white shells with barely any meat in them. I think there were about a dozen of them, if that. The pasta was completely white with a couple of cherry tomatoes here and there. My dad found the dish to be incredibly bland, there weren't enough clams and the portion was small for the price. He wasn't impressed with his choice of mains. My mom's dish was the hit of the evening. She got the braised ribs (veal) with fries and coleslaw. The meat was delicious and falling off the bone, and the fries were crispy and well-seasoned. Her only comment was that the portion of fries could be larger, and that if a man ordered this dish, the rib portion probably wouldn't be satisfying enough.  I'm the only one who had dessert - an almond/raspberry cake. It was good. 

Service: The service was great. The wait staff were friendly and attentive and our water glasses were never empty. 

Price point: While I like the restaurant itself, I don't really think the food or portions can justify the price point.The table d'hote (this includes an appetizer + main + dessert) was $30 (based on what I ordered). The other two dishes were about $26 each and didn't include anything else. If the food was outstanding, then I might be OK with these prices, but the reality is that I can order a pasta dish in town, for about half the price and way more flavor (not to mention bigger portions). I went in there with high expectations but left feeling disappointed. The total bill for 3 including one glass of wine + 2 coffees/1 tea + tip was $140."}

Nous avons bien mangé. Les plats et les desserts étaient bons ! Le décor est aussi original. Prix un tout petit peu elevé.

A essayer !"}
