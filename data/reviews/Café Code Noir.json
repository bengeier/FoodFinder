{"text":"Coffee is a lot better than the standard in Montreal. A quiet place with nice music, good for studying and spending time with friends."}
{"text":"I asked for an americano and I have come to expect the usual decent black coffee everywhere (except for the bigger chains) and to my surprise I was given a large cup with a shot of espresso and hot water on the side. I might add that the coffee was amazing.. Just the right amount of bittersweet. The staff are very amicable too. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Smooth, dense espresso with the right balance of sweet and tangy. Cool hipster vibe with a decent amount of seating. Best of all, they carry almond milk, which sets them apart from LA's bougie Intelligentsia. A definite must for the coffee connoisseur who finds themselves in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent cafe! This is the best cappuccino I've had in The Plateau."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The barista was so chill and friendly. Another wasn't even working that shift and was sitting enjoying her own cup of coffee, yet when she got up to bus her table she picked up my dishes as well! Felt very comfortable here and I got a lot of work done. The food wasn't bad, pretty fresh. The coffee was better. Tried several things and nothing disappointed. Will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Un chouette endroit où se réchauffer du froid et pour bosser?! En effet, en plus de servir du bon café, thé et des petites salades, l'endroit est propice a une bonne ambiance de travail calme. D'ailleurs il y'a autant de Laptops sur les tables que de tasses de café?!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large take-out green tea that cost 3.75$ and took 10 minutes to infuse. When I came back 10 minutes later, the guy forgot to put the hot water into my 'infusion'. So I waited another 10 mins. 20 mins for a tea to go. It was also a size small comparatively. I'm done with trends when it comes to tea. Leave it as it is. Put a bag in hot water for me. And give me more hot water if I want it. And charge me way less. And make a large a large. Oh, and the music sucks. Rant over."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance et les meilleurs lattés de Montreal"}
{"text":"Stopped in today on a fluke and was so impressed. Have lived in Australia for the last 14 years and mentioned to the owner that the coffee and atmosphere reminded me of the cafes in Melbourne....funnily enough I was told that Code Black has Australian links! The owner was extremely friendly and showed me and my partner around the  beautifully designed shop. Wish they were located in Ottawa as I am desperate for a great coffee venue!"}
{"text":"Le café était trés bon, cependant un peu tiède. Le service était bien. Le décor est très beau mais pas trop chaleureux. La musique est presque absente, ce qui rend l'ambiance un peu ordinaire. 

Sandwich un tantinet trop cher à mon avis. 

Si je suis proche, je vais probablement y retourner, mais ça ne sera pas une destination."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place...excellent machiatto that packs a powerful punch. Good atmosphere and music, this place is miles better than other cafes in the area. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the nasty attitude of the owners. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"i don't know much about coffee so i can't really say much except the soy latte i had tasted average... but i really enjoyed the atmosphere! 

it's very hipster with a distinct hipster crowd, high ceilings and minimalist furnishings (they have cool lights that stem from the walls)

this would be a good place to study because it's very spacious and has a pretty relaxing vide... i would recommend they turned down the music just a little though"}
{"text":"Il importe guère qu'un commerce soit une franchise australienne venue des antipodes, cela ne garanti aucunement la qualité de votre expérience. Le Code Black a une devanture très design, mais à sa vue il est bien difficile de dire s'il s'agit d'un café ou d'une entreprise quelconque, le design de son logo faisant un peu peur, avec sa tête de mort antillaise (ou est-ce une cagoule à mauvaise dégaine?) Il faut jeter un coup d'oeil à l'intérieur pour constater qu'au contraire, il s'agit d'un environnement joli, froid et sophistiqué, où les accros du café du voisinage viennent assouvir leur besoin dans une ambiance dont l'odeur a une très forte concentration de caféine. 

Problème de respect

Malheureusement, l'entreprise ne nous a pas semblé avoir la force de son ambition, malgré les phrases accrocheuses et l'effort évident mis sur le design. L'ambiance demeurait froide, le décor avait un contact un peu trop plastifié et le café, quoique joliment apprêté, nous a été servi anormalement tiède.

Mais cela ne fut rien en comparaison à la tiédeur du service, tout d'abord en français, mais devenu obstinément unilingue anglais pendant le service et à la sortie. Le personnel souffre du mal dont beaucoup de commerces du centre-ville est pris, refusant de parler en français à la clientèle, répondant de façon éhontément irrespectueuse à des clients venant dépenser leurs sous à son enseigne, clientèle adressant nécessairement la parole en français au personnel. Insultés, nous nous sommes dit que Code Black n'avait finalement pas grand chose d'intérêt à nous offrir. De toute façon, le coin offre plusieurs alternatives, dont l'excellent Laïka où nous aimons bruncher ou égrener nos après-midis, la main soudée à une tasse d'excellent café. 

Le \" code noir \" du café

Au-delà de son attitude pseudo-rebelle associée à une soi-disant image de marque noire et mystérieuse, associant l'expérience du connaisseur aux arcanes de la magie noire ou vaudoue, Code Black devrait \" arriver en ville \", réorienter son approche sur l'expérience client, et traduire son respect dans sa raison sociale. 

Pour la petite histoire, \"Code noir\" tient ses racines au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles de la France de Louis XIV et de Louis XV, une expression désignant la législation régissant notamment l'esclavage dans les Antilles françaises."}
{"text":"Good coffee, location, decoration, staff. The kind of crowd you'd easily picture backpacking through hostels."}
{"text":"Really cool hipster atmosphere. I was a little put off by the moody exterior but the inside was spacious and well lit. Wood everything. The coffee was decent."}
{"text":"So this bar is a chain out of Australia, they only have a few locations, as far as I know. That said, it is a good bar, though not exceptional. For some reason I often feel the staff is stressed when the boss is around, and perhaps a bit too relaxed when he's not? They do make good espresso drinks, though, and if you can afford one of the 5$ guten free brownies from Juliette+ Chocolat, it's a worthy pairing.

They serve Phil n Sebastien, which I like but don't love. The real plus is the good WiFi and ample seating area with nice clean flat tables that are conducive to prductivity. There's also an attractive shared table at the front that faces St-Laurent via a full height window. I also never feel rushed to leave and they're open till 7, so a solid 4*"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and I fell in love with their coffee. Their coffee is very smooth and delicious. The atmosphere was very chill. They had great music playing in the background (if you like the Black Keys, you should come here)."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dans ce café car il était recommandé sur un blog. Eh bien je suis déçue. Le cappuccino était bon mais sans plus. 

Je n'ai pas trop aimé la musique qui était plutôt lounge pour un café où on veut travailler. 

Le décor simpliste manquait de charme. On n'a pas le goût d'y passer des heures. Bref, rien d'exceptionnel."}
{"text":"Amazing little coffee joint on Saint Laurent! We enjoyed an Americano and expressl while people watching, a must see!"}
{"text":"Good macchiato. A bit acidic, but well balanced with soya milk (I am lactose intolerant but I personally like the nutty flavor that soya or almond milk adds). The barista also made a cute heart shape.

Quiet and chill. Lots of outlets for people w/ laptops or whathaveyous.

I was thinking about heading over to Cafe Neve but got dissuaded by the weather.

No regrets thus far. :-)"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping on the streets of Saint Laurent, me and my two friends decided to try Code Black. We were very satisfied with the service we received. Everyone was extremely friendly and gladly explained everything that went into their products. The lattes are amazing and the chocolate banana croissants are out of this world. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service. Really cool interior design and local art! Try the chicken avocado panini!"}
{"text":"Location: On the main between Duluth and Rachel. The closest subways are probably St. Laurent (green) and Mont-Royal (orange), however I'm always walking so check first, if you're using transit. Street parking available [metered].

The place: Nice space - very simple, urban, cozy. They have a great little terrace that I was able to enjoy when I stopped by. 

The goods: GREAT coffee. They use Phil & Sebastian beans - I'd never tried these guys before but I immediately fell in love with them, at first sip. Very tasty, not bitter at all. I had a Macchiato. The barista basically made me the perfect cup of coffee. 

Service: Good. 

Price point: I think the Macchiato was $2.75 but I'm not sure. the beans were $18.

This is my new favourite spot (after Olimpico, of course). Check it!"}
{"text":"Excellent espresso sourced from Phil & Sebastians. Bagels from St.Viateur. What more could you ask for? Service was good. Try a traditional macchiato to get a sense of the coffee quality."}
{"text":"The perfect office cafe workspace away from home. Coffee is great. It actually tastes unique instead of the stuff you get at generic franchise coffee shops. Friendly French speaking staff with basic English skills."}
{"text":"Sam at Cafe Code Noir is a sweetheart. He welcomed us and treated us to delicious baked goods. The baklava and chocolate croissant were my favorite. Tea and lattes are excellent as well. Thanks Sam!"}
{"text":"worst espresso I have ever had. A year ago I came in because the next door shop wouldn't accept a $100 bill, and I had to change it. I came here, got an espresso, and they graciously accepted the $100 bill, but the coffee was terrible. Even though I lived close by for the next 9 months, I never came back."}
{"text":"Nope, do not recommend.. again if your servers don't want to actually serve coffee and really hate the job it makes me not want to come there...forgetting That were forgetting forgetting orders then making me wait for 10 minutes on a regular cup of coffee, seems amateurish in comparison to better cafes like Neve and even Patati Patata, where I think I should have gone too instead, sorry."}
{"text":"A lovely place, with a knowledgeable staff and wonderful coffee! People are working away in their laptops with funky music in  the background (not tool loud). 

They had this amazing cranberry white chocolate biscuit! Mmmm! 

The coffee is from Phil Sebastien Coffee Roasters in Calgary, and oh sooo good!"}
{"text":"Can I get a raise of hands (both hands) for excellent customer service?
They can make anybody smile and say \"wow, thank you\". 
The employee receiving my order was being trained, but she was very warm from the beginning, maybe 'cause she just started working there. Anyway, I was pleased with the full-on attention she gave me. Everything she did was done with a smile. To the employer/manager there, you made a terrific hiring decision. The other woman on the same shift poured me a glass of water, without me asking her, and brought it to my table. Never before have I had an unordered glass of water brought to me at an actual cafe! It was NICE! 

I had a chocolatine and a small latte ($4), and paid a total of $6.90. The chocolatine was better than the McGill cafeteria ones. The right amount of chocolate and the right amount of flakiness. The latte tasted much differently from the lattes I've had in Montreal, but in a good way. I would say it was stronger than an average latte. I can't complain though. It gave me the boost to start and finish a cover letter in one go, and the latte art was pleasant to look at. 

And as some other reviewer mentioned, the WiFi is incredibly fast here, uncommonly so. Therefore it automatically makes Cafe Code Black an ideal place to study or to muse over business data with a co-worker. The tables are kept very clean too."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and Brie sandwiches, great moccacinos, and very friendly service. Excellent pastries too, though some of the best were in short supply. Seating a bit limited, but wasn't especially crowded so that wasn't as issue for us."}
{"text":"With a name like that, I was expecting something new in terms of vibe and space design. But... Nope. But this isn't Architectural Digest so, you're right, on to the goods.

Coffee was meh. 
Pastries seem meh.
Staff is super nice.

It's not a place that seems to put pride in the product. Instead, it was all kinda blasé. Wouldn't make my list of must trys."}
{"text":"Good fruit smoothie (it tasted of strawberry, raspberry, orange, and perhaps a few other fruits too). Could be stronger in the fruity taste but still good and refreshing in this hot humid weather."}
{"text":"Large, spare cafe with very good espresso that is reminiscent of, though not equal to, Pikolo's (in my view the best in the city). Perhaps because they are using Phil & Sebastian beans (which I often see at Pikolo) while they consider how to bring in Australian beans. Fancy milk from Société-Orignal. Very good pastry; wifi that is uncommonly quick to connect and fast for a Montreal cafe; pleasant staff. Lots of stable, amply sized tables with schoolroom chairs. Peaceful for now but will be interesting to reassess once traffic picks up. Vibe and clientele is polished hipster: sparklier than Pikolo, less actor/model than Arts Cafe or Couteau."}
{"text":"Un coffee très sympathique, avec une bonne ambiance. 
Les employés sont très accueillant et les prix sont assez abordable"}
{"text":"I had the vegan blueberry lavender cheesecake and the chai latte. The latte was good, and the cheesecake surprisingly creamy, but it didn't really taste of anything but coconut (which I think is what the cheese was). There was a hit of lavender right at the end but that was about it :(

Still, I like this cafe. It's relatively quiet, open late (and on a Sunday!) with a good selection of drinks and food. Always been plenty of space, too!"}
{"text":"In a pinch this place is a reliable option for getting caffeinated. Good quality coffee, nice treats with the occasional gluten-free options. The atmosphere is quite nice, but my main complaint is it's usually quite noisy and I wouldn't consider it a very relaxing place to go for coffee."}
{"text":"Bel intérieur c'est sûr, ça fait du bien de voir un nouveau café sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent, mais le service était ok, sans plus, j'étais le seul client en après-midi pendant une journée en janvier..., bof pour un nouveau café, j'imaginais plus de monde..., Comme mentionné ci bas, un peu froid comme place.....lorsque je suis parti même pas de merci/au revoir.... Latté + croissant = 6.25$. J'y retournerai d'ici quelques temps pour voir et ré-évaluer encore une fois. Wifi gratuit pour travailler sur place."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times but I love the place. The decor and atmosphere is cool, and there is plenty of space to find a spot. The music is nice and there's also a lot of plugs if you happen to need it. Their coffee is really good too, and the baristas always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great coffee house, with a good bagel to boot! The owner is super friendly, as is the staff. That said, the coffee is ground and brewed fresh (any beans ground and left for longer than 10 minutes are tossed out! - which is wonderful for customers). They also offer barista training; not too shabby a place if you just want to hang out while chilling out."}
{"text":"Love this place the atmosphere is actually so calming and relaxing and it's such a fun place to be in and the barista wasn't Bad either, I sat outside with my dad and also brought something to read from inside, such a great environment. I had a latte and bagel for lunch , and my dad had a salad with his latte ( weird mix ) I loved the design he made on the lattes it was so creative! Definitely going again soon."}
{"text":"Phil & Sebastian's Coffee?!  In Quebec!?  Unheard of!   We had to stop in!

I had an almond croissant and it was to die for.    This cafe is very cute, with welcoming decor.  The service was friendly, and the music was lovely.

Great experience."}
