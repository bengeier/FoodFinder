{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week. I absolutely loved it. Being a vegan it is very hard to find places that have options for me as far as cheese and meats go. But at The Pizza Kitchen, they had everything that I could want. For $2 more I was able to get Vegan Cheese and Vegan meats on my pizza and all the veggies I wanted! It was so delicious. My mother and I really enjoyed it, so much that we came back the next day to get more pizza.The pizza was fantastic! The customer service was really great as well! Everyone was very helpful and had genuine conversation with us while we waited for our pizza to finish baking! It was great! I will definitely come back to The Pizza Kitchen and bring others! The drive is so worth it! Can't wait for them to expand across the Vegas Valley!"}
{"text":"Super nice kids that work there, but OMG are they slow ! Lunchtime is busy- should be ready. You should have an assembly line. Be efficient. Everybody standing around watching the same thing happen. It's maddening! Same thing 3x's now. Pizza good, but might take an extra 10 min drive to competitor at this rate."}
{"text":"Really, truly good pizza is hard to find for some reason. So... glad I found The Pizza Kitchen. I've eaten here twice and both times left with a belly full of fresh made, tasty pizza.  Love this place - it's a place you have to add to your \"must eat there\" list."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza experience I have had in a long time. I loved the fact you can build your own personal pizza and they cooked in 3 minutes. The staff was also very friendly!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Staff is always awesome! Great place to grab a pie with a friend."}
{"text":"Really, really wanted to like it...........but was a horrible experience. 
After Custom Built on Grand Canyon and Flamingo closed down last year, I was really looking forward to a new build-your-own pizza place to replace them.

Similar to Pieology, you can add as many toppings as you want for one price, $7 per pizza. Similar to Pieology, it is cafeteria-style. Not alot of personality on the walls, Pieology at least has some fun quotes to read while you wait for your pizza.

First, they don't hand toss their dough, so the crust was just okay. They were pre-done, maybe even frozen?? Didn't see a dough press so might be the case and the resulting cardboard crust.
Sauce, several options to choose from, the marinara was okay.

Here are the two big issues and why I will not waste my money by going back:
1. They dont have a pizza oven, they have something similar to Quiznos - a conveyor style rack that \"heats\" the pizza and melts the cheese. How can you possibly expect good pizza without a real oven???

2. \"Unlimited toppings\". I wanted pepperoni, mushroom, peppers and jalapenos. I got 7 pepperoni (even after asking for more please), exactly six mushrooms, scant amount of sliced peppers and five jalapenos.

How disappointing. I didn't even get a bite of each topping on each slice. Wrong place to be skimpy guys, wrong place. Especially when you advertise \"unlimited\".

I will have to keep looking for a good custom built pizza I guess."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! Eat here probably 2-3 times a week and they never disappoint. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Pizza toppings are always given in a good amount and good price. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Normally I like cyo pizzas. I saw an employee sneeze and not wash his hands. I then saw him handle an order. The food is great with great timing. Hopefully health codes could be more strongly enforced"}
{"text":"I'm in love!!! Being from LA I had a regular build your own pizza place and now I have the Pizza Kitchen!!! It's amazing, unlimited fresh toppings, and you can also choose your dough and sauces. My favorite was the artichoke hearts on my little pizza!! Yay can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"For starters, there is no way this is a sustainable business model if they are going to staff this with two kids doing everything.  I don't know if this is their typical staffing level, however they were only moderately busy and these kids were struggling to keep up.  To their credit, both kids were super friendly, professional, and were hustling. 

This is another entry into the fast food pizza genre, however they are trying to do it on the cheap, and it doesn't necessarily work.  Everything is a bit amateurish - the decor, the homemade sign, the Walmart plastic tables, the scuffed walls and no soap in the bathroom, etc.

All this would be easily forgivable if the pizza was great, but the pizza is most definitely not great.  I'm actually stunned to see so many people raving about the food quality - it's why I tried the business and I'm disappointed.  

The wide variety of ingredients, sauces, and cheeses is nice, however you simply can not get past how the pizza is prepared.  The dough is rolled out, the pizza prepped, then it is passed through a toaster oven.  It's the same way a pizza is prepared at a concession stand at a little league field or a bowling alley kitchen.  This business didn't invest in a proper pizza oven, and consequently you get a pizza with a poorly cooked crust that doesn't have the full bodied flavor of a wood fired or brick oven.  

I really wanted to like this place, but there is no way I would return unless they changed things up.  If I'm going to do pop-up pizza, I'll go back to the far superior Pizza Rev."}
{"text":"Wow by far one of the best pizzas we had! Smart to make such a cheap deal, everyone ordered their one pie. Love that ingredients were fresh. I felt healthy after eating pizza, where as I usually feel weighed down or lethargic. Super friendly staff which in itself deserves another bonus star! Highly recommended. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It's, fresh - made to order right in front of you; same style as Chipotle, Cafe Rio, etc., but for pizza.  It's reasonably priced - one size, $7.99, unlimited toppings.  Finally, it's not bad.  It's not gourmet, but it's a decent pizza, especially for the price.  Most importantly, it's not greasy.   

Overall, if you're in the area & want a quick, decent, fresh pizza for under $10.00, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious. I would get a touch less sauce and a bit more cheese next time but the crust is great and he service is spot on. 

Two tips for the owner: teach the guys how to push the sauce out from the center of the pizza so that it is even... And I would love to see Frank's Red Hot Sauce next time I come. Easy fixes. Good joint. Try it tonight."}
{"text":"Friendly staff..great tasting and quality pizza..I was very impressed for my first time.  And very clean place to eat"}
{"text":"Great pizza place with very friendly staff.

Reasonably priced with great toppings. Also, they offer 3,4 types of dough. Definitely will be visiting often!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza and superb customer service
Highly recommend will come back again. A+++"}
{"text":"Flat out amazing! 
Hard to eat an entire pizza. But it's too good to warm it up later. 
Best place to eat in the SW for sure."}
{"text":"We were at this pizza place 3 or 4 times within the last 2 or 3 months.  We love their pizza. The place is clean, friendly staff and it's only 2 minutes away from our house."}
{"text":"Great pizza, very fresh ingredients! They also have the best gelato. So fun making your own pizza!"}
{"text":"Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful!  Place is clean and food was AMAZING!!!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Wow, we absolutely loved this place! Great price $8 per pizza with unlimited toppings. Very light but filling and our young kids loved it as well. Alfredo sauce with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, craisins (trust me), and avocado- delectable! My hubs had the wings and really liked them. He said they were a good hot, not a wow my mouth is on fire and hurts hot. He licked the bones clean! We will absolutely be regulars"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Super easy process. I recommend putting extra garlic on the pizza. Soooo good. Just moved in down the street, this is now my go to pizza spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ingredients are always fresh and the service is awesome, kind and courteous."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD. I am definitely a lifetime customer. And I will bring my friends and family here! Unlimited toppings?!?! I'm use to just one! And with that price!! You can't beat it. I went there for lunch today. Best. Decision. Ever. I just wish they were closer to me! I live in old henderson. They're in summerlin!! I'd be going there 3 times a week or more if I could. I call it a healthier pizza version of subway! They have all their ingredients laid out just like the chain \"fresh alternative\" fast food. Plus it's cheaper. My friend and i spit it. I ate my half in 5 minuets or less. And im a slow eatter!!! And i wanted more! THEY HAVE VEGAN CHEESE!!!!!!!!!! I can't stop thinking about that cheese! I get sick off of dairy so I can't really eat cheese. But it was so creamy! So I put, basil pesto, traditional pie, vegan cheese, chicken, mushrooms, Italian sausage, spinach, red onion, tomatoes and I think that's about it. And it was the best pizza I've ever had. I'm very impressed. Very clean. Love how it's a local joint. And not a  chain restaurant. It's a very cute place to go."}
{"text":"Super good and super friendly!  We go here once a week!!  The pizza is perfect for one or to share.  Unlimited toppings allows you personalize any pizza you want!"}
{"text":"Awesome, love this place. A better replacement for Custom Built Pizza, which is no longer more.

Flat $7.99 for traditional crust, and pretty much unlimited toppings? Perfect size for individual portion, or enough for leftovers too. A really wide selection of meats and veggies... nitrate free pepperoni is a plus.

The staff is nice and I feel like they take care in making your pizza just how you want it. 

Thankfully I've been in during times where I was the only person ordering, but I could see how during busy times, the line could get backed up and slow. But hey, that's not really their fault."}
{"text":"Great pizza, prices and super friendly staff!             Had a vegan pizza and it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Customize your own 12\" pizza... so many topping choices and it's fresh and ready in about 5 mins. Vegan and gluten free options are a huge plus. I also highly recommend the gellato. The staff was helpful and friendly. I was surprised there weren't many people in the place, but it made for a pleasant dinner environment!"}
{"text":"We've passed so many times that we just had to try it. Let me tell you, we were not disappointed. Friendly attentive service, good quality ingredients makes for great spot for pizza. I highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"First off, let me say pizza is my favorite food. So for me to give a place 5 stars on their pizza it must be really good or I must be really drunk and anything tastes good. It is 1 in the afternoon and I am completely sober. You're not going to find a better deal on pizza. For $7.99 you get unlimited toppings. Any other pizza place, I'd probably pay about $30 for the amount of toppings I got. I got the traditional crust with red sauce. Toppings were house blend cheese, pepperoni, spicy sausage, sriracha chicken, roasted garlic, spinach, mushrooms, olives, and extra cheese on top of all of that. It only takes 3 min to bake and comes out perfect. Good music playing in the background and the restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly and service was quick. I am definitely coming back to try the other crusts and sauces."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizzas are delicious and i love that its made exactly how i want it, but what i love the most is the service. Every time I walk into this place , i just feel soo welcome and the friendly servers sincerely make my day. A lot of places i go to , servers smile and all, but here is different, i actually feel that they are genuine. Good job!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff! I was greeted by a very charismatic employee upon entry. The interior decor is inviting with fun artwork throughout the establishment.

My Pizza Kitchen experience began with the gluten-free dough which made for an AMAZING crust!  There's a handful of sauces to choose from, I chose house-made red sauce. It is delicious!  With the option of unlimited toppings, this is a pizzanista's dream come true.  

My toppings went something like this... Red onion, mushroom, roasted pepper, pepperoni, bacon, and avocado. Yes, avocado! 

I was advised to take a seat and in about two minutes, my bespoke pizza was served to my table and ready to embark on my very first Pizza Kitchen dining experience.

It was so good, I decided to order more pizza pies to take to a 4th of July party for all my friends to try. 

Highly recommended for all you pizza enthusiasts a wide."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great concept, cheap, easy and quick. Service is always very friendly and consistent. Food is like a \"chipotle\" or \"subway\" but for pizzas. Tons of toppings to choose from and you build your own for $8. I'm hooked on the whole wheat crust, spicy marinara sauce, house blend cheese, sriracha chicken, garlic, bell peppers, and spinach. I got it on my first time and I do every time now. Yes-- it's that good."}
{"text":"I stumbled across them by mistake on grubhub, I was just going to order some appetizers but I saw that they had...vegan toppings for pizza. I was blown away.

Not only do they offer VEGAN PIZZA! Yes! They have vegan cheese (very good tasting by the way), vegan sausage and chicken. They also offer the most delicious gluten free crust I have ever had. Absolutely phenomenal, a very wide selection of toppings. I am beyond surprised that I could find a pizza place that caters to picky eaters such as myself . You guys have just earned a new loyal customer. 

Finally a place that cares about people's food preferences and makes them with excellence. Wish them the best."}
{"text":"I took two of my kids here for lunch after selling Girl Scout cookies. At first we thought it would be the same as Pie Ologie- turns out is WAY better! They have some great toppings, one of my favorites was the roasted garlic. I made a mixed version of several of their sauces together to make a delicious base to my many toppings. The BEST compliment I can give them was from my 12 year old son who is Gluten Intolerant... He said their crust was crispy and delicious, which is a difficult find in pizzas. We can't wait to come back and eat here with the whole family."}
{"text":"Huge bang for your buck. 12\" pizza, unlimited toppings, 7 min cook time and all for under $10. Crust was crispy and there was a wheat crust option. Took in (3) basketball teams and the they pushed over 30 pizzas through the oven in 20 min."}
{"text":"Starting to go down. The Caucasian kid it's not as personable as the usual staff. I had to tell the guy to put a little more pesto sauce after I noticed he tried to stretch it out to the point where I see a lot of white from the crust. The pizza crust is not crispy, especially for thin crust and I tried less toppings this time. It's too bad because the whole concept of this place is good and been my #1 go to spot for some quick food."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! I met one of the owners, Kelly, who visited my store. We got to talking and she told me about her place. I said I would check it out and grab dinner at her Pizza Kitchen. Sorry for the 4's, but I tend to love plush dough crust and here its more of a thin crust. Don't get me wrong the pizza is fantastic! And for the price, spectacular. $7.99 unlimited toppings. Where could you go wrong??? And they serve gelato!"}
{"text":"It's mine and my family's first time here and I'm extremely disappointed. We were a little worried pulling up because there was not a single car or person in the restaurant. We walk in and we see in the back that there was a young man sitting on one of the tables in the kitchen and a girl standing with him. He jumps down and says hey to us and we explain that it's our first time here and he just rushes us through the line. I personally go to blaze pizza and they ask if you want a crust and how much sauce you want. I had my pesto packed on and all the way to the end of the crust. 
All of my toppings were stacked on top of each other in the center of my pizza. Same for my family. The staff was very rushy and not very pleasant.

I'm very disappointed that I spent $38 here for pizza I regret getting. I will not recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is popping 5 stars.  You can get a LARGER pizza @ da P-HUT, Papa's & Dom's tastes the same... These pie's are smaller and tastes the same to me... Im just saying really 5 star they dont even have Seafood as an option..... UNI PIZZA is my favorite! YUM'Z !!  I'm just saying they have it in JAPAN aka J-PAN....  I approve this message J K KUHL PIZZA X MAN..."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and i must say it was delicious and i like that the price is just right. My co-workers and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I don't know how they offer such a great product for $7.99 unlimited topping 12\". Seems to go to be good, but it wasn't. Encourage more people to try Pizza Kitchen because I want them to stay in business."}
{"text":"Staff needs more training. No fig for the \"fig and prosciutto\"he speciality pizza. So, they offered to sub pesto and not charge for the prosciutto. Nice, however they charged me anyway.  No lids for the cups.....really. Get ready for business!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool made to order pizza. Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. Not an original idea, but rare to find in a pizza joint. Decor is too bland; obviously they wanted you to come in and out quickly, hence the short time to get your pizza ready, which is not a bad thing if you are in a hurry. But it feels more like a sandwich place than a pizza place. Staff I dealt with were very friendly.Not the place to expect the best quality pizza, but for the price and speed of preparation, you have to let go of some other qualities I guess. Still, it is a very decent tasting pizza, and thin enough so you don't feel like you are eating too much (but this is also how they save in costs). Atmosphere is not that great; you feel more like in a hospital cafeteria than in an Italian eatery. Overall, I would go again and recommend it but not for best taste pizza in town, more for the speed and price...."}
{"text":"I had a taste for pizza one night and looked at the offers for competitors in the area, but they all had deals where you had to take two mediums for $7.99 each when all I really wanted was one pizza. I found this place by word of mouth and went after reading reviews.

Was the pizza good...eh, it took care of the taste for pizza. It looked like what pizza should taste like. The crust was pre-made, any number of toppings you could ever want and its all ready in 3 minutes. Would I go back? Probably not. Everything about the place felt sterile as if the concept was cooked up by someone with no imagination for design or a person who thought \"What would pizza look like if it was invented in the Americas by an accountant?\". The format is so cookie cutter it removes all of the joys, culture, history of pizza and smells of Italian food. This place can be a Subway in a hospital, but at least Subway smells like bread and food. This place smelled like nothing. 

The price was great, the service was excellent and the store was clean, but sometimes you can have all that and the food just not deliver. Id hate for this trend of restaurants to catch on and dumb down the palate of Americans."}
{"text":"New favorite lunch spot. The staff is very friendly and the wait is not long at all. I like to try different toppings on my pizza each time. They once forgot to add sundried tomatoes after my pizza was done but it was still delicious.  And it's a $3 up charge for gluten free crust."}
{"text":"I AM OBSESSED WITH THE PIZZA KITCHEN!

Everything is perfect about this place -- the crust, the toppings, the service, the atmosphere, and the price!  

Assembling pizzas in a Subway/Chipotle-esque format and having it prepared for you in less than five minutes has become very trendy recently.  I know that pizzas cooked in woodburning ovens are also very trendy, but my personal preference is to eat pizzas that aren't burnt.  That is where the Pizza Kitchen has perfected their pizza.  The pizza is prepared efficiently and the crust is crispy, without being burnt.  

My personal favorite pizza here is the Hawaiian pizza (I may be biased because I am from Hawaii), but I love the combination of the savory BBQ sauce, sweet pineapples, and salty pulled pork.  The Fig & Prosciutto is also delicious, if you are looking for something a little more unique.

All of the toppings taste extremely fresh, and they offer a few healthy options as well (e.g. wheat crust).  I love how the pizzas are fully customizable, so you can direct them to add more/less based on your preferences.  The restaurant itself is really cute and is a great place to spend time with friends even after enjoying your pizza.  If you have room for dessert, they also serve a selection of gelato!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! This place may be new but they got the right stuff!! I love everything about this place, they are the first make your own pizza place that has wings, so kudo's there! Their crust is so good and flavorful, i don't know what they put in their sauce but i could drink the stuff...lol I love how fresh the toppings are and that is one of the secrets to a great pizza is the freshness of the toppings. They have gelato as well to finish off your meal. The place is always clean when we go in to eat, the staff are friendly and greet you when you walk in and thank you for dinning there. I really hope this place stays around for a long time, another bonus is it takes like less than 5 mins to get your food so if you are on lunch this place is where you need to be."}
{"text":"Pizza was Delicious!  Fresh ingredients, great selection to choose from for your sauces and toppings,  customer service was awesome. Nice decor,  great atmosphere. I found out it is locally owned which is a nice change from all the franchise pizza places, and you can taste the difference with the quality of ingredients. 
Will definitiely return!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Pieology, Pizza Rev and here. This is by far one of the best! They are so friendly and the servings are very generous. They have a lot to more choices then Pieology I would definitely recommend The Pizza Kitchen."}
{"text":"Super good pizza place!! Wether you want to just relax and dine in and hang out with friends, which is what I did, or are in a rush and just wanna grab a quick bite to eat with your pizza made fresh right in front you in just a few minutes. Custom made to your liking. You have a choice of either white, wheat, or even gluten free dough. Lots of selection of sauces and toppings that not a lot of other pizza places have. I loved that they had kale pesto, which is obviously what I got, but they also had marinara, Alfredo, ranch, buffalo.. And I forget if they had any other ones, they might have. For toppings, again LOTS of choices. From the cheeses, to meats, and veggies, a perfect amount of selection. What I got was the kale pesto sauce, with mozzarella cheese, bacon, sundried tomatoes, spinach, and garlic. The place looks nice and fresh looking too which gives the feel of fresh ingredients about to be used to make your fast but still super good pizza at a great price. I forgot to take a picture, but go in and see for yourself. It's PRETTY good."}
{"text":"Excellent service, very nice & helpful. I love a thin crust & theirs was spot on. Just enough toppings to create a wonderful meal. I ordered the 12\", $9.84 Wow what a great price. Ingredients were fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"This place STILL ROCKS as my favourite Pizza joint in town.  I moved to Henderson a few months ago so I have to drive all the way accross town to get it... and it is absolutely worth the drive!  I figure a closer but lesser Pizza is just not going to happen.  I love this place and will continue to go back... and often!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been into this place, they don't have all of the ingredients to make their own pizzas, which seems like really poor management. 

I went into the Pizza Kitchen on Monday, ordered the Fig & Prosciutto pizza which comes with arugula, and as the pizza was coming out of the oven, they inform me, \"We don't have any arugula, is that ok?\"

...no.

No, it's not ok for you to sell me something incorrectly and then after I've paid for it, mention that what I ordered is not the thing which I will receive. 

Nope. Not ok. I need a refund. 

So the guy supposedly gives me a refund, but today I looked at my bank account and the $12.74 charge is still there, with no process of a refund happening. 

Can't make pizza, and taking money from me? 

Never, never, never again, Pizza Kitchen. 

Never."}
{"text":"I do not review restaurants often, but this place was new, and was so great, that I had to share. I was welcomed right as I walked in, very clean, open space. They have a menu board, but it isn't really necessary. It is almost like a Subway, but for pizza. I chose a wheat dough, which I came to found out, they make in house. An assortment of toppings, I couldn't believe the amount of toppings to choose from. A girl named Samantha was very helpful and very cheerful, made me a Great Pizza! I enjoyed sitting at a table with a big flatscreen TV with football on. Everyone was so friendly, and the food was so amazing, that I will surely return. I hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"This place provides you with abundant options for your pie! It's practically the subway of pizzas with a far less corporate vibe. From crust, to cheese, sauce, and toppings, you aren't going to find this kind of selection at your run of the mill pizza parlor.
Being vegan, I was elated to see a vegan cheese option and went for it! There is also meat-free chicken and sausage but I think I'll experiment with those some other time.
Also, in my experience, the staff was very friendly, the store was clean and stocked, and they had ample seating for guests wanting to dine in. A+"}
{"text":"Nice little pizza gem. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Create your own unlimited pizza for only $8! It's a nice medium size that two people can easily share, even 3. Same concept as Pieology and tastes somewhat similar. My advice is to get half red sauce and half pesto. The pesto tastes soooo good! Not a perfect 5 stars because their chicken tasted funky- that fatty chewy kind and they ran out of mushrooms. The sweet siracha chicken is a must try. Unlimitied toppings and different cheeses and veggies make it a great value. They also have gluten free options. Its clean inside with nice tables, and a big tv in the back. Reminded me of Round Table, but better than Pizza Hut and those popular pizza chains."}
{"text":"DIY pizza spots are everywhere these days- this one offers the best portions, prices, quality, and customization options,  making it easy to eat with your Vegan and gluten-free friends too.  If you're not in the mood for pizza (you must be a freak of nature), they have a DIY salad option instead.  

Pick  your own crust, sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies, and your creation will be out in three minutes flat, for $8 (+reasonable upcharges for certain specialty options like goat cheese, prosciutto, etc). Staff are friendly and I like how the decor is modern and casual without a corporate feel. Grab a scoop of gelato for dessert if you're still hungry afterward.

The reason this spot gets an extra star than average for me is the quality toppings- they have everything from arugula and avocado to roasted red peppers, artichoke, and fresh cilantro and basil. Even better: the staff don't skimp on the toppings, everything is evenly applied. 

NOTE: The wheat crust is thicker than most \"thin\" crusts and after cooking is still a touch soft and chewy instead of crispy- I like it, but realize it's not what others are expecting. Each pizza is enough for two to share, or get one each and take leftovers for the next day's lunch."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. We've been wanting to try for awhile and finally had a chance. The staff is friendly and explained the ordering process. Our family of three ordered our own pizzas and each got what we wanted. They have a wide variety of toppings and they are generous with their portions too. The pizzas cook quickly and they bring it to your table. It taste great and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I thought I give them a try and woah I'm glad I did! Delish and great customer service, they take the time to explain all the different sauces what's in them they give you an option of the type of dough you would like to have and they also have a gluten free crust, plus a lot of toppings and meats to choose from! They have artichokes!!! Yes!!"}
{"text":"Love this place inside and out. Food is always good. Great gluten- free crust and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place because I can make it anyway I like and it's so fast and everybody is fired up and motivated if you have never been here you know to stop what your doing and go there for lunch.... Save me a slice"}
{"text":"Love this place, alaways made to YOUR liking! If you want more olives, you get more olives! lol u don't have to ask twice like other places!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is good as well. 
It's a basic pizza place just like pieology but a little different . It's was rally tasty ."}
{"text":"No dough. Seriously. they could not open for business on March 10, 2018 because they literally did not have dough.  I wish I could rate ZERO stars for having ZERO dough. Fail."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, inexpensive, delicious and hot. Super friendly helpful staff. Restaurant was very clean which is a must for me.  Picky kids loved it. The young people working were efficient and took pride in their jobs.  We will be back again. I am glad we took a chance and tried a new place. We have a new favorite Friday night pizza spot."}
{"text":"3 stars because the pizza is fantastic but the customer service is a bit subpar. Last 2 times we've been in, the place was empty and the workers made it seem like we were inconveniencing them by walking in. We go in the afternoon if that makes a difference in employee moral. They kind of threw the toppings on our pizza. Was strange. I'd hope they to remain open but I never see a manager there and the place has always been empty when we walk in.  Food and gelato are very good though. Stars for the food."}
{"text":"This is so good! And they have a kids size which Blaze(my favorite) does not have. Its also very filling I had 2 slices and that was good for me. I'd say it's comparable to blaze pizza rev etc. But bring a sweater because its cold in there. My first experience with this place was lack luster, I came in about 45/50 minutes before closing maybe 3 weeks ago and the young lady working wasn't exactly pleasant I skipped getting pizza here that evening all together. She didn't welcome us and just stood there taking the toppings out of their inserts. We asked if they were closing and she said \"no\". Didn't offer to get anything started just a no. The gentlemen this evening were slightly better but still not a blaze welcome!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: custom built 12 inch pizza, unlimited toppings for $7.99 with some flavorful toppings (Love the grilled zucchini) -  vegan and gluten free crust available for extra charge(3.5) service is good with counter service (3) value: not bad for a custom built pizza joint (3.5).

With all the custom built with unlimited toppings popping up here in the valley,  Pizza Kitchen is a welcome addition. 

I liked their toppings of house cheese blend, grilled zucchini (loved this), arugula, fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes and meatballs. The ham, sausage and ricotta didn't quite do it for me though. Their red sauce had a nice acidity to it which I enjoyed. 

FYI - For those that like spice, they do have Sriracha flavored meats (ie,  chicken and I think sausage? ) which do not have at the other custom built places. 

The whole wheat crust was quite nice -  more doughy than the usual thinner cracker crust. Loved how the edges are hand pulled at the end to give it a nicer crust. 

The pizza is baked on a conveyor belt vs. wood-fired. The benefit is you get a more consistent crust. But the down side is you miss the smokiness of a wood-fired product. 

I also noticed that they now offer custom build salads for $7.99 now which I think I try next time I drop by.

This place does a pretty good custom built pizza and does offer some toppings that others do not have. The crust is different enough to distinguish it from its competitors. Staff is friendly and helpful. Overall, a pretty good pizza for the price. 3.5 star review."}
{"text":"BIG Mahalo goes too my cousin Lori I for finding this place on Yelp. She has a gluten and dairy allergy so had few places bookmarked on her list wanted check out while visiting from the 808. Couple others ones but this was not only great find but even better less then ten minutes from my house. No doubt if in the personnel make your own pizza mood The Pizza Kitchen is my go spot hands down. I know your thinking there are SO many more options come to the whole build your own pie. It crazy thinking over the past few years the growth. Not just one side of town plus have all these chains coming from California, etc. Current could say Pieology or Blaze is the biggest names?? I never had Blaze (yet) but have had PIeology. Still fan of Pieology. Really lets be honest not much difference between any of these places but the details and the interior. 

Details Pieology not sure if they have unlimited toppings like The Pizza Kitchen. It can be misleading cause certain topping or say if get gluten free sought up charge of dollar. Certain toppings or extra that if not looking your pie can be over ten dollars. But for the basic The Pizza Kitchen think better deal then Pieology. The toppings for most part have the same options although green zucchini nice big slices at The Pizza Kitchen not recall if Pieology has it. The traditional the dough at The Pizza Kitchen really enjoy. It has nice golden crust everything cooked even and nothing burnt about the pie. They have few speciality pizza if not in mood come up with one. I did try the white clam pizza. Ok. My only problem was feel like could have put more clams on it. Outside of that the white sauce was really nice and perfect compliment with the clams and other stuff on top. My own my first visit keep it simple went with traditional, house blend cheese, pepperoni, sausage, artichoke, and pinch of jalapeño. Awesome. The second visit wanted try the pesto sauce so went with chicken and artichoke style pie with the pesto sauce. The pesto sauce is solid. I could have that sauce with basic pasta dish and be in pesto bliss. All the pies cook really fast so not much of wait. Nice and hot. The possibilities are endless. The dough have traditional, whole wheat, or gluten free. The base sauce, cheeses, protein, and toppings so many options it was hard make up one mind. So am sure they have some option for everyone and the only limit is ones imagination. Pieology they have whole Gelato section although both visit had no room after my pizza. Next time.

The service is five stars. The first trip mini Ohana reunion with bunch of cousins hardly see plus my own family my brother and his family. We were all first timers they were really patience explained the whole concept and nothing but smiles. Friendly. Once pie done they bring it out and again same positive vibes. 

The only thing that negative is location could be better around it. I have been living in the same area for years. I had no idea. The front of it looks nothing like the interior one that they did really nice good. Few different artwork all around the restaurant. Great place chill with family or whoever have great pie relax and talk stories. If looking for quick tasty pizza..The Pizza Kitchen is winnah. Literally went back two days later cause wanted try more and the best part is you never really have same pizza back-back."}
{"text":"The one thing our family of three enjoyed more than the super friendly staff killing us with their laughter and smiles (loved it!), was the pizza itself. 

We ordered three custom made 12\" pizza pies. We had a choice of pizza breads (very yummy), super fresh toppings galore, and -all very, very reasonably priced @ $7.99 each.

Within minutes of sitting down, our three 12\" custom built pizzas were being delivered to our table- not like any other pizza experience we've ever had. 

Our family says this place deserves 5 sumptuous stars and then some! 

We will be posting pictures of two of our pies; the other one disappeared like a magician's trick down our hungry teenager's throat."}
{"text":"5 stars

What started out as a disappointing afternoon was quickly brightened by this place. After getting dropped off at a pizza shop that ended up being closed during business hours, we walk about a mile down the road to this pizza place instead. I am glad that we did. Highlights: friendly staff, fresh ingredients 

Service: 5/5
The service was top notch here. They explained everything and seemed to genuinely was you to be excited and pleased with your meal. 

Cleanliness: 5/5
On my visit, it was very clean.

Food: 5/5
I love the build your own personal pizza trend. You get exactly what you want without have to consult with everyone else. What really stood out was the sheer variety of choices for a pizza-- fig preserve, kale pesto, a slew of vegan friendly options, pulled pork, etc. Plus, everything was very fresh!

Environment: 5/5
Pop country was playing in the background very softly. I love how bright it was in there. It just feels alive. 

It was love at first bite. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I walked in expecting it to be like the other custom pizza places in town, but it was more like Subway. The ingredients are right in front of you, and you get to choose your type of crust, sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies. There were vegan/vegetarian options to choose from as well. The wait was very short and the workers were helpful in answering any questions. The pizza I ordered was enough to satisfy me and a friend. Very affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friends because one of my friend is vegan and we wanted to find out a place we all can enjoy food and she wanted to try this place. Plus who can say no to pizza right? So we ordered traditional with vegan tomato sauce, vegan cheese, onions, mushrooms, green pepper, one side banana peppers and vegan chicken. We also asked for basil and sun-dried tomatoes and the girl said she will put the basil after they took out the pizza but guess she for got to add both of them toppings. Either way the pizza way yummy! I'm not vegan and if this is how vegan pizza taste like I would definitely go vegan and stay on pizza forever! I love how the vegan cheese and chicken tasted! It was gooey but super good and vegan chicken tasted better than actual chicken."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with very low expectation and came out very satisfied with the food.

I ordered BBQ Chicken Pizza with Wheat Crust. I added peppers , Spinach, Garlic Olive Coating, Onions, Chicken, Cilantro.
We can add as many toppings as we like. 

Pizza Taste is awesome. For $8 12 inch Pizza can be easily shared by two people, Thus saving on lunch $'s while eating yummy Pizza.

Recommend trying this place out if you live around 89148 Zipcode."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Since I moved to the southwest from nyc it's literally been a pizza desert out here. The pizza I had today was phenomenal, completely blew my mind and I'll never order from anywhere else again. The Hawaiian pizza was outstanding. The wings are perfect. I can't wait to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks! When going to eat our first slice all the toppings slid off and greasy! Sun dried tomatoes should be cooked on the pizza and not served cold on the side. Pizza crust is very dough and should be cooked longer. I was so hoping for this place to be good because pieology is my absolute favorite in downtown summerlin but I hate waiting 30 minutes in line but there pizza is bomb and well worth the wait!  Pieology is also cooked in a wood fire oven, don't waste your dont with this place just take a short drive to pieology."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite smaller pizza places in Las Vegas. It's fast, fresh, and great tasting. You get in and you get to custom make your pizza from the sauce to the toppings you like. It honestly takes only about 5 minutes to cook so you can get it even if you're in a hurry. 
The only reason I knocked a star off is because they had a very small selection of ice cream at the time I went and I would have liked to be able to try some."}
{"text":"Good pizza, ordered pineapple, but got onion instead. Kind of ruined the point of a Hawaiian pizza, but other than that, the delivery was fast, decent tasting pizza for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Wow so this place totally blew my expectations away. First off they don't skimp you on the cheese like the larger chains do (aka Pie 5). Gentleman was super friendly helping you and they have goat cheese...if you never had that on a pizza...wow super flavorful especially with tri-olives.  I could not even finish my portion for a decent price."}
{"text":"So yummy such a good idea. Employees are all very nice and make GREAT suggestions! Restaurant / decor is very clean and simple haven't tried anything except the pizza but will go back again to try the wins and gelato!!!"}
{"text":"Easy and straight forward ordering process, great prices (I always love a place that shows support to the troops), and great service. I didn't catch the guy's name (long haired young guy) but he was very thorough after I told him it was my first visit. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I'm literally sitting down here having my pizza right now with my kids, and I must say that this is the most delicious and flavorful pizza I have ever had. 

I was literally at the red light on Fort Apache and hacienda when I spotted this place and decided to give them a try. I am so happy I decided to come here. There is plenty of parking outside and when you walk in there's plenty of seating also.

I ordered me a veggie Pizza with vegan cheese and spicy marinara sauce. The fact that they have Vegan options that actually taste great is a big deal for me as I am trying to transition into a more plant based lifestyle. My kids had a regular cheese pizza. 

There are so many options of toppings to choose from. They literally have everything you can think of to put on your pizza. The place is nice, clean, neat, airy, and the customer service was great. Will definitely be returning back here pronto with my family. If you're looking for fast service, great food and a cool space to sit down and eat, then come and give this place a try. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Another great pizza find that has mastered the Art of the Build Your Own....with a little guidance from myself of course.  The Pizza Kitchen is located in the Southwest at Hacienda and Ft. Apache.  This concept is my favorite since you can pick between traditional, whole wheat and gluten free crust.  Also, they have several choices of cheese like mozzarella, house blend and feta to name a few.  Meat choices are a plenty and so are the veggies.  For one price of $7.99 you can pick as many or as little as you like to make your piece of pizza bliss.  

The Pizza cooks in a conveyor style oven and your creation comes out in about 3 minutes.  We had couple of pies  the other afternoon and they were delicious.  This was our first experience and it was a positive one.  The girl behind the counter started out with a little attitude because we made a small mistake in crust choice, but she softened up after a while.  I let her slide and still gave them 5 stars on food and quality.  Pizza Kitchen also has Gelato and build your own salads available if you wish.  

I recommend stopping by Pizza Kitchen asap and several times a week if you are in the Southwest part of Las Vegas.  This place is worth the trip and I hope they survive.  They are a small operation with this being there only location.  Support small business when possible. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer since DAY ONE! I was there on the first day they opened the doors and I have not ordered pizza at any other restaurant since. This place is amazing. 

Food: $8.65 for pizza after taxes is incredible. Any topping and the pizza can easily last 2 meals for one or feed 2 people. I am a large guy and I order one pizza for lunch and eat it at lunch and dinner. The ingredients are far superior to other custom pizza places. It's a fast food pizza place so don't expect Chicago or New York pizza, but expect great quality for what you pay. 

Service: I have NEVER had bad service here. I spoke with the owner the first week and I am very happy spending money to help support the business. The staff is always friendly and always creates an great pizza. 

Thank you Pizza Kitchen. I will be a customer as long as I live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch spot. The pizza is cheap and you get to make it anyway you want with an unlimited amount it topping. There are a few that are an up charge but not many. The staff is friendly and the pizzas come out perfect and ready to eat."}
{"text":"We love the \"build your own pizza\" concept, and couldn't believe we hadn't tried this place yet.  12\" pizzas are $8.50 with sauce, cheese, and four toppings.  Not unlimited, sure, but very generous portions of toppings.  Basil and kale pesto options.   Regular crust is delicious- blows the crust from PizzaRev away!  And toppings were carefully spread to make sure they were evenly distributed- I had artichoke in almost every bite!  The new owner took over early February 2018, and looks to be on track to be successful.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Pieology since a staff member was rude to me and I've been hoping for another \"build your own\" pizza place on our side of town. Ever since Custom Built closed last summer, there has been an empty spot in the southwest but not anymore!
The Pizza Kitchen fills the void!
Staff is very friendly, especially Samantha. I did not get the young man's name who also helped us but he was very courteous and patient. He told me he believed The Pizza Kitchen to be better than Pieology and he is correct!
The Pizza Kitchen has a nice, foldable crust with good chew and good flavor. I found their red sauce to be rather flavorful. I opted for shredded mozzarella and ricotta cheese on mine whereas my husband had the \"house blend\" cheese (White cheddar, mozzarella and provolone). Toppings were a bit skimpy but staff didn't hesitate to add a little more when politely asked to do so. I had half Sriracha chicken, half pepperoni and pineapple, my husband had a whole pepperoni and ham.
Prices are $7.99 for unlimited toppings, fountain drinks, $1.99. The register swivels out to the guest for the guest to add a tip to the bill. A little odd to add a tip before one has tasted the food but we based our tip purely on the service from the awesome staff!
If we had one complaint, it would be that the music was a bit too loud for an early afternoon lunch but that is just our opinion.
We were both pleased with the food and will be regulars at The Pizza Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a novel idea! You customize your pizza as you move down the line. Your pizza is cooked in 2 1/2 minutes & brought to your table! They have GLUTEN FREE pies & Soy Cheese! Love that about this place, I'm always looking for a \"healthy pizza\" when I have that craving! The kale sauce is very flavorful, reminded of a pesto sauce."}
{"text":"Customer service is awesome, I didn't feel rushed. He recommended new sauces to my worker instead of the traditional red sauce. Pizza was awesome piping hottest, cheese was on point, crust was to die for! Price was even better, I will definitely will be back, I definitely will spread the word to others!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place yesterday after forever contemplating trying it! Hubby and I split a pizza. His side was pepperoni; my side had sausage, mushrooms, olives, red onion, basil,and  red peppers! I was actually surprised at how much I liked it! We previously tried a different make your own pizza place and were disappointed! The ONLY thing I didn't like was the dough was too soft. There was a lady dining it while I was waiting on my pizza to cook who brought her pizza back and I didn't hear what she said, but I'm assuming her dough was undercooked as well because she had ran her pizza back through a couple times. Wish I would have asked her to run mine through again cause that killed it a little bit for me. Other than that, I liked it :) Only $8 and some change too!"}
{"text":"TPK is the new pizza place to be at. Despite the lack of originality and potential confusion with the name (California Pizza Kitchen, anyone?), this place is my favorite custom built pizza place in Vegas so far... RIP Custom Built Pizza :( 

Cons: I'm so short, sometimes its hard for the workers to hear me over the glass. If the worker is also short, we have a hard time hearing each other lol

Aside from that, it's all pros for me. Their workers always have upbeat or very eager to help attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. The quality of their toppings is much more consistent and flavorful than Pieology. I never have to ask \"can you please put some more of (topping)?\" because they give a generous amount of everything you ask for. I love ordering the traditional crust with both house blend cheese and ricotta, then I'll add pepperoni, regular sausage, spicy sriracha sausage, bacon, mushrooms, roasted garlic and capers. They really won me over with the capers. I'm sure most people get the capers for their make-your-own salads, but I love capers as an anchovies or olives salty-substitute. Seating is plentiful inside, so it would be a great place to take kids post-sports practices or games. I usually come here when I don't know what I want to eat for lunch, too lazy to make dinner or just need some comfort food."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here today and we both enjoyed our pizza with unlimited toppings. We decided next time we go we will share a pizza since we both ended up taking 1/2 of it home.

I got 1/2 pesto and 1/2 white sauce, blended cheese which consisted of mozzarella, white cheddar and parmasean. I also added ricotta cheese (yum!),  meatballs, spicy sausage, roasted garlic, spinach and roasted red pepper. 

Mom ordered the same sauce and cheese. She added chicken, bacon, pepperoni, roasted garlic and mushrooms. 

The establishment was clean and the staff was very friendly and attentive to us when we walked in. 

We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great! So many options and toppings for one low price. I've been here around 5 times and the service has always been good, too."}
{"text":"They are so much better at making pizzas than I am at taking pictures. It's one of those unlimited toppings, have it your way #pizza places. Choice of four cheeses, three crusts, six (?) sauces, 50 toppings including vegan ones on a 12\" pizza for $7.99 pre tax. Mine was a half #sausage #bacon #mushroom with #redsauce and half #chicken #bacon #spinach with #whitesauce It was delicious and it was lunch time and I turned the TV to SpongeBob cuz somehow there was no one in there at noon #nationalpizzaday"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT !!!!! Fantastic friendly service and the pizza was\" DELICIOUS \". Bye Bye Dominos."}
{"text":"Bad pizza, hot wings were decent, but the service here is garbage. The kid who seems like he runs the place is a terrible rep for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved it! I'm that crazy person who puts EVERYTHING on a pizza. You get a great deal for what you're actually paying. The staff was awesome. They were helpful, professional, and friendly--not something you find very often anymore. We sampled the gelato and ended up getting the Espresso and Pistachio. The decision was difficult because all the ones we sampled were delicious. I would choose dining here again instead of ordering from most delivery places."}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza and the price point is perfect for all the options offered. My biggest thumbs up about this place is that you are able to create whatever pizza pie you want. My little guys loved their half cheese and half nitrate free pepperoni pizza. This mom absolutely loved their kale pesto sauce. On our next visit we will save room for their gelato ice cream. The service was quick, friendly, and efficient. Will we definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't  Go here, Go to Pieology!!! I have been here before, but never have I got a burnt pizza. Unbelievable that they would even serve it. Burnt crust and veggies! The manager was not even willing to replace it, said that's how all the Gluten-free pizza 's look. Which I know the last time I was there my pizza with gluten-free crust (as I have a gluten allergy) was not burnt or I wouldn't have came back if they could not get it right! Why pay extra for gluten-free burnt pizza, not worth my money!!! The most appalling thing was the lack of concern with serving burnt pizza, and acting like something was wrong with me! Whole new staff, I'm never going back! ! ! Hopefully, the owner gets a clue. I spoke to her on the phone and she didn't even apologize,  but did tell the manager to make another pizza. I let them make it and I walked out without it, I was not sure what they did to the crust when he went in the back to get it and took a little while. 
Unsatisfied customer!!!"}
{"text":"If you've been to Pieology, then you'll know the drill for The Pizza Kitchen: create your own personal pizza from the bottom up with the crust, to the sauce, to unlimited toppings all for an extremely reasonable set price. 

That's where the similarities end with Pieology. The difference is exactly why I liked it better. The Pizza Kitchen is just on another level. When they were making my pizza, they didn't skimp on the toppings like Pieology does. They didn't give me a hard time when I asked for more of the toppings like that \"other place\" did. When my pie came out with all the fixings, the crust wasn't burned like it frequently is at that \"other place\". Their pizza didn't get cold outside of 5 minutes like that other place's paper-thin pizza does, nor did it leave me still feeling hungry like the \"other place\" did. 

Simply put, the pizza that I ordered was delicious and left me full and satisfied. The crust wasn't too thin and was perfect. No burned edges. All of the veggie toppings that I chose were fresh and the sauce was flavorful. The cheese wasn't stringy at all and actually stayed on the slice, unlike that other place's pizza. Best of all, my pie didn't get cold before I finished eating it, like the pizzas at that place in Summerlin are prone to do. 

Last but not least is the quality of service. In a word: tremendous. The girl who took my order was extremely friendly and helpful. Kudos to management for hiring a staff that seems as if they truly want to make you a pizza that you'll enjoy. 

Great food, great service, and all for a great price. I can't recommend this place enough. I'll be a frequent and loyal visitor to The Pizza Kitchen and am so glad that it's closer to me than that \"other place\"."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch around 2:30. I love this place and the idea behind it! You start by choosing your type of crust, then you pick a sauce, or even two. Which I absolutely loved! The thing I have always hated about ordering pizza is that if I want a BBQ chicken pizza and a regular pizza, I have to get two separate pizzas, but not here.  Then you add the cheeses, meats, and veggies to your likings. Which is so awesome for the picky and specific eaters AKA, me. (: The food was great, aside from the chicken breast, which I feel could have better taste, but it wasn't worth taking a star away because the spicy chicken and service makes up for it. 

So the service was great, I wish I could remember the guy's name who helped us, he was tall, dark, and on the thin side, but his guest service outshines everyone he was working with by far. 

This place is very decently priced, $30 for 3 pizzas and 2 drinks. 

So glad this is close to home!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night. I have been a fan of custom made pizzas and I had pretty good experiences with similar places (Pielogy, Project Pie). 

Their menu has a vast variety of options. You can choose from regular crust to whole wheat or gluten-free. You can either choose to build-your-own pizzas or you can choose from their special menu that offers ingredients that are not made available for the build your own. They had interesting choices like clams, goat cheese, Hawaiian, etc. 

I went for one of their specials: the Fig & Prosciutto with goat cheese, arugula on whole wheat while my boyfriend had his custom built. Both pizzas tasted amazing! The fig preserve on my pizza was sweet and tangy but it was perfectly balanced out by the saltiness of the cheese and meat. Also, since I did not have much sauce on mine, the crust came out super crispy! The custom pizza had a lot of ingredients in it so the crust was not as crisp but still the flavor was excellent. I guess in cases of thin crust pizzas, less is more. 

I would definitely recommend this place. If you're in the mood for custom made pizzas but don't want to drive to the strip or Summerlin, you have to try it out. Plus, Halloween City just opened up right next to them."}
{"text":"We came here a lot when it opened because it was fresh and the people were friendly. Over the last few months the service has really slid downhill, so much so that the workers were all in the back on their phones while our pizza stayed on the track and burned. We had to finally go up and ask if it was done. Then the worker argued with us that it wasn't burned. 

Nice that they remade it - not so nice that customer service is not a priority.  Could be why the place is empty during lunch time. Barely hanging on to two stars because the pizza is good once you do get it and it's not burned."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Better quality and selection than all competitors. It also doesn't mess around with the BS pricing structure pizza places are using."}
{"text":"I cannot stop raving about this place! The Pizza Kitchen is probably one of my most favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. I enjoy having the ability to customize my pizza however I want, with whatever toppings I want. 

The pizza only takes about three minutes in the oven and you have the option to eat it there or take it out; I usually do both. I appreciate the decor of the restaurant, the amount of seating available, in addition to how clean it is. 

My most favorite part of going to The Pizza Kitchen is the amazing guest service. Everyone who works there is incredibly kind (especially Jon), and I leave there happier than I came. 

I highly recommend checking this place out! (:"}
{"text":"Good service and good prices make this joint a must visit. I suggest the wheat crust with spicy marinara, feta, and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Took time to explain all the options available. My husband went with the Meat pizza. I had a chicken, artichoke, kalamata olive and sun dried tomato pizza with pesto sauce. It took more like 5 minutes, rather than 3, but no biggie. My only complaint is they don't serve iced tea."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza Place.

Make your own, choose your toppings. I got BBQ Sauce, Mozerlla Cheese and Ricotta.  Sriracha Chicken and  Bacon.  Mushrooms, onion, roasted peppers, and black olives.

Pizza was amazing!  YASS!  This place is brand new and fills a void where we were missing the build your own pizza shipse.

Place was new and clean. The employees here are helpful, friendly, and professional.

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We used to go to Pieology when we lived in Northern CA.  Noticed that I said used to, but after walking into The Pizza Kitchen, we don't go anywhere else for pizza anymore. Shane is a pizza artist extraordinaire and the team that works there is top notch from greeting with a smile to thanking you for coming as you leave.  Great job!!  Please give this amazing pizza smorgasbord a chance.  You get to create any type of pizza you can imagine and they even offer both whole wheat and gluten free crust options.  Pizzas are ready in3 minutes - what are you waiting for - this is a great idea for Super Bowl Pizzas"}
{"text":"When When I can come here and me my wife and nephew all leave happy with pizza that we like!!! WE'RE IN LOVE. 
service is fast, great customer service and tasty food! 
On my side of town this is THE BEST pizza joint."}
{"text":"I am going to make this real simple for you.....if you Like Pizza......and your VEGAN......there is no other place in Las Vegas to visit. The Pizza Kitchen offers VEGAN options like Vegan Chicken.....Vegan Cheese.....Gluten Free Crust.....Olive Oil.....and Garlic Herb Sauces to satisfy all of your Vegan Desires. Yes there is Pizza for those NON Vegans but who cares about them right......LOL? My suggestion: Traditional Crust.....Olive Oil....BBQ Sauce.....Garlic.....Vegan Chicken.....Vegan Cheese.....Roasted Red Peppers.....Green Peppers.....Mushrooms.....and Plenty of Napkins.....LOL!!!!! Enough Said......Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun and family friendly!  So many options for creations and so delicious!!   Can't wait for our next visit!!  Under great new ownership!"}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings for only $7.99 + open daily from 11am-9pm! Service is great and food is fresh. You walk into a clean restaurant and greeted by happy employees. This is a locally owned pizza store so you can basically do anything to your pizza that you desire! They will soon be selling salads and gelato! Great and wonderful place for casual dining, family get togethers, and so much more! Try it out yourself for a one of a kind experience. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. The ingredients are always fresh, the restaurant is always clean, and I have never had to wait in a line. No, it is not THE best pizza you'll ever have. But, it's an excellent pizza with every ingredient you can imagine. It highly compares to Blaze Pizza if you've ever had that."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza, & I love that you can choose several toppings without an extra charge! Good customer service, you're pizza gets cooked right away"}
{"text":"Everyone in my family loved your pizza!!!!
I ordered a wheat crust, goat cheese. Very healthy and taste great!!!!"}
{"text":"Just passing through and wife saw this place, it's one size pizza for $7.99 with unlimited toppings.. Delicious. The place is nice and clean with very helpful crew. Too bad we dont live close to this place otherwise sayonara Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza spot in Las Vegas they make delicious personalized pizza and they rock for having both vegan cheese and vegan chicken!"}
{"text":"This new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley.  For only $7.99, you can custom build your own pizza.  There are three different crusts to choose from - traditional, wheat and gluten free. Quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that I would have to try next time.  They have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  What I really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  Once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  It doesn't have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but I like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. Their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.  

I ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce.  Then I loaded it with house blend cheese, Italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  They actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesn't get all crispy and all dried up. It was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  The crust wasn't all dried up.  But when I got the pizza home it wasn't very hot at all.  It was actually only lukewarm.  I don't know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  Maybe next time I would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.

I would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  I was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  But bonus for me, because I did not have to wait in any line."}
{"text":"What a great place! I will absolutely come back here soon! Service dogs welcome no questions asked which is so nice to see businesses following federal law. My coworker and I shared a pizza. This place reminds me of subway for pizzas. They allow you pick your cheese, meats and toppings. Great atmosphere. Fresh food! Employees where helpful and had great customer service. Will be coming back soon, thank you!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for lunch delivery through BiteSquad. The delivery was set for an hour after the order was placed. 70 minutes later I messaged BiteSquad to check on the delivery eta. They informed me they hadn't been able to reach the restaurant via phone or online since we placed the order. I don't know if they are closed on Fridays or just don't answer the phone. They wasted our lunch break and cost themselves some customers."}
{"text":"I'm not one to post often but I had no choice after coming to the pizza kitchen. Food and price point are amazing! I would highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I always give this place 5 stars but after this one particular night it deserves 3, merely based on customer service(or lack of rather). Went in around 6, which didn't seem late until all 5 workers acted as if I was such an inconvenience. I ordered 4 pizzas to go and while picking my toppings and trying to liven up the mood I got nothing but dry replies and unamused glances. I come here often being as its only 2 mins from me, and I always get amazing service....with that, I will return with high hopes that that was one bad night for the adolescents working. Please don't let me down again pizza kitchen"}
{"text":"Super clean...lots of pizza topping choices too! We asked for extra crispy to cook 30 seconds longer...yummy! We got the olive oil with fresh garlic, no sauce, then house cheese, pepperoni, black olives, Italian sausage and sun dried tomatoes...perfecto! 2 pops and pizza was $12"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great friendly service and quick amazing pizza! I go here on my 40 min lunch breaks all the time with more time to spare. LOVE that you can dec out your pizza to whatever you want on it for $8!! Can't go wrong. Their inside decor is very neat and modern too! Check this place out :)"}
{"text":"The kids and I spent our family dinner night at The Pizza Kitchen tonight, and I've gotta say the pizza was amazing! The Pizza Kitchen is a build your own pizza restaurant in a family friendly and trendy atmosphere. The dough is fantastic! The toppings are fresh, and the sauce is flavorful. The service was quick and the staff friendly. 

Everyone LOVED it and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Great food and superb service. What more can you ask for! If you haven't tried it yet you must! I will most definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"The Pizza Kitchen is set up like Subway or Chipotle. You walk down the line and choose your own sauce, cheese, meats and veggies and create your pizza exactly how you'd like to. The service is quick  mostly because of the efficiency of the food line. 

The pizza is suitable for vegans, and is absolutely delicious. I loaded mine up with almost every veggie they had. It's extremely affordable and tasty."}
{"text":"I. Cannot. Even. Deal. 

This pizza place is my new fave in the neighborhood! 

Lemme start with the good. The really REALLY good. 

UNLIMITED TOPPINGS!!!!!!! 
Crust - traditional, wheat, and gluten free. (All thin crust)
Meats - chicken, shiracha chicken, shiracha sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, Italian sausage, etc. 
Sauces - red sauce, white sauce, garlic spread, pesto, etc. 
Cheese - house blend, feta, blue, ricotta, VEGAN CHEESE, too! 
Veggies - Garlic. Roasted garlic. Zucchini. Tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes. Mushrooms. Banana peppers. Capers. Pineapples. Avocado. Spinach. Olives. Etc. ETC. 

Once it's popped in the \"oven\" it has a not so crusty (baked) crust, which I like a lot. Especially since I'm not big in thin crust pizza. I, actually, finished my crust on these bad boys! 

Co$t = Cheap! 2 custom pizza for $15! 


Now. The bad. 
The wait. This place is, literally, the \"Subway of pizzas.\" You choose all your toppings as you walk the line. 
After I ordered my pizza, my boyfriend didn't have a chance to make his order til the 3 ladies after us (in line) made theirs. There was a miscommunication on who helps who in the line. 
I guess the employee helping me had to make my BF's pizza versus my BF being next in line. But, the employee helping me wasn't able to start til he was done with mines. 
Which makes sense. 
But I can see a back log of clients waiting. 
Maybe if they had one person in each station the wait time wouldn't be as bad --- someone in charge of dough and cheese, another in meats, and last in doing veggies. 
Kinda like how Subways does it. 

Either way, this place is new and has a great chance in getting better. Especially in he service/timing of everything."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pick up on 12/30/2016.

I ordered online around 3:55pm, my order was not ready until 4:30. Online time for it to be ready was at 4:15. Also, they did not bother calling me to tell me that one of my orders was not available. Common courtesy is to let your customer know something is not available and to ask if there's something else we would like. But no, none of that. The worker said we'll get refunded by the company they work with online. Hopefully I see that in 2-3 day, if not I paid $10 for nothing. 

We also ordered the wings and on special instructions we wrote if they can put the sauce on the side because we have kids that will be eating it. (We ordered mango habenero). They didn't put it on the side; what's the point of having special instructions if you don't look it over. At least let your customer know it can't be done then we can ask for something else. Communication is key.  

The pizza was really good, my family liked it and the kids liked it. It's sad that people who work for a good place don't care about it. Three workers and one could of easily made our experience much better. 

We ordered four pizzas (one cancelled by the pizza kitchen) and an order of wings came out to $42 it was pricey, but wanted to give it a try.

If we go here again we'll have to go in person to make sure things are available. 

Very good pizza, but not the service."}
{"text":"This place is in the shopping center next to where i live, and had a craving for pizza but every where i look they are so expensive for a small pizza so i decide to try this place and soooooo glad that i did the pizza was so good and the plus that i could put what i wanted on it was so cool and not get charged more is even better."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first. I really only wanted a slice of pizza, but here you have to order the whole pizza. Once she told me I could have white sauce, mushrooms, capers, zucchini, artichokes, and garlic on my pizza I was in. This place is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Pizza Kitchen! We each get our own pizza with unlimited toppings for about $8 and there is plenty for leftovers.

It has never been too busy when we go in and we always feel welcomed by the incredible staff.

Go visit the Pizza Kitchen!"}
{"text":"This is real pizza. The secret to the great flavor is that the crust is cooked with an impinger oven. (Hot air). No burned crust edges. 

The toppings are fresh the staff is helpful and energetic. The quality of toppings and cheese are good. The process is quick. The dining room is clean. It is an easy fast quality meal. Plenty of space for the whole gang."}
{"text":"Best Pizza for the price you will ever have and u get it in 3min  !!! BOOM Fresh veggies ...Awesome Staff !!! As far as the price changes.... you still won't find a cheaper price for the quality. Some people out there want everything for free . I'll be a regular  !!"}
{"text":"Very neat spot. Immediately greeting as I walk in the door and all the staff very friendly and helpful. Pizza delicious and for unlimited toppings, options of crust and plus homemade gelato you honestly can't beat that price. Glad I decided to stop by for a bite!"}
{"text":"I had the very nice lady who works here just make a pizza that she likes and it turned out amazing and she was so sweet. It is cheap too. 8 bucks for a nice sized pizza, can't beat it"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for lunch once a week since they opened a little over a month ago. As a group of coworkers it is often hard to decide and agree on where we want to eat everyday but we all have no problems agreeing on coming here at least once every week. I love the custom pizza choices and after going for over a month we ran into the owner a very wonderful lady who spent quite a bit of time formulating the right crusts with the right kind of oven for consistent quality and quick turn around for getting your food to the table. Although the pizza is amazing they now have custom salads you can build as well as gelato ice cream. The staff has always been very friendly and the decor is very clean and well done. I would not hesitate to come here and do so on the regular because they are doing it right."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and got great service but most importantly great food! Did I mention unlimited toppings!! Good job!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Unlimited toppings, anything you could think of! I'm in love! Friendly staff and very clean store. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best gluten free crust I've had. It's a struggle to find a gf crust that's not cardboard texture - this was moist, and almost fluffy. I think the kid making my pizza forgot the arugula, i didn't ask for that to be left off. Even without it the combo was fantastic! 
My husband did a traditional meat lovers and raved about it as well."}
{"text":"3 thumbs up for vegan options. The crust is perfect for smashing two while pizzas myself. I when I dream of pizza it's \"The Pizza Kitchen\". The staff is super friendly, knowledgable about the crust ingredients, patient with topping selections, and helpful with flavor combination recommendations. Pizza in 7 minutes is perfect for my go go go life and frequent point of starvation, by the time I can sit down to eat. Yummmmmmm x 17"}
{"text":"i ordered a plain or basic pizza. menu board says $7.50. I was charged $7.99. when i questioned it the employees said the computer says $7.99, and i guess they didn't change it on the board. I complained that if you advertise a price you should stand by it until you change it for the public. The answer is we don't make the changes.
At that point I would have expected them to give me back the overage that was charged but no. Not gonna happen.
Pizza was ok but attitude sucked!
Lost my business on attitude and I will tell anyone I know not to frequent there. 
Lost more than my business now!!!! That's my attitude...
And thanks to Mike S for posting. He was there with his family witnessing this incident!!!"}
{"text":"OMG.....I've tried all the pizza places in this area since I work on this side of town.  I'm so super impressed with this place! The guys were awesome and the pizza is AMAZING!! I ordered a traditional crust, with marinara sauce, extra mozzarella cheese and pepperoni!! It was ready in 3 min which was perfect so I can head back to work and finish my lunch hour! The only con I have is that since it was only $7 for any type of pizza with unlimited toppings....I will be having more pizza more often and my waistline will be upset with me! Great place for a great price and delicious pizza! The regular size gives me extra pizza to either take home for dinner or leave here at work for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious fresh vegan gluten free pizza with exceptional service and super speedy delivery. Literally have ordered from them twice in one day."}
{"text":"I love the pizza kitchen. I can't get enough of the unlimited toppings. I can put whatever I want on my pizza that is so awesome. But I can't forget the best manager there Pauline. She is always so helpful and she knows her stuff. She's friendly energetic. The best worker they have there. I like Selene also she's very polite and helpful. Those two totally rock and they will keep me coming back. Keep up the great job ladies"}
{"text":"First time here and I am very impressed. They are very clean and have so many choices. Regular crust and gluten free and they even have vegan meat toppings! The food was delicious and very reasonably priced! The service was great everyone is very friendly.  I will definitely be back! Yum pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating at the Pizza Kitchen. The environment inside feels hostile. A few days ago when an angry customer verbally harassed an employee, the management did not ask the loud and unnecessarily rude customer to leave, but instead comped the customer's food, insisting it was the employee's fault. I feel that this made for an unpleasant dining experience and that this establishment is very poorly managed. Not to mention, the pizza is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"My girlfriend recommended this place, but I was skeptical because I'm pretty picky. I tried it yesterday for the first time and liked it a lot. The service was quick and the pizza was yummy. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good pizza, friendly fast service, and I love the price and concept. The parking is convenient and it's easy to get in and out. I'll be telling all my friends to come here!"}
{"text":"This place blows away Pieology. They don't micro manage your toppings on the pizza! They are very generous with everything! The crust is thin but tasty and not flabby like Pieology! The pizza sauce is flavorful and fresh! Toppings are amazing and too many to choose from! You will walk out of here full and satisfied eating a quality pizza! Staff is very friendly and the place is above and beyond clean!!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"After driving past this place a couple of times, my bf and I decided to give it a try. Since the bf wasn't all that hungry, we shared a regular sized pizza which was more than enough. I had ordered the special pizza with clam, bacon with alfredo sauce and ohhhh man it sure was delicious! Great sized pizza for a decent price and it actually tastes good too? Hell yeah sign me up for some of that cause this place is A-OK!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to The Pizza Kitchen. 

The staff was friendly. Place is clean. And they burned my pizza... 

It was disappointing to find the bottom of my pizza was burned, which overpowered the other flavors, including the goat cheese I paid extra for. Couldn't finish it, ended up throwing it out. 

If I go back, next time I'll check the pizza before leaving."}
{"text":"I love this place. Speedy, friendly, generous. In fact, a few weeks ago, when my friend gave birth at Southern Hills Hospital, this is what she had me bring her. That's right...pizza so good, that birthing mothers are begging for it!!!!

Vegan toppings ... and they have options! They are often out of some of the vegan stuff, but hey, I'll take what I can get. The best thing about this place is they don't skimp (like Pizza Rev). I've never had to ask them to reapply a topping. They are already really generous. I love the thin crust on the regular dough as well. It's not overly filling. 

My only complaint is the gluten free dough. Bleh! It was so tough and hard, it was like eating rocks. I feel sorry for all you gluten-free people."}
{"text":"I came into this place thinking I should give it a 5-star review but things changed and not for the better. 

1st: Unlimited toppings are GONE - tell your friends so they won't come in disappointed the next time they show up

2nd: 4 toppings for $8.50 for the 12 inch pie and each additional one is .75 more

Staff went lighter than what I'm used to with the toppings so now my pizza looks pretty basic. So not only am I getting limited toppings with a price increase, they are more strict with putting toppings. 

Even just getting my normal items the pizza would've cost me $12 based on new prices (mostly veggies). TBH at that point it's just easier to go elsewhere.

The whole \"walk up and you pick the pizza you want to make your way with 1 price\" is gone and I'm pretty disappointed. 

Pizza is above average overall still but there is literally no reason to go inside there anymore when you can call in and just do basic orders since every other pizza place on the planet does the same thing .

Ya had a great thing and butchered it. Keep it simple guys, if you wanted to improve margins just change the price to 8.99 or 9 and change for unlimited toppings.  The one thing that made you unique is now gone.  

Am I salty? Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm the only one that won't be disappointed moving forward.

Edit: Initially have this a 4 star review because of how much love i used to have for this place. But as I  finished my pizza it dawned on me, this was a sad pizza and pizza is supposed to make me happy. I took off my rose colored glasses and moving it down to 3 stars (should be about 3.5 imo)."}
{"text":"Great place, under new management. Fantastic service, meals made quickly, and great food. Kids both had cheese pizzas, my husband had a bacon chicken ranch, and I had bbq chicken. Super yummy, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just had this place for the second time - it's delicious! Fresh ingredients and maybe 5 minutes of waiting time is absolutely worth it.  I'll choose this place over traditional delivery pizza any day"}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place to me and I'm glad they did! The exceptional customer service starts the minute you walk in and are greeted. You can select your own crust, sauce, cheeses, and toppings. . . Unlimited on a 10in crust for $7.99! It names pretty quickly and it tastes amazing. I have been back quite a few times and refer all my coworkers and friends to it. Can't wait to take my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"The Pizza Kitchen is located on the corner of Hacienda and S.Fort Apache. It is in the Walmart Plaza. Easy to find.

We arrived there around 6pm for dinner. We were the only people there for a few minutes and then a few more customers cam in. It was not that busy for a Wednesday night at dinner time. You stand in line while they prepare your pizza just like you were at a sandwich shop or a burrito spot. After you pick all of your toppings it goes in the oven and you go sit down. When the pizza is cooked a server brings it to your table.

$8.00 for unlimited toppings is great. They had plenty of fresh toppings to choose from. Unfortunately the were out of whole wheat dough. They lose one star for running out of product. The pizza crust was very thin, so it cooked quickly.

They also have vegan cheese, meats, and gluten free dough.

Overall the pizza was good, the service was good, and the place looked clean. If your in the area I would stop by and try this place."}
{"text":"Pizza Kitchen is now my go-to pizza spot! The best part about it is the fact that it caters to everyone--including those of us with specific dietary restrictions (GF, V, what have you!)

It's a pretty simple concept, you've got your choices of crust and unlimited toppings. If options scare you, they've got a few signature pizzas on the board. There are several ingredients that I love having on my pizza that are offered here and not at typical pizza joints: artichokes, sundried tomatoes, fresh basil, vegan cheese, and grilled zucchini. Mmm...

Anyway, the best part is that everyone gets to enjoy some delicious pizza together! They even offer different types of crust. Have at it!"}
{"text":"Hey guys it's the fat Vegas kid again! Let me tell you about this place, it's EPIC!! The fat kid is very critical about my pizza and I'm more than happy here!!! Pizza was great, super friendly staff!!!! They have some off the wall pizza like a big mac!!! I highly recommend them!!! Tell them the Vegas Fat kid sent you!!!"}
{"text":"Really fresh and cool experience, prices are very reasonable and the staff was all very helpful and kind although sadly I can't include any names since I didn't see any name tags on. (The younger African American gentleman was awesome and had amazing service!) you have enough toppings and different sauces that you can make some really cool unique things I had a bbq feta chicken and pineapple pizza which was pretty good we got 3 pizzas and 2 drinks for $30 and we were stuffed and had some to take home. The sizes arent huge but they are big enough for just about anyone. Only thing I'd like to see here is napkin dispensers on the table and a big menu showing the options behind the counter."}
{"text":"Pizza your way, easy and quick. Everything is customizable and there are so, so many choices. All pies with unlimited toppings are 12\" for $7.99 (additional costs for vegan options and premium toppings).

My biggest complaint is that the premium toppings aren't marked on any of their menus, so you just have to find out when you request it.

Choose a crust (traditional, wheat, or gluten-free) and continue down the line with sauces, meats, cheeses, and vegetables. The process is as quick as you are prepared and then it's thrown into the oven for three minutes.

I went with a traditional crust, red sauce, spicy sausage, chicken breast, meatballs, house blend cheese (white cheddar, mozzarella, provolone), ricotta, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, red onion, roasted garlic, and fresh basil (put on top after cooking). These toppings are my usuals, so it was no surprise that I loved my pie - delicious! The crust/dough isn't my favorite, but it's fine.

If you have an appetite, you can totally finish the whole pizza (give or take 1-2 slices). But for most people, you will have leftovers if you're not sharing. There are small pizza boxes conveniently located next to the soda fountain.

I haven't tried many of these type of pizza spots, but this wasn't as tasty as others I've had (crust and cooking method being big factors). However, it is still good and the location is great."}
{"text":"If you want rudeness as an extra topping for your pizza then go to The Pizza Kitchen. We thought that this employee was rude the first time we ate there, but our second time she outdid herself. While we were discussing what we are going to order she took it upon herself to prepare 2 crusts for pizza we had yet to even order. Then when we started our order she got very irritated that we were ordering only 1 pizza, and the dough of choice was different then she prepared... go figure... her attitude stayed sour the whole time, very sarcastic. Since her mind reading skills didn't work for that I wonder if she figure out that we will never eat there again. \"Employee of the Month\" photo is attached."}
{"text":"GOOD
I loved that there was no wait time.  I was a little apprehensive since it seemed kinda dead inside.  
If you're new to the new pizza trend...it seems to be an assembly line style, personalized pies that are casual, fast, thin crust, and unlimited ingredients on top.  If you've ever been to pieology then this is the same concept but no fire oven.
Pricing was about $8 bucks for 12inch pie.  Not bad since you tell em exactly how you want it.  
Theyll add the ingredients or customize it anyway your lil heart desires.  
Pizza was done in like 5-10 minutes.  By the time I finished snapping pics of place it was done.

Pizza was pretty darn good...

BAD
The girls were nice but seemed NOT to be in to being there.  Everything was transactional no more no less.  Hence the 4 stars.  
I would say the business owners need to invest in being there and in advertising their wonderful place.  Only cause the other pizza place was packed is why I drove in.  Didn't even know the concept til I walked in.

Still a pretty darn good pizza for the price =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Great price and great healthy alternatives. We were also able to do half and half for the toppings. 
The veggies are fresh and it just takes a few minutes for them to cook the pizza. The wheat crust tastes awesome. 
If we eat in we normally get some of their gelato also. Delicious!
Tasted their chicken wings with 3 different flavors. Not the best deal since the wings don't always have much meat on them.
They currently don't take any orders over the phone.

This is currently our go to place for pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good, price is right, ingreduents are good quality.. I highly recommend you try this place. The only reason I cut down one-star is because they sell this horrible gelato which is extremely overpriced (or too small portion, I recieved 1 scoop equalent for $5.95)and pretty low-grade. Strawberry was just sugar water, and the pistachio was probably too old or just gone bad. Ignore the ice cream stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Good value, staff was nice and place was clean. Food was good, close to Pieology (but way closer to our house). Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with a variety of toppings, a reasonable price, friendly staff, and a comfortable seating area make this place my favorite pizza place in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent. Amazing amount for the price if you like your pizza loaded with toppings. Employees were super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First pizza place I have gone to with real vegan options! They have vegan cheese and 3 vegan meats plus a great selection of other fresh toppings. Also they have wheat crust."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in Las Vegas!!!!!!! There are gluten free and vegan options so make sure to bring your friends! :D the staff are super friendly and are always helpful. Make sure to give this place a try"}
{"text":"Went by there on Sunday.. 

This spot is amazing! Very friendly staff, clean and awesome establishment to come chill at. The food prep was awesome and the end result was insane! 

Definitely will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"First time here. 
This place is awesome! 
I forgot to get sundried tomatoes at the end, but the pizza is still awesome!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place.  However,  very disappointed tonight to come here only to find it closed,  at 530 pm one Thursday.  No note on door,  nothing in their website or fb page.  30 minute drive for nothing."}
{"text":"Nice selection of toppings and reasonably priced. Had a sausage pizza and a pepperoni with olives and both were very good. Enjoyed the crust. A nice neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times already! It's is VERY nice & CLEAN inside! Trendy decor with plenty of seating. The pizza is great! We normally go to Pieology which is good too, however, they have rude employees with poor costumer service skills. The Pizza Kitchen on the other hand has very friendly and helpful employees. Makes a huge difference. Their pizza crust is thin but has the perfect amount of thickness compared to Pieology's super thin crust. TPK crust is the best I've ever had! We had a BBQ Sauce, House Cheese (which is 3 white cheese mix) Bacon, Pineapple, Green Peppers, & Corn. Delicious! Also made Supreme Pizza & the Kids had Pepperoni with Extra Cheese and it was fantastic! So much flavor. They will add as many toppings as you want. Want more cheese? Then say \"more cheese\"... It's not that hard. Another reviewer said they \"skimp on toppings\"... WHAT? It's UNLIMITED toppings... So tell them to pile it on if you want a mother load. All for $7.99. BOOM. Great Service, Great Pizza, Clean Trendy Dining... Perfect for family night out! Thanks TPK!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I just went for my first time and I love love love! Better than blaze etc... it's so sad to me that not enough people know about this place! It's super cute inside too! Go try it out! Also I saw a review that said it was pricey, that's bull, it's so inexpensive! Go try for yourself! I got red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, jalapeños and basil! Mm good!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place! 
The toppings are great. And they don't 
Go cheap with them. They are very patient while you order not like some places that have an attitude. They are by far much! better than pizza Rev. The overall flavor and ingredients are really delicious. and not to mention the blond guy that works there is pretty cute as well..lol my only complaint about this place is that I don't like the option of when you pay with your credit card they ask you if you want to leave a tip for the person who makes your pizza it's like your tricked into doing it because it seems like the person who rings you up is always the one who made your pizza. you would've got five stars if it wasn't for that."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 time. Excellent service and quick, delicious pizza each time. I can never decide on one kind of pizza. Last time I got half double pepperoni, sausage, & black olives and half double pepperoni, jalapeno, & pineapple. All for $7.99 (+tax) and ready in about 3 minutes. If I had to complain about anything it would be the boring, sterile decor. FYI they've added a small selection of gelato to their menu. It looked tasty but I had groceries in the car and was getting my pizza to-go. Next time I eat-in I'm trying some!"}
{"text":"I love this place because I love build-your-own pizza places, it's never so packed that you can't get through or find a place to sit, the workers have always been great and polite, and the food is just plain good--especially for the price. I've brought a few friends here and my mom, and they've ve all enjoyed it, too. I'll be coming back again for more!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty!!!!! They were out of wheat crust when we ordered, which is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars. All of the toppings are fresh, the service is quick and it tasted delicious. My girlfriend did mention that at some of the other build your own pizza places, they offer to switch gloves when gluten free crust is ordered to not cross contaminate, which was not the case here. Just a suggestion if the owner happens to read this"}
{"text":"My reminder to not go here next time I want pizza.

It's Saturday night and this place was dead. The employees were cleaning up an hour before closing. I told the employee I'd never been and he said that it was like a Subway for pizza. I was promptly informed that they were out of wheat crust. My whole purpose for coming here was for vegan pizza. I asked if the traditional dough is vegan and he doesn't know?? Ok so I assume it's vegan. I don't even bother asking if the sauces are vegan. They use Daiya cheese. I asked what kinds of vegan meat they have and he said chicken and beef. He didn't know what brand. All the meat looked pretty rank and I think there was some actual green-tinged mold on the sausage crumbles. I asked for cherry tomatoes and this guy hesitated and put some sliced tomatoes on my pizza. What??? I'm done I'm like itching to escape this place and they gotta roll my pizza through some Quiznos oven. Really upset I drove so far from home for this, Blaze is better and right up the street."}
{"text":"I've been here once and brought my cousins along to try some fresh pizza. The ambiance is cute and modern and it was not busy at all when we came around 4pm. I decided to try their vegan options and I ordered the Wheat crust with Garlic herb, Vegan cheese, Regular tomato since they ran out of cherry, Sundries tomatoes, Artichoke hearts And basil

The other side I had my niece share was a regular wheat crusted, red tomato, house blend pizza.

Waited for about 5 mins or so, the first bite was biting into amazingness! It was honestly one of the best vegan pizzas I've had in town. I literally finished my side of the pizza and only shared a slice since my cousin asked. If she didn't, I would of finished the whole thing by myself. Haha"}
{"text":"Out of all the speed pizzerias out lately, this one is my favorite. The crust is amazing and you can't beat the deal. Unlimited toppings. Only thing that would make it better is if they sold draft beer! Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I love it! They are generous on the cheese!!! Fast past! Professional young men running the kitchen! I had wheat crust which tastes amazing! Pesto is fresh!!! They have real BACON! Back area has a big size tv! We are definitely coming back! My 9 year old gives it a two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza for decent prices. We had a large party, I don't recommend that, and we definitely got rushed through the line, but my kids enjoyed their pizza. The salad was too watery, but unlimited toppings there too. Chicken wings were a bit too dry. Overall we would probably give them a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Ingredients are fresh, pizza is flavorful, and service was friendly! Lots of options for people with respected diets! They have gluten free crust, vegan cheese, veggie meat, and many regular toppings! The spicy sausage is yummy!"}
{"text":"At first I didn't know what to think, you walk in, build your pizza with the person behind the counter (more pepperoni please), pay ($7.99 or $10.99 gluten free crust) and then find a table... kind of different.  Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later, I had my pizza.  Let me tell you, this was a masterpiece!  I ate half and took half home.  I was literally sad that this meal was over!  This is a MUST try pizza joint, its all I think about during the week, lol. The people are GREAT as well, very friendly and helpful.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"VEGAN TOPPINGS?! Count me in!!!

My bf & I have been on the hunt for vegan friendly pizza places whenever we're craving some pizza. We tried Pieology but weren't satisfied and luckily I ran upon all the reviews saying that this place had vegan toppings including cheese and meats (chicken and sausage) which was a deal breaker! 

It's only $7.99 for a 12 inch pizza and you get the choice of unlimited toppings. For just $2 extra, the vegan toppings are automatically added to your pizza - such a great deal! We covered it with a bunch of veggies and the pizza was absolutely delicious! 

The sauces (except alfredo and the pestos) are all vegan as well as their choice of crusts (Traditional, Wheat, and Gluten Free). 

There's also plenty of seating in the restaurant and love how it has a \"homey kitchen\" vibe ambiance, just as the name entails. 

We were super happy and will definitely be back soon whenever we need a pizza fix!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! What a GREAT find for the PIZZA lover!!!!! I cannot say enough good things about this place from the time you enter. From the service, the fun and tasteful decor (the flowers on the tables with the colored water was very nice) to the Best tasting crust with all of the yummy choices you can make it your OWN personal pizza. The price for what you get is unheard of. My family and I will be back often. Thank You!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in thinking it would be nice, with a clean lobby and good atmosphere but our pizza was skimped. There was barely any tomato sauce and barely any cheese. And that's not even the worst part, I went to grab Parmesan cheese and looking at it, it had lots of mold. I ask the cook and asked \"how old is this cheese?\" his response was \"I don't know, I think a day?\" 
He snagged it from my hand and just dumped the cheese out without even bothering to wash it. He noticed I was looking at him and just dumped the container somewhere else and just gave me a new one that was basically already empty. On top of that, he had the nerve to charge me 37 cents for ranch!
Never coming back. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great service, very clean and modern joint. Staff was very friendly and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Vegan options galore. 3 vegan meats and cheese

So many fresh healthy choices with no limit of what you can add to your pie.

Fill up on the good stuff instead of bread since the crusts are thin."}
{"text":"I wanted to really love this place since I am seriously missing Custom Built, but I think it was just ok.

To start with, the employee that helped us (young man, I'm terrible with names, sorry!) was very nice and helpful. He explained everything as we went since it was our first time there, and even though I am not new to that type of place, I didn't want to interrupt his schpeal, so I just let him :-)

The place was clean and much larger than I would have thought looking in from the outside. They do have a large variety of toppings, and also build your own salads as well as pizza. The pizzas were also pretty big, and plenty enough to share or have leftovers for later, and at only 7.99, a pretty good deal for that size.

The reason for the 3 stars though, is just the pizza wasn't that great in my opinion. I agree with a few others who have pointed out that they are very skimpy with the toppings. I did ask for more of a couple things, but you can tell they are told to not give you much to begin with. The cheese house blend did not taste super fresh, more like what you would get out of a bag in a store, just pretty basic.

However the big thing for me was the crust. I am really picky about crust and theirs was pre-made, and pretty blah. Not terrible, but pretty much just there to hold toppings. There isn't a pizza oven, and I feel that makes a HUGE difference in getting a good pizza and crust. Custom Built had a great crust, made in a pizza oven, and Pizza Kitchen just can't compare at all with the conveyor heat system they have going on in there.

I think overall, it's just fine for the price, and not a bad addition to chipotle/panera level of lunch, but if you are picky about quality and crust, you may be a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Customer service is great and pizza tastes great! Honestly can't ask for more! Pizza is made however you want!"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about trying The Pizza Kitchen. Truthfully, I had been avoiding it for some time, as I wasn't looking forward to be let down by so so pizza at another new pizza joint. Well, I wish I had tried this place sooner because their pizza is excellent! I also love the modern look and feel on the inside and it was obvious the staff took pride in doing their job well! The place was spotless and they were on the ball with taking the order, processing payment, promptly delivering the pizza to my table and when it was ready and made sure we had everything needed to enjoy our meal! (Not sure who the guy was that was working this evening and delivered our pizza, but he wasn't too bad on the eyes either!) 

I will definitely be returning again soon and highly recommend you try this place if you haven't done so yet!"}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST pizza deal in Las Vegas!!! $7.99 for unlimited toppings?!  Need I say more?  Awesome fresh and over 50 ingredients to choose from...wonderful customer service...super clean restaurant and bathrooms. Your first bite will get you ADDICTED!  Yes, my favorite pizza place!!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Upon walking in, you greeted by warm and friendly staff members who make it their goal to make sure your pizza experience is one you will never forget. They have several different crossed, and several different toppings you can choose from waves just make your mouth explode from the flavors! Make sure you go you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The pizza isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but it does the job. I wasn't too sure about the quality of the ingredients they use, such as the meats. But, what can you complain about when your entire pizza with unlimited ingredients are about $9 after tax and tip. 

I like that the crust is naturally semi-thin. It's between a thin crust and a regular crust. If I could have it my way, I'd make my crust even thinner. The premium pizzas with premium ingredients are a bit pricier, and they have select pizzas you can order. 

I opted for the regular crust, and added a ton of veggies. The crust wasn't crispy as I would have liked, even though I requested it for extra crispness. The pizza itself was enough to fill two people, and not have leftovers, which is nice so that you don't have to eat pizza for the next two days. 

The price is just right for what it is. It's easy and fast, and you can take it fresh home as soon as they're done, which takes about 3 minutes I believe? The gelato they sold (I sampled) was shockingly good. Next time I shall take home some salted caramel gelato."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! It's build your own pizza that they build in front of you and only takes a few minutes to cook. The staff is always really nice too. Way better then most pizza places in the area!"}
{"text":"One size pizza for all! The girl at the start of the line explained all of the different sauces and we ended up going with the spicy one which was perfect. Lots of toppings to chose for your custom made pizza. The cooking time was not too long and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is not busier because their pizza is amazing! The toppings and the quality of them are far superior to Pieology and to pizza rev.  The service is great the food was amazing and luckily for me it's right down the block!"}
{"text":"First off there is nothing better than an All You Can Top pizza place. Their pizzas feed two perfectly and they look absolutely beautiful when they come out. There's usually someone I haven't seen before working when I go, but they're usually always friendly. I'm not sure if that's because I don't go often enough or because there's a high turn over rate. The only problem I have with this place is that they use cheap soda covers, which drive me crazy because they slip so easily if you're not careful. Otherwise this is a great place and I hope it attracts more business so it doesn't close down! It's almost always empty and I feel like it needs to be marketed better."}
{"text":"This place is the best pizza in Vegas!! Built to order and reasonable. You get unlimited toppings and the service here is great!! The pizza is delicious. Tiffany the server does an amazing job! Totally awesome!"}
