{"text":"Veterinary Neurological in AZ is the WORST, OF THE WORST, OF THE WORST. For the most uncaring vets go to horrific Veterinary Neurological. OMG!  Incompetent. Uncaring. Overpriced. Hated everything. Management was useless. (The owner's son is the manager -- has no idea what management is).  Run from VNC!  Also, they totally ripped me off and had me think I was seeing a neurologist when I was seeing ONLY a resident. I paid full price for a neurologist but got a student. I brought my dog Rudy there in an emergency and got incompetent Dr. Philip Schissler. He was so inexperienced, he was clueless about the deadly emergency my dog was in.  (My dog died a month later, he was only 7.) Dr. Schissler even wanted me to pay $3,000 for a pet MRI (all over Scottsdale , like Charles Pullen's office, they're cheaper, 75% less -- only $750. So don't let Veterinary Neurological Center rip you off for thousands.) Dr. Philip Schissler should be ashamed to call himself a vet.    It gets worse, I insisted on seeing a REAL neurologist and they sent in Dr. Jason Evans. Between Schissler, DVM and Dr. Evans, DVM, it was like Dumb and Dumber. Dr. Evans did not even hold or touch my dog. He gazed at me from across the room and when I said I didn't have $3,000 for an MRI, he said \"Then you'll have to consider your dog's quality of life.\" REALLY, Dr. Evans? Put my dog down? How 'bout YOU consider looking at my dog and talking to me about his condition, since Schissler knows nothing,   Bottom line, RUN, do not just walk away from Veterinary Neurological Center. If you want a great neurology team, fly your pet to Oklahoma State University Vet Teaching Hospital. I did that with Rudy next, and they were REAL doctors. Cost 1/2 of VNC's $3000 MRI price to fly all the way there AND get the MRI and much more done!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for a couple reasons.  One, because I think my experience at Veterinary Neurological Clinic was amazing (and still ongoing) and two because I hope my story and recommendation gives people some inspiration and insight if their animal is experiencing a similar situation.  In November of last year, my home and belongings were ruined in a house fire, and my 5 lb. Yorkie mix 3 year old was left inside for the entire duration of the fire.  He was completely paralyzed and basically unresponsive.  After an overnight in the emergency animal clinic, it was recommended he see a pet neurologist.  After losing everything I owned and having little hope Nigel would survive, I realized this office was my only sense of hope.  I took him to the appointment and met Dr. Evans.  I had no idea what news I was going to receive and was mentally preparing myself to have to put my little guy down due to his condition.  When I arrived, the office staff was extremely kind and sympathetic.  I could tell they were pulling for Nigel the moment they saw him and me.  Their positivity gave me a glimmer of hope that he would pull through, but what really stuck with me was Dr. Evans.  While we knew his injury was, he did not order expensive tests to find out what part of his brain was affected.  He simply told me what he knew according to animal science.  His words still resonate in my mind because they were honest and true.  He told me that dogs are resilient and able to recover from the injury much better than humans...simply put, their brains and neuro pathways are smaller and easier to reroute.  He also told me, in a very honest and matter of fact tone, that he did not know what Nigel's recovery would be, but if he was showing progress then there was a strong possibility that progress would continue.  He also informed me Nigel's bodily functions were still in tact, and he was able to eat unfortunately he was able to see very little if anything.  After I was prepped on how to feed him and what to expect as his brain rewired (deafening screams and yelps and cries that did in fact occur), I was sent \"home\" with my little guy and an appointment for a few weeks later.    During the next three weeks, I spent everyday with Nigel.  His recovery was remarkable and fast and still isn't over.  My goal for him was for him to walk into his follow-up appointment.  During the days that followed, he would tip over to his left side almost always, so I began by propping him between pillows to force him to sit balanced.  Eventually, he was able to hold himself.  When he would tip over onto his side, he would want to be on the other, so he would scream and grunt and with all his might until he was able to roll over.  Every day, he soiled himself, so he received a bath in a very large sink - most days the baths happened twice.  This is where I could hold him and he would move/kick/paddle his front paws.  Knowing this was an instinct for dogs when they were near water, I knew it would only improve his muscle movement.  He also began kicking the back legs, although those were much less favored.  Over time, he moved to the floor and stabilized himself enough to try to stand.  Finally, I took him outside to grass and let him very clumsily try to walk.  When he went to his follow-up appointment in December, he was still very unstable and uneasy, but he did walk in the clinic.  Instead of sympathetic eyes, we were greeted by surprise and wonderment.  The entire staff seemed to know Nigel's story and was so happy to see his accomplishments.  Dr. Greatting did his exam in the waiting room and answered a lot of questions while offering more insight into his recovery.  They even approved him to fly home for the holidays.    He was seen again in March by both Dr. Greatting and Dr. Evans.  They both reported great things and said his recovery would continue probably through the year.  Of course they were right, as he is now jumping on furniture and continuing to use his back legs more.  I will never be able to express how truly THANKFUL I am to this amazing office.  They were able to deal with me in my most fragile state while offering me so much hope for their patient.  While the extent of his recovery was unknown at the time, without VNC I know Nigel would not be as remarkable as he is today."}
{"text":"Be very careful if you decide to take your pet here for tests.   I went there last week on the recommendation of a local vet after that vet took x-rays of my 11 year old lab's spine and saw something that looked suspicious.  The resident I saw, Dr. Phillip Schissler, after examining her (and her x-rays from the first vet) recommended a whole slew of tests totaling over $3200 so that they could make a define determination.   I only approved part of the tests, despite their urging to put my dog through all of them and it turned out to be cancer.  There's not a doubt in my mind that  this facility already knew what was wrong with my dog after looking at the first set of films that I brought in, yet they had the audacity and the lack of ethics to prey on my emotional state to push for very expensive tests that weren't needed. Even after they told me that she had cancer, they pushed to do a biopsy to determine what kind of cancer and I said no.  She had to be put to sleep 3 days later because the cancer was so advanced so certainly a biopsy wouldn't have been needed.   DO NOT let them push you into paying for tests that aren't needed or don't make sense and question every recommendation they make.  Shame on this center for preying on emotional pet owners when they already know what's going on - do the right thing and don't put pet owners through any more undue hardship because you have business goals and want to line your pockets with our money."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because when my girlfriend and I were trying to find somewhere to fix our dog I wasn't sure I was going to go here bc of some of the yelp reviews.  Yes, it's ridiculously expensive to do testing and operations on your pet, but it's like that ANYWHERE you go. Yes, they are a business and keeping a team of friendly helpful staff and knowledgable doctors is not cheap, they make money off if their testing and surgery. Like any other center of this type.  Our dog Betty woke up paralyzed one Sunday morning at my girlfriends moms house in AZ we got in the car and drove out from LA as soon as we could to get her to see someone.  We were recommended to go here from another very knowledgable vet in Arizona. From the beginning the staff here was nothing but helpful. They fit us in the same day to see someone and were so kind through the whole process. They needed to do additional testing on Betty bc X-rays were not showing something out of the ordinary to explain the paralysis. Let me note here though that we didn't ever feel the doc was pushy about doing the surgery. He have us the statistics of her walking again and explained other options for treatment if surgery was going to be too expensive. We decided that if they found she had a bulging or herniated disc, which he suspected, we would do surgery. The price tag was huge for us but the staff helped us every step of the way through applying for care credit for half and then setting up a payment plan through them for the rest.  Betty is now on her way to full recovery and it had everything to do with this place. I told myself if this worked out I would write a review about the WORK they do and our experience of the staff, instead of complaining about the price.  Thank you everyone from the bottom of our hearts for giving Betty her legs back! Don't think twice about taking your pet to this place. Yes, they might need to run tests to make a diagnosis but you are in great hands."}
{"text":"I brought my pug to see Dr. Plummer in April 2014 after receiving a referral from my regular vet. Please note that I am not leaving this negative review because of the pricing - I wouldn't expect a neurological veterinarian to be cheap. I also cannot say that the office staff was unfriendly - in fact they were wonderful. My negative review is simply due to Dr. Plummer and the service my pug received from him. Kaluha (my pug) had lost feeling in her back legs, she was still able to walk but her reactions were just very slow & it was getting worse as time passed. She was also beginning to have difficulty feeling when she had to poop. When I bought her in to see Dr. Plummer he had started by first ruling out degenerative myelopathy which I appreciated because I'd hate to think I paid $3,000 for an MRI when a $300 test could've proven it was this disease all along. However, that test came back negative so the only other option was go through with the MRI. It's fair to say that I wouldn't pay this much money for an MRI unless I was also ready to pursue surgery resulting in another $3,000. However, in making the decision to continue with surgery I wanted to be sure that this would help her gain function in her back legs. Dr. Plummer could not guarantee that she would regain function but she wouldn't get any worse & that was a key point in my decision making. Maybe this surgery wouldn't bring my Kaluha back to the way she was but I knew she wouldn't lose complete function so I went through with the surgery. Kaluha was given steroids after her surgery and I certainly didn't expect a quick turnaround but after 1 month and seeing her still struggling I called & asked Dr. Plummer why we weren't seeing any improvement. He put her back on the steroids but this still didn't help at which point I was starting to believe she would be that \"unlikely possibility of never regaining function\". This was upsetting for me but the purpose of the surgery was that Kaluha would not get worse. Well Kaluha has gotten progressively worse since her surgery in April. Now she can't even feel when she has to urinate! Worse yet, she can't hold herself up when she has to urinate so I have to hope that I am near & can hold her up so she doesn't get stuck in it. I brought her back in to show Dr. Plummer that she has gotten worse & he couldn't figure out why this would happen. In fact he told me that it is now time to consider getting her a doggy wheel chair because of her deteriorating condition. He had absolutely no intention on trying to determine what went wrong after I paid $6,000 for a surgery not for a guarantee that she'd get better but for the peace of mind in knowing she wouldn't get worse. He told me I could pay for another MRI to see what's going on... another MRI?! Oh but he was kind enough to offer a 50% discount on this second MRI! Now I guess the only thing I can do for Kaluha is to watch for when I start to see her have signs of pain so that I know it's time to put her down.  The only thing I received from going through all of this is knowing that I tried everything I could for Kaluha even though Dr. Plummer gave up after he collected his fee."}
{"text":"My interaction with VNC is ongoing since we have yet to find the cause of my dogs brain lesions. However, I am completely impressed by everyone I've come in contact with at the VNC. Dr Knowles is extremely knowledgeable and took time to thoroughly examine my dog, ask many questions and clarify my multiple questions. He underwent a CSF culture and and MRI and we are still waiting on results. However based on the treatment we've received from Dr. Knowles and the front desk staff I know regardless of what they find, he is in good hands!"}
{"text":"I visited the Hospital expecting to have a MRI done on my dog. The office help was very friendly and competent. The doctors did a compete exam on my dog and felt that I would be wasting my money by doing the MRI. I am very grateful that they did not just do it just because I was there. My local vet did more testing and diagnosed the problem which would not have been found by a MRI."}
{"text":"I took my miniature Schnauzer in for an accurate diagnosis of what is causing his balance disorder. It was of sudden onset. Having had an excellent experience at VNC in 1997 with Dr Levesque who no longer sees patients but is the founder of VNC, I had my regular vet make the referral and Baxter saw Dr. Plummer. The doctor had to do an MRI to rule out a tumor,stroke or deep inner ear infection. He was able to give  us the good news these were not the cause. It is a vestibular syndrome found  in older dogs that should remit in a couple of weeks. That was the best possible outcome. If Baxter does not back to normal, excepting the head tilt, the doctor wants to see us back. Dr. Plummer has a kind bedside manner and thoroughly explained the MRI scan. He handled Baxter gently and spoke to him like a little kid. :-)  Sam, at the front office was wonderful!!  I wouldn't hesitate to refer someone to a doctor here."}
{"text":"These are some of the most caring professionals I've ever met. And I would like to give an especially big thanks to Dr. Greatting.  The people at this office do not care about your money, they care about your dog. You can go there with confidence that they will not try to talk you into anything you don't need."}
{"text":"When you have dachshunds, you always run the risk of them developing spinal problems, but you always hope you'll escape the dreaded ruptured disc. Unfortunately, we did not. Our 8-year-old doxie developed severe pain out of nowhere. After X-rays at our primary vet, it showed a severely calcified disc in her neck. We were referred to VNC. Our first visit was with Dr. Spore and Dr. Plummer. We spent a lot more time with Dr. Spore, who was absolutely wonderful to our dog and to us, as it was a very stressful, scary time for us all. And although we didn't spend a lot of time with Dr. Plummer, it was clear he knew his stuff. The doctors advised on a CT scan and most likely surgery; however, we tried the medication management route first, as we knew the CT scan and possible surgery was going to cost many, many thousands of dollars. It was clear within a few days that this was not going to work, so we took her back and had the CT scan done. It wasn't good news. Not only had her disc ruptured, but it ruptured in a way that is very uncommon and much more difficult to operate on and fix. But Dr. Plummer felt there was good shot at fixing it, so we agreed to the 5-hour surgery and 4-6 week recovery. It's been just over four weeks since her surgery and the doctors believe it was a success! We are so thankful to the ENTIRE staff at VNC. The doctors are extremely qualified and knowledgable. The vet techs are so kind and caring, and the front desk staff is always sweet and helpful. I literally cannot find one thing wrong with this place, and when it comes to my dogs, I have VERY high expectations. Is it expensive? Yes, but so is all healthcare, both human and dog. When you go to VNC, you are making a financial commitment to your pet. But the staff goes WAY beyond what you pay for. If your pet is having a possible neurological issue, I highly suggest taking him/her to VNC."}
{"text":"My experience at Veterinary Neurological Clinic has turned a traumatic experience into an amazing one. I am certain without the care and love given over a two week period to my Pomeranian, he would not be walking today. It was a simple jump that instantly paralyzed my dog and sent him into excruciating pain. We took him to an ER Vet who referred us to the NeuroVet 45minutes away. Dr.'s Schissler and Evans determined he had a herniated disc and bleeding in his spine. This was a very serious spinal injury and he may not be walking at all, could be in a wheelchair unable to urinate etc...Oh yes, this was a very serious situation. And just a short time ago he was excitedly jumping up to greet me!! It was clearly communicated to me what my options were. None of them were great, they were all huge decisions, costly and could change our lives. I completely fell apart emotionally.  I opted to have the MRI done and immediate surgery if necessary. I was only in town for the weekend and leaving in the morning. This changed everything and I realized I would be going nowhere anytime soon.  Kiko needed to be kept at least overnight to monitor his stability and further determine if surgery was necessary. I have never been away from my little dog; they were very understanding and let me see and hold him before we left. He was in a very sanitary hospital, kennel environment that was heated and quite nice. He was being closely monitored and was wrapped in a heated cozy wrap called a bear hug to keep him warm. I felt overwhelming sadness but was now comfortable leaving him.   The shorter version of this frightening, shocking, two week ordeal, was not knowing if I was going home with my pet or not. Several trips to the Neuro Vet Clinic as well as several late night ER Vet trips to various clinics brought the realization that of all the Veterinarians we have seen in the last two weeks, Dr. Evans and his staff are the BEST of the BEST!  Dr. Evans has apparently been at this clinic for some 10 years and it shows. His definitive detailing of the diagnosis, explaining the MRI, carefully prescribing and monitoring Kiko's meds and managing what others had prescribed, getting us in for emergency appts, taking my weekend/late Emergency calls, devoting all attention and time to us during each appointment, recommending at home care, what to look for, problems that may arise, even continuing health care over the phone when we do travel home. The list goes on and on...   Again, I live in another state but ended up staying two weeks because my little Pom could not travel. My expenses have been phenomenal to say the least. The clinic has been very generous in assisting me.   Dr. Evans is incredibly, kind and has 'put forth insurmountable effort, going the extra mile at all times' to care for my dog and I have watched him do so every time I've been at this clinic with each patient. You will not get better care anywhere. I am forever indebted, they gave me my little baby Kiko back!! I will absolutely be coming back to visit them in the future if for no other reason to say Hello and Thank You again!!  Teres and Kiko"}
{"text":"Dr Plummer took awesome care of our dog Duke. He needed an MRI to diagnosis him right away and it worked they found valley fever in his brain and treated him right away and took amazing care of him over night and everyone loved him and was so sweet to us and him!"}
{"text":"Two of our dogs are patients here.  The responses and care of the front office staff and the vets have been nothing less than sensational. Nola sees Dr. Evans and Pepper T sees Dr. Knowles.  Pepper T, a 5 pounder, has a seizure disorder due to a traumatic brain injury. He has been in several times. They show nothing but patience and interest for him and his condition.  I would recommend them without reservation.  They are terrific. And the charges for office visits, etc. have been extremely reasonable.  Nothing unnecessary or unwarranted has ever been recommended."}
{"text":"A few months ago our dog had suddenly lost the use of his hind legs. It happened overnight and by the time we go him in to see Dr Evan it was unfortunately too late. My wife and I were heartbroken, but I could tell from the first visit that this was it for our dog. Regardless, Dr Evans spent a long time with us breaking down every option in great detail. We learned a lot and he even helped us with a treatment plan. It was a long shot and it didn't work, but he made our dog as happy and comfortable as he could reasonably make him while giving us a little time to hope for a miracle.   I don't have a happy ending to share unfortunately. When we returned for a follow up visit we made the tough choice to put him to rest. Poor outcome aside, VNC desires all 5 stars and then some. The prices were reasonable, the staff incredibly friendly, and Dr Evans absolutely did not pressure us to do any surgery. If anything, he helped guide us to the choice we ultimately made. I know for certain that if he only offered us the best possible outcome and recommended surgery I would have done in a a nanosecond. I even told me wife I'd sell my motorcycle to pay for it.   I hope we never need to return, but if we do there will be no hesitation. Also, if your reading this review and your dog is showing any symptoms do not wait. Time is of the essence if you want a chance to save your pup."}
{"text":"Vet Neuro is amazing!!! If you're reading this, you're probably worried because your vet told you to take your dog to a neurologist. Rest assured, this place will help your baby. I called another place first and they were too booked to see him urgently. I was disheartened and worried, until I talked to Sam. My dog needed an emergency appointment and Sam at VNC personally made it happen. She fit him in last minute around a cardiology appointment I needed first, in order to get him cleared for the MRI. Sam took personal responsibility for making sure he saw the doctor right away. I felt so relieved to have her on my side helping me with something so scary. (He went under general anesthesia for the MRI, so they needed to know that his heart murmur wouldn't be an issue... not all dogs will need a cardiologist first.)  There are three amazing ladies at the front desk juggling the needs of callers and patients. They love animals, are incredibly knowledgeable, and sweet as can be. I am still amazed at the customer service. They called me so many times to check-in on my dog. They treat you like you really matter and you feel very safe leaving your dog in their care. Anything I forgot to ask the doctor, the ladies either called me to check-in and would ask the doctor right away for me, or I could email and they would get back to me very quickly. Sam even told me that my dog really loved Ruth who took care of him the night of his surgery. He gets separation anxiety and makes himself sick, so I was so relieved that Ruth made him feel so safe and loved.   Dr. Spoor personally explains the diagnosis and treatment options in an a way that you can understand, backing it up with visuals on the MRI, and communicating prior case evidence. He also explains step-by-step what he is checking at the physical exam. Before the MRI, he explains the possibilities of what the problems could be and briefly went over the treatment possibilities for each scenario, focusing more time on the most likely diagnosis based on his physical exam. He was spot on with the physical exam diagnosis. The MRI just confirmed it and told him where specifically to do the surgery. On top of presenting such great expertise, he is very personable, professional, and has a great bedside manner. He demonstrated great compassion for my dog's pain and my worry as well. I never felt rushed. He was there to explain anything I needed help understanding. It really was comparable to my personal neurologist visits at the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Spoor wanted to learn everything he could about my dog and was genuinely concerned about helping him... and it paid off!  Surgery was necessary for my dog to live pain-free. He had a herniated disc in his neck compressing his spinal cord about 50% (intervertebral disk extrusion.) It hurt him intermittently to move his head up, so he would often look down or squeal when it was aggravated. Dr. Spoor was able to remove the problem area completely. My dog has other clinically insignificant disks that could potentially turn into the same the same thing down the road if he continues to jump on/off furniture, so now I just have to train him not to jump. (He's part Jack Russell, so that's fun!) He spent three days in the hospital. He was tired and coughing the first day. He couldn't move his head much. By the second day, he was excited to go home and had complete movement in his neck and paws. He is one week out of surgery now, still has stitches in, and he doesn't even know he's sick.  He wants to play, but needs to heal. He's 12 years old and acting like a puppy because he feels so good now. Dr. Spoor completely saved him. He couldn't have lived in that kind of pain and I'm not ready to lose him over debt. Surgery is a decision not everyone will understand, but it's a personal choice for you and your dog. I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful clinic, staff and doctor for such an intimidating, worrisome process.   I was also very worried about the cost of something I personally knew I had to do. (Thank God for plastic!) The cost of the surgery was close to the cost of the MRI. Vet Neuro is empathetic towards the owners and tries to make it reasonable for us. They don't want you to find out what's wrong with your dog and not be able to do anything about it, if there is something else they can do to help.   Talking to owners in the lobby, not all dogs need surgery. Some need chronic medication, some will be partially paralyzed and need wheels. They treat a wide range of neurological issues. I think the MRI (and Dr. Spoor) are truly your key to knowing what exactly is wrong.   Before surgery, I looked online to try to find pictures of what my dog would look like after surgery. I couldn't find any, so I'm posting these pictures of Rufus for those of you who want to know what to expect. (Sorry, if it's too gross for others.)"}
{"text":"All great experiences here! Of course I wish my dog didn't have epilepsy and that we didn't need to come here but I can honestly say I look forward to our annual check ups! My dog Totoro is a patient of Dr. Knowles and I can't say enough about her! The whole staff is great and when I call to refill a prescription or call in a seizure everyone seems to genuinely care about my dogs well being and they get back to me promptly.

Dr. Knowles is honest, accommodating, and patient with my very special dog and has helped us tremendously on our journey through epilepsy!"}

He was so understanding of our needs and worked tirelessly to help us determine what was wrong with our rescue dalmatian. The vet techs and front office team were amazing as well.

This little guys legs were paralyzed and he could not stand/walk, etc. We were so fearful nothing could be done, however, Dr. Plummer performed a miracle on our precious Coco. Surgery was performed on Tuesday and we were able to bring him home on Thursday. Most importantly he was able to stand on all four legs. Will take some time for recovery, but Dr. Plummer anticpated a full recovery!!! We were treated so well by Dr. Plummer, Sam and Laura who show they really do care about our pets. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone. Thank you so much Dr. Plummer."}
{"text":"At first glance, my Yelp buddies may be thinking \"Finally!  She's put the lid on that can of crazy and adopted a new pet!  Too bad it needs a neurologist.\"  Well, no I haven't. That shows you what my list of unfinished reviews looks like.  So here's my review from my August 2011 visit.  Rest assured, it was so traumatizing I can accurately remember the pertinent details.  After my kitty suffered a severe seizure, losing her eyesight, the emergency clinic recommended a neuro consult as they were unable to pinpoint the cause.    So we loaded up our already deaf, now blind, and extremely pissed off family member into the car and  headed from one hospital to another.  The facility is in an odd industrial area, but it was very clean and the staff friendly.  We were greeted promptly and had a minimal wait.  Suzi was first thoroughly examined by an resident.  She was minimally cooperative, but he was good with her.  He then took her to another room for a second examination by a neurologist, Dr. Evans.  We were not offered the opportunity to accompany Suzi, but we were not exactly at the top of her list anyway.  Following Dr. Evan's exam, he did meet with us to report his findings.  His best guess was a brain tumor, but in absence of an MRI, he could not be certain.  We discussed treatment options; however, as she was already 19, I was not willing to consider surgery or radiation.  He suggested a course of steroids which could reduce any swelling causing the blindness.  The only thing preventing me from a 5-star review was the topic of the MRI.  While I did not feel pressured, I was encouraged to move forward with it for a definitive diagnosis even after I expressed concern over her age and current weakened state following the seizures.  I asked if the MRI were positive what conservative treatment was available.  The answer...a course of steroids, the same thing if it were negative.  I fully understand it was their obligation to communicate all available diagnostics and treatments available, but I also understand that I could have easily been swayed to spend $3000 just for peace of mind in my case.  The steroids did appear to help as Suzi's sight returned and she had 3 more months seizure-free.  Dr. Evans' best guess diagnosis appeared to be accurate, as she did exhibit additional symptoms pointing to a brain tumor just before we euthanized her.  I would not hesitate to trust this facility again should the need arise."}
{"text":"They saw our Zoey on an emergency spine problem. They were excellent Dr. Spoor was caring, intelligent and explained everything. Zoey is having her surgery on Tuesday."}
{"text":"In Oct. our cat started having extreme problems with his balance - he couldn't walk without falling over.  I called our vet immediately but she was out the rest of the day and her office referred me to another vet, which I promptly brought him to.  After some testing, she wanted me to take him to VNC for a neurological exam.  This vet wanted to start him on steroids but VNC said no, they wanted to see him first.  The next morning we went to VNC and our cat was examined by a vet, Dr. Evans, who thought he might have vestibular disease but spent a good deal of our time trying to convince us to have an MRI and spinal tap done for $3,000.  While we would do anything for our pets, we thought this price was astronomical and said we would think about it.  We got him to our regular vet the following day and she gave him an antiobiotic shot and steroids, which have totally cleared up the vestibular disease.  If an MRI was the only solution, we would have done it but we had to try other methods first.  Please do research and don't let them talk you into such an expense at a time when they should be offering you support instead of giving you the feeling that this is more money driven than truly caring about both your pet and you."}

{"text":"BACKGROUND  I am an avid animal rights activist. I have detailed my personal experiences with my three amazing rescue animals over the years, including my tea-cup chihuahua, Princess Baily.  I first got Princess Baily in 2006. She was rescued from a situation where her mother was eating her litter. Princess Baily was the last remaining puppy from that litter.   When I got her, she was only a couple weeks old, one pound and only 6 inches long.  Having no experience with small dogs, she was a big change in my life.  Over the years, she's had MANY health issues, including abdominal surgery, mast cell cancer and partial paw amputation, numerous dental issues, epilepsy, and now she has cardiomegaly.  Currently, she is on 5 medications.  Since life with an aging and pretty princess chihuahua is so challenging, especially when it comes to health care, it's nice to find veterinarians who are sympathetic to over-anxious doggie moms.  As you know, I'm extremely picky when it comes to my pets, luckily I found Veterinary Neurological Center.  VETERINARY NEUROLOGICAL CENTER   For over 30 years, the Veterinary Neurological Center has been providing comprehensive medical and surgical care for patients with neurological disorders, such as seizures, back pain and limb weakness/paralysis.   Led by a team of board-certified neurologists and neurosurgeons, the entire staff of the VNC is dedicated to providing the very finest service to each client, pet, and the veterinarians who refer them. Every pet is special and deserves the same quality of medical care as any other beloved family member.  DR. SCOTT PLUMMER, DVM  Dr. Plummer was born in Columbus, Ohio and raised in San Antonio, Texas. His interest in veterinary medicine and veterinary neurology (in particular) was first sparked as a young boy when his puppy developed seizures related to an infection from the canine distemper virus. Dr. Plummer's professional interests focus on spinal surgery.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   When Princess Baily initially started having seizures, I had no idea that she had epilepsy. I had never seen a dog have seizures before and was unaware of the symptoms.  Every time she had an episode, I took her to 1st Pet Veterinary Centers, who finally referred her to Veterinary Neurological Center, and Dr. Plummer.  Princess Baily had several diagnostic exams, including a CT scan, with Dr. Plummer.  Since then, Dr. Plummer has seen her many times over the years for follow ups and has also returned all of my calls. He has bent over backwards to reassure me on numerous occasions, which I appreciate greatly.  The staff is EXCEPTIONAL. One of the most difficult aspects of having a pet with several issues are the prescriptions, and the staff is ALWAYS been VERY helpful. They happily fax over all prescription refills to Diamondback Drugs with NO HASSLES.  CONCLUSION  There is no question in my mind that Veterinary Neurological Center is the best in Phoenix.  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.   *For more information: vetneuro.com"}
{"text":"I had an appointment yesterday with Dr Knowles....and I have to say, I was EXTREMELY impressed.  The only reason I did not leave 5 stars is because we are in the early phases of treatment...so I still don't know if the outcome will be positive with my dog....but based on my first experience there yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is not cheap....but I can see why.    For the past 7 weeks, I have been in & out of the vet with my 7 yr old Boxer, Leo, on average 2-3x a week.  I've seen 7 different vets, between emergency visits, switching from my regular vet to a new vet, an internal medicine specialist, you name it.  I've had ultrasounds done, xrays of spine, hips, hind legs, chest, lungs...etc.  All came back crystal clear.  Blood work...etc.  I've had diagnoses range from a UTI and leaving him in the hospital all day on IV fluids (which i later found out he never even had when lab work came in, and the instant test the vet did was wrong), to gastro-intestinal issues, to valley fever...and have a counter full of medications that my dog doesn't even need.  After spending close to $3800 in vet bills, and still having a sick dog...I was able to convince my vet of what i had been saying all along...that I think he is having some pain in his right hind leg.  Everyone seemed to think it didn't seem like a neuro issue because of his other symptoms, like decreased appetite, lethargy, etc.....however none of that surprised me based on the boat load of different medications he's been put on for no good reason.  I was now not able to tell what was a side effect of the meds, versus what was actually wrong with him.  My vet finally agreed that maybe there was some pain in his hind leg, even though xrays were clear...so she referred me to Vet Nuero Center.  That brings me to my experience yesterday.  I arrived...waited for maybe 5 minutes and they were ready for me.  I've never had such a short wait at the vets office.  I clearly had a lot of history to go over with her.  Dr Knowles really took the time to understand the series of events, and every little detail.  They said over the phone the appt would be about an hour, she spent 2.5 hrs with me....uninterrupted...and it was 100% with her, not nurses or techs, etc.  In prior vet visits, my dog would not respond when examined, so no one could identify where the pain was coming from.  Dr Knowles took the time to understand everything about him and his personality/behaviors.  She did not immediately push the idea of an MRI...in fact, it never came up.  We took him outside for a walk....she tried to get a feel for how he played with toys....brought him a bowl of water.  I've just never experienced a vet appointment even remotely close to this.  Needless to say....after spending all of that time with him, and examining him again, she was able to get him to flinch when she examined him, and located where the pain is coming from.  It was a miracle!!  She gave me her opinion as to what was going on...again, didn't try to push insanely expensive tests on me.  She came up with a reasonable treatment plan....new medications, and lots of rest for 30 days.  If we don't seen an improvement....I would imagine the MRI would be the next step....but for now I am just so grateful she was able to at least find the source of the pain...and has him on a path to recovery.  Based on this initial experience with VNC, and Dr Knowles specifically, I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"***UPDATE- One of the neurologists here came up as a suggested \"friend\" on my fb few days ago. I looked at his page & holy night. So much political diarrhea I was lost for words, until I found them of course; disgusting! I know his political views shouldn't affect his workplace & this platform isn't his job- but his job sure is listed publicly on it & his on n on n on n onnnnn spewing of anti-President Trump rhetoric. I'm a vet & an American... he has the freedom of speech, his opinion, and the freedom to be a jackazz... sure publicly. But the amount of pure hate & extreme ignorance from him, on full public display, while attached to the Neurological Center... I put aback. He will NEVER see our dog! Thank God we have a diff Dr. Steer clear from Dr Plummer if you can! Unless you'd like to have hateful sheepy convos about our POTUS w your animals neurologist. YECH.*** We take our 3.5 yr old purebread American pitbull here, due to her epilepsy. It has been almost a year now. 3 visits I believe. They are very nice here, helpful, and compassionate. We very much like it, and our girl does too. Good job taking care of her, as we are still trying to get the meds part at the right dosage, etc. The neuro Dr we were seeing has left, which we would have appreciated a call on that, which is part of the \"only 4 stars\".   The other part is now that he is gone, a new neuro has to go over her records & make decisions now, and not sure who, but someone was trying to push full blood panel on her, where we cannot afford this often! I'm disabled currently(my meds/therapy/etc are expensive), and we have 2 real kiddos, and 3 animal kiddos. One income. We cannot always do what they say, but being pushy isn't ok. We can only do what we can, period. That was only twice, but twice too many. We still will take her here, just hoping for no pushback in the future.   Bottom line: great place, mostly great staff, professional, and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"First experience at a specialist and so glad we chose VNC! Before we even showed up, the front desk staff showed how phenomenal they are. They were very proactive about collecting Callie's history from various hospitals before she was seen for a consult, MRI, and CSF tap.  Dr. Plummer was incredible and informative, though a little rushed at times, but he made up for it by showing myself and my twin sister(both 2nd year veterinary students) around the hospital and seemed eager to teach us what he could in that short time.  Their facilities are very clean and the imaging equipment is inherently impressive. He also introduced us to some of the other doctors, which I appreciated.  By the end of the day, when we returned to pick up Callie, everyone knew her name and multiple doctors and staff greeted and pet Callie when they saw her walk down the hall back toward us.  Additionally, given any specialty bill is going to be a big one, he gave us a 25% discount because we're veterinary students! I couldn't thank him enough. Callie left with a good prognosis which only increased my respect and appreciation of their business."}
{"text":"We brought our Sadie girl here (female boxer) to be checked out for her legs. Based on her symptoms Dr. Plummer pretty much had an idea of what she has; degenerative myelopathy. Instead of having us go through extremely expensive MRI's and xrays he suggested that the most cost effective plan would be to genetically test her for Degenerative Myelopathyuch first. This only cost a coUple hundred compared to the thousand or so it could have cost for tests that probably wouldn't have led to a diagnoses. It's nice going to a vet that understands how expensive things can get and give you options. To us it showed that they care for their patients more than bringing in another dollar.   Dr. Plummer had a wonderful bedside manner. He was sincere in his concern and examined her thoroughly, testing her reflexes as well as her eyes. He basically checked her from head to toe. He personally called me to break the terrible news about Sadie's positive test results for the disease. I felt he truly nOt only cared for Sadie and was saddened by her diagnoses but he also had concern for us. He let us know if they're was anything we needed we could always call or come in. He even offered to do check ups on Sadie over the course of her diseases progression.   The staff is also very personable, friendly and caring. Also another yelper commented on the expensive tests but anyone who owns pets knows how expensive veterinarian care can be which is why Pet insurance is available but also this office accepts Care Credit cards which for us was a lifesaver. If you're worried about cost apply for a Care Credit card. Plus they're not only good at vet offices but also at dental offices, eyes doctors, imaging and more.   Overall this is a fantastic office with wonderful staff and vets who love their furry patients as well as their humans. If We ever need their assistance in the future for Neuro vet care we'll come here first."}
{"text":"I couldn't give the Vet Neurological Center more praise. For the last 3 months they cared for our little dog Shep who was struggling with spinal cancer. They discovered the tumor and did two surgeries to help slow down the progression and relieve the pain. They helped us every step of the way and began to love him like we did. We unfortunately had to put him down a few days ago, but the team at VNC was right there to support us. They are kind, compassionate and just the BEST. We'll be forever grateful for them."}
{"text":"While this hospital may be far to reach for those who live north of Phoenix, it is worth the effort to drive there.  The highways easily get you there, with easy entry to the front door.  We were greeted by 3 nurses at the front desk, and although we had hastily arranged the visit, the doctor was available to us on time.  Dr. Levine met with us for nearly two hours to make such a difficult assessment seem easy, but to make sure that our small 14 year old dog was comfortable and acted at ease - making for a better diagnosis..  While we were hoping for good news, the assessment showed a possible brain tumor on the right side, that would continue to progress.   Watching our dachshund's coordination fall away for only a few weeks before the visit we knew it was not going to be good news, but we definitely felt Dr. Lavine's care and compassion for our dog. Over the past few months Dr. Levine has continued to monitor and care for our dog. He immediately followed-up on the seizure reports we filed, and took great care in making sure we understood, compassionately, what to expect next. His technical knowledge and social intelligence is well appreciated. Everyone is super intelligent and caring at this specialized veterinary hospital.  I can't say enough good things about their care for my dog and my family."}
{"text":"Dr Ashley Bensfield is absolutely awesome. I was recently referred to the Veterinary Neurological Center by my vet when my dog became very ill.   By good fortune, I was assigned an appointment with Dr Bensfield.   She was super knowledgeable and observant.  She had a wonderful \"bedside manner\" with both my dog and me.   Her skills in making preliminary diagnosis and an explanation of alternative causes inspired confidence in her abilities. It provided understanding of the situation which was a relief after many days of uncertainty and confusion.  Unfortunately, after a subsequent MRI, my dog's condition  was determined to be the worst of the alternatives, which was critical and irreversible, and he was summoned to doggie heaven way too soon.   It gave me great comfort to have Dr Bensfield as a resource at a most difficult time."}
{"text":"The staff here really took excellent care of my chihuahua. Dr. Knowles is great and the entire staff is always so friendly! Took my dog here for an MRI which is expensive, but thankfully I have pet insurance which covered 90% of it. He stayed there over a weekend and they even let me come in on a Sunday when they were closed to come in and visit him. I'm in here twice a month now until he's completely healed and I am so thankful for this place!"}
{"text":"The VNC is a great comfort during what can be very scary times with your pets.  They are fast, efficient, and friendly, and very experienced in all of the issues your pets may be experiencing. Our dog had a herniated disc that was pressing on his spinal cord and had caused paresis in his hind legs. We were quickly referred to the VNC where they got us in for surgery within a day. Chowder (my dog) remained at the clinic for three days in recovery before we got to bring him home.  He has since recovered his ability to walk, and the VNC was very helpful in answering all of our questions about the at-home care and healing process.   We had Dr. Knowles, a no-nonsense woman that clearly knows her way around these issues. Friendly, but got down to business right away. She just knows how to get things done."}
{"text":"Still coming to see Dr. Knowels!  3 years ago my puppy at the time was 5 months old and just quit walking one day.  She ended up being referred to the Veterinary neurological center with Dr. Knowels.  Puppy had the standard evaluation with blood work and all, some labs came back that had the doctor puzzled so she personally called me at 7 pm for not parental history and discuss what to do next. I took Puppy back in for a spinal tap and MRI for more information. She ended up having neospora!  Through her research and long hours, she found out what was wrong. It is a very rare disease in dogs and can be passed on genetically.  There is only one antibiotic to treat it and there are no guarantees it will work, prognosis is not the best.  (I also had my regular vet do cold laser therapy on her spine, acupuncture and chiropractic to help her walk again)  I still have my girl and she has some issues, can't wag her tail, she has a hard time standing up and sometimes can't control her bowel movements but she's not in pain, her hind legs are strong and she is a happy happy girl!  We go see Dr. Knowels and the staff very year for an MRI and spinal tap to monitor for changes.  I would recommend her to everyone after the way she's taken care of my 2 dogs!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Very professional! They love our dog Dimples just as much as we do! She was very sick and had to be treated overnight. If it wasn't for them, Dimples wouldn't be with us today. Highly recommend. All the test that she needed was thousands upon thousands. The doctor was pretty confident that she had meningitis, so he began treating her for that. She responded well, and she is slowly getting back to her diva self that we know her to be!"}
