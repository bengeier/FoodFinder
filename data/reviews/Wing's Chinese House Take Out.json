{"text":"The food is so delicious and totally cheap (averaging ten bucks per dish) and the staff is so friendly. The only issue I have is that the sauce always leaks into the bag. They should find a way to close the dishes or just make sure everything's clean before putting it in the bag. But I can't even take off a star for that, it's such a great place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today, and ordered sweet and sour chicken balls, ginger beef, and chicken fried rice. I phoned in my order in advance, as others suggested, and it was ready when I came to pick up. The price is about the going rate, and the food was mostly great. The chicken fried rice was more flavorful than most I've had, loved it! The ginger beef too, was soft and flavorful. I've had plenty elsewhere that was so hard I couldn't bite through it, so that was a pleasant discovery! The chicken balls were the only thing that I wasn't fully satisfied with, they tasted fresh but were a bit too bland. With plenty of sauce it mostly covered up that fact, but I would like them to have a bit of flavor. The customer service was good, and I will likely be back again, but may try a couple other places first, to see how their chicken balls are. That's a must-have for me."}
{"text":"A mixed bag at best. Ordered on New Year's Eve (a family tradition is Chinese food on NYE); telephone ordering was pleasant and had no problems. Easy pick-up.

The food, however... well, the quality of the ingredients was very good, with tender meat (and a reasonable amount of it). The only item that was poor in quality were the chicken balls, which were among the worse I've ever had in terms of texture, filler, and meat.

But everything else was just... tasteless. I normally order Szechuan, peppered, and curried items from Chinese restaurants. Wing's were just bland bland and more bland. Even the leftovers, which usually have their flavours settle a bit, were flavourless overall.

A shame, because I have to continue to search for a good place here in the Northwest. We can get reasonable Vietnamese just about everywhere, but Chinese food seems to be really hard to find... and Wings sure didn't end my search."}
{"text":"We did takeout on New Year's Eve at the last moment and this place was worth a try for us due to its location. We tried the pan fried dumplings, ginger beef, salt and pepper squid and a vegetable dish in a garlic sauce. Overall it was good food and I didn't order over the phone but only when I got there as their lines were continually ringing busy. It took that as a good sign. From when we arrived and ordered it was only ten minutes. I thought that was very good and she told me their rush time had just finished. I would have no problems recommending any of those dishes, except for the dumplings, which were more deep fried than pan fried. The dough was a little too thick and chewy for my liking. Maybe because I have teenagers or perhaps we really like rice, but I would order a little extra rice next time as well.  In the overall scheme of things, I would not hesitate to go back again to try some of their other dishes when looking for takeout food."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Calgary in my opinion, I have never been disappointed.  Their Wor Wonton Soup is my favourite.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The food was excellent however the service was TERRIBLE! It took almost three hours for our take out order to arrive and we live less than 2 Kms from the restaurant, overall not impressed!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty choices. Great value for the money too. Build your own combos!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese takeout I've ever had. It was bland, cold and just not good. On top of that it was over an hour wait. Not worth it, better choices in Ranchlands like Wok With Dave. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Lately they seem to have really gotten better at estimating delivery times. In the past, they would always tell me 45 minutes and sometimes it would take 2+ hours. But lately they are giving a much more accurate estimate. Customer service has been much better as well. When they're busy wait times can be long, but now that they are honest about it, it is definitely worth it. I try to get my order in early and don't wait too long.

Food is amazing, always super hot, fresh and cooked perfectly. Huge serving sizes for the price!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place over the weekend and it was delicious!! The salt and pepper squid was amazing and super tender not chewy at all. We will definitely order the curry chicken again. My husband went to grab it and he said it is small but the people working there were really nice. Sooo glad we found a decent place close to home!"}
{"text":"RUN, don't walk to somewhere else. The waiting area is filthy and disgusting. Don't believe me, go take a closer look at the filthy couch and trash in the pick-up wait area. You know the kitchen can't possibly be cleaner and, it isn't.

They outright lied about wait times. After already waiting 1hr to pick-up food, they tell me just 10 more min., then 5 more min, then 5 more. After a extra half-hour of waiting around in this shit-hole back alley/receiving dock location at a value village strip mall location, that should have been bulldozed during the last economic boom, I left. no food and a total loss of appetite from the filth witnessed.

I guess if you get delivery, you don't see what I did, but I urge you to go see a closer look for yourself. I doubt you'll ever touch this place again, let alone any of their food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick service, they are absolutely the sweetest people who run the place. If your in the area definitely worth having!"}
{"text":"By far this is the best Chinese food I have had in the city.  Nothing is over cooked and it always tastes great.. Sure certain times of the day get really busy and you have to wait like an hour for your food to be ready.. But that is what happens when a place serves good food.. Just avoid dinner time or get your order in early before the rush starts."}
