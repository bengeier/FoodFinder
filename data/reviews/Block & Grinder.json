{"text":"My group of four visited tonight for the first time.  I have to say it was just ok.  I love the concept and the atmosphere but the service was lacking.  To be more specific, it wasnt our waiter, he was great.  Insead, it was the kitchen staff and their mistakes.  First, we immediately got a table (yay) and we ordered our drinks and apps, the apps arrived before the drinks.  Ok, not that big of a deal but there was more.  Second, we ordered our meals and two of the four dishes arrived before the other two.  Both dishes were cold and the other  two did not arrive until the waiter noticed and had to go to the kitchen and start all over.  The food comes back and was incorrect and the cold meals originally delivered were simply reheated.  Have you ever had reheated duck?  I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, finally tried it last night and boy am I happy about that!! Seated right away and introduced to our great server. Matt was very nice and helpful and obviously enjoyed working there. Gave us some info on the restaurant and the daily specials. Bad timing for me since I'm in the middle of Whole 30 diet and most of them would not work. They were extremely nice and very willing to work with the food restrictions I have. Thank goodness, going out to eat is a little tricky on this meal plan.   My husband and I both ordered specials. Starting with homemade chili lime salt pork rinds, seriously delicious! I had the NC Wahoo with green tomato relish over asparagus (came with rice but it was no problem to sub it out). Amazing! The fish had a delicious crust on it, tomato relish was a prefect complement and the asparagus was cooked well. My husband had the venison tenderloin with a delicious house made aioli and came with fried green tomatoes. One of the best meals he's had here in Charlotte.  We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Mothers Day, it was incredible.  The bacon is homemade, the coffee is delicious French press and my husband who is a burger snob said it was probably the best rouged he has had in a long time.  Can't wait to try dinner."}
{"text":"Great food but HORRIBLE service. Never have I ever been so offended when wanting to spend money.  It was like we weren't good enough for the server. Ignored us all night. Cut us off mutliple times when ordering our meal (even though we were ordering more food), never once did he refill our waters, left our drinks at the bar multiple times, while cleaning tables (and the restaurant was half empty). & we left an hour before the olace even closed. Too many good restaurants in Charlotte to go back to a place where the staff is too good for simple courtsey. I mean, come on.. if you're going to talk negatively about a table, at least do it where they can't hear you.  They lost my business, my family's business, my friends' business, and my company's business."}
{"text":"Easily entering my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte after just one visit!  Pork Belly, unreal! Had an AMAZING prime NY Strip with bourbon butter jam, PHENOMENAL!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. I always love a place that has a wine display (I find it soothing :-) Overall, the decor is welcoming and intimate. The wood tables are charming.   The staff is very friendly. I went with a group of seven women (all divas, including myself :-) . As first timers, we had a ton of questions and comments. Our waiter  was very patient and pleasant.   I went with the B&G burger. It's their classic hamburger served with a plate of standard condiments (lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, ketchup). You can add your choice of cheese and bacon for a few bucks more. I added the NY cheddar cheese and the fresh cut maple bacon. The burger was very tasty. The meat is super fresh and it was grilled perfectly. It was a bit smaller than I expected though. The patty wasn't big enough to fill the bun.   The burger comes with a side of fries or a summer salad. I opted for the salad. It was good, but calling it a salad is a bit misleading. It was a medley of greens topped with a basil vinaigrette. Where's the tomato, cucumber, carrot? Something? The greens and dressing were good, but I was a little underwhelmed.   TIP: You can order fresh meat (steaks, burgers), have them marinated and take them with you to prepare at home.   This is a cute restaurant with good food. There were so many attractive options on the menu, I had a hard time making my final selection. I can't wait to visit again. Next up, I wanna try the deviled eggs with goat cheese and prosciutto, the lamb burger and the Parmesan grits."}
{"text":"Small brunch menu, but what they have is really good! The Benedict was great! Other folks with me said the Elk burger was seasoned to perfection! I'm looking forward to trying the shrimp and grits next time!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place out after hearing so many great things about it.  The food was generally ok, but overall the experience certainly didn't live up to the price.    We really enjoyed the deviled eggs as an appetizer - that was the highlight of the meal for us.  I had the burger, which after adding your toppings, wound up at almost $20....for that price, I was expecting a really great burger.  It was just ok, not especially juicy, not especially flavorful, not especially large; not a bad burger, but I guess the brand that they burn into the bun is worth $7-8.  My wife had the hanger steak, which she generally thought was fine.  We shared the brussel sprouts as a side, and they were pretty bad - very mushy and vinegary and generally not all that flavorful.  Its a nice atmosphere, I appreciate the farm to table mission, and the service was decent, but in terms of a value for the food that we ate, not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I was very excited when block and grinder opened. I was looking forward to a nice local place that had great food; especially steak.   It's a great spot but I feel the good is subpar and overpriced. Portions are good but I expected a lot more for the money as far as flavor is concerned.   I've been a few times now and is want this place to meet my expectations but it just falls short of \"wowing\" me every time I go."}
{"text":"We arrived @ 6:00 pm because they are not accepting reservations yet.  Good move as we were seated immediately.  There were 6 of us dining.  Wait servers leave a lot to be desired.  We had to request water often because of small glasses and no one keeping them full.  When we finished dinner, we had to request our dirty dishes be removed.  My wife and I share a dinner and we had to request another plate even though we stated when ordering that we intended to share.  We expect to return and hope the wait staff is clued in to their duties"}
{"text":"Good food. Had the pork belly for an appetizer and then their house burger with fries. Only gave it 3 stars because the value just isn't there. $14 burger (bun and patty and fries); $2.50 for a slice of cheddar; and $3 for 2 shiitake mushrooms. Burger is about halfway between a regular size burger and a slider / mini so the additions are pretty small. The Mac and 3 Cheese as a $7 side was good, but again, pretty small."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Alexander.  Great farm to table restaurant. 20% off wine when you take it to go. Rotation of wild game. Bison burger was cooked to perfection and the Cubano sandwich was out of this world! We will definitely be bringing out of town guests here to show them the best of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and we loved it!!!  Only down side is it's always packed and we had to wait awhile for our drinks from the bar. We sat at the bar because we had to wait for a table and we were sat before our drinks were even put in the system."}
{"text":"The service and ambience was excellent. The reason I have three stars was based on the brunch menu. The duck hash and the shrimp and grits were pricy for the portion sizes. My other friend had the basic breakfast which had more bang for your buck. I would like to visit this restaurant for dinner though. Again, excellent service."}
{"text":"We have been back to Block & Grinder shortly after our first review and had a great meal. Thanks Kati for contacting us and giving us the opportunity to give it a second shot.  This time I had great bread from the Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal at Block & Grinder last night. Venison special was really well prepared and our friends had the kangaroo game burger which was also very tasty. No rush on service and menu options cover different tastes.  Few items to be prepared for... 1. It is a small place so it is loud. It's a fun vibe and feels neighborhood'sh, just lean in to hear. 2. The wine prices are too high. It doesn't make sense to me that decent wines have to be priced over $50 to start. There are many CLT restaurants that serve great food and have fair wine prices.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Lamb burgers were amazing! Service was excellent. We where impressed with the teamwork between wait staff, any one passing by our table would clear used dishes without even slowing down... Great job!"}
{"text":"My mother came here for lunch and liked it so much that she brought me for dinner the next day - well when we came back the experience was completely different and we were disappointed.   The service was pretty good but the atmosphere was dull and the place was full of well dressed south charlotte white people with designer handbags - I felt very out of place. The chairs were uncomfortable and we were seated in the middle of the restaurant where people were moving around us constantly. It's not a large space and it seemed like half of the people in it were the waiters - I think too many for the small number of tables.   As for the food, my burger was dull and the bun was stale. My mom had the mushroom and gruyere burger again (she had it the first time and loved it) but found the second time around it wasnt as memorable.  Maybe it was just because of the night we were there, but contrary to how my mom felt about it I thought Block and Grinder was a dud :/"}
{"text":"It takes a big person (in this case at least 5'2\") to admit they were wrong and boy was I wrong!  I have tried this restaurant two times before with lukewarm results but last night was so good, I am still thinking about it.  I ordered a steak this time.  The filet was so tender, literally you could cut it with a fork.  The meat melted in your mouth.  Probably the best steak I have had in months.  Hubby had rack of ribs with Cheer Wine sauce that had a wonderful kick to it.  But our service was impeccable.  Forgive me, I know his name started with a D and he introduced himself as De-Nice I think.  He offered up a wonderful red blend wine and knew our needs even before we asked.  I understand there have been some staffing changes and it appears all for the good.  New menu items were introduced by the wait staff.  Don't you just love it when a waitperson actually knows the menu, right down to how a dish is prepared.  De-Nice detailed the new items and then offered up suggestions.  I can highly recommend Block and Grinder for a great dining experience.  And ask for De-Nice - because he was the bomb!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and great portion sizes. Wine was poured generously which is nice for a change. I had the smoked chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus and I cleaned the plate. The wedge salad is also fantastic with real local bacon. Overall this place was awesome! Love that you can buy wine and meat at the same place while still supporting local farms!"}
{"text":"I am not a giant fan of burgers but my husband is, this was a compromise for us because we are definitely foodies and I could be accused of being a bit of a food snob! I cannot express enough how awesome this place is. From the cleanliness of the open kitchen floor plan, the excellent wine selection, superior service and knowledgeability of the staff...don't even get me started on the quality of food. Excellent choice, five stars...no doubt!!!"}
{"text":"I went last night to check it out and have to say they have GREAT food and a GREAT drink menu. The appetizer of the Cheerwine flavored ribs are a must try along with the tasty basil gin drink. They are new so I would say there has to be a couple of glitches in the system, but I did not see it. The food arrived at the table quickly and the drinks were well made even if complicated. Bravo! Now if only I could talk them into adding a few more veggies!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here but our second attempt trying to eat here. Our first attempt was on a Sunday a couple months ago around 7pm and it was closed, like seriously who closes early on a Sunday!? Only in Charlotte...   Anyhow, finally got to try this place and I really don't know what the hyped is all about... My boyfriend had an elk burger and I had the hanger steak. The only two things that stood out to us was 1. how salty our meals were... AND to 2. To add cheddar cheese to the burger was $3 and bacon another $3, really $3 for each add on!?!  What ever happen to .50 - $1.50 add ons?  All in $24 for a burger plus tax ... And I was not a fan of the cornmeal pancakes with the hanger steak... It just didn't work for me.   But, on the plus side, the service was great. Our server, Matthew was really friendly. And dessert was our favorite part. The peach crisp was pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious from soup to nuts!  Seriously, we had the Cream of Mushroom (devine) and the Summer Squash, both were outstanding. We are working our way through the small plates and each one is better than the next. The Hanger Steak and Braised Short Ribs are must haves. The staff is great and deservedly proud of the dishes they are producing!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing I have to say about this restaurant is that the food tasted great.  Negatives: I watched the gentleman who was supposed to be our server adamantly proclaim he was \"cut\" to the hostess--who by the way sat us at a dirty table. After the table was wiped, another server stopped by to say he would be right with us. But then the bartender actually came over and proceeded to serve us.  One of the line cooks literally belched out loud.   The manager (not sure if he was the owner or not--I did overhear him taking credit for some of the décor so...) seemed exasperated that there were people actually trying to come in to eat.  I watched him stand up front and eat off of the hostess' plate--at the front of the restaurant...in plain sight of everyone there!, pour himself a glass of wine, and stomp to the back to work at his computer. I also overheard him cursing while in a conversation with another table--who, by the way, he made a point of saying \"you guys stay as long as you want. When the door is locked...\" This table happened to be next to us and dropped the f-bomb every other f'ing sentence--so much so that my mild mannered boyfriend approached him on our way out and told him he needs to watch his mouth--there was a table nearby with children. We're both from service industry.  Now we're business owners. To me, this is unacceptable crap even at fast food restaurant. If I'm going to drop a couple hundred dollars on dinner, I want exceptional food....and service. Our server, by the way, was fine.  So even though the food was great, I won't be going back.  I'll drop some $$$ in an establishment that brings all the components together, with a staff that seems to give a damn.  By the way, this was a special occasion--though no one there even acknowledged or bothered to ask."}
{"text":"Good meal albeit a little pricey. Service efficient and friendly. Lacks any sense of occasion that the prices imply.  Burgers looked good and seemed well received my steak was small and lacked flavor. Not sure about the return visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for the Sunday brunch and it was so worth it.  The pressed coffee is so great!  I had the special which was a frittata and stone ground grits and my husband had the arugula,  poached eggs and pork.  Then we were too early for a Bloody Mary so we tried the cinnamon rolls.  Um wow! Service was fantastic.  Parking can be scary but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service.  Their spicy margarita is awesome. Had the fried oysters, pork belly, and burgers. Nice meat selection."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a whim, knowing that the concept was farm to table. Everyone at the table agreed that it was a good meal, we were glad we'd checked it out, but none of us were in too big of a hurry to come back. The quality of the food is high and everything was cooked well, but given how expensive it was and how blase the atmosphere was, nothing really stuck out about our experience. Just meh."}
{"text":"I used to love this place not sure if they got new management. I went for lunch today at 12:15 and there was only one other table occupied. I ordered the special which was a prime burger stuffed with Blue cheese. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. Even the bun was a little burnt. Probably my fault for not sending it back The burger had little flavor as I had to ask for ketchup. Much to my surprise they charged me $20. I was with 2 other and they both ordered it and had the same conclusion. Not impressed and won't me running back."}
{"text":"Such a unique place & a great find. Our waitress was funny, knowledgable, and did a fantastic job. The food was amazing. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!"}
{"text":"Block and Grinder is the kind of restaurant you'd imagine in New York City, or Charleston.  TRUE Farm-To-Table, innovative and delicious in a nice laid back, comfortable setting.  Charlotte needs a place like this, and after trying their lunch and dinner menus, I'm hooked.   My friends and I were lucky to attend the preview dinner a few days prior to opening.  We ate what seemed like everything on the menu!  The standouts by far are the pork belly tacos which are glazed in sorghum, topped with napa slaw and perhaps the best part, atop this corn pancake.  The ribs appetizer were fall off the bone delicious, as was the cod spread and their version of deviled eggs.  Other friends that night had the bone marrow and acorn squash soup and they report good things.   What I really like are the tiny touches.  The small homemade biscuits made with grandma's recipe.  The fact the restaurant makes their own aoli.  The really knowledgable servers who are also friendly and good conversationalists.  I appreciate their recommendations and they didn't steer us wrong.   Other standouts include the duck, which comes with a delightful parsnip muffin as a side!  My friend Cat and I could have eaten a whole dozen of those alone.   The only menu item we found could be better, was, trivially enough, the mac and cheese!  Maybe we need to try it again.  It was just a bit too viscous and not cheesy enough.   Oh, and the dessert comes out on a block of wood they call a Sugar Cube, and I highly recommend the grilled pear.  Its light and not too sweet...and strangely enough comes with a Cheerwine sauce that works really well.  A nice way to end a meaty meal.   Good luck to Chef Kent, who is really trying to make B&G a James Beard Award restaurant.  The way it's going now, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to B&G tonight to try out something different. Hostess was fantastic and friendly when we walked in with no reservation, got seated in less than 10 minutes.  One issue is that while sitting at the bar I definitely encountered some sticker shock. There's virtually nothing on the menu that's in the single-digit range besides their sides. I was definitely hoping to walk out for  less than $15 a person but you're looking at $20/person MINIMUM if you get waters and burgers. Word to the wise.   I stopped feeling as apprehensive once our server (Matt) showed up. The \"specials\" speech is a little long but it rounds out a minimalistic menu with some exotic fare. From the beginning to the end service was top notch. Friendly without being intrusive, intuitive to a 'T'. Little things like not offering dessert when I clearly wanted the check are subtle but appreciated.   We started out with the Fried Green Tomato Salad ($14). This is a pretty delicate dish, believe it or not, and as a native Alabamian I was prepared to say \"meh\". Instead I left pretty wowed. Nice and salty, still glistening, ACTUALLY GREEN tomatoes, and a sauce on top that actually added to the experience instead of detracting from a mediocre tomato like I've found happens in charlotte and high end eateries far too often. The greens under the tomatoes were damn good as well.  We both cheaped out and got the Mushroom/Gouda burgers ($14). If you get the toppings separately the burgers are gonna be closer to 20 but you do get (spoiler) great thick cut fries with them. Of course they're referred to as Pommes Frittes here which mildly pissed me off haha.  Burger meat was fantastic. Perfectly cooked. Gouda was perhaps more mild than I assumed but the mushrooms were a little fresher and harder to bite through than I expected. I'd much rather them be like they were than overcooked and super soft.   Buns were almost a contention point. I cook a mean burger myself and almost NOTHING makes me more furious than a bun that gratuitously hangs over a patty. I saw our burgers waiting for us under the heatlamps in this style and prepared to be ticked off.  No dice. The buns were so delicious that I forgot about how lame they looked. Normally I throw overhang away - the buttered bread was good enough on its own to eat. With the burger being out of the park, I can't Imagine how fantastic they would have been if the patty had been more flattened. To be clear I see where they're coming from - the sear on the outside provided a lot of perfectly medium center for my mouth to enjoy. Just a nit-pick I suppose.  All in all I think B&G probably deserves a 4.25-4.5, mostly cause the value quotient just isn't there. It's a small place with an open kitchen so don't expect intimate conversation. They get 5 stars, however, to counteract the people who leave 1-star reviews where they detail how they had the audacity to confront another patron about their language. I experienced no crude behavior whatsoever during my visit but... seriously? Get the fuck outta here."}
{"text":"Been here a good handful of times since they opened and they have just gotten better. Very pale friendly/gluten free friendly for those of you looking for a healthy non-cheat option during the week! Steaks are grass fed and there is usually a wild game option. Servers are amazing and you can go and pick out your own bottle of wine from the wine racks. Bartenders are creative and make some good cocktails. You can even bring home some grass fed meat from their butcher case."}
{"text":"Burgers were outstanding but the steak...well, for a $30 steak in a butcher shop, it shouldn't have been chewy. However, those burgers were enough to make me come back! And the fries? Some of the best I ever had. I gave my husband my steak in return for his fries...boy, that tells you something, eh? The meat was cooked well and was very juicy but I just couldn't chew it enough to get it down. I actually did that disgusting thing where I chewed as much as I could turn discretely took the steak carcass out of my mouth and deposited it in a tissue on my lap. I'm hoping no one saw this but the alternative was to not even have the few bites I did.  We made reservations and it's a good thing we did. Still, we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room/area. I hate that! I'd much prefer a booth - especially as we were the ones courteous enough to reserve in advance. Why not take my preference into account ahead of the walk-ins?  So, menu is good: somewhat expensive, good selection. The spread went between $38 steaks and then burgers which seemed a little off. If I'm having a $100 meal, do I want to be next to a group of college kids having burgers and beers? You wouldn't hear them anyway as it's awfully loud.  The deviled eggs were good - a shot of vinegar really woke them up. The peanut butter chocolate bread pudding sounded better than it was. It tasted burnt to me as chocolate cake sometimes does when it's thin and overcooked. However, the salted ice cream that came with it was marvelous.  We wanted to end with a coffee as it smelled so yummy but they only serve French press and that's not really a great idea at 9pm for some people (ahem..not me...) All in all, a mixed review. If you want an expensive 3-course romantic dinner, look elsewhere. If you want a great burger ($13) in a jumping small place - oh, and the fried were AHHHMAAAZZIINNGGG - turn this is a great spot. It succeeds in one area well but I think they are trying too hard to be a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine, great service. I am in the restaurant service business so I am in and out of restaurants all day and perhaps I'm a little more critical than the average person.  With that in mind I give Block and Grinder 5 stars.  We had the Pork Belly appetizer and loved it.  If you like bacon you will not be disappointed.  Yum.  Next we had a Wedge salad that was very nice followed by the Bone In Prime Rib.  They cut all of their own meat in house so needless to say it was a beautiful cut of meat and it was prepared very nicely at medium rare temp.  Tasty!  We had spinach for a side that was OK.  Erica took care of us and was there when we needed her and made several good recommendations.  Monday night is 1/2 price wine by the glass so we had fine wine to go with dinner.  Following dinner we had a small French Press of Coffee which was definitely enough for the two of us to enjoy with the Bread Pudding desert.  If you like Bread Pudding you are in for a treat.  My loves it and said this was the best she'd ever had.  She particularly liked the fresh figs in the Pudding.  We split everything and still took home a large cut of steak.  I am a guy that prefers dark restaurants so I was happier when the lights were dimmed around 8pm. Overall I really liked the food,  the service and the vibe of the restaurant.  We will definitely be back and I highly recommend that you give them a go as well.  Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Best burger in town hands down, and one of the better steaks I've had (I'm no expert on steaks though). A cocktail list thats actually exciting, and reasonably priced excellent appetizers. I will be back and be back often."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day and the burger was to die for.  Jesus so good.  The server acted a little impatient with us first timers and for that 4stars.  Food is for sure 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. One time for brunch and one time for lunch. Service was great both times. I had the house made pastrami for lunch and it was outstanding. Solid menu, everything looked awesome."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  I can get much better food else where for cheaper and more inviting atmosphere"}
{"text":"I honestly would give this place 5 stars, but only had a burger, which was silly! They also provided a ghost pepper aioli which was solid and added the right amount of kick.   These guys know what they are doing and have a great staff on hand. Cool bar to grab a cocktail, with an awesome selection of Bourbon.   Will be heading back for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted B&G to bowl me over, and I hope that one day it will. A recent weekday afternoon was not that day, even though the restaurant appeared to be fully staffed and I purposely chose a late lunch hour--1:45 -- to avoid having to assess when the place was slammed at prime time.  An older male server was quick to greet and seat, but the assigned server for the table  apparently didn't get the message for a few awkward minutes. Other staff pitched in and took our drink order, so kudos the for team work (and the refreshing  gin basil smash, which was perfect for a summer afternoon.)  A half-size lettuce wedge of butter lettuce, super homemade dressing and grape tomatoes was great in all but one respect-- at least 75 percent of the signature B&G bacon bits were charred black throughout and inedible. Rather than complain, which I really hate doing,  I left the black bits  conspicuously clustered in an otherwise empty bowl to see how the server would react. Nada-- she carried the bowl right by the chefs on the open grill line and into the kitchen without cluing them in or indicating any concern to the disappointed diner.  A cheddar burger was ordered medium rare, but arrived medium with barely a trace of pink, though the high quality grind remained flavorful.  I would have liked to add a pinch of salt, but alas, no shakers [or better yet, grinders (!)] were provided or offered.  While fries get good marks here, an alternative summer salad of marinated cucumbers, tomatoes and red onion was a welcome and bright  low- carb alternative. The gratin dish in which it was presented held at least half a cup of marinade, however, which seemed a costly waste from the owner perspective, and quite drippy for the diner-- though having a real linen napkin was a touch of class and consideration much appreciated.  All in all, B&G offers quality ingredients, but needs a quality control eye on dishes before they leave the prep line. Servers should be coached to back that up, and be a bit more proactive in noting obvious plate glitches. Given the number of comments about off-mark grilling, some coaching there could add a fourth star to this rating."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Great for the whole family or for a romantic date night. Great vibe, wine list, and menu. There is something for everyone! Their burgers are amazing and their salmon is divine! Helpful waiters! Average prices and noise level. Very small, but not too intimate."}
{"text":"Fabulous! A true \"farm to table\" concept that felt like I was sitting in Napa, not the middle of suburban Charlotte. I made a reservation in advance, but the place was dead on a Sunday night. We got to pick our own seat which was nice and our waitress was immediately attentive and helpful. I went with the NY Strip and had the butter wilted spinach and Mac and cheese sides. The steak was delicious and a large 12 ounce portion. The standout item was definitely the Mac and cheese - TO DIE FOR....I promise. Can't wait to be back to try the burgers and brunch!"}
{"text":"The Block & Grinder concept specializes in premium beef, all-natural and organic meats / wild game. Their goal is to create a \"back to the basics\" menu structured around fresh ingredients.  Our night started off with a small charcuterie sample plater and some fresh made biscuits followed by the small plate of pork belly with a bourbon & sorghum glaze over corn bread pancakes and topped with a green slaw. This was easily one of our favorite dishes of the night and from what we could hear around the restaurant it was a big hit with everyone else too.  Next up we tried the dry rub smoked berkshire ribs with a Cheerwine bbq sauce and pickled slaw. The first thing we loved about this plate was its impeccable presentation and bold flavor. The ribs had a delightfully crunchy exterior with with perfectly tender meat and the sauce was full of bold flavor.  For our entree's, Ella started off the night with the butter poached rack of Carolina rabbit with a loin & leg roulade over stone ground grits. The leg roulade was a delicious twist on such a fun choice of meat. The grits complimented the rabbit really well and had a great sauce, I just wished there was more great sauce. Though the rack of rabbit on top looked nice I found it a little unnecessary.  I couldn't figure out whether I wanted to try a steak or a burger, so I got both.  The bacon and cheddar and burger was toped with thick cut slices of house cured maple bacon and NY cheddar cheese with a side of fries. The fries were nothing special but the burger (especially the bacon) was absolutely divine. I closed my eyes after every bite and transcended to a state of burger nirvana that could perhaps only have been surpassed with the addition of some sweet caramelized onions on top. The only complaint I had at this point in the evening was that there was no ranch dressing.. anywhere... in the whole building. I became addicted to fries dipped in ranch the very second I moved to NC and not having any ranch was a significant let down for me. The fries weren't amazing to begin with but without the sweet and loving caress of creamy ranch dressing they were a little worse.  Being the giant man that I am (175lbs) I decided the charcuterie, the pork belly, the ribs, and the burger just wasn't enough food quite yet so I got the 20oz porterhouse. Unfortunately it wasn't what I was hoping for.  I cant speak for every steak, but my steak was completely devoid of any flavor at all... except for one bite. There was one single bite that seemed to have all of the flavor of the entire steak crammed into the one bite and the rest of the steak was bland and completely forgettable.  For dessert we went with the earl gray creme brûlée with sugar biscuit and the bread pudding.  The Earl Grey Creme Brûlée was not only the best thing I ate that night, but the best creme brûlée I have ever had. The flavor of the tea blended perfectly with the rich creamy texture of the brûlée. To top it all of the sugar biscuit added a carmel flavor and crunch that was even better than the torched sugar usually sprinkled on top. This dessert is a must have in my kitchen! The bread pudding was decent but forgettable by most accounts.  Block & Grinder is an amazing concept with a great menu. We had a great evening and are looking forward to seeing the restaurant grow and succeed. Check them out if you're in the area and let me know what you think :)"}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Much better treatment of steaks and vegetable sides than the big steakhouse chains, with a much more relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere.  Everything is fresh, perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Charcuterie is always a highlight, and by far the best we have had in Charlotte.  Our go to location whether we are entertaining out of town guests or just a quiet weeknight out by ourselves."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have recently moved to Charlotte and he wanted to plan our first official date night. After doing some research and receiving recommendations from co-workers, he decided on Block and Grinder. We were very excited to try this as it had great reviews and 99% of their products come from North Carolina - making this a true Farm-to-Table style restaurant.  We started with the deviled eggs as we were told they were one of the most popular apps on the menu. I love eggs any way you cook them so I knew regardless I would enjoy them. My only gripe with the eggs was that the menu states they are made with goat cheese (yummm) - I could not taste any goat cheese, but instead an overwhelming amount of truffle oil. But, as I mentioned before, I still enjoyed them nonetheless.  For dinner, I ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare Au Poivre style and it was absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend ordered the bone-in Ribeye which was also very good, but even he admitted that mine was better and when we come back that is what he would order (as would I because it was so delicious). We also happened to go on a night where all wine bottles under $60 were half price, so not only did we have delicious, melt-in-your-mouth steaks, but we also had sophisticated wine to pair with them.  Service was exceptional as well. Our server Chris was excellent. Once we informed him that this was our first time dining there he gave us a run down of the entire menu and also some interesting facts about the restaurant. He also gave us several recommendations of other food places we need to try as we are very new to the area and have not had the chance to discover all the \"hidden gems\" here.   I have already recommended this restaurant to many and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! For a restaurant that showcases its' meat, it seems laughable that the hamburger meat quality was not as good as Burger King, complete with gristle and was overlooked. The seasonal salad had zero flavor, fries came out soggy the first time. The unsweetened ice tea was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Block & Grinder; the first two were definitely 5 star! The entire wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful as usual. From the moment we entered the door until we left, we were well taken care of. My wife and I split the Hudson Valley Foie Gras appetizer; even though extremely small, the quality was excellent. We then each had a Boston Wedge; each was superb as usual with the House Cured Bacon exceptional. My wife ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare; upon arrival, the meat was not recognizable as Filet Mignon and was extremely rare. Trying to cut the steak, she found the meat very tough. I ordered the  Bacon Cured Salmon. The presentation was beautiful; the taste was terrible as if the meat had been fermented! We will go back but sincerely hope the owners read and take to heart reviews like this!"}
{"text":"Tried this with a girlfriend and was blown away by the quality of the food.  We started at the bar with drinks, and the cocktails were fantastic--hand-muddled basil, a terrific old-fashioned, some great martinis.  Then we moved to dinner in the dining room.  Both of us had burgers, and the meat was ground fresh that morning.  Probably the best burger I've had in ages--it was so moist and juicy.  I got the bacon cheeseburger (and I rarely get cheeseburgers, but I knew this one would be good) and it was just delectable.  Before this, I would've said my favorite burger was at Fran's, but I think this surpassed it.  My friend got her burger medium rare, but it was so fresh we weren't even worried about the meat quality.  Then the owner came around and talked to us--very charming.  And the wine pours were impressive!  I'd go back in a heartbeat.  It's not in my neighborhood--it's in Cotswold, and I'm in Dilworth--but I'll move around for that food.  And I thought the prices seemed incredibly reasonable.  Yes, yes, yes."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Block & Grinder in the South Park neighborhood of Charlotte.   This farm to kitchen restaurant's philosophy is \"Back to Basics\" with a menu \"structured around appreciating every fresh ingredient.\"  One option was a Wild Game Burger. This day's choice? Kangaroo served with a tomato aioli. Now I have never tasted Kangaroo but I am always open to trying a new taste.    They import their Kangaroo from New Zealand and serve it along with other wild game including camel and elk. The Kangaroo burger was outstanding, cooked perfectly and serve on a toasted bun imprinted with a B & G.   Instantly, you know it is not a beef burger with the distinct \"wild\" flavor, much like a venison burger, but earthier. The homemade fries were crispy and just the way I like them.   Dora here. It was the day for trying new things all around. Topped with feta cheese and served with curry aioli, the Lamb burger could've passed for beef. I'm not sure if that's good or bad for Lamb lovers. :)   I just know that I enjoyed the lean, smoky flavor and I'm a huge fan of feta. I tried the aoili, but preferred it without. And I'm with Ernie. The fries were perfect.  Service was attentive and for the most part quick, and the wait staff helpful and knowledgeable.  Just a note. When you order unique options, they tend to be a bit pricier.   Dora here. Gulp. You're not kidding. Two burgers, one iced tea, and no appetizers = $47. Yowzee! Better save up your pennies.  As I was saying, don't let that discourage you. Go for it!   We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.  ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was my high expectations for Block and Grinder, but the food and atmosphere was just not all that for my friends and I.  I made a reservation earlier in that day for a table for 3 and when we got there, I didn't see my name in their book... but there was literally nobody else in the restaurant so it's not like we needed one anyways (on a Tuesday evening).  The atmosphere here was severely lacking - maybe it was the boring, chain restaurant-like decor and furniture, the weird lighting, or the fact that it was completely empty for most of the night except for our table.  Service was okay... nothing to call home about and they could definitely use some smiling.  The food came out fairly quickly after we ordered.  We ordered the special 18 oz prime rib eye of the night (not knowing it was $55, of course) and it was definitely cooked medium rare, but was a little on the cold side for me.  The meat was really hard to cut with the steak knife they provided me with for some reason - was having some real struggles there.  However, for $55, I have definitely had better rib eye else where, like Del Frisco's.    In addition to the steak, we ordered a trio of charcuterie and a trio of sides.  The charcuterie wasn't specactular - the spicy chorizo and wild boar sopressata you could most definitely find at your local Whole Foods at $8-9 for an entire sausage rather than the few pieces you get here.  The mustard and crostini was good.  The drunken goat cheese I've had elsewhere was much better.    As for the sides - the mac and cheese was the best dish of the night probably, but was very runny.  The grits were probably the worst dish of the night, as they had absolutely no flavor or seasoning whatsoever and seemed undercooked.  We had to add a ton of salt because it was so, so bland.  The sweet potato puree was pretty standard.  We also ordered the pork belly dish to start.  While it was beautifully glazed/caramelized on the outside, I have never in my life had such chewy, jaw-breaking pork belly in my life.  It had good flavor, but I'm just unsure as to how it was cooked because it literally made my jaw sore to chew through.  It was basically like rubber.  I'm not sure if this was just a terribly off night because nobody else was eating and if the food was stale because of that or what, but our experience definitely was not on par with the raving reviews on Yelp.  Everything was also overpriced, in my opinion.  Over $100 for not that much food.  Definitely better dining options in Charlotte after our experience here."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was great. What a gem! The staff was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. The wine selection was great. I actually sat down when the wine rep was there... Almost every server and manager tried an array of wines before approving any for sale. They rejected several before landing on two bottles.  I got the cheeseburger and it Honestly was one of the best I've had in recent memory in Charlotte. That Brioche bun was amazing and the burger was cooked to perfection. They said they grind their burgers in house...pretty cool. They said they sell the burgers in a premade set. I'll be back for sure before my next cookout.   Given that it wasn't very busy when I was there (3pm lunch), the Chef had time to come over to me and ask me how my food was. We got to talking and I was super super impressed with this guy. He really knew his stuff and had an enthusiastic creativity about him that really shined through on the menu choices he prepared. I could tell he takes real pride in his work.  I will be back again... Especially to try those Devilled eggs my server was telling me about!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an ostrich burger this place is the spot. Truth is though why pay 26 for a dry medium ostrich burger when you can get a delicious greasy beef burger from anywhere for 10 bucks. If ostrich is your thing sure, but think there's a reason this country produces so much beef, it tastes better than anything else."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!   Server was in serious need of training.  Food delivered to the table and she waited until we were half way thru the meal to check on us...even with the restaurant less than half way full."}
{"text":"Farm to table restaurant and butcher shop serving up delicious plates. This has been on my list for a while now, so when my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner I was super excited.   We started off with the Pork belly. It's crispy, get portion size and delicious. Get it get it! The slaw is paired perfectly on the cornmeal pancake. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  For dinner I had the Hanger steak with sweet fries. It was cooked perfectly per my request and wedge style of fries. My favorite!  Dessert for the birthday girl was Expresso crème brûlée.   I will be back! I must try the deviled eggs with prosciutto and their brunch menu looks fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for a burger, and not just any burger. Something gourmet. B&G was it. The choices of all style of food is unreal. I had the Cajun bison burger. Wife had the signature,  son had the wild game burger of the day which was kangaroo of all things and my daughter had the sliders. All were prepared perfect and all tasted great. The dessert didn't stink either. And I love restaurants with a coffee press, which is what we had. Just be careful about pricing,  which was my only reason for giving it 4 versus 5 stars. It's up there price wise. However, it was worth it. The chef came around to talk to every table and our waitress was spot on. 5 star food and service, but again, don't forget it will cost you. But I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Favorite steak house! Food is always amazing, steak cooked to perfection. Service is always great. I had the hanger steak with potatoes & spinach. My bf had the NY strip and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"When you go to Block & Grinder, I hope you're lucky enough to meet Chef Kent Graham. If you only talk to him for one minute, the passion for his food is loud and clear. It comes through in his wonderful inspired meals. Great to have a meal from a chef that truly loves to cook. I was meeting friends for dinner and I got to B&G before they opened, luckily they let me in anyway. And guess who was there?? My CM Ben G. and his lovely wife JJ! I knew I was in for a treat then lol ;). The restaurant is beautiful on the inside. Chic but simple with cool wooden menus. I had one of their handcrafted cocktails...Blood Water while I waited on my guests. Very nice with a little spice from the Ginger Beer and Creole Bitters and the \"Blood Garnish\". My waitor Jeff was very nice, he and I and Chef Kent got a chance to talk before they were officially open for the evening. Chef Kent shared that they may be adding a late night offal's menu. Kind of like an offal tapas! This is great for those (like me) who may be a little leery of \"variety meats\". As of now I think B&G is the only restaurant offering offal in the Charlotte area. Chef Kent lights up when he starts talking about it...it's going to be great! Anywho, for dinner, I had the Spring Chicken. It came beautifully perched atop a sweet potato arugula and onion hash. This wonderful hash had BACON in it!!! Bacon that's made in-house of course, like everything else. I don't eat pork but, I ate every single little bacon bit (wich was more like small pieces of lardon). Darn you bacon! You gateway meat!!! The chicken was cooked perfectly, it was juicy with crisp skin. Both of my guests had burgers. One had the Bacon Cheddar and the other had the Lamb Burger which is an homage to Chef Kent's favorite chef. I heard no complaints from either. B&G also has a small wine cellar where you can go and pick out a bottle and bring it back to your table. It's hard to chose between the great selection of wines and cocktails. You can't lose either way! B&G is unique in offering a retail butcher shop along with a restaurant. I love the concept. You know right where your food is coming from and where it's made. Super fresh!!!!!! Check this place out, I'm going back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Best burger in town.   Better than Bad Daddy's or Liberty!  Toasted bun to perfection !  awesome fires!    Very friendly!"}
{"text":"I went here based on raving Yelp reviews and was so disappointed. While they have a wonderful atmosphere and awesome cocktails, I was completely underwhelmed, as was the rest of my family. We tried the deviled eggs, which were pretty good, but the rest of the meal was lackluster. Our burgers were all overcooked and dry, and for the price, pretty small. We were so excited to try the meat that is local and fresh, and were so disappointed when it didn't come through. Our waiter was excellent, but nothing else was much to write home about. After spending $75 on 4 burgers, 5 deviled eggs, and a glass of wine, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I and a few friends came to this restaurant not knowing anything about it. We walked in and it seemed pretty casual for starters with a case to your left full of meats you can buy to take home like going to a butcher. This is when I learned it was a farm to table restaurant with grass fed animals. Staff was very friendly and welcoming from the get go. We started with the pork belly appetizer and fried oysters on salad with spicy aioli. They both pretty tasty. The pork belly was a sweet flavor on a bed of slaw. Three of us order the game burger which happened to be elk this particular night. The meat itself was a very lean and tender meat but mot a lot of flavor. The pepper aioli sauce was great on there but not my favorite. I would recommend the elk since it is a great tender meat but lacked seasonings. One had the lamb loin on rice with zucchini and squash which looked and smelled very good. He and his wife boasted about the flavor of the lamb and rice. I will definitely be getting the lamb when I come back."}
{"text":"Just experienced Block & Grinder's new brunch menu. There aren't enough stars! SO amazing! Premier service! AmAZing food! Had Shrimp & Grits with scallops and venison sausage. DANK! Tasted the Duck Hash. SUPERB! And their Potato Cakes are like nothing I've had before, but want over and over again. Oh, and let's not forget the perfection of their Pork Belly appetizer (available on other menus as well). Always a great experience. Both in taste and service. Breakfast, lunch and now brunch. KUDOS B&G!!"}
{"text":"This place was alright.  It's super pricey, but to be honest, I don't think it deserves the steep price tag.  You can get crazy fancy stuff here like bone marrow (not my cup o' tea but hey...you can get it).   I got a veggie burger, and while it was branded with the letters \"BG,\" it just didn't stand out too much otherwise.  Dinner for three was about $200. Yet, the place is in a shopping center.  If you wanna impress a snooty person, bring them here. Otherwise, Red Robin has a similar tasting veggie burger for 7 bucks."}
{"text":"The same group of friends and I returned a couple weeks ago. The food and service experience. I will be taking my in laws here next time they visit. I am glad thing turned out well, and really excited I can recommend this locally family owned small business."}
{"text":"Quick recap: might be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Nothing short of amazing. Phenomenal steak, incredible sides, genuine and knowledgable  service.   The pork belly was amazing. Full of flavor and well cooked. The lamb appetizer was also incredible. The filet minion was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. It melted in my mouth. Absolutely the best steak I've had anywhere.   Wild mushrooms were full of favor and was enough to share. The same with the mashed potatoes. The fries were good but if I had to recommend a side, stuck with the mushrooms or mashed potatoes.   Got an old fashioned and it was perfectly prepared. If I had any sort of complaint, it would be that this place is too small. I wish they could seat more people bc this place is popular and it's popular for a reason. Impeccable."}
{"text":"A great add to lake Norman - as good or better than the usual suspects-kindred epic fork dressers mooch Caruso.   Kinda foodie farm table but laid back enough to enjoy.   Good service and great set up inside.   Craft beers cocktails and some kind of great food for all. Worth a visit"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very nice atmosphere inside and outside.  I had the hanger steak with truffle fries. The steak was great. The fries ok. I never understood the hype with truffle fries. My friend ordered the Mahi mahi dish. It was really good. Cocktails were really great. I'd go back and try different dishes."}
{"text":"I would like to Thank the staff at Block and Grinder for the fabulous night. It was my daughters 16th birthday and the night was very important to us. From the 1st call to make the reservation the whole experience was terrific. We were all treat like royalty from the moment we walked in. The food and service were perfect. I am not one to be shy when something is not right but also one to compliment when something is good! In thius case it was GREAT... Congratulations on a job well done and Thank You for making this important night so special for my daughter! PM"}
{"text":"I was sad to be underwhelmed by this place.  The spinach salad was fabulous - the first one I've ever had that came with sweet things (e.g. candied pecans) and goat cheese and was not covered in absurd amounts of them.  What disappointed me was the service and the standard burger.  The burger seemed salted only on one side and the other had very little flavor at all.  There was also a lot of gristle in the burger and it was very tough.  (It was not overcooked - medium well, so I don't know why it was so tough). The service disappointed me in that the burger was just plunked down, and the salad plate not removed so I had to maneuver things myself.  The waitress also seemed kind of checked out, which was weird.  The host was great, though.  I would come back to try some other things and for the salad, but not for the burger."}
{"text":"Very good. Friendly and patient service. The ribeye was juicy and delicious. The bone marrow was very flavorful. My wife had the salmon which was delectable. One son had the bison burger and my other had the lamb burger. Both were excellent. We all shared a pan fried corn and it was a perfect accompaniment as a side. The menu included pork belly, elk burger, and venison tenderloin. I wish my stomach was bigger but they leave more for the next visit!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to Block & Grinder on a Sunday night for the first time.  We were immediately seated in the small, narrow dining room at a table closest to the door (and the meat counter, so I had a view of raw meat all night).   It was 30-something degrees out, and the way the dining area is situated, we got a blast of cold air every time someone walked in and out the front door, which was a little too often.  We had to keep our jackets on throughout the entire meal.  And since my chair was in the wooden-floored aisle, I felt each every step servers and customers took as they walked behind me, and there was a LOT.     Besides that, we weren't very impressed with the design of the dining room.  The restaurant seems like it's trying to be \"intimate,\" but with the way the tables are, some directly facing the open kitchen, some tables close so close together you can hear your neighbor's conversation, and my view of raw meat, it doesn't feel very intimate, especially for the prices and the great selection of wine they offer.  If they want me to spend $30 on dinner and another $10-15 on a fine glass of wine, I feel I deserve a bit of intimate atmosphere.  The back of the restaurant seemed nice and more intimate, but there are only a few tables there, the rest of the space being occupied by huge walls of wine bottles.  I think the wine should have been where I was situated to create a partition between the front entrance and the dining room, and I should have been back there enjoying a nice dinner.    That said, we had just wanted it to be a casual night out.  All we wanted was to try their burgers and not spend a lot of money on a big, fancy dinner.  While the lunch menu seems like it has a lot of great sandwich options, we were pretty disappointed with the dinner ones.  There weren't a lot of burger options for a place that prides itself on its meat.   There was one lamb burger, one veggie burger, and three beef burgers: cheese, cheese & bacon, or mushrooms & cheese.  Really?  That's it?    I ordered the cheese & bacon burger, with a side of a wedge salad.  The restaurant wasn't that busy, but the salads took FOREVER to come out.  There were certainly enough chefs behind the counter that I could see.  Was the salad chef not in?  These are SALADS, people!  They should not take 15 minutes.  The salad finally came and it was actually one of the best wedge salads I've ever had.  It looked more like bibb lettuce than iceberg, so it was a lot more tender.  And the blue cheese dressing tasted fresh and homemade.   Of course, since they came so late, we weren't finished with them by the time our burgers arrived.  It wasn't the server's fault. I could see that he was waiting for the chefs to prepare the salads and put them up for pick-up.    The burger itself?  Meh.  I'm sure the quality of the meat was fantastic and it tasted good, but when I order it cooked medium and the server even tells me that medium is red in the middle, I don't expect a well-done burger on my plate.  On top of it was the smallest melted piece of cheese.  It was so minute and thin that you wouldn't even know it was on there, so I certainly never tasted it with each bite.  The bacon was thick, but a little too well done as well, and there wasn't much of it.  That was the extent of my burger.  No other toppings or dressings.  A well done burger, well-done bacon, and barely any cheese on top of a dry hamburger bun.  Needless to say, I needed my water glass refilled several times.    On the other hand, the French fries that accompanied the burger were amazing.  They were truffle-flavored and tasted delicious.    Would we go back?  Most likely not.  I can get a tastier burger at several other places in town:  Bad Daddy's, Cowfish, or even Red Robin.  And if I want a great steak, I'd want a place with better atmosphere where I'm not shivering, having my seat jostled every time someone walked by, or staring at a brightly fluorescent lit meat case throughout dinner."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once. Very nice restaurant with delicious burgers. A bit pricey though. Our 2 burgers with cheese and fresh cut fries with tea came to nearly $50. There are just as great burgers in town for a lot less. Not saying I won't go back. Maybe when I have out of town guests. But for a casual lunch, I prefer not to spend that much."}
{"text":"I dine here every couple of months. The quality of the food is unmatched. The wild game meats are always paired with great sides that compliment very well. Great cozy atmosphere,  phenomenal wine list and incredible service round off this farm to table restaurant. I love it, love it, love it. Ask for Amy or Rod. Oh yeah the cocktails are super creative and interesting."}
{"text":"I'm already planning our return.  Block & Grinder offered an experience that I couldn't possibly argue with. The food was amazingly delicious, our waiter was fantastic, and the atmosphere was cozy and nicely done.   We had heard good things and weren't sure what to expect after hearing it was also a butcher shop. We were pleasantly surprised. We were seated immediately and our waiter instantly approached us and was charming right off the bat. We are huge meat eaters and were already rereading a menu we memorized before heading there and were trying to contain our enthusiasm while ordering. After rattling off the specials, we skipped (due to my dining companion and to my dismay) the pork belly app and instead had the scallops and the bone marrow. The scallops were fantastic and came with a little pork belly so it was like a two for one and they were a hit.   Our waiter advised that he enjoyed the bone marrow with his steak so we did the same and waited till our entrees arrived. My boyfriend got the half rack of lamb in mint pesto with sweet potato hash and Brussels sprouts. They were fantastic. The mint wasn't overwhelming, the lamb wasn't too gamey, and I really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts.   I had the 22oz bone in ribeye in a veal demi and a side of asparagus. Moment of silence please. Holy heavenly delicious. It was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked and I was sad once I was towards the end. Also, our waiter was completely correct- the bone marrow with the cuts of meat was a great combination.  There was a lot of food and we split everything but we cleaned our plates entirely. On top of that, unbeknownst to us, it was half price glasses of wine, so that was a great added bonus. We really felt we walked out eating very well for a very very decent price. Getting a 22oz cut of meat at a well known pricey chain would have been 2-3x the cost. So, Between the salivating worthy food, our great service, and the nice atmosphere we will most certainly be back. Very soon."}
{"text":"I feel really sad about writing this because I absolutely adore the concept.  And I loved the food - when I could get it.  But top to bottom Id say the service here is spotty at best.  I've come twice now with the intention of eating food and left before that could happen, because it just took too painfully long.  Combine that with servers and bartenders having zero knowledge about what they're selling/making and host/management staff that have zero concept of how to seat people appropriately - and you get a huge disappointment.  I've been here 3 times - on the first visit, while the bartender was also our waiter and it took forever to get drinks,  the food was awesome and made me happy.  Second time - we were just literally and entirely forgotten.  Left after (terrible and delayed) cocktails because it was just too annoying.  Finally decided to give them another try tonight, by making a reservation we showed up 5 minutes early for - and were very happy to order a cocktail at the bar while we waited.  But 25 minutes later, after paying $40+ for 3 drinks we were still completely avoided. Not even asked for a refill or request for a glass of water.  There was no acknowledgement of our waiting.  I love servers and restaurants and appreciate them so much - but no matter the food, the service is a factor, and this place has a problem."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burgers! Had the B&G burger and fries with garlic aoli on the side, perfect. My boyfriend had the lamb burger  with summer salad and cleaned the plate. Great costumer service as well. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Steak steak steak delicious steak.  Great atmosphere for a date night.  Cocktails are on point."}
{"text":"We went to Block & Grinder on Valentine's Day weekend. We had a reservation, so no problems getting seated. We ordered the pork belly pancakes as our appetizer and they were phenomenal. I'd go back just to have those again. I ordered the special cut and tiger prawns, which I highly recommend if it is ever offered as a special again. I can't wait to go back and try one of their burgers"}
{"text":"I get together regularly with a group of friends for dinner. With recommendations from a family member, we looked forward to a dinner at Block and Grinder.  Reading all the positive reviews about great wait staff but sadly that was not our experience.  Can't say enough good about bartender, friendly, prompt with nice wine and cocktail selection.   Wish we'd dine at the bar.   A tip to our waitress, Amy.  When something is wrong, apologize and fix it.  'It's wasn't my fault' really isn't the right response.  So, if you are a party of 4 dining on a Friday night, I'd recommend going elsewhere.  There are too many good restaurants that give good and consistent service."}
{"text":"save your money. fast food has better quality beef. their t-bone is totally missing the tender side of the cut. it is a rip off - and high priced. it is meant for people who do not understand what they are ordering or what they should receive."}
{"text":"The best Burger place in Charlotte! Without a doubt. Had a lamb Burger with feta cheese and curry aioli. AMAZING! Price is ok. A Burger cost somewhere around 15 dollars, but it is totaly worth it"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great bar! Tonight's drink special was a fresh peach moscow mule ....delicious! The beef is top quality and prepared and flavored perfectly to order. There are chicken and seafood entrees. There are also offerings of other meats such as bison, kangaroo on different nights. Small plates and appetizers are available also."}
{"text":"Always had great food and service here. I've dined here for brunch and dinner. Both were amazing. Everyone is always so friendly. Overall you just get a good vibe. Indoor and covered outdoor seating. They even have a deli case with lots of meats to take home for cooking. Order off the menu or ask what cuts of meat they have. The pork belly starter is a must. Hands down best pork belly of any place I've been to. They also have a full bar and delicious cocktail menu. Brunch has all the classic favorites. Just a solid choice for dinning out."}
{"text":"Solid food, especially for meat lovers. We've been here a few times (for dinner and brunch) and the staff has always been friendly and service was great. The burgers are solid, steak is solid, and the sides are all delicious. Sides are definitely large enough to share. The deviled eggs and pork belly as apps are also recommended.   One time, we made a reservation and realized after we arrived that it was for the Mooresville location, not this one. The GM was gracious enough to try and find us (party of 7) a spot to eat, despite being pretty booked. They could have easily said, \"sorry, no can do,\" but they didn't and were able to make it work.  Note, this location is not on OpenTable, but Mooresville is.  All in all, great food and service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've heard wonderful things about B&G and decided to stop by last night with the girls. We began dinner with a bottle of Montepulciano, a delightful, smooth red wine shared among the three of us, and a perfect complement to our meal.  Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating as we took our time catching up, drinking wine and browsing through the menu. We settled on the Pork Belly Pancakes, B&G Wild Game Chili and Beef Carpaccio as appetizers and this was definitely our favorite part of the meal! A lingering smoke followed my first bite of the pork belly and with the complement of a slight sweetness from slaw, made the perfect combination of originality and flavor. The Beef Carpaccio was thinly sliced, smeared with pesto sauce and sprinkled with greens and slices of parmesan while the chili provided the sweetest comfort on a cold, Fall day in November.  The same endearing waitress sold us on the burgers as she referenced the premium quality of meat that B&G provides and the tenderness yielded from being grounded in-house. I went with the \"Wild Game Burger\" and last night's selection was Elk! Though the presentation was beautiful and I loved how B&G was branded on the burger, the flavors were sub par. The last time I had elk, I fell completely in love with its tenderness and flavors. I think a lot of those flavors were lost when grounded. Nonetheless it was a decent burger, but I will opt for one of the chef's selections next time.  We ended the meal with house-made apple crumble and bread pudding. Both were delicious and I am a complete sucker for anything that is made in-house. The apple crumble was my favorite as the softness and warmth of the apples fit perfectly with the crunchy texture of the crumbs and the cold vanilla scoop of ice cream on top.  I will definitely be back to B&G to try more of the small plates and probably a steak or the duck confit next time!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the experience immensely...except for the wait, of course. We didn't have a reservation, so hung out at the bar and had drinks for about 45 minutes. We weren't in a hurry so it was fine, but if you want to sit immediately, make reservations...and make them well in advance.  On to the food (which - let's be real - is what we all care about). We ordered:  - Cheese & Charcuterie Plate: We went with the Fennel Salami, VSOP Gouda and the Mobay, all of which were yummy (the Fennel cheese is very Fennel-y so if you don't like Fennel...you've been warned). I will say that I felt their meats/cheeses were outrageously expensive (I compare them to what I can get at Good Food on Montford, which are similarly delicious and you get twice the goods for slightly more than what B&G's charging). I know, I know, quality over quantity...I just don't think I'm enough of a meat/cheese connoisseur to think what they're charging was worth it. That said, we still enjoyed them.  - The B&G Burger (their signature burger grind): I went pretty mainstream with my entrée choice, and was not disappointed...from the moment they sat that burger in front of me with its little \"B&G\" branded bun, I was a happy camper. Burger was cooked perfectly, bun was great, fires were great...it was great. Did I mention it was great?  - Sides of Pan Fried Corn, Brussels Sprouts, Mac & 3 Cheese: In my opinion, these were easily stars of the show. These aren't particularly inventive or crazy sides, you see them (in various forms) on lots of menus...but what set them apart was the execution. They were all just perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about how great each of them were...makes me desperately want to try to the rest of the sides. Could I get a meal of just sides? I kid, I kid...sort of...  I can't exactly remember what my boyfriend ordered...I think I was too enamored with my food to care. A steak or something that I'm sure was amazing.   Well done, B&G...well done. Slash the prices on your meats and cheeses, but otherwise, keep up the good work.  P.S. they have corkage ($15 fee, which in my book isn't horrible - but then I'm from L.A. so take it with a grain of salt)."}
{"text":"I kind of found out last minute that Block & Grinder was opening this past Monday and since I work in the area, the wife and I decided to stop in and give them a try after looking at their online menu.  We were very excited to see bone marrow and sweetbreads on their small plates list, as well as rabbit and wild game meatloaf on the entrees.  As usual, we ordered way too much food, but we usually skip dessert and we did just that tonight.  For starters, we both really enjoyed  the bone marrow.  The presentation of the bone marrow was perfect with 3 big cross cuts ready to be scooped out and spread on the accompanying toasted baguette.  We also took 3 charcuterie offerings to share.  The pork rillettes and a cured salami called Molisana really hit the spot, as both were packed with flavor.  We will certainly try some of the other cured meats in the future from the charcuterie offerings.  I may try the sweetbreads next time, but they are served Kentucky style here, meaning fried, which is not my preferred preparation.  On to the entrees, I chose the wild game meatloaf and the wife took the red fish, and we both split a side of herbed mushrooms.  The fish was cooked to perfection with crispy skin and the succotash & sweet corn cream were fresh and packed with flavor.  The only gripe that I had with my plate was the over abundance of bourbon BBQ sauce on my plate, as it took away from the meatloaf itself.  I would recommend asking for the sauce on the side.  The wild mushrooms were great and always a crowd pleaser in my book.  As previously mentioned, no dessert for us, as we were stuffed.  I did forget to mention the biscuits and awesome smokey sweet butter that is offered to every table in lieu of bread.  As well, there is a full bar with bar seating for food and drinks.  The wine, beer and cocktail menu is extensive and I was promised that there will be taps soon, but only bottled beer for now.  As for the rest of the menu, all kinds of steak cuts and burgers, salads and sandwiches with a fairly extensive lunch menu.  The service was a little shaky, as it was our server's first shift, but you could tell that the training and expectations are there for great service from the greeting at the door to the bartenders, servers and kitchen staff.  We shall return with friends."}
{"text":"Parents were in town for the week and decided to try Block and Grinder out. Really enjoyed when they had the butcher shop on Selwyn,  so already had a feeling it was going to be good.   We tried everything...started with the deviled eggs, pork belly, and the ribs. Deviled eggs were creamy, yet you had a nice crunch with the prosciutto. Pork belly pancakes were unreal!! Pork was cooked perfectly with a nice crunch and savory glaze. Could of sat there and eat those all day. Lets not forget the ribs, which fell right off the bone..couldn't believe we hadn't had the entrees yet!  Yes there is more...we got the wild game meatloaf and the shiitake and gruyere burger. Meatloaf was delicious...eating that with the mashed potatoe croquettes, which were crispy on the outside and smooth very flavorful on the inside. I couldn't have asked for a better steak burger....which brings me to my next point, once you go steak burger you can't go back. No more ground meat for this guy. Great meal!!   Ready to go back and try the rest...love the concept!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Block and Grinder was this past weekend and it was fantastic!  Our waiter was very attentive but not overly so, very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in offering suggestions (my boyfriend was torn between 3 different choices) and the food was just amazing. We started with the deviled eggs which were awesome.  My boyfriend decided on the venison flank steak (which was a special that night) and I had the duck.  Having never tried venison before (and being slightly hesistant to try it), Block and Grinder set the bar very high.  It was amazing.  And the duck with the warm peaches on the side was fantastic.  The portions were generous though neither of us had any trouble finishing our meals! :)  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was definitely a good choice! Yum!  We sat outside so I cannot comment on the indoor seating but it seemed totally fine.  It's trendy and not an \"intimate\" restaurant but we aren't typically looking for that type of setting.  It's a little louder and more casual while still being upscale. Their prices are VERY reasonable considering other restaurants in the area and the freshness and high quality of your meal.  I actually was suprised it wasn't more expensive given the level of service and ingredients. You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to food and the meals here are totally worth the price. Really looking forward to our next visit.  We saw so many amazing meals being delivered to neighboring tables so we cannot wait to go back and try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"I was there last week and I must say I had one the best Steaks of my life. It was a prime rib-eye and it was perfect. I also order a side of the pomme frits, equally fantastic. We just bought a place in Charlotte and will certainly make Block & Grinder a regular dinner choice. Can't forget, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here last night and wow! The burger I had (which was the B&G) was soo tasty! I tasted my friends steak and it melted in my mouth! It was sooo great! Also tasted the Mac and 3 cheese! It was divine! It was some of the best that I have had in a long time! The reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is cause I was not a fan of the fries... Just not my cup of tea. And I understand they only use what's in season but I really wanted some asparagus... And they didn't have any..."}
{"text":"Sub par. Spending $95-100 per person to fine dine at a steak house, this is my last choice. Would easily drive uptown to mortons or capital grille. Steak wasn't terrible but sides were pathetic. After ordering my ala carte side of pathetic garlic mash I had to wait while everyone else began their meal because they obviously got confused by my steak and potato order. Had to wait on mash pot. Lol. That can be confusing, I guess, when you don't care. And then the atmosphere. I walk in and it's lit up like a runway. Really? A high priced steakhouse with bright lights? Who's idea was this? Go to capital grille and take a look. This place will fade with the lake Norman crowd. There's 3 other great steakhouses in the lake Norman area that will destroy this place."}
{"text":"Great food but we had reservations and still had to wait 35 mins because they had a \"walkin\" rush. So apparently reservations don't matter. Then we sat at the bar and watched them comp drinks for people surrounding us since they were \"waiting on their reservations.\" We didn't get our drinks comped but whatever. The bartender had to wait our table because I guess understaffed? Who knows. Then, we got our food, my steak was extremely undercooked from what I asked, but still delicious. I give them 2 stars for their food quality but worst service I have had in a while. I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried it twice for lunch and each time I had great service and excellent food. Their steak is outstanding; it's as good as Del Frisco's. though the dining room and bar's ambiance can not hold a candle to Del Frisco's. Then again neither can their prices, which are about half of Charlotte's expensive steak houses. Make sure you order their fries, they are great. If you like a good cup of coffee their French press is excellent, be aware that excellence is more expensive than mediocrity. I look forward to trying out their bar one evening and experiencing some of those drinks the other \"Yelpers\" recommended.  This place will definitely be added to my go to places for good food. They really deserve four and a half stars."}
{"text":"I ordered a Veruca Salt cocktail. It was tasty, but nothing spectacular.   The burger was great, cooked perfectly with a nice roasted pepper spread. I have no idea why the small patty was served on a giant bun. I would have preferred a bun that was the same size as the burger. It seemed like the restaurant didn't want to go to the effort to have buns made for them.   The service was terrible. After my cocktail I stuck with water. I was empty so often that I eventually drank the water of my table mates.  Dessert wasn't offered at all.  I'm not going to rush back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wild boar chili and wine were good but Bison burger was small and over-cooked and roll was way too much bread for the burger. Combination was very dry. Fries were greasy and under-cooked. Overall, not good for the price."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to coming here since it opened. I had read about their burgers, but once we got there the ribs were calling me. I decided to get the ribs as an app and get the burger. I got the burger medium and it was perfectly cooked. I got it with the pimento cheese and bacon. The bun was extremely soft. The cheese was soft (obviously) and the meat was soft. It came out without bacon on it, which would have added the extra texture to break up the softness, but I was hungry and it wasn't worth mentioning it. Overall, it was delicious. My wife got the special which was a gumbo-like dirty rice. It had venison sausage in it that was a first for me. We are excited to go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Pretty legit!  We went opening night and the service and food were great! The sides were a bit small considering the price - I thought they would be more family size. My burger was cooked very nicely and the pommel frites were tasty as well as portioned well. I also had a side of Brussels that were good (if you don't like bacon or can't have pork you may need to ask for some cooked differently). My boyfriend had a strip that was very flavorful. The mashed potatoes were good, but small, and much colder than the rest of the meal. Dessert was something I'd never had before - basically their play on the ice cream sandwich.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and was happy, but not overwhelmed. The service with iPads was nifty, and the restaurant was immaculate with a good vibe. My burger was a bit small, and not that exciting. very good quality of the meat. The sides were unique. Will be back to finish off my gift card, but afterwards...."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service, we split a house cured pastrami sandwich and tried a few cocktails as well. Creative drink menu with specials of the day as well including the blackberry mojito. The sandwich was rich, almost too rich with buttered bread encasing house cured pastrami that was griddled before service.  Overall a great meal and would order again given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Good and bad, but the bad outweighed the good. haven't been back since and don't plan to unless someone invites and treats. service is subpar. we called to make reservation on Sat. night and they said they didn't take them, but the wait was 45 mins. we said ok, see you soon, planning on spending time at the bar. We were seated at the bar and excellent (but very pricey) cocktails. the bar tenders was chatty but pleasant. recommended some favorites and talked on and on about other stuff. at about 35 mins. in I checked with the (male) host and was told, \"I told you 45 mins and it's only been 35\", so I sat back at the bar to wait. after another 15-20 mins. i inquired again and was told he was under the impression we were eating at the bar, per the bartender. we said no, never said that and wanted a table. we were then sat a a two top in the back by the wall. our waiter referred to the as the \"time out\" table. We got up and decided to skip dinner and pick up burgers on the way home. as we walked outt he host said no problem, we could take a nice big booth by the window, so we decided to stay. after being seated the manager on duty stopped and said he heard about he miscommunication and offered to buy us some apps and another round of beverages. we both ordered some wine and they brought out pork belly and deviled eggs, which were off the charts delicious. then after a long wait our entree's came. i ordered the bar tender recommended game meatloaf and it was burnt. dried out and burnt. then my wife got a burger and it was small and overdone. we ended up leaving without finishing our drinks or entrees. and, at one point when i was checking our table, i overheard a lady (ex-judge) recommend to the host they should handle this (didn't know what at time) before they got sued. later when walking to our table the floors where slick as ice and i had to support my wife to make sure she didn't slip and break something. we later assumed that was the judge's warning. Not sure if host is the same, or the cooks are any better but a few good apps and a couple over price (but tasty) cocktails don't compensate for all the missteps. The place is small and cramped. Maybe they worked out some early bugs but my first experience did not leave a good impression and i've been back since. If you do, make sure you don't get seated at the time-out table and send back food that's burnt or not cooked well."}
{"text":"The food & the service were great!   Amazing Manhattans, pork belly, deviled eggs, steak, and roast.  Everyone loved their meals.  We had a party of four and had great service -- but the restaurant was not too busy.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really worth trying if you haven't already.  A great combination of inspired menu and semi casual atmosphere.  I enjoyed my experience overall but some of the details were lacking.  Had the duck confit and it was amazing - great flavor balance and perfectly rendered but the mushroom stuffing served with it was way over salty.  My guest got the prime filet ( great price as a special) and it was good,  unfortunately like a traditional steak house they sell sides separately from the steak entrees and this is where the chef really missed the mark- disappointing that they don't complement the entrees better.  Besides that,  it was a fun and delicious experience."}
{"text":"Small quaint restaurant with wine room and butcher shop inside. Their burgers with truffle fries are really good with buttered buns. Their sides are good as well"}
{"text":"Bill the Butcher welcomes you.  Paying homage to Mr. William Cutting, so lovingly portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York, is a tradition among bar patrons that I will start next time I visit.   The venue is best appreciated while empty on a sunny late afternoon. Sun blasts over the catholic church and glistens on bald heads. The staff is unfettered,  attentive even. Tables and consciences are clean.   You may have to ask the waitstaff to keep the blinds up and sit at a table with your back to the butcher counter to appreciate this sunny vista.  This place is a specialty. Block & Grinder stands up in positive fashion for taste and quality of food, decor, creativity of menu and personality of servers and staff. Not a party scene, not inexpensive. I have difficulty answering Yelp's survey questions about this place.  For a cocktail, I had the Chupacabra. \"Goat sucker.\" A mythical Mexican monster strewn about '90s vernacular from an X-Files episode - this was a green concoction of vodka, passion fruit, Anaheim pepper syrup and lemon.  A bit spicier than I like. The heat from the pepper in my throat kept me from drinking fast. Stayed sober, never had the next drink I had in mind.  The Pork Belly is something delicious. On very thin pancakes. I preferred the belly without the pancakes. Tender and succulent, it was. No need for pancakes.  For a quality sharing plate, order some charcuterie. I chose Proscuitto di Parma & Wild Ass Boar Sopresatta with two accompanying cheeses. It's a good bet to ask the server which cheeses go with whatever meats you are having.   We had the Cana de Cabra (yes, that's two items in this review with \"cabra\" in them, which means \"goat\" in Spanish) and one of the Goudas. Both fantastic. The proscuitto was top notch, rhythmic goodness. Their Wild Boar Sopresatta comes in thick slices of tasteful explosiveness and is similar to chorizo or pepperoni   The two benefactors accompanying me ate the Deviled Eggs, of which I have zero interest. Asked where they ranked on their list of all-time greatest deviled eggs, both men gestured positively.  My suggestions are to let them do what a butcher does best: meat, cheese and cocktails."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying they have a great local beer selection. Both I tasted were great suggestions...I will add them to my list...  We started with the lamb lollypops and they were delicious! I had the Braised Short Ribs and my date had the venison chili. My dish was perfect in taste and temperature. Kenneth's not so much but it was so good he didn't want to send it back!    The servers are attentive and the atmosphere is peaceful. It was so quiet I didn't even realize there was a television on at the bar area. I enjoy an atmosphere where I can actually hear the others at my table...  I will be back, this is now on my favorites in Charlotte list."}
{"text":"Awesome menu!!! I had the lamb burger w a side of spinach. All of the steaks and other entrees looked good too"}
{"text":"Came on a busy Friday night... Didn't have reservations but got seated on the porch within 10 minutes. Great outside atmosphere in the front of the restaurant, which is hidden in a shopping center on Providence Rd.   Waiter was great - ran through specials like a boss. We opted to split a Caesar salad, just enough without ruining the meal which was out right afterword.   You can dress up your burgers anyway you like. Burgers are small in size but big on taste. NY Cheddar + Bacon = Burger Lover Delight. Every additional topping you add to a plain burger it will cost you but it's worth it. My burger was $20.   Great fries that come with the burger and an extensive drink list. Cool thought that this place is also an operating butcher shop - so if you want to take a cut back to grill on your own, you can.   Couldn't get myself up to the challenge of ordering a Camel steak which was one of the night's specials. I'll go back on Hump Day."}
{"text":"So B & G has been open about 1.5 years now and even though my favorite bartender in Charlotte, Kyle, no longer runs the fantastic little bar, I'm a huge fan.  We go way back; won their summertime cocktail contest and my husband came in second. I also like to pick up steak or slab bacon (rare find in this city) while I'm there because the restaurant is also a butcher shop.  Anyway, to the food. The menu changes seasonally and they get what they can from local farms, etc. Everything is just so thought through by Chef Ben from start to finish. The most recent visit was on one of their first nights with the fall/winter menu. We started with the bone marrow that's served with a great gremolata type spread/sauce. Killer stuff. My sister, who lives in L.A. and is a chef might I add, shared the wedge salad which is a deconstructed salad with butter lettuce in lieu of iceberg. Next....the big guns. I got the smoked pork cheeks which was one of the yummiest and most satisfying meals I've had in awhile. Highly recommend that. My husband got the always delish trout and my sister got the duck. I'm typically not a big duck fan but this was so succulent and my sister said \"best duck I've ever had\".  Just go. Just go already! Also, wine by the glass is half off on Monday. Not sure if bottles are half off.... Plus, we had a server we'd never had before. Actually everyone in there on Monday was new to me. Savvas was our server and he was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fantastic cocktails, average food. We were disappointed there were no side dishes served with the meat, and there was nothing exceptional about the taste either. Plus, the dessert menu needs some help. Overall for the cost and lackluster experience, I probably would not return here."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in Charlotte. I witnessed various appalling health code violations and the food is sub par at best. It tries to be chic with its butcher/restaurant concept but wholeheartedly fails at both. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Pork Belly appetizer was to die for!  A little more pork belly a little less garnish :)  Mixed Greens could use a little love - there is a sprinkling of oil & it is literally leaves on a plate.  Shitake & Gruyere burger so rich & it was as if you could taste the difference in it being local.  This will become one of my new standards."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch at B&G! Both good atmosphere and good service.  My wife had the Barbecue Sandwich and fries, which were both very good. She said she would get it again. Also, it was a Thursday and that particular item was 1/2 price, which made it taste even better...  I had the BLT which just went on their seasonal menu. Great bacon, heirloom tomatoes, and bread choice. My only critique is that there was a bit too much tomato, overpowering the other elements and making it difficult to eat. The real treat was the pan-fried corn substituted on the side. I heard people rave about it, and it is legit. I could probably have eaten just this and been satisfied!"}
{"text":"Coming up to my first swanky upscale experience in Charlotte, I was excited that it was B&G as I heard it was amazing. It's smaller than life restaurant makes for a very nice ambiance as it's not too loud but slightly crowded. As per my thoughts:  The Décor 5/5: - Very clean, slightly modern with a bunch of hominess. The small space give it a warm feel that counteracts the slightly upscale feel you get when looking at the menu. It's a very clever way of designing the restaurant to a point where you might not want to leave for a bit.  The Service 5/5: Really good service, to a point where I didn't expect it to be that good. It reminded me a lot of what service was like at the high end restaurants in Vegas. Explained the menu very well and articulated the special of the day (venison) with ghusto that pretty much made me want them to \"just take my money\". Refilled out glasses with water consistently, food came out at a good time, and kept asking me if I wanted more alcohol (like that should be a question)...  The Meal 3.5/5: Honestly, the food came up short. The beer selection was great, the wine not so much. I got the special which was the venison with some greens which turned out OKAY. The venison was cooked just the way I liked it, but it lacked a good amount of sauce which I like. The greens weren't bad, but the deserts (we practically ordered half of them) were all very good. The short ribs (which I tried from my cousin) were downright amazing, so i'll definitely come back for those.  Overall I'll come back here again to try their other signature dishes. They seem to have a well balanced menu and It's definitely worth it to taste a bit of everything."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Come here often.  One of the best Moscow Mules in town.   Get the game burger you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I thought it was average. 3 stars is generous enough. Best part of the meal were pork belly appetizer and the local craft beer selection. My oork chop was dry/overcooked and stuffing bland. However my son thought the fried chicken confit was awesome. My mother in law ordered a burger cooked medium that came uncooked. Not every rare. Waiter was gone for ten minutes. When they took it back they simply threw the smashed burger back in the grill and returned it on the same plate. Real tacky. Did not care that they still charged but definitely  not a place to go for customer service. My other son had the New York strip which was not as good as expected. For the price you would expect BLT quality steaks (Ritz-Carlton). Fries were average. Saw in local paper they were ranked best in Charlotte. I would say worst LOL. Anyway, a hell of lot better places to eat in Charlotte. Do not waste your money on this high priced mediocre eatery."}
{"text":"So YUM. We got there right when it opened on Sunday and were the first people seated (it quickly filled up though). The service was excellent and we were well taken care of. I'm not sure what beans they use for their french press...but it was  the best I've ever had. I had the basic breakfast which was yummy and filling. My husband had the duck bowl and he loved it."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte and awesome bar. Lake Norman just got a gem in this place @ Langtree. Chef Ben and Chef Ethan rule"}
{"text":"I really wasn't expecting much of Block & Grinder when I was decided to stop by for dinner to be honest, but they really blew me away.  I was a bit early for my dinner date and decided to wait at my table instead of sitting at the bar. When my waiter came around he asked if I'd like to wait before ordering drinks or if I'd like one ahead of time. How considerate. Finally my fellow diner arrived and we got some nifty drink recommendations from our waiter who also happened to be the bar manager. He really knows his stuff and actually made some of the cocktails on the menu! I'll have to visit and try more sometime.  Libations taken care of we decided to order some foie gras and roasted bone marrow to start with. The foie gras was beautifully presented! The only problem I had with this was that it was a very sweet dish overall with the buttered soldier on the bottom soaking up all that port reduction. Thankfully the charred nature of the foie gras helped tone it down a bit. The bone marrow was a big hit, the luxurious fatty marrow was served with a generous topping of arugula pesto to help cut the richness. While the foie gras had the problem of being too salty this one had the unfortunate problem of being a bit too salty so had to be topped sparingly on our bread though they did an excellent job of tempering the funk that can sometimes be associated with marrow bones.  For the main course I was recommended the rack of lamb with wild ramps and a mushroom farro which I was leaning towards over the short rib. I am glad I did, I loved it! It was nicely presented and when our waiter had heard that I am a big fan of ramps he had asked the kitchen to have some extra ramps added to the dish for me! My lamb was perfectly cooked how I asked for it (medium rare) and in contrast to the appetizers perfectly seasoned. Usually I'll take a bite then give an opinion. In this instance I just took a bite and smiled enjoying the food. All the flavors in this dish worked well together with the tomato gastrique brightening up the earthiness of the mushroom farro and the ramps' stringent onion flavors adding complexity to the bites of lamb.  For dessert my dining companion opted for a glass of champagne while I opted out. However our thoughtful waiter brought out some ginger ale in a champagne glass so I didn't just awkwardly sit there. If I had to judge them solely on their food it would probably be 4 stars however the service here really bumped it up a notch. Thanks for the excellent dinner Block and Grinder!"}
{"text":"This place OMG, love you forever Block and Grinder! I grew up in a co op farm community. Now I work in community service begging for veggies and playing chef every week at The Community Cafe. All for free. :) My life revolves around food. I have to say eating at B&G was an absolute time warp treat. The adult in me was completely satisfied, but that kid who grew up farming was ecstatic. I've never left a meal so happy. From my field green salad and venison burger to my unreal espresso creme brulee. I was just done. :)"}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to trying this place after a recommendation from a friend and looking over the menu but after the conversation I just had on the phone with them I don't think I will ever be stepping foot in this establishment. While trying to make reservations for I decent sized party I was first told that the time I wanted on a Saturday night would take up 30% of their tables we could be accommodated after 9:00.  When I questioned the logic of a guaranteed party I was told that reservation was just not available. I don't think it was the fact that we couldn't get a table as much as the way Robert (I believe) really didn't care at all if my party and I ever walked into the restaurant."}

Cheerwine BBQ Sauce is the BEST BBQ Sauce I have Eaten!!!  EXCELLENT ! !! !!!  Green Slaw was good, Needs work!!!  Pear Dessert was OK, needs Much work, start over or skip Dessert!"}
{"text":"Food perfection. The staff and kitchen love food and know they have people coming in who love food. It's just damn good food! Go there and thank me later!"}
{"text":"I had expected the meat to be good, but vegetables were also excellent. Even the bits of meat in the veg (usually good for flavor, but tough/ fatty themselves) were excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but not amazing. I love to try new places so was excited to get to B&G but probably won't return anytime soon. Nothing was bad, it just wasn't that great. I ordered the Cajun Bison Burger which was pretty good and the perfect size, but found it super silly that add ons were a few bucks each. It's already a $16 burger, so to add cheese, mushrooms, fried egg, etc was $2-$3 each item. Pretty much everyone has burgers as well and everyone enjoyed thier meals.   Our service was great (wish I could remember his name) and we had a reservation so no wait to get a table made things very nice.   I'd say if you're looking to try a new place and are a meat eater, definitelyrics give B&G a try. Just be open minded and willing to spend a few bucks."}
{"text":"My husband and I live very close and have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Block & Grinder.  We tried it for the first time Friday night and went again today for Easter Sunday brunch.  We loved everything.  Friday night dinner - we got there around 6:30 and that seemed a good idea because it started to get very busy shortly after we were seated.  He had the mint julep; I had the gin basil smash.  We've been looking for craft cocktails like that since we moved here this fall from Portland, OR!  Found!  We each had the wedge salad.  There didn't seem to be much difference in size between his full and my half, but oh well.  The bacon in it was enough to make up for that.  Wow.  I had the NY strip; he had the pork chop and we shared asparagus (a little rich in oil for us, but that's just preference).  We shared a bottle of wine too.  I don't remember the name but Franklin (our server both times) let us try a few before we committed.  Very nice.  Brunch today didn't disappoint.  Fresh squeezed OJ!  I had the french toast with a side of that can't be skipped bacon.  He had the corned beef hash.  Both we amazing.    We've found the service very helpful and friendly.  They even brought out additional asparagus when Chef saw our serving and didn't think it was enough (we never would have known).  This will be our new hang, for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Block and Grinder for my birthday and what a treat it was! Ther service was impeccable, the food was delicious, the portions were large and the ambiance was marvelous. I started with the fried green tomato salad. It tasted so fresh. My boyfriend started with the caprese which was equally as good. I had the short ribs -- they were perfectly flaky, tender and tasted so good that I forced myself to save some for breakfast the next morning. My boyfriend had the filet and there wasn't a piece left on his plate. Definitely go here! It is one of the best places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"*Rating only on food* Where to start. I guess I'll start with the good, then the bad as sadly there was some things that stood out that irked the party as well as came off a little \"odd.\"  For appetizers: We ordered the Pork Belly, Deviled Eggs, and the Jumbalaya. It was all delicious, however the only question was on the deviled eggs was served on some wine menus. Is that to soak up water or something? Maybe it was to hint to get some wine? I've always known that whatever you place on the dish should be edible. (Maybe they didn't get the memo) My best guess is that is so it doesn't slide off the dish, but still there has to be a more creative solution...  The Jumbalaya was the winner in the appetizer choices though. It had flavor and a little kick at the end to top it all off.   Entreé: I ordered the 22 Oz ribeye steak. Oscar style. (Which meant that there was crab meat on top) Was it good? Yep. Do I suggest you to get it? Yes, only if you brought a big appetite with you because that was one pretty big ribeye. But of course, I finished it.  Sides that you have to try out are the mac and cheese. Those are amazing.  Now to the bad: Our waiter's name was Amy...and well some things went down before my brother and I got there and some things after I arrived. My party told me when I arrived about 20 minutes late that the waiter came up twice about when we were getting there. First telling my party that at 7:30 there was another table coming and that the whole party wasn't here. Second time complaining about when we were coming.   Now when both of us came, I observed she was very touchy and feely. She caressed my mother's arm and then proceeded to ask her if she shaved her arms, and then went to my father and caressed his arm... what the fuck?  Anyways, I saw her come back and then apologize for rushing us to order and the previous comments, however this was after we ordered $200+ worth of food. (I think she wanted to make sure she had a tip at the end.) She continued to say that management was rushing her. (Way to blame it on the people who hired you..)  She constantly made weird comments throughout the night. Such as: \"I got this cake from that table, because they wanted to give it to me.\" Or how about taking a customer's baby and then proceeding to introduce the baby to other tables...   Let's just say, this restaurant is not a family restaurant. I'm pretty sure that's not the ambiance that they are going for. It's a pretty high class steakhouse...With some feelings from my party of being judged of not having enough money to pay for the meal to just weird comments or inappropriate touching of customers...It changes the experience.  But, if I was to solely judge the food. It's definitely a place to go eat, I definitely will be back again...but I'll ask not to get this waiter again, or else I'll switch tables. I know this is a 5 star restaurant in my books, but you know what they say, when the service is off the food will feel a little off as well."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by the drinks or food. The appetizers are delicious and have amazing flavor. The pork belly is cooked perfectly and the deviled eggs have a perfect twist. All of the mixed drinks are made with care. The bartenders truly know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"So I've been to Block and Grinder 3 times now and each time I have such high hopes  only to be disappointed once again. I love the location. I love the concept. The food is so so and the service horrible.   The first time was with another couple. There were 4 of us. The bar service was stupid slow and none of finished our dinners. No one asked us what's wrong or if we liked our meal and it took them 20 min to bring our check.   The second time I went with 6 women. Again the bar service was slow. The bartender focused on chatting it up with a waitress instead of bringing us drinks. Then he looked at us strange when asked for a second drink, almost like we bothering him.   The third and let's note, my final, was New Year's Eve. We chose it because it was in our neighborhood and we could get a large party home with one driver and a minivan. The sat us an hour late, then one waiter for 15 people. The restaurant was not busy but no one helped our waiter with us until I asked the second bartender for some more water. He jumped in to get us more drinks and was super nice. The manager chatted it up the wait staffs in the kitchen area, 3 people stood in the kitchen area chatting while 2 guys worked.  Then to make matters worse they hadn't brought us the check but started turning up the lights in the restaurant because they close at 10. Let's note they didn't seat us until 9.   I don't recommend. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"My parents were in town for Easter weekend, but being new (ish) to the area I didn't know where to take them. I asked around the office and someone suggested The Liberty, but while looking up The Liberty on Yelp I found Block & Grinder... And I'm so glad I did!  After seeing reviews and pictures on Yelp we started with the pork belly pancakes. My sister and I are both super picky and we enjoyed these!  Four of the five of us got burgers (two regular and two specials which was elk) and they were fantastic. Very big. My mom got a fried chicken which was fantastic. It's not your typical, super heavy fried chicken dish. Highly recommend.   Although we were stuffed, we got the ice cream sundae and bread pudding. So good.  As we left my boyfriend turned to me and said, \"I think this is the best restaurant we've eaten at since moving.\" We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good food... Very Pricey.  I had the burger which was very good but it was like $20 which is too much for a burger in my opinion.  Also had the Pork Belly which was amazing and only cost $10... Go figure!  I will be back but unfortunately this place is too expensive to go all the time.  The best way to describe this place is that you are paying the prices of an fancy restaurant and getting the ambiance of a local cafe.  I would argue that many of the dishes including the duck breast, are in fact incredible and creative but just seemed overpriced for the overall dining experience.  That being said I definitely would recommend trying once(GET THE PORK BELLY) and seeing if the overall experience is worth the price."}
{"text":"First visit, large group, not really impressed. Burger (by itself) is okay. Little salty and kind of on the small side, for me at least. the add ons- sweet and smoky bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, quail egg, mellow out the seasoning to make this a savory treat. Great yet pricey small plates. Lamb lollipops, charcuterie board, cheese board, marrow and good bourbon(s).  Second time around. smaller group, better.  The seared duck breast, OUTSTANDING, Perfectly seared and crisp skin and a medium cook temp was tender and juicy. Sides of buttery asparagus, bacony brussel sprouts, rich and creamy mac and cheese and fresh cut pomme frit.   N.Y strip, salty but, also good and meaty.   Great local beers and a beautiful wine list. Great specials make it hard to try the standard menu. Pricey but, worth a one off. Gets crowded quick.  Staff is attentive.   IMO, skip the season salt, with meat this good it's masking the true flavor.  Yeah, i'll be back.  Hopefully Elk will be on the menu again."}
{"text":"The cinnamon bun was the best that I've ever had! I ordered chicken and waffles which was also superb. The chicken was so perfectly fried, and it was all off the bone tender. I didn't even know that texture was possible with fried chicken! Our server Jarett was very personable and friendly. I would definitely brunch here again!"}
{"text":"Not much to say to this review....Soggy, too much butter, spoiled/wilted salad, over salted n yucky fries.....and the Cuban sandwich, so not a Cuban. Also ordered the pastrami- greasy bread (NO) and the meat was soo fatty.  This was a to go order....I ordered it when I got there & I live right around the corner. The service was wonderful! Plus when talking to Jed after getting home to just disappointment. He was more than happy to refund me for the whole order.  Thank you much Jed!!!"}
{"text":"We started out with the deviled eggs and a charcuterie with prosciutto, wild boar soppressata and pimento cheese. All were very good and not too heavy to start a meal with.   My husband and I shared the rib eye stake which came out cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. We love a good steak and were very pleased.   Our friends had the filet and a lam burger which they both enjoyed.   This was a great find in Charlotte, we really enjoyed it and our server was exceptional."}
{"text":"Have wanted to check this place out for a long time - so glad we did!   We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar - very cordial service, good wine and beer selection. We were quickly seated in the dining room - cool vibe, fairly small, lots of noise but a great view of the kitchen.  We started with three appetizers - deviled eggs, the scallops and an order of the fois gras. All three were good, but the deviled eggs were a step above, with the goat cheese giving them a tart creaminess.  For dinner we had the halibut special with mushroom risotto and the game burger special, kangaroo. Both were excellent - well prepared, generous portions and tasty! Apparently I like kangaroo meat, who knew!  Overall this place is similar to Roosters, which is a very good thing! I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Block&Grinder is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I have never had a bad meal here. I am biased to the providence location since the original.  Try the Pork Belly, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"I went in super excited about grass fed beef! Lol this place is rude! The waitress was slack, she left us feeling abandoned! The food was extremely disappointing again! The burger was $15 and $3 more to add anything to it... For $18 it shouldn't look like a kids meal!  The regular fries were under cooked and greasy. I sent my burnt sweet potato fries back and got a  snotty reply from the chief sent out \"they were charred\" lol charred would have soft fluffy potato inside not about to break my teeth! The steak was ok but again way overpriced the quality is not there! This was my second time trying to eat here both very unpleasant!  Our food did not look like the pictures showed!"}
{"text":"I'd tried to go to B&G for dinner, but there was always a really long wait, so a girlfriend and I decided to try at 4:00 p.m. on a Friday.  Success!  We were almost so early that the staff was unclear why we were there.  Late lunch, ma'am?  Nope, drinks and dinner!  The atmosphere is very modern with light wood and metal, but it's somehow still very cozy.  It's packed a lot into a small space - butcher shop, wine shop, restaurant and bar.  The bar is small but has an open feel with all kinds of beautifully colored glass bottles against the window.  One small suggestion to make the bar perfect?  Add purse hooks (my new personal crusade for every bar).  We sat at the bar, and I got a boring ol' gin and tonic, but my friend got a creative basil concoction that was inventive and refreshing.  The basil was so fresh there were a bee on it.  Talk about farm to table!  The three bartenders who waited on us were friendly and funny, and they had great food and drink suggestions.   For dinner, friend got the pimento burger ($12), and I got two appetizers - pork belly ($8.50) and bone marrow ($7) - a meat smorgasbord!  The burger was one of my top five in Charlotte.  The pork belly was wrapped in corn bread pancakes, so it was like a pork belly taco.  I perhaps took too long to eat them because the first one was awesome and the third one had sat in the bourbon and sorghum glaze too long and had gotten sticky and messy.  I had never had bone marrow before, but I loved the presentation - we actually had to scoop the marrow out of three bones.  (Vegetarians need not apply here!).  The bread/crackers it came with were a little salty for my taste, so it was hard to get the full marrow flavor.  I'm glad I gave this place a second attempt.  I always love it when a restaurant takes reservations, but I guess right now they don't need to.  Get there early and come hungry for a cornucopia of meat!"}
{"text":"Great great spot.  The steaks are probably some of the best in Charlotte for sure.  The appetizers were so good, we all joked that we should just keep ordering starters and forget entrees.  Vibe is cool, and service was spot on.  Drinks were also very good and unique.  The Ginger Basil Smash was awesome. (I think that is the name)."}
{"text":"This restaurant and butcher prides itself on farm to table ingredients and all natural, organic meats and wild game. The service is good. Their specialty is meat and they know how to cook it really well -- however you like it! The Pork Belly Small Plate (pork belly cubes glazed in a bourbon and sorghum sauce on top of cornmeal pancakes) is a MUST have appetizer to start your night off! They are also known for their delicious deviled eggs. In terms of entrees, I really like their duck (the reason my rating isn't 5 stars is because I find their duck a bit more fatty than I would like) and their pork chop is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The bone marrow was a very interesting appetizer that I am glad I got. The New York strip and spare ribs were some of the best I have ever had. I will be going back here often."}
{"text":"I have been to Block and Grinder a few times before but have never been as satisfied as I have been with its food and service as my most recent visit.  We were seated quickly on a Friday night without reservations. Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and helpful with suggestions for food and drink.    We started off with the pork belly, which I would recommend everyone who visits order.  The pork was so tender and just oozing with flavor (just thinking of it now is making me salivate). It was accompanied with slaw and pancakes, which were very good as well.  My husband and I were also very impressed by the portion that was served for the price.    For my main course, I had the hanger steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  After having a not-so-well cooked steak at a mediocre chain restaurant the week before, this is exactly what I needed to finally satisfy my steak craving.  My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy, and well-seasoned.  No complaints about the arugula salad or potatoes either.    The star of the whole night for me actually sat on my husband's plate.  He ordered the pork chop with brussel sprouts and bone marrow bread pudding.  Yes, the pork chop was delicious, but oh my goodness... the bone marrow bread pudding?  Amazing.  It's essentially stuffing, and while this seems so basic, it was so so good!  I could not help but go back for a third and fourth taste.  I was too full for dessert, but I will definitely be back soon to try the butterscotch pot de creme.  I did indulge in a cocktail my waitress recommended, the Kentucky Corpse Reviver.  She described it as \"interesting but in a good way\", and after taking a sip, I knew what she meant.  Unique in its blend of flavors but very fresh and citrusy.    Chef Ben also came to ask us about our meal.  After I raved over his food, he shared that the simple trick to their recipes was simply using great local ingredients.  All in all, I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"\"Oui, chef. One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.\" -- Ratatouille (2007)  I make a lot of business trips to Charlotte and I'm always looking for a great meal. My boss brought me here almost a year ago and we enjoyed it so much that when a coworker and I were back in town we opted to come back.  We had no reservation this time, so when we stepped into the restaurant, which was empty at 7pm, the hostess asked us if we had a reservation. I told her no and she gave me a look like there was no way they could accommodate us. Ummm, what? She looked around and saw the same thing I did - an empty restaurant. She begrudgingly sat us as a 4-top table, with little favor. Ok, sure.  Our waitress came over quickly and asked for drink orders - neither of us wanted to drink as it had been one of those days where we just wanted yummy food and then to go crash back at the hotel.  We discussed with her the charcuterie plate first and then she asked if we wanted to go ahead and place our entree order.  So we did.  I opted for the filet - I got the ribeye last time and while it was delicious, my friends filets looked better. And since I really wanted something starchy, I got 2 sides - the garlic mash and the spinach - a trade off. My coworker also ordered a filet and he got the 3-cheese mac and cheese.  After a time, our steaks came out... but no charcuterie. Weird. So when the server came back by, we asked to make sure it was not on the bill. She politely told us we never ordered one. Okay, sure. She won't be winning any server awards.   The food was delightful - my steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, as I ordered (I was worried after the charcuterie debacle). The spinach was my favorite side of the 3 at the table, with the mac and cheese a very close runner up. I love a great sauteed spinach and this one still had some integrity - not overly wilted - and with some good flavor. The mac and cheese had a good crispy texture from the topping and was not overly cheesy so that you felt ill afterward. The mashed potatoes were good, but no different than anywhere else.  We decided to get desserts since we were denied an appetizer - I can rarely pass up a creme brulee, but I probably should have this time around. It was touted as Dark Chocolate, but it was weak in chocolate flavor - kind of flat. It needed a serious punch to be able to carry the name Dark Chocolate. My coworker ordered the Apple Crumble which had much more flavor and creativity in the dessert.  Overall, I do recommend B&G. The food is great, but this trip the service was lacking and the dessert was a disappointment for me. But that won't keep me from going back."}
{"text":"The best short rib sandwiches in town. Server was knowledgable, prompt, attentive and a real nice guy. Suggested the BLT since we're near the end of season for tomatoes but we came for the short rib. If you've not had it, you've not lived! It's that good. They have their own butcher shop that looks outstanding. Will try that on our next visit. Among the many choices in this part of the Queen City, this ranks in the top five."}
{"text":"Farm fresh, local food, butcher shop, craft cocktails?? Seriously. Would I lie to you? This place was fun and the food was delicious! I'm totally pleased with the crowd and the ambience. Don't go here for a romantic tete-a-tete. Four of us went out on a Saturday night and managed to grab a high-top by the bar while we waited for a table. Sadly, we didn't know that we would have to get up & go to the bar to order our drinks... Alas, after ordering, the bartender did bring the drinks to us!   Dinner was delicious. We ordered a few appetizers to share - they all were good. Our server was nice but an over-sharer who probably dropped a little too much profanity while she was hanging out by our table. She was nice but we were here to actually hang out with each other, not our waitress.   I would definitely go back. This place had a good vibe and food was good. Love the close proximity to my house! Bonus.  :-)"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I have to agree with the other reviewer: BEST RESTAURANT IN CHARLOTTE! We have been here three times and everything I have had has been great. My husband is more adventurous than I am and has tried the camel steak and the boar steak. Both he absolutely loved. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing dinner!  Filet with gorgonzola cheese was amazing! Everything was awesome! Great wine selection! We had a pretty large group, sp we tried several appetizers and everything was great. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Coffee is 5 dollars and a glass of orange juice was 3 dollars. Just way too much. I don't mind paying for an entree but the drinks were too expensive. Orange Juice, Coffee, and the Duck Hash was 32 dollars plus tip. I want to give 4 stars for the duck hash but I've gotten way better food/service for the same price.   The service was decent but nothing i would call attentive.   The duck hash was really tasty, I ordered a cup of hollandaise to go with it, but if I come here next time I'll just get some extra duck eggs on top. Definitely one of the unique brunch dishes in Charlotte. I really enjoyed it.   I worry about seeing all the spirits on the windows at the bar? It makes for a nice image but i wonder how much liquor enjoys UV rays."}
{"text":"Have stopped in here 3 times and have been bowled over each time.  It is a small restaurant with a small bar - but the place feels 'just right'.  The staff is super friendly and nice.  Bartenders are professional and have fantastic drinks - looove the Dark and Stormy!  I have had the meatloaf, charcuterie platter, brussel sprouts, chicken and various other items.  Everything was absolutely great and you WILL pay a bit more for it but it is worth it.    The best thing I can't get over and this probably sounds so weird - is the brussel sprouts.  I get them everywhere but they are the best I have ever had here.  Blanched lightly with a light sauce and served with bacon I think.  I ate almost the entire side by myself.  It was out of this world!!!    Will definitely be back - love the service and the option to buy meat-to-go for the fridge.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Extremely attentive and knowledgable service.   This place is our go-to Charlotte restaurants. With their recipes clean and simple, highlighting the quality of their ingredients and culinary skills.   BRUNCH:  Brunch here is our favorite yet, in a city known for numerous delicious brunch spots.   Their chicken confit and waffles takes it to a new level. Who needs battered and fried chicken when you have such savory delicious tenderness in this chicken confit? To the bone. Yes. I will gnaw down to the bone. You won't miss the fry batter!  Duck hash with duck confit and duck egg. Hoo boy! Here's another fave! Beautifully balances with flavor galore. But again, surprisingly simple in spice and not overwhelming. Block and Grinder's portions are made for quality, not quantity, but filling nonetheless.  Steak and eggs is the best I've had yet in Charlotte. With a marinade that does NOT distract from the quality of meat. Most places I've come across has marinaded their meat so strongly, that you don't appreciate the steak.   Biscuits and gravy. Well. I must say, don't expect a weak milk gravy at Block and Grinder. This one is made with their in-house breakfast sausage. Which is why I HAD to try it. I thought it was delicious. Heavy and hearty for sure! As any gravy should be. But many places rely on cheaply made gravy, focusing mostly on milk and flour, leaving nothing for the tastebuds to enjoy. This gravy, however, is certainly a meal in itself that leaves you more than satisfied. It's pricier than most nix biscuit and gravy entrees I've seen elsewhere, but you can also see why! Toasty biscuits and homemade sausage for the win!  LUNCH/DINNER:  If you're gonna spend on a rib-eye, have it done right at block and grinder. They know their meats well enough to know how to make them right. The perfect char on the edges, cooked to your heart's perfection.   Mac & Cheese - this might be the best Mac & Cheese I've ever had. Anywhere. Ever. I felt that way about it last year. I still feel that way about it this year. The texture. The flavors. Everything.   Well, now I'm hungry. Even though I'm still full from breakfast there. All I can think of now, is having dinner there."}
{"text":"Had my first visit last evening.  Went with a classic cheeseburger with bacon given the reviews I had read- this was VERY good.  The burger was quality meat and you could easily tell that it was fresh ground on premises. The bacon was incredible. thick cut and cooked to perfection. decent beer and wine menu.  I wish the bar area and restaurant itself was larger, but other than that this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've always gone for lunch to this place and I've loved it! Last week we went for dinner and I have to say it wasn't up to par, I might need to go again for good measure though :)  Went on a Saturday night and it was packed. There were lots of reservations but also lots of walkups, so the place was in the weeds. Though the service was good, the servers were a little too busy for my taste (ie: waters went unfilled for a while).   Cocktails were good and they have a good selection of wines by the glass. All of the food was good, but it lacked some quality and execution. The pork belly was extremely good, but there were a couple of pieces that were all fat - not good. The tartare had good flavors and a nice presentation, but it was pre-made so the meat was brown until you got to the very center... and we got a few crostini that were over toasted so it gave a bitter flavor to the dish. The meats were spot-on good! Cooked to perfection and of very good choice quality, there were no complaints there. My favorite side, the bone marrow, was also on point.   The desserts were ok, nothing to write home about... the ice cream side had the best flavor and texture, the bread pudding was a little dry and hard for my liking."}
{"text":"Block & Grinder is a cute little place with a great concept. I love that they focus on farm-to-table foods (they grind their own meat, so hello medium rare burger) and really enjoyed looking through their extensive wine, beer, and cocktail lists. They might still be working out a few kinks, or our waiter might have just been a little wacky, but there was some general confusion. Overall, the food was good, but I would not say this is the new \"best Charlotte burger\" (hey, Liberty, you're still on top).   The biscuits at the beginning were delicious, the bacon/cheddar burger and the mushroom/gruyere burger were both solid, and the fries were great. I hope this place stays open because it's a cool concept, but they might need to work on a few things, like adding some better salads to the menu...the \"seasonal vegetables\" were actually just cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots (according to our waiter, we didn't order it) which is disappointing. Up your veggie game and you'll be golden."}
{"text":"Our first time to visit Block & Grinder will certainly not be our last! My husband (a Culinary Institute of America Chef graduate) and our two dear \"foodie\" friends decided to try it out! We all checked out the menu and reviews prior to our reservation and wanted to see this unique concept and try out their interesting menu. We were hesitant at first as few (very few) of the reviews were not very good. Leads me to wonder if their critique is an example of their experiences every place they sample?  Let me say this first, those negative reviews are not reflective of our experience at all! We has a delightful experience!  It began with our reservation we needed to push back 30 minutes because we had a delay. They were more than accommodating on a busy Friday night, and we enjoyed waiting at the bar having great and interesting cocktails from a bar well dressed in interesting spirits & friendly knowledgable bartenders! The bar & dining area are a bit small, but from our research prior to our visit, we were prepared for that, NO problems here! As I said, bartenders were attentive and very quick at taking our drink order. Plus, a small bar area only lends itself to easy, fun conversation and the ability to share great conversation with other patrons!  Our cocktails were great. The guys chose the Maple Manhattan, wonderful and their Dark & Stormy, that is an interesting and delicious black rum and ginger beer combo.  Our waiter John was exceptional, offered great commentary of the dishes and very knowledgable about wine offerings.  Wonderful personally!  We all shared deviled eggs and beef  carpaccio, we loved the carpaccio, but the deviled eggs needed a bit of seasoning and were pleasantly supplied with their own blend of seasoning salt, one mesquite flavored, the other their own mixture pared well as the accent needed. Awesome!   The guys shared the bone in ribeye and short ribs. OUTSTANDING! The veggie sides were farm to marker local and the best green beans I ever had, nice preparation and flavor. Beef was absolutely seasoned and prepared to perfection!  We girls shared the shiitake mushroom with gruyere cheese burger cooked medium on a delicious bun.... RIDICULOUSLY delicious! The pommes frites      again, perfectly seasoned, and green beans delicious! The grits with the short rib dish also great!   Finish with the table splitting the  brandy bread pudding (thanks waiter John) and call it a win!  Cool, decor, great ambiance, outstanding service and food worthy of my hubby's praise (that don't come easy) and a table side visit from the chef, made dining at B&G a memorable first impression! Add in fabulous table conversation, this place is surly to be on all 4 of our must do list of great places to dine in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"So good. Ohhhhh soooooo good. I would hand out 5 stars but they have some work to do on their wait service. We waited what seemed like an eternity for drink refills, extras such as cream for the coffee or butter for the bread, etc.  Now, on to reasons why this place ROCKS!  1. It's a BUTCHER SHOPPE and a restaurant/bar! 2. It's FARM FRESH! 3. They make hand crafted cocktails. I had the Idol's Eye (New Amsterdam Vodka, Pear, Lemon, Ginger Beer, Boston Bittahs), which I would give a 9 out of 10. It was great! Other drinks ordered (and tasted) were the Gin Basil Smash (very basily, lemony and FRESH! loved it!), New Fashioned (really good for an \"Old Fashioned,\" not my style though), and a Manhattan. 4. Pork Belly. You must try it!! It's mouth watering and served with cornmeal pancakes. Ohhhh so tastey! 5. They serve marrow with their steak. IT'S AWESOME! 6. Their burgers are OUT OF THIS WORLD-one of the best burgers I've eaten, ground fresh! 7. The Duck. OH THE DUCK! You have to try the duck! You'll want to lick the plate, I'm telling you! 8. The wait staff places your order via an iPad... and pulls up your bill on the same! 9. If you like tea, try the Earl Grey Creme Brulee-it's scrumptious!  So so good, but so so expensive. We had drinks, appetizers, wine, entrees... and it was about $125/person. That ate up our \"date night\" budget for a while!  They don't take reservations, mind you. They are so small, the line will be long, it will take some patience, but get a delicious drink from the bar while you wait!"}
{"text":"The Food. The atmosphere. The bar. I love it. Great food. Chill vibes. All local. Charlotte staple."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed :( heard really good things about this place... We got the special elk burger and it literally was meat on a bun with some aioli and it was $18. That's like NYC prices... Our service Justin was awesome and hooked us up with a desert but I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Block & Grinder, truly I did!  Honestly, it's got potential, but unless we hear that some changes take place we probably won't be back...at least for dinner.  The overall ambience is crowded. And loud.  They pack far too many people into way too small of a space.  I can definitely see this making sense as a lunch spot, but for dinner it was much too crowded to be comfortable.  Case in point: the space between tables is so narrow that people trying to walk through can't help but make physical contact with each other.  Maybe the servers have squeezing in between diners down pat, but the elderly ladies sitting at the table next to us did not.   My idea of a good dining experience doesn't include having two elderly women's rear ends rubbed against my neck and shoulders as they try to squeeze by to exit the restaurant.  We tried to give them as much room as we possibly could, but there's just no room to maneuver if you've got mobility issues, which these two women did.  It was incredibly uncomfortable for us, and I'm sure the ladies weren't happy with it either.  Service was somewhat slow and there seemed to be confusion about what drinks were available (we ordered beer and wine - nothing fancy).  We were disappointed they said they wouldn't be serving Oskar Blues since Oskar Blues now brews beer in Brevard, NC and we like to drink local if we can.  After appetizers, a random server cleared some of our plates, but not all.  Same with silverware.  He never brought replacement silverware for those without, which seemed odd, and we were left with dirty plates.  There were high and low-points on the menu.  High points - the charcuterie was good, and the deviled eggs were delicious.  The mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts are also good.  Low points?  The burgers.  Somehow they managed to overcook all three of our burgers.  We all requested medium and everything came out well done.  The shiitake and gruyere burger was delicious even though it was overcooked, which speaks to the quality of the meat.  One of my friends ordered the scallops, which were the special of the day.  The scallops were also overcooked (there's seared and then there's burnt) and outrageously expensive ($32 for 4 sea scallops with some fennel and red pepper sauce?  Really?).  I would have sent my burger back, but since our server didn't come by to check on us until well into the meal, there didn't seem to be a point in doing so.    B&G has great potential.  Our experience boiled down to wonderful ingredients, poor execution.  I hope they can get it together soon!"}
{"text":"This is the best food I've had in my visits to Charlotte - everything was amazingly good and we are major foodies.  The deviled eggs- who orders them right? Well these were amazing with goat cheese as part of the blend. The fried oysters were very good also. Wines for 1/2 price a glass were a good deal too. Do we decided to share 1/2 of the duck- pan fried with fingerling potatoes, arugula and orange vinaigrette- excellent and the other 1/2 was the best burger I've ever had- ground fresh here with fabulously perfect fries on a toasted brioche- super yum! For dessert the apple bread pudding with burnout caramel sauce was perfection. If I lived in Charlotte, I'd become a regular for sure,"}
{"text":"All in CAPS: BEST! RESTAURANT! IN! CHARLOTTE!  Read again: BEST RESTAURANT IN CHARLOTTE!  I was already a big fan of B&G at Providence Rd. I went for a dinner event prior to opening and I can tell it was one of the best meals we have ever had in life.  The location is a lot larger than the original one, features a larger butcher shop and a CHEF'S TABLE! Chef Ben was absolutely on fire tonight and nailed every single dish. We ordered the duck among other dishes and the duck was so delicious that it out-beat one we had in Paris.  The restaurant is very well located into the Langtree Shopping center which is by the lake and features incredible views of Lake Norman.  If you come here I would suggest that you order the pork belly, the duck and the bread pudding for dessert. The wine list is quite interesting and I would suggest the Block and Tackle. Absolutely outstanding wine!  Service is also spectacular. We definately needed a good quality restaurant here in this area. We have a few that call themselves \"fine dining\" but they are nothing but overrated (see my other reviews for these places around here). If you are looking for the best meal of your life, you have come to the right place."}
{"text":"Went last night for opening night and really I'm hesitant to even review this place just yet because I understand that all new openings require refinement at some level.    We were greeted by a great host station and friendly smiles which is always a good start to any meal.  Once seated we were promptly given menus (rather large ones) and the great service continued.  We started out with a pick 3 deal for meats and cheeses, going with the prosciutto, wild boar sausage and a Thomasville Thomme cheese.   All three were great and completely filling but I had enough left in the tank for dinner of course.  Dinner for me was a wild game meatloaf and seriously was the best meatloaf I think I've ever had.     The decor is warm and appeal ling although it might be considered small.  I actually like that it's not a huge dining hall.  The kitchen is always in view as well as some great window spots.  My guess is that this place will be a 4-5 star joint in little to no time."}
{"text":"Years ago, I placed a special butcher order through Block & Grinder and they exceeded my expectations. I told myself then I'd make an effort to get back and eat in the restaurant, and though it took awhile for me to return, I found it hardly worth my wait.  A date brought me here on a Thursday night. It was pretty full, but we were quickly seated. Our shaggy-haired server arrived and dropped off menus. When he came by again to see if we had any questions about the menu, I mentioned that I would be dining gluten free and asked if there was anything I should be aware of. He replied with \"the menu is pretty self-explanatory\" and wandered off.   We started with the deviled eggs. I'm not generally a fan of goat cheese, but it added a delightful creaminess and subtle tang to the eggs. They came 5 to an order, which was a bit awkward.   I decided on the duck breast for my entree, and when I placed my order I inquired if I could substitute the side, as it came with sweet potato dumplings which were not GF. He said, \"Sure, but switching a side will add a $2 substitution fee.\" I came back with, \"Well, if it keeps me from getting sick, two dollars seems worth the investment.\" I felt like he wasn't taking my dietary restriction seriously, as though he sized me up upon being seated and pinned me as difficult (and cheap).  When our meals arrived, the temperatures were all over the place. We had both ordered a side of brussels sprouts, which came in cast iron dishes. They were lava hot, and underseasoned. My duck, cooked medium per chef's recommendation, was cold and sliced unevenly. It was clear that my entree sat while my date's steak was cooked.   Overall, I found myself disappointed by our server and by the timing of our dishes. I'm open-minded enough to give Block & Grinder another try, but I may just stick to the butcher counter from here on out."}
{"text":"Good service at bar, generous wine pours. Some non meat offerings.  Expensive"}
{"text":"Very high quality ingredients and competent chef skills are apparent.  Service? Mediocre to annoying.   Prices? Fair for burgers. High for entrees... Such as 30 for a strip steak plus 9 for a salad plus 4 for a side  Menu? For meat lovers."}
{"text":"This terrific neighborhood steakhouse and butcher shop is a great alternative to the more upscale spots in SouthPark and Uptown, and a wonderful addition to South Charlotte's restaurant scene. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there a few weeks back, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Our filets were cooked to perfection, the salads were crisp and delicious, and our sides of Mac & Cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were both outstanding.  For a restaurant its size, Block & Grinder boasts one of the best wine selections around, along with a knowledgeable waitstaff who can confidently recommend the best pairing for each meal. There's also a terrific selection of local craft beers on tap, and a small bar for when you just want to drop in for some drinks and an appetizer after work.  Besides the wonderful meal and attentive service, what I liked most about this place was its casual, laid-back atmosphere. Feel free to leave the jacket at home -- you'll do fine in jeans and a polo shirt. It's the trendy neighborhood spot you'd expect to find in Dilworth or Uptown, yet only minutes from the Arboretum and Stonecrest.   My wife and I will definitely be making another trip to Block & Grinder -- maybe next time, we'll even take home some chops for the grill."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. The food and service gets better each time I eat here. Glad this \"neighborhood gem\" is close to where I live as I expect this will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe here and the fact it is also a butcher shop. I lived ordering several of the small appetizers to share and the beef was delicious. I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"The service was great. The meat was correctly cooked and seasoned. The wine was well paired with the meal. Fantastic"}
{"text":"What's there to say?  This is by far my favorite restaurant.  Great ambiance, amazing food, and superb service.  Everything is locally farmed, and there's a freaking butcher-shop right there in the restaurant.  Date nights are always a success when you leave here.  I know this is not for the timid vegetarians, but my god they know everything there is to know about meat, and pairings of sides, and wines.  Everything on every plate comes together in perfect harmony.  If I could eat here once a week I'll be a happy camper.  My number 1 place to recommend to people when I get asked for a good date spot, or just a great meal.  I'd hit it again......and again......and again!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, and it did not disappoint. Great service during our late Sunday brunch, and the best burger I've had since moving to Charlotte a year ago. The bacon and pimiento burger is a must-order! My husband had the B&G benedict with house-made biscuits, which was also delicious! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch, got the dinner menu. Bartender/server was excellent. He recommended several beers that were all delicious. I was in the mood for a burger and he recommended the filet/bacon burger. Holy s*** that is easily in my top 5 burgers of all time. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"One of the Top 5 restaurants in Charlotte, hands down! Maybe even our favorite but it's just so hard to pick. The pork belly small plate is a must. All of their meats are locally sourced and always perfectly seasoned and cooked. Sides are well thought out and complement the main without fail. I love their wild game specials. Things like venison and boar shine. Great beer and wine selection. Excellent desert. Even their coffee (French press) is to die for!"}
{"text":"Place is a rip off. Tries to be a trendy organic food spot, but fails terribly. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese as it came highly recommended, and it turned out to be a bowl of bland noodles with barely any cheese. Burger was sub par, and the deviled eggs were the worst I've ever had. Made better deviled eggs with my grandma when I was 11."}
{"text":"You can't mess with their short ribs. Best item on the menu, bar none. This place set the bar on grits for me, too (I'm a Yankee) and has thus ruined me for grits eaten pretty much anywhere else.Excellent drinks, too.  The emphasis at Block & Grinder is definitely on quality and seasonality - they clearly take pride in their menu. The one thing I would say is that the service level among staff isn't completely consistent - some servers/hosts are definitely friendlier and more polished than others - but I still love going here. We also bought (really pricey, fair warning!) tenderloin steaks for Christmas dinner from B & G, and they were maybe the best I've ever had. A great spot for a quality meal and for quality meat you'll make at home for those occasions where you want to splash out and be fancy about it."}
{"text":"Great spot. It's tucked away in a little plaza. I've driven by so many times and missed it. Don't make the same mistake! We went for lunch and sat outside (I'm hoping when summer really kicks off it won't be enclosed.) they have a good selection of cocktails and wine. On my first visit I ordered the Cubano and my boyfriend ordered the burger with a duck egg bacon and cheese. Amazing!! These two items are worth a try!   I've since been back for lunch. This time we ordered several small plates to share. The Pork Belly is a must! The bourbon sorghum glaze is amazing! The deviled eggs have a twist with goat cheese and truffle oil. The Beef Tartare was good, but not my favorite.   If you haven't stopped in, you are really missing out!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Fatty meat, hard fries, no bread service and expensive.  We got a cheeseburger that had hard parts in it and the hanger steak which was so fatty we couldn't even chew most of it.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice staff but not worth the money. Pastrami sandwich was a joke. As a whole , the restaurant has potential but I don't think I'll go back any time soon"}
{"text":"Cool restaurant with an in-house butcher shop. Food is great as I was able to sample some interesting dishes - venison steak and an kangaroo burger. Both were fantastic and full of flavor. The spices complimented the kangaroo extremely well. The service was excellent and our server was always around to ensure the meal was going well. Definitely a spot I'll be going back to!"}
{"text":"I really like the idea of the Block & Grinder, but I really dislike the execution.  For starters, getting into the location stinks. This isn't just their fault - there are plenty of other places in the same shops that have the same problem - about the only way that is easy is if you're headed uptown on Providence, and I'm never headed that way unless I think of it in advance, which I never do.  Beyond that, the hours never work for me. I tend to think of it as an afterthought, and though I don't often get out late, for whatever reason I tend to get by Block & Grinder late - so I find it odd when we pop in at 9:30 or so and are told that they are closing.  This is the perfect place to kick back, have a cocktail and enjoy some bites that you can't find much of anywhere else in town, but... YOU CAN'T BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSING HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THAN THEIR HOURS SAY THEY WILL.  I get that they don't want to start something late, and that's fine - but at least a cheese plate or something would have been nice, and keeping the amazing bar area open would be even better. Oh well.  If you should happen to get there at a better time, then the food is more interesting than just about anywhere in town, and the cocktails are totally worthwhile. Try the chupacabra if you can get it."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday before the opera without s reservation right when they opened - party of 6, it got busy quick. So delicious! Great service. Cool concept. Will return."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Block & Grinder; both the food and service were phenomenal in my first visit here.   The food:  We started with the deviled egg appetizer, which came out as five deviled egg halves. The filling was great - it had a good mustard flavor with a hint of goat cheese that they put in. The prosciutto on top was perfect. It added a little saltiness and meaty flavor to the deviled eggs and was just the right size to add flavor but not overpower. For my entrée I ordered their beef burger with NY Cheddar medium rare. I thought about trying the game burger of the day (kangaroo) but decided to stick with beef since it was my first time here- definitely thinking of branching out next time. I was very happy to be able to order a burger as rare as I want because most places offer medium at best and even cook that a bit more than they should. Not with Block & Grinder, this burger had a nice pink center. It was super juicy, and it was seasoned well but also maintained great meaty flavor. The patty was just a little smaller than expected but quality over quantity was fine in this case for me. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly pancakes as her entrée, and they were a pile of pork fat goodness. The pork belly had incredible flavor and was extremely tender, but the pancakes and slaw were great as well. The slaw was sweet but with just a hint of vinegar and the pancakes were soft but didn't get mushy under all the juices either.  We shared a side of mac & cheese with our entrees as well. No surprise at this point, it was great! The corkscrew noodles were perfectly al dente and the cheese sauce was awesome. It was buttery and really cheesy compared to most restaurants' mac & cheese, which was great because more cheese always = better. The few breadcrumbs on top were a nice touch as well. We finished off the meal with the Hot Fudge Sundae. It had salted caramel ice cream, which I enjoyed despite not liking caramel much and came with hot fudge, candied pecans, a cherry, and was served in a bacon bowl. Yes that is correct, they turn bacon into a paste, add some brown sugar and maple syrup or other sweet goodness and bake it into a bowl. The bacon bowl was good, although not my favorite, but the candied pecans were awesome. Very cool and pretty tasty dessert overall.   The service was stellar as well. Our server, Chris, was really knowledgeable about the menu and was even nice enough to point out the favorites on the menu and the items that were less liked. They change their menu every few weeks since they're farm to table and stop serving things that guests don't love, which I think is awesome. Our drinks were consistently refilled, and we were checked on constantly but not so much that it was an annoyance or interrupted conversation.  The portions were good, the prices weren't bad, and both the food and service really blew me away."}
{"text":"Great specialty meat house. Butcher shop available to take something home and great fare for casual dinner on site. Small, casual, come as you are atmosphere. Great specialty fare like Bison, Ground lamb, outstanding beef burgers with special toppings lick fries duck eggs. Reservations recommended but they have a couple of first come first serve tables in the front."}
{"text":"Tremendous food in a cool atmosphere. Trust the wait stuff on what's hot and fresh as far as meat offerings are concerned. The menu changes very frequently based on availability. Try something different. The fries are in best of Charlotte category. The pork belly appetizer is a don't miss your first time. The bison burger was tasty full of flavor."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. The food was very good and the service attentive. The decor is hip but not overdone. One particular aspect that I like about B+G is that they include venison and other wild game as part of their menu. I had the wild game (elk) burger and it was excellent. Great for lunch or a casual date night."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this.  Rather small space, but the kitchen is always crazy busy, and everything that comes out is incredible. It's a restaurant and a butcher shop that serves top-notch quality meats cooked to perfection. So far, we've just sampled the burgers. The beef is ground in-house and cooked to order; when you say \"medium,\" it's a true medium. The flavor is outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed the Block & Grinder burger, as well as the veggie burger (on recommendation by our server). Their lamb and feta burger is superb as well - The Liberty just got ousted.  The lightly seasoned fries on the side are a nice complement that support the main dish, not just filler. The micro-sized biscuits you get while waiting are addictive like you wouldn't believe. We were also told to try the deviled eggs. Not sure what they do to them, but it's definitely takes them to a whole new level.  They have a fairly robust beer and wine list that covers every flavor profile you would like. On both visits, the servers have been as knowledgeable about the beverages as they have been about the food, and are eager to share what they know. Everyone we've encountered so far has been remarkably friendly. Even when it's busy, they don't suffer quality of service.  The only downside is how busy this place can get - weekend waits can be up to 90 minutes. Definitely want to call ahead. Next time I might have to try one of the entrees. I can only imagine how great the steaks are, and I have my eye on the rabbit dish, too."}
{"text":"I went to Block & Grinder on a Friday night (2/17) with a friend. Overall our experience was just ok, borderline not good. I called earlier in the day to make a reservation because I thought the restaurant may be crowded around the time we were interested in going, but the girl who claimed to have my reservation never did. Thankfully the restaurant was not busy at all upon our arrival. Our server took a little longer than he should have to come over, seeing as we were one of the only two tables of people in the restaurant. The food is definitely over priced for the quality. My steak was good but way underseasoned, while my friends salmon was so salty it was not even edible. The server was extremely unattentive, especially once my friend asked could his salmon be replaced with something else. The manager who worked that evening was extremely pleasant and did not make us feel like we were putting him out for asking for the salmon to be replaced. The drinks were mediocre and so was the atmosphere. The restaurant just didn't strike me  as a \"fancy\" restaurant and the price of the food did not match the atmosphere and/or service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to B&G a couple of times as a customer for the butcher shop part of the business. The quality of their meat is excellent, and they have very attentive customer service.  Tonight we went in for dinner, as my mom is in town. I've been telling her about the place and she was eager to try it. I will agree with others who state it's not in an ideal location - but this is a classy, sleek joint. I was in the mood for a beer, and they have a lot on tap. I had a smoked amber that was very good.   I ordered the Pork Belly appetizer, and my mom the Beef Tartare. I've had the Pork Belly before and it is amazing. The Bourbon-Sorghum glaze is delicious, and the Pork Belly cooked to perfection. My mom was very happy with the Tartare, but would have liked it served with a sturdy rye or different bread for texture.   We both ordered the special of a Salem Hills Farm Grassfed Ribeye over a salad of heirloom tomatoes, arugula, and vinaigrette; and both ordered our steaks cooked black and blue. For those that don't know what black and blue is, it's a very rare steak - sear it and put it on the plate. :)  The steaks were cooked to perfection, and the heirloom tomato salad a perfect, bright complement. We also ordered two sides to split - the Garlic Cheese Mashed Potatoes and the Butter Wilted Spinach. Both were very good, and a good portion of each to split between two.  Neither of us finished, and brought steak home...but that left room for dessert. I had the Banana Pudding, and my mom the Chocolate Creme Brulee. The banana pudding was very good - served with crisp Nilla wafers, lots of fresh bananas, a lovely Chantilly cream, and topped with caramelized bananas. The pudding itself was creamy and packed a punch of banana....also tasted like a banana puree. My mom liked her Chocolate Creme Brulee, particularly the richness of the chocolate.  Our waitress, Red, was friendly, knowledgeable about the specifics on everything we asked her, and provided the great service that I would expect in a restaurant like this. All of the staff were friendly and attentive, and it was a great customer experience.  Was it pricey? Yes. I don't mind paying for a seriously great meal. The only thing that kept them from five stars were the bar prices."}
{"text":"I had heard so many rave reviews about Block and Grinder I could not wait to FINALLY eat there! A little background-I am a big fan of steak, lamb, etc. etc. I don't eat it every day, but when I do, I want the best.  We started with the deviled eggs with goat cheese and prosciutto. Yum! The goat cheese added an extra creaminess to the yolk and I could definitely pick up on some truffle salt that was super delicious.   For my entrée, after debating between the filet and lamb burger, I went for the lamb burger.  I was feeling extra hungry and naughty.  The lamb patty itself was delicious. I really enjoyed the melted feta on top, but found it to be a bit overpowering. To be honest, I was expecting a larger burger, and found myself craving more. And I am one of those people that hates super large portions.  I did not think there was enough meat to the burger. The fries it came with were very tasty but not out of the ordinary.  I tasted my dad's filet and it was delicious, but again, on the small side.   For dessert, we split the chocolate pecan pie tartlets. They were so cute and tiny...served warm. Very good. Would have been even better with a scoop of vanilla.   I have to say that my cocktail was excellent: The Final Fig with Topo vodka, Cointreau, fig syrup and lemon. Very strong, but sweet and yummy! Definitely one to sip on.    I would return to Block and Grinder but wish they would either increase their portion sizes or lower their prices to match the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Very good lunch today. Had the pork belly small plate, wife had the B&G burger.  Service was great, food was excellent, we look forward to coming back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"My review is for lunch, not dinner, so I suppose it's unfair to make a sweeping judgment based on one meal, but overall I was not impressed. They did an amazing job marketing this place. Their website is professional - full of beautiful food photography and their Facebook page is active and lively. The restaurant itself is modern, bright and nicely decorated. But all of this did not translate to the plate. Myself and two friends had lunch at Block & Grinder on 4/10/13. We had heard they had been open for a few weeks but we decided to wait to make sure they were in their groove and everything was running smoothly. I had the house cured corned beef sandwich with fries (pommes frites). One friend had Henry's grilled cheese sandwich and the other had the B&G Burger. Theirs came with fries as well. The burger was to be cooked to medium, but came out too rare. It was not very well seasoned and my friend said it was a little bland. Her fries were ice cold. My corned beef tasted very good but it was basically 3 or 4 slices of corned beef (maybe 3 oz.), slapped on a piece of bread with a tiny smear of mustard - that's it. Something this simple and plain should not cost $10. At least put some slaw or a small salad on the side. I also received ice cold fries. The last dish was the grilled cheese. I didn't think pear and cheese would work together, but they did. It was actually the best thing any of us had and saved this review from being one star. Again, more cold fries were served with this final plate. Cold fries are unforgivable from a place trying to pass itself off as \"made to order.\" I'd rather wait another 5 minutes for everything to be cooked fresh and come out hot than have fries sitting around in the A/C while the rest of the food cooks.   We assumed they would be swamped so we arrived at 11:40 (they open at 11:30) but there was only one other table that had people - it was a larger group of about 7 but the rest of the place was empty and never really filled up the 45 minutes we were there. I think what is disappointing is the fact that our food got cold despite there not being a rush and there were at least 3 or 4 servers. Also, I get that they want to try to be high-tech, but using an iPad to take our orders and also run our credit cards right at the table is awkward. Instead of saving time it actually took more time because our server had to hunt and peck the order in rather than just writing it down and punching it in at a register the traditional way. Also, his credit card reader didn't work on the iPad so he had to go run our bills the old fashioned way regardless. Cool idea, but poor execution.   Finally, if I were to judge B&G solely on taste, I'd give them a 3.5 but there's room for improvement in that department and there's so much more to the overall dinning experience that needs improvement as well. Cold and undercooked food is a huge negative in my book. Not a great first impression but hopefully they will read this and improve. I'll give it another shot in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for a night out. Excellent fresh food and cocktails, friendly & knowledgeable staff. Dessert options have been limited the times we've been. I would encourage owners to consider a few more options that aren't as heavy on nuts or egg based dishes, as there is a large population with allergies to those."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed based on the Yelp reviews I read. In Charlotte for the summer and decided to try when my girlfriend came into town. Did brunch on Sunday afternoon. We arrive, restaurant is half empty and are sat immediately. Sitting there, just sitting there. Hostess realizes we could use water, then realizes we don't even have a place setting and she was the one who sat us there. Anyways, we wait for a good 8-10 minutes without any contact from our waiter, only an apology from the hostess. Finally waiter shows up, doesn't seem that interested  and just asks for our order. As a former waiter I was mildly annoyed by this since its usually best to greet the customer, ask if they any questions and make good suggestions. My girlfriend goes with cinnamon rolls/bacon and I end up with the B&G Steak and Eggs with a Bloody Mary and coffee. We wait, we wait some more. OUR FOOD ARRIVES BEFORE OUR DRINKS? Then our waiter finally delivers drinks and makes blunder after blunder after blunder. I seriously don't know what this guy's deal was.  The food: Mine was excellent. Steak was perfect (asked for rare, got rare) and the cornmeal pancakes were an amazing addition. Blood Mary almost tasted sweet? Wasn't a fan. My girlfriend's sweet roll was tasty and gourmet tasting but DRY, DRY, DRY. Moral of the story: dropped $60 on non-bottomless brunch for an unusually poor dining experience. I think that was the first time in my life I tipped 12%. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Would have given this 5 stars if maneuvering in and out of their lot was easier.  It is hard to get into the lot and once in, parking is narrow.  However, this meal ranks around the best in Charlotte! Since so many reviewers raved about the deviled eggs, it was a must have and we also ordered the cheese board.  The brie/bleu cheese will change your life-creamy and not too bleu cheesy.   The steak sandwich and fries were delicious as was the smokey chicken salad. Not overpoweringly smokey over micro greens, pecans, etc.   A little more pricey for lunch but, well worth the treat. They have an actual butcher shop you can order from as well as take-out.  Atmosphere was casual with a nice local beer menu and multiple tv's tuned to various games."}
{"text":"First off, props to Block & Grinder for hosting several preview nights before opening - glad to be invited to the last one! When we first arrived, we were handed a drink menu with several types of specialty cocktails. Spoke with the bartender who mentioned they will feature 10 \"classic\" old-style cocktails, like a sidecar, and 10 modern cocktails. We had the tequila daisy which was quite tasty and had a bite in the liquor. The blood water is also very good but would probably only order one. The bartender also made a specialty basil drink which I would highly recommend. A smooth drink, indeed. These are all drinks I would sip and would pair nicely with dinner - if you are looking for a night out with drinks, don't feel like this is the place.  When we sat down for dinner, the server was amazing. Any questions you asked, he knew the answer to. He was fully aware of all the ingredients and despite the busy nature of the restaurant, he definitely took his time and always had a patient, pleasant demeanor. Highly impressed by the staff!  The invitation night allowed us to try many different items. The palmetto cheese is basically pimento cheese made with cream cheese. It gave it a smooth consistency and basically what we expected. The pork belly tacos were amazing - best thing we sampled all night long. The tacos came wrapped in a potato pancake and topped with a cole slaw type mix. Definitely a winner.  For entrees, we ordered the duck, Carolina rabbit and porterhouse steak. The duck was tasty with a nice crisp outside and I would order it again - wasn't too impressed with the sauce that topped the meat. It had little flavor and didn't feel as though it complimented the meat. The Carolina rabbit was served wrapped in prosciutto and surrounded with grits. The presentation was great and the entree was also tasty. The porterhouse we were quite disappointed with. We order the steak medium rare but it came out medium, with the outside edge almost medium well. The steak wasn't seasoned which left the entree bland. Towards the end of the cut, a few pieces were quite delicious and tasted as though it was seasoned. It lead us to believe that maybe the chef was in a hurry due to the full house and the steak was left mostly unseasoned by mistake.  And then there was the dessert. The server informed us the desserts would rotate depending on customer reactions and the seasons. We order the creme brulee which was good and full of flavor. We finished with the seared pear, topped with a Cheerwine sauce. The pear was difficult to cut apart and while I compliment the combination of the sauce with Cheerwine, it wasn't my favorite and won't be ordering the dessert again.  However, Block & Grinder is certainly a restaurant I'd visit again on occasion. The price points are a bit high for entrees so it wouldn't be a regular stop of mine but definitely a place I'd sample again to see what the chef is cooking up."}
{"text":"This is the classiest butcher shop I have ever been to. If you're looking for a meat filled night out, this is the place for you! Make sure you try the pork belly and the macaroni and cheese, which is the best I've had in Charlotte so far.  This is a great place to visit if you're looking for new versions of classic cocktails (Manhattan, Cosmopolitan, Old Fashioned, etc.) Bring a full wallet, an empty stomach, and a date - and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband had the best fillet in his life! He raised Herefords so this is quite the praise! I had the deviled eggs. Wasn't impressed. My mom makes better."}
{"text":"Came tonight for dinner with a group. It was a nice experience, however - all of us ordered burgers, and everyone I asked at my table said there's was overlooked. My husband and I ordered medium and they came well done and then some. For $15 it should really come the temperature you order it. Especially since this place prides itself on its meat.   We also noticed that the menu had the house burger at $14 but they rang up as $15. We told our server but he only adjusted one persons ticket. The rest of us just paid the extra dollar to save the hassle but I think you guys should go ahead and fix that in the system."}
{"text":"I love this place. Wonderful farm to table fare, upbeat staff, and good music piped into the background. Been there for 5 or 6 dinners, they always are spot on. Still thinking about the venison I ate two hrs ago."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Glad I finally came on a pretty quiet Friday evening. My server, Matt, was extremely attentive and gracious. (I think sometimes single diners get overlooked.) I ordered the lamb burger, that he misheard as regular. Upon receipt he practically insisted on making the right thing - I appreciated that!   To drink, I had the gin smash - you should have one too! It was equal parts strong and flavorful. Next, I let my server recommend a nice dry red...he nailed it!   To eat, I had the lamb burger - it was flavorful with feta cheese, and I added bacon. It was a little dry, but I also ordered medium well. Potentially would have been more moist cooked medium.  Overall, I really like this place! I think I may have found a new, perfect work/hangout spot close to home."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  I love that there's a market in the front where you can purchase meats to prepare at home.  I love the eclectic menu, including the bone marrow dish.  Many of the dishes have ingredients you might not have heard of, but there are old standards, too.  We did not try the steak, but we might next time.  The restaurant is a little louder than you might expect, but it is what you would expect out of a restaurant in NYC - unique, yet approachable.    I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"We loved this place! It's got a really nice local dinner spot vibe and has reasonably upscale food without feeling pretentious. Cheer wine bread pudding is awesome and I'm not typically a bread pudding fan. We've been here twice and have been very happy with it both times."}
{"text":"everything was so fresh and tasty  the beef tartare: friend's favorite pork belly: super flavorful  deviled eggs: not recommended. did not taste like goat cheese, tiny little itty bitty slice of prosciutto on each piece tomato, mozzarella salad w/ balsamic: loved! huge slices of tomato  very friendly server; loved the cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is small and intimate. Maybe a little too small because the tables were so close together.   When I walked in, the hostess asked if we had reservations.  I didn't even realize they did reservations.  Even though we didn't have reservations, we were sat right away. I do like that you can make reservations here.  I tried the Block & Grinder burger with maple bacon and pimento cheese.  I didn't like that the bacon wasn't thick cut.  I couldn't even taste the bacon on my burger. And the pimento cheese was like sliced cheese melted on the burger.  Its definitely not what I had expected.  Overall, the burger was good.  It just wasn't mind blowing.  I also had a side of Mac and 3 cheese.  I'm not sure what the 3 different cheeses were, but I could distinctly taste a cheese that I didn't like.  To complete the dining experience... I had the chocolate and peanut butter bread pudding.  The bread pudding was good.  Everything that I had here was good but it wasn't the best. If you're looking for a great burger than I would rather go to The Liberty.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Block and Grinder and we will definitely be back. Ben, our server, was very friendly, knowledgable and overall excited about their story and food. He recommended dishes and wine which I appreciate. We had the option going to the wine cellar to choose anything we wanted.   I had the pork chop with corn dressing and spinach (instead of succotash). The pork chop with the sage sauce was awesome. My husband had the special burger - filet, ribeye and bacon ground together served simply with cheddar and shoestring onions. He said he understands why they are known for their burgers.   Lots to choose from on the menu and everything sounded great. Charcuterie and homemade pork belly are next on my list.   Looking forward to going here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I  recently ate dinner here for the first time with another couple and it was wonderful!   Our server was very knowledgeable about the wine options and drinks offered from the bar. We were pleased with the wine recommendations.  While this place features incredible quality meats, I ordered the lentil burger because I am plant based and it was wonderful! I loved it and would order it again. The amount of food was very generous also.   My husband ordered the pork chop and it was awesome. It was very simple and the rub used had excellent flavor. The chop was grilled and done just perfectly.   Our friends ordered the scallops and filet, they were very happy with their choices. Three sides of veggies were delicious. Pan seared corn, sweet potato succotash and brussel sprouts were delicious!   I would definitely recommend dining here!"}
{"text":"Not only is Block and Grinder great for dinner, Jed and his team gave us a perfect brunch after our daughter's baptism.  Planning for the brunch was a pleasure and the event was perfect - the food was delicious and the staff was wonderful with adults and kids alike.  If you are looking for a great place to host a private event, I'd highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Block and Grinder has the best burgers in town! I always add a duck egg to mine!  All the sides are fresh and delicious.  Beer choice is limits, but the selection is stellar. I've only gone to dinner, but I'm sure their lunch is good too."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I finally decided to check this place out. I recommend you do as well if you're looking for some delicious food.  The location is nice, but I feel that the parking is a little tight.  Note that there is also additional parking underground!  Eating at Block & Grinder was the first time that I had used the underground parking, not too bad.  I really liked the atmosphere of this place.  It's just the right size for a nice and intimate dinner with a small group of friends.  Of course you can have a bigger party there, but I enjoyed the intimacy I had with my friends.  Definitely check out the decor all around.  There were skillets near the wall I was sitting close to, and at the top near where they display the steaks, I noticed a grinder displayed within the wall.  I just loved looking all around at the different decorations.  I had visited this place for dinner and it was just amazing.  If you are in a group and don't mind sharing, get varieties of the small plates.  I had tried the Pork Belly, B&G Wild Game Chili and the Beef Carpaccio.  The Beef Carpaccio was my favorite, but it was definitely hard to pick which one I loved the most at the time.  This morning, I did wake up craving those Pork Belly, so it made an impression on me.  For my entree, I had ordered the Cajun Bison Burger.  I was super excited!  The burger was good, but I was hoping to have more taste of cajun spice, but I just didn't taste it.  It was still pretty good for a burger.  When I had asked for some pepper, I had pepper and three other selections for salt!  Try it out.  For my side, I had ordered some Garlic Mashed Potatoes and once that hit my mouth, I knew I mad the right decision in life.  Order it as your side!  The service here was really wonderful as well..  All the staff were pleasant and helpful.  You won't see a mean or sad face here.  So my suggestion, if you live in Charlotte, check it out."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at block and grinder last weekend. We didn't make reservations which we should have on a busy Saturday night, but were seated right away when we walked in. Our waiter was very knowledgeable- giving advice, going over specials and suggestions. We ordered the charcuterie board to start, with duck ham, prosciutto and a soft mozzarella. It was served on a bed or arugula with mustard and toast.. and it was excellent. The cocktails were great, and our main courses were out of this world. I got a filet with brussels sprout, and my fiancé got venison over a bed of mushrooms and onion that was out of this world. Everything about this place is 5 stars, we throughly enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here after dinner for a drink. The interior is small but well set up, there was nobody at the bar so we sat there. They have a really interesting and unique drink menu... based off of old fashioned drinks you dont see any more. Feel bad for the bartenders because they are definately labor intestive! They were not super busy which was nice, the bartender let us know on Fri/Sat it was insane in there... its new, its small and I am sure it gets way packed. I will definately go back to eat but aim for lunch or an 'off time'. The bartender did talk to us quite a bit... we really were not looking to talk but figured they were bored since not a lot going on... she complain about yelpers eating there and the reviews they were posting which I found amusing."}
{"text":"Wow. Someone pinch me. I think I am dreaming.  Block and Grinder was just as great the second time around as it was the first time, almost a year ago.  The idea that a butcher shop can also be a fantastic restaurant is cutting edge, in my opinion.  The reservations are super easy to make and they are very welcoming when you arrive.  Parking is plentiful with handicapped parking within a few feet of the front door.  There is an outside area for dinning that is covered and warmed in the winter.  If you enjoy their burgers, you can ask for a Block and Grinder bacon cheese burger kit that will have everything you need to grill out at your next outdoor picnic.    The waitstaff are knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to each table they serve.  I was very impressed by the quality and flavor of the meat of my bison burger.  It was DELISH!     I would most certainly come back and look forward to tasting some more fantastic dishes."}
{"text":"We are Tuesday night regulars at this place because our daughter goes to gymnastics next door. I've never had a bad experience here. The steak is always cooked perfectly, the conversations are great (we sit at the bar with Savvas), and I couldn't ask for a more wonderful little place!   We love this place so much, that we had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here! Service is on point, if you need anything - just ask. Everyone here is more than willing to go the extra mile. The chef is fantastic and regularly comes out to chat before it gets busy and always offers advice on where we should eat at next! I always look forward to Tuesday evenings with the crew at B&G on Providence.  I also frequently purchase meat from the butcher here if we do not have time for a sit down dinner. Small selection, but everything you could get is amazing."}
{"text":"First time here.   I had the Elk chops and my friend had the Venison.  Both cooked medium.    Loved the Elk but the bite I tried of my friends Venison was AMAZING!  The atmosphere was great, lighting was great.   Fantastic dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Today was a Block & Grinder type of day. So I heard this place use to be a Panda Express, good thing it wasn't. When I walked in I was amazed on just how much of a transformation this place had to undergo to change from a Chinese restaurant to the best new \"Meat Factory\" in Charlotte, NC. First off the bar is stacked (I feel like a jock in high school writing/saying that) with drinks out the wazoo and the bartender knows what he is doing. He's a mixologist. The drink I tried was called, Parkside Fizz: New Amsterdam Vodka, Lemon, Orgeat, Mint, Soda, Minty but good. The ambiance and decor of Block & Grinder will make any restaurant decorator drool, it's like your eating in the butcher shop ; which you are. I wouldn't be surprised is other restaurants come here to get there meat ground.  Alright enough of that on to my meal. I decided to switch things up and order the lamb burger. BEST DAMN LAMB BURGER I EVER HAD. Enough said. The lamb was juicy, succulent, savory,  and just delicious.  I didn't have to add any type of disguise to my burger at all; no ketchup, mustard, mayo anything. The feta cheese was the perfect accent to this burger. The only thing that threw me off was my girlfriend and her friend screaming about how great the bacon was just because they made their own bacon on the premises. On the side there were some Pommes Frites, you could tell they were fresh but just a little to oily for me. Overall Block & Grinder was a perfect exclamation to my night and it also is a must try to everyone in Charlotte and all visitors."}
{"text":"I like how this place does not tie itself to CLT restaurant conventions.  Not a large seating area, but plenty of room for those who are seated. No excessive noise but a comfortable dining experience with a focus on the (almost) decadent meats. Where else can you get bone marrow--roasted in side a large bone sawed in half, we a large dose of a fresh garlic pesto and a special fork to get it out. They have a $25 foie gras burger. My wife asked if she could have foie gras alone and was quickly accommodated with a huge $16 appetizer portion with little pieces of toast and thinly shaved prosciutto. I had the lamb burger medium rare which was phenomenal with a strong gamey flavor and tasty aioli sauce. Accompanied by pomme frites that were perfect. Some Brussels sprouts garnished with house prepared bacon was as good as those at Tupelo Honey. The waiter Mike was great, very knowledgable about the food and its preparation. He did a good job pitching us on a dill based Bloody Mary mix that is excellent. Only weakness is the dessert menu which lacks a chocolate dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent on all counts!  The pork belly is not to be missed.  Will start working our way through the rest of the menu on future visits."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about this place but since my wife opted for a vegan food regimen, hitting up a place with counters of steaks and a menu focus on meat is going to make for a difficult date night. So when I was in the area on my own, I popped in for lunch.  Nice menu with, of course, a lot of meats. I chose the store-made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Grilled on rye bread, the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy. Maybe a little greasy, but that's to be expected.  The mac & cheese was excellent. I'm not sure what cheese they put in there, but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it. Also a little oily at the bottom and that's also to be expected.  Service was good, the speed of my meal was good and the price was acceptable.  Looking forward to returning with a meat eater."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I've had in ages. Our waiter Savvas was one of the nicest fellows imaginable. Our party of three was catered to very well. We told him of an allergy that a member of our party had and he went above and beyond to make sure every measure was taken for her. After our meal we were greeted by the chef who was exceptional nice. Great experience, will definitely eat there many times in the future. We are already planning a small party to be had there. Great restaurant, highly recommend it. Food is amazing, customer service is equally as good!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Block & Grinder last week for a date night dinner. We had never been here before, but have heard good things.  After taking a look at the photos on Yelp, and looking at reviews we decided to try this place.  When we arrived we were seated right away, as we went early on a Friday night. The wait staff was friendly, and service was quick.  We ordered beverages, I got the dark and stormy cocktail , that was delicious.( I like that they put half a lime in it).  For appetizers we order the fried oysters which were served on a delicious bed of roasted corn and arugula. These were very good and I enjoyed the sauce that they came with.  My husband and I both ordered steaks, he a New York strip, and I ribeye. Those steaks were cooked perfectly as we ordered them and were absolutely delicious. My steak came with a blue cheese crust that was creamy and rich. We also got the mac and cheese and zucchini as our sides. The mac and cheese is delicious as the noodles are cooked al dente in the cheese sauce is rich and very smooth. The zucchini was very good and cook so that it wasn't squishy but still crisp.  Well the dessert menu look great we didn't have enough room for anything else. The whole overall experience was great, and we can't wait to go back again and try their burgers.  Highly recommend this place, if you're looking for a nice date night or a place to get a delicious burger!"}
{"text":"If it were not for our waiter, I'd given this restaurant two stars.  Our waiter was amazing!  The porky belly appetizer was simply too much for my friend and me.  It was full of flavor, but way too much grease even after the first bite.    The deviled eggs were beautiful in presentation, but low on flavor and seasonings.  My friend and I agreed we could make better deviled eggs at home.  Our filets were pretty awesome...that is after we realized that she received my light pink center and I received her medium well filet.  Last, we had the bread pudding.  Maybe it's unfair that I compare all bread pudding desserts to Ruth Chris, but they've set the bar on it!  Our dessert came out closer to chilled than room temperature, even though I prefer warm.  We loved our waiter so much, we didn't want him to know so we kept it!  If love red meat, order it at Block and Grinder and you'll be pleased, but the small plates and desserts need some work!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to go to the Block & Grinder since it opened and we heard some great things.  Overall the food was 4-5 stars, but the atmosphere and service was 2 stars.  In terms of service, we sat down in a cramped space next to a large table, and did not have a waiter assigned to us.  After 12 minutes, we finally had a waiter (who was very nice) notice that no one was assigned to us.  From there, he took over, but he also had other large tables, so the service was slow.  On to the positive aspects....for an appetizer, we got the jar of pimento cheese and crackers, which was delicious, and probably the best pimento cheese we have had in our short time being exposed to pimento cheese.  We decided to order the ribs for an entree, which was a great choice.  They were lean and tender, and rank up there as one of the best ribs we have ever had.  I think we would come back here, but would attempt to go on a weeknight (or off-peak time), which would hopefully improve the service.  I would also love to try the cocktails."}
{"text":"Thanks, but no thanks.  Attended their brunch on a Sunday - service was slow on drinks, food from the kitchen came out on time and looked good, but plates were just put infant of anyone so we all ended up switching to who had what correctly on our own, we were rarely checked on and no water glasses refilled unless we asked (sometimes more than once), when it came time for the bill we waited what seemed like eternity for them to split the bill and return.   Food presentation was good, taste was alright, but i've had better.  Best tip about this place: The drinks and mimosas are awfully small for the cost I thought. Also, the entire front has blacked out cover (I'm guess for when it is raining or bad weather - which it was not that day - it was actually quite sunny) making it challenging in finding the actual entrance point."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. The classic house burger had more favor then I have ever experienced as a burger. My boyfriend and I definitely will be going back because we day dream about the burgers. He got a  spicy special burger and really enjoyed it. Also their cocktails are amazing !"}
