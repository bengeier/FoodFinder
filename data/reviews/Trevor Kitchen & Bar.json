{"text":"Chef Vallins redefines comfort food. A beautiful, intimate atmosphere that proudly displays everything Trevor has to offer is front and center only to the creative food. I'd recommend the Truffle Poutine, Pork Belly, and anything with Foie Gras or Demi Glace."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Trevor Kitchen & Bar last night as part of Winterlicious 2014 and it was delicious!!
I started with the salmon tartare, second was beef cheeks and third the creme brulee, and there's not one bad thing that I can say about them! Ok, the tartare was a bit creamy than I normally expect (I usually prefer my tartare straight up!) but the beef cheeks were tender, and the risotto that came with it, although a bit salty on its own, was perfect with the cheeks. Creme brulee was perfect, the wine (shiraz) was awesome, and I even had a lovely decaf coffee to cap off the meal. 
Service was great - our waitress was awesome, and the atmosphere was really cute and intimate. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stumbled into Trevor's after some promising research online. The place was very trendy and the bar menu and cocktails were outstanding. We can't comment on the full menu as we were just there for a light bite to eat and some cocktails, but what we did try was great! I personally would suggest the poutine with foie gras, hands down the best poutine I have ever had! If I ever find myself back in Toronto I would definitely consider returning to Trevor's!"}
{"text":"Whoever wrote this place is unpretentious clearly wasn't there on a Friday night. It is the height of pretentious, with half the crowd there just to be seen.

But this isn't about the patrons. Let's talk about food.

My complaint is that the menu tries soooo hard to be something beyond itself. Sure, you can be in love with foie gras, but does it need to be 1/4 of the menu?

And if you are going that heavy, maybe you can offset it with something a bit lighter. Hello, green salad? Anything would be nice to contrast the rich meats and oils that seem integral to every plate. A side of poutine? Sure, I'll just book an arterial cleaning with my heart surgeon for next month.

We honestly felt ill after eating here, and it was because of how overwhelmingly rich and heavy the meal was.

If that doesn't bother you, then bombs away - the food is legitimately good. More than a few innovative creations are on offer.

My last complaint would be value for money. It is definitely on the low end here, as plates are about 20% overpriced. To eat in a windowless, low-ceilinged basement, I expect more competitive prices."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday with a friend - Summerlicious menu. The food was fantastic! ambience is very cozy! highly recommend. Note (learned the hard way) their happy hour coctails special does not apply during summerlicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely Incredible! From the food, ambiance, and the waitstaff. I visited on the 2nd night of winterlicious 2016. We had a reservation and were seated promptly after arrival. We were given a seat at the bar. The bartender was great! He was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The menu was \"to die for\"! I had a rock shrimp tempura salad  (the Freakin best Ive ever had!) while my date had macaroni and cheese with bacon. We both had steak with truffle poutine. The steaks were cooked perfectly! Better than the Keg! A good size portion. We finished with creme brûlée. It was amazing. This place is a must try! I will definitely be back! I can't wait..."}
{"text":"My friend and I (14 of us and a baby) went there for a friends going away/birthday party and we enjoyed the place a lot. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The food was great - huge portion size for  a pre - fixé menu. Overall it was great ! Before the event - they called me a few times to confirm details and gave me options for the menu. I was so impressed by everything. Thank you Trevor for making our evening so enjoyable."}
{"text":"This was my winterlicious 2016 experience. If I could give it less then a one star I would. I was very dissatisfied with the service this year. We had reservations for 7:30 PM we got there five minutes early to check in while waiting for the remaining two people. The two others came right at 7:30 PM and the table for four was not ready, we waited about 10 to 15 minutes more while they set the table up for us. 

Service started out pretty normally the waiter came and took our drink order and then came back to take the remaining orders for dinner. It took some time for the drinks to arrive and maybe 30-40 mins of having placed our orders, we received our appetizers. After finishing our appitizers we waited for another 40-50 mins for our entrees. 

During the wait, my boyfriend politely asked when our entree would be coming out as it already been hr since we were seated. The server was extremely rude and replied back with \"it's been 15 mins since I cleared your table from appetizers\". It was longer than 15 mins. 

So finally, out the entrees came. I got the crispy duck confit it was good overall, but I noticed that the skin was over cooked and was very dry. I know it is suppose to be crispy but it was hard to chew. My boyfriend got the steak frites and was very happy with the goat cheese poutine and the steak itself. My sister got the duck confit and she said hers came out great. My other friend got the beef cheeks risotto and he said that the beef cheeks were not warm and felt cold. 

We ate that and the wait for dessert was not too bad. The server comes back to collect the dessert dishes and that was when we asked for the bill. I, myself had not check the time through dinner but we started from 7:30 PM and ended up leaving at 10:15 PM due to the horrible and slow service. We waited more than 35 mins for the bill and once it came the sever did not bring us any cotton candy as that was something that I previously enjoyed the last time I was here. I told my friends about it and they were looking forward to the cotton candy experience. It was past 10 PM and we were tired of waiting for the machine, so we walked to the bar to pay. 

I can't believe I had such a horrible experience this year as I was here last year and I loved the food, the waiting staff was great and the overall experience was outstanding. That was the reason why I decided to come back this year again. After yesterday, I will not come back or recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here before twice and it was pretty decent. Nothing crazy but worth it. After seeing Trevor is one of the few places in Toronto to offer a deep dish pizza I jumped at the chance to try it.

Advertised as a walk in,  I ordered the sausage cheese tomato pie. The girl on the phone told me it would be about 20min. That was the first red flag. From my experience a deep dish pizza will take about an hour to bake.

Whatever maybe they have a super over I told my self.

If youre thinking of trying this for yourself DONT.

All the ingredients of the pie were seperated inside of it. The inch thick layer of sausage didnt stick to the crust and the cheese didnt stick to the inch thick layer of sausage. The taste was somewhat bland and to be honest the best thing about this monster was the way it looked."}
{"text":"Trevor has a huge potential but It doesn't yet delivery to the maximum they can. I like the place, the food and the service... but whatever they did... it wasnt just perfect. they make mistake in the order (kindly fixed it), the place was a bit smelly and not well air conditioned, but still.. it has some spark in it... which you cant ignore... i expected more for such an amazing owner and chef ... but didnt get the right return for my investment..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. No complaints. I would highly recommend the restaurant.

Our waitress advised me they were out of the wine I ordered (shiraz) - so we agreed on another wine (merlot). When my wine came, I was completely surprised at how light the wine was.. really was confused as it didnt seem at all like a merlot.

When it came time for glass #2 to be served, our waitress told me that my first glass was really the first wine I wanted - the shiraz - so my next wine that was already on the table would be the wine we agreed on - the merlot. It would have been preferable if I could have had two glasses of the same wine rather than two completely different glasses of wine (shiraz and merlot..) It was a very odd experience.. Not the best service.

The atmosphere was great - amazing music."}
{"text":"I was thrown a surprise birthday party here a few years back and have enjoyed coming here for after work drinks, dinner and drinks or just because drinks.  Happy Hour is where it's at!
 I really enjoy the quaint ambience and the food is very good as well. I didn't find it cheap or overly expensive. The atmosphere takes the edge off of a long day and the staff has always been helpful and friendly. Check it out! Interesting menu."}
{"text":"Took my fiancé here for his birthday and reserved for the sample tasting menu at the chefs table. It was an amazing experience, they made his birthday not just memorable but a new adventure. I've had several sample tasting menu's before but this is my fiancés first ever tasting menu. They accommodated my special requests and also asked for any food allergies in advance to eliminate a bad tasting menu experience. Every single entrée was paired with a particular wine picked by the chef and recited the ingredients for the delectable food we're eating. My fiancé is not fond of seafood but ended up liking their appetizer of pickled watermelon and spanish white anchovy. Also that BLT consommé is so scrumptious, I would've slurped that all evening. Also the food & wine pairing was great it just added the \"zing\" to your taste."}
{"text":"The brunch is WAY overpriced and very, very underwhelming. I ordered the frittata which was the oddest texture and came with a boring, underdressed kale salad. The side of bacon was the highlight by bar. Our server was lovely though!"}
{"text":"Lunch is definitely overpriced for the quality and service.
Especially when one of the waitresses felt kinda rude,
doesn't pay much attention at work and forgets what you have asked right after.
Not good for groups as they won't do separate bills,
and won't tell you about it nicely."}
{"text":"I went to Trevor last night for Winterlicious 2014. We were a party of 6. 
Given the waiting time (despite booking a table in advance) the manager offered the first round of drinks. In short, food was very delicious, drinks excellent but service was a bit lacking. 
FOOD
We tried several dishes from the fixed menu. The octopus and chorizo spaghetti were very tasting and succulent, the kobe beef carpaccio was fresh and mouthwatering. I got the duck confit as main dish. It was perfectly cooked, the skin was very crispy. Finally, the sorbet trio was the perfect combination of flavors: mango, strawberry and passion fruit (the best). At the end of the dinner, we got cotton candy! Yes, cotton candy! It was like going back in time. 
DRINK
The Bourbon Street cocktail was different than expected: too sweet and it tasted like soda. 
The Julep Noir cocktail is also based on Bourbon, tangy and minty. If you like cocktails on the bitter side, that's a good choice. 
SERVICE 
Service can be improved. I understand it was a crazy Winterlicious Saturday night but we never had \"our\" server. Only at the end the one of the bartender took care of us (she was very nice). We were supposed to receive a table but after a misunderstanding on the reservation (my foult) we were offered to seat in the lounge, to avoid waiting more than 1 hour, we accepted but they didn't tell us the the lounge table was a low table with couches. It was cozy but a bit uncomfortable to eat. 
OVERALL
Great restaurant with very good food and drinks, cozy environment. Service was ok."}
{"text":"We went to Trevor's last night for Winterlicious 2014 and it was great!! Creative cocktails, delicious food and great service.  The baby kale salad app is to die for - I'm still thinking about it! The complimentary candy floss was a nice added bonus to dessert. 

We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had a lovely dinner experience at Trevor. We sat at the \"Chef's Table\" - which is essentially inside the kitchen. Normally they use that table for tasting menus, but the table was available and so they let us have it to order off the menu. Thanks!

Our server was helpful and friendly - when we discovered the amount of foie gras on the menu (not our favorite flavour sensation), and the fact that we were all interested in the mac & cheese (sans foie gras) he was quick to point out that we could order a larger bowl to share from the bar menu WITHOUT foie gras! Yay!

We ordered the goat cheese poutine, mac & cheese and sliders to start. All were fantastic. Poutine had a great flavour, and even though I don't love goat cheese I was a big fan. We were all scavenging for the last few bites of mac & cheese.

As for mains, I had the roast chicken which was actually falling off the bone. I don't usually like eating the skin, but it was so crispy and delicious to discard. My friends ordered the white fish, shrimp & lobster spagetini and the pork belly. All were fantastic.

With the bill came a big bowl of cotton candy. Nice way to round out a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food! Fancy and romantic so save for a nice night out -spaghetti with lobster is my go-to along with the goat cheese and duck poutine-highly recommend! Trevor is in my top 10 in TO. Tip: don't go in the summer & wait until its cold t enjoy the comfy candlelit basement"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Thursday night.
Food here was good, but not amazing.
Our server was very nice, though.
The only complaint I really have is the hostess; she completely ignored us for a while and when she did approach, she wasn't very nice- almost bordering on rude.
But overall, I'd probably come back to Trevor's."}
{"text":"I've been going to Trevor Kitchen and Bar for after work drinks, and special occasion dinners for the past 3 years and have not yet had an unpleasant experience. The staff has always been cheerful and positive, and always makes my guests and I feel welcome - whether we're there for cocktails, dinner, or Winterlicious (when service can be abysmal). The macaroni and cheese is always to die for, and my steaks have yet to be anything but cooked to perfection. Also pleasant is the innovative use of seasonal ingredients: turnip risotto anyone?

Why Trevor Kitchen and Bar gets five stars:
1. They always call to confirm reservations
2. Their creative cocktail list
3. Their friendly, accommodating service.
4. The mushrooms under the stairs"}
{"text":"This review is only based on their happy hour and the ambiance since I did not sit down for a meal.

Happy hour from 5 to 7, only bottled beers are $3 and the cocktails they refer to are mixes of gin and tonic, vodka cranberry and etc. Surprised to find the restaurant in the basement, I personally don't like that.. which usually results in lower ceiling. Add candle light and it felt like dungeon. Had the goat cheese truffle oil poutine and the sliders that were also on half price special during happy hour, didn't really care for any of them. 

Grabbed a beer and walked next door to Pravda vodka bar. Glad I checked it out but probably won't go back!"}
{"text":"SUMMERLICIOUS 2015 REVIEW

We had a group of 10 people with a reservation for 8pm. We arrived on time and were told by the host that our table would be \"ready shortly.\" We weren't seated until close to 9pm. They brought us free shots to apologize for the wait, but some bread or something to nibble on would have been a better choice. I had the macaroni with ham and bacon crumble as my app and it was genuinely really good. I heard good things around the table about the other apps as well. At close to 10pm, we were still waiting to be served the entrees - which were A MESS. I ordered \"beef short ribs shrimp & bacon ravioli coconut curry emulsion\" (word for word from the menu). What I got was a beef brisket (no bone) on rice with a lone shrimp sitting awkwardly on top. No sauce to be found. I understand needing to make substitutions from time to time, but you have to LET ME KNOW. The presentation was terrible and the food itself was bland (and not at all what I ordered). Other entrees were equally disappointing and the service quickly went downhill. The desserts were fine, not fantastic or awful. Yes, we got the cotton candy with the bill like everyone else.. but who wants to eat a ball of sugar after just having dessert? 

This place might be nice on a regular night, but they haven't figured out how to handle Summerlicious yet, especially for large groups. Go back to the list of restaurants and pick somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This review is for the summerlicious menu.

The restaurant and overall decor and vibe of this place is nice.  The service was good, no complaints.  The food served with the summerlicious menu was just okay - I wouldn't go back for this menu.  I ordered the chicken tacos to start and was expecting shredded chicken instead it was canned flaked chicken.  For my main I ordered the white fish - this was done well, really light tasting.. fair size.  For dessert I had the sorbet - you get 3 flavours; mango, raspberry and blood orange.  At the end, you get a huge cotton candy ball which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I heart Trevor's Kitchen! Must try the Mac and Cheese. I'm kind of cheap so I mostly come when it's Summerlicious, but its definitely worth it to visit outside of that promotion. You also get a tasty ball of cotton candy at the end of your meal!"}
{"text":"We were in town from Buffalo so wanted to try something for Winterlicious. So this was the place we decided. The décor and over all feel of the place was very nice. We did not have reservations and told it would be about 20 - 30 min wait for a table so we had a few drinks at the bar. about 45 mins go by and we still did not have a table. I ask the bar tender to check on it and she did and she said shortly. Needless to say we had our table in about 5 min and a free shot because we waited so long, so that was nice.
I had the mac and cheese which was amazing but a very small portion. I also had the pork chop which was amazing. Cooked to perfection and a huge portion at that. For desert I had the espresso chocolate mousse which was to die for!!
Needless to say its defiantly worth a try. The service it great as well, but it seams as if they are trying to rush you out the door once you sit. But we were in a rush any way."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the 2014 Winterlicious menu.

However, I remember my experience quite well.

My best friend and I wanted to come here to try something new and to catch up.

The decor of the restaurant is very lovely.  It's located downstairs.  Ideally I think this place would be good for after work drinks.  However, instead we decided to try it out for winterlicious.

Food:
I had ordered the Spicy Wagyu Tartar - this consist of coriander, peanut, soy lime dressing and taro chips.  Taro chips were a perfect pairing with the well seasoned tartar.  

For main, I had the 8oz AAA sirloin steak garnish with winter truffle mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts and bacon.  For a person who loves their steak, this is probably one of the worse steaks I have had.  It was ridiculously chewy to the point that my jaw was tired from chewing it. 

I was not sure what went wrong, whether it was just the cut or what.  However, I had never experience such a chewy piece of steak. 

I had ordered the warm & crispy white chocolate cheesecake, which still leaves me remembering I was not fond of.

Maybe this was just not my cup of tea.  However, if it weren't for the tartar and the nice atmosphere, I definitely do not think I would give this place such a high rating."}
{"text":"This review is from summer 2011:

One of the few places I eat at consistently.  Why?  It's definitely not their toilets (stinkymagoo).  It's everything else.  I love it.  It's always good.  So I'm telling you again.  Pay attention.

It doesn't matter when I go to Trevor - weekend, weekday, holiday, winter, summer, three years ago, a month a go, or two days in a row.  It is always good.  That is pretty darn special.

This is what I had yesterday:

Ahi Tuna Niçoise - Think deconstructed...
Note that the tomato sauce ruined it for me. 

My friend Cracker had:
 
Slow roasted pork belly...*%&#@@#
And I could eat that octopus all day and all night
I almost licked Cracker's plate... 

Cracker won.  Not that it was a competition.  We finished dinner with tea for her and dessert for me.  It deserved a double Celine chest pump.  Mmmm....peanut butter chantilly...I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER (but not jelly, in case you were wondering).

Sh*t, can I get another with a side of the pork crackelin.  THAT would be soooo dirrrtyyy.  Food for thought.


This review is from summer 2010: 

Trevor is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto because it always delivers, the food at least. The service can be hit or miss. For some reason I always get stuck with the girl who hates her job, but loves herself.  I find her so insignificant compared to the food so I always go back.  

Since it opened in the fall of 2006, I have dined there about a dozen times, and popped in for drinks a handful more. The basement venue is dimly lit and cozy. I would describe it as comfy-chic.

Trevor is a more affordable and trendy dining alternative.  Two of my favourite things are the truffle goat cheese poutine and the trio of mini kobe burgers with garlic truffle mayo. Truffles are decadent and earthy and, if used wisely, an indulgent addition to a dish. 

Trevor also has several foie gras selections. 

Here's one from 2008. I don't remember exactly what it was, but to this day it is one of my fondest memories. I believe that's a berry jelly or compote of sorts, and I'm pretty sure that's pork belly under there. 

I'm also not chocolate's greatest fan, but Trevor has a dark chocolate peanut butter cake that is ridiculously good. No words do it justice.

I never count calories when I eat here. My favourite person to go with is my friend Saltine - you first met her when I celebrated the start of summer with her at Torito.  I'd describe her as a trendy artsy type who has a sophisticated eye and classy palate. Her appreciation for good food parallels mine - we don't skim on carbs or worry about fat content. The focus is on keeping our stomachs happy and Trevor does just that."}
{"text":"Summerlicious? More like Summervicious at Trevor's Kitchen 
July 15th, 2010

Monisa Tang 

Is disrespecting your clients, not caring about their dining experience, late seating despite reservation and rude, arrogant attitudes from the chef a sign that the restaurant is doing so well they don't need more business? If so, then Trevor's Kitchen & Wine Bar on Wellington is doing very well.

Every Summerlicious, a group of my high school girlfriends and I take advantage to have a reunion and catch up. Being a large group of 8, it is difficult to find a time when all can be present. After sorting through the endless restaurant options, I had vouched for Trevor's Kitchen and booked a late dinner at 8:30PM- since this was the only timeslot they had left. 

I am now embarrassed for making this selection.

We arrive promptly at 8:30 to be told that our table was occupied and the party was taking longer than expected. Only when we searched for a server and asked did we receive glasses of water during our 30 minute wait. 9PM hits and we were suddenly told our table was ready despite the fact that it was evident there had not been a party of 8 that left.

The server led us through the restaurant and to my surprise, into the back where the kitchen was. We were seated at a table snugly fit for 8 ('snug' being a generous description) directly in front of the kitchen. Immediately the temperature rose significantly as perspiration beads began to form on the faces on my lovely dressed ladies. One girlfriend sadly requested the seat next to the large white plastic fan stuck in the corner of the table. 

As we hesitantly sat down, I wondered if this was an actual dining table since it felt more like the staff dining area. I did not hear my friends asking the very question as the shouting of orders and banging of dishes and pots took over. 

At that table and in that moment, Trevor's Kitchen was no longer the fine dining experience they claim to be. In fact, it had a very suspicious resemblance to Lick's Burgers.

We politely asked how much longer it would be if we wanted to wait for the original table in the actual dining area (where I did not have to use the serviette to wipe up sweat). The server was equally as polite and said she would check. She swiftly turns to ask a man in a chef uniform which she addressed as Trevor. 

\"This is perfect,\" I say to my friends \"It's the chef! He must be able to ensure we have a good dining experience\". 

\"No more tables! You can wait till 10:30, 11 if you want but no more tables!\" was the yelling response from Trevor. 

(Although they later claimed that the table was a sought after dining spot as to be closer to the chef, this chef could not even turn around to tell us his response face to face but had the server relay the message.)

I piped in and asked if they can check if our original table was available now and suggested that we wait in the bar.

At this point, the arrogant Trevor turned to face me and repeated \"You can wait till 11 if you want. You can sit here or you can just go.\"

Shocked, angered and humiliated (since I picked the restaurant), I indicated to my friends we were leaving.  However, to secure the booking, Trevor's Kitchen had charged the full bill ahead of time (in this case, it was $35 x 8).  My friend reminded me of this so I turned back to Trevor and the server to ask about our refund.  The curt response was: \"We're too busy to do that now, we will get to it later tonight. Call back to confirm.\".

Only when I approached the server to express my anger did he show slight remorse and made a meek attempt to apologize on the chef's behalf.  The hostess demonstrated the first signs of customer service since I walked into the restaurant and offered us seating at the bar and free appetizers if we stayed.  With as much control as I could muster, I declined the offer and simply asked that she confirm the refund will be processed tonight. 

I am appalled by how restaurants and staff feel it is acceptable to treat their clients with such disrespect.  Understanding it is Summerlicious and a hectic time for restaurants, I do not expect exceptional service (which I really should not even accommodate to) but when staff is plain RUDE, it is absolutely unacceptable.  If I am expected to tip after a dining experience, I expect standard customer service in return. 

Luckily we were close enough to walk down the street to Biffs Bistro, who were accommodating and served absolutely delectable French cuisine.  The staff was empathetic of our experience, was delightful to chat with and went above and beyond to ensure our night was salvaged. 

So congratulations Trevor's Kitchen for leaving me with such a notorious impression of your staff and encouraging me to write about this experience and spread it like wildfire. In a time where social media and networking is so prevalent, I have no doubt that I will be successful."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious for the second time and it was awesome. We were a bit early so we had some drinks at the bar. We tried the champagne cocktails and they really hit you but I don't think I'd get them again. They came to get us after and we asked the waiter for sangria which wasn't on the menu, but he made it for us, and it was delish. This time they didn't serve us bread, but my meal was pretty filling. I had the mac n cheese, the braised beef cheeks, and the cookies n creme tiramisu. Everything was so good and the portion size was perfect. I noticed the mac n cheese was smaller than last time and the dessert was bigger. No complaints though. They finished with a huge bowl of cotton candy. It is honestly my FAV place for Winterlicious and definitely think everyone should go. There's so many options for people's tastes."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great dining experience. Taking simple and sometimes unique  ingredients and turning them into a tasteful delight. I had the pan seared trout. One of the better ones that I have tasted. Portion sizes were just right, leaving you full but not un-comfortably stuffed. The staff was very friendly, and accommodating. I will surely visit Trevor Kitchen and Bar again."}
{"text":"I went to Trevor last night with a group of 4. Our table was ready right away. We all loved the ambience. Dim lights, low ceilings-- very romantic. 

Our server was fabulous.  She seemed genuinely eager to please, and was very helpful in making menu recommendations. 

The food is AMAZING!!!! we had:
Appetizer:
Seared tuna - this was done very rare with a light batter around it. We all loved this dish. The salad it came with was also very good. 

Seared Foie gras - The menu has a Foie gras section, we HAD to try one. This dish came with blueberry pancakes and syrup and the flavour combination was heavenly! It was very rich. The 4 of us shared it. 

Mains: 
Beef Cheeks - I am obsessed with this dish! tender beef cheeks and creamy risotto topped with foie gras. It is crazy good but super rich. I had it once and split it with three people. I didn't have it last night, but I HIGHLY recommend this dish, just know what you are in for. 5 star dish

Lamb shank - this was incredibly tender and served with smooth mashed potatoes. I felt it was a bit under seasoned but it was still quite good. I give it 3 stars. 

Venison - WOW 5 star dish! This was INSANE. We had it medium rare, and I felt it was was a bit rare, but it was delish! We all loved it. 

The beef tenderloin - I had a bite of my friend's it was incredibly tender. 

Sides: 
Poutine with truffle oil and goat cheese - it was as good as it sounds

Crispy cauliflower - battered cauliflower. Worth every calorie.

Desert:
Macaroons - these were SUPER SWEET with a very generous amount of filling. It wasn't for me. But it you like really really sweet, then go for it.  

They had run out of milk, so we couldn't have lattes, but all in all my experience at Trevor last night was almost perfect. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you have a lot of money to waste and would like to be treated with \" I am too good for  you \" attitude. This is the place to go. So many better places to enjoy your evening enjoy better food. Don't degrade yourself by going there. Neg. stars."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Round 2, and it was just okay.  Based on the menu, I was super excited for Trevor Kitchen and Bar.  Between scallops and duck, steak and foie gras poutine, chocolate and peanut butter - what could go wrong?  

The experience started off well enough.  We were greeted at the door by a girl who informed us that we were at a \"Summerlicious Hot Spot\", so we'd be getting a free coffee or tea with our meal.  If we paid with American Express, then we'd get a $20 restaurant coupon - I really wished one of us had an AMEX at that point.  Oh well, any freebie is good by me!  

The restaurant itself has a lot of character and ambiance.  The front seemed a little too dark (maybe from coming out of the sun?), but the area we were sat in was just dark enough.  Very romantic - too bad I was there with a girlfriend!  The décor definitely enhanced the experience.  

Our server was also fantastic.  I don't know what it was about him, but the word \"adorable\" kept coming to mind.  He sold us on the Summerlicious cocktail special (lychee and mint iced tea) and was very attentive when my friend asked for the vegetarian meal - he mentioned that her starter wasn't vegetarian but could be made that way if she preferred.  Being a \"part-time\" vegetarian, the bacon in her corn soup was okay by her, but the offer was appreciated.

Unfortunately, that's where the amazing ends and the just-okay begins.  First were the cocktails.  These weren't even okay.  They tasted like when the soda machine is running out of syrup, so the iced tea is really watered down...and then had a strange aftertaste of lychee.  I only got halfway through it, and same for my friend.  

The starter for me was the best part of the meal.  I can't complain about my scallop or the duck meat, both components were cooked perfectly and the sweet pee puree was a nice accent.  The only disappointment was that I only got one scallop.  My friend's corn soup was apparently overpoweringly onion-y.  

Then the mains came out.  From the description of \"dry aged sirloin with goat cheese poutine & foie gras butter\", I assumed that the foie gras butter would be on the poutine.  Wrong.  There was a pog-sized (channel your inner 90s child folks) piece of butter on top of my steak.  The steak itself was perfectly medium-rare and was very tasty, although I didn't really notice the flavour of the foie gras which was disappointing for my first experience with it.  As for the poutine, I was really looking forward to it because I love goat cheese.  It was pretty good, but for using such a dry cheese, I really wish that they'd been more generous with the gravy.  My friend ordered the ratatouille and stated that it was to food what the cocktails were to drinks.  Translation: not a lot of flavour.  She did opt to take it home though (it was a very generous portion), noting that she would be adding salt.

Finally, the desserts.  I ordered the amazing sounding dark chocolate & caramel torte with peanut butter chantilly, and my friend the strawberry tiramisu.  Again, not what I had expected.  The shape of my torte was vaguely reminiscent of a poached egg, but a little rounder on top.  There wasn't a lot of caramel sauce, but it was there so can't call fault.  While heavy, I didn't find the torte to be particularly rich.  When I go for chocolate cake, which isn't that often, I want richness and depth of flavour.  I didn't feel like I got that.  The peanut butter chantilly on the side was the best part.  The strawberry tiramisu, which sounds so light and airy, was apparently dense and heavy - even the strawberry mousse was heavy.  

All in all, lovely décor, great service, but the food was just okay.  Maybe it's the common complaint that restaurants don't put in the effort for summerlicious...but to me that's not a good enough argument, because I go to Summerlicious to try restaurants and see if I would be willing to spend the money on their regular menu.  Had I been paying regular price for these items, I would have been a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Winterlicious round... Oh I lost count!  Have always been a fan of Trevor Kitchen & Bar.  This is my third time dining here.

I must say that I must lower my initial review of the restaurant as the food seemed uncharacteristic and out of the norm.  I've always had great food at Trevor, but something just wasn't right today.

First and foremost, they get points deducted because they ran out of one of the dishes being offered on the menu - the Port Braised Beef Cheeks with Sunchoke Risotto.  To me, that is just bad logistics planning, and it reflects badly on the management of the restaurant.  

We ordered the following items to start:
Shaved winter vegetable salad with arugula, spiced pecans & pomegranate molasses 
-and-
Asiago Mac 'n Cheese

The salad I've had in the past, and it is really good!  The spiced pecans have a nice crunch and sweetness to them, the arugula and beets are very fresh, and the pomegranate molasses is what really makes this dish shine.  

The Asiago Mac 'n Cheese was topped with fried panko breadcrumbs... Deviating from the traditional, and sometimes boring, plain breadcrumbs, really makes this dish interesting.  The dish was just oozing of cheese, and I got caught with a \"stringy-cheese-hanging-from-your-lip\" moment (thank God I wasn't on a date!)  I am personally a cheese-lover, and I like stronger cheeses... However, for those of you who are faint at heart and prefer milder cheeses, you may find the Asiago to be too overpowering for your tastebuds.

On to our mains... After the initial disappointment that the beef cheeks were sold out, we opted for the Chicken Confit and the Fish Sticks & Chips.  The Chicken Confit was tender, and was reminiscent of a pulled pork. The meat came off in shreds, and was moist.  However, it still doesn't beat the \"melt-off-the-bone\" goodness of a DUCK confit.  It was served with a buttermilk gravy (which I suspect had sweet potato in it, as the gravy had a hint of sweetness to it), and a potato pierogi.

The fish sticks and cheese was disappointing.  Deviating from using the traditional halibut, Trevor opted for cod.  The fish itself was nice and flaky, neither under- nor overcooked.  The batter itself was bland and boring, and really greasy!  The \"lobster\" tartare sauce that accompanied it was really bland as well.  All I could taste was lemon, and the \"lobster\" was lost in the sauce somewhere.  The fries redeemed this entire dish. It was bursting of intense potato flavour, they were neither too thick, nor too matchstick thin, neither too soft or too crunchy either - just right.  But seriously, if I wanted to just have fries, I would've gone to a poutine house!  

The desserts, however, made me forget all the initial disappointments from the appetizer to the main.  They were absolutely DIVINE!  We had the Cookies & Cream Tiramisu and the Dark Chocolate & Caramel Torte with Peanut Butter Chantilly.  I don't think that the tiramisu was properly named because there was nothing about it that screamed tiramisu.  It was a cookies and cream CAKE at best - but a very tasty one at that.  The cake batter was nice and fluffy, and the cream was really smooth and savory.  The texture of the Oreo cookies were soft and came together well with the cake.  If the cake were thicker or heavier, I think the cake would've been too heavy.  Kudos to Trevor for that!  If you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, you will LOVE the torte.  The cake was spongey-good and the chantilly cream was TO DIE FOR! R.I.P. Vonnie... x_x  

All in all, Trevor is a great restaurant, but I think I will be skipping it on my Winterlicious tour next year."}
{"text":"I've dined at here a few times and I have always enjoyed myself. I really like the sexy, dimly lit underground ambience. 

The food is absolutely divine. I highly recommend the beet salad -- it is exquisite! I've had the roasted chicken with macaroni & asiago cheese and it was cooked to perfection. Always leave room for dessert, as they are sinfully good. I thoroughly enjoyed the salted caramel creme brulee. 

Service is a little slow and could be friendlier."}
{"text":"Did Trevor's for Winterliscious on a Friday night. Place was packed but we didn't wait long for our reservations. This was my first time here and I would definitely return. Atmosphere was nice. 5/5. Good date spot as well a spot to go with some friends. Food was good. Not that memorable for me but still good. (I had the beef cheek.) What stuck out the most was the cotton candy that comes at the end of the meal. So original."}
{"text":"We had been here before (aug 2010), and had the best poutine I have ever had. On a return trip to Toronto, we stopped in this past Saturday January 29th, to grab some bar food before going to Pravda vodka bar two doors down. We did go in at a busy time, 7:45, sat at the bar. A few minutes before 8:00, we ordered drinks, poutine and some other appetizer. At 8:20 we asked for our food. Finally at 8:30 we gave up, paid for our drinks and left. I don't mind a busy restaurant, but please manage my expectations. All the food that was brought out to other customers at the bar looked great, I just wish I could have tasted some myself."}
{"text":"I was kind of expecting something a little less swanky, but pleasantly surprised descending the stairs to Trevor's mood lit bar and restaurant.

Having attempted to go here on Monday to find out they were closed (should've read the opening times beforehand), we stopped by here for a quick dinner tonight (Wednesday) immediately after work. A few people were already in attendance at the bar, but we were able to sit at a nearby table and ordered a few tasting plates to share with a glass of red each.

The fact that they've dedicated an entire section of the one page menu to foie gras dishes is commendable. The dishes are homemade made fancy with plates like Salt Cured Foie Gras club sandwich, macaroni and asiago cheese with seared foie gras and trio of mini Kobe burgers with an amazing truffle mayonnaise.

Our server for the evening seemed to be the only one in the restaurant, but it did not result in any kind of delay in our service. The food came out promptly and the presentation matched the amazing flavours of the dishes.

This certainly is a more up market venue than the name suggests, with our total for 3 appetiser plates which were shared and 2 glasses of wine coming to $100 including tip, but all-in-all well worth it.

A nice little surprise was post meal fairy floss which I've not had in ages. Almost as good as desserts containing pop rocks. Awesome."}
{"text":"Ill have to admit that this place at first glance looks like I just stepped into a sleek NYC Contemporary Lounge. As I looked over, I realized that the dining room was just as impressive. 
The restaurant sits below ground in the basement, and gives off a very masculine feel. The wine list is huge, and well represented by both the New and the Old World. The were mentioned in the 2008 Wine Spectators Award of Excellence Group. 
The one thing that did surprise me was that there were countless Foie Gras items on the appetizer list. I have never seen that before - maybe there's a fetish with the Chef??!! 
I had the grilled strip - which was cooked a bit too much. 
I should have gone for the Whisky Dinner which includes: 
Whisky marinated Foie Gras (of course it does!) 
Black Cod 
Ribeye Venison 
Whisky Cheddar 
Pecan Pie 
All courses are served with a shot of Whisky! Go figure. 
All and all it is a great experience, but I would like to try my luck at the Whisky menu next time around - YEEEEHAAA"}
{"text":"Winterlicious dinner event

If you ever order  steak.... cut it in half before eating it and check with your cell phone flash light to see if it was cooked properly.   Unfortunately I was given raw... Not even  close to medium rare meat.    I had them re-cook and still the middle section was raw.   I ate around it.   My fellow meat eater who likes rare meat even said it was too raw.


The other  dish we had  was  the ginger spicy chicken that was  sitting in a pool of congealed sauce. Mmmm, so yummy digging into a piece of chicken surrounded in its own fat.

Desert was a disappointment.   Given the choice of dish used.... Ideally you will cut apple into pieces versus slices... Especially since the only utensil provided was  a SPOON.... I would like to know  how  a normal person will  eat  this cobbler.... Some invisible chop stick or fork ???  You cannot cut the apples slices using the side of the spoon either

The good part of this event  was  the friends, Mac and cheese, waygau tartar, chocolate mouse, the waiter we were assigned,  and the surprise cotton candy 

To conclude, come for the appetizers,  chocolate mouse,  service and skip the main course.


Appetizer: 5/5

Main course: 0/5

Desert: 2/5   (points are for the cotton candy and chocolate mouse)

Service: 4.5/5

noise level: 2/5 (hard to hear our self talk)"}
{"text":"I went here for a work Christmas party after wayyy too many brews at the Bier Markt so my memory might be a little rough. 

However, I do remember Trevor being a lot of fun and the food being especially tasty. We sat down in the small lounge area at first and had some cocktails and appetizers. They had these mini hamburgers that were to die for and I remember the next day at the office everyone was still talking about them. 

The restaurant itself is set in a basement but the area sprawls into several different seating areas. The restaurant feels very historic and brooding with lots of soft lighting. We sat in our own private nook, which makes it great for private functions. 

The food was spectacular. I started with a lobster dish that was absolutely delicious. For my main course I had a tenderloin and whipped potatoes and they were both so tasty and filling. In fact everyone at my table raved about their food the whole night. For dessert I had some kind of dark chocolate ganache that I couldn't even finish because I was so stuffed from all the food (and booze). 

The prices at Trevor are in line with most fine dining establishments, so it won't be a cheap date. However, their summerlicious/winterlicious menus feature some tasty meals and won't cost you quite as much. I highly recommend this restaurant for a nice date or anniversary!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my partner.  We live in the neighborhood but I've never been before.  We went with the summerlious menus.  It was amazing.  Everything was spot on.  
The appetizers can in the right size and portion leaving enough space for the generous mains.  I had the pork chop,  it was amazing,  tender,  and juicy.  
The dessert was the best finish for an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and I expect to go back for many more times as well! The food is amazing and the ambiance is very nice. The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is that it's down in the basement, and the stairs can be a bit too dark so whenever I go in, I'm always scare of tripping and fall on my face. Once you get through the hurdle, you'll be eat the restaurant and be lead to your table to enjoy their wonderful menu of all the delicious food they have to offer. 

The menu changes throughout the year, so I have many many favorites and you the next time I go back, I can't always order the same thing again. One of the dish that's always on the menu, and that I love love is the foie gras poutine. OMG.. soooo delicious! They used to give you a whole big piece of fois gras that's the size of your hands for the poutine though, but ever since last year, the piece of foie gras has gotten smaller, maybe the size of your palm.. but still, it's plenty enough for you to have for every bit of the dish. 

They also have a very good wine selection, so I encourage you to try it out the next time you are there. I am not too knowledgeable with my wine, so I always ask for the waiter to recommend something to me and I'm never disappointed!

I also love that they give you cotton candy at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Very nice. Great dining experience and service. Desserts were excellent."}
{"text":"Came for the lounge food and it was mostly hits. Everyone enjoyed the pulled pork. I really liked the mac and cheese. It was well made comfort food."}
{"text":"Trevor is a modern, unpretentious, and chic restaurant, hidden away near the St. Lawrence Market, offering a dim-litted and romantic dining experience. Service was impeccable, friendly and knowledgeable, recommending several popular dishes when the choices are many.

Ordered: 
Rutabaga tortellini - I didn't know what to expect with this, but it came with two tortelli over pieces of ham hock. The rutabaga filling had a creamy texture; and when combined with the saltiness of the ham hock, it was the perfect complexity. It was delicious and made me want more.

Seared foie gras - This came with buttermilk pancakes, smoked pork belly and spiced apple puree. There was so much going at once, I didn't know where to start. The seared foie gras itself was just as I imagined, creamy texture with fatty side to it. The smoked pork belly had a sweet taste to it, and worked really well with the foie gras. 

Port braised beef cheeks - Probably the less exciting dish of the evening. The risotto was rich and creamy. The braised beef cheeks was tender, smooth and had the right balance of fat. Though it wouldn't be something I would order again. 

Chocolate rice pudding - It came with burnt marshmallow, smoked caramel and graham cracker gelato. I felt it was a deconstruction of s'mores into its elements. The chocolate rice pudding had a gooey richness, and when combined with the gelato and graham cracker, it was delectable. Definitely made to share, though it was something I didn't exactly want to do after that first bite. It wasn't a heavy dessert and it was a great way to end a delicious meal.

Definitely at must-return restaurant for me. 

Note: As Trevor isn't opened on Sunday, make sure you make reservations when going on a Friday or Saturday night. They're usually booked!"}
{"text":"Trevor!.....im pleased with your Kitchen and Bar! 
just a few doors from Pravda Vodka bar, Trevor Kitchen and Bar sits among a row of lovely restaurants nestled in the St Lawrence Market area of T.O. As the make your way down the stairs to the venue, you can't help but notice the reflection of yourself with the oversized mirror lol... nonetheless the place is dim, and cozy.  Whether you're here for drinks, intimate dinner, or a quiet night on the town this is among one of the nicer places.  If I could change one thing, it would be the music genre, it didn't suite the venue at all.  
The food and service was top notch!! and we luckily found a great spot in the confinments of their cozy couches.  
Food:  
Kobe Beef sliders!! 5/5 presentation (with the pickle on top), flavor, and tenderness was bang on!!
Crispy Roasted Cauliflour: 4/5 roasted, and deep fried cauliflour is pure delish, served with a lemon garlic mayo.  Great dish to share as their portion is sufficient.  Only drawback= too much salt..other than that it would have been a 5/5
Sushi Pizza: 5/5 First time trying this, and I was amazed! 
.......
........... for drinks I had their fontezoppa 2009 montepulciano d'abruzzo... yum..


Trevor, I;ll be back!"}
{"text":"My Girlie Yelper Susan suggested that I post up this note I received in response to my review of Trevor Kitchen & Bar.  Now I wondered who could have possibly written this.....hmmmm.....it was sent to me by carolyn b. (all lower case) and she has no reviews, posts etc.  Here you go, read for yourself....


when you get a clue about food, feel free to write a review.
you are so amateur it's hilarious.
you brought your own wine b/c you were TOO CHEAP to order off the wine list. that's why the server looked down on you. she already knew the tip that 2 cheap women would leave.
people like you are the REASON for summerlicious--CHEAPNESS.
Suck it up buttercup.

There you have it folks."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place b/c the Korean place we wanted to go to next door was full.  I'm so glad we tried it because the food is amazing. We started with the seared foie gras that came with three mini buttermilk pancakes that were made just right (light and fluffy with a little crunch on the outside).  It was layered with a piece of bacon that just added so much flavour to it, and it came with this perfectly paired plum sauce.

I ordered the beef cheek and it's OMG delicious.  It literally melted in my mouth and was so infused with flavour.  It was served on a bed of risotto that was made with beef stock so was a perfect compliment.  My date had the duck confit that I got a few bites of.  The skin had the perfect crunch and a nice salty flavour.  It came with a pouched-like egg that was not at all runny.  She originally was going to skip it b/c it looked raw but the waiter came by and said it takes them a good 30 minutes to make so she tried it.  It was really delicious.

To top off the evening they brought us a complementary bowl of cotton candy.  We thought that was so whimsical and so impressionable.  We picked at it because we were so full.  All in all this was a great place.  I will definitely be back for more of that melt-like-butter beef cheek."}
{"text":"I like this resto and it's location.  The decor is nice, although the floors are a bit crooked with lower ceilings in some parts.  But the food it delish!

Worth a visit, and great for a girls night out or even a date night!"}
{"text":"This review is for  summerlicious 2015.

Went to Trevor's this past Saturday evening with a group of friends(about 12) . We got there a little early but we're pleasantly greeted to have a few drinks at the bar while our party arrived . 

The atmosphere was great! Dark, deep woods lit with candle light . Very urban chic. 

We all ordered off the  summerlicious menu(35 for 3 courses)I had the chipotle  lime tacos as my starter. They came in a petite size, perfect for an appetizer. Over all they were good but nothing too special. I than had the pork chop. It was very large and came with a sage waffle with a side of veggies.The presentation was fantastic but yet again lacked a little flavour. Now the dessert was amazing ! Strawberry tiramisu was delicious. Hands down the best course of the night.  We were surprised with a cotton candy as we received our bill. A very nice way to end the night . 

Overall we had a great time and experience. Great friends and great service always makes up for okay food. Definitely worth trying especially for summerlicious."}
{"text":"Admittedly, the only times I've been here were for the Winterlicious promotion, so it may not reflect its full talents.  This notwithstanding:

Last year, my group and I were seated at the Chef's Table.  Service was attentive, and we were able to interact with the kitchen staff - who, while busy, remained professional and eager to please.  The Mac N Cheese was wildly popular with our group - it was well-prepared, al-dente, with enough depth of flavour to make our mouths water for more.  Their beef cheeks were excellently prepared and paired with a tender risotto.  The crème brulée, while served in a shallow dish and therefore lacking in the warm brulée-d top contrasting the cool cream below, was still tasty.

This year, I tried something different.  No longer seated at the chef's table, my group was well-serviced by our waiter and we were quite content with the attentiveness of staff.  My food, however, left something to be desired.  The shrimp and bacon ravioli was well-prepared and fresh, but the sauce was lacking entirely, making the entire dish rather bland.  A tenderloin of beef was adequately prepared at medium-rare, however, it appeared roasted - the telltale juices draining from the meat as time passed.  The texture had lost its softness and the outer portions came across gritty and the whole cut was unseasoned.  By contrast, the duck poutine was oversalted (it's poutine, I know), but the fries were fresh enough and the cheese tasty enough and I was hungry enough that it didn't much matter, by that point.

Dessert - a \"Cookies and creme\" thing - yes, thing - was inoffensive enough, but indeed, lacked in the cookie and the creme department - and I found myself spooning as much of the accompanying sauce into each bite as possible, begging for a bit of flavour.

Others in my group - who had ordered such items as the soup, the beef cheeks, and the chocolate and peanut butter dessert - had a much better sensory experience.  If you are to go to this place, stick to their specialities.  Otherwise, I wonder if I just caught someone on a rather uninspired night."}
{"text":"Ate here last night - service was great - and the food was something else - it was amazing!  We were a table of 3 and there was an order of arugula salad with shaved root vegetables that was abundant and flavorful.  A side order of the poutine fries with truffled goat cheese that was out of control goodness.  And with all the hoopla over their mac n' cheese, of course, I had the mac n' cheese with the foie gras (personally, not a huge foie gras fan so mine was put on a side plate and not on top of my mac n' cheese) and it came in such a small little bowl, I thought for sure I would have to order more food.  I was so wrong.  It was so filling.  And it was another meal out where the seasoning to the food was perfect - I didn't go home and drink a jug of water.  We had the creme brulee for dessert, which had cookies accompanying it on the side.  And the big finale - a surprise - a pink surprise - cotton candy!  Totally funny, unexpected and yet, so delicious and nostalgic.  I highly recommend this place and want to go back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Must have a been a bad night I got there, but I can still smell soot.

I was in a group of 8 people, all ordering apps, mains, and several pricey bottles of wine.  To begin, my seared foie gras appetiser appeared to me, but the interpretation was more like burnt than seared.   I don't usually send stuff back to the kitchen, but this was expensive and inedible.   It took about 10 minutes to get a replacement, which probably explains the degree of doneness.  The replacement was also burnt, so I just sliced off the sides and ate the rest.

The to the mains.  I ordered the crispy pork with octopus.   As I should have expected, the octopus was badly burnt.   I asked the waiter if anyone actually looked at the stuff before sending it out.  He took it back without a word.   He returned later and asked if everything else on the plate was ok, but I never actually got my replacement octopus.

Add to this crap food seriously lazy service - no wine refills, no real apologies, no inedible items taken off the bill, and a pre-added tip to boot, and suffice it to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious $35 dinner with three friends.

When I first walked into this basement restaurant, I thought the dining space looked nicer than I'd imagined but I was then led to the other side which was too dark and felt stuffy with the tables close together and couches beside us. 

We had bread to start which came at the same time as the appetizer. Generally all the food came really quickly. Bread was a cold thin baguette, pretty good with the butter.

Appetizer: Salmon Tartare 2/5
Presentation was messy and my scoop of fish was noticeably smaller than my friend's. It was mushy and had some mayo type sauce which I was not expecting for a tartare. Quite bland but better when eaten with the lettuce and olive spread for more flavor and texture. The chips on its own were good. Also for presentation, I feel like the plate was much too small to fit the food. 

On the other hand, my friend's beef carpaccio was better, even from tasting a small piece I could tell it was very thin and paired well with the garlic chip and mayo. 

Main: Port Braised Beef Cheeks with risotto 3/5
Beef cheeks were very soft and melt in your mouth. But I couldn't taste port, just overall salty. Risotto on the top was nice and creamy but the bottom portions soaked up all the salty oil from the beef. It's best to alternate bites of salty beef and creamy risotto to balance the flavors out. This dish is a bit one dimensional flavor, wish it had some veggies or something, could not taste rutabaga or sunchoke chips.

Dessert: Salted Caramel Creme Brûlée 3/5
Came in a shallow dish that resembles Korean appetizer/banchan dishes. I like the hard sugar coating on top, but the creme part is a bit too creamy for me. The cookie was really hard.. I think it was shortbread?

Best dessert was prob my friend's raspberry sorbet (which I didn't even notice on the menu!)

Service: not bad per se, but def expected better. Server didn't really smile, and another server did not know what she was serving us.

Overall, maybe it was my personal taste and choices, but I was expecting better.. nothing impressive with food, service or environment."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has an average of 3.5 stars... It's very clear the owners of this restaurant have given up and are about to pack up. DO NOT DINE HERE!

THE BAD

- Website: needs to be updated, menus are dated in 2014. Already a sign they don't give a $hit anymore.
- I made a phone reservation the day before at 5pm and felt rushed. The staff wasn't knowledgeable either. When asked if they had the foie gras tasting menu as advertised on their outdated website, he hesitantly said \"sure...\" and when I asked how much, he said \"I can't remember... around $35 or $40...\", which made no sense.
- When we actually got there, there was NO foie gras tasting menu, but you could replace one of the courses with foie gras for an extra $10.
- We arrived on a Saturday evening and the place was only 1/5 full. Very bad sign.
- Our waiter was not very attentive and definitely was not enthusiastic about the tasting menu option. We decided to go with that anyway to be \"adventurous\".
- We did NOT receive complimentary bread, even though other tables got it.
- Extremely slow food service - took 2.5 hours in an empty restaurant. After waiting forever for the third course, we wanted to get up and leave, but the better part of ourselves told us to hold on a bit longer...

THE FOOD = ALSO PART OF THE BAD

- We ordered the $55 Tasting Menu for 5 Courses, plus $10 extra to replace one of the dishes with foie gras... So really it was $65 for a 5-course meal. I guess this wasn't a fine dining tasting menu since the price was relatively \"cheaper\"... although in general, a Tasting Menu is supposed to be the chef's way of showcasing their skill and the best of their menu (or off menu)... In this case, our tasting menu was often what was the cheapest item on the menu. 
- Course #1: \"Spicy Chicken Littles\" - basically spicy BBQ chicken bites with blue cheese aioli; or as my boyfriend called it, gourmet chicken nuggets.
- Course #2: \"Pork & Pickle Slider\" - with bbq spice aioli; it was tasteless pork meat and a slight bit bigger than a slider should be. Again, my boyfriend called it a gourmet McDonalds experience. I think if we got a poutine next, we would've called it quits.
- Course #3: \"Pan Seared Foie Gras\" - with cranberry preserve and toasted crostini; we had to pay $10 extra to get this course instead of whatever they were planning to serve us. It was okay... but definitely the worst foie gras I've had, but still not bad. One of the foie gras pieces was stringy and cold in the centre though.
- Course #4: \"Maple Cured Pork Rib Chop\" - with yukon gold and sweet potato gratin, firs and crispy taro; I did not like the meat at all. It tasted like salty ham and the maple flavour really threw me off. There were only 4 strips of the meat anyway. The potato gratin was okay but a bit too cheesy.
- Course #5: \"Creme Brûlée\" - This was off menu and was decent at a good portion. It tasted exactly as it should have. 
- At the end, they bring every table a bowl of homemade cotton candy, which normally I would love but somehow this one was a bit overloaded with sugar (as if that was possible!)

THE GOOD

I would say the only good thing about this place (other than the decent creme brûlée) was the decor - it's got a nice atmosphere and has potential to be nice space (minus the slightly off music). Even better that it's in the Flat Iron District, so it's downtown, but quieter with cheaper parking, and nice lights outside at night time. 

STAY AWAY FROM HERE THOUGH! The chef, waiter, and owners clearly don't care about this place anymore.  Two days later when I walked by this restaurant again, I noticed the front door glass was smashed in :o("}
{"text":"**This 4 star is based on my Summerlicious experience.

One of the few places that offers a variety of items on its Summerlicious menu that attracts my taste buds.  Located on the Wellington strip, this basement establishment is simple, yet elegant.  No fancy decors or artwork, just some simple plants and lights, just dim enough to deliver the perfect ambience!  Romantic enough for a date, casual enough for a get-together with a group of friends, but classy enough so you wouldn't run into a bunch of teeny boppers throwing their 19th birthday there with tiaras.  Normally, it would take me years to decide what I like, but it just so happens that there were two dishes from each course that jumped out at us.

~APPS~
Potato-Crusted Crab Cake: 4/5 stars
I'm picky with crab cakes, but this batter was perfect and I can actually taste and see the crab! It could have been slightly hotter, but I guess that's what I have to sacrifice when I do Summerlicious.  It came out so fast that you know they have a batch in the back waiting to be dished out conveniently.

Macaroni & Asiago Cheese: 2.5 stars
Good. Nothing beyond that.  Small portion too, even for Sumerlicious.

~MAINS~
Surf and Turf: 4/5 stars
Sirloin with jumbo prawn served with truffled goat cheese poutine.  What wouldn't appeal to me in that dish?? Perfectly cooked steak and shrimp, delicious fries, and I love goat cheese!  The sauce was some sort of balsamic reduction which I thought was different, but tasty nonetheless.

Grilled Pork Chop: 3/5 stars
I don't care what the health board laws are, when I go out and get a pork chop at a restaurant with a good chef, I like my pork mid-well.  It's just that much juicier!  However, this was still good served with ancho chilli apple sauce, haricots verts, and red cabbage.  A slight twist on classic pairings!

~DESSERT~
Creme Brulee: 3/5 stars
You can't really go wrong with a classic vanilla bean creme brulee. Slightly under-settled for me... a bit runny, but still good.

Dark Chocolate and Caramel Torte: 4 stars
Served with... get ready... PEANUT BUTTER CHANTILLY! Who doesn't like peanut butter cream with chocolate? Slightly sweet for me, but I'm not really a dessert person.  But anyone who loves sweets, chocolate, and peanut butter will orgaz to this!

Service: 4 stars
Very attentive with servers and food runners.  A little lack in friendliness but oh hell, it's Summerlicious and it was busy... though a smile here and there wouldn't hurt.  Cutlery is changed after each course, and linen napkins will be refolded every time you come back from the bathroom.

Overall, great experience for the price of $35 pp.  Food was not amazing to taste, but delicious.  You can definitely tell that time and care was put into the cooking and prep of all the dishes."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious on a Saturday night. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant right away. Had green pea and ham soup for appetizer, duck confit for entree and creme brulee for dessert. All were fantastic! They offered complimentary bread at the beginning and cotton candy after dessert which was a nice touch. We brought our own wine for a corking fee of 29 dollars. Would try this place again."}
{"text":"Like. A lot.

Met a bartender in the healthcare field. We compared notes on Canadian vs. American healthcare.

Mac & cheese was a great amount of Gouda. Enjoyed it.

Cocktails classy & good.
Ok spot."}
{"text":"The food here is good.  Really good.  Our steaks were plump and cooked to perfection.  But the real standouts were the side dishes.  The buffalo cauliflower was unlike anything we've had before and literally had myself and my dinner partner fighting over the last bite.  The truffle poutine was excellent as well, although the goat cheese was a different pairing that I found brightened up the dish, but was an odd pairing for truffle.  Still great nonetheless.  The cotton candy with the bill was a very special touch, and our servers were total sweethearts.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yay Trevor! Another great restaurant in Toronto. There's gotta to be something to be said about a restaurant that dedicates a section of their menu to foie gras! There was 5 of us, we tried many appetizers and main dishes and we loved them all. The dessert was also great. The décor is very trendy, and there is a bar area. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because we got smoked out at one point - I'm not sure if this is because we're in a basement, but ventilation should be better."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dinner her as my bf had been here a year ago and really loved it.

I was really disappointed. The food was a weird mix of flavours - and not a good weird. Neither of us were happy with our meals, any part of it, not the appetizer, not the main, we didn't bother with dessert. We even returned a side of cauliflower that was oddly burnt on the outsides with no flavour. To their credit, they didn't charge us for it.

What I can say is that the service was wonderful. We asked for a private table and we got one and Jeff made an excellent martini. I feel bad that the service isn't enough for me to go back when the food was so lacklustre."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS! Everything that I ordered turned out to be the love of my taste buds' life. The presentation was pretty, the staff was excellent, and the atmosphere very cozy."}
{"text":"This review is only for Winterlicious 2015 Dinner ($35). The decor and overall feel of this place was very nice and intimate. The service was superb, our waitress was incredibly nice and friendly. $35 for a 3 course meal is worth it and I strongly recommend this place for Winterlicious, or any other event. Also, the bill came with a huge white fluffy ball of cotton candy :D. You can tell it was made fresh in house, not sticky at all.

My friend and I shared a beef cheek and smoked cheddar poutine for $12 (not part of Winterlicious):  a bit pricey but it was worth it in my opinion. I wished there was more cheese though. There was barely any cheese, but the beef cheek just melted in your mouth... it was so good..

*My friend courses: 
-spicy wagyu tartar: The taro chips were crispy and flavorful, it wasn't too soggy nor stale. The tartar itself was a little spicy which I enjoyed. The dressing was amazing because it helped mask some of the raw taste of the beef yet wasn't overpowering, the lime taste at the end provided a refreshing aftertaste.

-northern ontario whitefish: There was no dressing for the vegetables and it wasn't needed. The juices from the tomato as well as the fish itself provided a nice flavor to the vegetables it was sitting upon. The tomatoes were a little sweet which was a huge plus, The fish was cooked really well, it was moist yet they were able to make the skin crispy!

-honey crisp apple raspberry crumble: I enjoyed this dessert because with each bite you get to taste hints of honey. The honey never took away from the dessert itself and you were able to still taste the raspberry.

*My courses: 
-shrimp & chorizo salad: it was really refreshing and light. The shrimps were cooked just right, not too rubbery. The chorizo was a tad spicy, but the queso fresco helped to cut down the spiciness and gave the salad a salty-sour kick.

-8oz aaa sirloin steak: The steak was excellent, perfect medium rare and it was seasoned nicely with salt and pepper. The winter truffle mashed potatoes was not grainy, very creamy and the truffle added just a light touch of earthiness to the mash. The brussel sprouts were okay, it didn't have much flavor. 

-espresso chocolate mousse: The mousse itself is not sweet, the texture was really creamy and light. I can definitely taste the espresso in here, not so much the bourbon though, but the caramel added a nice touch of sweetness, and the sour strawberries helped balance the dish."}
{"text":"Trevor is doing lunch ($25 prix fixe)  now, and that is a great idea.  Went with a pal, we reserved seats at the bar (good idea, it's always busy).   Mac and asiago cheese for her, Steak frites for me.  Both were perfect.  The steak was nice and barely bloody,  the poutine with truffled goat cheese was right on.  Didn't need the steak sauce.  It looked like it was just there to balance the visual of the plate.  

Soup of the day (dressed up tomato soup with parm) was excellent, loved the creme brulee with the perfect thin thin crispy crunch layer. 

Service at the bar seemed smoother than some of what was happening on the floor. 

The food is really basic made fancy, in an unaffected way.   We'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of those instances where i wish i could do half-stars on Yelp.
I would say this is closer to 3.5 than 4...however, this was Winterlicious, so portions need to be taken with a grain of salt.

Found parking on the street right outside the place.
Lovely setting, intimate and nicely lit.
Strong wine and cocktail list.

Winterlicious menu was quite big. 5 choices each for appetizer and entree. I went with the chicken liver pate, and my friend had the asiago mac n cheese (which was quite good!)
Entree was a tiny bit disappointing...we both had the surf and turf. The surf was a small shrimp that was not cleaned very well (the plastic like skin was still on one side), and the turf was not seasoned at all. Like, no salt, no pepper, here's-some-meat not seasoned. Very surprising. The tiny bit of BBQ sauce that accompanied was tasty, but too small of a blurp of sauce. The poutine that came along was the best part.
Dessert was decent. I had a sorbet, and my friend had the chocolate dessert.

The neat surprise though is when the bill comes...it comes with a bowl of cotton candy!! :) Very fun.

So, all in all, was semi disappointing, but the parts i enjoyed, i definitely enjoyed. So willing to lean towards 4 stars than 3, but its reluctantly."}
{"text":"A solid solid 3.5 

The goods: 
- I had the tasting menu. 8 courses, but really i was served around 11. I appreciated that. There was no pretentiousness of little food. I was fed, and fed well.
- Food was all done very well. Everything tasted great. You can see that the chef puts in alot of effort into his food - things being prepared for days, to two weeks. 
- Interior is very warm and welcoming, quite romantic.
- Staff are excellent and well chosen. Not pretentious at all which is a great welcome in Toronto for a place like this

The room for improvement:
- Flooring is not even, makes for a wobbly experience. 
- Food is very good, but the chef could get more creative if he wanted to. Basically, the food was all very good. The chef demonstrates great technique, but little creativity. I would have like to have seen some more of it.  
- I normally don't eat salt and don't even cook with it, but some of the dishes actually felt like salt might have helped take it to the next level. The chef could play around a bit more with basic spices to see what he 
comes up with. I'm sure it would be even greater.   



My over all recommendation is go here. It's worth it, and the food is good. It's one of the few better places in Toronto. There is effort put into the food and you can taste it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my girlfriend, try something different. Decor was good very classy. Service was terrible. Noise level was through the roof due to multiple Christmas party. Can't enjoy the night at all... We ordered the tuna tempura was done  great ! Though the menu said there's jicama and papaya. I got carrots and zucchini . Still good though. We had the beef cheeks with sunchoke risotto , beef cheeks was tender ! But bland.. Risotto didn't taste a hint of sunchoke and was bland too. This dish was garnish with foie .... Heaven.... That save a the dish.  Had a double smoke bacon and pork belly poutine amazing ... Smoke mozz and truffle oil to die for....
Then came dessert.....
Ordered an apple beignet....I love doughnuts and for me it's a must try...
Came to the table ... I'm like what's this? Didn't look like any beignet I've seen it was served with 2 oz of apple pie filling the. Beignet on top of it. And a load of icing sugar . It had apple chantily and lemon granita . Apple chip as a garnish. First off granita? Pointless add on. Chantily great work... Apple chip too thick and burnt taste... Then comes the beignet... Rock hard doughy in the middle . They gave me cutlery and I can barely cut it I'm half. I don't complain when I eat out but I had too... It's just unedible I didn't even touch it.... After that bite. I thought our server was gonna was us for a new dessert instead but nope....all I got was I'll talk to them later it's a new dish... Say what now? I wanted to spit the piece I ate so bad and make him try it. Disgusting...... Not coming back to this place just ruined my dinner ... Service horrible. 
Customers always right... Why would I pay for something in not enjoying and I can hardly eat."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight:

Ambience - 4 / 5 - dimly lit, lounge music.  Nice for a date.  The bathrooms could use a bit of a scrub.

Service - 4 / 5 - the woman who served us was really nice and sweet.  She recommended a few dishes and wine. 

Food - 2 / 5 - we walked out thinking totally not worth the money.  we ordered the beet salad and a side order of the crispy cauliflower.  Both delicious and probably the best part of the meal.  The mains were ok.  The tofu dish was described to me as \"a fluffier version of the fishsticks my mother made us growing up\".  Served with vegetables I could have made at home.  The beef cheek risotto was fine - filling and rich.

Overall - Meh.  2/5.  We saw Trevor on Top Chef Canada and were so looking forward to his ingenuity in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, it really fell flat.  There are so many other places around to go to.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Trevor Kitchen is culinary heaven.
If you are craving really good food, really great wine and unpretentious atmosphere come to Trevor Kitchen. Every dish is formulated with exceptional ingredients uniting in flavorful combinations you won't soon forget. Try their beet salad with goat cheese and seared foie gras with chestnuts for starters. And it's ok to share at Trevor, so enjoy as many dishes as you like.
Wine pairings are fabulous here, guys really know what they are doing and I appreciate it to the last drop.
This is \"As good as it gets!\""}
{"text":"I just want to say. Yelp filtered my review. Everyone, do not neglect the negative side of this restaurant. I created an account to review Trevor Kitchen & Bar solely because it was THAT bad of an experience. 

If its because on record, I only have that one review on yelp - thus making me an untrusted source. Thats pretty bull."}
{"text":"One of the better winterlicious/summerlicious restaurants I have been to. Everything my friends and I ordered were delicious and you know it's a good place to  eat when you have trouble deciding on what to order. Our waiter was nice and we weren't rushed to leave after we paid our bills and wanted to stay and chat. We were seated immediately at our table upon arrival. Absolutely no complaints about the service :)

The restaurant is actually located in the basement so go straight downstairs when you enter. The veering is a little low so if you're taller than about 5\"7 be careful of the ceiling in some parts of the restaurant.

Seared beef and greens was fantastic. Dressing was very tasty and the beef was juicy and went well with the horseradish mayo. Mac and cheese was great. It might not look like much but it's actually rather filling and the bacon crumble have it a crunch which is nice. I like how the macaroni wasn't too soft but al dente.

Out of all the mains, I thought the steak frites was the best for taste and value. Pretty large piece of steak (8oz); my friend asked for medium rare and it came out a bit bloodier than our other friend's steak but still very tender and flavorful regardless. I LOVE the goat cheese poutine! One friend thought the fruits were a little soggy for her liking butt if you don't like soggy fries, you can ask them to go easy on the gravy. I ordered the crispy duck confit and I enjoyed the sweet potato a bit more than the duck. Sweet potato with the red cabbage and blueberry juice combination was unique and yummy. Don't get me wrong, the duck was good, but it was just a little dry. Beef cheek risotto was quite good too. Beef cheek was ok tender but the risotto was good.

We were a little indecisive about dessert and the waiter recommended nutella mousse. None of us tasted any nutella in it; it was just like regular chocolate mousse. I'm a fan of creme brulee and it was good as expected. I actually ordered the dark chocolate torte and it was the best out of the three (none of us ordered the sorbet and berries). The peanut butter chantilly was mindblowingly good!!! The dark chocolate torte was super soft and melted in your mouth. Rich chocolate taste.

This is actually my second time to Trevor and I didn't quite remember the cotton candy with the bill until I read some of the yelp reviews afterwards. We didn't get any cotton candy with our bill, not sure if it's because it's winterlicious...a bit disappointed :(
Doesn't hurt to ask, so remember to ask for your cotton candy once you've got your bill :)"}
{"text":"I'm in the mood for tough love.  Trevor is a fine place.  The food is tasty, and the atmosphere is romantic.  You would probably have a fine meal hear.  BUT, the food is simply too rich.  Like many others, I like rich food.  But consider their poutine: duck gravy, goat cheese, and truffle oil on top.  That's just too heavy handed.  The flavours get all muddled and your heart is screaming for a break.  There are other ways to get great flavours without going so rich."}
{"text":"~Summerlicious Review~

I've said it before, and I'll say it again - Summerlicious is just not my cup of tea. Restaurants seem to have the complete wrong idea with how to handle Summerlicious customers. But this review, and the poor review, has nothing to do with the Summerlicious-ness of it...read on!

We arrived on time and were seated promptly. My friend and I ordered off the Licious menu, and she asked for the shrimp tempura, the pan-seared whitefish and the strawberry tiramisu. I ordered the chipotle chicken taco, the pork rib chop and the dark chocolate torte. I decided to forgo the drink since I just came from a drinks party earlier.

The app was fine - chicken tacos came on a bed of arugula and had minced, almost pasty chicken stuffed into a tiny shell. Next, AND PLEASE READ, the main.....the pork rib chop. I was delighted with the texture at first - very tender and had a good vein of fat on it. My friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while and were engrossed in our conversation, and it wasn't until I'd finished most of the chop when I looked down and realized that the pork was raw. Not just pink, but with the semi-translucency and jigglyness of raw meat. I stopped immediately and flagged our server over when he was close, and I explained that the pork was raw. He proceeded to explain that this is normal near the bone. Normal for pork to be raw? Is it normal for their customers to get sick to their stomachs too?? I politely disagreed - pork is not like beef, and it shouldn't be raw, EVER. He went on to explain the 4 day brining process it goes through. Fine, but...why is it raw?! He asked if I wanted to replace it with anything, but no...I want to NOT eat raw pork! I said no, but I'd like him to tell the chef that the dish was raw.

So it's not hard to see why I'm not happy with their service at all. The server went off and made no further mention of my dish, nor did he come back with any comments from the chef. I was not impressed. I am the opposite of impressed. I can only hope right now that my infamous iron stomach does not fail me now, and will do its best to combat raw pork.

It makes me wonder - if this was not a Summerlicious meal, would they have better addressed my experience?"}
{"text":"Sometimes all it takes is just one moment to fall deeply and madly in love. 

As you step into Trevor, you are ensconced in a warm, intimate atmosphere, ripe for romance. The flickering candles cast a warm glow. The crisp white tablecloths and napkins serve as Trevor's butlered uniform that you will be very well taken care of that night. 

The chickpea crouton in the green salad made for a wonderful startling surprise. I wasn't sure what to expect from a chickpea crouton, but it was a crispy and salty bite of surprise among the cool greens.

And then love came.

One bite of the pasta lovingly coated with a creamy, buttery cognac and chive sauce with lobster and prawns and I was gone. One perfect mouthful of bliss. Seriously, it was incredible. I wanted to cry with each bite because it was so perfect. Silently in the inside, I wept with the knowledge that with each heaven sent bite, I was one bite closer to being done. This is heaven.

Also incredible and wonderful was the side of roasted cauliflower with buerre noisette and almonds. The almonds complemented the roasted cauliflower. Some of the pieces were a little too large. I preferred the smaller pieces, which had a chance to carmelize. The sweetness of the carmelized cauliflower with the nutty flavor of the brown butter and almonds was absolutely delicious. 

I ordered the Honey Fizz (bacardi limon & raz with honey, lemon juice, fresh raspberry & cava) as my cocktail. It was also perfection. If I could have this every week as my Sunday brunch cocktail of choice, I would. It was crisp, fruit, sweet, tart, and utterly refreshing. This drink is my drug of choice. 

If you're looking for a place to impress someone, Trevor is it."}
{"text":"Great ambiance for a basement restaurant. The ricotta gnocchi was flavorful and well-textured, without being overly ambitious for a starter. The surf and turf steak was undercooked (waiter forgot to ask how I would like it, and decided to serve it rare) and the shrimp bland, but definitely improved by the goat cheese poutine on the side. Closed off the menu with the spectacular dark chocolate and caramel torte."}
{"text":"Took my entire Toronto team here - 20+ people, including a bunch of vegetarians and vegans - and we all had a great time and enjoyed good food.

Hard to serve a party that big very well with an unlimited menu, so they did a prix fixe menu for us (appetizer, main dish, dessert) and everyone seemed to wolf down whatever it was they ordered. Or maybe they were just being nice to me b/c I was paying?

Just be careful if you bring any tall people - likely to bump their heads on the low beams. But that's part of the ambiance."}
{"text":"My second Winterlicious destination for 2012 was Trevor Kitchen & Bar, a place that I've been dying to try for a long while. Note that it was extremely hard to make a reservation. My boyfriend called on the first day of Winterlicious reservations for AMEX early birds, the only time available was 9 pm on a Thursday. I was quite surprised that the restaurant was so booked up 3 weeks in advance on a weekday! 

The restaurant is divided into two sides- a dining room and a bar area. Unfortunately, we were seated at one of the high tables near the bar area, and as a result it was very loud. Throughout dinner, our conversation was carried out in shouts in order to be heard.

The dinner didn't start out that great. They forgot to serve us bread so I had to inquire about it. Anyhow, the bread basket actually arrived after our appetizer, but I did enjoy the warm baguette with butter. 

Appetizers

My boyfriend ordered a macaroni and asiago cheese to start. This was yummy and comforting, and I loved the abundance of breadcrumbs. There were breadcrumbs in every mouthful that I took, even when I got to the bottom. For such a heavy starter, I was glad that the portion was small. 

My shrimp & bacon ravioli with coconut lobster sauce didn't fare as well. The coconut lobster sauce was more like a delicate broth, and although it was tasty, it didn't really stand up to the thick ravioli. The Chinese often refers to ravioli as \"Italian wonton\", and in this case, it really reminded me of a wonton, especially with the chives on top. Even though the ravioli was disappointing, I enjoyed soaking up the delicious lobster sauce with the bread.

Mains

For his entrée, my boyfriend chose crispy roast chicken with sour cream and bacon gravy, buttermilk biscuit and collard greens. I honestly thought that this plate of food was divine! Even though I couldn't really see what I was eating (lighting was just abysmally bad), everything was scrumptious. The sour cream gravy was just to die for, and the chicken was marvelously juicy and flavourful. I didn't really get much of the skin, but my boyfriend assured me that it was very crispy, as it should be. 

I opted for the port braised beef cheeks with turnip risotto and horseradish crème fraiche instead. This was also a very delectable plate of food. The risotto was very creamy and rich, and it was cooked to my preferred degree of doneness- with a slight bite and not too mushy. The beef cheeks were incredibly tender and just melted in my mouth. The horseradish flavour really came through and paired well with the rich meat. But my favourite component was the turnip chips scattered on top of the risotto. They provided a delightful, crunchy contrast to the risotto. My only complaint about this dish was that everything was amazingly rich: the meat, the cream, and the risotto. 

Dessert

We both ordered the cookies & cream tiramisu because there was no way that either of us could pass up on this! No regrets at all because this was fabulous! It was exactly like a tiramisu, minus the coffee and add the cookies and cream! The ratio of cream to cake was good, but I would've liked more cookie crumbs for more textural contrast. Nevertheless, we both loved this dessert and it was a great end to the meal!

At the end, we were also served some complimentary cotton candy. Even though I'm not a big fan of cotton candy myself, I loved that it's so whimsical and fun! We were both pretty full, so we only took nibbles of it. 

All in all, this was undoubtedly one of my best Winterlicious experiences so far. Even though service wasn't perfect, I was blown away by the food (except for the ravioli), and I would seriously consider coming back for the next 'licious event!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious - Delicious food, wonderful servers but long wait time in between courses.

The food was really good, the appetizer portion size was a little small but the entrees more than made up for it. The wait time before getting our first plates was a little long, would have been nice to serve some complimentary bread. The waiter was very nice, he forgot the cocktail we ordered even after two reminders but he gave it to us free of charge.

Overall, would consider coming back to try the normal menu."}
{"text":"I will have to admit that after reading some of the reviews here I was second guessing my decision to bring my parents here for dinner. I knew it was Winterlicious and that can sometimes impact the restaurant's service and atmosphere but I really wanted to give it a try. The other reason I really wanted to go here was for their fois gras selections. My dad is a big fois gras fan and I figured this would be a great place for him. 

Despite what others have said I enjoyed the downstairs venue. I could see how in the summer it might not be as appealing but on a cold winter night it was very welcoming. 

The hostess quickly took our coats and showed us to our table. My parents were already there and enjoying a drink. When I sat down my dad broke the bad news to me - we could only order from the Winterlicious menu. What!!!! No fois gras! Are you kidding me?! 

I quickly ordered a cocktail to help me get over my shock and disappointment. I have to say the specialty cocktail of the evening which consisted of apple cider, brown sugar and rum was rather delicious and put me in a better mood. I then had a very quiet heart to heart with our server Garth (great guy) and explained that my parents had driven all the way from Peterborough for some fois gras and could he please ask the chef to dig some up. Well I guess my pleading worked because the chef agreed to add some fois gras to my dad's entree. Yeah! 

Once all of that was settled we got down to the business of ordering. For appetizers we ordered the shaved winter vegetable salad, macaroni and asiago cheese and the diver scallops with pork belly. My mom loved her salad and was surprised by how good the arugula was as she's not normally a fan. My boyfriend was in love with his mac and cheese. So much so I didn't think I was going to get a bite. And well my dad and I were in heaven with our diver scallops that were cooked to perfection and well who doesn't love pork belly with crispy skin? Hmmm pork fat. Love it! 

Our mains were just as good. My mom the vegetarian ordered the pasta with sage and parsnip cream, I had the port braised beef cheeks with risotto, dad had the surf and turf with a side of fois gras (which was huge!) and my BF had the trout. Of all the dishes I would have to say that the trout was my least favourite. Tad too greasy tasting. But everything else was great. My beef cheeks were so tender and good. My mom's pasta was really really good. Very rich. And well my dad didn't say much. I think he was having a fois gras moment. 

Dessert was also good. 2 creme brules, a chocolate torte and a cookies and cream tiramasu later we were pretty stuffed. However my mom found room to eat all of the cotton candy that arrived at our table at the end of the meal. 

A big thank you to Garth our server. Let's face it good food can often be overshadowed by bad service. Garth did a great job!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for the Summerlicious. I've been wanting to try this place out for a while so I thought Summerlicious would be the best opportunity. The earliest reservation I could get was for 9:30pm but it was definitely worth it.

Upon entering you go down a flight of stairs to the basement where the restaurant is located. The space is divided into two areas: a bar side and small dining room. The restaurant was very dimly lit but packed full of diners with a very upbeat atmosphere. We waited in the small lounge area on the bar side as our table was being prepared.
The hostess came over shortly and took us to a small cozy candle lit table along a banquet.

For drinks we decided to order some cocktails

Tranquility - gin with elderflower nectar & champagne
Boy oh boy was this ever strong! I enjoyed it as it wasn't overly sweet however I'm a light weight drinker and I couldn't finish it as I don't think I would have been able to make it back up that flight of stairs. None the less I wanted a strong drink and it served it's purpose

Here's what I ordered from the summerlicious line up:

Seared sea scallop with pork belly & smoked pepper rouille
Scallop was cooked perfectly with a crunchy sear and the pork belly was succulent and tender. I loved the smoked pepper sauce and appreciated the accompanying greens for some contrast to my meat

Northern ontario whitefish with rosti, nappa cabbage & lobster tartare sauce
The fish was beautifully cooked with a very crispy skin nestled upon a golden rosti. The lobster tartare sauce was amazing with whole chunks of lobster mixed in. I enjoyed every part of this.

Dark chocolate & caramel torte with peanut butter chantilly
I am a die hard fan of anything peanut butter and chocolate so hands down this was already a winner. The dark chocolate cake was very moist and not overly sweet which I really enjoyed and paired with that peanut butter chantilly it was out of this world good!

Overall a wonderful Summerlicious experience. Although service wasn't the best at times as our waiter brought the bread after the appetizers were done and did not offer tea or coffee with dessert (couldn't find him until I had finished my dessert) the meal however was exceptional from start to finish!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a foodie.    Ambiance is nice to have, but the make or break for me is food.

Went here with some buddies and found the food to be decent but not amazing.   I ordered the Venison and a starter salad.   The meat was pretty tough compared to venison I had tried before.   I ordered it medium rare and it came out that way.    Salad was good (mixed greens w/candied pecans), however it could have been taken up a notch with some grated parm on top. 

My friends ordered the lamb chops, buttermilk chicken and fois gras poutine.   I didn't try the first two, but they raved about it.    The fois gras poutine was delicious and I am not the biggest fois gras fan.

Service was great and free corkage a real plus!
