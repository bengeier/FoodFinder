{"text":"Great bartenders, great food, and lots of sports on a ton of TVs. Newly remodeled. Many beers on tap."}
{"text":"A great local hangout with the best wings I've had in a long time! So far I love all the bartenders too! They won't let you run dry"}
{"text":"Formerly Roscoe's Sports Bar, Phx Sports Grill (name soon to change I believe) has gotten a beautiful makeover with a new owner who is sure to stop by your table to ask how everything is! Great happy hour specials, haven't had anything from the menu yet that I didn't love and the staff is just so friendly and attentive. If you were a Roscoe's patron for many years like I was, definitely stop in and see that changes that have been made. You will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Hats off to the new owner Ryan and team!  We had a great time last night, plenty of room for the crew with great food,service and fun! Highly recommended and love the cold beers!!!"}
{"text":"McKenzie's is awesome!!!

Great food, drink, & service.

Hawaiian shirts, frozen drinks, & an awesome east-facing patio really make these summer days enjoyable.

Beer variety is solid and food will not disappoint.

I highly recommend this local, neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Bottle spinning Bartender.  Second visit in two days. They have the real deal Midwest style cheese curds!  And great wings."}
{"text":"Amazing. The reviews don't lie. The drinks are poured with love. The wings are outstanding and the service is Great!  This will be a regular place while I'm visiting Phoenix. And I come here at least 5 times a year for work. Prices are good as well. Happy hour is from 3-7. On Saturdays they have actual goldfish racing. And I plan to see what it's all about. Lots of t.v.s so if your wanting to watch a game chances are it's playing at the PHX."}
{"text":"Great location and great atmosphere.  New owner, Ryan, is going to make this place the new place you'll want to go.   You won't regret coming and the wings are great"}
{"text":"So last time I was here it was PHX and known in the neighborhood as a gay friendly bar. I had heard it had new ownership and that the new owners were planning to embrace and enhance the bar and keep the bartenders and the friendly vibe. I was thrilled when I was told it was bicycle friendly and that if you ride your bike to the bar you get happy hour all day! Sounds good to me.

There was about 7-8 of us on bikes and decided to stop by and see what they have done with one of our favorite local spots.

Where things began to decline...

First off, your logo is a BICYCLE and you are targeting bicyclists. How do you only have a small rack that holds about 4 bikes in the back of the building unsupervised? Some of my friends decided to move along but my boyfriend and I decided to lock our bikes together and risk it.

We walked in and immediately it felt like Daytona Beach spring break. Bottle tossing, Hawaiian shirts, sailor hats and slushie machines. Slushie machines? Excuse me is this a 9 year olds birthday party? I mean don't get me wrong I'm guilty of having a little fat Tuesdays around my neck while in vegas. But not at a bar in Phoenix. Maybe it was intended for the kids? Ok, thats fine, new owners, new vibe. I will say the interior was more inviting and the extra bathroom really helped ease the awkwardness and lines.

The drinks were ok, not very strong, I couldn't taste the Tequila in my drink and my boyfriends vodka tonic was basically tonic water. There was weird odor coming from behind the bar so we declined to decline the offer to order food since weren't sure if thats was being served. The vibe was weird. We felt like we walked into boys night out and disrupted the bottle tossing class. Im not sure if the owners visit their establishment ever, but the interior doesn't match the overly cheesy resort tropical theme of the bartenders. The bartenders seemed more interested in praising each other and whispering in a huddle to pay mind to the customers. Granted there weren't very many of us. But it made us feel uncomfortable. We had one drink and left. I will say I'm a little behind on writing my reviews since i was traveling and maybe they have installed bike racks by now. Based on my experience I wouldn't call Mackenzies a \"bike friendly tavern.\" I didn't see a familiar face and it looked like a cruise ship bar staff was air dropped into the bar. With all new places opening in the area I don't this place stands chance."}
{"text":"Traveling out of town and decided to stop in a local bar for some food and a beer. As advertised the wings were big and outstanding!!!  Ryan the owner engaged me from behind the bar and poured me a beer topped with with margarita.  It was heaven!!!  Might be giving away my age but the place reminds of Cheers and the owner reminds me of Sam Malone.  5 Stars!!!  Next time I'm in town I will be heading to McKenzie's Midtown Tavern!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite bartenders from around central Phoenix all in one place! Good beer selections and there's good food!"}
{"text":"Was here recently to watch an NBA playoffs game, and was so glad to discover it. We had actually tried a couple of other spots before finding McKenzie's--the other sports bars just didn't have all the right elements. But at McKenzie's, there are plenty of spots to watch the game, friendly service, and tasty eats. Seemed like they maybe had a regular clientele which added to the friendly vibe. Overall, a solid place!"}
{"text":"A quick stop in for a bite and it was wonderful to see the new modern changes of this old haunt. 

Excellent TV's and a NEW server that was backed up by a seasoned pro, making sure we had everything we wanted. As expected the ownership team was present and welcoming, that was my favorite part.

We shared some wings and a pizza and both were great. The Pizza crust is 2 large flour tortillas melded together with some melted cheese then over topped with great sauce, above average mozzarella and lots' of meat, it was almost executed perfect but still real good. the wings are large with a great classic Buffalo sauce. both ranch and bleu cheese served as requested. Awesome crisp celery and carrots served along side and that was FRESH! These wings are about a million times better then BWW and a far better deal.

I really like this great little sports bar with a great personal touch, Great food and really good service."}
{"text":"Nice place, good beer selection from microbrews to PBR. Daily food specials with Comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. A Winning Combination! I will be back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar? Free pool on Tuesdays? Drink specials nightly? This place has that and food. 

Stopped in for some pool and enjoyed ourselves greatly. 

Close enough to ride my bike (happy hour prices all day if you do) I'll be back by."}
{"text":"Great owners! Really care about the customers! Ill defiantly be here again! Brian and Sam are the best!"}
{"text":"I'm a day drinker, so I can't speak to the night time vibe.  Came with a buddy and the barkeep was helpful, friendly and timely.  I like the layout of the place, the only drawback is that during the day, it's way too bright.  When I go to a dive (neighborhood) bar, I like the coziness of a dark bar where you may not be able to recognize the boozer next to you when you come back next week.
I'll be back, but I'll wait until the sun goes down."}
{"text":"Awesome, great food great  drinks  Ryan the owner is a great guy. Sam the bartender is awesome,
Great wings great burgers. Cold beers. What more can you ask for. And not expensive. Shout out to Adam & Jimmy well known valley bartenders, come see them . Voted best central city bar. Ride your bike & get happy hour all day."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for the first time. Drinks were good and reasonably priced. They also have great ongoing drink deals. Many TVs, pleasant service. The food was fairly good. I had the wings, and they were pretty good... nothing spectacular though, but the atmosphere was most definitely a positive experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a tough customer in general.This place is doing it all right from what I can see. Good atmosphere.Good lighting .Dart boards that are newish and actually work!.Friendly owner and staff. Did I mention a nice decor .I would call it a \"smart sports bar\".The ones takes the time to talk to people and makes good drinks.I think this place  will be a hit in the neighborhood .People seem to be having fun and it was an even mix of male to female customers.I will be back with more friends for darts, food and drink."}
{"text":"Well I just can't say enough nice things about this little neighborhood joint!   Friendly patrons, smiling staff and the best bar food ever!   Best wishes and much success to them in the years to come.   They deserve it!   Cheers Ryan & Sam and all the staff..."}
{"text":"You haven't had wings till you have had wings here!! Sweet baby of all wings. The drinks are great and reasonably priced. Now let's get down to the real reason for my review is ROBB the bartender. Excuse me, where did you come from? I'm pretty certain he came from heaven. He is so friendly and attentive I can't wait to come back again. Being so close to my house and work it's my new go to."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. TV's everywhere if you want to watch sports. Good food and drink at great prices. Attentive staff. Clean. I highly recommend you stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it definitely won't be my last.  This bar is very welcoming. The Owner came to our table to welcome us and suggested several items off the menu. The \"Totcho's\" are amazing, the fried pickles were by far the best pickles I've ever had. If you haven't tried his place out I suggest that you do. Great bar it's like the \"Cheers\" of Phoenix!"}
