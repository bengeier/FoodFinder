{"text":"Ok let me start by saying don't listen to the bad reviews. I'm in the restaurant business and I get what they are saying. Look it's a new hotel/restaurant so they are working out the kinks. It was a slow night when I was in, it was a Monday. My service was fantastic and the food on point!! I'll be eating here again next spring training. GO CUBS!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had an amazing filet with giant asparagus and sweet corn risotto. The meals come with a tasty wedge salad, complete with green olives! Great food, delivered by friendly knowledgable staff make this place a new favorite."}
{"text":"We stayed @ the Sheraton for graduation. There was no ome in the restaurant, yet it took them  forever to take our orders & bring our food. I ordered atypical ceaser salad  w citrus dressing on the side.  The dressing was not on the side, nor was it citrus.  Pretty gross dressing. It was 105 degrees outside,  yet the room was  hot & stuffy- no air conditioning!. Even when they supposedly turned the a/c on, it was still hot. Overall, bad service & bad food= 0 rating!!"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Sheraton hotel which makes it convenient for guests. However, our experience barely deserves the one star. The service was plain bad and the food was so-so at best, save your money! We came here and were one of two tables for dinner. The place was completely empty. The waitress must have had something on her mind because it took 3 tries to get a straw, two requests for a beer and what she brought us was wrong, and she totally forgot about my wine refill. My coworker asked for a Cabernet and they were \"all out\". They had 7 cabs listed on the menu, but somehow they were out and she had to make another choice. 

The food was not impressive. My coworker ordered a steak that was overcooked and lacked flavor. I ordered the lobster tail and the piece of lobster was TINY! It looked more like a shrimp than a lobster tail. The veggie sides were ok, but that's about it. 

Save your money and go away from the hotel to a real steak house. The drive will be worth it."}
{"text":"Service was so slow. 
Ordered au gratin potatoes. All it was small bowl of french fried potatoes with small amount of cheese sauce on it like nachos. 
Steak was prepared well but portions are small especially for the price."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the experience i just had here! The food was excellent, and  the service was on point. My server JJ was super cute and very attentive, huge plus, but was also knowledgeable on the whole menu and wine list.. The best part about this steakhouse is the  reasonably priced wine bottle selection. They also do half off bottles on Thursdays!   I was thoroughly impressed with my NY strip and grilled asparagus, both were perfectly cooked and the potato au gratin was unbelievable! The salad was fresh aIm really glad i found a reasonable place to eat with an upscale feel in my neighbor hood,  I highly suggest trying out this steakhouse if staying at the hotel, or just live in the area."}
{"text":"Splendid location at Wrigleyville West. Fine dining with generous servings and choice of menu with emphasis on agricultural sustainability products.
We enjoyed just the right meal with balanced favors and great service. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is amazing! Our service was top notch too! I had the New York Strip which was wonderful. Wife had Black Bass good as well plus the sides were great? I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We got a good sampling of their food. 3 appetizers; 2 entrees; 2 wines; 5 sides.  Shrimp cocktail presentation was lovely and the horseradish sauce had good depth of flavor.  It was much hotter than I like but my hubby loved the heat.  
Tuna appetizer was perfectly prepared but needed a sprinkle of sea salt to elevate it.  The lime sauce was delicious!
Creamy artichoke dip was much more complex than your Applebee's thick gooey over cheesed one note dip.  The tomatoes lend a nice freshness to the dip. 
Lamb T-bones were perfect medium rare and the Demi-glace was flavorful. 
Pork shank braising liquid was a tad runny and could use some time reducing. 
Potatoes gratin were clunky.  Needed to be peeled or served in another vessel.  It is impossible to cut the huge thick potatoes or fit them in even the biggest of all mouths (an insurance salesman! Lol) 
Cepollini onions were perfectly roasted and enough to share. Don't pass them up!
Mushrooms were good not great.  
We were too full to try their dessert menu.  Next time. We will be back. There are a couple other entrees we want to try!
Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with a group of 8. They have a good menu with steak, seafood, lamb, pork++. I had the pork chop which was tasty but not very tender. All else good! Excellent waitress.
Stats, bar next to it was really fun and watched Monday night football."}
{"text":"The steak was perfect. Had the New York Strip.  Highlight by far was the shrimp corn chowder. Amazing. Have to try it. Ask for James if he's there."}
{"text":"Wow this was a huge disappointment. Had 7pm reservations. 815 and no entree. Took almost an hour to get salad. There are 4 other tables occupied in resturant. No host, 1 waiter who is busting his ass but he can only do so much. It is still spring training and the hotel is completely full. I have seen at least 5 groups leave because no one sat them. We are have 2 little girls with us and they are falling asleep at the table. We finally got food and the protein was good but steak was under cooked. My wife's potato and mushrooms were cold while my creamy spinach was just wilted baby spinach. I would have felt better if waiter addressed issue but instead he acted like everything was ok. If he would have said sorry for wait i would have felt better about issue.  The bathrooms are no better with the trash over flowing with paper towels. Honestly I will never go back to this place. Hotel or resturant."}
{"text":"Last night my family and I had made reservations through Open Table for my birthday at Legends Steak, a restaurant within the Sheraton Mesa Hotel.  Upon arriving we learned that the restaurant was closed about two weeks ago due to a revision in management.  When the Management Team learned of our situation they went into action and provided a private dining room and offered us the choice of ordering from the Stats restaurant menu (bar setting) or the Legends menu.  Nicole our waitress and bar manager provided stellar service to ensure that my evening was wonderful as we celebrated my landmark birthday!  The food was very good and serving sizes huge.    The Director for the facility has offered us an invitation back to the grand reopening."}
{"text":"***the bad

Place is understaffed, there was no host, so we had to wonder around the restaurant to find a waiter that would seat us. For our table of two, getting our drink order took at least 10 mins, when there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant. When the food came, I had ordered creamed spinach and but they brought out steamed. So they took steamed spinach in the back and poured milk on it. My fillet I ordered medium well, came out medium rare and the amount of bearnise sauce that came on the steak was embarrassing. And overall service was extremely slow. 

***the good

Steak had a decent flavor, chipolini onions were good also. The waiter discounted the bill because they were embarrassed how bad everything was."}
