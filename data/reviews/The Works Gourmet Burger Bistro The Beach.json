{"text":"The place recently opened so we decided to give it a try. It was a chain and I heard about it and saw they had a promotion for $5 burgers. I had the special (The Grid) and my wife got the \"Love your Guts\" Veggie burger. We were both grossed out. My burger was just plain beef with a pile of bacon. My napkin was drenched in oil. I had to eat fries to absorb the oil. My wife on the other hand hated the taste of her burger and ate half of a $14 burger. My burger was only $5 and I felt ripped off. Sorry but I should have gone to burger priest, hero or five guys. Save your money, if you want the McGurgles go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"We initially had low hopes for this place because it is part of a chain but we were pleasantly surprised! The menu is massive (tons of different suggested topping combos) and can feel overwhelming but it's fun to discuss the options with your table mates. The burgers were juicy and thick and buns were soft and flavorful. Lots of healthy choices for sides and the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu. Mushrooms and onions are very tasty toppings and they don't scrimp on the toppings."}
{"text":"All the times I have gone, the quality of the burgers were always good. They were big and juicy and have so many assortments of burgers that you come back to try them all. But for 15 dollars plus for just the burger and side is way too expensive. I would rather go to hero burger where I can get a drink, and a side for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time yesterday and were very pleased. The waitress gave excellent service and had a great attitude. The food was sooooo good and for a decent price for you get. We will definitely hit it up next time we are in the neighbourhood. Oh ps it was only .95 extra for glutton free."}
{"text":"We went in to try it, friends had said good things about it, so we had high hopes.  Service was great, really nice girl, but the place was empty at dinner time on a weekend.  The food was ok, the bun and burger were quite good, but the toppings were very meager, for the prices they are charging, the toppings should be very impressive (considering right across the street, burgers and fries are $5.95, and the place was packed)  Plus, when the food came, I tried putting salt and pepper, (they have very cute shakers that look like light bulbs) but the salt and the pepper shaker didn't work, I am guessing condensation got into the shakers, it happens, but it tells me the staff doesn't check them enough.  We shouldn't have been seated here unless everything at the table was checked.   I checked my phone and found a wifi signal, at the tables have advertisements for apps that they have, but when I asked for the wifi password, I was informed the signal is only for office use.  Our bill for 2 burgers, 2 drinks, and an app, was over $50.00 We could have had a real meal for that much, not just burgers. A few little points, but points nonetheless, we wont be back, and if this place remains this emprty, they wont last for long."}
