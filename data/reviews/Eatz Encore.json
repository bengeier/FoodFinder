{"text":"When you're having a crazy day and there's no time to cook but the idea of takeout pizza one more time makes you want to scream, this place comes to the rescue.  Lots of pre-cooked meal options and nice soups and salads to choose from.  The gazpacho (only available in summer) is amazing.  They also have a selection of sandwiches and baked goods which are pretty good.  Most of the time everything is top quality and well prepared, once or twice I had fish from here that was not super fresh.  It didn't make me sick or anything, it just tasted slightly off.  It can get pricey fast, as most things are priced by weight, but it's generally good value.  Service is usually friendly and efficient.  Once or twice the guy who served me even threw in an extra baked good treat for free.  All in all, a great healthy alternative to takeout now and then!  And gazpacho of the gods."}
{"text":"This is an updated review.  I have lowered my rating as I feel the food here is markedly overpriced for what it is having used many home cooked options (where they deliver Directly comparably options).  Eg today I had general Tao chicken in a medium container and it set me back $15 to my surprise. That portion size at cinq saisons counter would be same quality level and cost less there and include two sides.   The food is good but doesn't blow me away. The service is friendly and the decor is nice with a good location.  I just don't feel the price value point meets my needs.  If you ignore price tags and like the food keep supporting them."}
{"text":"Fresh great sandwiches and salad. Very cheap for what you are getting!  They also do catering service"}
{"text":"Eatz is a great place if you don't cook and don't really want to start (which I don't) and you don't want to go to a restaurant. The food is prepared in house and is always fresh. Great soups, salads and cakes and more. The service is amazing.....very patient staff who seem to always be helping people who for some reason have never seen food before. It's got a great location in the Victoria Village right on Sherbrooke. It's a family owned business and it's not uncommon for the owner and her sons to serve you behind the counter. My personal favorite, mix the tuna salad with the corn salad (corn, tomato, onion, oil and cilantro)......great flavor profile."}
{"text":"It's a cute little deli store that makes fresh salads, sandwiches, and soups.... and the best gazpacho I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife went into eatz this afternoon. She went to the counter to pay. By mistake she thought she was before another women. When she said she was first the owner at the top of his voice told her she wasn't and she was a liar, this even before she could apologize to this woman.I guess business is so good you can insult your customers ."}
{"text":"Essentially it is a prepared foods store. There's tons of different salads, sandwiches, soups, family-sized mains like lasagna, Shepherd's Pie and Mac and Cheese are on the offering but what really kicks everything up a notch here are the prepared mains and sides. Roasted sweet potato, roasted red peppers, brussels spouts, French green beans with shallots, fingerling baby potatoes, baked potatoes, rapini, tandoori chicken wings, shrimp tempura, sole Meuniere, garlic shrimp, crab cakes, meat loaf, grilled mustard chicken and tons more. All of it is fresh and the few items I've picked up so far, has been nothing less than tasty. If you're not in the mood to cook but don't want take-out again, this place is perfect. Desserts are great too, I've tried the key lime pie and the apple strudel  so far but they have other pies and brownies on the offering as well.  The only downside is the price. Everything here is sold by weight and items like shrimp and crab add up quickly. Still, for those times you are in a fix, it's worth it."}
{"text":"6 $ taxes oncluses pour un bon petit sandwich et une salade de quinoa, je trouve ça honnête. Le sandwich était très bon. Il aurait pu me proposer une serviette en papier et une cuillère en plastique pour mon take-out car on s'en met facilement partout. Comment je fais pour manger ma salade de quinoa ?"}
{"text":"Good food, a friendly young lady helping me with my order made for a  nice experience.  When I'm Westmount I'll definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Salades, sandwiches and more to go or to eat in one of the 3 tables availables.. Cafeteria food."}
