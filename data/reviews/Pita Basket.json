{"text":"Had the bite sized shawarma and a fattoush salad. Portions were huge compared to my usual places in Calgary. Good quality chicken, tons of flavour, fresh toppings. Nice employee as well. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best donair by far that I have eaten. Consistent and absolutely delicious every time we have eaten here. The staff are friendly and professional. Great anytime."}
{"text":"As long time loyal Cedars deli eaters we thought we would check this out as it is fairly new. We had a 2 for 1 coupon from the student union coupon book for there so it enticed us in. 

My husband had chicken shawarma and I had beef shawarma. Preferred the beef - the meat was cooked to order on the grill which I thought was amazing since for most shawarma places, any meats there have been sitting on the warmer for any length of time, depending on how many other customers are ordering the same dish! Perfect blend of spices - cinnamon-y but well balanced. I preferred the taste to anything I have had from Cedars, more flavour. Not scarce on the sauce or toppings.  

A tad pricey without the coupon but comparable to other shawarma spots in price. Will definitely go back! New and clean and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Have gone here a few times now as our usual falafel place is closed for renovations. Always have enjoyed the falafel and service, but today I was very disappointed with the service. I went in around 6:45pm and ordered our usual and I had to stand there for about 10 mins before I had anyone come over. There was a girl on her phone texting and after she finished texting she finally came over and gave me a baklava on the house. When she first made our order she screwed up. At least the good thing about it was she did remake them and our falafels were fresh. Just my only complaint is that no one should have to wait 10 mins to be served, especially when there's no one waiting to order food."}
{"text":"This place is our go to instead of pizza or Chinese. They are friendly, helpful, and took my order right before closing to deliver. Chef Ro is always accommodating. He was so great, let us know he was open extended hours through Christmas and we could order right up to 5 minutes before close.  He is cool with ordering off menu and always gets it right! Never had something I didn't like here. Try everything! We've eaten in a lot and the service is speedy and portions are always plentiful."}
{"text":"I have eaten Shawarma sandwiches (both chicken and beef) here and It was really good but their falafel was bitter and I probably won't try it again. 

Very crowded at noon. 
It's not good place to take your wife/date to.

Staff were nice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Service was fabulous, the olde tavern clubhouse was fantastic! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place, excellent tasty food anytime. The owner is always around, a very friendly place. The food is probably the best Lebanese food I've ever had, I love the way the food is served, different (in a better way) in it's presentation of you dine in. The price is very reasonable, I'd rather eat here anyway, anytime over anywhere else in Airdrie
Oh yeah, the home made soup is amazing, I recommend it, tasty, healthy and made in house"}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent value, fresh ingredients, generous portions, and delicious meals. You're always treated like gold, which certainly doesn't hurt either. This is our go-to for Mediterranean in Airdrie. Love it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always tasty and the workers are always so friendly. The portion of food they give you is pretty good, I think it's worth trying. I always get the Mediterranean chicken plate and they always give me a good portion of chicken, rice and lots of veggies with humus and pita bread. I would definitely recommend this place if you love eating!"}
{"text":"The falafel reminds me a bit of the Cedar's Deli falafel, double wrapped in a couple thin pitas, filled with fresh vegetables, picked vegetables and tahini and lightly toasted in a panini grill. It was a very nice first impression, probably the best falafel in Crowfoot. 

The two guys working this evening were friendly, there was one table that seemed to fit a family of 10, a big screen TV on in the back of the room, and the whole place was nice and bright and new.

Aside from the falafel, their menu has beef and chicken shawarma, shish kabob and shish tawook, family packs for $28 and 40-serving Mansif trays for $150! They have baklava, and baba ghanouj and grape leaves."}
{"text":"Good authentic middle eastern food with generous portions.  If I lived and worked in downtown Calgary, this place would be a regular stop for my wife and I.  We liked the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"This is probably the best little place around the area. The staff is amazingly friendly!  The food is to die for!  The baklava is so fresh and sweet I have to always order more than I should!  The wraps are filled to the brim with meat and veggies. And the sauce is so sweet it's worth drinking from the bottom of the bag..."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for lunch and dinner. I have had salad, donair, and their platters. I have yet to try anything I haven't loved. Very tasty, hot and fresh. Very good spice and heat, not too much not too little! Service is always fantastic, the people are very friendly and eager to make your experience positive. A Local Gem!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have stopped in three times to eat at Pita Basket. The food is fabulous tasty and of generous proportions. I love my donairs and this place makes the best in town (and in whole Calgary area). If it's busy in line count on a complimentary baklava too. 
Great place!"}
{"text":"My first time at Pita basket was a great experience! The owner/manager was super helpful with the menu and explained each item with great enthusiasm and detail. With so many options it's hard to choose just one dish! Excellent service and delicious food, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The bite size sharwarma has chicken meat, and it tastes really good hot fresh from the pan.beef donair has ham. All of portions are huge. And the guy working here is really welcoming."}
{"text":"Are you serious wilted lettuce & soggy tomatoes was so disappointed how dare you serve this to the public!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice, but the second time will be my last.  We decided to do a quick stop for donairs because we were tired and hungry, wanted something moderately healthy, it was late, and they were still open.  The place is normally clean, a lot of items on the menu don't make sense (there are a lot of names for items with no descriptions) but we knew what we wanted so we figured things would be easy.  I ran in while D waited in the car and ordered two regular donairs with sweet sauce.  Now the first time we went the food was passable, okay at best.  This time we were hoping for something better but with what happened I honestly should have walked away because the end result wasn't worth it.  Here's what happened:

I went in and ordered the donairs, everything seemed fine.  The young woman at the counter started prepping them and went to add the meat, and the first one went okay.  Now, when it comes to the toppings they're all kept in little bins at the top of the bar-style fridges.  If the little bins are removed the fridge itself is open to the air and this raises the temperature of the fridge, causing it to either work harder or the air inside to warm to the point where the food stored within may spoil.  When she was putting meat on the second donair a piece fell into the fridge because some of the little ingredient bins were removed and there was a huge opening.  Instead of grabbing more meat from the warmer she reached into the fridge and to my everlasting shock she put the meat back on the donair.  I stopped her as quick as I could because it doesn't matter how clean she thinks the inside of the fridge is, you do NOT do that.  Ever.  The potential for contamination is huge and that is so absolutely disgusting that I had her fix the wrap.  She couldn't remember what piece it was, so she removed a bunch of the meat and redid it, but honestly that should have never happened in the first place.  It is the equivalent of having food fall on the floor and putting it back on a plate.

If that is their idea of food safety I'm sorry but I will never eat at this location again.  The thought of going in turns my stomach every time we drive by."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couples times and I must admit. I LOVE this place, I can't get enough. 

The person whom I assume is the owner is simply amazing! It's obvious to see he takes pride in this restaurant and the food. The daily specials are always a treat to try. I have yet to try the rest of the menu but I certainly can't wait. 

The food is always fresh, super tasty and they are not scared to put sauce. Unlike some places, that skimps out on the sauce and I have to ask for more. 

The restaurant is clean and had great ambiance and I do enjoy that they give you a little treat while you wait. Just an all around great place to try, definitely recommend everyone to try it out."}
{"text":"I am super tired after long day but I think it won't be fair if I don't give my review about my experience Pit Basket in Airdrie. 

I was looking for halal good restaurant in Airdrie and they are only couple of them here. 

After seeing positive reviews On Yelp I decide to try.

Pros
- Great Ambiance 
- Friendly Staff
- Decent menu
- Good food portion
- Food 

 
Cons

I didn't find any.

Best shawarma place in Airdrie, AB"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time since it opened. Went in and was quickly greeted. The fellow prepared my donair,  asked what items I would like on it. The pita bread he was using looked like it driven over as it was stretched out and had holes in it. When I ate the donair it was dry and difficult to chew.
The quality of the food was okay but Moe's donair is 1000 times better.

Also the guy couldn't print off my receipt and called an older fellow out of the back who went at the debit machine while wearing a greasy disposable rubber glove that was filled with blood from a poorly dressed cut on one of his fingers. Not exactly beneficial to one's appetite seeing this (gross)!"}
{"text":"I definitely think of it as a pita shop instead of a cafe, but If you're hungry and in need of a quick, tasty shawarma, Pita Basket Cafe is a good place to eat.

 They've got a  whole team ready to have you wrap ready assemble-line-style before you can even redeem your Check-In offer*. There are tables and chairs as well as some window bar sitting make it a good place to stop with a few co-workers over the lunch break or even just pop in by yourself. 

It's really not the kind of place I'd think of as a Cafe, though. Understanding that all Cafe really means is \"coffee\", I definitely associate the word with a certain type of business. I wouldn't think to go to Pita Basket Cafe for a meeting, to catch up with a friend or get some work done, or even really drink coffee for that matter. They have specialty coffees, but I'm currently a little skeptical because the coffee I ordered is just out of a self serve pump jug tucked away in the back corner, and was mostly water. Oh well... It's a pita shop, after all, and if you go for a shawarma or donair, you'll get a tasty wrap of very generous size at a good price!

*They've currently got a Yelp Check-In offer for a free piece of Baklava and a coffee with any purchase - a nice surprise and more than a good enough excuse to eat some Baklava."}
{"text":"I ordered a platter of sandwiches ($63) for a work event. You get 7 large shawarmas cut in half, a mix of chicken, beef and chickpea. I would order more chicken and chickpea over the beef, which was salty. Pita Basket delivered the food ($5) and the shawarmas were delicious. I like the thin grilled pita and the freshness of all the veggies. Everyone enjoyed the food and I thought the value was great. I would't hesitate to use them again. I spoke to the owner and have his number for future catering orders. He delivers all over the city."}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot. This just opened a few weeks ago, and today was the day I craved a Donair. I typically drive across town for the best donair ever, but I figured I would try something new. 

Guy working was super pleasant, the restaurant was very clean. He gave me a piece of baklava to munch on while I was waiting, and it was delicious.

I would give this restaurant a second place ribbon within the city of Airdrie. Its gonna be hard for anyone to be Extreme Donair."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm sad I'm hardly ever home anymore because Pita Basket is where it's at. The first time I ordered they must have been close to closing because we ordered on skip and got a bunch of complimentary stuff. Their hummus is SO GOOD and the owner is so friendly and knows a lot about customer service. I HIGHLY recommend them if you like donair or schawarma. Their sweet sauce is on point too. Not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!!!  So- to start with it is super clean!   The owner is wonderful and what we love is that he always remembers our Favorite things  that we usually order...how nice is that???   It makes us feel so good... that people who really care to remember is and what we like.
Whatever we eat is always fresh and delicious and my husband has now been there over 7 times, literally. To take out for us or he ate there.  Not one time was it off, nor hard to chew, nor over cooked  etc... Every single time has been the delicious food.
Chicken with hummus  with a salad called (Fattoush). .. Delicious!  I  will add a picture of the menu the next time we go.  It's a new place in Crowfoot (NW) and we are so happy that we finally have one of our favourite type of food 10 minutes away.  Its Meditaranian  food - you can eat there or take out.
It's also easy for my husband to eat there alone or take out when I'm not home or already ate - and easy to just stop for an easy fast healthy meal lunch or dinner.... 
You've got to try it!!  Vine leaves were also really good!
Oh the backlava is just sweet enough for sweet lovers or non sweet lovers.  I love sweet-  my husband doesn't,   but we were both happy as it was sweet enough for me yet not too sweet for him.  You've got to try this place, it's fantastic. We have only eaten at the Crowfoot restaurant so this review is for the Pita Basket in NW!"}
{"text":"This place hands down is the best in Calgary..!! Ever since I've moved here I could not find a place that had a good shawarma well I found it.. The meat is so tasty humus and tabouli and garlic sauce all rock.. Customer for life.."}
{"text":"Owner takes a lot of pride in what he makes and it shows. Food was amazing and the presentation is always awesome"}
{"text":"The food is so good!! The service is great!  Happy every time I go in.  . The portions are quite large!  I love the do air fries!  But it is definitely a sharing dish"}
{"text":"More impressed by the owner's marketing acumen and his food knowledge.  Asked about the favourites, and he actually gave me a crash course on what the Turkish, Syrians, Iranians, Iraqis all have to offer in terms of cuisine but I digress.

Ordered their chicken shawarma wrap, which can probably compete with red burrito back home in terms of heft, quite filling for just a lunch.  

They also offer catering so like that extra cleanliness touch too.

Good corner location, a bit on the edge of Dt.

Offer shaw wifi.

Closed sundays."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Airdrie to get donairs & shawarma!!!!

Huge portions!

Staff is extremely friendly and have an amazing customer service. 

I would recommend this for a single, a couple or a family! 

Baklava is also extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"A donair shop with free wifi? That's a new one! And yet here it is in downtown Calgary. They've even got specialty coffees on the menu... though I only saw that bit on my way out.

Pita Basket made me a pretty tasty chicken souvlaki wrap yesterday. The small pita was plenty enough! As per usual, I opened this from the wrong end... the twisty end. If you're not a seasoned donair shop eater, take this tip with you or you'll end up with sauce all over your pants (take it from the voice of experience!).

I also had a couple of pieces of baklava to finish off my late lunch. They were alright, but I've been spoiled in the baklava area..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We were served by the owner and he is very proud and passionate about what he does. If you want your meal altered slightly they are very helpful in providing you with great options. We look forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"The food here is so GOOD! Fresh, great flavors, tons of selection... this place definitely stands out for me. 

Compared to other shawarma places, they have a ton of traditional & unique menu options. The garlic fries are addictive! It's always busy so you know it's delicious and very fresh, nothing sits around.

The owner is often there, working hard with his crew. They're generous with their portions for the price, and hand out free samples while you're in line sometimes. Yum!

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great service, good-sized portion, tasty food. I think you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"My new favourite place to eat in Airdrie. Chef Ro is super and take pride in everything that is made at this location. I was never a fan of wraps and pitas until I ate here. Make sure you try the desserts ;)"}
{"text":"Very courteous staff, large portions. A tad pricey. Highly recommended. Watch your legs getting into the booth"}
{"text":"I live very close to this location of the Pita Basket Cafe. I don't go there for their donairs or \"soup of the day\" or any other Falafel food (though I see it's very popular among downtown's business people over the lunch hour). Rather, I go there for the packages of baklava (all 3 sizes, about 8 pieces) for $6. It's such a great deal, I have to stop myself sometimes when I walk past there :d"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch. Their food is always so fresh and tasty, the portions are big, and the service is so friendly every time. I usually get the falafel wrap or plate and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Pita Basket just opened in Crowfoot Crescent (where Wendy's is).  Thought we'd give it a try.  We ordered 3 plates to go - the beef sharwarma, the chicken sharwarma and the donair.

Beef Sharwarma - the meat was fried on the flat top grill and almost cooked to death.  When we got home, the beef was like rubber and found it hard to chew.  The takeout platter includes rice, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, sliced pickles, pickled peppers, hummus, garlic sauce and pita bread.  

Chicken Sharwarma - the chicken was scooped out of a container that was previously cooked and also tough when we got home.  Came with all the same sides.

Donair - the meat was also previously sliced in a container and the meat was at least more edible than the other 2.  Came with the same sides.

I must say I did like the hummus.  Goes well with the pita bread.

We were offered free baklava while waiting for our food to be prepared.  That was good!  Not too sweet.  That enticed me to buy a box of 2 types of baklava for $5.99.  Our desserts were dripping with honey and it was tad too sweet for me.

Not sure if I'll be back.  Hopefully, they improve the meat a bit."}
{"text":"I stopped by today for a lunch and the chef was wonderful. He gave me  a taste of the chicken and beef and before ordering and  i decided on the chicken pita. He prepared it by hand carefully and made a very nice plated serving. It came with fries and a drink for $10.00.  Was lots of food. It was very tasty and filling and i would recommend it to anyone. I cannot wait. To go again and try the beef. Thanks again to get staff."}
