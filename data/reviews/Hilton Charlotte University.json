{"text":"Stayed here for the Thanksgiving Holiday 2015 as the house was overfilled with family and children.

First of all, I will stay here again when visiting the Charlotte area!

This Holiday Inn and the Holiday Day Inn Downtown(uptown) Charlotte have redefined what a Holiday Inn is to me.

Super friendly staff, clean rooms, very comfortable king bed, modern bathroom and modern room. Everything was nice.

The breakfast buffet was great.

Gym was enough the do some damage.

All in all great experience and I'd stay here again."}
{"text":"I was at this hotel for a convention and it was fine.  The meeting rooms were fine.  My hotel room was fine. The restaurant was fine.  The staff was fine. Everything was fine, and I had no real complaints, but for a full service hotel it seemed uninspired.  There was nothing that stood our and impressed me, but I guess that's fine."}
{"text":"Look, it's certainly not the worst hotel you can stay at, there were a couple of things that were annoying. One, the parking was a hassle, too few spots, and even when they covered up a bunch of them with garage pods, they kept the valet spots roped off. Also the front staff could use a bit of sensitivity training, their reaction to my boyfriend and I asking for a single king wasn't necessarily homophobic, but it definitely lacked tact. All this would've been forgiven if the bed weren't so stiff and the pillows so crappy."}
{"text":"Hotel rooms were average, bathrooms were tiny.

Lobby coffee has a $2 charge...we opted to run to Starbucks every day and get great coffee for an extra quarter.

Breakfast buffet was good but with parties of 6 being charged a 20% gratuity for a buffet seemed absurd and ridiculous for someone pouring coffee.

Seemed to nickel and dime their guests at every opportunity and also appeared to be understaffed. We will not bother to stay here again in Charlotte, we could get better service with amenities we are accustomed to at a Hampton or Holiday Inn...disappointed."}
{"text":"This is not the place to stay for a weekend get away. They are often way too booked on events which of course doesn't cater to resident guests. This evening there are 2 weddings 2 family reunions and on sweet 15 party. It felt like a made house. Please I employ you to find a better place to stay on your weekend get away."}
{"text":"Nice staff, my room seemed a little run down with a broken desk but it was all clean."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a wedding, also members of IHG, it was wonderful!
So many things to do!
So many sights to c!
Will b coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this to alert Hilton that the ventilation fans in back of this hotel are egregiously noisy, and the situation needs to be remedied. This level of noise makes sleep difficult."}
{"text":"We chose this hotel for a family weekend getaway. We were not disappointed!  The customer service was great from the moment we walked in!  The rooms were clean and well kept. Ask for a room with a lake view if you can get it. The hotel is within walking distance of a shopping area with a variety of restaurants and entertainment spots! There is an outdoor pool at the hotel and we found kid friendly activities nearby. There are restaurants in the hotel although we did not try them on this trip. It would have been even better if there was a small gift shop in the hotel but that was a minor thing."}
{"text":"Stayed at this Hilton during my most recent work trip & have to say I was quite impressed

Super plush room, super comfy bed, pillows, coffeemaker, fridge, awesome water pressure & lovely, smelly bath products.  Free wifi

Only reason this wasn't a 5-star review was due to their obscenely awful flood lights that illuminate the building.  My room was right above these lights & even with the blackout curtains, it was like daylight in my room.... which equaled NO sleep for me

Kept waking up, thinking I'd overslept only to find out it was 1am, 2am, you get the picture. 

Not sure if the higher floors experience this but the 5th floor was brutal!"}
{"text":"Family went to Charlotte, NC, for the weekend for a childhood friend's wedding. None of us have ever been there nor have family close by. My parents stayed at Courtyard by Marriott and my brother stayed at Hilton. Since I've stayed in Courtyard by Marriott before, I was curious about Hilton. The only thing I know about Hilton is that it's own by Paris Hilton's great grandfather lol. 

The staff is friendly. Check in is by 3 pm but we wanted to check in earlier and was able to at noon. After checking in the Hilton, we walked around the hotel. It's really nice. The hotel is located across The Boardwalk (shopping, restaurant, lake). Enterprise and Starbucks are inside the hotel too. The lower level has many  rooms for parties and meetings. 

I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very clean and comfortable room with a great team here. Walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops as well. Beautiful views at night and easy access to the highway. This was a great stay in the middle of a long trip."}
{"text":"Hotel got nice lobby, but I found Bugs in my room! (Show an in picture). I'm here for one night for work trip and found these bugs in my room. Also two dead ones laying on the bathroom floor. It's gross, but I'm really tired and didn't want to bother to switch room since I have to get up at 4am for work. I dragged out the sheets and flip thru the pillows to make sure there aren't bugs in my bed. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"I was extremely dissatisfied, on Friday night we held an event in the University Ball Room. Our event took up 3 section, another event was held in 1 other section and 1 section inbetween us. The group in the other section was extremely loud to the point we could not hear our event speakers at all. I complained to our Banquet Captain at least 6 times about the noise level. He said he would ask the other group to turn their speakers down and it continued to get louder. The Banquet Manager or Captain were no help at all. I also had problems when it was time for the dinner portion of our event. We gave the Banquet Captain exact table numbers and seating numbers, where our vegetarians and gluten free guest were located. And they still seem to give our guest the wrong food. After noticing they were given the wrong food, I looked for the Banquet Captain and he was no where to be found. I am extremely disappointed with the way things went at our event!"}
{"text":"I sometimes wonder how people live. This is by far not a 4 or 5 star hotel; maybe it was 10 years go. This is a failed attempt at a hotel renovation. The website takes magnificent pictures giving the illusion of a grand hotel that overlooks the water. Not so much! There is a small tourist area with a pond but nothing as picturesque. 

I was very disappointed in my bathroom. While some parts were renovated some were not. The area of the toilet has clear water damage they chose not to complete the boards were buckling and I wouldn't be surprised if there were mold. If you are in 311 beware."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel, clean rooms, exceptional staff and great location!

What more can you ask for! This is a wonderful hotel, with clean rooms, modern d√©cor and what makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. They are courteous, friendly and went above and beyond in making our stay very comfortable. 
The location was awesome, having the boardwalk with shops and restaurants right out the back door made it so convenient.  And the beautiful lake to walk around for some exercise and fresh air! And easy access to the freeway. 
I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Bed was amazing. Water pressure was awful. Parking was easy we did vallet. The convention we went to held here was way to big for this hotel. Most the staff was friendly and polite. One person at esculators was rude and yelled at us for being in costume. I think that employee should not work a convention that is open to costuming. We were shocked at how uncalled for that was. Sadly it was to crowded and a mess to report the person who yelled at us for nothing.  But the rest of the staff, our room, etc was nice. Would we come back? For a normal regular stay yes but not another convention there. We perfer the Hilton Garden Inn near downtown for normal stays. No indoor pool was shocked. Did not try food or room service. Poor Starbucks employee was alone during a huge event unsure who staffed that poorly we tipped her well."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved, my stay! Staff so super friendly and accommodating. Room well kept, luv luv luv my view of the water! Only problem was I wished the WiFi was completely free for guest. As they have limited free WiFi meaning no streaming which is DUMB"}
{"text":"We stayed here last month when going to a concert.  They were extremely professional and welcoming!  Our room was ready and very clean.  We were even upgraded.  I'm a Gold Hilton Honors Member, so they called up to ask if there was anything they could do to help us.  We really enjoyed our stay!  The beds were very comfy, and the restaurant was great as well!"}
{"text":"House keeping comes seriously early and only knocks once before coming in. Im checking out today and waiting for my group, after working 20 hours and the front desk guy came up to me and rudely said I can't sleep in the lobby... Im nicely dressed sitting upright and I dozed off for a few minutes from being so exhausted. When I explained I'm a guest he didn't care and was adamant i can't doze off again because \"people are asking questions\" from that unkindness I won't stay here ever again. If I was an 80 year old woman would he have said the same thing? No, he wouldn't have."}
{"text":"We loved this hotel! Stayed here for NASCAR ALL STAR race for 2 nights! Beautiful room & views. Bed was very comfy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hotel needs an upgrade. The A/C is load and feels like someone is kicking the door when it turns on. Towel rack came falling off the wall too. The good part is that at least the staff was nice when we checked in and helped as well when we forgot something in the room."}
{"text":"Another great Hilton experience. Staff is great.  

Free Wi-fi and a fitness center open 24 hours.  Precor equipment, weights, benches, four treadmills and three ellipicals.  For some reason it seems extra-humid in the fitness center, but since most people are there to sweat, I guess it's okay.

Outlets in the room exactly where I need them and I love the little coffee and tea maker. 

Classy bar/restaurant on site with good food! The bathrooms here are a little small compared to the newer locations that I have stayed at, but they are still a decent size. 

Great view of the lake, easy to get to and walk around the shops and restaurants. The executive lounge is great and I hope to get upgraded next time I stay! =) 

I will continue to stay here any time I am back in Charlotte for work."}
{"text":"PROS:
_____

- Up to par and friendly, professional staffs at front desk, executive lounge, and parking attendants. They do their very best to accommodate your needs all the time.

- Convenient location and easy access to many restaurants and stores.

- Most rooms are clean and up to basic standards.

- Fully equipped with wifi, fitness center, business center, bar, car rental, etc on site.

CONS:
----------

- Ventilation and temperature in the small fitness center is always musky and warm to too warm.

- Not so professional housekeeping staff. They are always loud and chatty during mornings in the hallways thru the very thin walls. One time they even knocked when I had a 'Do no disturb' sign out on the door.

- No AC nor air ventilation in the elevators.

- Slower wifi and VERY poor signal strength in certain rooms. It's free though. It would better if there is alternative pay wifi with better performance or just upgrade the existing wifi.

- Cannot fax in business center. Only via front desk staff. Not so convenient with sensitive or confidential documents."}
{"text":"Ok, I just ate a science project. It al started when I ordered the calamari, trout and a cranberry on the rocks shaken not stirred. Took forever to get my complicated drink but the calamari is what did me in. I'm watching Dallas vs. OKC and I heard a knock during the break and I looked around and couldn't figure where the knocking sound was coming from. Game is getting good OKC has a 14 pt lead and the music for the break comes on... I hear the knocking again... So I reach inside the bag and the calamari is beating on the plastic Togo box. So I opened it and holy smokes it starts doing the wave to the NBA songs. I grab a fork and what the hell I ate it and now I understand why it was still moving. It had that much salt on it!!! Like one of the science projects from high school. My blood pressure is up in the air like Kim Kardashian's legs (sorry Yessy) up like unemployment in the black community (I'm black I can say that) up like my uncle Willie on Viagra at 6am... I went to my aunt Helens room and stole one of her high blood pressure pills. Had hurtle over uncle Willie to get to them but I'm better now. Hey chef... Lay off the got damn salt, are you trying to kill me?!?!? (Disclaimer) the food did not move it was merely an analogy to express how much salt was on the food. #NaCl."}
{"text":"Check-in at the Hilton University Place was a breeze. A very modern reception desk wit a more than courteous employee handled our reserved room with ease. Unfortunately, that is about where the good ended.

After arriving to our room, which was adequate and about what would be expected for a Hilton property, we went to get some ice. The ice machine on our floor didn't work, so it was an elevator trip up to the next floor. That would be an elevator that took about 5 minutes to arrive. Mind you, this was at around 1:00 PM on a Saturday afternoon, not typically a busy time. We got our ice, took the stairs back to our room and relaxed before dinner.

We decided to have dinner a the hotel restaurant, The Fountainview. We arrived and a sign said to wait to be seated. The restaurant was completely empty. When I say empty, I mean nobody, no diners, no staff, nobody. We called out and looked around the corner at the bar and the server there said to take a seat anywhere and she would bring us menus. Three un-bussed tables greeted us when we walked in. We say by the window with a great view of the lake and waited....and waited...and waited. Finally, because we decided to just head over to the Edgewater Bar and Grille and eat there. We sat down and watched as the bartender did nothing and the one server they had rushed around, trying to take care of everyone. We ordered our drinks, which did arrive promptly, and then ordered dinner. A basic cheeseburger and a flatbread. After almost 20 minutes, the food arrived. THe flatbread was, at best, room temperature and not browned at all. The burger, which was listed as having bacon and onions (requested to hold the onions) came with no bacon. I sent back the flatbread. It came back about 5 minutes later, this time with brown edges, but the crust was still doughy. Based on the speed of service, we went ahead and ordered a piece of cake well before we would have been ready. It never came. Finally, we told the server to scratch the cake and simply bring us the check. She came back with the cake saying it was up, but she then took it off our bill due to the wait. She was more than gracious and apologetic. By this time (around 6:15 PM) every table was filled there was still only the one server and non-helpful bartender. We paid and left, completely unsatisfied with the meal.

Fast forward to the next day. We wake up to find our room at 76 degrees though the thermostat was set for 70 and the fan on auto. We gathered our things to check out. Turns out, 1 elevator was out of service, so for some reason, the one next to it couldn't run. I walked down to check out, while my wife waited, with our luggage, on the elevator. 15 minutes later, she arrived. She let me know that several people on the elevator mentioned how warm their rooms were and the some had 15-20 minute wait time for the elevator.

In summary, I would expect so much more from a Hilton property. I have stayed here before and the elevators have been an issue for quite awhile. However, the other issues with the A/C, the horrible service and food quality, when combined with the known elevator issues, make it absolutely impossible for me to recommend the Hilton University Place"}
{"text":"Just an okay experience that skews to the downside. First, the positive. The location is perfect with the hotel surrounded by many retail shops and restaurants and just minutes from I-85. It is also situated around a man-made lake which is picturesque. Although the rooms are in decent shape, they could be a bit cleaner and the walls are thin. These unpleasant nuances are trivial and completely habitable. However,  you are essentially on your own after you check in. I called the front desk twice and the phone rang for an uncomfortable amount of time with no answer. When I went downstairs to inform them our sink was clogged and request extra towels they did not respond until we followed up many hours later. The sink was never fixed. They also do not replenish toiletries, e.g., lotion,  shampoo, etc. when they clean up the room."}
{"text":"I have to comment on the customer service at this hotel. We always stay here when visiting our boys who attend UNCC & they just keep getting better at what they do. This is a large chain hotel that handles each guest with the grace & personal service of a first class B&B. Marieta Bryan, their Guest Loyalty Manager, is amazing. I'll never stay anywhere else when I come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Bar non one of my favorite hotels for business travel. Nicest and accommodating staff at check in. 

Ultra clean rooms. They know how to treat a diamond member. I will be back."}
{"text":"The hotel was incredible. The staff could not have been nicer, and with 4 Family Reunions and a Pro Wrestling convention, everything was kept organized and could not have went better.  I will definitely be back again next year."}
{"text":"Very NICE hotel!  I have stayed here twice and all  things wanted in a great hotel they have!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here for one Saturday night. We checked in via the mobile app and selected our room (1034). We were able to skip the front desk and head straight to our room. 

The room was a good size, clean and had a lot of light. The view was nothing special, just the parking lot and highway. 

The bathroom is TINY. There is barely a centimeter to spare between the door and toilet seat. Very uncomfortable and cramped. The bathroom DID have a fan though, the Hilton's finally answered my many requests! 

There was a HUGE booger on the wall by the mirror in the room, absolutely disgusting but thankfully it wasn't in a place where you had to get close to it. Luckily we were just here for the night!

We left around 4pm and were going to print some concert tickets, the printer in the lobby doesn't work though. There was complete chaos in the lobby at this time too so we couldn't find anyone to help.

Didn't eat breakfast or interact with any staff during our stay so I can't offer an opinion on that.

Side note, floor 10 (and probably above that) are the Hilton Honors floors so after hours you have to present your room key or mobile key to access those floors in the elevator. It took a while for some reason, it wouldn't read our mobile key so that was frustrating after a long day."}
{"text":"Recently updated, this hotel is my choice for putting up guests in the University area of Charlotte. Great staff and cool surroundings."}
{"text":"Recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly.    The lounge is nice touch but not enough to overcome the staffs lack of detail and follow through.    Will give this place one last shot but not holding me breath"}
{"text":"I don't usually have the opportunity to meet clients in the university area, but was greatly delighted with this Hilton. The atrium/ lobby areas are wonderful, comfortable, worthy of the Hilton name and a delight for my clients. Their suite was second to none, almost had me forget that I wasn't the guest, and ready to kick off my shoes.  I will readily recommend this location to any visiting clients in the future."}
{"text":"Oh my what a grand hotel. Just want to thank Shanee Murray for suggesting dinner and super bowl fun here. Came here for 1st half of the super bowl. Hotel restaurant on premises. It rules. Good food, awesome service, clean beyond description. Homemade bread pudding for boo. Nice super bowl crowd. Go Eagles"}
{"text":"This is supposedly the most upscale hotel in the University area.  It's right off WT Harris Blvd which is always busy.  It is the most distinguishable hotel in the area too at 12+ floors.  It looks a bit outdated on the outside but has been remodeled nicely on the inside . 

I stayed here twice in the past 3 months for business travel.  My first experience in January 2015 was 5 stars all around.  I was on the Hilton Honors floor in which you need your room key to access from the elevators.  Our room was spacious and overlooked the man-made lake.  We had a fridge and microwave and a large bathroom. There were electrical outlets next to the beds and on all the lamp fixtures.  However my  stay last week was not as great as the first.  I ended up in a handicap-enabled room which wasn't too bad but definitely a downgraded experience from the last.  The electrical outlets at the desk did not work so I had to work on the nightstand next to my bed. Our door didn't shut all the way unless we slammed it shut.

Breakfast is generally not complimentary but my work had negotiated free breakfast in our rate.  I really like the breakfast here.  Hot breakfast options include eggs, country potatoes, pancakes, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and bacon.  There's also an omelet station in which the chef will cook whatever omelet you wanted. There was also bagels and muffins if you wanted something quick.  There is also a cafe in the lobby area that serves Starbucks coffee and to-go pastries/drinks. 

This hotel is close to everything.  Bars, restaurants, banks, shopping, Walgreens, everything. There is no parking fee per night with plenty of parking.  Valet service is also offered. 

I would definitely consider this hotel again when I'm back in Charlotte for work."}
{"text":"I would love to review this hotel but they overbooked and gave my room away. And so we went from The Hilton to the Holiday Inn and it seems there was nothing we can do about it. It was either that or a $50 voucher. $50!!!! We drove 4 hours to get here and they will only give us $50 for giving away our room!!! Just in customer service alone it's a '-1' stars unfortunately that's not available."}
{"text":"Reliable hotel with nice amenities and a beautiful pond off the back, great for a morning run or evening stroll. We stayed for a wedding, and there were two or three other family reunions there also, so the lobby was almost consistently overrun. Staff could have been more friendly, though I'd give them the benefit of the doubt given all of the chaos. Easy access to shops, restaurants, and the highway. Would stay again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Recently, I came here for a conference.  The hosting organization did a superb job by selecting this awesome hotel!

This hotel is conveniently located in the midst of restaurants, stores, and whatnots.  There's an awesome pond in the back with even more restaurants.

The hotel itself is spacious with ample space for exhibits, registration, and socialization.  The rooms for workshops were impressive, allowing a large number of participants to attend.  

The room was nice and decent.  Nothing fancy.  The beds were a little too soft for my liking.  Throughout the night, I just could not sleep.  Tossed and turned.  Folded pillows in half.  

The staff were friendly and helpful.  

I'll be back next summer as another hosting organization will have a conference there!"}
{"text":"I haven't stayed here in a few years. ALWAYS had a great stay. This time, it was just run down.Needs serious remodeling. The clientele was less than desired. Loud, rude,foul mouthed. 

It's just gone down hill along with everything else in the area."}
{"text":"First impression was that the outside looks very outdated compared to the pictures shown online. The inside was much nicer. Lobby was very crowded and waited over 10 minutes to get checked in (by someone I could not understand with her accent). I guess if you want to pay an extra $50-$75 you can have a lake view, we only stayed one night so didn't really care. Pool was swarmed with young children. Room and bed were clean. Wifi was slow and walls seem to be pretty thin. No 'real' complaints but wasn't particularly wowed by a hilton. Would stay again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I booked a room on the executive floor for new years. We got here right at check out time and we were told it would be another 20 minutes before the room was ready....an hour later, here we are in our room with a bath tub that the paint is chipping off of and the tv doesn't work. We were charged for a movie that we can't even watch. Highly dissapointed. You would think that with a big name like Hilton, the room and service would be superior. Very lackluster."}
{"text":"Clean rooms and comfortable beds.  Sometimes parking can a bit of a hassle.   Front desk staff always friendly.  My room was recently redone.  Great location."}
{"text":"stayed here for 3 nights, and is our company preferred hotel. the interior was modern, and the employees were very friendly and helpful. i checked in during the late night, and immediately asked for a refrigerator. it was brought up promptly (i could hear her asking him as i was walking back to my floor through a walkie-talkie). room service food here is bleh. i ordered the tomato basil soup (he gave me a large side since i didn't get the grilled cheese that it normally comes with) and it wasn't even WARM! waste of $7. the pesto chicken panini would've been good (it was a bit odd since it also had asparagus) but the bread was totally burned. the fries were good, and they forgot my ranch, but he came up with 2 right away after i called.

my favorite part of this hotel is that it faces the man made lake, which is a great view for me to enjoy while on the terrace in front of their bar/restaurant. weather was great this week, and enjoyed a lot of nights with the breeze with some bubbly & wine. its also within walking distance to some shops and restaurants, and was able to burn off that southern food walking laps around the lake. also nice to see ducks, swans, etc.

the room - it was standard size, although i was at the very end around a corner. the ice machine didnt work on our floor, but i was tired of asking for things. :) the bed was comfy, but not as comfy as i thought it would be considering it was \"pillowtop\". the worst were the pillows. they were all goose/feather down, and even with 2, i was so uncomfortable as my head sunk into them. i also couldnt turn off the fan, and im such a light sleeper that i could not sleep well the first 2 days because it was so incredibly loud.

their basic tv channels are all fuzzy, i am not sure why, so that was annoying. their alarm clock, you can't change the hour, so i always used the wakeup call service, which never failed.

we also received a free full breakfast buffet, and there was a variety of things (same everyday). biscuits/gravy (delicious!), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, grits, cereal, yogurt, and we always opted for the make your own omelette station. it was great, except for the 2nd day when i asked for egg whites and got the regular eggs. oh well. great service other than that.

would stay again for the convenience factor, as they have a shuttle service to our office (5 minute ride)."}
{"text":"Older Hilton property but seemed nice. Got a nice upgrade with a nice view of the lake outside. Executive lounge is nice and service good. Got a good rate so would stay here again."}
{"text":"Accomindations nice.  Staff very friendly.  Very service oriented.  Neg....there is NOT \"cute\" shops nearby.  They are empty....TV..not HD.or digital...looks lie your typical antenna.  Service makes up for it.  Great folks.  Free Wifi..Marriott charges $13/night."}
{"text":"I had my family reunion here recently and was very pleased with the hotel. The banquet staff as well as the sales and catering staff were very helpful and my family reunion was a success. The hotel was extremely busy that weekend so I was very surprised that they were able to a meet our specific request. I did not stay in a room , but my family didn't have any complaints about the room or facilities. They also enjoyed the free parking as well as the close proximity of restaurants and shops.  This hotel is a good alternative to the pricey ones uptown .. you are a short 15 min drive away from most of the major areas of Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to stay when I'm in Charlotte. As soon as I walk in the front door and head to the front desk, I hear a voice say welcome back. I'm only in town maybe 8 to 10 times a year but it's nice when someone remembers your face. A special accolade to Jonathan Wilson.  He is such a breathe of fresh air.  I always enjoy going to the Executive Lounge.  sherry Williams knows me by name and the conversation and food is awesome.  Hilton is still the Gold standard.  The staff really makes the difference."}
{"text":"I've stayed here a number of times and have always had suitable accommodations and a pleasant stay. I was a bit disappointed this stay to receive my emailed bill a day before my departure and when I called to inquire (and ensure that my room and my stuff would still be there when I returned in the evening), I was told that my reservation was only for two nights, not three - which wasn't the case.  The very pleasant young man said he'd take care of it though and extend my stay. Not wanting to let it go, we called back to understand what happened and apparently someone else checked out and the front desk person miskeyed my room number.  What would have happened had I not been on email that morning and realized the mistake?  You might need to put some controls in place around that, Hilton. Other than that, my stay was just fine.  Clean and comfortable room, nice common areas, and I love the digital key functionality!  No waiting in line to check-in...do it all on your phone and go straight to your room!  Fabulousness!"}
{"text":"The best part of this hotel is the Boardwalk area behind it.  In the Boardwalk, you'll find some restaurant. Not all great, but you can get out and roam around a little. 

The rooms are standard. No biggie.

The concierge lounge is ok. Evening reception is ok, some samosas and cheese. No free booze.  Breakfast is so-so.. no eggs and bacon. Coffee is so so.  Kinda dissapointed with the concierge lounge.  I think I'll go somewhere else next week.

Back to to Boardwalk area, great place for kids. They have a play ground. There is a lake and you can rent a paddle boat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hotels in the university area.  Not only is the staff very friendly - but also adept (these are often mutually exclusive).  Although I'm not a Hilton Honors Gold Club Member, I was upgraded on my recent visit to an executive suite, which had the advantage of free continental breakfasts and managers receptions in the evening (hor d'ouvres every night, wine and beer on Wednesdays).  The view on over the lake is beautiful, and the hotel is located close to many restaurant options.  You don't have to venture out to get a good meal though, the room-service and sit-down restaurant are both excellent - any of their steaks are great with the Bearnaise sauce!  Heck, even if your not having steak try the Bearnaise sauce!

As usual, with Hilton, the rooms themselves are nice quality, efficient units.... and although this might not be everyone's priority when searching for a hotel I love the Hilton sheets and towels."}
{"text":"The dollar signs for pricing don't really apply here as the dollar tiers are for restaurants.

I'd stay here again for sure next time in town for work.  That's the bottom line, but for more details, I specifically enjoyed/recommend this place because:

-Clean, comfortable rooms that are modern.
-Terrific breakfast buffet.
-Friendly front desk staff.

My room didn't have great water pressure and other guests were loud from time to time, but the first thing is luck of the draw and the second...as long as it doesn't last isn't a shocker."}
{"text":"First impression, people in the lobby were nice greeted us as we made our way to the elevator. i e-checked in. Two rooms, at first sight rooms looks big and spacious, no complimentary bottle water in any rooms. went to the bathroom and it was a tiny little closet, do not try to have two people in the bathroom, toilet and sink met together. first bathroom had a loud vent. That went on all night, our room had two beds so my roommate that was sleeping next to it didn't mind so we didn't complain. Bathroom wall bath bar is broken, again roommate didn't want to change room. Second bathroom toilet is peeling and pee stain all over it. Turned on sink and water is brown but after we let it run it was clear. Rooms had Big beautiful window but Curtains had food stains on it. Night stand light is super bright. Next morning I wanted to go have breakfast turned out e-key doesn't work in executive level, even though i am a gold member and had access. Went to lobby I was ask for ID, room is under roommates name, roommate is sleeping even though I had an electronic key, that I showed the agent at the desk. didn't want to wake up my roommate so I said forget about breakfast, safety reasons I understand. Next morning woke up no running water called front desk water is shut down until 12:30.  No notifications and we had somewhere to go, saw housekeeping stated that I should have received a note under my door, no note two rooms no notificationS, I ask her for a bottle of water to brush my teeth. Water came on around 12:45 waited 15 minutes for it to stop being brown. One more night, staffs are great from house keeping to front desk. I know some stuff were beyond their controls. This hotel is old and need a better upkeep. I need my shower and clean water, that's like a No no for me. Love the Hilton but I will not be staying at that one again unless some changes are made. It is a Great location, beautiful surroundings as well. So many places to eat. The man made lake is beautiful, there is a park for the kiddies, paddle boating as well and sprinklers. Parking can be hard to find if it's not valet"}
{"text":"The rooms are decent, quiet.  oh you stay on 10,11,12 you have executive lounge access.  They do a decent job, caprese etc instead of just the normal frozen/fried nibbles.

The courtesy shuttle is great and also within very short walking distance there is plenty of shopping."}
{"text":"a beautiful hotel that was just renovated. The best service i have had at a hotel..... A great pleace to have our wedding, we got married overlooking the lake 

the restaurnat has the best crab cake i have ever had and that includes ones i have had in Baltimore 

just a great hotel"}
{"text":"The rooms are clean, but a little worn out.  Free self parking (a big plus).  Breakfast buffet is very nice, but expensive.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Worst hotel experience of my entire life. 

Came here for an event being held at this hotel - I'll try to make my review shorter than a novel. 

Check in fine
Room fine (although, not vacuumed well, found someone's bobby pin on carpet.  Not mine!) 
Room service fine

9:15 am return from breakfast at local IHOP 

ALL FOUR ELEVATORS BROKEN.  Daughter and I had to walk NINE FLIGHTS UP.  Did I mention asthma?  Oh yes, daughter has severe asthma...

Get to room.  Power to hotel goes out.  No power.  No tv, a/c, WiFi, zip. 

After waiting 1/2 hour to see if power comes back on, call front desk.  I was told, this happens all of the time, due to Charlotte rail line work...I said, can you comp me the room?  No power, no elevators, etc.  Tell them daughter has asthma, had to make it up nine flights. Was told, we don't comp, sorry. 

We ended up leaving hotel as the event had no power - we had to walk down nine flights using only an iPhone flashlight as the hotel stairs had no emergency lighting!  As we got to about fourth floor, in the pitch blackness of the stairwell, we smell smoke!  

We raced down the stairs, go to front desk, turn keys in and explain everything that just happened - no lights in stairwell, no power, no elevators.  Again, ask nicely to be comped - no sympathy.  Come to find out, fire trucks were there and people were stuck in ALL FOUR ELEVATORS! 

Absolutely worst experience at a hotel ever.  Hilton, you should be ashamed.  No concern for safety of your patrons or employees.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I attended a conference here for work, so I can't comment on the rooms themselves. The lobby area is nicely renovated, and I appreciated the seating areas overlooking the lake and boardwalk. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, but heads up that they do not take Starbucks gift cards. 

The conference room space was okay. Not enough restrooms for ladies for the space capacity. Buffet breakfast, lunch, and snacks were provided as part of the conference rate, but the layout of the space does not leave much room for buffet setup. The servers were accommodating, but it was pretty chaotic and crowded. The food itself was typical hotel/hall-style and just okay."}
{"text":"Stayed at this hotel on 4/1/17. Great location near restaurants and shopping. The hotel was nice and clean but unfortunately our stay was anything but pleasant. A major fight broke out on our floor ---at 3 AM---- which resulted in cops being called. Males and females were screaming, cursing, fighting, etc. This scared my kids half to death. Any minute it seemed like bullets could've started flying by the way they were behaving. Even after the cops left, it went on for another 15-20 min!!!!!

Afterwards this same group started blasting the music so loud that I had to call the front desk again in which they said security was already called up there by another hotel patron. 
It was a horrific night and none of us got a decent night's sleep!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because we put our breakfast door request out. It was not there in the morning and our breakfast was never delivered. Very disappointing. There was no time to wait around on them to correct their mistake. The room was clean and basic. The coffee maker was dis functional so we didn't even get a cup o joe. Half the water came out in the cup the other half poured out into the tray underneath. Total hazard because the plug was right there. Scary. The front check-in staff was friendly and inviting. The room was really nice, the bed was comfortable, we slept well. Large flat screen tv, desk, table, chair, roomy. The cleaning staff on our floor was actually taking to each other loudly as one was at one end of hallway and one at the other. Kinda funny. I hope no one was trying to sleep. All in all it is a nice hotel. I suggest calling in your breakfast order ahead of time instead of depending on the door knocker ordering system. Hilton Honors guest receive free waters upon arrival."}
{"text":"I came here due to my poor experience at Comfort Inn Suites down the street. It was a much better experience. The room was clean, nice, and comfortable, the staff was friendly, they had great amenities including a coffee shop. Didn't eat here so I can't say anything about that."}
{"text":"I attended a week-long convention at the hotel. Front desk staff is polite for the most part but, at one point, when asked for change for a 10 dollar bill, the clerk told me rather abruptly to go to the bar.

I could not get the attention of the bartender and never got my change. I ended up having to bum a couple bucks from a friend for the Domino's driver's tip. The front desk clerk did not even bother asking me if I wanted singles or fives. It was just a dismissive, \"We don't have change. Go to the bar.\"

Nice rooms. Refrigerator, Keurig coffee maker, big desk, VERY comfortable bed with good pillows.

The hotel's meeting room set up is good, but the food was really awful all the way through. Tasteless and unappetizing are just two of the terms I can use to describe the food. Just about everyone in my party complained about the food, and most of us didn't eat much. 

The beef on the Mexican buffet set up for my group the first day was stringy, tough and gamy. The Italian buffet the second day was completely tasteless. The only thing that most people enjoyed was the macaroni and cheese served the third day. The chicken pot pie tasted like they dropped a bucket of salt into it. The pecan pie was good. The cheesecake was awful. 

I was finally driven to desperation (I was starving) to order pizza from Domino's, hence my need for change (tip money for the driver).

I am a lower-level Hilton Honors member (Silver). In any Hilton hotel, I am supposed to get just a few perks, including a bottle of water. Not once was my Silver status acknowledged. They couldn't even be bothered to provide a bottle of water. 

The hotel sent me a survey after my stay. I filled it out and mentioned the Hilton Honors thing. I got an email back that basically said, \"Oh, well...but we are glad you liked the bed!\" Whatever. They could have spared the effort of even responding to the survey. The response was almost more insulting than anything.

Two stars only because the room was nice. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stayed on 8 floor, for 4 nights, had to call down every single night at 12:30am-1am and ask them to shut the music off outside.  Seriously?  They were playing some drum and bass that would slightly rattle the windows.

Expensive in comparison to the other hotels around the area.

Friendly staff, but having to call down 4 nights in a row

Free wireless"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Got to the hotel at almost midnight after deciding not to drive home for the night and they had a great room for an excellent price. Very happy with my stay! Comfy beds!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice hotel located near UNC Charlotte.   The hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  The rooms are fairly large equipped with a large HD TV, refrigerator, and Kurig coffee maker.  The bath is adequate though not overly large.  The beds are some of the best I've slept in!  Terrific mattresses, pillows, and bedding.  You will get a good night's sleep here.

The hotel is very close to the Interstate and UNC Charlotte not only making it convenient, but also out of the Charlotte traffic.  There are a few local restaurants as well as a number of chain restaurants.   The finest restaurant may be located in the hotel, though I did not dine there so I can't really say.

My one negative is that the WiFi is horrible.  No one in our party could get web pages to load via the WiFi so we all gave up on it."}
{"text":"Bernard the bellman and Briana, at the front desk gave really great Customer service. I was disappointed in the University Center shops that had absolutely nothing to offer in the way of restaurants. The room reminded me of a Hampton Inn, which is not horrible. I usually stay at Hampton Inn for a lot less money. This just was not the experience that had hoped for from The Hilton. The morning breakfast that I paid for was very disappointing too. Ordered an egg white omelette that was really not worth the extra $10.00 That I paid. I guess that I need to check out other properties if I am looking for an upgrade from Hampton Inn because The Hilton was a disappointing stay."}
{"text":"The room was perfectly fine and lived up to the Hilton name, the staff even put custom memory foam pillows in our room because we had saved our preferences in the Hilton app.  That being said, don't bother asking them for a cot because apparently this hotel does not do that.  My poor friend ended up sleeping in a chair."}
{"text":"While this is a decent hotel, you will not sleep a wink due to noise. You can hear everything. The neighbors in the shower, other customers walking down the hall, a door slam many rooms over, etc.

Do not stay here isyou are a light sleeper. 

Staff is friendly and timely with any any requests."}
{"text":"Hilton Charlotte delivers on Southern Hospitality!  From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted with smiles and charm.  Quick rundown:

-Rooms are nice and mine was up on 7 overlooking the lake...I found this to be comforting since my body clock is all screwed up.  Waking up at 5am that's really 2am isnt so bad when you get to see the sun come up from the spectacular view.

-Restaurant & Room Service---top notch.  Oh how I heart sweet tea.  The pizza, NY steak, salads and most of all desserts were out-of-this-world.  Creme Brulee Cheesecake and Granny Smith Apple Pie with shortbread crust and toffee sauce....come on now.


Only complaints and minus a star...they should make it so people don't line up right outside the front doors smoking.  Oh the rooms have a 2 inch gap under the door?  What do you do  (A-hit it just a lil bit softer lol jk)

I'll be back next month....will most likey stay here again."}
{"text":"I attended an event this past weekend in the Lakeview Room.  Due to the weather we booked a room and checked in around 5:00.  Check-in was easy, but upon arriving in our room it was nice, but one disappointing thing, they did not provide a blow dryer. I used to bring mine to every hotel, but most hotels I stay in recently provide one. The one time I decide not to, they don't provide.  I was able to call the lobby and have one brought up to me.

The event started at 7:00 and upon entering the Lakeview room, it was very outdated.  Although it has a great view of the lake outside, the carpet, seating and overall look of the room could definitely use a makeover.  A buffet was set up along one wall and unfortunately the food was SO disappointing I could not eat too much.  The serving dishes did not seem to remain hot so everything served, from stuffed mushrooms, chicken, to pasta was all cold. And, everything didn't have any flavor.  There was, however, a chicken and waffle station set up in one corner, which was cooked to order so that was at least warm, but was okay.

After the event we went to the hotel bar, which had a good crowd.  However, they seemed to run out of several wines we requested and the service was slow.
I did however sleep very well and enjoyed the breakfast brunch that was set up in the lobby Sunday morning and was ony $12.99.
Overall, it was a nice stay, but definitely outdated and the food could definitely use some work."}
{"text":"Lovely stay, but the downside of leaving on Sunday morning is the lack of luggage carts and more than two people can lug by themselves.  Doesn't checking out happen every day?"}
{"text":"Nice place to stay by mans made lake with good walking area and stores & restaurants. Nice room, comfy bed. Nice bathroom except the tub has a really slow drain. Restaurant being remodeled at the time of my visit so breakfast buffet is congested. Traffic in this area is pretty bad at rush hour."}
{"text":"Came here for ConCarolinas. Miserable failure of a hotel. Be prepared to spend money on everything. And don't forget the up front security deposit they don't mention before you can get your room keys. The room I stayed in had a horrible caulking job around the ceiling and in our closet a ceiling panel fell out."}
{"text":"This is a great hotel in a fabulous location.  It's on a man made river  surrounded by Restaurants and shops . The hotel staff tried to do everything to make your stay comfortable.  When I arrived I needed to pick up an item at the grocery store.  Bill drove me back and forth to the store with the hotel shuttle .  

The fitness center in the hotel is small , however it provides fruit and power bars . It also provided complimentary ear buts for the TV's .  

The room is large and comfortable. It is equipped with the standard microwave,refrigerator and coffee pot.  

It has a nice terrace off the bar that you could get a drink and look at the water and fountain. 

A nice touch was the ability for me to pick my room before checkin. I also was able to unlock  my room with my phone."}
