{"text":"Place good, if u want good homemade authentic Mexican breakfast come here... Salsa is amazing , the service is ok, but that's expected kinda cuz this place is busy all the time .. I'll be back"}
{"text":"There breakfast is just like grandma made it. The BEST. They also have the best  banana & chocolate liquado (Blended milk, banana, & choco mix). The best of all there prices are very cheap."}
{"text":"Real Sonoran food with friendly neighborhood vibe. Try the chilaquiles and the frijoles refritos. The horchata is also great."}
{"text":"Finally. A Phoenix Mexican restaurant that knows that chilaquiles are more than chips with a couple of ladles of sauce poured over them.

Chilaquiles are not fancy or difficult food, which makes the lackadaisical approach taken by a lot of Phoenix restaurants somewhat baffling. El Horseshoe does them up right by taking a couple of minutes to simmer the chips in the sauce, letting them absorb some of the chile goodness, before putting them on the plate. 

Here, the approach to this very simple dish, is well, simple. Once plated, the sauced chips are sprinkled with a goodly amount of queso anejo, and that's it. No crema (though, it might be available upon request) and no garnish. I ordered mine with a fried egg (for an extra charge), which came served on the side. The delicious, hearty, and sneaky hot green sauce will make itself known to your mouth's tender bits when you're about halfway through the dish."}
{"text":"Authentic machaca and homemade chorizo. I wish they did papas with the meal because that is the way I have eaten this breakfast plate for 30+ years. From Fresno to San Diego and now Buckeye/ Verrado Arizona. 
    This is a hole in the wall. It is in an industrial part of town and very easy to get to. Restaurant was almost full and we were the only gringos in there. Very nice family has run this for about 20 years according to Angel. And I took a picture of his grandmother back in the kitchen. I think she thought I was loco. 
     Their homemade green salsa is absolutely off the hook. The red salsa is very good but you really get the feel of the Sonoran style in the green salsa. Guys coming in during lunch looked like very hard working people. We like going to places like this.
Oops almost forgot the homemade corn tortillas. YUMMY."}
{"text":"I think this place had ok food. The. Service was horrible the little boy that was not even old enough to work was rude is hell. Then it look like the grandma buddy and afterwords because the Menudo was not very good. I would not return"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! Worst service you can find the food is not great either had a gordita de birria and a taco it wasn't as horrible as the service but wasn't good either the only thing that was good here was the salsa. ...there was only 1 waitress she was doing the best she could was a pretty packed place and there  was a guy at the front who was I think the cashier not sure since he seemed to be doing nothing! He was probably the owners son or something in that nature otherwise I don't see why they would have him up there. .he wouldn't move a finger to help out the waitress and when asked for stuff it took him forever I saw a lady ask him for a togo cup it took him literally 15 minutes to get that not because he was busy he would just wonder off talking to customers or doing some other nonsense. .he would talk to customers in the most obnoxious way he that he was being funny but it really wasn't. .my family and I will NOT be returning here! I do not recommend this place at all would give 0 starts if it would let me"}
