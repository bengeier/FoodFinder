{"text":"I LOOOVE Moxies, I always go to the one down Barlow Trail. When I went to this one, I first noticed my wine glass had LIP PRINTS on it, so I pointed it out and they brought out another one. I then ordered some entrees and when the plates came along with it they had food on them. So the went back...
 Well at this point in time, I was pretty disgusted and didn't really feel like eating, but the manager said that I should stay... I agreed and was about to order when the people beside my table started freaking out because there was some floating in the just brought to the table glass of soda.
 At that point in time I left and went to the other, much cleaner, Moxies at the other end of the city."}
{"text":"Moxie's is moxie's but I went for dinner and had a starter salad. 
 The spring mix with salad.  All night I just kept raving about this $4-5 Salad.  It had your greens, feta, vinagrette dressing and tons of cranberries. OMG sooooooooooo good.  Check out the pic..  

I also had the Veal burger with pancetta ...  I don't remember the name LOL 


But the starter was yummy hahahhahaha"}
{"text":"This is a really great location and they have a great variety of food to choose from. I really like the apple curry bowl and the appetizer platter for a group is super yummy. The best is the Sunday brunch crab Benedict! I love it. It can get busy so my only issue is how long it takes to get your order sometimes."}
{"text":"It was a Tuesday night and our entire family came down with an awful cold.  My husband, and 3 sons were a mobile group of snot machines and didn't want to stay home to cook dinner in our germ infested house.  Since we had a couple of shops that we needed to visit, we decided to eat at the Moxie's in Chinook Centre.  As soon as we were sat at our table, the hostess took our drink order as our server had a very busy section and was running behind.  After our drink order was taken, our server, Dave, quickly showed up to check to see if our drink orders were taken, and also wanted to take the moment to introduce himself to us.  I was impressed that he took a moment to ensure that we had been taken care of in between tables and that he also took the time to introduce himself.  We ordered the mosaic dip to start, I had ordered the seafood linguine and my husby ordered the chicken penne alfredo.  All three of the boys ordered from the kids menu this time.  One ordered the kids pasta, the other ordered the junior burger with fries, and the youngest boy ordered the kids penne alfredo with a side of grilled chicken breast and veggies.  Okay, so I ordered for the younger one but I thought he needed to expand his horizons a little and explore a world outside of chicken fingers.

Our server took his time and was very patient in taking our orders.  He also gave us the option of bringing out the kids' meals out first or to wait until after the appetizer and bring out their meals along with the grownups.  I rarely get asked this question so I was a little shocked at first.  The boys were pretty entertained drawing pictures so I decided to have their meals served at the same time as the grownups.

The mosaic dip was heavenly and creamy!  I felt guilty with each bite and felt my hips grow slightly wider.  It was a huge hit with the boys and they quickly ran out of naan bread and was left with a whole bunch of dip.  There were shavings of green onion that got mashed in the dip and my 4 year old still enjoyed it!  YAY!  Our server came by to check on us and asked us if we would like more naan bread to go with our dip.  Again, I never get asked this question and I agreed.  One of the boys snuck in a few forkfuls of the dip while he waited.  He said the dip was too good to just sit there all alone.  Well, I guess I couldn't blame him.  It really was that good.  

Usually in between courses, the boys would inhale their drinks and would have to wait a while before they got a refill, but again, Dave was on top of that and made sure that our drinks were refreshed and definitely bottomless!  It was very difficult to believe that this man can be so cheerful and just on top of everything while serving such a busy section!

Our meals were served shortly after and the servers made sure that they brought out the boys' meals out first.  The boys liked the presentation of their plates.  They described their plates to look like the grownups plates - but smaller.  The two older boys inhaled their food and were still hungry.  I guess that might be a normal thing.  The oldest is 10 followed by the 9 year old.  I'm glad that we started with appetizers as they might have been starving even after their meals.  (Perhaps keep that in mind when dining with your own kids.  If they have a huge appetite like my own, you might want to start with appetizers or let them order off the \"grownup\" menu.)  My youngest son really liked the broccoli and chicken breast.  The creamy penne was a bit too new for him and he ate about half of that.  He said he thought it was a fancy mac and cheese and the white sauce tasted nothing like cheese.

My seafood linguine was wonderful!  The scallops were not chewy and were nice and soft like butter.  Every biteful was delightfully great as no two bites were alike.  You sometimes get a mix of mussel and pasta sometimes just dripping with their wonderful lobster rose sauce.  They also had shrimp tossed in and it was all good.  Like I said, the seafood was cooked well, and not rubbery.  I ended up over stuffing myself because I used the garlic bread to sob up every bit of their sauce.

The chicken penne alfredo cabonara was wonderfully packed full of flavor without it being salty.  The creamy alfredo didn't even taste like it came from a cheap package either which is why I usually avoid ordering cream pasta sauces from regular restaurants.  But his meal was surprisingly satisfying.  He kept complaining that he wouldn't be able to finish his meal because he felt too sick - yet he finished the entire thing.  I couldn't blame him either.

I find that sometimes with chain restaurants you get a hit and miss with food and a lot of times with service as well.  I've also found that this generation has really lost touched with service.  Its been very rare that you get good service AND good food.  We were very lucky that our food was very good, very flavorful, and the service left us feeling very pampered."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a Moxies.  Try the steak salad, its a good mix of Alberta's best and healthy greens."}
{"text":"I love Moxies slogan: Discover Your Many Moods.  I find this slogan to ring very true about the restaurant.  They offer so many different menu options to choose from; something to suit every mood you might have.

I used to love going to Moxies as a kid because I loved ordering the ice for desert.  It's served with dry ice so it comes out looking like it's steaming.  This is very cool to a youngster.  As I got older I realized Moxies was a great place to have dinner and drinks.  I also really enjoy it as a date place... especially the Chinook location.

I love the interior of the place.  It's so intimate and alluring.  It definitely has the perfect ambiance to sit close to someone and share a meal, drinks and stories.  They have a wide selection of beverages to choose from, and they are always very yummy.  I enjoy the Bellini's and martini's because they are just so darn delicious.

My favourite thing to do at Moxies is to order a few appetizers and share them between two people.  This way you get to try a few different things.  Plus, it's kind of fun to feed your date and a lot of the appetizers are finger food.  Very sensual.

I really do enjoy Moxies for a lovely date night, but it's also a great family restaurant or somewhere to hang out and catch up with the girls... or guys!"}
