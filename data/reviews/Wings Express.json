{"text":"I love Wings Express. I have been going to the location on Lindsay since 2004... I order my wings like this - 1 dozen, honey hot, ALL wings, extra crispy and an extra side of honey hot sauce... I DIE. best wings hands down. All the other \"wings\" joints in the valley ain't got nothin' on Wings Express! (super friendly staff too!)"}
{"text":"I go here when Buffalo Wild wings is packed full of sports folk. Their wings are good and decently priced. The building is very small and hard to spot from the road. If you are a food snob then this probably isnt the place for you. 

Every time my husband and I have been here the staff was very friendly. 

Beware of the restrooms!"}
{"text":"My Dad used to make fun of me whenever I would bring these wings home. Having been raised on a chicken farm he would go on and on about how those wings must have come from sick chickens because they weren't very meaty compared to say... wings from Native New Yorker. 

He's not entirely wrong. They aren't extremely meaty wings, but they are relatively cheap. You can walk out the door with their special, it's 6 dozen wings for roughly $25 or roughly .35 cents a wing. 

But price isn't why people go there. It surely also isn't the facilities since they are truly abysmal and more than a tad bit scary unless it's high noon and you go with a friend. 

The reason people eat these wings is because the sauce must have been created on Mount Olympus to give the Gods their hot wing fix. I swear it's so good you almost want to lick the container once all of the wings are gone. I've actually saved the sauce for use later to put on other food I cook at home! It's just that good!

I can only vouch for the Medium sauce though, as I don't get into the Hot or Suicide flavors. I like being able to taste things for the 24 hours after I eat my wings... 

Highly recommended if you don't mind packing heat to get in and out of the place. Or maybe a Taser."}
{"text":"This place is a mesa classic. Great inexpensive wings, and the flavors are on point. These guys invented the original honey hot. I also have been able to eat throughout the years their fried mushrooms and zucchini, taste as if I made it at home, amazing!!! I just tried their bacon burger, which prompted me to write this, and let me say it was quite quite tasty. A great deal for only $3.50!!!"}
{"text":"Actually a pretty good wing place. Good prices, okay food. Worth it out you're hungry for wings. Kind of a nostalgic feel.  It's about wings- not football, atmosphere, and waitresses. 

They don't build the price of debit usage into the price of the food. You pay $.50. I don't know why I find that so irritating. I can appreciate the whole keep money local thing and promote cash purchases- but I don't think this charge is because of any ideological pursuit."}
{"text":"On Friday Feb. 20 I ordered just plain wings for my 8 year old daughter and few hours later she was vomiting. She was very ill and vomiting for two days and we missed the wedding we came to AZ to attend."}
{"text":"Not the best wings, but will do. Nice prompt service!! They add an extra .50 for swiping a debit card tho, and the wings are pretty tiny. But nice quick meal if you're not in the mood to cook!! Also had the seasoned fries and fried zucchini... No complaints food was great!!"}
{"text":"I found a hair ball in my half bucket of hot wings. Not only is this disgusting and I lost my appetite, but the owner was plain rude. You don't yell at your customers in person or on the phone (even when your busy). It was my sisters idea to go here and the last time either of us will step foot in that place. This place lacks professionalism, customer service, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"The people at the establishment said that since we had our own drinks aka a slurpee from 7-11. We couldn't eat inside and sit down. I am never coming here again. If that's how you treat customers then wow i don't know how they are still in business"}
{"text":"Drive about 30 mins to come here once a month or so. Love their honey hot wings. Yeah, the wings are pretty small but the sauce is the best. Better than natives honey hot sauce. The reason my girlfriend and I keep going back is for their cheese sticks. They're probably just frozen out of a bag but oh are they crispy and delish. Best cheese sticks in town. I'm not from the area so it is a little \"ghetto\" but we usually come here for lunch and it's never bad. Plus the guy working the front with glasses is nice and memorizes our order now. Will continue to support this little goodie shop, the only problem is the price of gas to get there."}
{"text":"First of all the grub (burgers, zucchini, fries, sandwiches) is very good...the wings are slightly small but delicious!  It's one of the few places that have reasonably priced wings.  The inside is always clean and like others have mentioned...wings bought in mass are at a killer price.  The staff is friendly and as far as the clientele, harmless normal people...this coming from a Scottsdale native.  THE downside...maybe it's me, but I expect 12 wings whenever I order a dozen...not 11 or 10.  Yet, in the past year or so, that's what we continually receive via the drive-thru.  :("}
{"text":"Delicious wings (especially the honey hot). They serve them with carrots instead of celery which honestly I think is a better compliment. While here I also had the potato wedges (YUM), they were so cheesy, and tender and one order is huge! The place could use some brightening up, but other than that I'll be back ;)"}
{"text":"What a god-awful place probably some the rudest shortest service I've had in a long time didn't really understand the menu really because this one order is 10 - 12 a bucket is 6 orders I asked do you weigh them and he started yelling at me about they've been in business 20 something years and this is how they make money and they know what they're doing I think the wings are just ok sauce taste good but the pre cook them which is not very good to me definitely will go back here yes they're on the cheaper side but room service and just okay food is not OK for me I rather pay more somewhere else"}
{"text":"Awesome wings this place can't get any better. I order a dozen of hot wings and a dozen of honey hot which is my wife favorite. I have been here million of times and it has never turned me down."}
{"text":"Such good wings! Usually pretty meaty too. I've gone there a couple times and the wings were so small..but 90% of the time they are very big and meaty..YUM! And having gone to both locations more times than I can count...I've always had great service at both!"}
{"text":"Best wings you will find in Mesa! The wings are always so fresh and so hot! The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5  is because they need to work on their customer service. The girls who used to work the drivethru were rude at times, but this new girl they have is great, she remembers my order every time I pull up to the drive thru ha ha, goes to show how often I am there! Also, if you are short on time, I recommend that you call ahead. The drivethru process can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes, not good when you want something quick! Overall, you should definitely visit!"}
{"text":"This is a to-go wing place with a DRIVE THRU.  Yeah, man, you can just, like, drive through and get a dozen wings.  The added bonus to this not-having-to-get-out-of-your-car trend is that the wings are actually not bad.  They're not restaurant style phenomenal, but they're descent for the price.  I prefer the honey hot since the extra hot are more like mild to me, so I go for flavor.  They're tiny little wings, like half the size of an Oregano's wing, but the sauce is essentially tasty and again, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR. 

I've never eaten there, and I probably never will. The place is uncomfortable and muggy, always turned to the Spanish channel or Fox news on the little TV's.  What I noticed about this place is that calling in an order ahead of time doesn't matter, they still don't cook it until you get there.  Which is fine, but sort of odd.  In fact, I feel as though I've waited LONGER when I call in an order rather than just gone to the drive through. 

The fries are not bad, but you have to salt them yourself because I don't think they salt them.  Also fine, but sort of odd.

The service is usually prompt and helpful though the employee appears to be a 13 year old boy.  Fine, yet odd. 

This is not a bad place for some cheap, tasty to-go wings and also, man, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR.  In honor of this, sometimes my comrad and I just sit in the car and eat our wings to see how disgusting and white trashy we can get."}
{"text":"I have been going here for sometime and the wings are usually pretty good but the customer service is nonexistent. They did not do my order correctly on multiple occasions and refuse to correct these issues. The management is very rude. Even the employees have advised me that it doesn't matter what you complain about, the management is not the type to care or resolve it. The bathrooms are very dirty and smell horrible. The wings are very small and the price is not the best do yourself a favor eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Awesome fast service. Tastes amazing and great price. Convenient location although hard to find. Super freaky fast."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for a while, but I just happened to be driving down Alma School and absolutely had to stop.

Anyhow, Doug W.'s review is right on. The place is scary looking and the wings aren't all that meaty, but the sauce on these wings are wowowowow good. It could contain all the trans-fats in the world for all I know and I still wouldn't care. 

This is still a strictly to-go place in my book."}
{"text":"The wings here are really good. They price by the pound, not by the piece so the menu board says 10-12 pieces per order. I got the mild and the honey hot. Both were good but the honey hot is the way to go. The ranch is good too and it comes with carrot sticks. I also got the zucchini, decent but I have had way better; I won't order again. The drinks come in styro cups - that's a big plus for me. Also, they have a drive-thru window. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing wings. The honey hot were the best I've ever had. They have a simple menu and having a drive thru option which means I'll definitely be visiting again soon. Don't let the area or the appearance fool you!"}
{"text":"Devon works here so I have to give it 5 stars. He special made me a burger with a fork through the middle of it (I was just giving him a hard time). I tried the wings once and they were good as long as you like spicy! My grandparents go there all the time and they love it."}
{"text":"Definitely a guilty pleasure i just love these wings...they are well cooked and the sauce is delicious. I also like that the wings arent too big.  And the chicken they use is good never any bad after taste etc...."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was in high school ! This is our  go to spot for wings , as they're my boyfriends favorite and it's right down the street from our house ! Wings are always great and the burgers are good , too! Reasonable prices too"}
{"text":"Visited from CA to pick up my RV. Wanted good wings to watch Broncos Packers game. Had hot wings with ranch and they were great. I love wings that come out with crispy skin. Great sauce and ranch!"}
{"text":"Best wings in phoenix and they are reasonably priced. I would not recommend any of their other food but the wings and their ranch is top notch."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings! My fav is the honey hot. I've been going here for years. A year and a half ago, I moved to California and whenever I come back to Arizona I have to stop by for my wings. Today, I go thru the drive thru and order 2 orders of the honey hot, headed back to the freeway because we're heading home and realize that we only got one order. We had to turn around, go back to complain and the girl that took our order tells us that she only charged us for one, then if the fact that they charge a \"convince\" fee for using a card isn't bad enough, they want to charge us it again when they inconvenienced me. I mean, come on... Take an accurate order. Do your job! Plus she went and got the owner and he was a jerk. Talking over us and arguing with us. They have lost my business. Making a mistake on an order is forgivable but having poor customer service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went in to order a bucket of wings half hot and half honey hot. When i got home they gave me the wrong ones. When i called they wanted me to go back again that same night to get an exchange. (They just wanted to exchange without a discount) I couldnt go that same night so they told me they couldnt do anything about it. Poor service and they were not even busy. Wont go back to that place again and i will sure let everyone i know to stay away from that place."}
{"text":"Love this place amazingly good wings and great mozzarella sticks too. Only con is they charge to use your debit card. Like really guys who carries cash nowadays? Get with the times. That's the reason for 3 stars would have been 5 but you charge to use plastic."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going here. Wings barely had any flavor, were small, dry and tasted old. Plus the service was awful. Save your money and go to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great Wings - Best in Mesa!! This place is great when you need some greasy bar style food.  It is all so good.  They have the best ranch I have ever tried. I recommend the honey hot and extra hot wings, the mozz sticks are pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"The wings are good, but their customer service is terrible. I got there at 8:25 and one of the female employees told me the store was closed. And so we parked trying to think of where else to go, and I see 3 cars pull into the drive thru and after a short conversation, suddenly they are open again. Their page says they're open until 9. So I am really upset at this. They should change their hours online if they are really closed earlier than 9 or at least close the doors when they say they're closed."}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley!! Both their hot and honey hot are amazing! Good ranch as well makes for great wings! Great prices!"}
{"text":"THE BEST WINGS YOU WILL EVER EAT! EVER!  

They are so incredibly good they melt in your mouth.  These owners are LITERALLY the inventors of the Honey Hot flavor that people are now enjoying all across the nation...  They're the original creators of Long Wong's, which since they left, they're not the same.. 

Wings Express is bomb.  Their wings are smaller, cause they invest more in their flavor than their size, which I couldn't care less about.. Their wings are just so good.
I love food, love it... And this place is rad.

The only downside is their location.  With all the scary people in that area, it kinda makes me not wanna go there as much..."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for 4 years. It is soo good! I am extremely picky about my hotwings, and this place hits the nail on its head. Crispy, yet juicey; spicy, yet savory! And a dozen wings fries and a large drink for about 7 dollars! I will make the drive for this place anyday:) They have really good hot dogs as well! It may look like a whole in the wall restaurant, but they got their recipes straight"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! Ordered 40
Wings and some fried zucchini to go, my family couldn't get enough ! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"After reading several reviews and feedback from my husbands co-workers, I was eager to give this place a try. I am sad report this is without a doubt the most horrific wing joint I have frequented in some time. My entire family are avid wing eaters and to think we drove from Chandler to Mesa anticipating award winning wings it angers me!!!!! I have had better wings from the frozen food section at the local grocery store.  If you are serious wing eaters, I suggest you stay clear of this place! The wings, burgers, and frozen battered mushrooms were all below average, I wouldn't feed them to my dogs!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just tried to order over the phone. I was instructed to just come into the store to place a to-go order as they were too busy to take phone orders."}
{"text":"My go to place for take out wings.  Nice size portion, reasonable prices and best of all they have breaded mushrooms!  I like to toss them in the oven for about 15 minutes to get the optimum crispiness, but I do that with any ones wings.  Just a personal preference.  Never had a problem with screwed up orders or rude management, in fact I've never seen anyone there but the cook and the counter person."}
{"text":"Dont let the outside of this place scare you away. This joint has some of the best no frills wings on the east side of Phoenix and you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for honey hot wings! They definitely have ANY place beat when it comes to their wings. Couple of things you'll notice tho: 
1. they charge extra for using debit or credit...strike! with all the business this place does, they should be able to absorb any extra charges for using their debit/credit machine and still come out ahead.
2. if you look at the menu board, it says an order of wings is 10-12 wings (??)
I don't know of any place that gives you an approximate amount of wings lol...most places in fact charge by the piece.
But mind you, the wings are delicious! I'm not sure about rest of the menu, so you will have to try those out for yourself."}
{"text":"Gross...cockroaches crawling around floor!!  This place is nasty and the wings were dry, as though they had been sitting out for a couple hours!  Will never go back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite wing place. I started coming here when I worked in the area. It's so good, I continue to make the trek over here. The honey hot sauce is fantastic. The wings are crispy -- not soggy like so many other wing places. I haven't tried anything else on the menu and I really don't see a need."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area (though not really to Mesa), and so far, I'm not too big a fan of the Alma School/Southern part of town. I ended up going to this place because my friend blackmailed me into driving to get wings for him. I'm glad to report that, in spite of everything, these guys know what they're doing, and for being such a small business in a rougher part of town, they're doing the hot wing god's work.

I walk in the door and got a bit concerned because there wasn't anyone to help me at the counter. However, it looked like they were super busy, so I just chilled and watched the basketball game on their nice TV. It was relatively well-air conditioned, and such. I got helped within like, two minutes. She was nice. If you all are into hot wings, it seems like a decent family location, but when I was there around seven, it was one family and two guys just munching down and watching said game. It's a little chode-y, but the atmosphere beats Buffalo Wild Wings HANDS DOWN (goodness, I hate that place).

I ordered two \"orders\" of the hot wings and an XL drink, and it came out to around $15. Not bad at all, right? Which led me to be pretty skeptical about the wing quality. On my way back into my place, I got compliments from the neighbours about how good the wings smelled. They truly did smell amazing. 

I usually keep vegetarian, and I even had to try one. I have to admit, they're really good. They could have been hotter, however; we'll be ordering the X-Hot next time we go.

I did have to wait like, ten minutes or so to get my wings, but I'll attribute that to the fact that they have a drive-thru. If you're in a rush, perhaps that's the way to go."}
{"text":"When compared to Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop the only up those places have on this joint is the atmosphere. This place is perfect for to-go orders and they even have a drive thru. You get 12 wings for around $5.50. They offer a special too of about 75 wings for $27 if you need to fill a boatload of peeps.  they also have hamburgers, hotdogs, fries, fried zucchini and salads. They have about 5 ,levels of hot, a honey hot(which is finger licking good) and a honey bbq.  i thought it was odd that their wings only came with carrots no celery...never have I gotten wings without celery. Besides that wings were very good and the sauce makes them addicting."}
{"text":"Not exactly how I remembered this place. I have been a customer since their prior location on Lindsay and Broadway. Their wings were crispy and so full of flavor. Stopped in last week and ordered the half bucket in medium sauce to go. The wings were just funky and the meat was kind of bloody. Almost all the wings were bloody. There has got to he a better way to pack the wings to not have all the sauce spill and leak everywhere. I will come back and try them again and update my review as needed."}
{"text":"Don't try to order pick up, they will put you on hold and forget about the phone. This place is run by youngsters that don't know how to manage a \"rush.\" Won't be going back"}
