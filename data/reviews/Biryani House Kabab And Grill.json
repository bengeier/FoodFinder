{"text":"I ordered a lot of food for me and my friends for takeout. The order was confirmed by their online website. But when my friends went over to pick the food up they said that the food wasn't prepared and the chef has already left. That was very unprofessional. I have tried their food at couple occasions and it's mediocre to average at its best. The ambience and the service of the restaurant is sub par."}
{"text":"The decor is so so but the food is delicious. One of those hole in wall places w authentic Pakistani food. I had naan with sesame seeds, chicken tikka, chicken Karahi and kebabs. All were delicious. I have tried many Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh and the food is here is in my top 3. Portion sizes are average. Highly recommend the naan and kebabs. The owner is so nice."}
{"text":"Finally a good Pakistani restaurant in Monroeville. Food is excellent. Their sesame bread ( Till walay naan). Is really good."}
{"text":"We went for a dine in on a Sunday evening. Ordered   Chicken Sheek Kebab, Goat Biriyani, Butter Naan, Panneer Tikka Masala. Biriyani was very tasty and the meat was really tender. Kebab was real good. The naan was well done and really light on tummy. We finally tried the Gulab Jamun which was very soft and yummy. Overall a good dine in experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Pakistani food you can get in Pittsburgh. Kabobs are amazing and naan is fresh. Vegetable curries are delicious as well. I strongly recommend this place to everyone as I am a loyal returning customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with minimal expectations; but I must say, we were pleasantly surprised! The food was beyond amazing. We are so happy there's finally a halal Pakistani restaurant here in Pittsburgh. We will be going back very often! Must try!"}
