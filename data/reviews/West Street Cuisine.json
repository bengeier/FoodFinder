{"text":"I like this place and buy from them often. They owned a physical store before at sheppard and brimerly. The food is traditional Guangzhou style and the staff were nice."}
{"text":"Had their jajang noodles. Spicy pork sauce noodles? Something like that. Small portion for $6. Pork was more fat than pork. Sauce had lima beans in it, which was unusual. Noodle texture was good. Soup on the side was basically salt water. Ate the whole plate of noodles. The whole time, I was trying to figure out what it was supposed to taste like vs what it actually tasted like. I know there's a lot of variations on this kind of noodle. I was expecting more the type I find at Congee Queen. There was a hint of that taste in this plate, but not that much. The whole thing, to me, tasted a tad off. I'm not sure whether that was intentional or not. Regardless, I won't be ordering that dish again. I was sick after. I can't guarantee this plate of noodles is what made me sick, but it's the only thing I ate that was different than the rest of my family who didn't get sick."}

{"text":"3.5 stars. Food court style Chinese street cuisine. I've noticed a lot of these have been opening in the last few years and I i think this one is probably one of my go to for just a quick bite. The food is good and all as well as the prices but the building it is in makes me hesitate whether I want to go or not. Only because some of the other vendors and management of the building is crap. Very rude and disrespectful. I would always do take out. rather eat in the car then sit in the eating area. 

The food itself is average foodcourt food but definitely one of the better ones out there. The variety they have is less then other vendors but quality is better then quantity. The seasoning is quite hard to grasp as I've tried to imitate the taste at home because there's just this really authentic Guangzhou taste to it. Maybe it's psychological... I don't know."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   This is a Canton/Guangzhou style congee than the HK styled ones (read: My Kitchen, Sam's Congee).   I like the congee here as the mixins as they are cooked immediately with the order.  The rice rolls have a nice smooth texture with a good bite  (not soggy).  I have yet to try their noodle offerings but they look nice from people watching."}
{"text":"This review would not have been possible without my Yelp friend picking up takeout for me from West Street Cuisine. So this review is based solely on food.

I now have grow to enjoy Guangzhou Style steamed rice roll. A little more chewy texture and more intense \"rice\" taste as most shops here prepared their paste from scratch.

West Street Cuisine is good value for the price and I really enjoyed their plain rice roll. For the meat rice roll, I found the filling is sub par.

Hopefully, some one nice would pick up some take out for me again!"}
