{"text":"I love Pepper's. Pretty simple review here. Good food and a lot of it. And IMHO, it beats the highly rated, relatively nearby \"Rap's\", hands down. If anything, I wish they served Roti style dishes... I love the wraps.

 And... the girl behind the counter is really pretty. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious food!!! I went for the first time based on a recommendation from a Jamaican colleague. WELL...let me tell you!!! I have driven past this little gem for over two years as I was always \"on the way\" somewhere!!! The food is fabulous! I picked up jerk chicken with rice and beans and it was fabulous! The only problem I can see here is that it's WAAAAAY too close to my work!!! Clean, efficient and friendly staff & owner! I can't wait to go back!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation and I was pleasantly pleased. I had the fried chicken with rice & peas. I have to say the show stopper was the 'manish water' (Goat Soup). This is a specialty soup which most have not mastered but, Peppers certainly has. Nice spot to grab some authentic Jamaican food."}
{"text":"Peppers came on a strong recommendation and it did not disappoint. Their jerk is tender, moist and satisfying. A little less spicy than other jerk places, their seasoning is a little lighter but has the perfect amount of kick, a great smoky char and crisp skin. The rice and peas really hits the spot too, definitely a notable mention."}
