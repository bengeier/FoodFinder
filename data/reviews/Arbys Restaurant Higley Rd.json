{"text":"Great food and manager! Wish I had this gentleman's name.. Ate lunch here today Thursday around 11:20am.. The place was busy and he handled it like a pro. He was cashier, helping out with food and cleaning tables! The food was out fast and it the best quality! (We special ordered the meat extra thin and it actually was)! We will defiantly be back thanks again!!"}
{"text":"I rated this a 1 star because the guy that served us was coughing which indicates the person is sick, or something else that he did. Anyways, I got sick with a flu-like symtomps after eating the food  Disclaimer: There are other possibilities on why I am sick, but this is probably the reason why I got sick"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I love Arby's.  However, the lack of customer service and numerous errors make this location one to avoid.  In the past I have used the drive through at this location on multiple occasions and have never had a good experience.  One time when I was there I witnessed two employees blatantly flirting and ignoring me trying to hand them my card.  Tonight I got to watch as an employee named Isabel messed up our order in numerous ways.  I ordered two drinks with my food, one regular and one diet.  When she was filling the diet drink the cup leaned over onto the Mt dew side and started filling up with mt dew.  She saw this and quickly out the drink back to the diet dispenser.  She did not empty the drink or start over.  When she went to hand me the drinks I asked her if she could redo the diet drink.  She said there was no reason because none of the Mt dew made it into the glass.  I personally saw the Mt dew make it in the drink and I know she did as well.  She handed me the drinks and I conceded.  Thinking, wow this is the most bizarre interaction I've had with someone over a drink.    Fast forward with me now.  I'm back home and eating with my family.  I had spaced it at the time but I remembered once I was home that I ordered and paid for an apple crisp for my wife.  I went to go get it and give it to her and what do you know....it's not there.  So Isabel not only screwed up on a grossly overpriced fountain drink, she screwed up bagging the order."}
{"text":"Excellent roast beef, the Big max is the best. I asked for extra horsey sauce didn't get but 3. Then I realized the roast beef is delicious doesn't need none of of that. Fast drive thru even during high traffic times at noon"}
{"text":"Haven't been in maybe 20 years was a pleasant change the chicken garden salad was enjoyable my Grandkids loved the chicken sandwiches and curly fries  this restaurant was clean and courteous but very busy at lunch time"}
{"text":"I love Arby's even though it's pretty hit or miss. Today, I took a bite of one of the 4 sandwiches we got, and almost threw up. The meat tasted rancid. I opened all of the sandwiches, and you could tell the meat was nasty just by looking at it. I've never done a yelp review, but I was so disgusted today that I felt I had to."}
{"text":"I arrived early Saturday morning and was the first customer of the day. It was a really clean restaurant. I got the patty melt and French dip sandwich and some curly fries. The beef was done just right and the French dip sauce was flavourful and not too salty. The curly fries were crispy and tasty and not too greasy. It was an enjoyable fast food experience!"}
{"text":"Good roast beef. The place can get crowded, but service is pretty fast when they're not."}
