{"text":"Eighteen has a creative menu, super nice people, extremely comfortable atmosphere and we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch! Two of us shared delicious vegetarian sushi and authentic classic shakshuka. We will definitely come back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Kosher restaurants usually have to be graded on a curve, especially in this case because you only have two options in Pittsburgh. Staff are friendly and accommodating, including of little children. Their hours are apparently unreliable -- sometimes they are just not open -- but we were in luck and our dinner reservation worked out. The restaurant is classy looking, and food is presented in an attractive and stylish fashion.

The big hit here seems to be the sushi; my spicy salmon was quite good. There are a lot of specialty rolls that are really expensive, but again, where is a kosher eater going to get sushi otherwise? The shakshuka was heavy on a traditional spice that my mom didn't care for by my wife did, so that seems to be a recommend. The cod cakes were almost all bread filler, with fish flavoring. The soup of the day, a New England fish chowder, was not creamy, so the title seemed a misnomer. The Caesar dressing for salad was not to my tastes, but it is homemade. It may seem strange to me for lacking a key ingredient - Worcester sauce - which my wife suspects doesn't come kosher. My daughter devoured the special cheese ravioli; they were more like pierogis, but clearly very tasty.

We will definitely hit this restaurant with my orthodox family again, and I will focus on sushi next time. That may lead to a higher-starred review when I do."}
{"text":"Kosher in the house!!! 
whoooo hooo
ok with that being typed
you will have three types of customers here in the great city of Pittsburgh
one will be those that keep them selves strictly kosher and if that is the case you are going to LOVE eighteen (its eclectic dairy and sushi)
two you will be in the need of a kosher (insert here parent child friend) and they need to eat kosher. 
Three would be the person that just does not know but no worries if you chose to eat here you will be pleasantly surprised at how tasty good kosher is so don't be scared go try. 
located on Murray ave parking can sometimes be a challenge its all metered
inside its very calming white table clothes & a candle on each table 
it reminds me of a row house as seating is in a long row except for a little section that has 4 tables 
I have visited a few times the last visit the place was really hopping on a Tuesday night (because they keep some different hours I would recommend calling before going) on a prior visit Sushi chef was out for Chinese New Year
Menu has lots of sushi offerings from rolls to full sashimi dinners to me that is what a love about this place. My caterpillar roll was very tasty. I love sushi.
they also have pastas such as Alfredo 
salmons as a meal 
and for lunch fare they have salads and sandwiches one I have tried the beet reuben its a very cool concept but you must like beets I love beets but they were so generous with the beets I took a few off.
One visit I asked for ice tea which they did not have fresh  BUT the waitress said no worries she made me a refreshing mint tea fresh from tea bags
we have had their Cesar salad its nice and fresh and simple
another thing to give a try is shakshuka its a spicy egg dish made with harissa 
ah the chocolate torte was very yum and my daughter said yup this is really nice.
service at eighteen has always been very friendly and with a smile
though at times it can be a bit slow....
prices if your not used to eating at a good kosher place might seem a bit high it goes with the territory."}
{"text":"When you don't follow any kind of dietary restrictions, and you're not religious, dining out with a kosher friend can be a generally not-so-satisfying challenge. I remember years ago someone taking me to the former 'King David' Chinese kosher restaurant that used to be in Squirrel Hill, and had THE single most boring and bland plate of Asian food EVER. I have actually had Chinese food that gave me actual food poisoning that tasted better. Since my house isn't kosher, and I can't take anything to a kosher family's house except kosher wine or garden herbs or fresh veggies from the garden, going out to eat at a kosher restaurant is about the ONLY option. And usually, for an omnivore, this is not a tasty occasion.

So my better half's mom, who does keep kosher, came to town and she wanted to go to dinner. She not only keeps kosher, but also has other dietary restrictions to keep arthritis in check. Making it even more of a challenge.

With not very much to choose from to cover all of those bases she suggested Eighteen, which I had never heard of. 

Located to the side of Pinsker's in Squirrel Hill, the space is actually very pleasant. Linens on the tables, candles, very comfortable lighting, and a tasteful decor. The staff, though hard to find at first, was incredibly friendly and attentive. 

We took our seats and perused the menu, which specializes in sushi, and found quite a creative smattering of dishes.

Because of the restrictions, mominlaw's order was specific, and they were very happy to help her. She ordered a few of the sushi offerings her way, and I settled on the one dish that a non-kosher person would most safely like, the fettuccine Alfredo with portabella mushrooms. I almost chose the 'Reuben' they had on the menu, until I realized the trick my eyes had played on me. What I thought was roast 'beef' turned out to be 'beet'. Me and those purple roots just do not get along.

The sushi arrived, was very nicely presented, with a nice bowl of wasabi. She loved it, and it totally took care of her needs.

The Alfredo was very creamy, though not cheesy, with obviously fresh herbs, a decent portion of the mushrooms on top, and came in a very filling portion. It was really rather delicious.

Now, this is not going to be a regular haunt for me. I like my meat and cheese, and love them together. However, after trying different kosher offerings, whether home cooked, catered (I used to work at a private Jewish school), or in other restaurants like the late King Davids, I am very glad to see that there is one very pleasant little spot that doesn't do all-bland where I can go once in that blue moon when someone has such dietary restrictions and actually enjoy the meal.

The pricing is rather high, which is a little disappointing, but since it's only a once-in-that-blue-moon kind of thing, it's okay. And if you do keep kosher, Eighteen is a very nice option for dining out.

Again, I can't praise the staff enough for being sweet, kind and attentive, and even the big screen TV that they were feeding from YouTube threw me a few surprises. All of a sudden on came the Buena Vista Social Club. Wow. Good choices guys!"}
