{"text":"I shouldn't even write this review because I like when nobody is at this divey southside gem. Cheap drinks, weird locals and all the R.Kelly your heart could desire. Cash only. Smoker friendly. Odd back rooms and secret paths. And no rules. I can't even begin to express my love for Walker's."}
{"text":"The music done died....  I hung out here more than I would like to admit. It was a dive bar but always fun."}
{"text":"What is not to love! Cheap drinks and good times at a hole in the wall bar. The locals and regulars make you feel like family, and the bartenders are friendly and accommodating. My friend knows everyone there and it is always a party when I stop by. They'll play whatever music you want and there is never a shortage of friendly faces to talk to. Christmas party at the end of the year to thank the patrons was so much fun. Don't expect too much going in, and just let the yi times roll.  Only downside is the way your clothes smell when you go home because of the smokiness.  I heart Walker's."}
{"text":"Hey it is what it is: a simple Pittsburgh shot & a beer bar. Expect PBR, Coors Light, Bud & Yuengling. Friendly Friday happy hour crowd.   What I surprised me the most is that when I checked in here with this app, I got awarded the \"High Roller\" badge -- too funny!"}
{"text":"This place was just what I expected from a hole in the wall bar. I will have to give it 4 starts because it wasn't anything more or less than I expected. I will say that my friends had a birthday party in the back room and they were welcoming and went over the top to accommodate everyone and everything. I will say that sometimes larger bars will not do what Walker's did for the party. I really appreciated seeing this bar being so welcoming to people who were not their usual clientele.   We had some wings and beer. I mean, their beer was $2!!!! A draft for $2!!! I was ecstatic! That is a great price for a frosty mug and a cold brew! And their wings were great. Seriously...great. I think that our favorites were the parm and garlic wings. The wings were meaty, juicy, and saucy. Just how I like them. These weren't just little wing dings that you had to eat 12 just to feel like you ate 4. These were big and filling.   The only downfall, they allowed smoking in the bar. Ugh. I am not the smoking bar fan. I would probably not go back again anytime soon because of this. Would I meet my friend out, maybe. But this would not be a go to place because of the smoking. Other than that. This place was a gem."}
