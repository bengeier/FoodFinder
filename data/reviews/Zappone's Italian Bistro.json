{"text":"I can honestly say this is the best Italian food I have had.  Considering I grew up working for my Uncle Nunzie (born in Italy) at his restaurant and I lived 2 doors down from a little old lady from Sicily whose mission seemed to be to feed the entire neighborhood when she could, this is saying a lot.  From the spaghetti and meatballs to the porcetta ragout (my absolute favorite when it is on the menu), from the bread, appetizers and desserts to the sandwiches and bar selection everything is amazing.  The staff is pleasant and attentive, the owners walk the dining area to make sure everything is just right.  It is decorated well and has a terrific atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had lunch catered for our whole office, the food was fantastic! Service was great. I would highly recommend Zappone's and will definitely go back with the family. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! My husband & I came across this place when we were looking for a caterer for our wedding. We scheduled a tasting with Dina & everything was absolutely wonderful, so wonderful in fact that they did cater our big day this past Saturday. Dina and her team were phenomenal. They made the evening completely stress free for me. We got compliments on the food all night long!    Also, after our tasting we did become somewhat regulars. Spaghetti & meatball night is our favorite. $5.99 for spaghetti & meatballs, a dinner salad, and fresh bread!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Zappone's for years now. This is my favorite Italian Restaurant in Gilbert and Phoenix. Dina and Sal never disappoint.....Love several dishes but the Chianti Braised Beef is out of this world... I would also recommend the Antipasto meat and cheese board...salads are great...Zappone's is  also family friendly and a real value and affordable the pizza is a must....The best Italian in Arizona.....I grew up back east and thought we had great Italian food but this place is a jewel.  Manga Italiano... Ciao !"}
{"text":"Just don't understand the rave reviews??? The saying \"if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all\" comes to mind but  - I really don't get it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had them cater my wedding and they did a fantastic job. The food was delicious, the staff was punctual and very helpful. When we set up the appointment to do a tasting they were very accommodating and made us feel welcomed. The owner is very personable and made sure we were well taken care of. They answered any questions promptly and made sure every detail was covered. We had them do a buffet dinner and appetizers for the cocktail hour. The guests all talked about how great the bruschetta appetizers were and how creamy and good the Alfredo was. I would use them to cater another event and recommend them to anyone looking for good quality food."}
{"text":"Just returned from our first and last visit to Zappone's. \"Homemade\" ravioli? Sure doesn't taste like it. REAL homemade ravioli has a distinctly soft dough, not dough that is hard around the edges and REAL homemade ravioli is filled with fresh sweet ricotta. How do I know what REAL homemade ravioli tastes like? My grandmother made her heavenly ravioli from scratch every holiday and trust me, they were to die for! Sadly, Zappone's presentation doesn't even come close. Hubby's pizza was so-so (we've both had better) but their crust was decent and definitely homemade. The greeters and waitresses were friendly but we still had to ask for sugar for iced tea and the dressing was on the salad instead of on the side as I had asked. Way too many glitches and sadly UNhomemade food for us to pay a return visit."}
{"text":"This is an amazing family owned restaurant. I love to have lunch here at least once a month, great specials, great wine selection, and the staff is super friendly. Favorites are their bruschetta board, chicken caprese sandwich, and their penne ala vodka is a must. Also, Chef Sal has cooking class events that are really fun to attend. I personally haven't used them, but I have heard that their catering service is excellent."}
{"text":"OMG! What a find! Tina who works here recommended this place months ago but I forgot about it. We found a coupon in a mailer and decided to come here for our anniversary no less! And guess what? No regrets! We debated....Fancy restaurant in Scottsdale or play it low key? Glad we came here. First, we got here during happy hour 3-6 and got a Four Peaks 8th St draft for $3! Great price as we were just at Four Peaks and their price was slightly higher. My house red wine was only $4 and delicious. They come out with moist crusty bread accompanied with balsamic vinegar olive oil dip. I hear they bake their own bread. Yummy! We ordered salad, pizza with mushroom and Alfredo chicken rigatoni. The salad and pizza came out quickly. We were so excited about the pizza cause the crust was exactly how we like... Stiff and thin when you hold it up (no pun intended). The sauce was perfect and they did not go cheap on the mushrooms! My pasta was perfect! The sauce wasn't heavy nor salty as I previously had at other establishments. During our meal, we dropped our pizza and beer to the ground! We were so excited to find new hang out we accidentally knocked our food off the table trying to each for a slice! The chef and owner came over and immediately made a new pizza and our waiter got us a new pint. What service. I didn't have room for the cheesecake so I'm taking that home by the looks of it, I'll devour that before midnight. Overall, this is our new hang out. We left when entertainment started but we got to hear a sample. Italian singing?? Really?? Awesome for sure. Can you believe that? Free entertainment! On a Saturday evening. This place is located at a strip mall. No biggie. People here are friendly. Our waiter Andre was purely \"grand\". Best service in a long time. You'll love this place. I'm coming back with a huge party!!"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets for Italian dining. Cosy family atmosphere. Low noise level so conversation can be heard without having to yell. If you enjoy great Italian you need to give Zappones a try.   Happy hour from 3:00pm to 6:00pm with great choices in appetizers.  Wait staff great with pleasant personalities and appealing levels of friendliness.   Discovered this place about a year ago and have returned again and again because of the great dink b experience each time."}
{"text":"Loved the food! We've had the Alfredo,  penne with vodka sauce, spaghetti,  and pizza, loved them all! Very friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Food was good but not fantastic. Small restaurant but cozy. I do like the fact that they offer seasonal cooking classes! Definitely want to try that out."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome. Great atmosphere , fantastic food. Absolutely love this family owned restaurant"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience on Saturday night. We went around 6 pm and it was getting pretty busy but the server sat us right away.  They have a hostess but she wasn't the one to seat us. The server was very busy but still helpful.  I ordered the seafood linguine but I didn't want the sauces they offered so she quickly helped to come up with a butter garlic sauce and the kitchen did a fabulous job with it. I loved the breads that came with the meal as well as the side salad.  I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this quaint little bistro and was very grateful that I did.  Service was great and so was the food.  I am not much for Italian food, but whenever i do plan to eat some, this will be the place I go.  They really seem to care about quality, so works for me."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for the first time last night. We were very pleased withe the service and the menu options. I had the eggplant parmesan that came with a side of spaghetti and a salad.  The salad was good and the spaghetti was well prepared. The eggplant was flavorful but only barely warm. I thought the menu was priced adequately too. We plan on trying Zapones again."}
{"text":"We came here based on yelp reviews and can't wait to come back!  As we were told by our server Zappones is run by an Italian couple and they make everything authentic. The bread was heavenly!  The Caesar salad was good. I had the lasagna, which was fresh and had great flavor, so delicious.  Next time I will order with meat sauce as there is very little meat in lasagna traditionally. My husband had the shrimp scampi in rose sauce over fettuccine which was to die for!  He wanted to go back a couple of hours later and have it again.  Our server was sweet and friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight at Zappones and were totally impressed. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and decided to try out something new. I'm not the biggest fan of Italian food, but I must say that this was the best meal we have had at a restaurant in a long time. My wife had the fettuccine with truffle and mushroom, the fettuccine was fresh and the sauce while not overly creamy was a perfect compliment to the pasta. I had the Chianti braised beef over rigatoni. It was not my first choice but when asking the server for her recommendation she said it was the chefs specialty. She was definitely correct. The beef was fork tender, beautifully tasty, rich and simply fantastic. I will definitely be back to have it again. To finish off a great meal we both had desert. My wife had the mascarpone cheesecake, it was light and flavourful. I had the chocolate grand mariner cake with ice cream, orange caramel and foam. It was spectacular. The service was fantastic and very attentive, and not only our own waitress but all servers seemed to help each other out, never letting a glass stay empty, or a dirty plate stay on the table. We can't wait to go back on our next visit to Gilbert."}
{"text":"Dina and Sal Zappone have created a little gem in the East Valley! The best Italian food served with a smile and you can't forget the warm homemade bread! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"As a restaurant guy, working in the industry for 24 yrs I come to find a certain level of service or scrutiny.   That being said, this place surpassed all my expectations.  Everyone was working as a team, everyone was genuinely nice, everyone had a smile an were happy.  I told my wife, this is the kind of restaurant I would want if I ever opened one.  The food was great, the service was great, the live music was perfect for the space.  We will be back!  In my top 5 of all restaurants in my life.  Erin was an amazing server, Tony was top notch as a buser/helper."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a pasta craving...Zappone's is where I go.  The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable.  I always take my visitors here and everyone has been impressed."}
{"text":"Hey. Y'all. Great place. Jus saying. I work at two great places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. This is good! Homemade pastas. Calamari to die."}
{"text":"We stopped by because we had just checked into our hotel and wanted a quick lunch and it was nearby. We are in Phoenix often to visit our son but we almost always eat near Scottsdale.  This place is in an unlikely location  in a newly developing part of the East Valley.  What a find! We have traveled widely in Italy, where you can't get a bad meal. The food here is equally terrific. We had the mussels, the arugula salad with shaved fennel, the prosciutto flatbread, and a simple pasta dish. All wonderful. Perfect tomato sauce....just like in Rome and environs. A lovely young couple run the place. They have live music some nights. Last night they served the Feast of the Seven Fishes. Dang...we missed it!  But we are retuning tomorrow for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! The pizza was out of this world and the atmosphere was clean, calm and beautiful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit to this restaurant. What prompted our initial visit was a recommendation from a friend, who claimed that this was the best fettuccine alfredo she had ever tasted and that the pasta was made fresh. The alfredo is good but it's no different than the one I make at home from a recipe off of Pinterest and the pasta is definitely NOT fresh. I now question everything that my friend recommends lol. Anyway, our first visit was fine even though I wasn't impressed. Now our second visit, that was bad. First of all, our waiter was mediocre. The type to do the bare minimum -no refills, never checks in to see if you need anything and seems bothered to even be there. All of the other tables around us seemed to be getting great service from other staff so we were probably just unlucky.  I ordered the wild mushroom fettuccine. The sauce was so watery that it would not stick to the pasta thus rendering it flavorless. I added copious amounts of salt in an attempt to coax some flavor out of it. I'm not sure that we'll be back any time soon but I will say that I'd rather give a local restaurant my business rather than a place like Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing! The waitress was  kind enough to open the patio for us. We ate an Italian chopped salad and bruschetta trio. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Bonus there was no wait!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we actually went for the live music but we loved the food as well. The fried gnocchi were little pillows of lusciousness. They were followed rather quickly by a very fresh house salad that had green olives, roasted red peppers and mixed greens. We had veal and chicken piccata which was a perfect pairing of tangy lemon, capers and cream over an artfully placed base of rapini, cherry  tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The veal was the winner here as it worked best with the picatta flavors. The espresso was good and the deserts ample. The staff was very attentive. The only complaint was the pacing of our meal was a bit rushed. Nevertheless we will go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"So far I have had the fried ravioli, spaghetti & meatballs, and lasagne. They were all amazing, however the portion sizes were too small. I felt like I needed to order a second entree because I was still hungry. If they would increase portion sizes, this place would definitely be 5 stars"}
{"text":"This isn't just my favorite new Italian restaurant, it's my favorite new restaurant, period! I am a serious foodie, and it's difficult to make me happy (just ask my friends and family). Also the quantity of REALLY GOOD food I have eaten in this state is almost too small to measure. So where do I start with Zappone's? It's everything you ever wanted in a casual Italian place. The service is friendly, efficient and very accommodating. Like, can I order that, but leave that off or add that kind of thing. Again, with the ME being picky. The food is beautiful, freshly made in-house, and in terms of the flavor, ranks up there with any Italian I've eaten anywhere (S.F., LA, etc). At least one reviewer was totally incorrect - not only do they use the very freshest ingredients, they will only use certain special cheeses and sausage they import from Italy.  My faves so far? Well if I have to pick; Eggplant Rolatini, handmade Ravioli, Enzo Pizza, Pork Milanese, House Salad, Bolognese sauce....and I haven't made it all the way through the menu yet :) The daily fresh bread is baked right there by Chef Sal and is available for purchase to take home.  Since I'm also a wine lover, I appreciate that the wine is priced reasonably (seriously, there are places you can pay over $10 for a glass of Kendall-Jackson - ridiculous!), and that the wine list is growing to include more boutique wines and greater variety. I like it there so much I have had two events there for my wine group, and both were amazing with the food, service and wine.   And yea I know there's paint on the windows, but do you have any idea how many restaurants have gone out of business here??? I'm not a fan of the paint either, but I don't care as long as they stay in business and I can keep eating there!  If you went when they first opened, you need to go again!  (just so you know, I never write Yelp reviews....)"}
{"text":"Sal's pizza rocks! His authentic Italian food is amazing and it shows that he know what he is doing when it come to food!   Can't wait for their new bar/lounge area to open!!   Thanks Sal and Dina for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I admit it. I'm a fusspot. Often people will look at me strangely and go \"What kind of Italian are you?!\" The answer? One who when she finds golden food, will return time and time again. Still need more convincing? I find no problems in driving the 40 minutes or so distance from Scottsdale to Zappone's. Most(if not all) ingredients are I believe imported from Italy.  I have seen this labor of love grow since December, and from what I understand Sal and Dina have some great ideas to keep the décor and environment fresh and new. I believe there will be TVs soon and a longer area for a bar.   For appetizers, my ultimate favorite is the calamari. Chef  Sal's doing his a new way now, I believe adding lemon and more flavors, however he's still willing to do it his old way- just ask for it :)   Now the kicker. Now is where people truly think I'm weird. When I find a great meal, I don't like to switch things up and will stay with my tried and true, old reliable. The reason? Simple. What if I don't like the new meal? Then I wasted money on something I don't want, when I could have stayed with something good all along. My \"Tried and true\" at Zappone's is *drum roll* Their pizza! Cheesy, light crust, crunchy-but not burned, yet also not gooey and undercooked. Simply perfection.  Not big on wine, so I can't comment on selection or even taste, but there's a lot to pick from.  Staff is friendly, and it's great to see Dina working right along side them. I think that's refreshing to see. What she makes them do, she'd do herself. If you have any questions on the food, ingredients, or how it's prepared, ask for Dina or Alex."}
{"text":"Zappone's Italian Bistro in Gilbert provides excellent catering services for any budget.  We recently had them cater a family anniversary party for my sister and all our guests raved about the quality of the food.  I would highly recommend them for any celebration you may be planning.  Dina Zappone is knowledgable, professional, and gives 110% to ensure you and your guests are satisfied.  Thank you Dina, you are the best!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner for the first time at this local italian restaurant. The food was fresh, well prepared and tasty. Our appetizer of mussels in red marinara sauce was positively wonderful! Had chicken marsala and that was also great. Prices were pretty reasonable, too. Disappointed that we had no bread on our table as I have read reviews that it was fantastic. Will remember to ask for it next time as we intend to go here again."}
{"text":"I am an Italian food snob because my family is Italian and I grew up on authentic Italian foods.   Rarely have I come across a worthy Italian eatery in the Phoenix area.   Look no more, this one is going on my list of regulars.   The truffle mushroom pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! I had the chicken pesto sandwich with house salad it was to die for. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We learned about this restaurant from a recent review in the AZ Republic.    We just got back from an early dinner and it was authentically Italian!!!!     The bread was truly Italian, chewy crust and not sweet.    The food was very tasty and delicious.  The dessert sampler was amazing.   Great place, not expensive and the chef Sal and his wife Dina (the owners) are delightful and very welcoming.     Will definitely be going back soon.   A great find in the east valley!"}
{"text":"This place was an amazing find!! Nicely decorated and the customer service was over and above any expectation! And if that isn't enough to get you here then let me tell you about the delicious food. The owner bakes the bread from scratch as well as homemade pastas. I had penne a la vodka which was so delicious. Hubby had pasta with clams and mussels which he loved and probably will come back here just for that! We topped of the dinner with dessert. Heaven."}
{"text":"We selected Zappone's to cater our wedding. We had several different places set up to try but after meeting with Dina we knew we had found the right place and cancelled our other appointments. Dina made us feel welcome, served us AMAZING food and has been more than helpful with menu selections and ideas. She even went by our venue to get an idea of set up and flow for the evening. We have eaten there many times as well and each time the food has been outstanding. Overall, they have gone above and beyond with wonderful customer service and great food. 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"My husband is from Rhode Island and knows his Italian. He gives the red sauce a thumbs up! The place is really charming, the decor is like a Godfather scene. Pasta with meatballs was great, antipasti salad and bruschetta were yummy!"}
{"text":"Finally getting Zappone's and I must say it is delicious!  The arugula and prosciutto flatbread has to be the best thing I've eaten in ages!  I am very anxious to come back and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Zappone's Bistro today and all I have to say...it was an exquisite Italian culinary experience.  We ate family style and from the bruschetta to the dessert it was a delight.  The food was prepared fresh to order with a lot of \"love\" and the service was perfect as well.  I live in Scottsdale and this would give Andreoli's a run for their money!  Great job!  Wonderful food and experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout tonight from Zappone's. I have never eaten here prior, usually takeout is lacking the quality you usually get sitting in, not tonight.  Atmosphere was welcoming.  The ladies that helped me are very nice and the food was awesome.  I highly recommend the artichoke dip and the Alfredo tortellini.  To top it off I ordered 20 minutes before they closed and picked the food up 2 minutes prior to closing.  I will be returning regularly after discover this place."}
{"text":"The food was awsome, Erin the server was very attentive. We had Italian sandwich and Meatball marinara sandwich and calamari as apetizer. I liked the garlic touch in the calamari ."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the other night. Food was great, and the personnel where attentive. Owner was constantly avalible to the customers and checked to make sure everything was as they wanted. Pricing is right ."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant twice now.  This is a family owned restaurant.  The owner and staff are awesome.  They make you feel as though you are part of the family.  The food is very good.  Dinners are served with salad.  You can choose a garden salad or a caesar salad.  On both occasions we had the  garden salad  which was simple but so fresh and yummy.  Last time, for dinner, I had the butternut squash ravioli (just ok) and the BF had the bolognese substitute homemade fettucini.  His dish was delicious!  This time I had he eggplant rolatini.  It was two very small pieces of rolled eggplant with marinara sauce over them.  Very tasty but they looked so sad on the plate all by themselves. It is served with a side of pasta that is in a separate bowl so definitely enough food.  BF had the porchetta with rigatoni.  OMG!  Once again, delish.  So far, it seems that the meat dishes are a big hit.  Next time I'm going to try the clams linguini though.  They also have a nice wine selection that is decently priced.  The food prices are reasonable as well.  Just go...you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Always looking for good Italian, and this hit the nail on the head! We started with a High West Whiskey Cocktail and a Tiramisu Martini. Both were delicious in their own right. Dinner was even better. My partner had the Rigatoni Al Forno. The red sauce was incredibly seasoned and definitely not from a can. I enjoyed the Wild Mushroom Fettucini and added the Chianti Braised Beef. We enjoyed every last bite of our meals and sadly were unable to order dessert as a consequence. We will definitely be back and possibly start with the dessert next time!"}
{"text":"I like Zappone's a lot!  The best part is that it is reasonably quiet so I could have a long lunch and great conversation with a friend.  The music is of varied types, but kept very low.  The food was very good.  The service was excellent.  Megan was very skilled at being at the table at just the right times and not being an intrusion otherwise during our leisurely lunch.  We shared a big salad first...excellent...followed by a pizza.  The pizza was slow to arrive which didn't matter as we had salad and were in no hurry.  When it did arrive it was excellent, great crust.  Later Megan brought us complimentary cannolis because the pizza was delayed.  She explained the chef wasn't happy with the crust on the pizza and remade it for us, thus the delay. I didn't love the large, painted ads in the front windows...tacky.  Otherwise, it was excellent.  I will be back. It was was an excellent lunch experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I took my 2 boys for a quick dinner. They both loved it as well. My youngest said he's coming back every day. This is everything you want from an Italian Bistro: great flavors, fresh ingredients, varied menu, an atmosphere that's casual enough to run in for a quick bite but nice enough to linger over a bottle of wine, and a price point that keeps the value in the bistro restaurant. Well done Zappone's!"}
{"text":"This was a nice experience. The restaurant was not busy at the time, around 3:00 pm. The server was very good, friendly and sincere. The spaghetti and meat ball bowl was excellent, and it was for only $5.99! I would definitely go back again the next time I drop into town."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and my daughter is a picky eater. I stopped by to order a to-go plate  plain speghetti. This place looks and smells amazing. The lovely hostess was sweet and enjoyable. Thank you Zappones for the noodles. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Forget reading all reviews and just go!!!  This place is awesome!!!  My husband is culinary trained and it's hard to find a restaurant where he is happy to spend his money.  Well this is one of the very few.  Every plate of food we have had in the place has been delicious.  You can tell it is family ran because you can taste the love and the joy of cooking in the food.  And the dessert.... there are just no words so order it or if you are full take it home with you.  I am so glad we found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  First time was eh... 6.5 out of 10, so thought I would give it another try thinking it would be better the second time around.  Shamefully disappointed with the second.  I ordered a \"Margherita pizza w/ pepperoni to go\"  Not too hard right? (i.e. basil, mozzarella, marinara, w/ pepperoni).  I got home and saw it had no basil, but that was only part of it.  The ingredients they put on were so cold that it made a big sloppy mess once the pie warmed up; the ingredients never cooked.  By the time I got home, the pizza box was soaked through from the liquid coming out of the ingredients, and it was only three ingredients!.  No one likes a soggy bottom...I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  Food was a hit from beginning to end. House made bread was perfect and started things off just right.  The bread really captured the Southern Italian flavor I prefer.  The chef and owner was super kind and came out to our table. Service was right there too we didn't want for anything. I had the eggplant and I would highly suggest that.  I was with two other folks and we all enjoyed the entrees. We missed the pizza and will be sure to try that next time.  Super authentic, definite attention to the \"little\" things - I am looking forward to going back.  Get the Cannoli - they make it to order - like they should !"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese is an original take- if it wasn't called mac and cheese I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be mac and cheese.  And it's excellent!  The penne ala vodka, the margherita pizza, and the house salad were great, too!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Zappone's!!! My fiance and I decided to have our engagement party here, and the food is amazing. From the bruschetta trio to the salad to the bread to the chicken marsala and penne to the cannoli.....EVERYTHING was spot on! The service was great and our guests wanted for nothing. And it was extremely reasonable! Dina didn't even charge me for two people when they cancelled on me the morning of the event. She updated quotes as the number of guests increased, was always quick to respond to emails or texts, and even let us store our cake there for several hours before the event. She made up the most darling little menu cards with our names, the date, and the menu. Thank you Zappone's for making our event memorable on a budget. My compliments to Dina and Sal."}
{"text":"Forget Olive Garden!!!! This place is amazing. Authentic food and attentive waitstaff. This is our new favorite Italian restaurant. The chicken Marsala was amazing and the lasagna, forget about it. Hands down as real as in Sicily."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is off the chart amazing for Italian food.  The prices are incredibly reasonable.  Everything was made to order in the kitchen by the owner Sal.  He does not skimp on quality and you can taste it in the dishes he prepares.  I am so picky about Italian food and this is the best in Arizona.  I truly felt like I was in little Italy in New York eating at 5 star restaurant that has been open for over a hundred years.  After speaking with Sal I know why.  His family is from Italy and his grandmother and mother taught him how to cook Italian food at a young age.  After years of training in the restaurant industry He and his wife decided to take a leap of faith and open up this restaurant 7 months ago.  It doesn't matter where you live in Arizona, You have to make this a must stop!  We tried The Amatriciana(absolutely incredible), the porcini raviolis, chicken parmesan, and this cheese stuffed pastry dessert, which was to die for.  We also ordered the calamari, but not fried, sautéed in a red sauce that was exquisite.  This wasn't on the menu but we asked to have this made.  I am looking forward to taking the next cooking class he offers and attending a wine dinner in the future.  Don't forget to take a loaf of bread home for sandwiches or French toast the next day. And most importantly they do 50% off bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  We had the Vitiano, Italian Blend which was a great bottle with a full flavor.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic home made bread, easy to OD on the bread.  Had pizza one time, it was very soggy.  All pasta dishes have been exceptional."}
{"text":"3 THINGS:  1) Zappone's Italian Bistro's serving staff is top notch; They are efficient and fluid with their techniques. i.e. Our server was very respectful of our large family group at Mothers Day brunch and was receptive to re-filling half-filled glasses with jaguar-like stealthiness as not to interrupt our conversation during an already overly-busy day....huge kudos for doing that. 2)  I'm a self-proclaimed salad connoisseur. The Italian Chopped Salad is off the charts. We are talking a finely chopped dark green romaine salad...none of that cheap light green salad...also it is chopped 1 cm x 1 cm on average. FINE! Mix in equally finely chopped Italian salami, fresh mozzarella, olives, red peppers, drizzled with a fine red wine vinaigrette. I only wish I took a photo before I inhaled this salad. Good sized salad too.  3)  I'm sure the other entrees are as good as their Italian Chopped Salad which means I can't wait to go back to try their Spicy Italian Calzone."}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal and service. Ordered their special for Monday night, spaghetti with meatball and house salad. Also ordered their pistachio cheese cake that was so creamy. I have found a new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"We just came back from your Valentine special. WOW!!!! The food was amazing, the best flavoured soup I have ever eaten. The pasta was done to perfection and the steak and lobster my husband had was so tender he could cut it with a fork. The service was wonderful on such a busy night. Thanks for giving us the best Valentines night ever! Last year we were in Florida and this was so much better."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars for the following: the staff and management are nothing short of excellent. They truly made sure I was a happy customer. I recommend visiting this restaurant on that basis. The quality of their food seems to very high - all I tried tasted fresh and served at the appropriate temperature.  That said, I did not like the taste of their food. Not at all. The marinara sauce was a bright red tomato sauce that was to me, very bitter. Not tangy, but bitter. The Italian chicken soup was also bitter, seemingly too spicy.  Overall, 5 stars for the staff and management,  no stars for food taste meant to me 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful.  We started with the fried artichoke, which was very lightly breaded and a delicious dipping sauce.  Janessa I think was our server and Was very efficient and pleasant.  The Chicken Saltimboca was outstanding!  The only reason I did not give 5stars is there is no atmosphere.  It is in a strip mall but it would not be a Saturday night date choice.  It is all tables with nothing, not sure if it meant something but a car painted on the wall.  Let's make it look Itallian.  Maybe some red checkered table clothes, a candle on the table, a scene from Italy on the wall.  Some screens or plants to offer a little separation.  This place is awesome just need to ambience."}
{"text":"Not an Italian Fan but the seafood fettuccine was good as well as the warm olive appetizer. Nice and close to the hotel so I may have to try it again next week!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can\" t believe we have not gone to this place before. What great food and service. We started out with the Bruschetta trio, which was one the best I have ever had . The bread is incredible and the toppings are so fresh. Next time I could just order a couple of those and a few  beers and be a very happy man. Anyway we also had veal which was awesome and an order of pasta with meatballs and sausage. The sausage was good but the meatballs were probably in the top 5 of all time. Listen I am Italian and I have eaten alot of meatballs in my time but these are some of the best, not as good as mine but up there. Try this place, you will luv it."}
{"text":"Yummy. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and my husband got Chicken Parmesan, both were delish!  The side Caesar salad was great too. Service was timely..highly recommend"}
{"text":"Just heard about Zappone's and so we tried it out for lunch. First impression are important. Mine was that someone needs to change the mop bucket (was Bieber in there?). Walked through the door and was greeted by a putrid smell; like the floor had been mopped with a mildewed mop. Not very appetizing,  but we stayed. Server was quick to seat us and take our drink orders and bring out some bread with a small cup of olive oil/balsamic. I ordered the Penne Rose and lunch buddy ordered the Spaghetti Marinara.  The penne dish was tasty, but not remarkable. Lunch buddy felt the sauce on her spaghetti shouldn't be described as marinara; it was just sauce.  We weren't impressed, but may give it another try."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time with excellent food and live music on a Saturday night. My wild mushroom fettuccine with chicken was to die for and the creme Brule cheesecake was out of this world. No waiting on the day after Christmas. ..a major plus in our eyes...when though the place was hopping!"}
{"text":"To start with Sally and I loved this place but we were hungry, and this is our first visit. I had the butternut squash. It is outstanding. The house salad was crisp, fresh and a very good flavor, Sally had the Caeser salad and it was also very good. Sally had the baked Penny and she loved it, quantity was ample she couldn't finish it. I had the chicken Saltimbocca. This was outstanding. It was a chicken Marcello plus chicken Parmesan plus, plus, very good I would give it a five out of five. We will be back"}
{"text":"This was a great stop to satisfy an Italian craving. I loved that \"Extra Virgin\" (Debi Mazar + hubby cooking show) was on in the background in the lunch hour. A solid offering and lots of power flavors from the antipasto plate to the pasta."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem their 2nd day in business. I had no idea it was day 2, and was super surprised when I found that out. This family's spin on homemade Italian is some of the best I have ever had. Even though I never was able to frequent the place more than once every 2-3 months, they always remembered me when I walked in. They always remembered my regular order, including the drink. And what can I say about the bread, it's amazing. I salivate just thinking about it, even though I haven't been in Arizona to go back in a year and a half. I would gladly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Great food, great experience."}
{"text":"Went to a cooking demonstration and had a wonderful time! The menu was Panzanella, Spinach and Cheese Ravioli with vodka sauce (homemade pasta!), Tuscan Roasted Chicken with Potatoes, and Limoncello Tiramisu. We were shown how to make every dish, given full size portions of each course and a glass of wine for just $35! Fantastic food, charming chef owner too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"had a great dinner. The Veal dish was excellent. Love their Margareta's. Also, the artichoke appetizer was fantastic and a pretty big portion. only reason for 4 stars was the service was a little slow but they were pretty busy. will go there for dinner again"}
{"text":"What can I say Zappones has some of the FINEST Italian food in the valley, The staff and owners here are wonderful accommodating people and my wife and I will continue to go here for some kickin appetizers and pastas.  I worked with them to put together an amazing grooms dinner at their restaurant and I lost count at the amount of compliments we got for how this place rivals some of the best in NY. Mind you my whole Italian family flew in from NY and have run an Italian speciality store and we're impressed!"}
{"text":"Moved to Chandler 2 years ago from NY. We have found a few Italian restaurants in the area but this place is by far the best. The service and wait staff are amazing. The shrimp Rosa with homemade fettuccine is my favorite.   The husband and wife are always there engaging with there customers. They truly care about everything going on and it shows.   Just my opinion, I can boil water at home and empty a box of pasta into the water. When we go out to eat, fresh pasta is a treat.  This place reminds me of Home, truly a gem. Give it a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"**To-Go Order**  I was craving Italian so naturally I turned to Yelp for something close. I called in my to-go order and was helped by a very happy and helpful hostess. I asked questions about their menu and she explained in great detail about the entree's. I ended up ordering the Chicken Picatta (I am a sucker for lemon and capers.) The chicken was cooked right, the cream sauce was okay it could have used more seasoning. The spinach was good, but the sauteed veggies were a little on the mushy side. The meal came with a mini salad which was fresh and their pesto dressing which was enjoyable. My brother ordered the Spaghetti & Meatballs, which he said was good and noted the sauce was a little on the sweet side.   All in all it was an \"A-Ok\" experience. The food was prepared quickly and the service was friendly and well priced."}
{"text":"I am having horrible heartburn. I was up all night and was throwing up. Thats partly due to my stubborness for not getting antiacid. My wife did the smart thing. I had beef sliders.   Nice atmosphere, tables too small. The table we were seated was wobbly. Service was slow. Took about one hour to get our main dishes. Bruschetta was OK but could have been better.   Waitresses did not know which dish was which when food was served. I decided to skip. Once biten twice shy."}
{"text":"Overall this is a nice place that I enjoyed, but my wife wasn't overjoyed with; I wouldn't mind going there again.   Calimari appetizer was quite good, lightly fried, not rubbery, good sauces, one with some kick. The bread we got was a bit of a disappointment; it wasn't warm or very flavorful. Caesar salads were average, and took a while, even though we got there before the dinner rush on a Saturday night.   I had the chicken marsala, my wife had the shrimp scampi with Alfredo sauce. I enjoyed the chicken, which came with a size of spaghetti with mushrooms, which was also good. My wife didn't care for the shrimp scampi and found the Alfredo sauce thin, though I found it flavorful and think the shrimp were prepared perfectly. Neither of us knew what to make of the large red onions in the dish. (They were out of the homemade butternut squash ravioli, even though the dinner rush had just started. I didn't find that out til I ordered it.)   Great, attentive service. Not much for ambience. Just a big, open room, somewhat brightly lit for dinner. FYI happy hour is 3-5 daily; some earlier reviews reported 3-6."}
{"text":"My Husband & I came here Friday to celebrate our 10th Anniversary....worst service ever. We waited at least 20 minutes to just order our food then another 30 minutes to get our food. Anytime we needed anything it took forever just for our waitress to acknowledge us & to get the bill took about another 20 minutes. On top of that food was just OK, wasn't anything special. We have been to other places that are WAY better like Babbo's. We won't unfortunately be coming here again. I would rather go somewhere with better food & SERVICE."}
{"text":"So life has been pretty stressful lately.  Gravity appears to becoming stronger, or I'm gaining weight.  Somebody is dying my perfectly black hair with some stray white ones.  My friends claim that I'm in denial, but they just don't realize I will never turn 30.  I have some wedding vows to write, and a tennis buddy insists that it will come to me at a sushi restaurant after 2 sake bombers, and I'm almost desperate enough to go that route.  North Korea seems to want to play with nukes.    But you know what really bothers me?  Zappone's Italian Bistro having only 3.5 stars.  Are you kidding me Arizona?  Fine, I'm getting older and gaining weight and graying out, fine I'll probably plagiarize somebody's vows online, fine another Korean War is inevitable, but no freaking way is Zappone's 3.5 stars.    We've been coming here since December, and probably been back about half a dozen times.  The interior is very smartly designed with a modernist look but also comfy booths and bar/counter top seating throughout.  The food is expertly made, and just tonight I had a gnocchi special that blew my mind- great chew on this freshly made pasta with every bite having a little uniqueness, coated with pancetta, onions, chili flakes, in a rich, slightly tart marinara sauce.  My fiancee had a lovely spinach ravioli special, that was Miss America pretty to look at but Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition satisfying.  Their house salad is a little different every time, this time sporting more sweet  peppers than normal but perfect for me, though YMMV.  Their calamari had a perfectly light breading, and extremely thinly sliced lemon was also battered and flash fried to make a perfect accompaniment to the marinara sauce.  Prior visits had the lasagna, tortellini, and spaghetti ala mare been extraordinarily enticing.    The only Italian restaurant I've had in the east valley that compares to Zappone's is La Calabria, and the cost is probably about half of theirs.  The staff has been ridiculously welcoming, and service has been comfortable yet still professional.  I've always had to drive a fair distance to get an Italian meal I really enjoyed, but am ecstatic that I've got a great restaurant about 2 miles away.  If you're still reading my review you must have a lot of patience, and you should reward yourself with a visit to Zappone's.  Be forewarned however, you might just fall in love with the food, write silly reviews, maybe even belittle the seriousness of Korean War part deux- and like me, find that it was all totally worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were wanting a little Italian food that was super close to the house.  We really enjoyed this little place!  IMPECCABLE  service and great food!  We started with the Bruschetta appetizer, it was very good!  I had the chianti braised beef rigatoni.  It was just what I was in the mood for!  Thick, tender, and delicious.  Paired it with a Super Tuscan blend.  Very tasty. My woman got the margarita pizza.  She loved it.  I tried a piece and I enjoyed it.  Pretty greasy, but we like that.   Overall, this place isn't gourmet by ANY stretch, but if you want some straight forward Italian food in the East Valley, I would recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"When we want Italian we go to Zappones--very close to our home and every dish has been fantastic!!! Have to say that the pizza is in my top 5!!! Love supporting local businesses and highly recommend trying them out"}
{"text":"Authentic food that radiates flavors of fresh garlic in the luscious sauce and meatballs, delicious mushrooms,  and slow braised meet. I give this fabulous place my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Zappone's is still new, but you can tell they really care about producing quality food and providing great service. I've tried several of the dishes and so far the standouts were the house made Fettucine Bolognese, the Bruschetta and Pizza. The Pork Milianese Sandwich was a little on the dry side. Could use a punch of sauce. All in all, great start so far, looking forward to going again and seeing them find their groove."}
{"text":"What a great find, we found this little Italian restaurant in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you the food is amazing.  Meat from Chicago, homemade bread, and pasta cooked RIGHT!  Which is hard to find in Arizona.    Check this place out before you can't get in, when everybody finds out how good it is."}
{"text":"East Valley, very good Italian food, very friendly and attentive customer service, nice selection of wines. Ok, now for the review. I had the manicotti and Susan had the antipasti. Both were very good and we are anxious to try something else on the menu. The bread is made by the chef and very good. They did not get 5 stars because I think the ambiance could be improved on. I have always heard when restaurants start painting advertising on their windows it means their business is slacking off. When we walked up I said uh oh... painting on the windows. Fortunately the pizza advertising didn't take away from our experience."}
{"text":"Zappone's ToGo was GREAT! i was dining alone, and i was glad to take it home with all my \"Nom-Nom\" sounds! It. Was. Delicious! My first time here, i asked Sarah what she suggested, and the Wild Mushroom fettuccine with Chianti braised beef was FANTASTIC! They took as much care as they would had i dined in. The plate came out hot, the house salad was fresh and tangy, and the BREAD?? THE BREAD WAS PERFECTO! so tasty and chewy, perfect with pasta. If you are carb-watching, just resign yourself to going to the gym nextdoor- do not skip on the bread. The price was fair, considering the pasta came with salad and bread, plus the delicious quality. I cannot wait to come back to eat in, and try the other options!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a quaint neighborhood restaurant. Wine selection was good and the food was even better. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable.  This will definitely become a usual stop."}
{"text":"I've been here two more times now dining in, and I haven't been as impressed as my initial visits where I only did take out.  Service is definitely an issue. It takes awhile for the food to come out. Our salad came out with our pizza just as I was ready to cancel it. The female owner is an amazing hostess and server, but the other waitstaff is inexperienced and don't have the same \"hustle\" that she does.   I am still in love with their fresh baked bread, but when it's served at the restaurant, it comes with awful olive oil for dipping. It's totally flavorless. One the plus side, the starter salad was even better than what I remembered from take out. Perfectly dressed with green olives and roasted red peppers. I got the eggplant parm (off the menu), and I was warned it was non-traditional i.e. no breading. It was great! But the pasta it came with was almost drowning in oil.  I was disappointed with the funghi pizza that we got. The mushrooms were underseasoned, and the truffle oil made it taste a little off. Hey all restaurants, can we agree to stop using truffle oil? It's just chemical flavoring and has nothing to do with a real truffle ::::end rant::::  I would still recommend Zappone's but with some reservations."}
{"text":"I have been traveling to Arizona since 1998 visiting family. I am there at least every other month.  when my family told me that this Italian restaurant opened. we had to go check it out - being Italian and from the east coast, I am happy to say, this is PHENOMENAL !!  turns out, the owner is from my hometown!!! it is a small world and although he moved out west in the 90's - and I didn't know him from back home because he is younger than me, his calling was to open this restaurant!!! my family goes there every week or so. and when I am there to visit, it's our go to place! everything is excellent.  sandwiches, salads, entrees, and desserts, leave room for dessert!! they  make you feel like family when you walk in! they are so friendly and it is a very casual atmosphere. and they cater too! so if you are having a party, have them cater!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood spot! The food is delicious, service is outstanding, and the cheesecake is amazing! We always enjoy coming in for wine, appetizers, dinner and dessert! Love it here!"}
{"text":"We had an event catered for 10 people recently and our experience was amazing. We had very particular food restrictions that I thought might be difficult for an Italian restaurant (wheat and dairy free). Dina was amazing and very easily accommodated our request. she came up with an awesome chicken dish with a side of roasted veggies and an salad and right at the price point we were looking for. It was delicious, everyone here loved it."}
{"text":"Zappone's is very close to our house, and we enjoy the food. I wish their Alfredo sauce had a little more flavor (like some more garlic flavor maybe?) but we will come back. We went on a Friday once and were plesantly surprised by the live music! That singer actually helped me (unintentionally) pick a song for our first dance at our wedding by playing a Jason Mraz song! :)"}
{"text":"Had the Braised Beef, Homemade Cheese Ravioli with Meat Sauce and the Lobster Diablo. Trio of Bruschetta was STELLAR! Apples, honey. Caprese. Fig and Prosciutto. Whoa! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"AZ italian food continues to disappoint. There was one redeeming quality...the bread...and maybe the salad.   The red sauce was flavorless and I've had better out of a jar (victoria's is great btw), nothing like you'd find in nyc or boston.   Eggplant parm was not properly prepared. Eggplant was was bitter and not salted and rinsed... Not a fan.   The calamari was chewy but the garlic was a nice addition, could be overpowering for some.   Service was amateur hour at it's finest. I could hear the servers at the bar area loudly discussing amongst each other about their shifts, how the kitchen was backed up, and orders coming out wrong, etc... No one wants to hear that.   Needless to say I won't be back nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"The good: pasta perfectly cooked, good homemade fettuccini, waitress was friendly, pumpkin cheesecake, wine The bad: depressing music, salad was overly dressed and soggy, bread dry, place was cold and empty"}
{"text":"We received correspondence from this spot. Thank you for taking your time.  We did verify the number we provided to GrubHub. It was a working number. We also rang the spot when the promise delivery time was not fulfilled to follow up with our order. All we were told was \"It's on the way!\" With a bit of an annoyed and hurried tone from the lady we spoke with. Hung up without letting us interject with our inquiry.  We love supporting mum and pop local shoppes. But we require proper service. One of them is keeping what was promised - timely delivery. Waiting for delivery of cold pizza, and appetizer for nearly two hours... Is not at all timely."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place has the best Italian food. So light, so fresh. Excellent chef and menu. We went on a night when they were having Dueling Pianos. Some good laughs and a few sing alongs. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"omfg why does yelp make we type so much. isn't a simple star enough?"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, atmosphere was nice. The pasta we ordered was good, but the pizza was only so-so.   We requested to move tables after the waitress mopped up a spilled drink. The mop's disgusting stench filled the air. If you're reading this, clean it in some bleach or something!"}
{"text":"Great food, I had the chianti braised pasta, generous amount of braised beef with gravy over pasta, small bits of veggies throughout.  My mom had the penne al vodka.  I think I liked that dish even better.  Great light & tasty house salad.  I read reviews before going,  somebody said they didn't get the 4 or 5 star reviews.  Well, I didn't get your two star review.  I can't wait to try other menu items.  Salted caramel Gelato....the bomb"}
{"text":"I like this place, I live across the street, so I go here a lot, but I do have one complaint.  If I am going to pay $14 dollars for pasta, sauce, and  is described to have rapini in it, then I sure hope I am actually getting rapini and not frozen broccoli..  I do know the difference and I was not happy that my pasta as described with rapini was merely brocolli..... so that is all I wanted to say.  If I am wrong and you absolutely 1000% only serve rapini, then I would like to see proof. Thank you  oh, and also.. the ceasar salad was drenched in cheap parmesan.. whatever happened to shavings?"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Zappone's Italian Bistro and been to an event catered by them. The food was delicious. The red gravy has been consistently tasty without an acidic bite. The Pizza has a nice flavor. The beef was out of this world!   By the way, over the holidays, a week or so ago, I brought a couple of their, pipe it yourself, cannoli kits to parties I attended. Everyone loved them, too! (and  of course, I gave them the credit)  If you enjoy authentic Sicilian style Italian cooking you will enjoy the food at Zappone's Italian Bistro."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant, not just in the East Valley/ Gilbert but all of Arizona. Great pizza and sandwiches with friendly staff and a quaint ambiance. This is our go to place for good Italian."}
{"text":"Been there several times. Food is very good but this time the service was way below their standards. We had to wait for EVERYTHING. We began to think we had been forgotten even though we were in plain sight. Took quite awhile to get our drinks and another very long time for the waitress to come back to take our order. Then had a long wait before our salads arrived. And so on........  Not a good experience this time. Hope they fix this."}
{"text":"My first experience with them was not the best, although after the follow up I received from the owners I gave them another try! The service was great and food was delicious! Can't wait to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Waited over an hour and a half to get our food and then it was not hot. We continually asked when we would be getting our food and the answer was always \"you're up next\". It was very tasty and would have been more appreciated arriving sooner and hot.  I would not go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We had high hopes as we headed out to Zappone's for dinner. We are big pizza aficionados. We brought our son, daughter in law and grand baby with us. We both ordered the pizza margarita. We were very disappointed. I give them one star for using fresh buffalo mozzarella, but other than that, it was bland. The sauce had not a lick of flavor. The pizza was almost a liquid, melted mess. It had no flavor at all. The crust was probably ok, but without any flavor in the sauce it tasted like nothing. Each pizza was $18, for cheese pizza. I had hoped with all these 5 stars it would be like Pizza Bianco, but alas, it was not. The waitress was very nice and the establishment was clean. That's about it. Also we ordered the Caesar salad. Again, no real flavor at all. Sorry Zappone's. We really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"Zappone's is my restaurant of choice for Italian food! The meals are consistently fresh and the staff is always attentive without being intrusive. It's a great spot for a date night where you can enjoy a conversation and not feel rushed. The live entertainment adds to the cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is delightful....the owners, the staff, the ambiance, and especially the food.  The gluten free chicken piccata was DELISH!  It's a great place to take your family for dinner or maybe go on a little date night with your hubby.  You must try a home made dessert  after your meal or you will definitely being missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for!! Best Italian restaurant I've ever been to hands down. Everything from the food to the staff is absolutely impeccable. Everyone always makes sure you feel welcomed and leave happy. (Especially the owners Sal & Dina!) The food is very authentic, service is fast, and food is delicious! These are the little golden, hidden places that yelp is made for. If you're around the area I totally recommend coming here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I called with an urgent need to send food to a family after a tragic loss. I spoke to Dena and she was so kind and helpful and was prepared to have the catering delivered in an hour. When I called back to let her know I had to change the delivery time she was gracious and understanding. I wish more business practiced this kind of customer service. Thank you Dena!"}
{"text":"Really impressed!  First of all, I didn't expect to find an Italian restaurant of such high quality in the suburbs of Phoenix.  The service was on point as well!  I had a hard time choosing what to get because everything on the menu looked awesome.  Finally I decided on the rolled eggplant which came with a side of pasta.  It was a nice, well-seasoned, light dish and was also a perfect portion (quality over quantity!).  All of the pasta dishes/entrees come with either a caesar or house salad as well.  Huge plus!   We loved the complimentary bread and so happy to be given both olive oil and butter.  Also, the waitress informed me almost all the pastas are made in house except one or two (can't remember which) and had one that was out.. I LOVE hearing this because you know what you're getting is FRESH!   Everyone in our party loved their food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the last couple years and have always enjoyed the food and service.    My wife and I decided to order take out tonight and when I went to pick up the food I forgot to grab the garlic bread I purchased. Their employee Kaylee called and left me a voicemail and offered to take it off my bill if I didn't want to come back and grab it. I know that doesn't seem like a big deal, but I truly was impressed in their service. I'm happy that there is an Italian restaurant in the East Valley that has such great food AND customer service.     100% will recommend this restaurant to l my family and friends.    Ps. Spaghetti and meatballs! Get it!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Zappone's was early on a Tuesday. We were graciously greeted at the door and promptly waited on by Andre. To be sure Andre is one of the finest servers I've encountered in a long time. He was prompt, knowledgeable and seemed to honestly like working at the establishment as did all the wait staff we encountered. 5 stars to the staff.  We both chose the spaghetti and meatball $5.99 special which includes a house salad and bread.  The house salad was perfect 5 stars. The bread is house made with an excellent crust and texture but missing just something in the flavor. The spaghetti was good but the sauce not memorable. The meatball also was good but a little denser than we prefer.  3 stars for the spaghetti and meatballs.  I understand that the linguini and lasagna pasta is house made so will definitely come back to try them and give another sauce a try."}
{"text":"This is the best little Italian place we've come across in the Phoenix metro area so far. Their pizza and pasta are awesome and the pancetta is some of the best we've had in a restaurant. Definitely worth the stop"}
{"text":"You know I don't know what I was expecting when I walked in here with a friend to try it for the first time but I was impressed from the moment I opened the door. The decor is very tasteful and the atmosphere welcoming. We were dressed casually but as it is lunch hour nobody seemed to mind and most of the other customers were in work clothing and equally as casual dress.  The service was exceptional and the food was absolutely delicious. The pizza is some of the best I've had in the ten years I've lived here. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't. :)"}
{"text":"I came across Zappone's when I was looking for a restaurant to host my company holiday dinner.  My husband & I went there for a trial dinner & we were more than pleasantly surprised.  We felt like we were eating at a restaurant back in NY! The food was delicious & the staff was extremely pleasant & helpful.  Dina, the owner, was not only helpful with helping to plan the dinner but very easy to work with. We have since been back numerous times before my company dinner & will even be dining at Zappone's New Year's Eve.  We have found our new favorite neighborhood dining spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fantastic service!! Our waitress was amazing! We ordered the pizza and a Caesar salad. Both were great! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find when I came out for a Cardinals game from Las Vegas.  We stumbled upon here the first week they were open with friends that live in the area.  It is a cute place, designed for the local market with great food and service.  The Pizza, Chicken Parm and of course the sauce ... are awesome.   I cant wait to stop in again the next time I am in AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fresh made pasta!  Great service. Had the Chicken Marsala, probably the best I've ever had.   Love this place, never get ti  As usual, Sal and Dina have done an amazing job on Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"One of my favs.  Food is awesome, staff is great, they just remodeled and it looks great,,,Stop by for their great lunch specials too!!  The owners work every day and are committed to you having a wonderful dining experience"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find. I was craving pasta and clams. Very tasty and light. I was told Pastas are homemade as are the breads. This is true. Best small salad to finish this delicious fare.  The staff is excellent, Kailey was informative and helpful. Dina introduced herself after the meal, she oversees this quaint and delightful bistro. Great experience and plenty of items to look forward to at my new favorite Italian place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Everything great about this place is all about the food. Did I mention that the food was great? The service was good as well and they were super busy.  Now for the other stuff: Live music courtesy of Dan the guitar guy. Per the flyer that I folded up and put under the leg of our table to stop it from wobbling, he plays everything and takes no breaks. At least he played some classics like That's Amore! Just kidding, he didn't . Lightning Crashes..very romantic.  Please takes some breaks!   Very small and very loud.  I'll be going back because the food is that good. They do take-out. :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  The owners and wait staff are wonderful and the food is delicious.  I highly recommend Zappone's Italian Bistro."}
{"text":"Wow! I am Sicilian and I have never left a restaurant being this impressed... Other than my Nanas kitchen it's pretty hard to satisfy me when it comes to Italian food. Thank God I found the spot! I had the braised beef pasta dish, The beef melted in my mouth. The sauce is light and decadent while being rich and satisfying. There is so much beef in this dish just when I wanted another bite I would flip over a pasta and find another mound of it. I cannot wait to work my way down this entire menu. Grazie e perfecto!!"}
{"text":"Update: The owner of the restaurant promptly contacted me after I wrote my review, Apologizing and offering to make it right. I appreciate that. It shows good stature on their end. I will up my rating from 1 to 3.     Went here with my husband and two small children March 21 2018. The service was horrible. I understand being busy, which they were, but completely unorganized and poor attitudes. It took 25 minutes before our order got taken. 5 minutes till drink order 10 min for drinks another 5 after I had to ask for a kids menu for the second time and another 5 after they left us again so we could look at the kids menu which took 2 seconds. After waiting another 20 min for food, a different waitress brought our food out. Saying \" enjoy your food okay\" walked away with an attitude. We hadn't said anything or complained nothing to deserve this type of crappy attitude.  The food was not the tastiest. My kids pizza was burned, my noodles weren't fully cooked it just wasnt what I was reading in the reviews. Totally the reason why we went there in the first place. This place needs help and the staff needs an attitude adjustment. Very poor service. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Had seen the chef on a local TV show, so met friends there for dinner, was very disappointed.  I know they make their own bread, we received 4 small slices for 4 people.  Food was OK, but not anything to rave about.  Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the different sizes of noodles. If you order  fettuccine noodles instead of spaghetti noodles they charge $2.00 more. Also the garlic bread portions are either generous or skimpy depending on \"how he slices the bread'. This used to be our favorite restaurant but to be sooooo trivial about these things has turned us away! And when we ordered the fettuccine noodles not once did the server mention that there was an additional charge for the noodles."}
{"text":"I am not much of an Italian food eater, but I really enjoyed my Chicken Piccata with a side salad and side of Angle Hair Pasta.  You get all of this for the cost of your entree. I was with a party of nine and everyone enjoyed what they ordered from the Fritio Misto, Veal, Pizza, chicken, and Marscopone Cheesecake to the Americano coffee. Portions are healthy and most come with a salad (house or Ceasears) and a side of Pasta. You get to choose your Pasta and  Pasta sauce. They are so flexible and accommodating. Hannah is the owner and is a working owner. You can tell she loves what she does and takes responsibility. Dina the manager is right there with her. Our server Kaily was very knowledgeable about the menu and had also tasted the food so she knew what she was talking about. I highly recommend this restaurant. It is popular so be patient, it is worth the wait. Did I forget to mention the French bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil? It is a small serving, but do not be mad, helps leave room for dinner."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a second visit today with my Son for lunch. We liked that we could eat in a relatively quiet restaurant and peruse the menu without being rushed.  Today we both ordered calzones...my son had the spicy and I asked for one with mushrooms, sausage, & roasted onions . we both had marinara to dip.  As an added feature we opted to share a full order of Italian Chopped Salad so delicious I would order it again and savor it myself with either cheese or garlic bread. The calzones were large and not a disappointment but would have preferred asking that it be overstuffed next time maybe with more onions and mushrooms. I will consider ordering again but the flavor if the Chianti Beef from my first visit still lingers in memory.  I highly recommend the refreshing antipasto laced chopped salad and Chianti beef in any variation. I am surprised it is not on the Valentine Day special dinner...it is that good. We will be back...so many other menu items to try IF I can forego the Beef or Chopped Salad to try something else."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and was thoroughly impressed. I live literally two blocks away across Baseline so I was thrilled to have a very yummy place nearby. Here's what we ordered:  Cocktail -- Nicely done Negroni. It's so rare to find a Negroni on the drink menu at a restaurant 'round these parts. It's my favorite cocktail, so that's a huge plus.  Warm olives -- A very large portion in a generous serving plate. And the chef added fresh oregano to the olives, which was a bright addition to the dish. Very nice.  Calamari -- To my surprise, along with the tender calamari came paper-thin slices of breaded and fried lemon. Genius!! I've never seen that before, and what an amazing accompaniment.  Caprese salad -- Again, a generous portion and served with arugula, if I recall. Very fresh and outstanding use of ingredients.  Mushroom and Onion Pizza -- The crust was amazing. Best pizza for miles.   Dessert -- Three gelatos with cookies atop each serving. I was expecting a little melon ball's worth of gelato. But no, each one was more like a single ice cream scoop. You can't go wrong for $5.  To sum up, I think the chef must be making a good impression with super-large portions or promotional pricing, because the prices are honestly too low for the portions and the quality served here. It's a fantastic restaurant with outstanding food. I can't wait to try the entire menu. As an added bonus, kids meals are free on Saturday afternoons so my son's spaghetti and meatballs were on the house."}
{"text":"Great little gym just off the 60 in Mesa. Good daily special $6.99 for spaghetti and meatballs, can't beat it! Great service great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had lunch catered for a party.  We worked with Dina for the order.  Our order was ready when needed for pickup.  Everyone loved the food!  It was all so delicious and very reasonable priced!  We will definitely be ordering for future events again!"}
{"text":"I love the food, the service & the atmosphere!   Sal is the best!  I'll be there for date nite with the wife Saturday!  Mike"}
{"text":"Zappone's is a place we're going back to! The food was great and the staff was very friendly & helpful. Get the cheesecake ~ so good!"}
{"text":"Spaghettios and ketchup with taco beef I would say about their  gnocchi Bolognese  no flavor at all, very bland disappointed spent 16$ on crap!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to my favorite Italian restaurant, Zappone's, and the food was absolutely delicious. We had a big lunch so decided to try their pizza. It was fantastic! We ordered the 16\" \"Tuscan Chicken\" pizza with marinara rather than alfredo sauce and it was plenty of food for the two of us. The pizza had a very generous amount of chicken and the mushrooms & onions were cooked perfectly. It seems to me that every detail is important to the chef. While waiting for the pizza our server, Heather, brought out a delicious crusty bread with an aromatic virgin olive oil that we enjoyed. In the past we have ordered many of the entrees on the menu and the chef has a special touch. The servers are attentive & friendly. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys delicious food."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. We made our own - pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. Tina was our waitress and she was excellent. The owner came to our table to check on us. We brought our two small kids and they loved the food too. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood go to spot!! Everything is amazing---and they are always adding new things to the menu!!!  Staff is friendly and very accompanying! Loving \"giving the business \" to a locally owned restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Yum, got the lunch calzone, it's great, I can't believe I stopped eating it to write this review. Friendly staff. Great place."}
{"text":"I accidentally drove here thinking it was another restaurant and I am so happy I did. This place is off the charts!!! This is the first time I've had authentic Italian food and I can never go back. My boys loved it as well. Would've posted more pictures of the food if i wasn't so busy eating."}
{"text":"Last night we picked Zappone's for dinner to start our celebration of Dads 90th birthday.  Because there were 11 of us I want won't go into detail on each dish that we had but most of us we very happy and satisfied with what we ordered. For the 3 unfortunate family members that ordered the Saturday night special, they were left sitting looking hungrily at the rest of us as they finished their dish in just a few spoonfuls. DONT ORDER THE SPECIAL OF THE DAY.   Now I understand it's August and we are under an excessive heat advisory, however I do not want to go to a nice restaurant and sit and sweat throughout my entire meal. The thermostat was on the wall above our table and was reading 83 degrees. REALLY. I asked twice if they would please lower the A/C as it was very uncomfortable. My request was ignored.   I love Zappone's food which is one of the reasons we choose to have dinner here last night. I guess it's time to look elsewhere again"}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 tonight for the dueling pianos!  The service was amazing! We had the fried artichokes, they were delicious! We also had pizza and salad, everything was delicious.  On top of the food and service being fantastic, they also had entertainment! Az Dueling Pianos was so much fun! I love that there is somewhere close by that offers great food and entertainment!  Nice work!!"}
{"text":"We were here the other night for dinner and it was pretty good overall.   Nice atmosphere, small and cozy. Happy hour every day 3-6pm has some nice options for drinks, appetizers, and desserts that are very affordable.  Service was great, we were there pretty early for dinner, and we were greeted right away and never wanted for anything. They boxed the food up for us at the end which was nice.   We were initially brought some sourdough bread which was soft and delicious. Our meals included salads and I had the Caesar and my boyfriend had the house salad. He loved his house salad with red roasted peppers, tomatoes, and olives. Mine was not bad but really overdressed, the leaves were soaked in dressing which some people may like but was just a bit much for me.  We had the artichoke dip appetizer served with toasted bread slices and this was awesome (about 5 on the happy hour price). I really enjoyed this. For dinner I ordered the shrimp scampi linguine (14) with a pink scampi sauce which was good, but not something I'd order a second time. My boyfriend had the chicken alfredo (10) and he wasn't a fan, mostly due to the underseasoning. I liked it better than he did but I definitely thought both the chicken and the sauce was underseasoned. Dessert we ordered the warm chocolate cookie with gelato (4 on happy hour) which was good and gelato was excellent.   So overall, price is good, service for us was great, atmosphere nice and the food we had was either amazing or meh. I'd be happy to come here again but it won't become one of my local haunts."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout today pasta, couple of appetizers and a couple of sandwiches. Food as always was excellent and the service as well. Everyone always treats you like family."}
{"text":"Always the best. Love love love their cheesecake and their food is authentic Italian. I think I have had all their dishes and never been disappointed. Getting take out tonight because I don't want to cook."}
{"text":"The food, service, and happy hour are very good! The live music was nice and not too loud to have normal conversation. The fried artichokes and Capone pizza are a must try!  Go enjoy this place."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were driving around for about an hour trying to find somewhere to eat that we haven't tried before so after a while Zappones showed up on yelp and we decided to give it a try... Well we're super happy to say that we did! My hubby ordered the clams in a garlic cream sauce under the apps as his meal, I ordered the chicken piccata and our daughter had spaghetti w/meatballs and it was all so good!! Everything was very fresh and tasted amazing! The waitress was super sweet and knowledgable suggesting their specials and also telling us how the pastas and bread were made fresh in house;) my only complaint is the portions were a lil small but since it was so good I wanted more lol I actually found myself using the homemade bread to soak up the left over sauces on our plates because it was so good! We will be back for sure! Thank you Zappones for a great dinner experience!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I found this place and loved the service and the food so much that we are having Them cater our wedding. The owner Dina is amazing and the taste testing was delicious. Do not hesitate to hire them for any occasion."}
{"text":"Been there twice in 1 week, the food and service is amazing . My new favorite Italian restaurant by far. Can't wait To try some other stuff on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Listen - a lot of the pastas are homemade and even the ones that are not are perfectly cooked and the sauces are savory and delicious.  The bread is light and chewy at the same time and served with olive oil.  Salads are fresh and perfectly dressed.  Ambiance is very nice - mellow music, tasteful art.  Service is impeccable.  Only regret I had was not saving room for dessert.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went to Zappones today after purchasing a groupon, we are so happy to have found a great local Italian restaurant! We tried the caprese salad: arugula, grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella tossed in balsamic...delicious, very fresh. We also ordered a pepperoni mushroom pizza: thin, crispy, fresh. The ambiance is great, small, with a wine lounge and tall booths. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The rose sauce was excellent, as was the service.  Definitely try the Pancetta Dates, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"After seeing a review for New Years Eve in the Arizona Republic, we put it on out to br tried list.  Went Friday night and we were not disappointed.   We arrived before 6 and sat in bar area (its not a huge bar ) very nice.  We took advantage of happy hour appetizer, fried ravioli. The were hot and creamy on the inside. Perfectly fried. Crispy without having hard edges.   Entrees come with your choice of house salad or Caesar. We had one of each. The house salad comes with a light vinaigrette, fresh spinach and mixed greens, roasted red peppers and green olives  My husband had the butternut squash ravioli and what I can tell you is he did not offer to share and they did not have to wash his plate when it when back to the kitchen   I tend to order spaghetti and meatballs the first time I go to a neighborhood Italian resyaurant, sort of my judgement meal.  Now I don't want to try anything else it was so good.  I probably took more home than I ate.  The meatballs were over the top good.  We finished are meal with an Amaretto Marscapone Cheesecake.  It's a must try.  Almost hate to rate them well, afraid they will become too popular.  So happy to have found them, love having a good local Italian restaurant within 4 miles of home.  Can't wait to go back.   PS. Everything that went passed our table looked phenomenal"}
{"text":"Took my wife to dinner here, over the weekend, looking for a different Italian spot. The food & service were on point. The atmosphere was cool. My wife had the Chicken Parmesan & I had the Lobster Fra Diavolo, which we both enjoyed! I'd try it again!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  First time was decent because they had a deal through Yelp for an app, 2 entrees, dessert and a drink each for 30 or so bucks.  They screwed up my pasta but the server made up for it.  This time our server took our order and never came back.  Asked for bread 4 times and nothing until we were completely done.  Ordered spaghetti and sausage no cheese but they bring it with tons of cheese.  Sent back and wait for the new dish.  Had to practically beg for another drink because nobody came around.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly delighted by their fresh made bread. It was delectable. The staff was extremely friendly and made thoughtful dinner selection options.  Although, the sandwiches were reasonably priced and tasty, their chicken pesto sandwich loaded with mayonnaise gave me a wicked stomach ache. The jury is still out on that one. Having said that,  I would still recommend this place to friends and will be going back."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for some apps... amazing and great service!! Will be back for a full dinner service but this bruschetta is to die for."}
{"text":"I love this place! We only went once for happy hour, but we'll definitely be back. We had drinks and ate like pigs and the check was only $39. Even when it's not happy hour the prices are very good. And the server was wonderful and perfectly attentive. We had mussels, antipasta, pizza, truffle potato chips (YUM) and more and everything was very very good."}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing!! A little hole in the wall that I am so glad I found.   They have an amazing happy hour deal- 50% off their Italian wine bottles!!   I ordered their Lobster Fettuccine, which was freaking amazing. They are very generous with their lobster and the sauce was just amazing. My husband ordered their Seafood Fettuccine, which was also phenomenal. They basically put the entire ocean in the dish. Had plenty of mussel, shrimp, and calamari.   I am definitely going back soon for a date night with the hubby and saving room for dessert!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix visiting family and my parents said we had to go here.  They were right!  Chef Sal's food is delicious.  I just wish I could have kissed Mama Rosa for her spaghetti and meatballs.  My wife LOVED the lasagna.  We took the Calabrese pizza home and later it was wonderful.  The olives, calamari and antipasti plate will all be ordered again.  Next time we are in town we will bring more family and friends and hopefully be able to order one of everything!!!  Order at the counter and they will take care of the rest.  Wonderful food and service."}
{"text":"After a less than satisfying visit a few months back we recently tried their food again.  As previously stated, the Enzo pizza was good.  So were the lasagna and the penne in alfredo sauce.  Guess it depends on what you order, when you order it, and what your standards are."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Zappones. We had the mussels as a appetizer. Wonderful! I had the beef ravioli, Thom had the eggplant both were excellent. Deena and her staff were very attentive. When you in the mood for Italian come to Zappones"}
{"text":"We were looking for good Italian food and decided to try this place based on the reviews. The place was surprisingly packed for a rainy evening so we decided to wait the 20 minutes for a table. We ordered drinks while we waited and were a little disappointed that an $8 glass of wine was not filled at least half way. We were walked to a table that the hostess warned us was wet and we had to ask for it to be dried. Once we were seated and ordered, our very small salads came quickly but we had no silverware or napkins. Eventually we were able to let our server know and she fixed the problem.  The live music was fun but, a bit loud. This is definitely a family friendly environment as children were running between the tables going outside to play and marching back in between the tables while we were attempting to eat. This seemed to be the norm with the staff and the patrons. I have never seen such a thing.  The food was alright, it really was in dire need of some serious seasoning. My spaghetti tasted like pasta with tomato sauce and the chicken parmesan tasted like it came from the freezer. His small portion of chicken marsala was thin over some broccoli. The cannoli  had a strange flavor and the nuts on it made our mouths dry, not good.   Overall it was an alright experience, no where near all the great reviews it received. I don't know that we will be back.  Not a date night type of place."}
{"text":"I should try there pizza next time. I ended up getting the chef special spinach Ravioli and it was 7 small raviolis for around 13 or 14 dollars. I was told afterward that it was one of the smallest portions on the menu. I do not recommend it.  My wife ordered a sandwich and it was dripping with way too much oil. I told them that I would most likely not come back but I may try the pizza some day if that is what they are good at."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here for the first time last Sat & are going back this Sat. It was wonderful; everything from the staff to the service to the food was welcoming, delicious and extremely accommodating. Coming from NY we have found it hard to find good Italian food out here but Zappone's delivers on all fronts. Our waitress Kaylie was on top of her game & as nice as could be. We are totally a fan & can't wait to have another Zappone's dinner experience."}
{"text":"It's time once again to try a local place we have not been to. I was in the mood for Italian. Went to Yelp of course to look this place up and saw that they are getting good reviews so it was a go. We went yesterday (a Wednesday) around 4:00pm. We were the only ones there. Our server Tina, was very nice and very helpful. We told her this was our first time here and asked for suggestions. She brought us some home made bread with some olive oil to dip it in , yum! Next we had the Eggplant and zucchini flat bread appetizer, soooo good. Now time for our dinner. My wife ordered a new menu item, Chianti braised beef rigatoni, which she loved, and I had the Lasagna, which I loved. Both came with a side salad of your choice. Even the Iced Tea was really good! My glass was never empty, Tina made sure of that. We were both full, but we had to try a dessert to make this dinner complete. Our server once again gave us choices, and we shared a piece of homemade Coconut cheese cake. This is not New york style ,its made with Ricotta cheese, and it was so light, so..........GREAT! I don't really like Cheesecake, but this was such a nice change. I would come back just for this.   The only thing that would make this dinner better, a slightly larger serving of the Lasagna. The prices do run a bit higher then some places, but the quality of the food your are eating is worth it. The service was excellent, the food excellent!, we will be back! I give this place a big \"WOO HOO!\""}
{"text":"This place is a freaking disaster and nightmare. They have to be paying people to go on and write reviews because I can't believe anyone would actually return to this establishment.   First of all it's an Italian restaurant in a strip mall next to a sushi joint and a closed down Indian buffet. I don't know why that makes them think they can charge $13 a plate for chicken alfredo but regardless we ordered.   I ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the chicken alfredo. They both came with salads. I asked for blue cheese with my house (which I didn't get) and my boyfriend who hates salad got the Caesar. Ps we asked if he could substitute the small side salad for anything else like soup and the waitress said no.   The house dressing was so salty it burned my lips, sorry, I don't enjoy salt on my salad.   Then the food finally came and my boyfriends alfredo was dried out and again soooo salty and my lasagna... don't even get me started... disgusting... AGAIN SALTY... what is with the fricken salt!!  We were starving and hoping for large portions but we only managed to choke down half of our mediocre portions of overpriced food.  If you thought that was bad then you should hear about our drinks... My bf ordered bud light which they only had 2 bottles on site so then he had to drink their draft beer and pay the price of their stupid craft draft beer...   We finally got our check and I knew it was going to be expensive but the waitress charged me $7 each for my well vodka and diet drink... Who the H3LL charges $7 for a well drink!!?!? The BF's Bud Lights were $6.50 TOTAL. I thought it must be a mistake so I asked the waitress if that was the case (maybe she entered the drink wrong) which she did... It should have been $6 for a well and diet?!?!? WTH She said she would refund my $2 but by that point she could keep her $2 and shove it...   We promptly walked over to Desert Babes Sports Grille, where I got a well and diet for $3 my bf got a big bud light for $3.75 and ordered a delicious appetizer to settle our starving stomachs.  Horrible, expensive and disgusting.. I hope to g0d they close soon."}
{"text":"The Popeye pizza was very good.  That's about the only thing great. Dirty plate was brought to table.  Bread was brought only after having to ask.  There was no butter or olive oil served to go with bread.  Took server several minutes to bring Parmesan cheese to table after pizza was served.  They were out Ingrediants to make the orange mojito. Out of Bud Light.  Too many great options in Gilbert to go here again. Very disappointed.  Was looking for this place to be great."}
{"text":"Love Zappone's Bistro!  Great atmosphere, and the staff is really nice.  The food is great, and they are very accommodating with menu requests.  We love the Monday/Tuesday pasta special!  They also have fun special events.  So glad we live close by!"}
{"text":"I got the lasagna and it was absolutely delicious. My guest with me this evening received the fettuccine alfredo and she didn't like it. I tasted it and thought the same thing - it was bland. The owner's wife came out and was very kind and sweet and offered us replacement dish. So we got the chicken parmesan. Much better, so thanks to the owners wife and the waitress for being so responsive in this situation.   Cheers! We'll be coming back!!   Ps. After writing the review and the check came to the table, they had compensated chicken parmesan and the cannoli desert that we ordered; which was delicious by the way!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zappone's several times, usually for happy hour. Great ambience and the food is fantastic, particularly \"The Italian\" sandwich and their \"mini\" pizza which wasn't mini at all. The bread is addictive - be sure to ask for extra if you dine in. Service is always friendly and prompt. Even when I don't have time to dine in, it's great to swing by for take out!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly owners! Love that it's close to home so we can come often. The butternut squash ravioli is so yummy! We also love the fried ravioli and Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Zappone's is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in the Valley. Owners Sal and Dina Zappone are awesome. Sal makes the bread and pasta from scratch and everything we have there is delicious. Can't beat the half-priced bottles of wine on Tuesday. Live music on the weekend and special wine dinners that are reasonably priced keep us coming back at least every other week. See Sal on Sonoran Living and some other local morning shows. He's personable and fun!"}
{"text":"If you think Ragu is good spaghetti sauce and want to pay top dollar for it this might be the place for you. The eggplant rollatini was awful and tasteless. I'm not sure how the made the ricotta filling tastlest as well but it's actually impressive because they pulled it off. I scooped out the filling to taste it and it tasted like baked cottage cheese. The side spaghetti exposed the flavorless sauce that obviously came from a can. The Ceasar salad was good and the butterfinger cheese cake was decent. I would never go back and I recommend that anyone that has ever had good Italian food avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great little local italian joint, wife & tried it for the first time tonight.  She was very specific what she wanted ... Good Italian ... NOT a chain!  Her mom suggested Zappone's, so we decided to give it a shot.  We shared the Tomato Jam, Goat Cheese & Arugula flatbread ... really more like a pizza with those ingredients (with arugula put on after/fresh).  Delicious but about enough for 4 rather than 2 ... like many Apps go.  Literally it was more than I could've eaten for dinner if that was my only dish.  Wife got the homemade ravioli and liked the sauce and pasta filling just fine, but found the noodle portion a bit more 'al-dente' than she's used to.  Not worth sending back or anything as it wasn't 'crisp' (it's homemade, right, so it can't be), but a little more 'done' would've been nice.      On our waitresses suggestion (her name was Teresa and she was helpful, smiling, and attentive throughout, although we were her only customers on the patio outside), I tried the Chicken Saltimbucco (sp?) and boy that was a great call.  Starter Caesar was nice, though I like a LITTLE 'stronger' Caesar dressing than what they offer (a tiny bit more vinegar/lemon juice/salt in the mix relative to the other 'stuff' IMHO would make it perfect), but if you like a milder/cheesier Caesar you'll love it.  AFA the main course goes, the Chicken and it's sauce were delicious, those were perfectly cooked.  The veggies under the breast (zuchs, red bell peppers) could've stood to be a little more 'al-dente' but they weren't mush or anything, I still ate 'em right up.  That also came with a basic bowl of rigatoni w/alfredo & parmesan on the side, that was a nice compliment to the main dish.  Best of all, they had a 'live band' ... well, a dude with an elaborate drum machine/keyboard setup that made it sound like he was a whole band by himself, and he was great.  Played sweet 70's rock the whole time ... Eagles, Pink Floyd, Christopher Cross, Styx, that sorta stuff.  At the end of the night (we got there late) the guy even let me sit next to him at the mike and sing lead on a song while he played (and reminded me of the lyrics as we went along lol) ... We did a little \"Brown-Eyed Girl\", one of the wife's favorites.  Then I got him to close the night with Space Oddity (RIP David!) that I loudly sang along with from my table nearby, helped HIM remember the words on that one ... So that was FUN!  However, since he was playing somewhat loudly (not to me, but I could see SOMEone feeling it was loud) in the small dining room, it was not exactly quiet in there ... and dining room itself is relatively small and fairly tightly packed ... so, well, don't expect an quiet/intimate dinner unless you call ahead and make sure there's no 'band' playing when you're there.  Because of that we sat on the patio where we could still hear the music but still talk easily until we finished with dinner ... then we went inside to hang out and rock out.  Best of both worlds, you might say.  So ... food 4.0, service 4.5, band-dude 5.0 ... so let's round up and go with 5, esp. since they're a locally-owned business.  Remember ... BUY LOCAL, people!!!"}
{"text":"Why have I not been here yet! This is a neat find for sure. Customer service is fantastic. We came in with a large group (20ish). Not only did they accommodate us, they gave us service that was phenomenal. Drinks were always full and the staff was so friendly and helpful. If they do that with a large group, I cannot imagine what they would do with a small group.   The food.... Absolutely fantastic. I got the carleone and my wife got the mushroom fettuccini. The ingredients were fresh and the flavor was fantastic. You can taste the quality with every bite. Do yourself a favor and try the garlic cheese bread. It's so good!   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit and I found it to be just as excellent as the first.  Very friendly staff and great service.  Try the warm olives if you haven't already done so.  I am hooked!  On the first visit I had an Antipasto platter.  Very tasty and really fresh meats and cheese.  Today I had the Italian sandwich.  Wonderful meld of flavors!  By the time we were done with lunch there was only room for coffee.  The next visit I will start with dessert and then worry about lunch or dinner.  I highly recommend giving this family owned jewel a try."}
{"text":"This bistro offers Super yummy food and has become another favorite of ours .  This business is locally and family owned , offers a nice  variety of dishes to choose from .   We will be using their catering service in the near future and have found Dina Zappone to be more than helpful in creating our menu within our budget !"}
{"text":"It's definately on my hit list to be a regular. The food is great, the prices are good, and they have specials every day (Wednesday is half price on a bottle of wine). It's not big and the tables are not white cloth (not for a great romantic dinners) but a great place to meet family and friends."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome.  I love supporting family owned places.  The salads are amazing here. I LOVE the Caesar Salad, ask them to add some of the roasted red peppers to it to make it even more amazing.   They have great fresh bread, too.  I had the Lasagna.  I really love their red sauce.   I cannot wait to come back.  The prices are excellent or the amount and quality of food.  You MUST try this place if you like home cooked, not chain Italian food."}
{"text":"Always delicious, this is our go-to date-night spot. The staff is great, pasta is homemade heaven, and the salad included with entree is just right. It's an added treat that there is live music on Friday night. *My only wish for this place is that they would more often have plain cheese cake on the menu. We had the chef's plain cheese cake (with a little berry compote on top) the first time we went there and it was the best cheese cake I have ever had! Since then it's always been a particular flavor and it's good, but not nearly as wonderful as the plain. Some things don't need dressing up. :)"}
{"text":"Zappones is such a cute little family owned Italian restaurant. Their food is phenomenal. My favorite is the vodka penne! I attended one of their cooking classes with was such a fun time with chef sal! They make you feel like family Sal and Dina are a wonderful team. They have a really good happy hour with half off wine on Wednesday! Sal also creates deserts which are heavenly! The cheesecakes and cannolis are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the 5 star reviews. This place was average at best. Food took a very long time to come out even though the place didn't seem that busy.I had spaghetti and meatballs, my wife had chicken Parmesan, and the kids had cheese pizza. All very average, nothing was outstanding. Everything needed salt and more seasoning. Price wise, value was good."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my birthday, and I loved my meal. I thought the atmosphere was cute and casual. I ordered the mussels, and the sauce was thick and flavorful. My friend ordered the lasagna, and it was super duper cheesy and delicious. I plan to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience at lunch we had to try dinner before going back to CA.   Laura: Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo Pasta cooked perfectly and tastes fresh-made in the kitchen. Sauce creamy and delicate.  Brian: The Amatriciana This spicy red pasta has a beautiful bite and along with the pancetta, is one damn good dish.   The wait staff is amazing, especially our waitress Dina. The dining room is busy but the noise level is calming and the piped-in music must be sending subliminal signals: \"You must enjoy and relax!\"  Extra points: the music is playing Feist's \"My Moon, My Man\""}
{"text":"Chef Sal's menu has been updated for Fall 2014.  Today I had a Fried Calamari Salad and it was wonderful.  Highly recommended, it's almost a meal unto itself!"}
{"text":"A client highly recommended this place because she knows we love good  Italian food. I ordered the chicken parm and my bf ordered spaghetti and meatballs. My chicken could have been cooked a little more, just a lil pink in the middle and was disappointed to see water from the pasta sitting in my bowl of spaghetti.  My bf's spaghetti also had water on his plate from the pasta to the point he literally poured I t onto a little bread plate.  Also, if you're a coke product fan, this place serves pepsi. Aside from that,  the service was very good, ambience was nice and they had live music on a friday night. Being we live in Chandler,  if we were in the area I might give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and I'm so glad we tried it after seeing some friends check in on FB saying great things. They were right! My husband had the side Caesar salad and Chicken Parmesan and he said it was great, and I had a house side salad (delicious dressing and quality salad with cherry tomatoes, mixed greens, green olives) and Spaghetti w/ white clam sauce which was AWESOME! Tons of whole clams in the shell, delicious sauce, pasta cooked perfectly and a huge portion. We will definitely be returning to try more stuff (they had some appetizers that looked amazing) and we will absolutely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"pre pay & pre tip. I understand pre pay bistro style, but pre tip? you have to get your own drinks. Bruschetta was good, but pizza, pasta, & salads where meh. I'll give them another chance, but at least tell the servers to do more than just drop off food.  Went back after they remodeled & bar put in. The ambience is so much better & the food is good. 2 more stars!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem, a diamond in the rough no longer. I first tried out Zappone's on the day they opened as my daily commute takes me out front of the shopping center it is located in. Seeing a sign for 'Italian food coming soon' always garners my immediate attention (I'm hooked on pretty much any Italian dish). To think a nice new (locally owned) Italian restaurant would be located minutes from home, I was excited to try it out. Well, no more Superstition Spring national chain restaurants will do any longer!  The food and atmosphere here are great. Sal is a master in the kitchen along with his wife Dina. The staff has always been welcoming and accommodating. Although I don't get in as often as I'd like, they still remember your face each time you come in.   Many of our orders have been the 'take-out' variety due to a toddler at home. However, sitting down with a nice glass of wine and some great pizza always makes for an enjoyable time there. The calamari with the friend lemon was something I had not seen before but very tasty. The Chicken Pesto sandwich is very good and don't get me started on the homemade chips. Those things are straight out of a fairy tale! I'm a plain guy when it comes to the pasta, so penne and meatballs are right up my alley and the meatballs are fantastic.  I have one other favorite Italian restaurant in the East Valley (located in Tempe) but Zappone's sits right atop there with them. The bonus for me is the very convenient location to home and being along my daily work commute. Sadly, it is no longer an unknown hidden gem, but now all the better for everyone as they are truly deserving of the praise."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is incredible! You can't beat the homemade sauces & fresh pasta! My favorite is the fresh hot bread Chef Sal makes!"}
{"text":"Came for Mother's Day and Zappone's did not disappoint!  It was awesome they had a set menu for that day they were extremely busy and lucky my boys made reservations for the last seating so it was pretty laid back as the staff knew it was winding down.    The food was delicious brought my mom and she loved her prime rib dinner.  You can never go wrong with any of their pasta dishes so we all enjoyed our dinners.  You could tell our waitress was tired but she still had a great attitude never did we feel rush to leave.    Thank you Zappone's for making our Mother's Day a great experience."}
{"text":"This is the best local Italian food that I've found. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks do as they are packed most every evening. Truly the pasta sauces ante as good as what I had in Italy. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Good fairly new place. Owners were present and visible. Wait staff is attractive but very young and inexperienced. They need service training! We had the antipasto to begin-- took a very long time to come out of the kitchen but was good. We arrived at 6:03 but didn't get happy price on wine so had to pay 8$ a glass for house Pinot noir. Bread was excellent, served with oil and balsamic. We split the penne aka vodka. Still had a good amount of leftovers. Very good.  So, overall, a very nice place -- solid kitchen albeit a little slow. Prices were on the high side-- 50$ for two people exclusive of tip and we split the entree.  If they polish up the service they could have earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always amazing food and excellent service! Love this place. Super friendly and quick when I need lunch to go at work. The chicken pancetta is amazinggggg !"}
{"text":"My son and I are gluten free and they made great efforts to ensure that we could eat there when we went with my in-laws. The GF mac and cheese was amazing. I crave it!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst Mother's Day dining experience. Food was good but service was horrible. We were waited upon arriving and then our waitress basically disappeared after we placed our order. Someone else brought our food. We ran out of drinks twice during our stay. The first time we waited 10min and my wife had to track our waitress down to get refills. The 2nd time we never got refilled. This was disappointing as my wife got the $13 bottomless Bellini. They were very small glasses and she only got 2. Maybe that's their plan to make more money. We were done eating and had all our plates stacked waiting to actually look at the dessert menu. We waited 15min(at least, this is when I started timing) and no one came by. During this time my wife went up and got her own to go box. We finally even had to go up to the bar to ask for our check, this was another 10min after the last 15min I talked about. So basically done eating and getting our check 25min later. It was for my wife on Mother's Day so very dissappointed she got such horrible service."}
{"text":"I can see the owners vision with this cute little bistro.  My girlfriend and i have eaten here a few times and the overall ambience is very nice.  Here's a few observations from my meals at Zappones. 1- wine.....i NEVER drink when i go out to dinner because of the insane cost of a drink. Many times , almost as much as a meal. 7 bucks for a 1/2 a glass of wine stunned me.  I understand the science of selling alcohol but a few ounces for 7 bucks? The whole bottle might cost 5 ?  2- table bread.....not bad but needs something savory to go with the olive oil. Balsamic? Garlic spread?  3- portions.....the salads, calamari, lasagna etc were very small. This is not family style.  4- prices...a bit high for the portion size.  I just had their meatball sandwich last night which was reasonably priced (7.50)and very tastey. My girlfriend loves the lasagna as well.  1 coke, 1wine, lasagna and meatball sandwich-- with tip 35.00  Cute place, small portions, not cheap, tastey food"}
{"text":"Awesome service! The food is made fresh and carefully crafted! Chef sal is a huge inspiration and makes amazing food! Love the pizzas! They are a must to try! The eggplant rollatini and the lasagna are a favorite as well! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"The other night, my mom was in the mood for Italian food, specifically fettuccine alfredo. After looking through Yelp to find options nearby, we settled on Zappones.   Definitely impressed with their level of customer service. As a mom of a toddler, I know it can be a little challenging to eat out, so I usually come prepared with lots of things to keep my little one busy during the meal. What I love is that they give you an entire box of crayons with the kids coloring menu. My daughter had a blast using every color in the box to create her masterpiece.   Everyone was super friendly, numerous people stopped by our table to check in on us and ask how everything was.   The food was... Average. Nothing to write home about, but not a terrible experience either. I just found it to be a little bland. I ended up only eating two ravioli from my entire plate because I just couldn't stomach the calories if I didn't love it.  The manager was very gracious, when she thought that they had not finished my meal, or rather, barely touched it, she took it off the bill for me.  Again, amazing customer service. I may try to return again in the near future to give this place another chance, based solely on the Customer Service alone."}
{"text":"Read reviews and decided try it. We found the bruschetta sauce flavored well. They were good size for two and hearty. The homemade fresh bread was tasty. Had it been warmed it would have been even better. My Cesar salad was good. The house salad was a little too drenched in the vinegar estate. For the main dishes we ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the penne ala vodka. The sauce was great on the penne and the homemade meatballs err moist and seasoned well. The sauce was sweet and not too acidic or thick. My gripe is if your going to have homemade sauce and meatballs your pasta should be homemade also and I could tell it wasn't.  The service was good quality. We were seated right away and did not have to wait for anything."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing!  We were in a hurry and they were so accommodating. Can't wait to go back so we can really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Fabulous Monday might spaghetti and meatballs!  Good Chopped Italian salad too.  Place was busy but we were served in a timely manner and our server was very efficient."}
{"text":"Was looking for some Italian this evening and found just the right place! Libby was our very attentive server who was fantastic. The food was beyond words. All of the items were made in house and you could tell great care went into the food. Hands down, this is where I will be going for my fix of some amazing food. I can't wait to bring friends, this will be a new regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. I love that they put green olives on our pizza instead of black ones. They are always so kind and quick to make modifications if you ask.  The chips are so stinkin good too. I have yet to try something there that I didn't love. This will forever been my favorite local pizza place."}
{"text":"The calamari is the best I've tasted with a hint of fresh garlic. The service is good-servers are friendly. The food is fresh and tasty. Feels like a good home made meals!"}
{"text":"Wow. The absolute BEST fettuccine Alfredo I have ever had in my life. And I have been all over Italy! Every bite of this dish melted in my mouth. Best Italian food in this country, can't believe it's in my backyard here in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great neighborhood Italian place. Seafood Fettuccine, Mushroom Fettuccini, and Fritto Misto were all fantastic."}
{"text":"We just ate there for the first time and everything was very enjoyable. The service was excellent too. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food absolutely fantastic.  This is our new go to restaurant! We had come in a couple weeks ago for a catering tasting and Dina and Sam did a fabulous job on creating a menu for our venue.  Said we would return for a meal and we were not disappointed!  Best Italian cuisine around."}
{"text":"Food fell very short of traditional Italian. Food was bland and tasteless. Heard yelling and profanity from the kitchen. Thought my server was new from her inexperience come to find out she'd been there close to the time of restaurant opening. Will not return."}
{"text":"Came in with a coupon for a dinner salad, 1 topping large pizza, chicken riggatoni alfredo, and a slice of pumpkin marscapone cheesecake for $30.  Great coupon deal!  Salad was good.  Pizza was delicious with prosciutto on it, and the alfredo sauce was really good.  The pumpkin cheesecake was amazing, and according to the little sign on the table the whole cake goes for $36. I think it was better than cheesecake factory pumpkin cheesecake, and they charge an arm and a leg for those!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came for Valentine's Dinner and really enjoyed our dinner. Although it was a limited menu, the dinner was delicious and the service was great. We will come back for the shrimp pasta and cheesecake."}
{"text":"This restaurant is somewhat of a hidden gem! First time coming here, and I was greatly pleased. We came for lunch, which has a limited menu than the dinner menu. However, the selections provided enough of a variety that everyone could get what they truly wanted. The sever was very pleasant and worked hard, as I noticed she was the only one on the floor at the time we were there. I recommend the penne a la vodka with shrimp! My husband and I definitely will come back here for date night!"}
{"text":"I would absolutely recommend this little restaurant. It is tucked away in a little strip mall, but that doesn't stop the food from being outstanding.   The Good:  The pasta is freshly made and absolutely excellent. I got the shrimp scampi and my husband got the lobster diavolo. There was a ton of shrimp in my dish with a lot of flavor. My husband's dish had an entire small lobster in it. The sauce was flavorful and spicy, but not so spicy that you have a hard time eating the dish. It was the perfect balance against the sweetness of the lobster. We were really impressed with the flavor and the amount of seafood we got.  The Not So Good:  The calamari appetizer is a little lacking in quantity. It was ok for the two of us, but if we had been there with one or two other people there would not have been enough for more than a few bites each. There was A TON of dipping sauce, though, but the creamier sauce was way too salty. The calamari itself was pretty good, but nothing special. The entrees more than make up for the calamari deficiencies, though."}
{"text":"\"Homemade\" ravioli was made in a factory and shipped frozen. The brand name must be Homemade, because there was nothing fresh about it. Mine was served ice cold with lukewarm \"meat\" sauce. When complaining, I was told \"well, that's how it is\" so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just came for lunch for the first time. Had a couple of four peaks while waiting for my lunch. I was not expecting what came to my table.. Wow.. I ordered braised beef sliders... My goodness amazing and I don't know how to describe it... I know food and work in the food industry for over 20 yrs... My lunch was amazing... You should try the Zappones at least once. I am coming back to try dinner now. Owners are amazing and friendly. Check them out and when you do please yelp . Thanks"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations, which we ultimately took. My raspberry Smash cocktail was amazing. The lobster mac was perfectly seasoned, with large pieces of lobster and the most delicious, rich sauce. Definitely will be back on my next trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"Just got done with an early dinner. We had a coupon that gave us an appetizer and dinner for 20 buck.  This place is fairly new. We were the only ones in e place at 3:30 in the afternoon.   The food was very good. They know how to make real Italian dishes. The place it tucked back in a strip mall so I don't think they get much drive through traffic.  Anyway, it a hidden gem. You need to try it."}
{"text":"we have been looking for a good authentic Italian  restaurant in the east valley, This was not it.  Bread and Salad were good but then main course was a different story.  My wife and I both ordered spaghetti and meatballs the Monday night special.   First we only got one meatball even tho the menu says meatballs (pl) then the pasta it was boxed spaghetti you would get at the grocery store.   no respectable Italian restaurant would server boxed pasta. i was expecting a fresh pasta not something that is 50 cents a pound at the store.  Very disappointed  with this dinning experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy! We had fried ravioli appetizers.  I had the eggplant parmesean and my husband had baked rigatoni.  Great meal but a little pricey."}
{"text":"So Thursday's special was 50% off pizza so I went all in. I ordered the \"Popeye\" and added prosciutto. Boy was it yummy. The crust was perfect and I am picky about my pizza crusts!  Really enjoyed it and got to bring half home for lunch the next day!    My husband ordered the lasagna with a meatball on the side. \"That's a good meatball\" exclaimed my husband after the first bite. The lasagna is made with homemade noodles and comes cheesy delicious. Needless to say, his plate was clean at the end.   And how can you ever come to an Italian restaurant and not try the desserts?  My favorite all time is the cannoli so they had me before we ordered dinner! The shell was fresh and crisp and the filling was light and delicious...and dipped in pistachios!  Amazing!!!  We will definitely come back because I hear I have to try the homemade cheesecake!    Twist my arm!!"}
{"text":"Decided I'd try a longtime bookmark while \"in the area.\"  (It took me 27 minutes to drive from Tempe's SWIHA to Gilbert's Rise Up Bakery, and then another four minutes to Zappone's.)  I'm so glad I did!  I was promptly greeted at the door, and I inquired if I had to sit at the bar to enjoy the happy hour menu, or would I be able to sit anywhere, and the greeter said I could sit anywhere.  I almost sat at the bar, but it's such as small space (five or six high bar chairs), and I didn't want to sit with my back to the front entrance, so I chose to sit at a red leather-backed booth/four-top.  Slightly dark indoors, but not too dark to drive me away.  I eat with my eyes as well as my mouth, y'know.  Happy hour menu features a $1 off house cocktails, $4 glasses of house wines, $4 well drinks, $3 drafts, 15% off wine bottles, a few $5 apps, a $5 Caesar salad, and a $3 bowl of \"warm olives.\"  A shout-out to server Caressa, who made me feel so welcome; She was friendly, patient, and understanding in regards to my questions regarding food allergies.  No negative vibes here!  She also took my requests to sample three wines (a house red, a house white, and Cannon Ball Chardonnay-- I went with the $8 glass of Chardonnay). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=XVYmbangVxnZOzyg1iEY7A  Because of the terrific customer service shown to me, I decided I'd go with three courses:  Jake's Mac-n-Cheese, $5. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=vLtofR0wyZ6f_C4IiaCf8QLoved this dish featuring alfredo, mozzarella on penne and topped with pancetta!  Smoky and cheesy, and a lovely bite/chew from the penne, and a great value! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=s7n3g1f5GGZen1IDEA1gBA  Sausage & Onion Pizza, $5. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=Ab8QiySsWeWb65xnsbcuWwSo what if it looked like it might be soggy from the marinara sauce and its crust a bit thicker than I'd like it to be?  It had Italian sausage (from Chicago) on it- it had to be good!  And it was!  Enjoyed a small slice of the eight-inch pizza and had the rest boxed, for I was about to enjoy the second course... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=DVDNPddHFaJZwbvSG8PsHw  Fettuccine Alfredo, with chicken, $16. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=c1-3ilR_MHMxirPZJu8Z0AI chose this entree, because it was one of two pasta entrees that did not include marinara** as an ingredient, it also featured one of the two pasta varieties made in-house!  (The other is ravioli.)  The sauce was silky smooth (no clumps!) and just salty enough to make me reach for \"just one more\" forkful.  Didn't feel greasy, either.  One of the best Alfredos I've had, and I'd definitely order it again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=Ra4JlgX22HJRwTNnxLEPXw  I could've ended the meal there- I certainly ate more than I wanted, but the cheesecake was calling my name...   Mascarpone cheesecake, with blueberry compote, $6. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=MfPbCAC7dtAvz-eaVGtz7gThe desserts are made in-house, with the exception of the gelato and sorbettos, which come from Italy.  Couldn't try the sfogliatelle and cannoli due to the powdered sugar content, so cheesecake it had to be, and I was THRILLED!  It was beautiful to look at, fun to photograph, and very delightful to eat.  It had this golden-brown top layer that was so gratifying to cut through with a fork, and perfect-to-me center that was neither too firm, nor too whipped, and a not-very-sweet graham cracker crust.  The blueberry topping was exquisite!  I cannot gush about this sweet concoction enough!  I contemplated on taking a whole cheesecake home ($36) and appeased myself by planning on ordering one for Christmas, should Mom and I get an invitation to lunch/dinner.  While the holiday catering menu only listed Peppermint chocolate cheesecake as the only dessert option, Carissa told me I could ask for any flavor I wanted.  I quite fancied the one I tried tonight! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=1RuD3bxX6bS1FVpfTs3TAw  Miscela d'Oro Americano, $2.50, with $0.50 refills. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=jghr9T7Vkuc_crNbYO4bAw  Feast of the Seven Fishes menu, Dec. 9th, 6pm, $50 all-inclusive!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=vT6GnHLad0qXRDnqLBIudg Holiday Pre-sale menu! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=DuFrbCx-KnD7ROUxpK4Qfg  FYI, Zappone's also offers weekly dine-in specials!  $6 Spaghetti & meatballs with house salad on Mondays and Tuesdays; 50% off all wine bottles, all day Wednesdays; and Buy one pizza and get 50% off second pizza all day Thursdays."}
{"text":"It's always a treat to eat at ZAPPONE'S!!!  The staff is so friendly and efficient ... the ambiance delightful ... and the service and food is exceptional.  Last Saturday night our server was Baylee; she was delightful, attentive and informative and went above and beyond to take care of our party of four.  I have eaten several delicious entrees at ZAPPONE'S; but the Shrimp Creamy Pesto with rigatoni, artichokes and red peppers I had Saturday ranks near the top of my favorites!"}
{"text":"We went to Zappone's with high expectations, a friend of mine raved about this place.   DH ordered the lasagna, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.. dinner came with salad no soup.. that was a let down.. The salad a pile of spring greens (weeds) with a splash of a marinated red pepper on top. I am not a fan of the bagged greens I prefer romaine lettuce. The salad came with an oil dressing which was pleasant tasting.  Ordered a glass of house red ( $7.50 ) pricey but good  Dinner arrived, my spaghetti $9.50 was served with a runny tomato sauce that was very salty, tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes, on top of my pasta was two meat balls that were cold and clearly just placed there..  Husbands lasagna $12.50 , was also a soupy mess lots of cheese not much else   Servings were not what I would call generous, which doesnt bother me if food is edible.   We left without eating the dinner, we offered to pay for the wine which was best part of the dinner service..  Waitress comped the wine. I do not understand all the rave reviews I have to agree with the others who left 3 or less stars.  I Think  Robert Irvine would agree this food was horrible"}
{"text":"Zappone's offers $5 customer appreciation lunches once a month. How cool is that!? The restaurant was packed when we came here on Tuesday, but we were seated promptly and our orders were taken on a fairly quick amount of time.  I chose the chicken caprese sandwich, which came with your choice of salad or chips (Caesar salad for me). The bread with the sandwich was superb. The outer crispy crust contrasted well with the moist, soft texture of the bread. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the basil/mozzarella combination was excellent. The salad was crisp and refreshing. It was quite a lot of food for $5!  Service was good despite the large number of patrons. Drinks were refilled as needed and the owner and staff were very friendly.  I believe the lunch special runs on the first Tuesday of the month. I'll definitely be back to try more of their dishes on other days though!"}
{"text":"Zappone's catering is a first class experience!!! My family event of 100 people would not have been the same without Zappone's. Our guests are still raving about how amazing and authentic their food was, and also how kind and hospitable their staff was for our event. It was first class service through and through. We can't wait to go back and have dinner at the restaurant! You will not be disappointed using Zappone's catering. Dina was incredible with all of the details and no one skipped a beat from the beginning to end. Great owners, great staff, and great food!! My family and I can't thank you enough for helping us put on such a memorable event!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out for a while, and It didn't disappoint.  Upon being seated, we were told they have a $5.99 Spaghetti & meatball with house salad special on Monday and Tuesday nights.  We tried that, and it was good.  Bread was also served. And, we tried a flight of 3 wines for $7.00.   Bill total was under $23.00 (also had iced tea) before tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We will be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"YUM! Our first time here today and it blew us away. The homemade ravioli is out of this world and there is really nothing like fresh pasta! And those MEATBALLS! We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Italian. So good. Very authentic and fresh. Good wine, good food and live music tonight. Yeah! This is a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"On our last full day here in AZ, my boyfriend and I had lunch here with my mom and my sister. I got the mussels arribiatta and the first thing I noticed was that the pasta tasted fresh, not something from the box. Delicious. I tried some of my mom's chicken parm sandwich and again, the freshness of the food really shown through. Portions were a good size all around and priced very reasonably. We left full and satisfied. Next time, I'm getting that chicken parm sandwich!"}
{"text":"Had a solid dinner here, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Their pizza is tasty and prepared well, with generous toppings and a nice thin crisp. The Italian sampler, fried gnocchi, salad and bread were all very tasty. However, I'm more than a bit peeved at their menu- online they have a lot of good offerings that aren't represented on the menu. I understand that veal probably wasn't a huge seller for them, but I love it, and I was excited to try some when I got there. I noticed that it wasn't on their menu, so when I asked the server, she said that they had taken it off. Their website needs to be updated to reflect that, unless they plan to bring it back... in which case I'd definitely come back.  The restaurant itself is cozy and friendly, and seems like it would be a nice place to come split a bottle of wine with a loved one. However, with the draconian policies of Arizona police regarding Tent City, I won't be partaking of that particular treat. However if you're staying at a nearby hotel, this would be a great place to come try!"}
{"text":"Coming out of review hibernation to sing the praises of Zappone's. Fiance & I have been here at least 6 times in the past handful of months... I've ordered a variety of things off their menu and have NEVER been disappointed. And I'm a little picky about my Italian food.   None of their sauces are too sweet (I have a major beef with sugared down sauce)... lasagna, ravioli, gnocchi, tortelloni... all amazing!  And for those cannoli purists out there, yes, their cannoli are made with ricotta and not cream. I know that was a big selling point for my mom. ;)  To those older reviews who complained about having to pre-pay & pre-tip, this is no longer a thing at Zappone's.  Servers are super friendly and amazing. I always enjoy my visits here."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service.  Erin was attentive and very helpful.  The bruschetta trio was wonderful and each of us ordered something different and really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I did our monthly dinner at Zappone's on the 11th. Neither of us ever been there before so we crossed our fingers hoping it would be good. The restaurant is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Walked in and was surprised.  With being a small establishment, the tables are small as well so that's another drawback.  Service was kind of slow considering it was a Friday. After placing the dinner order, it took a good 30-35 minutes to get the food. Could of been longer. All I know is I was hungry lol. The appetizer bread was good and soft, but the olive oil & balsamic vinegar concoction that came with it had too much balsamic so that was a no. I had the chicken saltimbocca and I really liked it. It was seasoned well with a good flavor."}
{"text":"Dueling pianos (electric keyboards)! I don't know how often they do it but it is essential to try it at least once. Food and drinks were  very inexpensive and they give you the right size portion. The crowd is mostly 70 and up which was my favorite part, they know the words to every song from the 30s to the 70s.   I live in Cali so I can't say I will come back, but if they had something like this in Cali I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch with friends. Most of us had the chicken calabrese sandwich--delish. Very hearty and the house made chips were good though one or two of them were soggy. Service was very attentive but not intrusive. I wish they had a round table--much better for 6 people to be able to talk."}
{"text":"This is one of the prospective places my brother and his fiance are looking to cater their wedding. Coming from a big italian family, my parents stressed to him that he needed to have good food at the wedding. As I am visiting him, they took me here to try the food and give my NY verdict.   We started with the fried gnocchi, which were a pleasant surprise. The shell of it almost had an egg roll crunch to it, and inside, I have no idea what was inside of it, but it was delicious. Inside the gnocchi must've been a mix of cheese and a light sauce. Very yummy, and would be a big hit if it made its rounds at the wedding. I ordered the caesar salad as a side, the dressing was a bit watery but tasted well.  I ordered the pasta amatriciana. While it was a good dish there were some elements of it that just needed some fixing for me. The onions stood out, they just didn't feel like they belonged. Perhaps if they were caramelized instead it would gel better. Also, the dish needed more pancetta. The pancetta will sweeten the sauce more and bring out the flavors instead of them all meshing in.  For dessert we had the italian sampler platter. It consists of cannoli, panna cotta, and cheesecake. The cannoli were great, the pistachio crumbs really gave the cream a nice nutty flavor. The panna cotta was good as well, the first time I ever had panna cotta was in italy, so I have pretty high standards for it. This panna cotta stands up well to it. It wasn't as thick and it wasn't as creamy, but the taste was there for it. The cheesecake was delicious as well. My brother said this wasn't the cheesecake they had sampled that would be apart of the wedding selection, but it still would've been a good choice. (The one for the wedding would've been the marscapone one).   I think if my brother and his fiance chose this caterer for the wedding my family would be happy, and I know my brother and his fiance are happy with it so it would be a great win-win."}
{"text":"Food was good! I'd say a little above average but great flavors. Went on a Saturday night and they were packed. They offered house bread while waiting.  The food was good quality but I'm only giving a 3 star since it was expensive. Basic Fettuccine Alfredo was $13.00, +$4.00 for shrimp."}
{"text":"I'm not quire sure why all the 4 stars.  I mean, the food was average.  Good, but not that memorable.  My husband and I shared the toasted ravioli and calamari - both were cooked perfectly.  But what took it from wonderful to mediocre was the tomato sauce.  Both appetizers came with the same sauce that might as well have been out of a can.  In fact, the first thing my husband said about the ravioli was, \"It reminds me of Chef Boyardee.\"  Indeed.  We then shared the chicken pasta with pesto sauce, and it was just a little too salty for me.  Although I have to say that the pesto sauce was much more exciting than the tomato sauce.  The chicken was cooked well and was not dry.  As other reviewers mentioned, the portions are a little on the small side.  The service was friendly and attentive, and if I could, I'd give this place 4 stars.  But because I feel like I could have had this same food anywhere else, it just doesn't quite get there for me."}
{"text":"Truly amazing!!! Jakes Mac and cheese, penne alavodka, lasagna, pizza, bread absolutely amazing! Don't even get me started on the desserts. The cheesecake was heaven!! The owners are so lovely and you can tell they love what they do!! We will be back regularly!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great Italian food!  We are so happy to have found this place.     The mussels in white sauce are awesome.  The bottle of Capezzana (Red blend) was a great suggestion for our meal.    We felt right at home thanks to the owner  and servers and we will be back soon to sample the other menu options."}
{"text":"I ordered the special of the night which was a lobster shrimp fettuccine with a basil cream sauce. It was so good I literally high fived myself. The lobster pieces were generous and succulent. The shrimp was tender and also plentiful. The pasta was the perfect vehicle for mixing the cram sauce and fresh basil into every mouthful. Usually a very good dish will make me eat it so fast that I don't give myself a chance to taste it properly. But the completely arresting yet subtle flavors forced me to take only a modest mouthful each time so that I could properly savor the warm buttery richness of the lobster. I was at the mercy of the meal. And I joyfully submitted to its magnificence. I closed my eyes with every mouthful and for a moment I forgot where I was and who I was. But I'm back now and I will return.  Tina was a fabulous server. She does not allow any mistakes and her recommendations are spot on."}
{"text":"Saw the Chef on Channel 3 and everything he prepared for them looked amazing and so fresh.  I was very excited to try it.     The service was great, we were seated quickly, our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered an appetizer - the fried gnocchi.  Great!  Crispy on the outside and cheesy gooey on the inside.  The caesar salads were ok, nothing special.    My husband ordered the veal manicotti and I ordered the eggplant rollatini.  The manicotti filling was a little under-seasoned so it was just ok.  The eggplant however, tasted like the freezer.  Weird.  Why would they freeze eggplant?  I thought it didn't make sense so it must just be me.  I ate the filling out of it and pushed the weird tasting eggplant to the side.  Then we decided to split the desert sampler.  The Sfogliatelle was DELICIOUS!  But the Rum Baba had that same gross freezer taste again.  I asked the waitress and she confirmed that the desserts do come in frozen...blech.  Don't waste your time on that one - (unless it is for the visuals because lets just say - it's a great looking dessert for a bachelorette party).    I don't get all the 5 star reviews for this place.  We must've ordered the wrong things.  After tax and tip we left $100 lighter and I really don't feel like it was worth it."}
{"text":"1st let me open with this: I had high hopes for this pizza after reading the reviews. It was ready promptly which kept those hopes alive. But alas, those hopes were quickly dashed after the first bite. Let me follow that opening with this closer: I ordered the pie for my wife and I in an effort to avoid the pain, sorrow and agony of eating the cafeteria food at the hospital where we were after the birth of our child. After the 1st bite though I realized that I had these food items situationally reversed and began eating the cafeteria food...with vigor. I am not sure I can say much more than that. When given the choice between a cold quesadilla and this pizza there were only 2 viable options: eat the cold cafeteria quesadilla or throw away the pizza and eat the box. I went with option 1 as the box had some of the pizza sauce on it and wasn't made from recycled material."}
{"text":"Went for a Valentines day lunch! So glad I did. It really is a hidden gem. My husband got the chicken marsala and says he will get it again the next time we come. I got the casa salad which was so good. But their bread and desserts can't be beat. We had a hazelnut gelato. So many good quality options!"}
{"text":"If you want to be discriminated against, this is the restaurant for you. I have been to thousands and thousands of restaurants in my life, everything from Dives to high scale, high-class, six star restaurants where you have to dress to the nines to even get in the door. I have never ever once been treated as shitty as I did last night at this restaurant. And I mean never. I cannot say that enough. I had the worst experience here last night that I have ever had in my entire life at any restaurant. And I am not exaggerating. I am so mad and so upset and hurt by the treatment that we received last night. My boyfriend and I just moved here to Gilbert from California to help my sister because she is very sick. We took my sister to this restaurant, because she was raving about it. Well, I don't know what the Rave was about, and after our experience, none of us, not even my sister, will ever return. We timed everything. It took exactly 26 minutes for a waitress to approach our table for anything.She approached her table 26 minutes after we sat down. That is beyond inexcusable. She and another waitress walked by our table so many effing times before we even got any service. And the manager, in the burgundy shirt, the joke of a manager that she is, also walked by our table 9 times at least, and did not take one look at us. I think the manager pissed me off more than the waitress, if that's even possible. We quickly learned by watching her and the waitresses interactions with all of the other guests, that if you're not a regular here, you get ignored and treated like shit. You get shitty shitty service unless you're a regular. If you're a regular, they wait on you hand and foot. Every other table, and I'm not exaggerating, every other table except for ours, had both waitresses and the manager waiting on them hand and foot, all night long. And if you were drinking wine, that was an even bigger plus. The manager was flipping out over the people drinking wine for some reason. I don't know what the deal is with that, but she couldn't get enough of the people that were drinking wine. She was constantly refilling their glasses with wine. The manager also came around all night long with a pitcher of ice water and filled everybody's glass of water except for ours! No joke. She walked by our table all night long, and never even glanced our way. Speaking of which, it took our waitress 18 minutes after ordering our drinks before we even got our drinks brought to us. The only reason we got our drinks brought to us at all is because I had to ask 2 different Busboys to go get our drinks. That was like I said, 18 minutes after we ordered drinks. Then we ordered garlic bread, that tasted like shit. It was very doughy and not good at all. Then they brought us Caesar salads, which tasted like it was right out of a bag! It was disgusting. We had to ask for everything from other people. Our waitress never brought one single thing that we ordered. We had to ask Busboys to get our stuff for us all night long. My glass of ice tea was sitting there empty, for 26 minutes. I timed everything as you can tell. I had to ask 3 times for my iced tea refilled in that 26 minutes before I even got it. We had to then wait another 12 minutes for dessert, and another 13 minutes after that for our check. I just cannot stress enough how utterly shocked and in disbelief I was over the treatment that every other table got. People ranging from young to old, getting treated like absolute royalty! Absolute Royalty. Two waitresses and a manager waiting on them hand and foot all night long!  the men sitting next to us, you would think that they were celebrities for god sakes. I cannot believe how well they got treated. The manager was at their table all night long chatting it up with them, offering them this that and the other, offering them coupons and discounts, I just could not believe my eyes. That manager is absolutely disgusting. I can't even believe that she freaking works there. She should definitely not be a manager. This place is an effing effing joke and I will share my experience EVERYWHERE so that EVERYONE in Arizona knows about this place!!!!  you guys are absolutely pathetic and you should not be in business, that is how bad you guys treated us last night!!! One last thing to think about..... How do you expect one to become a regular, when you don't give them a chance to come back?"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time over the weekend. The food was delicious!  The staff was friendly ans accommodating. We truly enjoyed the live music! I had the chicken Marsala and my husband had chicken Parmesan. We also had calamari and the spumoni for dessert!  Overall wonderful experience and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just had date night with the hubby here, we've been wanting to try it because it's so close to home.    It's cute inside when you walk in. Doesn't hold a lot of people, and for a strip mall it's cute.   Ordered bruschetta trio- to be honest I hated the fig jam and prosciutto one. Yuck. The ricotta cheese and red bell pepper was ok, a little flavorless. But the caprese one was fantastic! The bread for the bruschetta was really yummy.   Had the corleone pizza- I really liked the crust and sauce but I felt like the cheese was a little cheap and the grease was abundant.   I will definitely come back and order pasta and a salad next time. It is way better than Salernos up the street."}
{"text":"We just came from having the BEST pizza we have ever eaten.  We had the Sicilian and added artichokes.  Unbelievably delicious, Artisan style and fresh.  It was wonderful.  The owner/cook and entire staff made their way over to our table just to greet us.  They sell homemade french bread and rosemary/kalamata olive french bread.  Took two loaves home.  Don't listen to one word negative about the restaurant, service or food.  It really was delightful.   fyi:  to Lenne O from Denver...  You must have been in the pizza restaurant across the parking lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2) there isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip.  None of that..."}
{"text":"I'm a little late writing this review but I had to share how wonderful Zappone's is! My mom and stepfather were visiting me from upstate NY (where I grew up!) Let's just say we know Italian food!   We went early on a week night and were immediately greeted by the hostess, who I believe is the owner. I ordered a delicious  Limoncello Sangria and truffle parmesan chips to start. I will eat anything with truffle oil on it! These were out of this world! They were home made chips that we're so tasty.  For entrees I ordered the wild mushroom fettuccine with you gussed it, truffle oil! My parents each had the special of spaghetti and meatballs. It was ridiculously cheap and a huge portion for like $6.   My mom said it reminded her of my great grandmother's sauce when she was a child. My great grandmother was from Italy, so that is a huge compliment. We all agreed it's better than any Italian food we ever had in NY!  For dessert I had canollis!! You can rarely find decent ones in Phoenix so I was pleasantly surprised to see them on the menu.   A few days later my stepfather stopped in for a pizza while my mom and I were out shopping. I had a leftover slice and it's definitely the NY pizza I miss being in AZ.   You won't be disappointed if you stop by and it's so nice to support a locally owned family business! I can't wait to bring my husband to try it out on date night."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday (3-30-13) with my wife. Started out with an appetizer of Bruschetta then main course. Bruschetta was excellent, was six half slices of bread with 3 different types of Bruschetta. I had the Chicken Piccata  and my wife had the Gnocchi.  My Piccata was excellent,chicken over spinach and capers with a white sauce and plate of pasta on the side. The Gnocchi came with a tomato meat sauce (over or on the side) very good also. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. Oh yes. the waitstaff  was among the most friendly I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and fresh food (especially the salads) but it took a very, very long time to get food. Like 40+ minutes for a medium pizza and a bowl of rigatoni..and it was a Wednesday night and the restaurant was half full, so I'm not sure what the hold up was.   The arugula,  pear, and prosciutto salad was great but the lemon vinaigrette was too acidic. Pizza is good but the crust was very chewy. Overall quality of ingredients was very good."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. I always get my food to go. After work or on my way to work. I have tried a majority of the pasta dishes all 5 stars. The pizza I would give a 3. The salads are fresh and taste fresh.  I recommend this place to all my neighbors and friends. Everyone tells me how thankful they are I did. Every time I come in they are dead. More people need to know about this place!! It's the best. I know if more people knew how great it was and found them when they were looking it would boom!   The service is always good to! Love love love this place! It deserves to have more traffic."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food in the Valley! My husband had the wild mushroom with beef and I had the cheese tortellini with peas and pancetta, both were amazing!Excellent service and very friendly staff as well, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I only come to Arizona once a year for work, but Zappone's is always on my \"must\" list. The staff really know their wine list and make excellent recommendations. They also give off a very friendly and warm vibe. The service has always been on point.  The food is exceptional. The pasta is always cooked perfectly, and the sauces are the right combination of flavor, richness, texture, and in the right quantity. I had a mushroom fettuccine dish at the server's recommendation, and it was an excellent call. I also tried the tiramisu at the chef's recommendation (who came out to the table to greet our small group), which had a lovely decadent flavor and texture. It was a well-balanced finisher for the meal.  The only downside is that this place is a state away from me! I'm definitely looking forward to returning next year."}
{"text":"The pizza is outstanding!  I usually eat 2, sometime 3 slices of a large pizza, today I had 5! I couldn't stop eating it.  Wonderful sauce & cheese, the crust is thin and slightly crisp, cooked to perfection.  The only down side for us was the pasta red sauce was slightly too sweet and almost every menu item had ham in it, I'm not a ham fan. but that's just me.  The place is clean and decorated very nicely, the owners are supper nice and service is top notch (even though you order at the counter, they take care of you after that).  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New find for my wife and I. We recently travelled to Italy. This place is the closest food and experience we found in Italy!  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time to eat at this restaurant. We came in late, and they appeared to be closing up, we asked if we could be seated even though it was late, and they were very friendly and welcoming. I was surprised at the speed of the service. The food was extremely delicious. The Spaghetti and meatballs, although a simple dish was very very good. I had the chicken piccata, and the pasta served alongside it was amazing. My sister had the meatball sandwich, and I ended up eating half of her meal. I could not believe how good it was.   This restaurant is a rare treat, in a plain strip mall. I hope they stay busy and I hope they never close."}
{"text":"Came out to lunch with my daughter an fiancée found this place on yelp so thought we would try it out. We had a pepperoni pizza a cheese pizza an a pasta with rose an red wine was unbelievably good an tried the Cannolis  very good the people there are so friendly an we will defiantly be going back again for date night"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new Italian place and he found this one online.  We are sure glad we decided to check it out.  Not only was the food amazing, but so was the service.  We went in about 5 PM on a Saturday, so well before the dinner rush because we wanted to check out the happy hour.  We had drinks, an appetizer, salad, main course, after dinner drinks and dessert.  Each course was timed perfectly.  Our glasses were never empty, and the food....well it was amazing!  Fresh made bread was wonderful, they make their own mozzarella in house and even some of their pasta is made there.  Try the Cheesecake!  We will for sure be back and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best Italian I've ever had! Nothing I've eaten in Rome, Florence or Venice was better. Every morsel is delectable. Good size portions. Perfectly prepared and nicely presented. You will not be disappointed! Even the bread and croutons are delicious."}
{"text":"We had prosciutto arugula salad and old Chicago pizza. The salad was very bland and the pizza was oozing oily giardiniera. It was an expensive unsatisfying dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The staff are great and the food is even better.  Shrimp linguine in rosé sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"First of all, it was way too loud in here.  We ordered a pizza and asked for \"light/easy cheese.\"  When we got the pizza it was as if they went heavy with the cheese.  There was so much cheese on the pizza we peeled it off and there was at least 1/2 cup of cheese on each slice.  Way too much cheese!!!!!!  Not to mention it was so greasy you could have poured the grease off of each slice.  The crust was the best part.  Also, the price was good...not overpriced."}
{"text":"Wow, all these people giving 5 stars? This place is just ok.    Promising: half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  Server recommended the Malbec, which I enjoyed and took home the rest of the bottle.  Fried ravioli app: tasty but nothing special. Marinara was decent.  Caesar salad. Yep, I agree with other reviewers.  Tasteless. Desperately needs anchovies.  Bread: Very fresh, but again, agree with other reviewers, olive oil dip is worthless. Maybe a little more balsamic?  Dipping it in the marinara was definitely the way to go.  Ameriabiatta(?) With sausage: tasty sauce but lacking in meat.  Penne ala vodka with chicken: a bit lacking in flavor and sauce. Chicken was those little frozen chicken chunks from Costco. Wtf? The owner lady stopped by so we asked how it was cooked. She says it's caramelized in the pizza oven. Uh, what? Chicken doesn't caramelize.  I think maybe it was thawed in the pizza oven.  I definitely could have made this dish better myself.  Service: no complaints. Server was helpful and attentive.   Overall:  Glad I had a $10 for $20 living social coupon, otherwise would've been very overpriced for an okay but not awe inspiring meal.  Menu is limited, ingredients aren't high quality.  Next time I want Italian I'll go to Baci's Italian bistro. See my other review for true awesomeness."}
{"text":"Been here 2x now! Absolutely my NEW FAVORITE italian reasturant!! I love how fresh everything is!!!! Excellent Customer Service! My only complaint would be that both times ive ordered the Alfredo Cheese Tortellini and they were out of tortellini which was a bummer especially 2 different times.. they did substitute with Cheese Ravioli but i would think if they run out of a certain dish so fast and often they would place a bigger order for it, but overall the dish was still fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff.  I cam here late, and they were very accommodating.  The food was good and pretty reasonably priced.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have since been back 3 times and I don't understand why they can't make a decent pizza.  I do not like pizza's that come out soggy in the middle.  I have now ordered it twice and both times I asked for well done and it came out soggy.  On a positive note the 5.99 spaghetti and a meatball is super value for lunch or even at dinner on Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"Update to review:  Went in last night with a party of 7 to include an out of town guest and an elderly grandmother. That's when we realized the place is really set up well for large groups. We could have had 25 people in the group and it would have worked.    There were two hiccups with the food. Nothing major, just a slight delay on two dishes. We didn't complain at all. This is more of an \"Artisan\" type restaurant where the meals are hand crafted vs. Assembly line that you would get elsewhere so there has to be a little trade-off. If a chef has to make a number of different dishes, things are bound to not run smoothly.  Even though we didn't care, they still apologized SINCERELY each time they updated us, delivered the food and then checked on the food. They really care. Much to our surprise, the owner took items off of the bill for the inconvenience. THIS PLACE CARES.  Excellent management, staff, ownership and attitude. Please dine here when you can. Even if you're a little let down they make it up a lot.  First review: This place is amazing. If you're looking for authentic and absolutely delicious Italian fare, come to this place.  It's in a strip mall setting so you don't have to worry about parking. Inside, the seating is plentiful. I normally hate sitting at two-tops or non-booth tables but I wouldn't mind it here. It's laid out very well.  The owner, Dina, was very friendly. Her husband is the chef and he is AMAZING. The server was also really sweet. She was able to describe the food selection very well. When asked about the choice of two different wines, she admitted she wasn't going to fake expertise and insisted on asking for the best answer from I guess the owner or chef. She did right by us.  The mussels were awesome. The sauce was delicious. We also had the bruschetta trio and it blew away Postino's bruschetta and we really love their fare. The entrees were great. We had chicken with pancetta and vegetables and also had their homemade fettuccine with braised beef and mushrooms. Really delicious food. This isn't some kind of hit or miss restaurant. They make their cheesecake in the most amazing fashion.  For the quality of food and desert and service, the pricing was well worth it. We will definitely be back.  Thank you Dina and staff for an absolutely great edperienc"}
{"text":"Simple yet great Italian food. Eat here a few times a month for lunch. GREAT lunch special and everything is fresh. Just tastes great. Owners are great people and enjoy what they are doing. Been there twice for diner. Always a great meal. One of the few, very good Italian places in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Another great experience here!   Everything was dead on except the Eggplant which really needs help.  Other than that, great!   Service was average at best.   Food is rockin!"}
{"text":"The lady on the phone who took my order, which I believe was the same one who helped me when I came in was very friendly, great customer service! I ordered the lasagna per her recommendation, it was good but not the best I've had. Great Caesar dressing but soft mush croutons killed it a bit for me. The bread was good, wish they put some butter in there for take out. Overall for about $12.50 I had a good dinner for the money, will be back to try something different.   The 1 man band on Sat night sounded pretty good and is something different for the area!"}
{"text":"Customer service - great. Food - great. All around - very happy with my experience...I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We went here per recommendation. Its a small cute family owned (I'm guessing) restaurant. Minimal decor. Menu had a good variety to choose from so I had trouble deciding. I ended up getting the veal piccata (I've never had veal so I figured I would take the opportunity to try something new). Husband got the spaghetti and meatballs special. Which seemed to be common. We also ordered the cheesy garlic bread.  Both our meals came with salads. I got the Caesar and he got the house. I must say the Caesar salad was one of the best salads I've had. I really liked the flavor of the dressing.  My meal was really good. I liked they served the pasta on the side so I could mix it in as I wanted. Spaghetti and meatballs were good.   We will probably pass on the garlic bread next time. It's basically ciabatta bread loaded with butter and garlic oil with moz cheese on top. Which how could that be bad? Lol. But I think I would have enjoyed it more if the bread was actually toasted.  Service. Our waitress was great. The rest of the girls seemed really nice. They talked about the dueling pianos and music entertainment on the weekends.  There was one woman that was just running around like crazy. Kinda got the feeling she was the owner. Then there was a gentleman sitting at the bar with a computer talking to the staff. I'm guessing he was an owner too. They seemed to micromanage their staff a bit. Made us feel bad for their staff but everyone has their own way of doing business.  Can't say if we will be back. We don't normally go out for Italian food because we know we can make it at home for a lot less money."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  It is inviting and very nicely decorated.  The staff were all friendly and very attentive.  The food is the best part!!!  So much goodness.  Many things are made from scratch.  We had the calamari which came with 2 dipping sauces and both were very good.  We had a very yummy salad that was dressed just right.  We tried the gluten free pasta and I was pleasantly surprised!  It is not soggy or gummy at all, I could not tell a difference.  They import their gluten free pasta from Italy.  The best part of the meal was the cheesecake we had for dessert.  It was a creme brulee cheese cake served with caramel sauce and berries. The cheese cake itself isnt too sweet but it had the sugary crust that creme brulee has and it was AMAZING!!  Definitely the best piece of cheesecake Ive ever tried.  If you want to support a family run local business you need to try this place out!!  I will definitely be back for the dueling piano night they host once a month!"}
{"text":"One thing I was worried about was the portion size. I wondered if I was going to feel satisfied. I had no reason to worry. The food is rich and flavorful. The staff is friendly and happy to see you. The prices were reasonable, also some real bargains on specials and wine. This should be you're neighborhood Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Bomb as hell. Amazing service. Definitely coming back next time if im in the area. Thank you"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and service!  Nice decor. Very enjoyable dining experience.  This  was my first visit and I'm sure it won't be the last.  I went early, around 4 PM, so I'm not able to advise of how busy they get or if reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little place, excellent salads, pizza, pasta and great sandwiches. The service is second to none, the atmosphere calming. Prices are fair maybe even inexpensive for what you get. The salads are unique and memorable.  The owners, husband and wife are always there and you can tell they take great pride in what they do. I recommend it for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends to enjoy food and company.  When we arrived we were quickly seated and drink orders taken.   I am a vegetarian and had no problem finding something on the menu.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and was not disappointed.   The homemade bread was delicious and service great.  We ran into some old friends and practically closed the place down getting caught up."}
{"text":"Amazing Food Fantastic Service!!!! This place is freakin amazing! The food is Real! They use fresh real ingredients no fake stuff here! In town for a business meeting, staying at the HamptoN up the road, we were looking for something close that had good food and this is it! We had the Tuscan chicken pizza one night, the chicken saltimboca and Chianti beef with the wild mushroom fettuccine the other night and it was all delicious. The staff is top notch Janessa took excellent care of us both nights, all the girls there are great at their job it's obvious they love what they do. Hands down best place we found. Can't say enough good things about this place! Oh and the drinks were super yummy too, our favorites were the coconut lime mojito and coconut pineapple colada. Also the cheesecake is the best I've ever had, very light and fluffy and absolutely exquisite! Give it a try you won't be sorry you did! P. S. Pizza is 50% off on Thursday."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's an intimate lil place. Staff is so personable. The food is just simply delicious . I been here a few times trying something new each time. My favorite so far is the shrimp fettuccine. Bruschettas are close behind ."}
{"text":"This is a great little Italian restaurant the serves fresh creative foods. It has a reasonably priced wine list that features some great tastes. I have been there a number of times for both lunch and dinner. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the silverware. They use that flat tinny stuff with sharp edges. It is a pet peeve for me. All the chef's hard work to provide a great food experience is diminished when the sharp edge of the fork scrapes across your lips."}
{"text":"Here now for the first time. I had the Spaghetti w/meatball special. It came with a nice starter salad which was a bed of spring mix with olives, pimentos and a house vinaigrette dressing. A nice sized bowl of perfectly cooked pasta, a tasty sauce and a substantial meatball filled the tank nicely. Oh, don't forget the fresh bread for dipping. All for $5.99 ! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way!  Great family owned bistro with amazing food from Chef Sal!  We have been to Zappone's for lunch, dinner and special events.  The food is just amazing!  Owner's and their staff are friendly and service was fast every time.  I have not had anything here that I did not love!"}
{"text":"Oh em gee I made the right decision when I picked this place for my birthday dinner.  Everything was delicious, service was attentive, and we will be back!  I really wanted to have their spumoni but I was too full!  The frito misto appetizer was to die for, best coating I've had on something fried, light, crisp, and not greasy at all.  The red sauce for the calamari was really good but the roasted red pepper coulis was scrumptious enough to eat with a spoon.  My husband had chicken marsala and the house salad, I had shrimp scampi rose and the Caesar salad.  All the pasta is obviously fresh as claimed, the sauces were delicious and not over salted, the salads were fresh, flavorful and well-dressed, and the proteins were tender and cooked just right.  Their pinot grigio is great too.  And they gave me a free mini cannoli for my birthday, which was sweet and very tasty.  Overall a great dinner which I look forward to reprising."}
{"text":"Friends treated me to dinner here tonight. It was a delightful surprise. Coming from NJ, I have found most Italian food in the East Valley to fall short of my expectations.   The menu is interesting. Tonight I chose the wild mushroom fettuccine which was delicious. The sauce was rich and flavorful, the pasta was freshly made on site and the bread added to the authenticity of the meal. The salad choices were Caesar or house. I chose the house which was garnished with olives and sun-dried tomatoes.   I will be back. Soon!"}
{"text":"Just ate here yesterday and the one word that comes to mind is FRESH!  I was struck by how fresh the cheese, bread, and vegetables tasted -- everything seemed fresh and high quality.  I came at a fairly slow time of day (after the lunch rush), so the food came out fast; I've also been there on days when they've been slammed however, when food took a longer time to get to the table.  I don't see this as a huge problem though because it just shows that everything is cooked fresh -- this place is definitely no fast food joint!  The servers are always polite and kind.  I've had the Caprese and Casa salads and must say I prefer the Caprese.  The Casa comes with these round rolls of shaved fennel, which I'm not the biggest fan of.  The bread they bring to each table is freshly-baked and very good.  I prefer the garlic cheese bread with some marinara dipping sauce -- but your breath WILL smell.  Their lunch-size veggie pizza is delicious but very large and in my opinion, doesn't taste good left-over, so eat it all and welcome the food coma later.  ;)  Friends also really like their sandwiches.    Lunch specials run from 11-2.  Happy hour from 3-6.  And I guess they have live music some evenings too.  One of the best Italian places around!"}
{"text":"We ended up here by accident & were pleasantly surprised. It was a busy night but the server was excellent & the food was delicious. My favorites were the lasagna & the flourless torte...soooo good. The Freshly made pasta was so worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent fare!  Well run at peak business, the manager us torally engaged.  Whoa, cheesy bread is to die for..."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!   The food is wonderful! You can really tell the pasta is homemade and the pizzas are great. The staff is so friendly and always ready to offer suggestions. My husband and I  are big fans and come back as often as possible."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY! This little gem is hidden in a strip mall next to the fitness works gym.  The owner is the chef. He comes and asks how your meal is after you are served. You just don't get that service anywhere. I always get the vodka sauce pasta with chicken, I love it so much I can't order anything else on the menu. You can taste the quality of the food. The bread is cooked fresh daily. Pastas are home made. The service is always exceptional. A restaurant of this quality is rare."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious food, great service, good music!   Great job Zappones!  Way to go Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We live in north Phoenix so nowhere near this area. Happened to be heading home after our nephew's school event. Yelped the area for some good Italian and found this place. My boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs, which I'd say was pretty good but nothing spectacular. I ordered chicken piccata. Holy Moses! A tender and very juicy chicken breast in a lemon cream sauce with capers. It was absolutely delicious! It came over a tasty pile of yellow and green zucchini squash slices, which I quickly devoured. I almost ordered more veggies but the dish also comes with a side of spaghetti Alfredo. I'm not a huge Alfredo fan. The menu says the dish comes with a side of pasta and I assumed it was a marinara dish. Boy was I wrong...and pleasantly so. That pasta bowl was pure perfection. Warm, creamy noodles that had the best flavor I've had from a pasta dish in quite some time. Also, an Italian guitarist serenaded the dining room with romantic songs, a nice touch.  As far away as we live from Zappones, I enjoyed their food so much that I'll return. It's so worth the 50 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Second time is a charm.  Service is poor. Food I think is pretty average. Overall.. Food  lacked salt.  I think I am not coming back here.  It looks like a snow bird joint."}
{"text":"Just ok, not a hometown Italian place like I expected.  Our fried ravioli appetizer was way overdone, dry and fried hard. The sauce was good.  Pasta dishes were done with homemade pasta, just enough - no generous portions here.  I would have given one star more BUT when it came time for desert our table of four asked for coffee. The server said they had none. None? As in you don't serve coffee?  No, the coffee machine broke 3 DAYS AGO.  I thought she was kidding. Nope, she said a new one should be there in a day or so.  Unbelievable. How about picking up a Mr. coffee at the local Walmart to bridge the gap here guys? To me this shows poor management.  Did we have desert anyway? No, we walked across the parking lot to the Bosa doughnuts and got a coffee there.  Can't make this stuff up."}
{"text":"We've lived around the block for years and finally tried this place. Husband is very picky about Italian food, and we both loved it. If they don't bring bread ask for it: it's divine with the warm olives. Butternut ravioli and risotto was amazing: we will be back!"}
{"text":"I recently found this restaurant when I was having a hankering for some good spaghetti and meatballs. I work in East Mesa and am not terribly familiar with mom & pop places nearby. I was blown away by how good this to-go order was! The pasta was al dente and the sauce was absolutely delicious. It also came with a generous portion of bread and a salad, all for a very reasonable price... about $10.   My next trip was only a week later (today) when I ordered the prosciutto and arugula panini. This sandwich is to die for! If you're a fan of this salty meat, you will not find a better one around. It is topped with provolone cheese, roasted red peppers, arugula, and a red wine vinegarette. I also received a side of potato chips which taste and appear to be homemade. Total came to $9.29 after tax.  There are many other items on the menu I would like to try. While some items are more expensive than others, keep in mind there is a lunch specials menu to choose from.   This will definitely be a new go-to place for me!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and had bookmarked it a while ago, so glad I did!   We decided to try this place last night l since we wanted Italian. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left everything was great!!  The atmosphere is just adorable with a cute little bar towards the back. Our server was awesome, very friendly and accommodating. The food is incredible - and quite possibly some of the best Italian food I've had here in Arizona! The restaurant does fun things with customers (cooking classes, dinner/opera nights, etc...)  Will most definitely be back - can't wait to take some of the cooking classes too!!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian place. Awesome pizza..great fresh pasta. Owners are very nice treat u like family. Sometimes they even have groupons for 10 for 20$ I think. Definitely worth coming by would recommend it for anyone"}
