{"text":"I used to be a Ryerson student downtown, so i've tried many different shawarma places as there are plenty in that area. And there seems to be them popping up everywhere. But this place was like no other. 

I had a chicken sandwich, and was convinced that these guys SPECIALIZE in making shawarmas. I can honestly say it's been the best one i've had in the city. I've since seen two spits cooking whenever i've been there, which convinced me that it has a high turnaround, which i guess is what makes the difference in their freshness.

I've tried their koobideh (their beef kabob) as well, and its been the closest thing i've had to back home (Iran). Whatever they're putting in their meat, its working!
would highly recommend this place if you're around.
advice:eat your food right there, when its hot, so that you get the full effect"}
{"text":"2 trips and 2 good meals. Pretty tasty and affordable shwarma, but the real winner is the lentil soup add on to the combo. Delicious."}
{"text":"AMAZING.
I come here for lunch at least 2ce a week and never disappointed. I actually crave it.
The chicken shawarma plates are huge and super delish, the sandwiches are amazing, the samosas are amazing, everything is amazing.
FRESH FRESH FRESH, cooked perfectly, Go and try for yourself.
I am also from West end/Downtown and there are PLENTY shawarma joints in my area. They do not come close to this place. I wish Bon A Pita was closer to my home. At least it's a 30 second walk from work!"}
