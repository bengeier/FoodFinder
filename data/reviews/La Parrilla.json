{"text":"The best bbq chicken you can get and amazing empanadas 2nd time driving 30 minutes to get some deliciousness, very recommended. The price is fare and the owners are super nice!"}
{"text":"The owner/chef is very friendly! The tacos are absolutely bomb especially their Al pastor and tripa. They make it really crispy and juicy so you could taste the full flavor. They have a mini food cart every Wednesday to Saturday and it makes it more authentic. Inside, they have homemade ice cream with tons of flavors! Our favorite in the office is the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE ice cream. It's a definitely must try."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food, the chicken tossed in chimichurri sauce was phenomenal. I also tried out the beef empanadas, would definitely reccomend trying them made fresh to order! Prices are decent and comparable to other restaurants serving the same type of food, but the personable experience made you feel like you're at someone's house. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love their food. I come here for cheap birria with rice on the weekends. Their tacos are really good. My favorite is their tripa tacos because they make it crispy. As for their desserts, they have a wide variety of ice cream, paletas, and sherbets. Their agua fresas are homemade and if you dine in, they will give you a refill. Their food is seasoned well from costillas, to the carne asada, to their homemade quesadillas. They have the friendliest employees that are eager to help you!"}
{"text":"The empanadas are to die for. The chicken is so moist and perfectly cooked-make sure you get the sauce all over. Great if you need to grab something quick and healthy to eat (think homemade dinner/lunch) or for catering if you're having a party. Seriously amazing"}
{"text":"Those potatoes are so good, it was so hard to stop eating.  Every single one of them was crispy and exploded with a bite.  But the chicken was a bit dry. I had to wait about 15-20 minutes at the place for it to be ready too.  A dry chicken is a big turn off. It tasted great but nobody wanted to have the white meat because it was tough to chew.   Will give a another try sometime."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place and it has very good reviews no matter where you look it up.  The pictures of the food here on Yelp look amazing and made me want to try La Parrilla.  the first thing that caught my eye was that amazing looking chicken sandwich that was posted on Yelp.  Yet again I ordered the chicken sandwich from Skip the Dishes. I was so excited to sink my teeth into that sandwich  Upon the drivers arrival even he said \"you ordered fro a GREAT place you will love it\".  Upon opening my sandwich I noticed this was NOT going to be the case.   The sandwich was no where near what the picture was posted on Yelp.  As you can see from my picture it was just some plain bland chicken picked off the bone and thrown onto the bun.  Very poorly done looks like it was literally thrown on the bun.  As for the taste it wasn't exactly bad but it wasn't exactly enjoyable.  It was plain dry chicken on a bun.  Not sure if I would return to La Parrilla unless I was guaranteed the sandwich in the picture from another Yelp member.  If I ever try again  I will update my review based on that experience if need be."}
{"text":"Very tasty charcoal grilled Argentinian chicken with chimichurri sauce. There really is no competing with charcoal grilled chicken.  This is a fantastic alternative to those fed up with that Portuguese place on Mac and their horrendous service.   I do recommend calling ahead here and arriving at least an hour before closing as the flame is lower leading up to close resulting in longer cooking times.    Also tried the empanada which was pretty tasty, very meat pie-ish but it was my first try of a Argentinian empanada so nothing to compare it too.  The food is a solid 4.5/5 however having to wait 20 minutes despite calling ahead on my first order and than being told I had to wait five minutes and then told sorry we have no bills take a handful of change the second visit is kind of peculiar for a place that is not nearly as busy as it will become when people find out how good the food is. Service sadly gets a 2.5/5 tanking a potential 5 star review which is doubly sad because the older gentleman that works/owns there was a pleasure and very welcoming.  All in all I am worried the service is going to get even worse but I will continue to eat their chicken until it does and I suggest anyone reading this does as well lol, just call ahead first."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out since the deserts seem so appealing I thought \"Hey food might be just as good\"   When ordering my drink I was told by the cashier that she hadn't made the drinks yet. I was sad, it's 1pm and thought by this time an establishment should be ready to go.   My meal started with chips salsa and beans, complimentary. Beans had a burnt taste and the salsa was very very water. The tortilla chips were stale. I was diappointed but still had hope I'd have a good meal.   Had the asada sope and tacos   The sope was a good size, topped with beans, asada, lettuce, sour cream and cheese.   The lettuce was not fresh and turning brown and wilted. The radishes served on the side were transparent and soft to the bite. As if they had been sitting in water for days. The taco was tiny and lacked flavor.   My conclusion, this place must not be very busy since things aren't very fresh on a Monday lunch hour. I would only return to try the deserts since it looks like that is their specialty."}
{"text":"Amazing food, best charcoal chicken in town! Family owned and runned, great service. Great portion sizes, food is overall amazing would recommend for anyone who wants a great home cooked Argentinian meal!"}
{"text":"Food had no taste. I ordered the Asado Taco and as soon as I picked it up it fell apart. The hard shell taco is very thin. I took a bite and the meat had no taste. Poured some mild sauce to maybe bring out the flavor. Nothing. Poured the hot sauce. Nothing. No taste."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade ice cream! My favorites are the rose, cheese, and pistachio flavors. Their service is always great and they'll let you sample as many flavors as you'd like. I was very impressed by how nice they are!  Their aguas frescas are also very, very good. I tried their pupusas and they were just OK, not my favorite. I will definitely be back for some sweets though!"}
{"text":"Pupusas for $1.50.  $1 only if you order at least 6 of them.  Served with a mixed greens type of salsa.  Very delicious and the salsa/sauce really gives it some dimensions.  Great deal for pupusas."}
