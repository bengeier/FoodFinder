{"text":"I ordered Ganjjajjang (???; stir fried black bean sauce with noodles) and original fried rice. The food tasted great and the servers were responsive and prompt. The price was good too, so I would love to come back.
I found it interesting that the English name of the business is Beijing Sung. It is the Korean transliteration of the business' Chinese name, ???."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Ordered extra portion for $2 extra, but it still was small. I don't know if I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Very short but to the point review here.

Previously, my go-to place for black bean noodles was Iryewon near yonge and Hilda, but the one drawback was how greasy it was...

I ordered the San Jja jang, which is having the sauce on the side.

This place has a better tasting sauce and definitely non greasy feel after you finish!

Prices are cheaper and the restaurant is cleaner too!

must try new food: Yoongiri. It's like a deep fried vinagery soy sauce chicken that is AMAZING with the black bean noodles."}
{"text":"Ever since Kum Kang San closed, I have been searching for a place that does a proper Seafood Jjamppong (Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup). Although many Korean restaurants offer the dish, I have found them lacking in flavour especially their broth and the amount of shrimp and mussels they provide. 

We came across this restaurant when we were in the area and decided to give it a try. I was hopeful that this restaurant could be the one as the name of the restaurant implies, they focus on Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun (Black Bean Noodles). 

The place is located in an industrial plaza along Steeles. There's parking but could be a bit limited depending on the time of day. The restaurant is spacious with a decent amount of seating including some private rooms. The washrooms are in the smaller size but they are clean. Service was good but they tend to disappear once food arrives. 

We came early evening on a Friday and we were promptly seated. We ordered quickly as we knew what we wanted. They only offer Kimchi and the Daikon and onions for banchan. I ordered the Seafood Jjamppong and my wife ordered the Hongap Jjamppong Bap (Rice instead of noodles plus you get egg on it). The food came really quickly and the portions were really generous. They also provided with a generous portions of mussels but not too much shrimps. Unfortunately, the broth was in the sweeter side instead of being spicy. We ordered the regular Jjajangmyun ($6)for take out and the sauce was overly sweet too. 

I would rate it at 3.5* but was disappointed on the dishes especially the Jjamppong. 

My search for the perfect Jjamppong continues in the GTA.

{"text":"This is Korean style Chinese food. Food is so good and you should try Yooringee which is made by chicken with hot peppers and sweet soy sauce. And jjajangmen is most popular black noodle in Korea. Enjoy dishes with Soju which is korean liquor. You will love it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I visited for lunch on the day of Christmas with my family. The restaurant was fully packed and we waited for about 10 min. Great place to visit with family. We had yangjangpi, tangsooyuk (sweet and sour pork), kkanpoonggi (sweet, sour and spicy chicken), jjajangmen and jjamppong. They were all excellent and food was served pretty fast. Great new business near York U."}
{"text":"The place was fairly big with plenty of seating.  Service was friendly and available.  Food was good, we ordered the sweet and spicy fried chicken (small).  When it came it looked like it was  a huge portion, but the chicken was on a giant bed of lettuce.  But then I thought lettuce was a good touch because after the heavy chicken you are almost eating a salad underneath.  Black bean noodles were pretty average.  But the chicken was the star, we were told that was their signature dish and it was good.  Location is a bit out of the way though so I would say I would come back if I happen to be in the area."}
