{"text":"Big Al's is fine.  It's diner food and you get what you expect.  It took us two tries to go here for breakfast on a weekend.  The first time was at about 10 a.m., and there was a line out the door, and we didn't want to wait.  The second time we got there closer to 9 a.m. and we got a table right away.

I ordered the corned beef hash, which is supposedly the dish to try.  It's not terribly memorable, but it was good.  The service was adequate and the mood of the place was generally up beat.  I left full and satisfied, but not inspired.  

While I would go back without any reservations, I wouldn't do so with any great enthusiasm either.  Give it a try ... or don't ... you'll be fine either way."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch/breakfast place!  Traditional dinner setting with no pretentiousness. Huge portions and fresh ingredients. Not exactly a cheap diner but you do get your money's worth. Also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The dine-in experience was just okay, nothing to get excited about. The food portions are pretty large, but the price reflects it. The second time I came, it was carry out. I bought a strip steak, asked for medium done but I got a dry overcooked steak. Also got french toast and the burned size was hidden on the bottom when I turned it over. Terrible experience second time around. Especially for a reputable diner. This was bad enough to turn me away from trying this place again. Good luck."}
{"text":"A place I always try to hit whenever I'm visiting CLE. The menu is pretty standard diner fare, but it's prepared well and there are some items like salmon cakes and fried green tomatoes that are a bit out of the ordinary. The atmosphere is great, too, with friendly servers and a pretty diverse mix of diners. You might wait for a table at peak times, but usually you can find a spot without too much trouble."}
{"text":"A quite literal hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but a fantastic one at that. There isn't much seating space which makes for a decently crowded room, but the food is worth the wait. 

Our waitress was a sweetheart and suggested the phenomenal home fries with onions and green peppers over just plain HF- such a great choice! The pancakes are huge and fluffy; delicious with fresh blueberries and strawberry topping. 

If you can get past the cramped space and seat-yourself-and-someone-will-be-with-you-in-a-moment mentality, Big Al's diner is really a great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The food and the portions were not bad, it's the only thing saving my review from a 1-star.

The service is beyond awful.  This place has terribly managed wait staff.  Completely went out of the way to ruin my experience.

Let's start from the beginning.

Me and two friends heard about this and decided to check it out.  So we noticed there's a wait.  I'm used to this sort of thing, however there's no organization on who is getting waited on first.  People were cutting in line to grab a table first, the staff barely gave a hoot about that.  In fact, we had to find someone to actually ask for a seat.  Luckily the locals eventually were nice to us when I started insisting we would just squeeze in a table that really didn't fit us, but I was losing my patience quickly.  This ordeal took 45 minutes and we were \"next\" in line, even though we watched two group cut right in front of us.

It took 10 minutes to get our waters and 1 tea.  10 minutes.  Then she walked away for ANOTHER 10 minutes after dropping the drinks off.  When I flagged one of the girls to take our order, she said she had to get another server to serve us \"right away\".  That took literally 15 minutes.  I stared at how many orders were waiting in the kitchen and there were 3, so it's not like the kitchen was backed up..
Now the food came out fast but COMPLETELY disorganized.  We were constantly telling them we were missing someone's homefries, someone's grits, waiting on someone else's toast, etc.  Mind you, server never came to check up on us ever, no drink refills, nothing.  We never saw her.  Nice girl, but came back to give us our check.  I let my friend do the nice talking because I was fuming at that point and didn't want to be a jerk nor create a scene.  No one had any sense of urgency, all the workers took their sweet time to help tables, but no one had any sense of checking up on all their tables rather only particular ones.
In short, the servers all seemed like they're beginners.  I asked for recommendation or what people usually get, server had NO clue (I'm sorry but every restaurant I've been to, even new servers are trained what the signature or popular dishes are. Awful training and customer service). Didn't even bother asking someone else. They're completely unorganized, don't check up on you, and take forever to get any simple request for you.

I should also mention the bathrooms had flies swarming all over the place.  
Nasty.

I can see why to-go orders were popular. Food is tasty (I enjoyed the homefries and the corned beef hash), but NEVER EVER eat-in.  Take it to go.  That's what a lot of people were already doing, and I don't blame them.


*edit*
I'm looking at other reviews and I'm noticing a pattern with the awful service.  You'd think that the management or owners actually give a damn and try to actually train their waitstaff.  I never tip below 20% but I couldn't justify giving more than a buck for a $15 bill."}
{"text":"I have to tell you, when we went to Big Al's, I was underwhelmed by the look of the place.  Not that it is the most important thing to me when I go somewhere to eat.  Because if I am ever back in the Cleveland area, I will absolutely be returning for more of their breakfast.  As Michael Symon said on The Best Thing I Ever Ate, it is almost obnoxious how large the plates are.  And the pricing is spot on as well as the service.  Want a great breakfast with a menu of variety, go to Big Al's!!"}
{"text":"I like the food here. Nothing really extraordinary, solid menu. It's a seat yourself place. You may end up sitting with strangers at your table. I didn't mind, but if you do, be aware of that."}
{"text":"This place had a good review in Cleveland Magazine so I had to check it out. I was leary about the location but as they say, \"never judge a book by it's cover!\" It was busy at 11am on a Sunday morning. Ordered some coffee while looking over the menu and it tasted like dish water.  The atmosphere was nothing special and the place was dirty. I ordered the western omelet. It took a long time to get the food and the service was lousy, slow and unpleasant! The omelet was good and fresh veggies were used. However, after eating and letting it all digest, it did not sit well in my stomach! My friend ordered the famous corned beef and hash and raved about it. Perhaps that's the only thing on the menu worth going here for...otherwise, not worth it."}
{"text":"Big Al's Diner is a sure bet for reasonably priced, overportioned diner food.  It's a local favorite, and the place is always packed for weekend brunch.

Eggs are always cooked just right, and their homefries are flavored nicely and cooked with onions.  Other favorites include eggs benedict and fluffy blueberry pancakes bigger than your face.  My only complaint is the biscuits and gravy, which tastes great but just not enough gravy to smother everything.

Service is usually good but variable near closing time.  Overall Big Al's has nice atmosphere and unpretentious, well prepared diner food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The past few times I've been there, the service was horrible. So, I stopped going. I tried  again today and again the service was terrible. After waiting 10 plus minutes and not being acknowledged by a server, a server waited on the table next to me with people that just sat down. I finally had to ask for service."}
{"text":"I had high hopes when we found such a charming diner near our new home, and we came several times. The food was forest and the prices were alright, but the service is consistently terrible. 
The drawback of having customers seat themselves is that often we went completely unnoticed, and this last time we waited 20 minutes, during which we were visited by a server twice to check in on us, and told we would be gotten to shortly. 
It was disheartening to say the least, as I had planned to continue coming even with the long wait, but that level of disorganization and customer neglect will not warrant another visit."}
{"text":"I was in town in Cleveland for work for a couple months and I ended staying around the corner from Big Al's. What good luck. It's not flashy, it's not fancy, it's not big, it's just a small diner. You walk in, sit where you want, one of ladies working there will come ask you if you want coffee and take your order. Even when it's packed the food comes out quick (unless you're in the group of 8 having Sunday brunch after church). They drop your check off when you order and when you're done, you just pay at the register. 

It's not a place you come if you're on a diet. The biscuits with sausage gravy, 2 eggs, and home fries (aka #12) is simply amazing. The eggs, cooked to order, are buttery and perfect. The gravy is rich and sausagey, but not as heavy as expected. Tge biscuit are delicious in tgeir own right and a tasty vessel to sop up the runny egg yolks and gravy. Always go for the homefries if you have the option. The grits are a disappointment compared to the home fries. My only complaint is this place closes at 2:30. 

Ps - when they ask if you want onion with your home fries, say yes!"}
{"text":"I come to eat lunch here occasionally and am always greeted kindly by Al and his staff.  I always get the thrill burger which is nice and the fries here are top notch."}
{"text":"Great family diner.  Huge portions and delicious breakfast.  Must get the homefries with onions.  Pancakes are huge and tasty.  One of the better breakfast places in this area."}
{"text":"This was a great diner.  I went here with my two 4-year old sons after visiting the Great Lakes Science Center for a late lunch.  It is smallish and you can definitely feel the family-nature of the place.  The servers were down-to-earth and helpful for a dad out with his boys.  

I had eggs with corned beef hash.  Huge serving of terrific hash with fresh green peppers and a large amount of corned beef.  Have to say it was some of the best hash I have had.  My kids had scrambled eggs and pancakes.  Both were great.  The coffee was hot and plentiful."}
{"text":"I'd give three stars, but this place really isn't worth the hype, so I'm giving it two to make a point. Go to Michael's at Shaker Square down the street, the food is a lot better for the same price."}
{"text":"NOT impressed.. Service is ok - Staff with plain faces.. Not a single smile, but never mistreated. 
The food is just ORDINARY, I believe you can have the same exactly kind of food in many other corner diners around."}
{"text":"I like the tuna melt personally. I am  a pescatarian that dosnt eat eggs and this diner does it well. I have experienced diners all over and this reminds me of a diner in new york. Down to businrss waitress and diner food. I have always been pleased with this diner food."}
{"text":"The food gets five stars the service gets zero, even for a diner the place is dirty and unkempt. They have some new servers  there  that are atrocious,if you have been there before you will know after being ignored our waitress  for close to ten mins after waiting patiently didn't work politely waving didn't either  the nice red head girl with a star tattos comes over and saves the day everything goes smoothly at that point the other twohas filthy clothes shoes with holes  on the sides and they are stained muddy brown her underwear tag hanging out, fix up quickly al's or I won't be back! And the dirty napkins everwhere wtf!?  I have been offered a date by trannys at steves lunch at 4 am that looked and smelled better then your new staff!"}
{"text":"Best damn breakfast in Cleveland! I moved to Los Angeles and its what I miss most about Cleveland!!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly Al's smile and friendly greeting is no more. Al shut his doors a couple of months ago and when that happened  some of the best comfort food in the area shut down with it. 

Al open up some place else and post here all about it!"}
{"text":"Just had to leave after waiting way too long. Thank goodness for the lady bussing tables or I would not have even gotten a beverage...people coming in and getting serviced before me...I guess I put on my invisible body suit this moring...smdh"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday morning at around 10am. There was a small line of people at the door yet there were 3 empty tables that hadn't been cleaned yet so people couldn't sit down yet. That's always disappointing since you see the potential to sit down while you're waiting in line, but you can't since they haven't kept up with bussing/cleaning the tables. The food was very good - not fantastic out of this world, but definitely good. My daughter had the chocolate pancakes and I had the blueberry pancakes as well as the potato pancakes w/ applesauce and a side of fruit. The service was slow and generally average ... not necessarily unfriendly, just lackluster. The potato pancakes were excellent. The pancakes where slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle but not super tasty -- again, good but not great. The fruit salad was fresh, had watermelon, apples, pineapple and mango -- the mango was hard and pale as it was not close to being ripe, but I applaud the attempt to use mango nonetheless, just use ripe ones. I'll be back, but it's not a place I will crave to rush back to."}
{"text":"Decided to try the famed corned beef hash. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  I walked in and seated myself at the counter for a takeout order. No one acknowledged me. Waitresses were talking to each other and eating. I had to ask a waitress if she would take my order. She obliged but that's it. No asking if I wanted a drink of water as I waited  for my food. The corned beef hash was bland typical greasy spoon type of food. I could definitely do better in my own kitchen.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I ventured to Larchmere Blvd to Big Al's. Why?  Because I was told that it was the place for the best corned beef hash.  Michael Symon might have said that portion sizes were obnoxious, but I prefer to say that this place was gluttony at it's finest.  

I am from the far west suburbs of Cleveland.  It is no secret that out that far west we are a different kind of wimp.  I grew up in Avon Lake, I wear shirts that are ironed, pants that don't have holes in them, and I wash my hands when I go to the bathroom.  To say that I fit in a place like this would be to tell you that Sarah Palin created the theory of relativity.  I was a fish out of water. 

So if I thought it was great, why the three star?  Pretty simple.  As HUGE as the portions were, the corned beef hash wasn't, as Symon called it, the best.  I have actually had better, but the atmosphere was amazing.  It is what you expect when you say diner.  A cramped hole in the wall where the servers also serve as the expo girls, and also the cashiers.  It is a place where you know that the grill has probably not been cleaned in close to 20 years, but you know what, you're ok with that.  

This place has as much a place on your radar as any other breakfast joint, the difference, you get to go through the neighborhoods that you wouldn't dare go through on any other day.  What's funny, you find nicer people in a place like this and you don't feel bad for eating here, because you know your money is going directly into this neighborhood and this community and not some nameless corporation in New York City [I'm looking at you Perkins].

Don't shy away."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like Big Al's Diner, but our breakfast was completely disappointing. (I will say, however, that other reviewers' comments about lack of cleanliness and unfriendly servers were unfounded.)

The large portion of \"famous\" corned beef hash (with over-easy eggs) was undistinguished: quite bland, under-seasoned. Its diced potatoes should have been browned first, to enhance texture and taste. How difficult is it, also, to serve hot, completely buttered, crunchy toast on the side?

Finally, the one thing that a diner MUST deliver is a good cup of coffee, and Big Al's Diner failed miserably -- probably a combination of low-quality beans brewed in a coffee maker in need of thorough cleaning.  I wish I had more positives to report..."}
{"text":"Big Al seems to be the only person working here - he's the chef and the server - so service is extremely slow. 

I understand that the prices are low, but I'd go elsewhere for faster service and better tasting food. I ordered the BLT, and it looked and tasted really sad. Yes, the BLT was sad. The toast was too thick and there was more toast than the contents within it (maybe two pieces of bacon, some lettuce and two slices of tomato). Additional fries with the BLT was $2.00 - some crispy and some soggy. 

Coffee is self-serve and refillable. After your meal, you pay up at the front. The vibe is like a school cafeteria and the set up is like Johnny Rockets but there's no warmth to it. I think the decor needs some work to attract people who want to have a happy brunch with the family.  

Sorry Big Al, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Sorry to see the previous reviewer have such a bad experience...maybe it was an off day?

I have been here twice, and had great experiences both times.  Big Al's Diner is truly a small \"hole in the wall\" type joint, but don't let that deceive you...their food is rock solid.

My favorite dish (both times there) for breakfast has been the corned beef hash, a plate piled high with potatoes, onions, green peppers, shaved corned beef topped off with two eggs (I go over easy to enjoy the runny goodness).  Coffee is endless and tasty and the service prompt and attentive, but not overly so.

Would eat here again without question."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food. The wait is 3-5 minutes tops and I'm always satisfied!

Thanks Al's!!!"}
{"text":"I used to work her a few years back. open everyday except christmas. SOmetimes the cups are dirty-just send it back and ask for a new one. They close at 2:30pm but open at like 6:30 am. I think they raise prices every year which is a drag. good corn beef hash- whenever i'm at a restaurant and order it-I make sure it tastes like big al's."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. No frills, but friendly, fast service.  Eggs, French Toast, Sausage for $3.85.  The food was excellent.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Cleveland!! By far!!  You need to get past the cramped space and the inconsistent service but the pancakes are the BEST!! Cheap eats!! Greasy spoon atmosphere. We are Sunday regulars"}
{"text":"I will be giving this another shot, so that is a good sign.  So today's experience was not overly great.  Mainly because we it took the server close to 45 minutes to take our order.  Then it was about 30 minutes to get the order.  I will add that it was only happening to us.  Folks all around us were coming and going just fine.

So, to the food.  It is a pretty good breakfast menu.  The prices are reasonable and the quality is in line.  I loved the homey atmosphere.  It s very 'small town' feeling.  

The corned beef hash is pretty good.  It had great flavor, onion and bell pepper.  Only issue for me is the potatoes were a little on the too chunky side.  

So I will need to come back and see if things are better a second time around.  I have an eye on the coconut cake."}
{"text":"I'm curious who is writing these positive reviews and if they are truly real people. It certainly wasn't anyone that was in the diner today. 

First off, we had to wait a considerable amount of time just to place our order even though the place wasn't full. Why? Because they were busy fixing \"a complete f**k up\" (as it was phrased) at another table. Wrong orders, wrong prices, wrong drinks, wrong everything. We probably should have walked out right there, but we didn't complain. Just enjoyed our coffee and waited, thinking maybe that table was just being difficult. 

Anyway, we finally place our order and about 10 minutes later, they bring out my wife's plate (eggs benedict kinda thing). She waits for me to get my plate. And waits. And waits. And waits. Finally, I tell her to just go ahead and eat. 

She cuts into the first egg, and instead of the yolk running all over everything like it's supposed to, it's solid as a rock. She sort of eats around and it, and just as my food finally comes out (about ten minutes after hers), she finds a short and curly hair underneath it all. She almost pukes right there, and now I'm reluctant to eat my food. She throws her napkin on it and says she was full anyway, and for me to go ahead and eat. 

I got the #13 - two eggs, toast, country fried steak and home fries. The eggs and toast were good. Everything else was awful. The steak may have well just been bread crumbs. There was quite literally no meat to be eaten, and the breading was so tasteless that I just dumped it on to my wife's plate to get it out of the way. The homefries were a soggy mess. No crisp. No crunch. And, no taste. 

We just said screw it and were ready to complain when another table threw a fit about their food - wrong order, forgotten sides, etc. And then the table behind us also found a hair in their food. Both our table and theirs told the waitress and the response was - \"hm sorry.\" 

I see a few people screaming \"it's a diner, not a restaurant.\" I get that, and I'm all for that. But consistently screwing up orders, having tasteless food, and hair in multiple plates at one time? That's beyond any \"it's a diner\" claim. It's disgusting. 

My only solace on my wasted morning is that I hope people read this and avoid the same fate."}
{"text":"Big Al's delivers every time. The atmosphere is a fantastic breakfast dive that draws a diverse and alternative crowd. The food is the best traditional breakfast I've had in Cleveland. The coffee is always hot, the pancakes are fluffy, the hash is awesome and cream chipped beef is exactly what it should be. I always  roll out of Al's every time I go!"}
{"text":"We came here because it was voted the best diner in Ohio.  I demand a recount on that vote.  Horrible service, waited over 10 minutes just to order, never got a refill on coffee, can't cook over medium eggs, and then had to wait 10 minutes at the counter to pay.  Nothing redeeming about this diner, and can't understand how it became the best diner in Ohio.  Ever.  
And the other reviews are accurate, very unhappy servers."}
{"text":"Yum!!  We used to order breakfast from here all the time.  We always got it to go b/c it's kind of a small place and isn't very visually pleasing.  I liked it so much I'd always order two breakfasts b/c I never could decide on one.  It's definitely comfort food.  I wouldn't go here expecting gourmet food.  Greasy spoon is a good descriptor."}
{"text":"Pretty good deal. Two meals and a coffee for $23 including tip. Servers are nice and attentive. Came in the last hour on Sunday after an estate sale. Was going to get fried chicken sandwich but the cole slaw was not made there. I had the tuna melt w onion rings. He had the blueberry pancakes, which were huge. Both were very good. A group stuck their head in the door and offered to pray w any patrons who wanted to step outside. Parking lot is tight but open on main and side street."}
{"text":"My first time there but I herd so much about place stop by Sunday morning get a breakfast sandwich, walk to back bar sat there for 7 min before some spoke and said for here or go. How about good morning thanks for stopping by can I help you with a smile and no attitude. THE 2 young waitress, black female rud, rolled her eyes at didnt speak after I watch the cook look over to tell her I was there, so I will never go back first impression are the best too much attitude and nobody smile or friendly, the egg and bacon sandwich was okay I could have done better at home"}
{"text":"While working in the area Big Al's was strongly recommended to me and my coworkers. It is a very small diner. After entering you're not sure wether you seat yourself or be seated. We were directed by the waitress across the room to seat ourselves. This is your typical diner with a variety of comfort food menu items. I got the Reuben and fries, one coworker ordered an omelet, the other a fried fish sandwich. All of our meal portions were a decent size. I was very pleased with the taste of my sandwich. The coworker who ordered the fish was not, she said it was a tasteless minced fish fillet straight out the freezer. The omelette was a winner too, pretty large with fresh ingredients. The service was fairly fast but not the friendliest  waitress. No drink refills and no checking up on our meals. My sandwich and fries came to around $9, not too bad for the amount of food. Would I come back, probably, is it one of my more memorable diner experiences, no. I'll probably try a breakfast item next time."}
{"text":"I can easily see why there are so many mixed reviews for this place: it's divey, it's crowded, it's got cheap if basic breakfast eats, the service is just fine, and--in all honesty--you could probably say the place needs a deep clean (I say this because I slipped and slid all the way to the bathroom in my can-handle-icy winter boots). BUTTTTT it's perfect for what it is. We showed up at 9am on a Sunday, beating the church brunch rush, and had our food within 10 minutes. I was a bit worried about vegetarian options, but I needn't have been: they had plenty. My veggie omelet was good, if basic, incredibly HUGE and came with a massive side of onion-topped potatoes and two slices of toast. The potatoes were perfect, just the right amount of crisp. My husband's biscuits and gravy were less impressive: he got maybe a quarter cup of gravy atop both of his biscuits...why so little? And then the woman next to us got about two cups atop hers...why so much more? We asked if she ordered extra and she said no, so don't expect consistency with food ratios at Big Al's, is the lesson here. Overall, we got out of there with very full bellies for very cheap prices and my husband has already suggested going back. If you're hesitating, definitely give Big Al's a try and see for yourself. You won't have a bad experience, just a basic breakfast diner one--but what more could you honestly expect?"}
{"text":"My favorite dive diner. Be patient, as it does tend to fill up and you'll probably have to wait for a seat, but it's worth the wait. Service can be slow and coffee refills, as well, but the food...sooooo yummy!!! I like the #6 with pancakes (sometimes chocolate chips) and my boyfriend loves the #12 biscuits and gravy! You get a huge plate of food that we usually never finish, no matter how hungry or hungover we are. We can't stay away, Big Al's is a true gem."}
{"text":"Big Al's is my go-to breakfast place. It's a little rough on the edges, but I never wait long for a table (even if there's a line waiting when I arrive) and the food is quick to come out.

For some odd reason, I'm in love with their coffee. I know they get it from a local Cleveland roaster, but it's very smooth and robust. Their corned beef hash is my favorite in Cleveland so far! They use real corned beef-not that canned stuff- and give you a whole lot of it. 

There's always a restaurant.com deal for here too, so consider buying it to save a few bucks!"}
{"text":"your classic hole in the wall diner...this place is great!

good food served fast, and the price is right."}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars

I'll always remember Big Al's Diner as my neighborhood diner. However, my most recent experience with the food wasn't superb, and this may be because diners just aren't super friendly for vegetarians (pescetarian, technically.)

(Before I made this life choice, I've enjoyed some of the other selections, including a pretty good corned beef hash and a pretty tasty fried liver dish.)

I was very excited for my order of potato pancakes (sans bacon), but when they arrived, they weren't very crispy, they were very greasy, and they didn't quite look homemade. I'm usually a sucker for anything potato, and the combo of apple sauce and sour cream usually is pretty tasty with potato dishes, but for some reason the mixture just wasn't very appetizing.

My friend ordered a breakfast special (~$3) and another friend ordered the corned beef hash. They both liked theirs. I tried the hash browns and they were very crispy and delicious. One of the pastries was super sweet and not very fresh."}
{"text":"The service needs a major overhaul however, the Pecan Waffle gave me life. I just wish the service was better but overall the diner's food gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"12/31/14. Diner is reportedly under new management. Had been there a couple years ago and food and service were excellent. Today, though, we had terrible customer service and sub-par food. We were ignored when we entered, seated ourselves. Two waitresses at separate times said they would take our orders. Ordered food and waited about 30 minutes.  Had the worst breakfast I've ever had. Nothing was hot when served. Scrambled eggs undercooked, hash brown potatoes greasy and mushy, frozen breaded deep-fried salmon patty was mostly bread inside and flavorless, Texas toast was a spongy disappointment. Michael Symon may rave about their corned beef hash, but what I saw on the plate of the friendly guy at the adjoining table looked more like minced cat food. Chaos reigns here. Untrained staff. Line of people waiting and tables uncleared. Won't be going back. I expect they will be closed within a year unless they make some major changes or call Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"We recently called Big Al's to order food to say thank you to the staff at cleveland clinic.   When we  called to inquire about ordering a spread they laughed at us and were  rude and dismissive.  Instead of being helpful their attitude made it easy to say I would never give them my support.  I would rather go to Jacks any day."}
{"text":"To say the least, Big Al's is working hard to maintain their status as average.  Average diner, average area, average food.  There's nothing special going on here.  Bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles, toast, home fries, corned beef hash -- all made the same way as any other non-descript diner anywhere across the country."}
{"text":"this place was great!

prices looked to be cheap to me, and you get a GANG of food. we went for breakfast and it was rammed. just as we were walking in, a table cleared which was nice; as i didn't see another table become available while we were eating. i had a vegetable omelette with extra tomatoes and a couple extra slices of wheat toast. this omelette was gargantuan, and was served with home fries. in all actuality, the home fries were nothing more than what looked to be an entire baked potato chopped up and served next to the mega omelette. the eggs were nice and light, the vegetables were fresh, too, which will make or break anywhere i buy breakfast from. no canned mushrooms, and no canned tomatoes. big up yourself, big al. all told, i paid less than ten dollars after tax for my enormoid breakfast and very attentive service.

{"text":"I learned of Big Al's Diner on Diner, Dives and Drive ins from the food network and the reviews were accurate. When visiting the diner, make sure to seat yourself at an available booth/table and beware, it's a very SMALL location. 
The staff is friendly, but busy taking orders and making sure the food is served, so service can be considered slow. They are a mom and pop shop, this is not a typical chain where they focus on customer service, but the food if worth the wait! The french toast, eggs and sausage were very good and seasoned just right...ENJOY the experience of Big Al's Diner!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst and most insulting service I've ever received in my life. The food was excellent, hence the second star, but the experience was just awful. My boyfriend and I walked in around noon on a Sunday. The restaurant was almost full but not quite. We were told by a young, miserable looking hostess to sit anywhere. She soon brings us water and asks if we want anything else to drink, we order coffee. She left and I wondered if her face would crack if she smiled. 5 minutes pass. 10 minutes pass. A group of 5 loud obnoxious people walk in. They sit down, loudly, and rudely ask for the table to be wiped. The unsmiling girl takes her time wiping a different table before slowly going to them. I try to get her attention. Another more upbeat server saunters over to their table and offers them all coffee. I call to her \"could we also please get some coffee and possibly some service?\" She responds \"oh are you ready to order?\" I reply, \"yes we've been here for a long time\" another couple minutes pass. I longingly look at the coffee the 5 are drinking. Finally our server comes over. We place our order and she asks if we want drinks other than water. I almost beg her for coffee. After another couple minutes I call to the first upbeat server and truly do beg her for coffee. It was then promptly served... Food came at a reasonable time. It was delicious. No one ever checked on us, refilled our empty water glasses or coffee mugs. Saw another couple also looking a bit distraught. But most people looked content. Couldn't help at this point but wonder if the fact that the other couple and us were the only white people in there. It made me uncomfortable to think it but... At the end of our meal, my boyfriend walks over the counter and asks for a box for my food since obviously no one is coming back. We pay and we leave. And we are never going back. Yes, the food was delicious. But being ignored and treated like our requests for service were the most tiresome things in the world on top of feeling racially judged, are enough reasons to keep me away."}
{"text":"One of my top breakfast spots! Their food is so delicious! and their portions are HUGE. Only thing that bothered me is that a flat, not so special waffle is $3.50. Sheesh. Anyways, the service is great, very pleasant and attentive. And besides the waffle, prices are great for the portion size. I ordered the veggie benny and it was so good. My favorite part is the abundant amount of onions they put in the home fries. How can you go wrong with onions and the great seasoning they put on the home fries-love. Also great coffee with free refills! I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I can not believe that before we even get inside of the restaurant, we were treated with bad customer service. My boyfriend and I woke up early to go to Big Al's since we have heard such good things. We got there at 6:30am but sat in the car for an extra 15min to get the staff extra time to set up. We went to the door at 6:45am and it was locked. So we went back to the car and decided to give them some extra time. I went back to the door at 7:06am. I saw the cook and the two servers talking in the back. I went back to the car. We called the restaurant to see what time they opened and no one answered the phone. Since I did not knock on the door, my boyfriend went back to the door, it was still locked. He knocked on the door and got the server's attention. He reported that she just looked at him and said nothing. If the restaurant does not open at 6:30am, the owners need to change the sign on the door and their website. I really can not believe that no one even acknowledged us or answered the phone. This was awful customer service."}
{"text":"I get the corned beef hash and if I'm feeling like really clogging my arteries I'll get a side of hollandaise sauce and dump that on top. The portions are massive, the flavor is good, and the price is right. Definitely worth going and checking out."}
{"text":"First time here for brunch. Portion sizes are awesome, especially for their cake. Don't be put off by the appearance, it is still open and making great food. Even though there is only a couple people serving and running the register, making the service a little slow, once ordered the food is out surprisingly fast. Just moved here from Memphis, TN where I like to think the city knows it's way around breakfast, and this place will be on my list to frequent here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just what you'd expect. A downhome diner with generous portions. Don't go for the ambience- go for the great breakfast and the fact that the locals come back again and again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot (have only had breakfast). Good with kids.  Good and quick service.  Would return."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, the staff is beyond rude and I witnessed the owner blow his nose then continue to work with his BARE hands in the kitchen. Will NOT ever return. It's sad this place has \"regulars\" with how disgusting it is. I wouldn't be surprised if the place was infested with rats."}
{"text":"food ok. restaurant filthy. employees need to practice basic sanitation and hygiene standards. clean  it up!"}
{"text":"Omg I don't understand what people love about this place I mean it took us literally an hour to get our food and when we did get it it wasn't even that great. Also our server came to our table twice the entire time we were there once to take our order and once to drop off the check. Plus my friends cream for his coffee was spoiled and the silverware was dirty. Do not recommend it"}
{"text":"Ive been here a bunch of times. Its good but I dont understand all the hype. Its a little divey place on Larchmere that are known for their breakfasts which are reasonably priced and the locals rant and rave about the corned beef hash. The coffee is good. Breakfasts are good. Meh Nothing special. I go in all the time."}
{"text":"I have not been pleased with the food the past few months. They must have a new cook back there. JUST BEWARE...pancakes are normally amazing, but mine where horrible...veggies werent cut up at all for my veggie omelette...the young lady that cleans off the tables, and brings your beverages can be very immature."}
{"text":"Despite it's compact size, Big Al's flavor is anything but.  This was evident by the long line we discovered upon arrival.  The food was delicious,  an order of French toast scrambled eggs and bacon with a cup of coffee.  The food is budget friendly also. Two #8 special ms at 6.25 each plus tip.  Looking for a good weekend breakfast stop this is definitely the place to be."}
{"text":"Three weeks and they have yet to actually be open when their hours state.  They supposedly open every weekday at 6:30am.  Each of the last three weeks I have attempted to stop in at 7:30am and none of those times have they actually been open.  One time I called and actually got an answer from one of the cooks, who told me that \"the waitresses aren't here yet\" try back in 10 minutes.  10 minutes later, no waitresses.  

The food is great greasy spoon fare, but this lack of consistency is getting ridiculous.  I will also echo others that when you are actually seated service can be downright awful.  Most of the staff their treat you as if you are a task to be dealt with and not a customer.

Love the food, but they need new management stat!!!!"}
{"text":"It's your bog standard diner with really good corned beef hash. I've been here three times. The first time I got the corned beef hash and then the two other times I got a different dish. Good food, good service, but you'll be waiting a long time if you go during peak diner hours. Aside from \"that famous chef\" giving it a shout-out, I think this establishment is so busy because it's one of the only diners in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars for the HARD WORKING AND ACCOMMODATING SERVERS BUT THE FOOD WAS NOT GOOD. The grits were instant and watery, the biscuits were not homemade or even pillsbury they were out of the microwave the only things that werewolf was the eggs and water! If I go back I will remember to only order eggs and water!"}
{"text":"I've literally been coming here since I was a child. We lived on a street off of Larchmere for most of my childhood so this place was our breakfast go to. On a recent trip back to Cleveland to visit my family we obviously had to meet here for Sunday brunch and it is exactly as I remember it. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. Everyone is always friendly and the food is always made pretty quick. It's also a rare spot where the takeout is ALWAYS equally as fresh and tasty as dining in. 

The inside is pretty small so it can be a challenge to find seating but again takeout is equally as good here. Make sure you get the home fries with onions because that could be a meal in itself, they give you a huge plate of it and you can tell all the veggies are fresh. They even give you the crispy \"burnt\" edges which are my favorite part. 

You really can't go wrong here and you can feel good about supporting a local long time standing neighborhood institution. Just eat here already!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is a DINER, not a restaurant.  There is a difference.  There are no tablecloths.  Limited breakfast and lunch menu, comfort food served up fresh and hot in large portions reasonably priced.  Omelets were huge with generous amounts of the added veggies and meats.  The signature corned beef hash lives up to the hype.  The ambiance is the essence of life in the CLE - diversity at its best.  Parking can be a challenge.  Although the parking lot seems adequate for the size of the dining room, it gets full easily.  Overall, worth a trip for an outstanding classic breakfast."}
{"text":"Classic diner.  The western omelette with cheddar, peppers and ham was delicious.  The home fries with onions on top were addictive.  Theres often a wait to dine here. 
The portions are enough for sharing.  We split the omelette which comes with home fries and toast among two of us."}
{"text":"Big Al's is a no-frills, hole-in-the-wall diner when you're craving greasy but satisfying breakfast. Don't miss their corned beef hash! Pancakes are aiite. The french toast is also solid. Eggs don't always come out the way you requested. For instance, my friend's over-medium were more over-raw, and my poached eggs were over cooked. I am a serious egg aficionado so stuff like this really grinds my gears. You also just have to be okay with the hit-or-miss service. We had to ask a few times for our coffee and cream. Regardless the servers are friendly enough and the breakfast is pretty gratifying. Definitely a good option after a night of debauchery!"}
{"text":"Michael Symon told me to get the corned beef hash, so...I did...and you should too."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good - although today when I went the homefries were just French fries cooked on the griddle (they weren't crispy - just mushy and weird). Our server was very nice but made some mistakes. Overall, a pretty good place for a classic, simple diner-style breakfast."}
{"text":"Big Al, this place is headed downhill.  I had some out of town guests visiting who mentioned they had heard about this place.  I had also heard about it from some Cleveland colleagues, but had never gotten a chance to check it out so we all ventured together over to Big Al's.  We got there early on a Sunday (~930AM), walked on and no one made any eye contact with us.  We stood awkwardly at the door, until I waved down a waitress who told me that you seat yourself.  Okay, we can handle that.  Sat down at a table that needed to be bused still, and eventually a waitress came over to clean the table with what appeared to be a dirty washrag.  Each side of the table got one laminated placemat that also served as the menu.  I'm not a germophobe, but I couldn't help thinking what the kitchen must look like if this is the way they \"clean\" in between patrons.  I ordered the corned beef hash, which is what they're supposedly known for.  Not a fan.  The corned beef was dry like it had been scraped off the griddle.  The potatoes, green peppers, onions were greasy and nothing special.  The coffee was eh, and my cup was empty way too long for a diner.  Oh, did I mention that they brought the wrong meal to one of my group members?  They didn't really seem to care about the mistake when we brought it to their attention. My group member ended up eating the wrong meal regardless since it had taken SOOOO long to get her food to begin with.  When I went up to pay the bill, I waited about 10 minutes just for someone to come over to handle my check.  No eye contact, no hello, just a \"Give me your bill.\"  Oh and she also complained about how hot she was.

I very rarely give a restaurant one star, but between the lack of service, dirty environment and bad food I really couldn't find much to give this place a star.  I guess I did get a close parking spot?  If Michael Symon thinks this place has the best corned beef hash he's ever eaten, then he obviously must have eaten here a long time ago."}
{"text":"This review is about 3.5 stars, but upping to 4 because I adore small, neighborhood diners.  A friend and I pre-breakfasted here last week (friends wanted to brunch and we were too famished to wait until noon).  We split a Western omelet with home fries and wheat toast.  Everything was cooked to perfection and was served within an appropriate amount of time after ordering.  After viewing the home fries on other diners' plates, we opted to get ours \"extra cooked\", which yielded nicely browned and crispy potatoes.  I would recommend visiting if you're in the Shaker Heights area and want to try a cool, neighborhood diner."}
{"text":"My soulmate and I came here on a brisk Saturday morning this past weekend.  She suggested it earlier during the week for the phenomenal food, but ever since my experience with some sad diner in Maine 14 years ago, I have been quite skeptical of the whole diner scene overall.  Fortunately, I am here to tell you today, folks, that my skepticism of diners has been fully released from my massive egotistical diner-hating mind, thanks to Big Al.  

She parks in the parking lot and commences to full sprint towards the front door.  I thought this could be attributed entirely to her being hangry, but after whipping out my Nike Free 5.0's and chasing after her inside, I witness a scene straight out of Club Obi Wan in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom...tables flipped, patrons lying on the floor unconscious, food mysteriously becoming clothing for many.  I look in the corner and see the beautiful gleaming smile of my boo waiting patiently for me beyond the apocalyptic scene of destruction.  Oh, how I love her!  I sat down and waited for the scene to normalize; she told me that table selection is given entirely to the patrons of this establishment.  Suddenly her destructive tendencies were quite understandable.

After normalization was established within our environment, I proceeded to take it all in.  I noticed a picture of the Three Stooges.  I do enjoy their crazy antics...and look!  They were golfing!  I also like to party.  Already Big Al knew me all too well!  Smiley faces were glued onto the window sill next to us...fuzzy too!!  I do love me some fuzzy smiley faces, their tender touch and eternal happiness just gives me goosebumps on my raging pecs.  

My darling ordered the corned beef hash combo, I placed an order for the country fried steak combo and a side of fried green tomatoes (that movie, still to this day, gives me major feels...oh Idgie!).  I see that people complained a lot already about the servers in this establishment...let me just tell you right now, this is how it should always be.  Take my order, bring the food/check, and hella leave us alone!  PERFECTO!  We received our meal at relatively the expected pace I would assume this food should be cooked to order with.

The corned beef hash was AMAZEBALLS.  The country fried steak was AMAZEBALLS (true or false story...this may be pork.  It also may be beef steak.  The answer may be in between).  The eggs were AMAZEBALLS.  The toast was AMAZEBALLS.  The fried green tomatoes (along with the movie) were AMAZEBALLS.  Tears started swelling and falling down my cheeks and I may have made a mistake in my pants...honestly I didn't check them the rest of the day as my mind was on the food from this point onward.  My love looked to have the same thing happen...I believe we truly found God on this day -- maybe temporarily, but the magic is still there as I write this today.

We received the check and proceeded to pay.  It was a sad moment, thinking about leaving this little nook of a diner, but all good things must end at some point in a day.  I noticed a food tray in the counter that had a pretty fine looking woman on it, we do have quite the fetish for such things...of course after the right modifications.  I attempted to haggle with the cashier over this treasure, but ultimately I only was offered a tin of Borax.  Maybe this is the cause of all the angst over the working staff in this fine establishment?  The world may never know, but surely I know one thing....Big Al definitely knows how to create food ecstasy!"}
{"text":"Solid food at a decent price. I will come back here. Looks like they are in the middle of a renovation. This a cute part of town and this place is right in the middle of the action. They have been around for a while and will continue to be. Sausage gravy and biscuits are the thing here. I will try the corned beef hash next time. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Everything was fresh and the potato pancakes in particular were divine. We're here visiting but if we lived close by, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Flanking the Western end of Larchmere Blvd. and just North of Shaker Square, Big Al's Diner has been a locally popular greasy spoon destination for years. 

The breakfast and lunch menu consists of every comfort food item imaginable. The prices seem fair and the service is always friendly. The small dining room is usually bustling busy for breakfast, so either get there early or have the patience to wait for a seat to open. 

On a recent episode of  Food Network's, \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\", Episode: Wake-up Call, Cleveland's own, Michael Symon name-dropped Big Al's Diner as the place he goes for the best Corned Beef Hash. 

As a tribute to MS, I had to try the hash on my latest visit. The corned beef and onions were perfectly browned and nicely crusted. As a substitute for normal diced potatoes, this hash contained what appeared to be chopped, hand cut French fries. Green peppers were also apparent which added a unique flavor that I'm not used to from this dish. To finish it off, the hash was topped with two perfectly cooked fried eggs over easy. I love breaking into the yolk and it oozing all over the hash. Yum! It'll be awfully difficult to order something else the next time I go to Big Al's!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a nice breaksfast/brunch place, and was not disappointed. Food was really good. Service was weird, wasn't acknowledge at the hostess stand rather just stood there dumbfounded to know if we sat our selves or get seated after 3 minutes of waiting at the door. I don't like having my checks already placed on my table the same time the food comes, but overall a good exception experience."}
{"text":"Big Al's Diner is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Corned beef hash with eggs over easy is a must. It's pretty much one of the best things that I have ever eaten, hands down. I've been here a bunch of times and it is always phenomenal. The blueberry pancakes are huge, fluffy, delicious, and bursting at the seams with blueberries. The prices are low, but you get a ton of food. It's small and you seat yourself, but we've never had an issue getting a table."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon style breakfast. Corned beef hash is the best thing on the menu. 

The pancakes taste kinda funny so stuck with the savory menu items. 

Service here is hit or miss. On a good day your order will be taken in a timely fashion, your order will be right, & they remember to refill your coffee. Don't expect any smiles."}
{"text":"A mom and pops diner with delicious food at a very reasonable price. Definitely try to catch their morning breakfast specials (before 10:30am on weekdays) to get an even better deal! The corn beef hash is delicious. Be ready to eat because the serving size is huGe!"}
{"text":"Big Al's is a great hole-in-the-wall breakfast spot. The corned beef hash is the reason I continue to come back (also why they were featured on food networks \"best I've ever ate\" show). Friendly staff, good food. The only downside to this place is that a first-time customer may be turned off by how dirty and drab it looks inside."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday morning, which happened to be the day of the Cavaliers parade after they won the NBA final championship. Although the restaurant was supposed to be open at 6:30AM, they didn't open until 8AM. The lady said they'd open \"in ten minutes\" but didn't follow this, so I started this review with two stars. To be fair, I understand the staff were probably out celebrating late at night, but a sign should've been placed on the door regarding the opening time. There were about 6 of us waiting for the restaurant to open. Had it not been for other yelpers stating that Michael Symon recommended this place, I probably would've headed elsewhere.

I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast with overeasy eggs. It was okay - your typical diner food. At least the meat was actually in hash form and not cubed or diced. I thought there were a little too many veggies (onions, potatoes, and bell peppers). The ratio of veggies to meat was 1:1, but I prefer more meat (since that's the name of the dish). I also am not sure about bell peppers in my corned beef hash. I prefer just meat, potatoes, and onions, but maybe that's just me.

My entree with orange juice cost about $16 including tax and tip. It seems a bit pricey for breakfast, but you're supporting a local mom and pop place. I think the exterior could be improved, since the building is extremely dilapidated. If it wasn't for cars already parked in the back and people standing outside, I would've thought the restaurant was closed permanently!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place.

The \"creamer\" on the tables is some powdered non-dairy concoction mixed with water. But that's OK because you wouldn't want to drink the watery, flavorless coffee anyway.

The much heralded corned beef hash had decent flavor, but a mushy texture. Nothing special.

If you're looking for a good breakfast nearby, you'd be better off at Yours Truly."}
{"text":"If this is the best corned beef hash Michael Simon has ever tasted then he has been deprived !  All I can say is for what this place offers it is overpriced"}
{"text":"Some people might like to use the 'greasy spoon' moniker on Big Al's. I prefer to call it a great find in an unexpected place.

Words that come to mind: hearty, honest, delightfully simple, homey, inviting, casual, just right.

People say that its a good sign when the locals eat at a restaurant. In the case of Big Al's, I take the mixed crowd as an indicator of why I keep coming back. Any morning you'll find a mixture of people enjoying one of the best breakfasts in Cleveburg. Suits and ties to pajamas and everything else in between.

The portions are more than generous. The food is carefully prepared - someone is actually paying attention in the kitchen! Its surprisingly easy to screw up breakfast and Big Al's knows how to avoid that. You'll notice that someone was making sure your meal is cooked right.

Get off your routine, give that chain restaurant a break and stop by at Big Al's already!"}
{"text":"Wow what a pleasant surprise to eat here the food was excellent service was good but they need a better dishwasher lol overall great diner food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"When I woke up this morning I said \"I want greasy southern home style cookin\" and Big AL's delivered. Sizable portions low prices and just the atmosphere I was looking for. Small on the inside with no air conditioning creates a nostalgic memory of grandmas kitchen from when we were kids. Speaking of grandmas kitchen big Al's is the ONLY place to rivals grams scrambled eggs. Fluffy but not dry. How does REAL potatoes sound the lost art of the home fry ruined by bob Evans has been resurrected at big als. Pricing is great, atmosphere is a must, and food is phenomenal. You'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"Breakfast was a gross disappointment. The egg had shell pieces and the waffle was cold and soggy. Not headed there again."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and the service just got progressively worse each time. The food is actually pretty good, with hefty portions and low prices. I will not go back, however, because the service was lousy. We had to wait for a table, were seated at a dirty table, did not get any refills, and no one checked on us outside of taking our order. I'm not really a picky or needy guy when it comes to diners, but this was a bit ridiculous. It's sad to see a great little greasy spoon with a clearly skilled kitchen staff brought down by wait staff who don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Has wonderful corned beef hash.  It's the only thing I would recommend there though. First come first serve.  No reservations."}
{"text":"I don't like to give 1 star but I was left with no choice. We were visiting and heard nothing but the best about Big Al's Diner. 
When we walked in we were not greeted, we waited for a few minutes before someone told us to sit down. The only tables available were ones that had not been bused. We waited about 5 minutes before someone came and took away the plates from the diners that sat at the table before us and wiped down the table with a dirty rag that smelled. 
After our order was taken the food was slow and not that great. Someone at our table got the wrong (like a totally different dish) order and when we notified the waitress we were told that they would have to remake the order (we already waited over 30 minutes for our food) so she decided to just eat the wrong dish. 
There was nothing special about the food and the corned beef hash was dry and did not have a lot of flavor. My potatoes were not fully cooked but I was too hungry to wait another 30 minutes. Overall I would say that everyone at the table left at least 25% of their food on their plate. 
Given everything I would recommend skipping Big Al's."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Always great. My complaint? The attitudes of a few of the waitresses. Seriously eating and ignoring customers while it's busy.Extremely crappy and rude replies. Rolling of the eyes, dirty clothing and nails too long. 
There are a pair of servers that have been there for years.. Pray you get one of them.. Big Al... Please screen your new employees and hire kind people that care about your restaurant. Cleveland loves your food!"}
{"text":"Where to start: my girlfriend and I came here because we'd heard such great things. I should have read some reviews. It took 5 minutes just to wipe down a dirty table. Our server had the nastiest attitude and mumbled everything making it impossible to even understand her. We were never asked about drinks and when my girlfriend ordered a diet coke, a diet Pepsi was finally brought out towards the end of our meal. 

As far as the food goes, I ordered an omelet and my girlfriend ordered eggs and biscuits and gravy. My omelet featured a cold and what appeared to be pre made egg patty and half melted cheese. The biscuits were hard and the gravy wasn't very good either. On the plus side, the home fries with onions were pretty good. 

Overall, our experience was pretty awful. We will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"SSSSLLLLOOOOOOOOWWW

Here is the timeline of our visit.

10:45 Arrived
10:53 Sat
11:16 Order taken by waitress (23 minutes after seating)
11:54 Food arrived (61 mins from the time we sat down)
12:12 Departed

The food was good but we had breakfast fare, so it's hard to make pancakes, eggs, sausage and grits be spectacular or be terrible.

The service was awful. The waitress was surly. No \"hello\", \"enjoy your meal\", \"how is everything?\" - nothing. Same with the cashier, who I had to wait five minutes for. Never spoke a word to me.

I read that Michael Symon once said something nice about Big Al's, and another customer mentioned it to us when we were waiting for a table, there' a picture of him on the wall with a quote and they even had a sign on the table about him. Big whoop. Just because Michael Symon likes your corned beef hash, that doesn't mean you get to make people wait an hour for scrambled eggs. It also doesn't mean that you get to forgo common courtesies like \"Thank you\".

In the future, we will drive to the Waffle House in Willoughby where we can get equal food, a better value for money and much friendlier service. Also, it will still be a helluva lot faster, even with the 20 minute drive each way."}
{"text":"Good solid local town diner. It is small and can get busy, so best to go at odd times."}
{"text":"They changed names and moved from York University but it's the same owner.  I work down the street from them and go here weekly, it's always been good!

I haven't tried anything from the breakfast menu yet, but their burgers, onion rings, and chicken salads are delicious.  Good portion size for the $, quick/friendly service, easy parking/access, and good food."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST breakfast spots in Cleveland! The servers are akways friendly and smiling. The corned beef hash is the top notch. 
The pancakes are thick and fluffy and hard to finish, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy Hot Greasy Mess of Delicious Diner Eats !!! 

I love this place. Nothing new and shiny here, just good home-cooked breakfast and lunch eats that are sure to fill your belly and have you begging for tums! We frequent this spot on Sunday mornings, and offer this advice... the earlier you show up the better chances you'll have at getting a table. 

The restaurant is very casual and can get a little cramped, but it is worth the occasional spacial issue. Also, you never know who you could meet at the table next to you. 

Big Al's has the best pulled pork sandwich that I have ever had and their omelets are guaranteed to please. Also, if you want your potatoes crunchy or your omelet really custom, they will do it for you and get it right. 


 Check them out if you are looking for a delicious greasy spoon with local charm."}
{"text":"I'm always sticking to their corn beef hash - it doesn't really look like the traditional type, but I liked their changes - adding some bell pepper and some other stuff, tasted pretty good! The service was quick as well. Although it's not a place for you to have a fine dining experience, but it's makes you feel pretty down to earth. It's not the cleanest breakfast place I've seen, but the quality and price are definitely good/reasonable. Some of the waitresses, esp the one who helps with bill payment always looked really bored and tired. She needs to wake up a little bit and have a better customer service spirit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - the food is cheap, greasy, and good. The atmosphere is bustling and full of character and characters. The perfect Cleveland dive spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I order today and did not receive what I ordered. I was not  given my full order which would have been ok if I was eating in. This was an order for a couple people and take out. This is the second time the staff could not complete a simple task. A month ago I ordered and was over charged. This once was one of the best places to eat in the area now I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of people complain that this place is small hot and that it's not the cleanest, but that's what makes it great it's nice and cozy and it's familiar and that's what makes this place so great. They also have great food. I love the breakfast I especially love love love the pancakes it's what I always get and hashbrowns are really good. This place is cool to me it is just a really nice cozy family family type place. If you want a seat you really have to get there at a certain time otherwise just wait. It is a seat yourself restaurant so if it's just you and another person you can find a spot fairly quickly and sit. More then likely you'll be sitting elbow and elbow with another couple or family which is cool. If you want to be alone, in a booth, by yourself and you want to have a \"clean\" type atmosphere (not saying that this place is dirty because it's not)this is just not the place for you, this feels like home. If you don't want to be home don't come here"}
{"text":"Not even sure where to begin. I've been hearing about this place for a while and finally after 3 failed attempts my girlfriend and I paid them a visit. The food was good but the service was supremely lacking! The place is super small which is not a big deal to me but its a bit awkward when the place is super crowded. Overall, if you live within 3 blocks its worth checking out...otherwise just pass it up!"}
{"text":"We frequented Big Al's for their great coffee and reasonable prices. We turned a blind eye over and over again to how dirty the place is and how nasty and impatient the wait staff was. Finally after becoming basically regular customers, we hit the end of our tolerance for indifferent and sometimes downright rude behavior on the part of most of the wait staff. 
For a while we just scratched our heads, were somewhat amused about the ambience...or lack of. We are excellent tippers, always appreciative but it finally became too toxic to actually go and pay money for such treatment.
The place is owned by an absentee owner who lives elsewhere, shows up twice a year and obviously makes his living not needing to care about his employees behavior, accountability or how they represent him.
We have found a decent replacement for our breakfasts with less filth, kinder and more attentive wait people who actually are willing to serve for the same price. We far prefer to share our hard earned dollars with them.
Never again."}
