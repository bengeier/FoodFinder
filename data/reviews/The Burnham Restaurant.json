{"text":"This was not the best experience. The food was decent and the service was terrible. Waited entirely too long for basic things like drinks and to place our order.. mind you, the place was no where near full. Our waitress could have cared less about anything, and it showed. 

Won't be going back ever. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent service & food.  I had the grilled salmon & my husband had the muffuletta sandwich.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I was at The Burnham for the first time this past weekend.  It was my friends birthday and we had a party of 6.  The service was great!  Our server was super nice, kept our drinks full and brought out our food in a timely manner.  I got the salmon and it was delicious!  The skin was super crispy and it was a large portion.  Everyone at the table was pleased with their dishes as well.  The staff was very welcoming.  I would highly suggest going here."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a restaurant that strives to exactly satisfy the average palate of the average American diner, this is the place for you. The menu and the wine list will have exactly all the regular, normal choices that the average eater will not be offended by. If you want a memorable meal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible. Had reservations. Not busy. Hostess was clueless. Left us at restaurant bar and kept seating people with no reservations. Talked to hostess, did not care. Never seated us. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Slow service and okay food.
Only ate here because too cold to walk anywhere. Waiter spent most of the time chatting with another table while I needed service.  Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp and dumplings and fried calamari as appetizers. They were pretty good. For dinner I had the blackened salmon and my partner had the hangar steak. Both were cooked wonderfully."}
{"text":"I stopped in here a few weeks ago when my friend and I were trying to go to the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event and we were starving. It was pretty empty while we were in here, so we got a seat right away. Our server was great - very attentive and our food was super timely. I ordered the Southwest Shrimp Pizza, which was delicious. I wish I could have taken it home with me, but I was heading out for a night on the town, so I had nowhere to stash it. This place is great for an anniversary dinner, lunch with a friend or colleague, or a place to celebrate a family occasion."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with two others and did not have a great experience. It was pretty busy upon arrival, however we made a reservation so we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. It was a nice day so we were asked if we'd like outdoor seating, which we agreed to. 

Service was extremely poor. We had a reservation for 12:15, we were sat at 12:20 and we did not get our food until 1:20. It took 20 minutes for our server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and another 5-10 minutes for my soda to arrive. We weren't told what the soup of the day was, we weren't told about any specials and we weren't even asked if we'd dined with them before (this place just opened after all). All in all, our server took 30 minutes just to take our order.

25-30 minutes later our food arrived. My friends got the field green salads (which they actually enjoyed, hence the two stars). I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich, which I did not enjoy at all. The breading on the chicken was bland and tasteless and to be honest, when I cut my chicken open with my knife (this is an open-faced sandwich by the way, something the menu doesn't say) it looked pretty gross in the middle. My fries were simple shoestring fries that tasted fine.

The poor service in combination with the bland tasting food will be the reason I likely will not return. With all the great restaurants available in Cleveland, this one is not worth going to (at least for lunch)."}
{"text":"The breakfast is spectacular, egg enhancements for the breakfast buffet were sensational. Dinner was good I suppose but the breakfast is what you should come here for. The eggs benedict is a must get"}
{"text":"I love this place! Sherri the bartender was awesome and Chef Ryan brought the food directly to me! What a friendly environment I had the buffalo pizza and Caesar salad my first night and the muffalatta sandwich the next day. Everything was fresh and tasty!!"}
{"text":"I came here looking for lunch that was better than what was serving at the convention center nearby.  I ordered decaf coffee, a grilled turkey club on gluten-free bread, and seafood bisque.  On balance, I have more bad to say than good.  The bread was nice, and was beautifully toasted. But the turkey in it was still chilly.  The soup and coffee were barely warm.

Also the food took a surprisingly long time to arrive, which was frustrating because I wanted to get back to the convention center.  I was there around 2PM, and there were few customers, so there was no excuse.

Total cost was $22."}
{"text":"Ordered brunch to go on 1/21/18 from the bartender Tiffany who was very welcoming and hospitable.  As any hotel restaurant, the prices were steep for the amount of food I received but that was to be expected.  I ordered the steak and eggs.  The potatoes were excellent, the asparagus was good, the steak was more medium than med-rare but that's also common.  My main complaint is that I only got one (very small) egg and it had too much pepper on it.  I also got a biscuit that was supposed to come with butter and there was no butter included."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel and decided to check out this restaurant. All of us were very impressed with the food and staff. The hanger steak I had was amazing. Their version of the carrot cake was nothing like I have ever had but it was great. If I ever go back to cleveland I will make sure I return."}
{"text":"The bread was stale, and the Caesar salad was like something you'd get at a grab and go refrigerated shelf at a supermarket."}
{"text":"Attention to detail on favorite comfort foods such as the Shrimp and Grits and Fried Chicken with charred cabbage results in lively fresh takes on tradition. However the staff was not up to par, the hostesses could not pull up our reservation, waitress got our dessert order wrong, forgot what my entree was immediately after I ordered and there was that discussion on what Prosecco is. That being said, this is a newly opened restaurant and there is clearly a lot of field training going on. Just wish the staff was better prepared. Rating would be higher except for the service.
We'll be back in a few months after the kinks are worked out as the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"The fact that this place has 3 dollar signs is not accurate to me. I had a chicken confit small plate, which was more than filling, and it was about $11. I was really craving fried chicken and that meal hit the spot with hints of exotic undertones! Really nice, modern, and quiet ambiance for a late dinner and the staff is readily available to suggest what to eat. My co-worker and I enjoyed the experience. 

Only thing I would say is that the menu needs an interpreter basically. When you first look at it you read something like bread pudding but then underneath it states there are gizzards in it. Not typically what you would think, right? Fact of the matter is, after our waitress explained the take on bread pudding and french toast that they utilized, it was much easier to make a decision. My co-worker got a french toast type plate which was a savory take on a pulled pork dish and she thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"It was Christmas Day, so this place may have been running on holiday fumes.  Our food was decent, including my sweet potato gnocchi.  My companion, however, had a strange goat cheese panna cotta with sad wilted greens and, for some reason, chips. My mom liked her butternut squash soup. Overall, it was decent hotel food, but nothing that I'd return for.

Our sever, however, didn't seem to know much about the menu, and left our plates sitting well after we had finished.  I know it was a holiday, so maybe it was just an off day. She was very friendly, though.

The local art is a fun touch.  The space is light filled."}
{"text":"I came here for a late solo dinner, got in on a business flight around 10 PM.  I had two small plates, the shitake perogies and the goat cheese creme brulee because they sounded the most intriguing to me.  B  The goat cheese was rich if not particularly flavorful, went very nicely with the crostini that came along with it.  The perogies were a definite hit however, savory with tart sauerkraut and a nice mashed potato side.

The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  A nice selection of beers on draft.  Overall a very acceptable hotel restaurant, can't comment on the entree options but overall this is a place worth a visit if you want something simple and are staying at the Hilton."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times while staying at the hotel. Overall the service has been okay to poor. The food is OK. But the first couple times it has been cold. Breakfast buffet is also cold. Expensive, or at least more expensive than you would expect for the quality. 

Coffee is good."}
{"text":"I, too, am typically wary of hotel restaurants (usually way overpriced for the fare) but based on other reviews, I took a chance.  I had a Caesar salad and the seared sea scallops.  The latter were excellent and accompanied by some great fried smashed potatoes.  Someone was trying to get too creative with the Caesar by adding shaved Brussels sprouts (I nixed those right at ordering), a slice of anchovy toast in lieu of croutons, and a dressing that was a bit too tangy for me.  Altogether edible but not something I would order again.
The rest of the menu was interesting enough that I will return.

Prices are a little higher than average but not outrageous.  Except for the iced tea.  $4 (really)? One of those \"poke you in the eye\" items higher end restaurants always like to introduce."}
{"text":"Hotel restaurants are always hit or miss but this one was a nice experience. The ambiance is upbeat and lively -- an open kitchen will also help with that -- and the prices were fair, if not better than expected. My Cotes du Rhone Rosé was $9.50 a glass and the dinner specials on a Saturday night included a super affordable (and pleasantly portioned) Sous Vide Chicken plate. Nothing crazy but just a nice simple home cooked meal while traveling -- something we all crave. 

The Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that. I wasn't however, a fan of the BBQ sauce that adorned the chicken. Thankfully, it was mostly served on the side so the dish was still a great choice. 

Johnny was a very pleasant server and we worked up a nice rapport by the end. His recommendations were genuine and he steered me toward a dish that I would enjoy - one thing I appreciate in a server! His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum!

All in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)!

Final thing: I loved their dining chairs. Upholstered and so comfortable. It may sound silly but chairs make a huge difference! I felt relaxed the whole time."}
{"text":"We came in after watching a sunset up at Bar 32 on a Friday evening. I had read all the Burnham reviews and looked at the menu on line. It looked very promising. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away. 

We had a reservation which was not required. 40-60% full during the peak dining hour. Service while attentive was only hotel restaurant style, Lacking the type of service professionals found in fine dining establishments. The menu was very well composed and interesting. It offered some good choices. But the preparation and presentation was just ok. The prices were not outrageous. 

No way it gets 5 stars. So not a destination place in my book. If I have to meet someone staying in the hotel, I am happy to have a meal there. But no more Burnham date nights for me."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken confit. I swear on earth I've never had anything better. It was the perfect size and the cheese dumplings on the side were perfect."}
{"text":"Chose to visit the new Hilton Downtown and new restaurant for a birthday.  Chose this restaurant because our party had been to most restaurants in Cleveland and the Burnham had only been open 16 days when we ate there.  

Ours was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates.  After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice.  All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party.  The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland.  The chilaquiles were like a mexican pancake with pulled pork and rock shrimp baked in.  The shrimp and grits were great.

Our second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza.  While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good.  The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british/irish delicacy and delight.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were great.  The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was.  The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful.

Our party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75).  The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious.

The staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant.  The new hotel is beautiful inside.  Wish the Bar 32 (bar and patio on the 32nd floor) was open but its still not finished.

Our server Joseph made the night especially nice with his knowledge and hospitality.

Would like to try breakfast/brunch next time maybe but we will definitely by back."}
{"text":"The brunch buffet had a beautiful display and was dutifully maintained. The eggs were a strange, jiggly texture and bland. The French toast was great, but the syrup was flavorless. Excellent tasting and perfectly portioned smoothie shots. Not all of the items were clearly labeled so my vegan friend was upset from consuming meat in the potato hash. I recommend signs for each prepared item with symbols for meat, dairy, soy, seafood, and vegan items. 

Thank you for handling our large group with great service and attention."}
{"text":"Overall impressions: swanky lounge in a swanky hotel serving up new takes on old favorites. Staff are still growing into their roles, but friendly. Good for dressy dates, business meetings, and hopefully drinks on the patio when the weather is warmer! 

It's a shame that this shiny new part of Cleveland doesn't get the traffic it deserves after the boom that was Summer 2016. Getting here is about a 10 min walk from the RTA station, but at night, when there's hardly anyone around, and your phone light is shining brighter than the streetlights... The empty buildings can be pretty eerie. Buuut, I guess I can't complain about having my pick of the reservation times during Downtown Restaurant Week. 

The Burnham can be entered directly from the side of the Hilton building, and my friend and I were pretty impressed by the upscale nautical wall deco. Everything still looked as though the plastic wrap had just been taken off. We were shown in short order to our table, a half-booth ordeal. Normally I'm all about the booth tables, but our booties sank a little too deep into the plush seat and made the table an awkward height to lean your arms on. Which, if you have just above can't-take-you-ANYWHERE etiquette like me, you tend to do quite often. Anyways. We were brought some complimentary bread and olive oil while looking through our menus, but the server nearly dropped the bread on the table instead of our plates, and the bread was quite plainly not fresh. A rough start. 

Our hearts and stomachs dropped a little when we saw our first appetizer (not part of the Prix Fixe menu), five tiny Garlic & Onion Beignets. This was definitely not Southern hospitality. They were pretty good, but gone too soon, including the pickle garnish. Each of us then chose different salads for the first course and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ingredients. No plain Caesar from the grab bag - mine had a crunchy mix of greens, pickles, sunchoke, and a light dressing. Main course involved a Swordfish Schnitzel for me, and a Sous Vide Fried Chicken for her. You heard right. Schnitzel and sous vide, chicken and swordfish? Did they draw these combos out of a hat? Maybe, but they work surprisingly well together - both meats were tender, the accompanying sides (radish + mashed potatoes for me) appropriately balancing. I could probably have done with less salt overall, but know that you'll be leaving full after an entree. The desserts were cute trays of Petit Fours, including cake pops and macarons. Nothing mind-boggling, but easy to pack up and eat on the go. 

Like others have said, service was fairly slow. It took a while for our dishes to come and for water to be refilled even though we were one of probably five tables that evening. The staff is definitely rough around the edges compared to the establishment (I mean, have you SEEN the bathrooms? Go, just go outside across the hallway, and enjoy the gilded glory.). It's not a place you should expect to grab a quick bite - although I think I spotted a kid eating chicken tenders a few tables over. But food-wise, we felt we got what we paid $30 (+ an appetizer) for. The menu, the staff, the booty-sucking seats, it all feels a little experimental, but I think we got some positive results out of the evening."}
{"text":"The waiter was poorly trained and seemed unhappy with his job. Complained that Lebron was a bad tipper. Interrupted our business conversations.  Didnt give me a menu until i asked. We had bought 2 bottles of wine and he did not come back to refill.  Frankly I was a bit embarrassed hosting a business meeting there.  Food was unremarkable as well."}
{"text":"Mediocre review for the following reasons:
1) price point is pretty high for the quality. Keeping in mind this restaurant is surrounded by a plethora of fine establishments in Downtown Cleveland. So, my opinion is that the food is better in a number of other restaurants for this price point (and some lower for that matter). Cleveland is a Foodie town, I'd head somewhere else next time I stay at the Hilton. Plenty of fierce foodie competition and in walking distance too.
2) My order was messed up. That happens. I wasn't put off until they fumbled the apology. I ordered filet mignon with roasted root vegetables. The vegetables, squash and potato varieties, came hard as a rock. They looked delicious but inedible so I sent them back to the kitchen. I was happy to wait for a properly cooked batch. They returned my plate with steamed broccoli. That did not meet my expectations for a $45-$50 entree. I personally enjoy the delicious root vegetables that grace our plates every fall, so there's no way broccoli was going to make me happy. Also, serving a guest raw root vegetables is a pretty big technical error, again considering the price point. 
3) the manager did visit my table and seemed confused as to why I was disappointed. Perhaps I was unable to clearly express my expectations. When I go to a nice restaurant, I hope to have a properly cooked meal that exceeds the quality of what I cook at home. I realize broccoli steams faster than root vegetables cook, that's why I do it at home. For the same reason I ordered Filet Mignon and not a ham sandwich, it's the entire package, the entire presentation. Broccoli was a bandaid solution when I expected the entree I ordered to be done properly. 
4) there was some sort of staff training going on in the dining area. It was about treating the guests properly and service related. The manager(?) addressing the staff was speaking at a volume inappropriate for a dining room. Who in the heck wants to listen to you tell your staff at high volume how to serve guests appropriately?!? I came to have dinner in a nice restaurant. It's not McDonalds people. I shouldn't hear you. Schedule your training before dinner service. Be professional. 
5) After speaking with the manager who was apologetic but missing the point, my bottle of wine was no charge. Honestly I would have been happy to just have had my original order cooked properly. I never did get those root vegetables. But I appreciate the effort to make things right.
In the end, there's just too many great restaurants in Cleveland to warrant returning to the Burnham."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our night sitting at the bar at The Burnham. Rob the bartender/mixologist (not to sound too hipster but this guy is a professional) was very knowledgeable, funny and a great steward for Cleveland. He gave us tips on where to spend our weekend and he did not disappoint!

On to the food: Husbandface was obsessed with the pierogies, I was obsessed with the French toast small plate. I'm going to try to recreate it at home and will probably fail a million times it was so good.

Drinks: Thumbs up. Let Rob know what your tastes are and trust him to make you your personality in a glass. Because that pretty much happened.

It was our first time in Cleveland and we had to force ourselves to NOT go back to the Burnham for every meal just so we could branch out!"}
{"text":"Came for my birthday dinner.  The hotel is new and very beautifully designed, and we had read good reviews of the Burnham.  Did not disappoint!  I recommend the small plates--so much choice!  I had the peiroghi, the fried chicken confit, and the table shared the cheese creme with mushroom.  H had the oyster spaghetti.  Excellent service--not pushy, not absent.  Crowd is good--dates/couples, friends/family meet up.  I don't think this is a kid place--definitely an adult vibe.  I'd like to stay down here and make it a whole night away in my own city."}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffet. Includes ordering your choice of freshly made entrees. Fresh squeezed juice. Hot coffee. Fresh fruit. Hot options. Gluten free choices. Good service. The views of Lake Erie are beautiful."}
{"text":"Ate here when I arrived in the evening on a business trip. It was a strange restaurant. There was a large buffet that appeared to just be supplies (not for customers). 

The waitress couldn't answer any of our questions. My colleague and I both have fairly typical food restrictions (I don't eat meat; he's Celiac/gluten-intolerant) but the waitress didn't know what would be suitable for either of us. The menu did not indicate some key ingredients, either (like that they use bacon fat on the green bean sides). 

She asked the chef and he suggested a salad for my colleague and a pizza for me. The pizza a 6-inch flatbread. It was ok, but felt like an appetizer. 

Overall, it was fine for the lazy evening after a long day of travel, but I wouldn't go again if there were other choices."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast while staying at ttle hotel. The service was very prompt and friendly. The view was beautiful and the atmosphere was calming."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner a few weeks ago. My friend and I were planning to do apps and drinks at the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event so we decided to head downstairs for dinner. A lot of things on the menu sounded really good to me, but I went with my usual go to and ordered the salmon. It was pretty good, but was just super salty so not the best I've ever had. My friend ordered the Southwest shrimp pizza, which was amazing! We were one of only 3 or 4 tables in the restaurant so service was great. The prices were about average with most restaurants downtown so nothing too shocking."}
{"text":"This was not a pleasant experience. I was in town for work and looking for a nice meal after a very long morning of flights and meetings. The server was very pleasant, but the menu was very small. I tried the Lobster Bisque soup and the overwhelming fish smell upon its arrival to the table made me question the freshness of the ingredients. After perusing the entrees I realized that if I wanted any kind of beef entree, that my only choice on the menu was a hamburger. I asked if they had any other beef items and my server said the Chef might be able to prepare me a steak from the dinner menu. I agreed and ordered a 5 oz. sirloin (only option they gave me) cooked medium. When it arrived, it was ON a bed of fries, it was over cooked, and someone had already sliced my steak into several pieces. Instead of sending it back, I gave up on the kitchen, ate my meal and chalked this experience up as a fail. The only positive was that my server was very friendly.... not very knowledgeable of the restaurant, but friendly."}
{"text":"The Cleveland Plain Dealer gave this restaurant an excellent rating, so I made reservations.  After that I read other reviews, some of which were negative, so I dined a there tonight fearful that I had made a mistake.  I was delighted by the delicious food and excellent service!  I highly recommend it and hope that others will try it, as it was pretty empty on a Saturday night, although this could have been caused by upcoming Fathers' Day.
Visit the bar on the 32nd floor for a wonderful view of the city.
I will return and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Food was good. Had to wait a very long time for eggs and sausage. Team seemed to be short-staffed in the kitchen. The wait impacted my overall experience. I expected more efficiency from a 4-star hotel."}
{"text":"The food here is over priced but fresh tasting.  Overall not a bad food experience.  The service on the other hand is really bad.  Inattentive servers to say the least.  The only thing they managed to be prompt with was the bill, which was delivered with my meal."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for a Hotel. Much better places in downtown, especially for dinner. Service was terrible.  Hilton needs to up service in the restaurant.
My wife and I were meeting people in the terrific bar on the 32nd floor. I showed up late an had trouble getting someone so i could order a drink.

Decide to have dinner in the Burnham.  It was 8:30 on a week night. Almost no one in the place. Our server may have also been the bartender.  She paid almost no attention to us. 
Bad service can certainly ruin a good meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place one star before ever stepping foot into the restaurant... 

I called on a Monday to make a reservation for 12 people. I was told by the gentleman who answered the phone that he needed manager approval for that many people, and put me on hold. I waited a few minutes, and when he returned he informed me that he couldn't find a manager but would take down my information and someone would call me back. I waited 24 hours and didn't hear from anyone, so I called back. I explained that I had called the day before and needed to speak to a manager, and was placed on hold for ELEVEN MINUTES before I finally hung up. I called back for a third time and immediately asked to speak to a manager, by which the person responded rudely \"well can I take a message, we are a little busy right now.\" I said \"no, you may not take a message, I need to speak with a manager immediately.\" I was placed on hold AGAIN, this time for more than five minutes. I FINALLY got a manager, Franc, on the phone who didn't even bother apologizing for my troubles. 

On Wednesday I get a call from the restaurant (two days after my first attempt to make a reservation) telling me they couldn't accommodate my party. I explained to them that the manager had confirmed just yesterday, and after being placed on hold YET AGAIN, they confirmed that indeed they could accommodate me. I mean honestly. FIGURE YOUR SHIT OUT. 

If it were up to me, I would not have even given this restaurant my business after that experience, but the group had already collectively agreed to eat here.

Fast forward to Saturday... Our server was nice enough but his \"helpers\" were more attentive than he was, we waited forever for our drinks and dinner, one persons meal never made it out, and the food was just okay.

Overall, the experience was awful and there are so many other restaurants in Cleveland with better food and service. I will not be returning to the Burnham."}
{"text":"The Burnham Restaurant is located inside the Hilton Hotel in downtown Cleveland.

I had breakfast here one morning after staying overnight in the Hotel.

Ordered an omelette - with spinach, mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, sausage, and cheese. Plus V-8 juice, water, and coffee. Omelette was really good. I spiced it up with some Sriracha sauce.

The staff were friendly and efficient.

{"text":"The restaurant is bright and uplifting. Waiter was friendly and attentive.
We inquired as to the appetizer the table next to us received because we wanted to order it too. We were told they were hotel executives so they could order it at lunch but we were only permitted to order it at dinner."}
{"text":"Food is ok but expensive.  SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  The hotel tries to do a good job and wants to provide a great experience,  unfortunately,  the restaurant staff have poor attitudes don't really understand what good service means."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why urban farmer has better review than this place. The food was really good for a restaurant that is maintained by the hotel. I've tried 4 different meal and dessert and nothing is bad.. I'm thinking that the review is low due to price but I can assure you that the quality and freshness of the  ingredients is fantastic.. u get what u paid for. The service is not bad... just a relax environment in which u can enjoy your dinner.. I'm giving this a 4.5 star due to price but if u are looking for a quality and taste, this is definitely a must try in Cleveland..

I recommend any seafood entree.. salmon, trout and walleye.."}
{"text":"I could go on for hours about how wonderful this place and its staff are. I had the best pancakes I've ever eaten and a wonderful mimosa. We came in at noon (lunch time), and the staff happily accommodated our dying need for some breakfast food. This is a must for brunch."}
{"text":"The Burnham just opened on June 1st and we thought we'd try something new. Normally, new restaurants mess up something so our expectations were not high. Let me say this...Burnham was phenomenal and exceeded all of our expectations by leaps and bounds. I cannot wait to go back!

The decor is very modern, yet warm and inviting. The service was top notch and very friendly. We were seated next to the bar so had the chance to interact with their bartender who made the experience even better. Super friendly guy, very knowledgeable mixologist--everything he made was great. After the first round, we were letting him just give us whatever he wanted. He makes great mocktails too.

Food..OMG. I want to go back the very next day and repeat the entire experience. We ordered several small plates to start with: calamari, pierogis, and octopus. Everything was delicious and the preparations were creative and unlike what we've had at other restaurants. We especially loved the sauce on the pierogis and the octopus was so good we wound up getting another order. For dinner, we tried Oxtail, Burnham Burger, and Shrimp & Grits. Once again, everything was top notch...our plates were clean very quickly. Even the dishes we were on the fence about ordering we wound up raving about. 

The Burnham is a great addition to Cleveland downtown - we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm always a little skeptical of hotel restaurants/bars, but this one impressed me. Everything was delicious and service was great. The atmosphere is pretty decent, but the patio wasn't open yet when I was there, so I suspect that it's great. The tapas are really unique, but my husband and I opted for entrees. I did see the table next to us, ordered tapas, and they looked and smelled amazing, and we're really generous portions. My husband thought his pork entree was smaller than he wanted, but my fish was perfection. I can't wait to go back for girls' night to order a bunch of small plates!"}
{"text":"From Chicago and I'm in Cleveland for an event at the convention center..very poor customer service very slow and food takes for ever..Not worth it."}
{"text":"I came to Cleveland to watch the cavaliers, raptors game the restaurant at the hotel was the burnham restaurant, we were all trying to figure out where to eat and we pulled the menu up on our phones and we decided this place. The service was some of the best I've had, My server Jeff was a very genuine guy, I've been to many restaurants where servers are nice, but it seems like it's a forced attitude, but I could tell Jeff even outside of work acted the exact same and was a joy to be around, The food was amazing too we tried a bit of everything and had no complaints about anything. Some of the food we had was the \"soul bowl\" which was pork belly on top of mac and cheese, the chicken wings confit, hangar steak, Buffalo chicken pizza, and a burger. I would get it all again, but the steak and the pork belly was my absolute 2 favourites, you have to try it out for yourself to see why I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this spot.  Service was lackluster--food was just \"ok\".  We had a big group, and I ordered fish which came out way overdone.  Caesar salad was probably the best thing I tasted.  All in all--seemed overpriced and understaffed for a hotel experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in the Hilton Cleveland! We ordered salads and they were as good as the entrées. Huge offset bowls with enough fresh, unique ingredients (fresh, whole anchovies, pickled eggs, fresh shaved cheese) to make you think twice about ordering additional items from the menu...nah, there's more to explore! You have to try the French toast...yes, anytime of day! It's not what you think. Shredded chicken, a sauce and season combo that takes your taste buds on a roller coaster, and soft & slight crunch in the toast peeking from beneath. One of my all-time favorites!!"}
{"text":"I had the corn beef hash, mimosa, and coffee. The corn beef was way too salty. Hollandaise sauce and eggs were good but the salt level of the beef ruined the dish for me. Two other people at my table had ordered it and had said the same thing. The portion size was good enough. They didn't really come around often enough to check if we wanted refills of coffee or water. Coffee was overpriced. We had bottomless mimosas which were good except for the mango flavor (either made wrong or bad batch). The shashuka didn't have much flavor, tasted like tomato sauce and egg. Not horrible but nothing special. The sweet potato cheesecake was good but a little too sweet for me. Overall I probably would just come back if I wanted bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Nice upscale take on Cajun. Nice place for a rich dinner after a day of conference smarts. Our favorites were actually the appetizers: pierogies and the divine goat cheese creme brulee! Hanger steak was delicious and perfectly cooked, if a little salty."}
{"text":"I came here last night while on a business trip. I was not too impressed. The food was decent but the service not so much. We sat on the outdoor terrace and the waitress forgot about us. For appetizers we ordered the calamari which was light and delicious. We also had the shrimp and gnocchi (only came with 3 pieces of shrimp) and the wings which were good but nothing special. I ordered the fried chicken confit which was good but not as flavorful as I had expected. It's conveniently located in the hotel but next time I'll venture out into the city."}
{"text":"Bar Review:

I stopped in for a drink at the new Hilton bar. The bar is on the lower level of the restaurant at patio level (which should be opening soon). The bartender was really friendly and talkative and kept checking on us. 

I tried the French Toast from the small plate menu. It was a little spicy and just as good as it sounded on the menu: pulled chicken, charred cabbage, OH maple syrup. I didn't get much syrup or that breakfast French Toast flavor from the dish, but the grilled bread in and of itself was good. The extra tender fall-apart chicken though in combination with the bread was a wonderful flavor. The portion size was actually large enough for sharing.  

Upon leaving I noticed Eliot's Bar just outside of the main restaurant level was actually pretty busy. Compared to the two other people that were at the Burnham bar, Eliot's had a nice after work energy."}
{"text":"Limited menu with forgettable food and service. I expected more from a Hyatt property."}
{"text":"I can typically take or leave hotel restaurants as well, they are hotel restaurants.  Burnham is way different. 

On our last AM in town we were hitting breakfast before hitting 71 to go home. Anthony was our server. Two omelets with wheat toast, fruit for me potatoes for my BFF. Coffee. Juice. Ice Tea. 

What SOLD US and has us on Yelp and then Trip Advisor was my ask for ice water after I downed my coffee. Anthony turned around grabbed a glass, held it up and checked to make sure it was clean.  We went crazy - that NEVER happens but at the Burnham. When we praised him he said, \"I'm not gonna give out no dirty glass.\" LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When he stopped by to pick up our plates he so proudly said, \"I love picking up dirty clean plates!\" BAWHAHAHAHAHA! Just absolutely too cute.  Lots of professionalism. Lots of personality.  Quite the impression. 

The food was perfect. The omelets were not in excess. Enough eggs and stuffing of our choice to balance it all out.  What an experience.  We hit so many breakfast places in town I'm sorry we didn't do this more than once. Thank you Anthony!"}
{"text":"Friday night was relaxing with good service and delicious foods. Started with the Malibu Coconut Rum Ginger lemonade. Light and refreshing. Chose lobster bisque to start. A cup was plenty as it was thick and flavorful. The guys chose the special: 
9 oz sirloin grilled to perfection. Included the best garlic Brussels sprouts and out-of-this-world mac & cheese. Not kidding.  The ladies had the beet salad with large pieces of red and yellow beets snd shaved Comte cheese. Yum. The scallops were delicious and plenty. The octopus was fabulous hidden under arugula with fingerling potatoes covered with a light tangy sauce. So delicious. The entrees are a little pricey, but this is a Hilton venue. A meal can be made out of the soups, salads and appetizers. Recommend."}
{"text":"Co-worker went here Tuesday 1-24-17, I asked him how was it, because I knew I was to eat there Saturday with friends. His reply \"Meh - Could have been much better\"
So we when there 1-28-2017.
Had reservations, had to wait.
Service was not professional at all.
Long time waiting for drinks, and/or between drinks.
Appetizers decent.
Entrée came to table before soup.
When soup came it was cold.
For group a of 7, entrées came our separately/individually.
One person in our group didn't get the meal she ordered, and it came out so much later the rest of us were finished.
Portions small for the price.
Bills were discounted but, will not go back."}
{"text":"What a refreshing experience! Beginning with a friendly greeting and seating, followed by a delicious breakfast buffet satisfying every imaginable taste desire, and all made better by the most polite and attentive server we have experienced in a long time. Craig was a pure delight! His contribution to our dining experience was as important as the food. Craig needs to be cloned."}
