{"text":"I came here while passing by and was pleased with the service and product. This pizza shop opened up at this location about 20 years ago. They moved here after success at a location at Brimorton Rd. & Brimley Rd.  I wanted a slice of veggie pizza and thankfully they had one left. The size of the slice was huge and at a great price: $3!  The slice tasted good and had ample toppings. I didn't see as many free add-ons in the store that larger pizza chains have, but that not surprising for a 'mom & pop' shop. Also, the interior of the restaurant is dated, but it's not something I wouldn't expect in a small business in struggling Scarborough.  I'd go back here because I liked the slice and think buying local/supporting my community is important."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and I can say that this place is alright at best. The toppings don't have much flavor though the dough is quite alright. Their quick to get your pizza ready whether your getting a small, medium or large. The variety ain't to shabby for a place of it's kind and the interior decor is alright.   Not worth going to if it's out of your way, but if your close buy and only want to spend $2.50-$3.00 buy a slice, why not."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money!  They will tell you that their pizza won an award and that they have been in business for 48 years. Don't believe them.   I thought this place might be a cool find since it's run by Italians and has been around for such a long time. I didn't expect gourmet but I was hoping for authenticity and freshness, but got crappo instead of primo. The dough is flavorless and the toppings are dull. The cheese is also low quality."}
