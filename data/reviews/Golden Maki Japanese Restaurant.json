{"text":"This is a great little sushi place that I adore. The service is much more friendly then other places I've visited. 
My only complaint is it really depends on what time you go there. I went twice for lunch and wasn't as impressed as a dinner service. 
I def love the atmosphere and decor. 
*try my favourite the green dragon roll

{"text":"Change, before is good but no more. Fish not fresh and worse service. 0 star."}
{"text":"Really great sushi,  all you can eat and everything was very fresh.  The mango rolls were fantastic.  Service very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent little sushi place.  Service excellent, price is very reasonable for the bento boxes.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We've been lunching here almost every other weekend. It's one of our fave AYCE Japanese resto. The salmon, mango & avocado sushi are really good. The teryakies and soups too. Not so many choises of desserts though. But I love the green tea ice cream, my daughter loves the green tea and red bean ice cream, my husband likes the mango ice cream and my son likes the vanilla. It would be nice if they add strawberry ice cream though if thats' all they can offer for dessert."}
{"text":"A typical AYCE sushi place. Nothing special. What really bugged me was the service and attentiveness. It's a small place and when i was there, there were 3 other occupied tables.....you would expect quick attentive service especially with 2 waiters but NO don't fool yourself...the service was mediocre with no attentiveness what so ever. For $19.99 per person i expected a bit better............oh well.....live and learn."}
{"text":"The AYCE is regular price for newmarket. Compared to all other AYCE venues in Newmarket, this one has the highest quality of food. Also. Great atmosphere, newly renovated and comfortable."}
{"text":"Good quality for an AYCE and I've been to most AYCE sushi places in Newmarket. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the salad dressing... made with apples and is often \"off\".  But quality of raw fish is good and that is important in AYCE."}
{"text":"Rude staff just for walking in? We walk in for the first time and the girl server was rude from the start, we hadn't even spoken. I was visibly 9 months pregnant and she pointed at the far wall and said \"sit at the table\". No escort, no smile, just an irritated demand. The back wall was full of people who would be elbow to elbow and no way was I going to fit, so I sat at a table in the same section where I could move the chair out to fit my belly. I instantly felt hostility from the server. 

There was a male server, who was polite until the female server very obviously started yelling about us to the entire staff, then he refused to acknowledge us or talk. 

The sushi was good but the service was abhorrent:

The female server acted put out to have to serve us. Was cold and hostile for no reason, had a huge attitude. Brought me a Coke can with a straw. No glass or ice. I had to ask for a glass and she says \" You need a glass for your Coke?\" I say yes...Does she think we're at a picnic?  No ice of course or offer of any. 

I ask her about what is in a certain roll and she cuts me off before my sentence is done. I ask again and she goes \"No, this is what is in the roll\". Next time don't interrupt. Act like you aren't a completely miserable, jerk of a person. We did nothing impolite except walk in. 

Food was brought quickly, looked good, tasted good. The male server refused to acknowledge our polite thank you's with any response, which was rude, he just stood there silently. 

Plates were very quickly cleared. No offer of anything more or more drinks or water to keep us. Just \" get out\". The menu was horribly chaotic and has no sushi lunch specials. Prices were good though. 

I have a feeling someone has hired their spoilt brats to work as the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good. I am by no means a sushi expert, but the sushi was fresh and tasty. Service was fast. I went on a Sunday night. The price was in line with other AYCE places, $19.99 for dinner.  The atmosphere was fine.  One thing that I was looking forward to was unagi (eel) sushi.  They had unagi in the maki rolls, which was good, but I have had it before, grilled on rice, tied in a little bow and I enjoyed it more.  I had their dragon roll and it was great.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Me and my mom came here for lunch. The lunch is around $12 AYCE per person, which I think is a great deal.
We were seated promptly and given the menu. The menu had lots of variety of sushi and the waitress was patient in explaining the order size and what it included.

The wait for the food was very short. After we placed our order for a few rolls, they would come within 5-10 minutes.  The sushi itself is delicious, with lots of filling and not an overbearing amount of rice.

For dessert, they only have ice cream. I got the green tea ice cream, which was very good.

Overall, really great lunch spot, we will definitely be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We go for their lunch buffet all the time because it's only $12.99 and the food is amazing and service is fast!"}
{"text":"Recent trip to Golden Maki wasn't as positive as in the past. Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of their sushi but accompanied some friends for lunch. Tables didn't include wasabi or ginger, had to ask a few times. My friend asked for spicy mayo and was brought a tiny portion. Food was okay, better than usual. I think service needs an upgrade! If I'm paying $15 for a lunch I just expect better."}
{"text":"I've lived in town my whole life and been to nearly all the sushi places in the area multiple times, and this is now my regular place. Plain and simple, the quality of the food is the best here and they even have really good unique items like fish tempura, salmon belly, and maki rolls with mango. There's also something about their avocado, salmon, and spicy mayo that just makes it better than all the others that I've tried (and their green dragon roll is the best I've ever had). The service is also good too. I've been there at times when the place is completely full and the food still comes out fairly quick and nothing is forgotten unlike some other AYCE sushi restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Very happy with this find off the highway driving from Toronto to Aurora. The decor is pretty basic but the food was great. Had he all you can eat. The spicy salmon maki was especially good, one of the best I've had actually. The dragon roll was ok."}
{"text":"I feel that with all of the new AYCE Japanese restaurants popping up, this one lacks on all fronts.  It's a bit cheaper but I'd pay the extra few bucks for quality food.

I found that all of the food was either bad or average.  Nothing wowed me or was even worth ordering again.

The sushi (while beautifully present on a wooden boat!) had too much rice and the fish did not taste fresh.  This was a real big turnoff for me because the sushi is the main reason for my visit!

Most of the other items on the menu were ok.  I found their deep fried items ok but you can get better quality anywhere else.

The one good aspect was the service.  I found them to be friendly and attentive.  Played were cleared quickly, which is always appreciated.

Overall, my visit was unmemorable other than the bad sushi.  I would recommend looking for other options if you're looking for AYCE Japanese food since there are so many other places popping up."}
{"text":"Went there today, long wait for food and they also forgot what we ordered. Very very slow! We left after 1.2 hrs of ordering food for 3. Adamamee was not fresh! Sushi texture is okay not the greatest. Miso soup so salty. Server didn't even ask if I was waiting for more food or I was pleased with the food. Would not go back again"}
{"text":"This place is crap.  All the sushi is the same and tastes bland and run of the mill.  They messed up my order, sent 24 pieces of maki instead of 4 i ordered then refused to send the \"premium\" green dragon roll because i didnt finish all 24 pieces of the crappy maki.   So i wanted to leave and they charged extra for their mistake.  I took it off her tip and left - will never return."}
{"text":"I liked it. Nice staff, observant, helpful and friendly. Decent sushi. Won't call them salmon roses, more salmon buds. lol. Sashimi nice sizes. Regular sushi.  Didn't like their tempura. Love the mountain roll with salmon avocado cucumber and spicy mayo. Nice twist. Decent price for all you can eat. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Currently CLOSED for renovations. A bit disappointed, but looking forward to a new facelift"}
{"text":"Very impressed by G. Maki, man. I am used to Markham or Richmond hill's sushi places. 

The fish was fresh, I agree. The presentation was well thought out. I didn't feel like they cheated us up here, thinking that we don't know good sushi.  

They were very prompt in their services and no pressure or looming near us. The atmosphere was attractive enough, but the most important was the food which was far from disappointing. 

Hint, hint, I love sushi places where the sushi consists of big sashimi slice and smaller rice portion. Trust me, I wanted more sushi, and that means you paid for good sushi preparation."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE lunch on Saturday and for about $14 per person, it's great! The waitress there was super thoughtful and brought over toys when my 1.5 year old was a bit grouchy. He was instantly distracted. The service is fast and friendly, the food tastes amazing!

The sushi sizes were great for an all you can eat place. The sushi rice tasted perfect and I couldn't ask for a better price. Will definitely be coming back here again.

My only thing was at the end we had three hand rolls left and were so full, we just couldn't finish it. We thought we had ordered the small sushi pieces lol They wanted to charge us $3 extra for the hand rolls to take it home but we weren't interested in paying more. The waitress told us they were going to throw the rolls away if we didn't take them. It was the end of the lunch period (we left around 4) so we figured they could've made the call to just let us take the rolls home. Oh well, I guess rules are rules! I wish I had the space to finish those hand rolls"}
{"text":"I would give this place no star, but that option is not available. I'm celiac and told the server and explained how I could not have gluten as it would make me very sick.  This place doesn't even carry gluten free soya sauce.  I travel a fair bit for work and this is the first place that I encounter that doesn't have any accommodation (gluten free soya sauce).  There was an error in my order and I was served some gluten with one of the rolls. I only noticed it on the third bite. The server said there was a mistake on the menu.  I told her that I had explained to her my situation and she should have known.  Consequently, I am currently very ill and will likely be for a couple of days.
In addition,   I eat sushi on a regular basis when i travel and this is one of he worst I have had."}
{"text":"Updated Update:  Golden Maki has reopened, but now with an \"all you can eat\" sushi menu.  This is usually the nail in the coffin of a good Japanese restaurant, since the portions usually shift to a sliver of fish on a lump of rice.  I decided that for $12, I might as well try it once to be fair.  I was surprised that the food quality was still excellent, the variety quite good, and the portion sizes had me satisfied but not bloated with an excess of rice.  If you ever want to pound down a feast of sushi at a good price, the all-you-can-eat option is usually pretty bad, but Golden Maki makes it work.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wrote a previous review, but I need to change this. This place now gets a one star from me. Staff isn't friendly and doesn't talk to customers at all. And if you ask for anything they treat your simple requests (ie. Having a glass of water) as the most difficult request you could make and that you're bothering them. 
Had to ask multiple times for items we ordered 20+ minutes before that we still hasn't received. They only gave us two order sheets for 2 people, and when we asked for extras they handed us just one. We order in small batches so we don't over order and waste. But they didn't want us ordering as little we did anyways. 
They can't seem to handle a full busy restaurant, and get overwhelmed quickly. 
They avoid eye contact with customers, seems to be a way to not talk to customers. 
The only time we got speedy service was when we were paying to leave. 

I won't be returning again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Japanese and Korean inspired foods and I don't give out 5 stars easily too.
So far I have only done take out, but the times I have, I've seen at least a family there on two different days.
Not only do they have regulars, but they have great food just as well that makes me want to go back and try every single one of their dishes and I am.
I want others the enjoy eating from there or at their few tables. It's a small restaurant, but that's what makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Golden Maki for about 4 years now and have to say it's probably my favorite ayce sushi joint in Newmarket. Compared to other sushi places in the area I find the quality most consistent here. The food is always fresh and delicious, and in all the years I've been coming here the shrimp has always been cleaned properly, something that cannot be said about other ayce restaurants (I'm looking at you Cynthia's).

The price point is pretty standard I find but well worth it given all the options. A couple things to note however, the staff isn't the most friendly though I find that is common at ayce places so I don't mind much. Though it seems recently they have hired some newer more friendly people so that could change. Also it's a rather small place so do plan ahead if coming with a group.

Overall I would highly recommend Golden Maki if you're looking for good sushi in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and reasonable price! I came here with my parents last week and we left with a big smile on our face. The size of their sushi was pretty big and fresh and the prices were very reasonable. 
I would recommend all the sushi fans to try this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Favourite sushi spot in Newmarket, period.

I love love love the sushi experience here. It's average price for lunch & dinner buffet and the service is usually good. Sometimes slow during peak hours but that's reasonable when there are only two chefs. What always brings me back is the veggie options. They incorporate different flavours and sauces and try to switch up their menu from the usual run-off-the-mill sushi restaurants. The salmon is so fresh and they are skimpy on rice (but this is what I prefer). I've been to other sushi places and have been told I cannot order any more because of my left over rice, regardless if I'm willing to pay for it. Not this place! They are reasonable and are willing to make exceptions. Sashimi is cut thin so order more if you are looking for large cuts.

I would recommend the sweet potato roll, summer roll, jade roll and salmon flowers. Oh, and all of the specialty rolls."}
{"text":"This is my family's favourite sushi joint, and I don't mind it either. We go for AYCE as most options that you can get a la carte you can also get AYCE. 
I absolutely adore the \"rock and roll\" maki you can get here. It has cream cheese in it and there is just something about it! I could eat that and nothing else.
The tempura is nothing to complain about, the green tea is delightful, and overall there isn't much to complain about! It's all you really want in an AYCE sushi experience. Nice place too.
My sister loves that they have some mango roll options. On the other hand, I am not a fan of their sweet potato roll even though I usually love those, as they cover it in a sweet sauce on top.
I don't eat sashimi but the family says it fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Will give this no star. Went there to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and it was a terrible mistake. The restaurant wasn't busy at all when we arrived and it took the longest time for the food to be served. It seemed like they did it on purpose so that we would eat as little as they wanted us to. After being starved for more than 40min, the food was finally here only to found out that the food were terribly presented and the fish was not fresh at all. Only a few dishes were served from our first and last round of order. For the sake of our precious time we left with two empty stomach. Seriously never had this kind of experience with any AYCE restaurants... Definitely the worst sushi I ever had in my life. Will not come here again even if anyone paid me to."}
{"text":"Went twice with my family. The quality of the food and service was excellent both times. The fish was fresh and the rolls were delicious. Waiters frequently refilled the tea and food came quickly, things like that. The only thing that was disappointing in the second visit was that the spider roll was unavailable. I hope it's not permanent! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing AYCE. The sushi was great and then price was very reasonable. 
Not anymore! We came at lunch today and were very disappointed! The whole lunch experience took 2 hours! The restaurant wasn't even busy so I don't see an excuse for the slow service! The food took a very long time to come out, and it came out one item at a time.  
On top of everything the staff was rude! They waitresses would just look at you and fully ignore you or walk away. 
After such a poor experience I would defiantly not return if service stays this way. Although the price is great, I'd rather pay a little more for good service"}
{"text":"First time I have tried this sushi place in Newmarket.  I was having a dinner party so decided to order a sushi platter for take out.  I ordered the Maki Plater A and it was a hit!  Fresh and delicious!  Will definitely be back."}
