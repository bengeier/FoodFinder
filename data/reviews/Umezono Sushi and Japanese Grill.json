{"text":"This place just opened and I was driving by and decided to try it out and I love it. I got the tiger roll, the yellowtail lovers roll and the Hawaiian roll and it was so good. My server was so kind to me and I wouldn't mind coming back!"}
{"text":"I really like this new Japanese cafe right outside South Summerlin. We took our out-of-town friend for dinner recently; and were very satisfied w/ the food & Service. We tried the Tonkatsu ramen, pork katsu curry with rice, a variety of yakitori, gyoza, and takoyaki, all of which were delicious & fresh.   I am definitely going to return in the near future. The only constructive criticism I have is the cooking smell in the restaurant due to open kitchen design. Maybe I'll order take-out next time to bypass the smell. :)"}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes!!! Ordered in and everything was smooth as butter from the minute they answered the phone. Incredible ordering experience, oddly enough a commodity, got there and the staff greeted and brought me food right away, clean very comfortable space.   The salmon and yellowtail nigiri were thick pieces of super fresh fish. Lemon salmon roll was really good as well, especially for someone who is pretty picky about their crab flavor.   So excited this place is behind the house, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation.   We ordered the pork belly yakitori, tuna poke, snapper carpaccio, and tonkatsu ramen.   This resto has some very solid choices. The fish quality here is great. I loved the freshness of the snapper and the tuna.    The ramen was rich and came with some tender pork slices. The broth was so good I slurped it all up! The soft boiled egg was nice and creamy.    And last but not least, the pork belly yakitori was so delicious. It melted in my mouth.    Definitely would come back when I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Place is new so you can expect that they are still working some kinks out. Thus the 4 stars.  Last time I was there, they're still in the process of getting their alcohol license. So no beer in the meantime.  Other than that, the food is really good. Their Yakitori is tasty and their appetizers have good prices and portions. And the place is in Summerlin too. If you want a good sit-down Japanese place, you got it here."}
{"text":"Went there to pick up my to go.. the sashimii was soo good and fresh.. the rolls prtty good too.. everything was excellent.. the worker there also really nice. Im sure this place would peak up later.. i would comeback to try their yakitori.. and bring my family there.."}
{"text":"Nice new spot. I originally came here to try the ramen and ended up also getting a Tiger Roll. Staff are super nice.   Ramen was small in portion. Smaller than I am used to at other establishments. The Tonkatsu ramen comes with half an egg, and 2 pieces of Chashu. The egg was yummy. Wish they gave you a whole egg though. Chashu was tasty but not as delicate as other places. The broth was just okay. I'm used to a Tonkatsu broth being thick and fatty/flavorful. While it tasted good for American tatse buds this white-wish-she-was-born-Japanese girl perfers a more traditional broth.  The tiger roll surprised me when it came out as it had a mayo/secret sauce on it which I am not used to. I'm not a mayo type of girl. But it was really good anyhow.   Chef offered me a sample of a seared fish but I had to decline due to personal preferences. We even got to talking about other sushi chefs he knows in town that the owner speaks highly of.   Defiantly recommend this place if you live in the area. I do not but I'm not against coming back and trying it again."}
{"text":"If you guys rate looking for yakitori in the afternoon, here is the place to come, especially since most izakaya places don't open until dinner time. The service is good as well as the food. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My wife picked this place. The food was pretty damn. The service is a whole different story. I don't know where the high ratings on this garbage place is coming from. We ordered our food it came out at different times one kid ate then the other then my wife then me but before anything even started coming out it took about 40 minutes or so. It wasn't even that busy like not busy at all. I don't even know what the hell to say about this place beside the food was good and it has some sorry ass service. It also took another 20 minutes to get my damn card back after the lady who I'm assuming is the owner took my payment. What a waste of time. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"A long overdue review, but all I really have to say is that it's a wonderful and cute restaurant. Came here with my uncle and cousin while we were on vacation and it was around the time it first opened. Very clean and the staff was friendly! We had a wonderful server, but I never got her name, or I can't remember since it's been so long. She was very sweet and even chased after us when we were almost driving away when my cousin left her debit card by accident. Delicious food and wonderful service!! Would definitely come back if I'm ever in town again!"}
{"text":"This place was great! What a great menu they have. There's everything from sushi, ramen, curry, grilled fish & yakitori. Everything tasted amazing. It was a bit slow when we visited tonight we were the only ones there but as we were leaving 3 more tables came in. We started with salmon Skin salad (yummy) & a spread of skewers Chicken Skin -nice & crispy, chicken liver with sauce, pork belly was a tad dry, chicken gizzard, eggplant, kuroboto sausages these were all great! We also ordered the Chirashi Don- fish tasted fresh the rice was a little soggy and undercooked. The Signature roll was great  They don't have a liquor license yet tho.  My husband wanted beer with his yakitori the server said they will get it in July. All in all this place was great just a few tweaks and they will be a perfect 5! They just opened so give me a break!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome. A great place  to come with family and friends.. we came here for EDC weekend. And we found this place because yelp send me notifications new place just open. I tried ultimate umezono roll , Tonkatsu ramen, Salmon ceviche and Yakitory .. the quality fish they provide is over the top and they have amazing customer service. The sauce for yakitory is really Bomb.. Definitely we will coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars for service 4 stars for sushi( had chefs sashimi platter) 3 stars for yakatori. Not close to Tokyo quality  3 1/2 stars for decor. Casual and clean"}
{"text":"We were visiting from CA. Stayed in Siena and visited our parents. And we saw there was a newly open Japanese restaurant right in our area. We went there with family to try them on. And you know what, we loved this place. The foods were awesome. They have sushi, rolls, ramen, and also yakitori (omg we love yakitori!!) The place was quite modern and the employees were friendly. We totally recommend this place. When we come back to Vegas, we definitely will visit this place again! I guess since they're not busy yet cuz' they're still new so this is the best time to go there!! Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Service is prompt and good. Food was of good quality. Cuts on the sushi were thick and larger than most places. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food great service  Love their skewers and price is reasonable  Definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good.  Hot dishes were hot and cold dishes were cold.  Everything had great flavor and came out in great time.  I always order skewers first since most skewer places they take the longest.  We got a few sushi rolls and skewers.  Just so good!"}
{"text":"Service was the best so far. I have been to this place 3 times already. And today we came here to celebrate my wifes birthday. Our server made something special for her.. we order ebi fry (must try) it was a humongous ebi fry- a world record size jumbo deep fried shrimp. It was seriously as long as her arm lol. Never seen shrimp like that..But we forgot to take a picture.  The sashimi was amazing and we ventured into the yakitori as well, we were not disappointed. We try oysters shooters, tasted very fresh!! Sea urchin also tasted amazing.  I think we just found out our new weekly restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was ok not fantastic. Took way too long to get our food and even longer to have them bring our card back with the receipt. It wasn't very crowded so there wasn't really a reason for them to take as long as they did. I didn't want to take pictures because it wasn't all that exciting. Kind of disappointed because I was excited about trying it based on the reviews."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place tonight instead of our usual sushi place and it definitely did not disappoint! The quality of the food was wonderful and the service was tops. I had never had a better salmon teriyaki plate ever! The salmon was perfectly cooked - soft and juicy meat with a perfectly salty/crispy skin. Our server's customer service skills alone would warrant a second visit from us because she was so friendly and attentive to our needs. Definitely give this place a try! The ambiance, the menu, and the staff all make it a nice place to even just hang out with your friends at to chat, have a few appetizers, and enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"LITERALLY SHOOK. The quality of the fish was top notch- SO FRESH. Service was paced perfectly, we didn't feel rushed or that we were ever waiting for something. Service was also on point, never had empty drinks or dishes on the table. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! I 120% will be going back."}
{"text":"When I think of izakaya, I think of a Japanese bar that serves bar food. Walking into this restaurant felt like walking into a breakfast cafe. The decor, seating, tables, lighting...   Food was okay. IMO - Izakaya Go is the best spot in Vegas.   Prices were reasonable but I'd rather pay a little more and get a better dining experience.   Might be back for lunch, but the vibe was terrible for a dinner or late night option."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and they offered a great deal for their lunch specials.  Generous portions & wonderful service.  Will return to try it out for dinner soon."}
{"text":"This is a good place for sushi and small tapas japanese dishes. Their sashimi is fresh and skewers are amazingggg !!!! Must try"}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas last week since my cousins came from HK and they wanted to visit Vegas because they have friends who live in Spring Valley. We ended stay at the strip but have to meet up somewhere around their friends area, so we choose the place. I am kind a \"foodie\" from yelp and I usually go to the place by nice pic and good reviews and something hot n new! Then we saw this Japanese resto, at first I wasn't sure to try this place since there is so many other places..but..this place is closest one :p  Then we ended to go to this place. The food actually was great, I like their takoyaki and spicy tuna roll. One of cousin love their roll with albacore and crispy onion on top..it was yummy crunchy crispy! And the other one love their sashimi since he's a sashimi lovers..the sashimi was fresh and delicious    The price : reasonable   The place is clean, the ambience was ok and the service was great. Should give a shot when u around this area!"}
{"text":"Very delicious.... Chirashi was fresh, Tonkasu ramen is a must. Teriyaki for the kids comes with miso soup and salad too. Nuff said"}
{"text":"Five stars for High quality fishes for sashimi, light & crispy tempura, beautiful presentation, excellent services in very reasonable price"}
{"text":"This review is few weeks late, but i just saw the picture in my phone that i look from this dinner at umeznono and i had to write this review.  Dinner was AMAZING !! Service/Server ware fantastic. We set at the bar and saw the ceff cook the food, they were perfectly prepared all the dish!   The nigiri was really fresh and tasty as well. Tempura udon tasted yummy. Also we order Salmon dinner and ika yaki-grilled whole squid , and Screming O.  Food is worth every single penny.."}
{"text":"Very clean and organized. The rolls were very good. Love the Shoyu Ramen not too oily but unctuous enough, and with perfectly cooked egg with it. My daughter loves Chirachi Don except the tamago, and server told us next time to let  them know and will replace it with something she prefers."}
{"text":"Great place to try something new. Quality food and good services, not like AYCE places in town. Everything tasted fresh. Highly recommend to try their skewers and chicken teriyaki !!!!"}
{"text":"Really, really good. Only way to describe our experience here. Yakitori was really excellent..pork belly and shitaki mushroom were so good. Agedashi was really good...they used firm tofu which had a great texture. Saba Shioyaki was perfect...not oily and perfect saltiness. Loved the sashimi by the piece on the menu...yellow tail was melt in your mouth tender. Nice surprise at the end....brought us a choc mousse in a terra cotta pot with shovels. Was really fun!"}
{"text":"Great value. There aren't too many Yakitori places in the area so it's nice to have one open up. I'd say the good is descent. Nothing to crave for that's why I say it's great value since the prices are fair. Great service and great location. I'll be back next time I'm in area."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Vegas last month for her birthday. Since she loves Asian food, we found this place based on good Yelp reviews.  The place is new, clean and the food we ordered was fantastic! My wife was really happy and enjoyed it. We highly recommend this place if you like Asian food.  My wife ordered salmon teriyaki, ika yaki (grill squid) and mango salmon ceviche.  All the food is really good."}
{"text":"The freshest most delicious sushi I have had!!! And I eat a lot of sushi. Nice staff. Just great all around try it you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Japan .....needless to say I love and enjoy Japanese cuisine.   The yakitori items are wonderful and I could sit at the counter for hours ordering one after another.   Tonight I ordered chicken, negima, eggplant,and kurobuta sausage.  Absolutely delicious right off the grill.  Next the Ebi fry and croquette was perfectly deep fried.  I had to leave some room to sample their sushi and boy am I glad.....the quality and thickness of the tuna, yellowtail and salmon were some of the best I've had.  Looks like it's going to be a regular hangout for me."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Rolls were fresh and plentiful. Service was too notch. Our server even gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse dessert. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"its was such a good decision to come to this japanese restaurant!! They environment in the restaurant is relaxing and the service is a good and efficient. They sale japanese skewers with homemade special sause.. the price is really cheap if you compare to other place.. also they have a lunch special , for combo only 7-10$. Well... the price is reasonable . Definitely we will coming back!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!! The service and food was amazing!! Not to mention, at a very reasonable price!!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful.  First the service was great.   They were very attentive and welcoming.  The food was excellent too.   We had two rolls.  Both were very tasty and fresh.  The salmon nigiri was also very fresh and delicious.  Had their version of shrimp tempura.  It's a very crunchy large shrimp.  Was excellent.  The poke salad was also fresh and tasty.  The price is also very reasonable.  Will be back.   The only thing is no liquor license yet.  Hopefully they will get their liquor license soon.   However the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Walked here from a nearby time share for lunch and we were very pleased with the service and fresh fish. Worth trying!!"}
{"text":"Try this new place it's very good had Agedashi Tufo, Ten Zaru Soba was serve the right way dipping sauce with raw quail egg, Salmon Sashimi very fresh and Beef Ribeye was really good also tried their Ultimate Umezono special roll again it was good. Chef Ben had me tried Chicken meatball and he's right it's good Ben was very polite good conversation on the counter. Place clean I say this is one of those Japanese tapa sushi and noodle place. Good eats."}
{"text":"It all began when i was craving sushi on my bed in my Vegas hotel! I called up my friend and asked where i can get best sushi here in Vegas. She recommended me to go here at Umezono Sushi. She told me how fresh the fish are, how good the teriyaki and the yakitori are, how friendly the staffs and chefs are, how quickly the services are, and how satisfied she was when she came here last time she was in Vegas.   So, what else can i say? I was sold and decided to give this place a try. I came in and made to go order. The place is really clean and has an inviting vibe to it. I looked at the menu and got Teriyaki, Yakitori and sushi. My order was ready and done within 15 mins. I was pretty surprised on how fast the service was. My food was made fresh and right in front of my eyes.  Everything that my friend said did not fall short. I did not have to turn in to a CRAZY HANGRY woman that day. I was hungry, got my food, left, ate some good food and VERY SATISFIED! :)   I ordered: Salmon Teriyaki, Bacon Scallop Yakitori, Yellowtail Lover Sushi, and Ultimate Umezono Sushi  (All for me) jk ;P i was nice enough to share this heavenly good food w my friend.   THANK YOU SO MUCH UMEZONO SUSHI!  You saved me and my friend from hunger and satisfied my cravings.  Definitely coming back for more the next time i visit Vegas again :D  #LoveInFirstBite"}
{"text":"This place is good as it can be. My friend recommended this place when I was visiting Vegas on Memorial day weekend. They have varieties of Japanese food starting from ramen, sushi, yakitori, bentos, etc. I ordered a little bit of everything. Tonkatsu Ramen was(unexpectedly) a bomb. Usually I ordered a ramen from a ramen place but I was craving some soup so I ordered one from here and it was so good passed my expectations. Other than than, fish was fresh, big fish for Nigiris. Yakitori(skewers) were tender and juicy. Highly recommend this place if you are craving Japanese food. Friendly service and easy parking too."}
{"text":"Umezono is worth trying if you go to vegas.  Iya located in the west tropicana.  Its pretty much sushi and yakitory.   Price reasonable if you compare to kyara or ichiza , i rather choose umezono.  Price way more cheaper and i love the yakitory sauce.. not to salt and perfect taste.   What i can say great food and awesome service. Tonkatsu ramen really tasty. No regret for any dish we tried. We order chicken heart, chicken gizzard, chicken skin , really delicious, very crispy (must try)"}
{"text":"Excellent. This is among the best sushi bars in Las Vegas.  Sushi Score based on 2 visits Freshness 4.5/5 Special Rolls 2/5 Sushi Value 5/5 Sushi Overall 5/5"}
{"text":"great server! not a big fan of ayce, freshness of sashmi was beyond my expectation for reasonable price. will go back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jem. They just recently opened, so there aren't many people in the restaurant. The food and service is great. We had skewers: gizzard, heart, okura wrapped in bacon, chicken skin. The tempura udon and the ultimate umezono roll were all good. You have to also try the hamachi (yellowtail) collar. It is very limited in quantity so get it while you can."}
{"text":"Wow.  I don't need to finish my meal to begin saying that this place is hands down amazing.  Quality. Quality. Quality.  I was skeptical at first seeing that it is new.  But the reviews don't lie.  The fish is fresh, the ramen is top notch, and the service is good too.  I've never seen my girlfriend go this crazy over how amazing she thinks the food is.  The ramen beat her favorite ramen spot (monta) The chashu in the ramen is grilled to perfection.  There's so many good things I can say about this place.  The only downfall is, it's in a random spot. And I wish it was closer to us!  But wow.  This place is one to try. And one to go out of your way for.  Yes.  Hands down. Coming back. Yes please.  With how great this place, I hope their popularity doesn't take down the quality. Cause oh man. So good.  I'm not even making sense.  Alright. Here's some photos"}
{"text":"Seriously?! WTF is this place?! The broth of their Ramen tasted like old meat that's been sitting in the freezer for a while, boiled it, and then served it. The sushi's flavors are inconsistent and fish did NOT taste fresh at all.   The service is horrible! It took an hour before we got all our food. I came out of this place still hungry and sooo disappointed! Never going back.   Yelpers beware!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great, as well as the service. Very friendly waitress, and some of my favorite anime music on the speakers. Reasonable prices as well. Recommended"}
{"text":"I was so hungry and just found out new open restaurant, Umezono sushi and grill. It was very simple casual restaurant and clean place. Server was so friendly and food was very fresh and good tastes. Definitely I will be back later."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Amazing sushi rolls! Very close knit sushi restaurant with super nice staff & amazing sushi chefs. I got the double shrimp roll & the Hawaiian. Very good! Don't sleep on this place!"}
{"text":"New Japanese place closer to Summerlin....yay!  Our go to izakaya is usually Kyara but this place definitely comes close with quality food for a reasonable price.  Legit takoyaki is usually a benchmark for the rest of the food for us.  The takoyaki was crisp on the outside and the octopus was cooked perfectly inside. I hate soggy takoyaki. Our 2 year old devoured two of these on her own and we ended up adding another order. The takoyaki is also a generous size and comparable to the quality at Kyara, Jinya, and Monzo.  I was a little skeptical about the ramen, someone compared it to Monta....  While not exactly Monta quality, it was really good given this place is not noted to be a ramen spot.  The chashu was tender and flavorful, as well as the broth.  We also tried the chicken gizzard, chicken skin, ribeye, kurobuta sausage, and pork belly yakitori.  The skewers were decent but not the best in town...but I also said this about Kyara when they first opened, so always room to improve.  The skewers were a tad too oily and the chicken skin was still chewy and not crispy. The gizzard was done well and you can never go wrong with kurobuta sausage. We also tried the mango salmon ceviche, this was very light and refreshing.  Maybe I'm use to other places serving ceviche with some sort of chips, it was missing a crunchy element for me.  The place is relatively small but we will definitely be back to try more of the items.  If you work around here, I noticed they have a lunch menu that is really reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"There is some terrific value to be had at the newest neighborhood Japanese restaurant!  They do a good job covering all the izakaya bases and I was pleasantly surprised.    Right off the bat, order the yakitori before deciding on the rest of the meal.  They take a bit of time and the skewers arrive at the table kind of haphazardly.  Standouts were bacon scallop with salt ($2.50), pork belly with sauce ($2.25) and chicken skin with salt ($2.25), the latter not being for everyone (or anyone else at the table), but damn good.   Although they offer many popular LV AYCE type sushi rolls, the best bet would be the \"Sashimi Combo\", which features 18 pretty thick cuts at $29.95 (tuna, salmon, tuna tataki, octopus, scallop and yellowtail) or if it's just two people, share the \"Chirashi Don\" with 12 pieces of sashimi on sushi rice.  Both of these beat the heck out of anything with imitation crab or spicy fish.               The \"Hamachi Kama\" was my favorite item of the night.  At only $8.95, it was everything I had hoped for with a delightfully crisp outer skin and juicy, meaty center.  This should be ordered pretty soon as well since there is limited supply of these per day.  They did run out of \"Salmon Kama\", but more than made up for it with stellar pieces of grilled salmon belly instead.  Lunch specials and ramen look interesting and will be items I'll definitely try soon.  I also can't wait until they get a liquor license for a more complete meal.    3.7721839472674763 stars!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Japanese restaurant.  Very friendly service, fresh food and sushi, some traditional Japanese dishes not commonly found in average Japanese restaurants.  Prices very reasonable.  Great for the whole family."}
{"text":"Amazing quality sushi and even better lunch deals! Cant beat the lunch specials for japanese food. I stop in for lunch all the time and enjoy dinner here too. Try the chocolate mousse too! Great new spot in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Loved the skewers and sashimi combo. Everything tasted fresh, properly prepared, and reasonably priced. Friendly and fast service !"}
