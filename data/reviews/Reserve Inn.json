{"text":"The Reserve Inn has been a Hudson staple since before I was even a little kid, visiting my grandparents who lived right up the street.  Had a chance to swing by on a business trip last month.  Just fantastic!  I would highly recommend The Reserve Inn if you are in the Hudson area!"}
{"text":"The new chef has taken the food to a whole new level. Bravo. The classics are still there, like the Leo Salad, but the new items are certainly worth a try. The short rib and the fried chicken are both the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"After years of my parents saying this is a great place, I felt compelled to sign up on Yelp to write about my disappointment.  Onion rings were prohibitively salty, and my squash ravioli was bland with hyper-salty leaks and burnt walnuts.  The head chef came by to ask how things were, but after we let him know he didn't feel the need to make anything right, just to talk to 'his guys'.    The place carries itself (and charges like) a nicer place in a big city, but the experience was anything but."}
{"text":"I find it interesting how many servers they have gone through over the last 8 months. And when a server actually quits due to the fact that the owners girlfriend cuts their hours back to nothing because she is such a control freak, that they tell all the customers that she was fired. And what happened to Loretta, a 40 year employee? She didn't quit or retire as the owners would have you believe, she was fired by Diane.  And as far as the Menu the so called Chef they hired, he isn't nor has ever been a chef, he worked in a kitchen for a chef. He's trying but not really getting it. Who wants Corn Bread instead of a roll with their dinner and that is just a VERY small example! Dry Ravioli, how can that dish be dry? He has a few good items, most carried over from the previous chef.  And what owner doesn't have a GM, they let the chef/cook be the GM? I give them about a year and they will be closed. Ask yourself this, is it hard to get a reservation there?"}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan and patron of the Reserve Inn.  In spite of the fact that they have undergone a lot of changes in the last few years, they still offers a great (and usually consistent) meal.  Stick with the old standbys- pork chops, steaks, Leo Salad...they are great on those for the most part---but they don't do trendy quite as well.  And- skip the tobacco onions- they are always ice cold!"}
{"text":"Great Steakhouse in the heart of downtown Hudson, Ohio. This place gets pretty packed. They have awesome steaks and other meat options. The meal is delicious and the service is awesome. The meals get a little pricey but that is because you are getting a quality meal with a salad and a side to go with your meat selection. The outside of the restaurant reminds me of an older style Restaurant."}
