{"text":"Excellent Thai food ! I just discovered this place. Good service. I recommend the pad sew and pad Thai"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewers so far: this is pretty great fast food, and really friendly service. But I have to disagree on the speed, it was really slow for me. I went in towards the end of lunch and there were a couple of people waiting for their orders. It seems the person doing the cooking was in training, so I'll cut them some slack but it really shouldn't take 15 minutes to prep a few orders. 

I had a chicken pad Thai, and as far as fast food goes it was good! Lots of chicken pieces and a few fried tofu bits and veggies. They made sure to ask if I wanted hot sauce, and a bunch swirled in was just perfect. 

The location is pretty convenient, at the corner of Sherbrooke and St Denis, a block from the Sherbrooke metro. I was transferring from the 144 to the 24 bus, so it was easy to stop in while transferring. I got takeout, but I would be tempted to eat in, the space looked really pretty and they seem to use real dishes for eat in orders."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ! On a pris l'Udon Sauté avec tofu et la pad Thai aux crevettes. Les deux était délicieux ! Plein de saveur, une bonne sauce pour tout envelopper. Je commanderai sûrement de nouveau."}
{"text":"Fairly confident anyone who has said this place is tasty haven't tried actual Thai food before."}
{"text":"The service is great! It was fast and the server was really nice! 

It's my 2nd time eating Pad Thai! I thought it was great :) It was cheap given the serving size. I'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the place I always seem to be attracted to whenever Im in the area.The food is tasty but you will wait for it being that its cooked to order.The last time I was there I waited about ten minutes for my food.When the order was up and ready to be dressed with veggies the young lady in front was to busy texting to work.I had a ride waiting and had to rush her along at doing her JOB!Other then that..tasty meals."}
{"text":"It was really delicious and cheap. The staff are really nice and friendly. They can speak english and spanish. When I'll visit Montreal I'll come back this place."}
{"text":"We ordered our meal for 5 right before 9:00 pm and waited until 10:00 pm. Upon calling at 10:00 we were told that our delivery had already left and would be there soon. At 10:30 pm I called again to be told that our order wasn't even made as they were out of cashews, which was in two items we'd ordered. Next, the woman on the phone told us that Bangkok Express in Monkland would have everything we'd want. One of the worst customer experiences I've ever had in Montréal."}
{"text":"So this is a fast Asian food joint that I discovered last week. I have to be honest, I wasn't very keen on going there as I'm not a big fan of places \"express-something\". However, the guy who works there was super friendly and he convinced us to try one of their soups. And wow, it was the best $10 I have ever spent on a soup.

This is definitely a place to remember if you're in a hurry and crave something delicious and spicy. Their prices are under $10 and maybe a little bit over for other dishes, so if you're on a budget it's a perfect place to get good quality fast Asian food in less than 10 minutes time."}
