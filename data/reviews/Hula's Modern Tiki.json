{"text":"I've driven past this place so many times without going inside. Had dinner there with a group of friends and it was awesome. A little chilly if yo have to sit outside but luckily they have a nice fire pit. Food was excellent, will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recent Saturday night with friends. Hubby and I have been before and loved it! Service was good but the food was sub par this time. For some reason 2 of the 4 meals could not arrive hot. We sent the 2 cold meals back and received cold meals again! The manager was quick to adjust our meals but it didn't fix our experience."}
{"text":"I really want to try this place out again but I haven't worked up the courage to do so. My husband and I went for a date night and ordered the lobster bisque and a burger. We were very pleased and excited that we had found this gem! The next day while looking through Phoenix Health inspections, we were mortified to see Hulas for uncleanliness. The inspection was specific that multiple roaches were found in the bar area and unsafe food temps. I get very picky when it comes to raw foods and uncleanliness. From what I observed, everything looked AMAZING however I can't help but think about their health code violations. Maybe next time I go, I should ask for their restaurant grade!
If you don't believe me here is their health/inspection report! They were graded with a D 
UPDATE: I received a response from the owner and was informed that since the previous inspection, new rules/regulations and positions have taken place to make sure their restaurant rules are up to par. Maybe I might make my way over sometime this week and try the poki! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Hula's several times for drinks, but went today for lunch. It was freaking AWESOME. I had the Big Sur Black Bean Burger and my husband got the Hula Burger. Both were delicious and one of the best burgers we have had in a long time. The service was excellent!! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Simply delightful. The hip interior is themed (of course),  but without overkill. I love the unique L-shape building structure that opens up to the patio and fire pit. Large rolling doors open the entire inside- making you feel as though you're actually sitting outside. The staff is friendly, crowd ecclectic. They have great happy hour specials- especially the tofu street tacos and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"best food ive had so far in Phoenix everything was spot on service was great drinks rocked and the jerk chicken was amazing. will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"The jungle curry rice bowl is absolutely delicious. Actually all of their rice bowls are great. Also love their tacos, veggie burger, sweet potato fries and all of their tropical drinks."}
{"text":"went on a Thursday evening with the BF and a couple new friends. REALLY like the decor - it's simple and linear and truly avoids the overdone \"kitschy\" thing. I especially love the shelves in the dining room lined with mini tiki heads.

Our server, a blonde gentleman, was attentive and very friendly throughout. Cool guy.

I had two martinis - the blood Orange martinis. they were good, but they had actual chewable chunks of ice floating on top - which is really unusual for a martini. Maybe I was more worried about being caught chewing ice and having someone across the dining room think \"Geez that guy is sexually frustrated\".

We ordered and enjoyed both the tuna poke (nice portion) and i think the fish tartar with these really great crisps that accompanied them.

Din din? I had Tuna steak in lemongrass. Though the taste was good, the temp was so-so. A little on the medium to cold side. Also - for the price you pay, rice and a small lump of coleslaw don't cut it with me. They need to amp up the sides a bit.

WARNING: SUPER PICKY MOMENT!
If you're gonna have a carefully thought out restaurant like this with good design and an urban feel, PLEASE make your staff dresscode at least a half notch above \"jeans and a black t-shirt with the restaurant name screenprinted on it\". We can get this in nearly every casual restaurant in Phoenix, and it's a really tired look. It's like at Pita Jungle where the servers don't even wear aprons with their street clothes. They might as well be grungy ASU students that are getting initiated and have to serve lunch for a day as part of it. Looks sloppy, feels sloppy. It's sloppy.

Get a little more 'umph' behind your side dishes, and you may be able to stay on the map for some time!

i will return"}
{"text":"Yep, Hula's is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Totally awesome menu, great service, and great tropical drinks - even for people like me who hate tropical drinks.  Seriously, get over to Hula's right now and have a Mai Tai.

Tiki Time at Hula's is great, with $5 drink specials and food specials during the week.  Plus, how much better does Tiki Time sound than Happy Hour?  You can get that anywhere.

The salads are worth skipping, but everything else on the menu is outstanding.  If you're feeling healthy-ish, grab the black bean burger.  It's better than most hamburgers.  And of course get the sweet potato fries.

Other menu favorites are the spicy edamame appetizer, mac and cheese, and the Jawaiian Jerk Pork plate.  Save some of your diabetes for the coconut banana cream pie.

Whenever the weather permits, be sure to sit on the patio.  Warning - it will be hard to leave.  And if it starts to get chilly, snag a spot by the firepit.  Or just up at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been very fortunate to have this place close by. I have taken many boyfriends, friends and relatives here, and we all agree that Hula has amazing food; a chill, generous and attentive staff; and a fun, casual vibe. The restaurant is very open to the outside with some of the walls removed, and there's a fire pit to keep dinner cozy on those chilly nights. Hula's is dog friendly and right next door to Twirl, a highly reviewed froyo joint (in case you want a light dessert to follow). 

I am not a fan of Bloody Mary's, and my boyfriend hates anything without meat, yet I really enjoyed their B.M., and he always ends up asking for \"a couple\" bites of my black bean burger. They got us both addicted."}
{"text":"What a find!!!  

We went there for lunch on a Saturday, and normally I don't really go \"all out\" in the middle of the day.  This really was no exception.  I tried to keep it light, but even the light side was out of this Frickin world!  

First of all, the atmosphere is awesome.  It truly is.  It is like an ultra modern Palapa.  I must've spelled that wrong because I got a red squiggly line under it, but you know what I mean.  The vibe was very cool.  Sort of Zen and the porch was part of the bar area and vice-versa.  There was a good crowd and everybody seemed to be having fun.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and just as described it was \"heaven on a bun\".  My girlfriend ordered fish tacos that she raved about.  Sweet potato fries were killer.  

We sat at a community table because it seemed like the happiest place to be.  Down the table some people ordered the scorpion drink which was like a mai tai with 10 straws.  It was huge and didnt seem overpriced...especially when I saw the happy hour menu.  

There were a ton of things on the menu that Ive gotta try for dinner one night soon.  Everything seemed so yummy.  Service was really friendly too.  

I am dying to do happy hour here.  The bar area seems awesome!!!

Gotta  check this place out!"}
{"text":"Makes me want to time travel back to the 60's and sip tropical cocktails overlooking a volcano.  Hula's has to be in one of the most unique buildings in Phoenix.  I recommend sitting at the bar to check out all the memorabilia exploding from every crevice. 

Our bartender was jovial and uniquely looked like the Mayhem guy from the All State commercials.  Very fresh ingredients and the Sweet Potato Fries are banging.   

There are a variety of house cocktails and I stumbled out a Tiki Bastard!  Gin is my new poison."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, nice servers, sweet decor, decent (emphasis on decent, not oh-my-god-I-was-totally-blown-away!) food. Not amazing. But worth a trip to see and be seen :) Sit at the bar and it will make you feel hip."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. We enjoyed many menu item and they were all delicious. The cocktails are out of this world."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing! I come here for their tacos. Short Ribs are pretty on point as well. Their drinks are OK if you don't mind rum and sweeter drinks, I'm not so into Rum, so I guess I'm SOL there. But they have an ok beer selection and wine available as well so there are other options too. Finish with a side of plantains for dessert,  trust me, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Oh Hulas Happy Hour! How I love thee!!!

John you make the best libations! I love your conversation and recommendations for food and drinks. Happy hour appetizers and drinks are amazing! The artwork and atmosphere fantastic! Think Mid Century Modern Tiki Outsider Pin Up art  - tiki mug collection is Fab! Love the large screen playing old beach movies too. I also enjoy looking at the ornate detail to the chapel across the street out of your BIG window facing Central. The outdoor patio is spacious and always seems to be being used winter or summer with the help of heaters or misters depending on the season. Staff is attractive, helpful and polite.

Your are close to my house for a reason - we searched close to you and many of our other favorite spots!!!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific place to get drinks and a bite to eat.   It's perfect for social events like happy hour or a date, or just to chill and watch people.  Strong drinks.  Awesome poke."}
{"text":"Hula fits into the cool vibe of uptown Phoenix.  I really like the vibe of the area and Hula seems to be a good fit.  If you can and it is not June and 176 degrees, get a good seat outside and enjoy.  Inside is a very modern tiki style (not sure, but I think I just made up a new style, but I think it fits this place).

Overall our experience was pretty good.  They have one of the best veggie burgers in Phx.  The sweet potato fries are a nice touch to any meal on the list.  The mai tai was very good and made me wish I was in Maui!

The only issue we had was minor.  Our waiter did bring us pork and before we could get the right meal he was off and I had to track him down and it took a bit to get it fixed.  That happens time to time and I will not let that cloud my judgement of the place - it is still fitting as a 3 star. 

I like the area and the busy atmosphere is great on a Friday or Saturday night.  We will be back, especially for another Veggie Burger!"}
{"text":"When you take a look at a place like Hula's and see that it has eighty-eight reviews it makes you think, does it really matter if I put in my two cents? Well maybe Hula's doesn't need my cents, but they are well deserving of five stars and a few dollars. 

I am not a huge Yelper. Okay scratch that. I am a huge Yelper but not a very good one.  I love looking at the events and use it to gage the places I venture to, but you will never find me on a forum and rarely writing a review. I decided that Hula's was worth that rare occasion. 

Like I said I am a fan of the Events page so I decided to try out Yesterday's Urban Wine Walk. I'll admit that the walk turned out to be a bust for my friend and I (for reasons of timing not event qualms) but Hula's was the best part and made the walk attempt worthwhile. The wine was great and our friendly server was more than willing to describe the options and chat about a great place to find a good Malbec. Thanks for the tip. My favorite wine was the Carmenere they were offering. My friend was a fan of the Fume Blanc.  The only thing we had time for was a starter and we went with the spicy Thai fish cakes, which were amazing. Perfect size and flavor and presented as if it was the after shot for a cooking demo. I have been wanting to try Hula's since they opened and I am willing to admit that the walk was my excuse to get down there. Now I know there is no excuse needed and I will definitely be heading back down for a full dining experience very soon. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I was there Wed nite. I was with the party of 5, and I concur, it was NOT a good meal for any of us. Giving credit were I can, the ceviche, sweet potato fries and shrimp rolls were good. Other than that, the service was mediocre, the ginger in the cole slaw created  a bitter flavor, the sticky rice was not hot and had an added spice that none of us could name, and my pulled pork plate was just plain awful. The meat was smelly and tasted musty. I'll let our other guests describe their own dishes. As for Tracy D, we are NOT snowbirds, rather we have lived here for over 40 years...raised here, and own & run businesses here. We all dine out frequently! I think your comments to Patti S were pretty rude. A review of a restaurant is NOT a personal attack. Yelp was created for us ALL to voice our opinons. A bad dining experience happens. Unfotunately, this was one of those."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and had a very good experience.  Hangover hash is delicious, but make sure to get the hash extra crispy.  Ahi Benedict was tasty as well.  $2 mimosas were a great deal + excellent staff"}
{"text":"I love the service whether I'm calling for pickup or dining at the restaurant. The Big Sur Black bean burger is my favorite."}
{"text":"Killing time with the family and stumbled into this awesome restaurant. One thing I highly recommend, is the ceviche!!! OH EM GEE!! Soooo good and very light!! Exactly what we needed especially in this heat! My son tried the lobster bisque....again on point!! Highly recommend if your in the Scottsdale area! The cocktails are an A+ plus too!!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials on drinks and appetizers, all around $5. The appetizer sizes are a little small though. Their secret sauce is amazing! Loved the outside patio, especially because it's dog friendly."}
{"text":"i went with my cousin and her friend and the food and drinks were great.  I ordered the ahi tuna with veggies and it was amazing.  I am on a lean diet so the portions were perfect.   I had vodka water with limes and it was made perfectly.  She order the burger and sweet potato fries and she loved it.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The food is consistently good. I feel like I only
Give bad reviews on Yelp, I think it's because places I frequent, I frequent and forget to review.

If you haven't been. You should partake."}
{"text":"I just disovered Hula's a few weeks ago.  The fish tacos were the absolute best that I've ever had.  I've been back twice and ordered double portions because they are so delicious.  The service was impeccable.  This restaurant is indeed \"as good as it gets.\""}
{"text":"This was a great place. The food was great and the drinks. I liked the outdoor seating next to the fireplace."}
{"text":"Solid cocktails here and happy hour eats are quite tasty. I had the Mai Tai and the Orange Martini which were both fantastic. We had the shrimp rolls, pork tacos, and fries. The shrimps rolls were a \"stop what you are doing and get you some\" kind of dish... complete with air quotes if I saw you in person. They were phenomenal. I will be back... soon. Hold on to your butts."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late lunch stop after shopping and before checking in I our hotel. If we lived in Phoenix, this would be a regular stop. Service, food, ambiance, and drinks were perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited since we live in the neighborhood. Both of us had visited before separately but it had been some time. 

My main complaint boils down to lackluster service. We were looking for a semi-quick bite and to get on with our Sunday. We noticed the menu said that they had happy hour on Sunday so we ordered some adult beverages and appetizers. I then ordered a their Luau Pork Sandwich and my wife ordered the Pork Tacos from the happy hour menu (so we thought). 

When the bill came it was quite large. Turns out only drinks were on happy hour. I am sure there was something that noted that fact but it obviously was not obvious since we both did not know this. In my opinion the server should have done a better job explaining the menu and happy hour deals instead of walking up and saying, \"Can I get you something to drink?\" I'm not looking for a line-by-line explanation of the menu but perhaps a quick overview of what is going on inside the 4-walls; especially when we order some things that any other day would be on happy hour. The server really just didn't seem to want to be there.

Nothing was horrendous about Hula's I just left feeling a bit bamboozled. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Had to come check this place out because there is one back home. Just to help me miss home even more, I went here for a late lunch. I had the Polynesian Chiken Sandwich with Sweet Potatoes. Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming workers, and of course delicious food. The portions have always been too much for me, but there is always that option for a to-go box. I haven't been to any happy hour functions, but this place is always packed & busy. I will bring good company next time I go instead of being a loner girl at the bar, Aloha!"}
{"text":"The Dinner Club dinned at Hula a few weeks back

The general consensus:

The Food: good, some great, some not so great. The appetizers were the weakest part of the meal: the coconut shrimp rolls were ok, the ahi wontons were disappointing, but the poke was tasty and the sweet potato fries were delish. 

The best entree by far was Duke's Luau Pork Plate, a delicious blent of sweet and salty on well cooked, extremely tender pork...yummm. The Steak Sandwich was also a treat. Disappointing was the Jawaiian Pork Plate (good, but not nearly as tasty as the other portk dish) and the fish tacos (also ok, but the same fish tacos you can get anywhere. Dessert was good but not mindblowing

So, why 4 stars not thee? Weeelllll....members of the DC voted to award an extra 1/2 point for delicious drinks and a nice happy hour. And, anothe 1/2 point for ambiance...the outdoor patio is a great place to hang and the sliding door provides a nice indoor/outdoor space. Plus, the funky old building has an awesome 6 pane wall window that is an awesome highlight,

Overall: worth checking out, great drinks, good food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love, love, love everything about Hulas. the atmosphere is great, very relaxed almost whimsical if you're sitting outside in the evening. Staff is friendly and quick to respond, my dishes are always cleared immediately and drinks remain full. My boyfriend and I typically have several cocktails each when we visit and they've yet to disappoint! Our favorite appetizer is, and ALWAYS will be, the fish bites. If you have never tried these I seriously urge you to, oh-my-yum! Perfectly cooked, tender fish covered in the crispiest  (not greasy) batter served alongside a creamy, spicy dipping sauce. If you're visiting for lunch or dinner the burgers are out of this world ( the black bean burger included-which Is my absolute obsession) , and all of the pork plates I've tried have been phenomenal . Very large portion sizes so my boyfriend and I always sample off each other's plates. I have visited week days as well as weekends and early enough for brunch as well as late in the evening for date night- excellent experience no matter the day/staff. During a recent staycation at a resort in Scottsdale we even opted to leave the grounds and go pick up Hulas , treated ourselves to dinner in bed as opposed to more fine dining options, and I don't regret it at all!  I've now had the opportunity to interact with the owner and his hospitality will surely keep us and friends coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"After coming here a couple of more times I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent spot on central, the drink I get is the scorpion bowl (4 two people) which is incredible!! Must try!!

This is more of a drinking spot because of the awesome atmosphere & location but as far as food I like the appetizers, but I think the entrees could be better!

I really rate this spot a 3.5 but I give it a 4 because of the amazing atmosphere!!!!

Try the ceviche appetizer & coconut shrimp roll appetizer...I am also looking forward to trying the new Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at when the weather is nice outside.... Great open air relaxed atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place look awesome...from the abandoned building to this...amazing!!  The ambience is fun and there is alot of eye candy...but that is where the good ends and the not so good starts. 

 I was there with a couple friends on  a Saturday night and we had a few dishes including the Ono Fish and the Pulled Pork.

The Ono Fish was decently cooked, but slightly overdone.  The sides that came with the entree included the wasabi mash which was best dish overall that I had all night.
The Pulled Pork was flavorful but not memorable.

I know you are reading this and wondering...so what's so bad about this place that lead to the 3 star review??

It was just okay...besides the atmospere, the food menu was too casual.  It just does not fit what I was experiencing visually.  There was nothing horrible about the food, but there was nothing worth coming back for.  
For many people, the food will they serve here will do...I just expect more for central phoenix."}
{"text":"I ate here two years ago and loved it. The service is terrible. We were billed for things we didn't order. The chicken tacos were good...if ordered at Baja Fresh. The kitchen ran out of desert 5 hours before closing on a Saturday. Do not go for anything other than happy hour."}
{"text":"Very good food! We ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese. They split our tacos up for us and didn't charge for it...the portions were great too!

Our server was friendly as well. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch, on the manager's reccomendation, I had the fish sandwich.  I talked about it all the way back to work.  It was one of the BEST sandwiches I have ever had!  I must say, we had 1 beer, 1 glass of wine, fish tacos and the best fish sandwich I have ever had and with tip it was 50 bucks.  I know good food/service/restaurant space is expensive, but... 
My only thought on this is for a $10 sandwich...throw in a side salad or something.  Other than that...great job!  I WILL be back for another $10 fish sandwich with no sides!"}
{"text":"I visited Hula's today for brunch and enjoyed every bite of the Mango Chicken Caesar salad that I ordered.  My friend ordered the Hula's Hangover Hash and she loved it!  I can't wait to come back and try more from Hula's menu (it all sounded so fresh and delicious)."}
{"text":"I want to rage on the Spicy Shrimp Mango salad I had for lunch last week. The dressing was amazing. I liked the souriness (is that a word?) of the dressing that evened out the spice of the shrimp. All cooled down by the taste of the sweet mango. (feel my mouth watering) Loved it and will be anxious to visit Hula's again. 

I visited about lunch time and the place was not that packed. The service and cleanliness of the restaurant was great and like the other yelpers, enjoyed the kitsch Hawaiian decor. If only there was a beach..."}
{"text":"Honestly, this might not have been my first call ex ante as it seems like a place for a slightly younger crowd, but my dear love insisted that she needed a Dr Funk after the afternoons activities and so we went for an early dinner. We had a delightful time on the patio-ceviche, poke and butterfish were absolutely lovely as were the Dr Funks which seemed to have the desired effect, and I had a great view for the whole meal. I will definitely be back to this wonderful place."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night just before the rush and got seats. Healthy menu and fun drinks. Loved my fish tacos with black beans and rice.  Only complaint: we were jammed in ( the table are close). Don't expect to have private conversations. Just good food."}
{"text":"Place is dirty!  Fruit flies everywhere.  Now I know why this place is so cheap for happy hour.  Staff wasn't bad though.  Place hasn't been cleaned in awhile!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you sacrifice sub-par customer service for great food, and other times you'll settle for sub-par food/drinks for the great customer service and ambience; amazingly you'll get the best of both worlds here. I have had nothing but great experiences every time I have been here and even told myself after my second to last visit that I would leave a positive review, but after tonight's service I made it a priority to leave my input. The service is always very attentive and kind, and the food and drinks selection is to die for. Me and my boyfriend swear by the cajun burger and mac and cheese both, paired with sweet potato fries and regular fries (they'll allow you to split both)--it's the stuff dreams are made of. The cocktails are fantastic in that they have a myriad of fun and exotic options for a reasonable price, yet they make sure not to skimp on the potency; notable selections would the blood orange martini (on the rocks) for a sweet and tart option, or a Scorpion Bowl (large tropical cocktail served in a bowl suitable for 2-4 people with a flaming shot of 151 in the middle) if you're sharing a good time with some friends. Our servers there have always been great, but a special thanks to both Kate and Kyle for consistently exceptional service. Both have truly gone above and beyond to accommodate our needs without batting an eyelash. 

I work in reputation management so I understand the importance of great establishments getting the public praise they deserve. Every restaurant should strive to be like this one--Hula's employees and management, keep doing what you're doing, don't change a thing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The service is great. I come here for a drink almost every night because this place is that wonderful. The servers like Christine, Keith, & Charlie are spot on & have my regular drink prepared as soon as I sit down. All of the bartenders thus far have been so skilled, friendly, & attentive. Manager Kyle actually works with his staff & is very involved in making sure patrons are treated like privileged guests. I would highly recommend this restaurant/bar to anyone who wants amazing bar service & a personalized fun experience. I feel like this place is the modern day Hawaiian version of Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some friends.  Pretty little spot in Phoenix.  I don't eat too heavy at lunch so I ordered the shrimp salad.  

It was actually pretty good.  Folks at my table ordered burgers, salads, and Thai bowls.  Everything was delivered in a timely manner and was delicious.  

I don't think this place would accommodate big crowds.  Seating is limited in this establishment... I may check out their happy hour some day, but overall it was an OK experience."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time ever after hearing good things from a ton of friends. i've been to other restaurants in the area (Maizie's, Panne Biano, etc) so I felt like it was about time I gave it a try. 

The restaurant was fairly busy for the small inside table space. Me and the BF got seated right away, and I of course went right for the drink menu, I don't usually like fruity drinks, which seems to be what they specialize in, but I gave the Tiki Bastard a try, the BF had the pain killer. My drink was pretty good, it has an overly string bourbon taste so if thats your thing, you definitely might enjoy. The BF's drink was too pineapple-y for my taste, but he loved it. 

We started by sharing the ceviche on fried wontons which was bomb. Very yummy, it didn't stand a chance. Me and the BF got into a debate about the food title worthiness of wontons when i declared wontons were one of my favorite foods. He argued wontons were not a food... I obviously disagreed. 

On to the entrees. I had the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries... It was good enough, I think the fries would have been much better had they been hotter or fresher... but overall it was a good meal. The BF had the habanero lime chicken tacos which were ahhh-mazing. Very very spice but delicious. 

We ordered another round of drinks before we finished. I had the mai tai which was really yummy with a fruity but almost sour taste that I loved. The BF had some other drink whose name i can't remember but it came with a backscratcher and had 151 in it. Too strong of an alcohol taste for me, but he liked it.

Overall, the restaurant was really yummy, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has the Best Burgers....hands down. I'm not even supposed to eat dairy and gluten because it upsets my stomach and I have no will-power to resist when I'm there. I relish every single bite (and believe me, I don't make exceptions to my restricted diet very often!) They make my favorite drink- the Zombie, and it's wonderful! The sweet potato fries are a favorite in our family! I love the fire ring outside and the open wall set up. It's a great option to be able to sit inside, but still have the full view of outside and the sights and sounds on the patio. A very cool vibe. Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy brunch here, lunch and even dinner. When the weather is nice it's fun to sit out on the patio. We really like the South Seas Fish Tacos and HULA'S Hangover Hash. Then if you need an afternoon cocktail go for a Dr. Funk or a Painkiller."}
{"text":"Great food,  great atmosphere!    The staff was very nice!  The Madagascar is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I love Hulas. Food is good, drinks are good, atmosphere is nice. One of my top 5 favorite places in Phoenix. If you like key lime pie, this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"The place itself was aesthetically pleasing. However, the food is a little pricy and quite greasy. I felt as if I was consuming 1800 calories with each bite of my food (granted, I did get the burger--it is possible that the fish was delicious albeit expensive). I would probably not go again, however."}
{"text":"I met some friends out for dinner and drinks.  The service was pretty good. Our waiter was nice but we had to flag him down a lot.  We were able to sit for over 3 hours without feeling rushed at all.  Plus the prices were quite reasonable.

We started with the chicken sticks which were great.  I had the Ahi Tacos that were messy but super delicious.  My friend had the ribs and another friend had a chicken dish, both of which I would also recommend.  They have a long list of cocktails which were all delicious, but it is hard to find something without pineapple.

They have a nice outdoor patio but we couldn't enjoy that because it was one of those weird experiences of rain in the desert.  Overall I'm glad I went and I would recommend again."}
{"text":"Hula's has great food, decent service and average drinks. The three stars is from the inevitable hour long wait any time you want to go. Definitely a bummer."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. Perfect hangover brunch spot. The food is actually pretty good. It is nice and chill. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato fries!! Bartender lady was very sweet, but didn't know much about food. Good happy hour fantastic choice of alcoholic beverages. I will return"}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch this past Sunday and it was fantastic!  The restaurant is very open and airy and the food was great - We had the the Ahi Eggs Benedict and Habanero Lime Chicken Tacos and both were delicious.  $2 Mimosas were awesome and we also tried the Scorpion Bowl (which packs quite a punch).  Looking forward to dinner here soon!"}
{"text":"Outdoor seating is a big selling point here.  Sit out on central and watch the cars, light rail, and people go by.

Cocktails are solid and Caribbean themed with Happy Hour all day Wednesday is pretty good.  Mimosas are pretty cheap on weekend mornings.

Food is quite yummy, the Ahi Tuna Tacos are particularly delicious.  I do like the fact you can get things here that you obviously wouldn't find at other restaurants such as plantains, johnny cakes, etc.  Portions are quite filling.

Bring your friends, relax, laugh, and pretend the closest large body of water isn't actually miles from here."}
{"text":"Looked all around Phoenix for a place to have a Mai Tai.  This place has the best in town and they are real Hawaiian style."}
{"text":"Love the unique menu 
Great fun atmosphere 
Tiki drinks are bomb
Go for lunch also it's less crowded"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places for Sunday brunch! Their drink specials are awesome, food's always great, service is also above expectations, overall a definite recommendation. Can't go wrong with what you order, whether its a burger, breakfast brunch, huge salads, all of it worth the money without breaking bank."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My boyfriend and I come here almost every weekend. The staff is always very friendly, the food comes out in the blink of an eye, and the atmosphere is great. I'm always recommending this restaurant to others and have turned many friends on to this joint. I especially love heading over for a delicious Saturday or Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"A year or so ago, I wrote a review after visiting Hula's that was not favorable. I didn't think I would ever give the place a second go. Tuesday night, however, another couple suggested we meet up for drinks there. I had been laid up for two days and was feeling better, so getting out of the house seemed really necessary, and one good thing Hula's still had going for it was that it was walking distance to my house. Another good thing it still had going for it was the drinks. So, distance and drinks in mind, the boy and I decided to give Hula's another chance. 

I don't know when it was in the past year, but Hula's radically changed their menu. There's still fish with a variety of rubs and some BBQ stuff, the menu seems twice the length. Once I realized the menu was so different, I decided I had to try the food, so I went with the Seared Ahi Tacos, part of their Labor Day special, and it was like a complete 180 from my memories of last year. Even the rice was ten times better. The other couple we were with had split a steak sandwich, which they loved,  including the salad that came with it. I wasn't hungry enough to eat both the tacos that were on my plate, but I wished I was. SO GOOD!

I also had the Hula's Hurricane, which I picked because it was the only drink that didn't have syrup or seem like it was mostly juice, but it was good. After a couple rounds, we decided we needed to try the scorprion bowl, which comes out lit on fire, so that's obviously a win. It's pretty sweet, but very tasty, and gets you in exactly the right mood to decide to go to Rosie's for karaoke.

The service was an issue last year, and to some extent still is. Our server was really nice, but we had a couple of empty glasses for a while, and I hate waiting to get a refill on a $8 drink. A couple of times the bartender brought our drinks over, and he was nice, too. 

I'm really happy I decided to check out Hula's once more. I love the MCM vibe, and that patio is perfect for our 79 degree autumn nights. With the changes in the menu and quality of the food, I'll definitely be hanging out there more throughout the coming months. It really looks like Hula got it in gear. Add a few more attentive servers and it will be in tip-top shape for a Cen Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"I must be the only person who was underwhelmed by Hula's. 

I will give them this: Their Blood Orange Martini and Mai Tai were good. Satisfying for a weekday afternoon Happy Hour. There are your two stars. 

Beyond that, I was left wanting more. The food, HH appetizers, was okay, but not transcendent. I mean, you can't really eff-up sweet potato fries (even tho I did have to add salt). But the Shrimp Spring Roll was more like, rice-tortilla stuffed with three shrimp and fried, so essentially my Spring Roll lacked any and all Spring. I don't remember what else we ordered. Maybe that was it. Obviously not worth remembering. 

And then there were the BEES! They would not leave our table alone! I know, I can't exactly blame Hula's for whatever urban wildlife may interrupt my dining experience. The waiter explained that they've had three different exterminators out there to address the problem, killed literally thousands in traps, and have concluded that there must be a hive about a block away that is currently building an insect metropolis inside some unsuspecting homeowner's walls. 

Really? ...No, I don't think I'll have another...and can we please be moved inside?"}
{"text":"Great food !!!! We had super fast service ! :))) I would definitely recommended !!!! I had some chicken bowl that was recommended by the server .... It was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"New Fav place. Seafood Ceviche is awesome!  Get it on Happy Hour for $5 (1/2 off, so get 2!! It's that good) The Likiikoo Margarita's was an excellent addition.  Fish Tacos were a little too spicy for me, so I traded the Hubs for his Luau Pork, excellent!!!   The service is good, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love the design of this place and was really looking forward to trying it out.....had a fish burger and sweet potato fries that both arrived cold, a waiter who vanished constantly, but good drinks.  Felt sick for a few days after that.   Tried it again when a friend was passing through town who had heard good things.  Again, absentee server, cold/uncooked food, and again I felt sick for a few days.  Beautiful spot, but I cannot give it another chance.  :^("}
{"text":"Every spring I travel with friends and family to Phoenix for 2 weeks of Spring Training.  Every year we go to Hula's two or more times.  Even though we all seemingly have variant tastes in food, we all love coming here.  First, the atmosphere is... (pardon me while a search for the right word).. comfortable!  We always come after dark and sit outside by the fire pit.  Fresh air, dark skies, warm fire all add up to a relaxing cozy home like feel that is just right.  The food is always excellent. It is different.  I would describe it as Southwestern inspired island food.  The service is hit or miss.  We have had some exceptional waitresses and others that have been adequate (fortunately no bad ones yet).  The crowds are a mix including twenty somethings, professionals, tourists and others.  The only true complaint I ever have with Hula's is that the staff is a LOT more attentive towards the twenty somethings than the other customers.  Since I have children in their twenties and am not twenty this can be a problem.  It does get bothersome to be by past by the waitress as she caters/dotes on the table of young people right next to us.
Even with this age discrimination, I would (and often do) recommend Hula's for its exceptional ambiance and excellent food.  (the ambiance is better than the food)"}
{"text":"I think I've been putting of writing a Hula review. DON'T GO HERE!! It's wonderful, and I like that there's almost always somewhere to sit without waiting!!

Expect to see someone you know, or someone you want to know at Hula. Watch whatever craziness they have projected on the wall without apology. Order the second drink you want, you can always sit and while away a little more time.

Brunch on the patio! Black bean burger! Sweet potato fries! Moscow Mule (sub Hendricks and say yes to the bitters)! Dark and Stormies! Yum! Yum! Yum!

Tiki paraphenalia, vintage LA photos, consistently good service, modern touches in the decor, a gutted and re-purposed central Phoenix landmark building, a chic firepit, umbrellas and mist, high seats, low seats, group seats, booth seats, open kitchen, electric car charging, bike rack, lightrail access, I mean really, what's not to like?

A word of caution: if you are not in the mood for an epic night, if you must get something done afterward, if you have any reason to drive posthaste, then DON'T ORDER THE SCORPION BOWL. It tastes so good when it hits your lips. If you're not careful, we'll be calling you Mr. Toad (the morning after your wild ride)!"}
{"text":"Another reviewer commented that she went to Hula's for lunch on 5/5/10 and was greeted by a \"menacing looking fellow\" in a Hawaiian shirt.  I, too, went for lunch on 5/5/10, and was greeted by the bartender -- a big guy in a Hawaiian shirt.  He welcomed us with a smile and greeted us by name -- even though we'd only been in twice before (and the last time was a little over a week ago).  In each of our three visits, he's been part of what made it a great lunch experience by being informed about the menu, attentive to the customers, and able to mix great drinks.  His presence, along with the comfortable atmosphere and good food, will keep us coming back to Hula's bar for lunch."}
{"text":"For those of you who are familiar, this feels like a wanna-be Duke's, but lacking style and food follow-through. I wanted to like this place as i was really craving some good fish, but left disappointed with my jerk-prepared butterfish.  Even the sweet potato fries seemed a little mushy."}
{"text":"Most amazing sweet potato fries of my life, though my server was a tad on the rude side."}
{"text":"Butterfish done Coconut Style - WAS AMAZING. One of the best fish dishes I've had in town. The drinks for happy hour were great too! Loved my martini.... yum. Would highly recommend... only oops was when my husband asked for ice with his water, the server poured his 3/4 filled glass into the pitcher and refilled - wouldn't be a problem, except that he had already drank some... So the point - don't drink the water - drink the martinis!"}
{"text":"This place would have gotten 5 stars, but I thought the food had a tad too much salt. That said, the service was top notch and the food was very good and flavorful! We got the ahi tuna poke which was good but salty... Then the lemongrass hapu which was phenomenal!!! I would definitely come back here:)"}
{"text":"I would give Hulas a 4.5. The only problem I have had with this place has been the parking. So, we just are sure to go on off hours. Not a big issue. 

Other than that the food is amazing! I always get the fish sandwich and we get the fries or edamame to start with their pie at the end. We have never been disappointed with the food or the service. I always recommend this place to people. The loaction is really cool looking and fun to sit in to people watch or just hangout."}
{"text":"My sister and I were actually planning on trying out St. Francis down the street, but upon driving up, discovered it is closed on Mondays! So, we headed down the street to Hula's to check out their soft opening.  I had walked over there earlier to check it out and grab a menu and everyone was so friendly, so I suggested to my sister we eat there.  

They were only offering a limited menu for their soft opening, but this menu along with the regular menu which offers about three times as many delicious menu options were both fabulous! 

We decided to sit on their patio, which despite the large fire pit in the middle was remarkably cool for a summer night! The atmosphere was great - nice and quiet yet you still feel like you're somewhere happening and trendy.  It actually kind of felt like we were eating in a trendy part of LA.  The staff was all very friendly, and our service was prompt and pretty efficient.  They goofed with the food they brought to our table twice, but it did not affect our dining experience at all, as the food was still brought out within 15 minutes or so.  This was pretty impressive for their first night.  

Now on to the food ....  soooo good! We started with the seared ahi wontons, which were pieces of fresh ahi tuna atop a crisp wonton and served with a wasabi sour cream/green onion garnish - perfect combination of flavors.  Both my sister and I said we would order this again as a meal.  We shared a lemongrass encrusted ono, which came with rice and a cabbage slaw.  This was also a perfect combination of flavors.  The portion was fairly large, too, so it was a great dish to share - we even were able to take home some leftovers.  The one comment my sister had was that she would order the sauce on the side next time because it was kind of rich, but I was pretty happy with it.  We did not order any alcoholic beverages, so I cannot comment on those, but from the looks of the drink menu and all of the people around us ordering drinks, they seem to be pretty good! I had their passion fruit iced tea, and it was so good I asked for some to go.  

I give this place four stars not five because of a small snafu ... I brought the leftovers (which the server packaged for us in a container she labeled with the contents and the date), and while my boyfriend was eating them just minutes later, he found a short black hair in the dish .... Kinda gross but hoping it was just an off moment for them because I still cannot wait to go back and try some other menu items like the Thai Chicken bowl and the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update this review because I received a very prompt, thoughtful, and kind email from the owner, demonstrating the care and passion he has for his restaurant.  It is clear that he really does care, and wants patrons to enjoy their time at Hula's.  I really respect his reaching out to me.  The three stars reflect this.  My group will give Hula's another shot, and hopefully, we can make it a 5 star visit."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go so far as to say I frequent Hula's, but when I am in the neighborhood, I make it a point a point to stop in. What can I say? The food is fair to good depending on the day, you can't go wrong with the Cajun burger, it's delish every time.

The main reason I go to Hula's is because I LIKE TO PARTY. Don't get me wrong, I'm not an alcoholic, but I love me some booze. Hula's is THE premier destination to go and get your drank on. Whether you have an affinity for Mai Tais, mimosas or bloody marys, they have the perfect libation to whet your whistle. 

The staff there is mostly... What's the right word, amazing?!?!?!!!! They have a really great group of people there, but the last few times I have been I have been served by Tia, and she's awesome! Not only is she funny, fast and courteous, but she's a bona fide beauty to boot! If you know what's good for you, check her out!

So, when it all comes down to it, my recommendation is go for the service, stay for the drinks.

Peace and hair grease...

Monty"}
{"text":"Freaking tacos man. THOSE TACOS. It's all so delicious. They have an absolutely gratifying albacore salad. Wonderful drinks. I love it when I'm loving rum. You gotta drop a pretty penny but it's totally worth it. I believe they have some excellent happy hour specials and they have a rockin' brunch. Whoever picks their music is doing good and those movies being projected add a nice touch."}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick drink. I have celiac disease, so I needed to have a gluten free vodka. Our server, Ariel, said they were out of Titos, but would come up with a good replacement. Our drinks were soooo yummy!  And Ariel was such a sweetheart! We'll definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Fun vibe, dog-friendly patio, and fish tacos to die for.  One of our visits was on Easter Sunday - the place was packed with families, yet service was still fast and friendly.  I bought  a couple of their tumbler glasses for the cute logo. Always a good time."}
{"text":"Saturday & Sunday all day (11ish-7) funday?? What could be better? Well on this past Sunday nothing! Went for a friend's birthday celebration...was my first time going Tiki and I have to say the sweet potato fries and Hawaii 5-0 were a perfect addition to an already awesome day...Let's just say I am ready to Tiki it up again!"}
{"text":"So let me start this review with the embarrassing admission that I walked outside to make a phone call and have a cigarette the other night and completely forgot that I had not yet paid for my dinner and drinks which I guess is a testament to the strength of the Mai Tia's that John was feeding me all night I kept begging him to stop but to no avail...... there I did find someone to blame..... not that I am advocating this kind of behavior there was however a quiet understanding of hey I've been there before by Dana whom I emailed my apologies to immediately the next morning and was informed that it wasn't a big deal and to just cover it the next time I rolled in.......  Okay so now having said all of this I did have a point to make ........ the food, the people, the service, the atmosphere, all deserve 5 stars as they almost always do It's not that I had anything new and exciting I had the same thing I often do the Samurai beef sticks with the Butter fish pan fried.... that's the point I'm trying to make even though I had what I've had several times before it was so on point it made me want to come back again and again and again like I said in my first review they do what they do and they do it well....... Til next time  

P.S. as I had said in my last review that I hoped they were just having a bad day in my opinion that is exactly what  happened for the sole reason that my great meals have for out weighed any bad meal (as in singular)  that I have ever had at Hula's"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food, awesome drinks, and the friendly staff make it so I always have a good time here.

I am addicted to the ceviche; I get it here just about every week.  It is so good.  The Juan Ho is a unique tequila cocktail that was created just for Hula's Modern Tiki. I think it is the best of their specialty drinks. plus I love the blue color.

I have tried about half of the items on the menu and I like them all.  Some of my recommendations are: The Dark and Stormy cocktail, Pork Tacos, Big Sur Black Bean Burger, Edamame, Hula Burger, Seaweed Salad, and the Cole Slaw.  I even found a recipe for the cole slaw on line and have made it at home, I like it that much."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by stating that this is my first yelp review ever and that I have been a server for many years. I don't like writing these because I know that bad nights happen in this business and unfortunately, people leave with bad experiences sometimes. 

The reason I decided to write one is because I think how our server handled our situation was a MAJOR no no that I thought ever server knew not to do. We were on a double date and to start, we were sitting there for 15 mins before anyone greeted us, and when our server did, she didn't introduce herself or say sorry for the wait. Just asked if we wanted something besides water. The couple we were with decided to get Mac n cheese as their side, which was also a $4 up charge. Our took one into it and bit into an inch size piece of plastic!! It was clear with red cut marks (that show you where to cut) on it. We told our server, who was already extremely hard to track down, that he had found plastic and all she said had to say was \"oh, well do you want a new one?\" And he politely said no. She took it away and that was it. There was no, \"I'm so sorry\" or \"let me get a manager for you\" nothing. And when she did finally return, she simply dropped off our check and said thank you. She had only removed the $4 charge. Even though I had come here several times before and had even recommended it to multiple friends previously, it is very unlikely I will be returning."}
{"text":"It is a novel idea to have an island themed restaurant in Phoenix that serves up your Hawaiian inspired meals! The menu has many options that should suit all dietary preferences including sandwiches/burgers, Hawaiian  style plate lunches and fish creations. I always go for a fish entree, where you choose your fish type and preparation style, and have never been dissatisfied. 

This evening I chose the market fish (snapper for $16) in the blackened prep style with wasabi mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The fish was deliciously spicy with a cooling wasabi cream sauce served on top! The wasabi potatoes were good but nothing spectacular and the vegetables did not exceed expectations but at least had a mild soy sauce glaze drizzle. The service was attentive but slightly pushy to move us out.

Overall my experience here continues to consist of great tasty food and forgettable service. It is the menu that brings me back every time and I would recommend Hulas for a casual date night or dinner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"PATIO-PATIO-PATIO! 
It was a little tricky to get seated, but we got it done and were happy how fast the service was once seated. 

Food is good to really good. SPICY EDAMAME for a starter. Hella good! I kept it real and had the HULA BURGER. Basic burger, but I have to really be more excited about the Volcano Bowl! Careful, do not drink too fast and share with 6 people or you will be tore up! 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried their food yet, But their drinks are pretty good! The atmosphere is chill the employees I wouldn't say are the nicest but whatever my server last night was attentive and would check up often to make sure we were good on drinks. I'd recommend this place if you are looking for a chill place to drink with friends."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last evening for a bday happy hour celebration. The food was fantastic, the drinks tasty/strong, and the prices reasonable. The only reason why I'm giving it three stars is that the service wasn't that great. Our party was ignored multiple times and they wouldn't let us sit at our table until half of us arrived, so we just ended up crowding the front bar. Our waitress left in the middle of dinner and didn't tell us, and the bartender treated us like we were inconveniencing him. It was pretty busy, but still it's no reason to be rude.

Overall the place was good, and I'd like to go back (maybe for brunch), but I hope the service improves!"}
{"text":"If you like bland food, slow impersonal service then this is the place for you. Just left the \"Mother's Day\" lunch. We don't know our servers name, we had to ask for drinks to be replenished, and left a tiny tip which I rarely do. But it is the reason I hate \"posh\" places. Blah. Spend $70+ elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is an great placed. brought to phx from from santa cruz,ca. one the best things that has crossed over to az from cali in a long time. the staff is great! the poke and dr funk are my favorite! ive never brought a guest in for their first visit that didnt return because the food, service and decor are awesome! VISIT HULA!!! another wonderful thing about this great spot is they regularly give back to the community by donating sales to various nonprofits in arizona! i heart hula! and u will too!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place rocks!!!  The food is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect.  I would recommend the  Hawaiian Ceviche, Shrimp Rolls and Lobster Bisque - all were fantastic.  Bring a date, I'm sure they would be impressed."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and an appetizer and it was awesome. The ambiance was unique for the valley and their patio was big enough to have ample room where I didn't feel like I was sitting at someone else's table with them.    

 If you love rum (and I do) this place is for you!  Great drink-list with a ton of choices, we tried three different drinks and each one was made perfectly and was incredibly tasty. For appetizers we had the ceviche and the shrimp rolls.  Both were awesome!  The ceviche was a great-sized portion and was very tasty.  The shrimp rolls were also great, I wish I could have ordered more just to try different stuff. 

I can't wait to try dinner there!"}
{"text":"Attended a Local First Arizona Mixer here yesterday for Lunch, The service was fantastic, the food was so fresh and tasty and the salad was crisp and cut to just the right size leaves.  I hat stuffing my mouth with a half head of lettuce leaf.  We sat in the bar patio area which was very likable, had no problem with Parking either.
I give this place Five Stars especially for the food, thanks Hula's I'll be back real soon..."}
{"text":"*This review is based on drinks only* 

My sis Jacinthe & I participated in the Cupcake Crawl last night & it was a lot of fun! Hula's was the 2nd stop from 7-8pm. Their happy hour ends at 6pm Mon-Fri, but they let us crawlers have the happy hour prices, nice. There wasn't much room for us so we had to stand at 1st, ugh, but then 2 ladies left early to the next stop & we snagged their seats. We ordered the blood orange & pink bikini martinis (only $5 each, regularly $7). Both were so yummy! We also got to sample lil cupcakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes, white chocolate raspberry FTW! Since it was nearing the time to head to the next stop we only ordered those 2 cocktails, but I wish we had time for another round because they were so delicious & cheap! The only complaint we had was that it was super hot in there & we had to use menus to fan ourselves. I do have to say I love that open patio though, it would be so nice to sit out there & have cocktails in the fall & spring time. I would definitely return for happy hour & maybe sample some food!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere.  Hawaii five-o meets the desert!!  I love Hawaiian food, but this place offers a lighter side to the Hawaiian life style.  Minus the Spam and Heavy portions of the Serious \"plate plate\" meal in Hawaii, I consider this place satisfactory.  If you want a taste of Hawaii try the Luau Pork plate.  I had Hawaiian style Roasted pork before, and Hulas is pretty darn good.  Season well, not to salty.  Try the blacken Wasabi Fish, also a good choice.  The decor is what impressed me the most, back in the day restaurant, used to be a mid-century florist.   Adorned in Tiki statues and fabulous outdoor fire pit..."}
{"text":"Here this afternoon to try the eggs benedict with spam! That's right SPAM! Oh yeah, it was pretty darn good.

Although my dish was good some minor improvements can be made to make it perfect; toast the muffin more, mine was hardly toasted at all and the hollidase sauce needs a little more pizzaz, it was on the bland side. 

Overall, I really like the food here, both brunch and dinner, love the location and atmosphere, great patio, and pretty decent servers. 

PS. Dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"I'm very impressed by the appearance of the place.  It has a nice outdoor area.  In the Spring, Fall and Summer, this will be a nice place to hang out.  They also have great drinks here.  I had a pink bikini martini which was quite tasty, while another had the blood orange martini which was delicious.  The mai tai looked good, but I didn't try it.  The food was just okay.  I had a pork sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Not bad, but not great...needed a bit more flavor (could have used a kick to it)...the service was quite good though."}
{"text":"What a wonderful December evening to have dinner on Hula's outdoor patio. We got there about six, and were seated immediately outside next to the fire pit. I thought we might get to hot, but it was Great seating. I ordered the Blackbean burger and yam fries. The burger was delicious and so were the fries. I'm not much of a fan for mixed drinks, but I did order a glass of wine that was just perfect with my food. The service was great, and I would go back to this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Hula's with my girlfriends in the winter and we fell in love.  I think we came 3 straight weeks in a row even though we were suppose to be trying new restaurants out.  We couldn't help it, we would go on Wednesday nights when happy hour was all night.  They have delicious drinks and appetizers, I love the sweet potato fries and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls.  I have tried many of their dinner items and always come back to getting a huge house salad with chicken.  The dressing is amazing!  Absolutely love Hula's and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The concept is cool. The place is cool. The food is alright. Come for the atmosphere and neighborhood... but not specifically the food itself."}
{"text":"I adore this place.  As a vegan, they have been very considerate of my dietary preferences and are very careful to make sure everything is put together without the use of animal products.  It is nice because it allows my non-vegan friends and I to get together without someone having to stress out over what they can eat.  :-)"}
{"text":"Mai Tai !!!!  Excellent !!!  This is a \"must go to\" every time I am in Phoenix, always great food experience,  Great fish taco's but everything I have tried there is great!
Nice bar, well run, comfortable, happy crowd of customers... says it all!"}
{"text":"I really do not know why it took so long for me to find this place!! It has such a great, relaxed vibe and oh man the mai tais are incredible! [I highly recommend the Dr. Funk!]"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but loved it!  

It definitely has the urban vibe. I had a hamburger with the hula sauce on the side - delish!  It was cooked perfectly with great flavor and served on yummy bun. Wish I could have eaten the whole thing, but it came with amazing sweet potato fries and I filled up on those.  Probably the best I've ever had!

Seems like a great place for happy hour so I'll definitely be coming back for that."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. This particular occasion we just had drinks . Happy hour specials from 10:30am - 7pm on all drinks on a Saturday was a pleasant surprise! We were greeted and seated promptly. Our server was very polite and attentive. The drinks - potent. Great place to hang out and chat over drinks."}
{"text":"Such a fun and chill atmosphere! The happy hour is pretty decent but one thing I love about this place are the drinks!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  The atmosphere is really nice & the food is pretty good. I wasn't crazy about what I got but I did like it & the portions were good. My husband really liked his dish. We will be going back for sure to check it out again!"}
{"text":"We order takeout at least once a week. Everything is delicious, even when the revolving takeout/host staff get it wrong (which is 98% of the time). The Fish Bites and Modern Tiki Fish Sandwich are my absolute favs., but whether they are served at lunch or not depends on who (again, takeout/host staff) you order from evidently. Atmosphere is fun! Never had a wrong order dining in."}
{"text":"So happy there's a 2nd location in Scottsdale. Luv the drinks! Fun atmosphere! Luv the vegan options!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place as it was close to my hotel.  I'm a creature of habit and will definitely be back.  The service was great!  I had the tuna burger and it was delicious.  The patio was open and the weather was perfect and like the name says it has a very cool modern feel.  They also have a nice selections of cocktails.  I would definitely recommend Hula's Modern Tiki."}
{"text":"New favorite spot in PHX. Great food and even better drinks!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that had options for both my self (vegetarian) and my friend (not vegetarian). This place has various options to choose from I chose the black bean burger it was absolutely delicious. I paired it with the sweet potato fries. I would definitely come back here again. Great service and most importantly delicious food."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot! The basis of any brunch place is solid hash browns and this place delivers. The loco moco is a hangover cure and a little piece of heaven. I would also recommend the ahi eggs Benedict. The Cajun hollandaise sauce was lighter and more flavorful than other eggs Benedict. 

The drinks were a lot stronger than I was expecting (which is not a bad thing at all). Our group of three avid drinkers got one of flaming bowl drinks to share and we at the perfect level of drunk while eating our food. The resurgence of tiki bars is something I don't personally don't grasp however this modern take on them is very conducive to a boozy brunch."}
{"text":"I would like to high five the person that came up with the design concept for this place because they are awesome, and so is Hula's.

I went here on a Thursday night for drinks and dinner before seeing a show in central Phoenix. I just love that there's a completely open air patio, a covered bar/dining area and an additional little section that's also open air but more fitted for intimate dining rather than groups.
Lights strung, great music, good wait staff, this palce just was a really lax, tropical, island vibe to it without being over the top Hawaiian- which can be tacky. It pulls more from the vintage 1950 beach bunny scene and it works, really well. 
I ordered the calamari sandwhich with sweet potato fries- per Foursqaure suggestion.
Um, HELLO beautiful. It was so amazing. the salw and just enough crunch to the breaded and fried calamari strips with an ah maze ing ailoia sauce that even went well with the fries. But my favorite part of this heavenly plate with the flakiness of the roll. It was a Kraiser roll but cracked just enough to amazing.
Every weekend they have a fantastic happy hour special. Check that out and also like them on Facebook, trust me, you'll want to.
Can't wait to go back and try all the yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"I was looking for good late night food and found this amazing place! Great cevivhe, tacos, authentic Hawaiian food til midnight. I'm prescatarian and this is great fish. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival this location appeared to be lively and upbeat. Within minutes we realized that the wait staff however was unorganized and unprepared for a large group. Even with reservations the location was unable to accommodate more customers unless you had the right look then to apparently you could walk right in and get a table for two or six in under five as two other groups did. Requesting to speak with the manager proved to be pointless. He quickly dismissed my concern and made no attempt to rectify the issue. Since half of the party was already seated we continued to wait for additional 22 minutes before being seated. Unless the food is to die for this will be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. What a great experience. I felt like I was on vacation somewhere in the islands.  Great atmosphere, food and service.  You could tell the people that worked there, liked being there. 

I wanted a sample of a few items so i ordered the plantain, Johnny cakes and fish bites. Oh, and I had a mai tai that was amazing (strong and not for the faint of heart). 

The prices are very reasonable and the portions and large."}
{"text":"Seriously? Yes. 
Just yes.
My review is yes.
Anytime anyone asks if I want to eat here, the answer is yes.
This place is GREAT!
Love the tea. the drinks. the food. the service. the atmosphere.
It's dog friendly! Theres a great fireplace outside. Can you sense my excitement?!
To be fair, I typically order the same thing when I go (polynesian chicken sandwhich & sweet potatoe fries)
We recently went during happy hour and had these bomb little shrimp appys? Stop reading my review, and just go. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Hula's is way too fun.  I threw a going away party for My best friend, a reservation for 30 people on an already busy Saturday night. The staff was amazing! Very attentive and friendly. Delicious food and The cocktails are to die for."}
{"text":"Went there at lunch time. Very limited menu till 330. All the goos hawaiian meals unavaliable. Had the cajun burger, sauce was  ok, burger kinda small. I also had the ceasar salad, taste like out of a bag. Would probably be much better at dinner when you can actually order hawaiian meals. Tropical ice tea..........nothing special just ice tea. Very dissapointed :("}
{"text":"My favorite day drinking place.  Great patio, friendly staff, tasty drink options, and well lit clean environment.  Make sure you order the Dr. Funk if you are undecided; it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Who knew that there were undercover cops on the light rail who checked if you paid the fare and asked for tickets? Having been thrown off the light rail in front of Hula's, I decided to stop in and have a cocktail. 

Nattily dressed in my silk Hawaiian shirt, I felt right at home. I ordered one of the more expensive voodoo drinks and was surprised it was served with four straws. My bartender advised it was so big and full of alcohol, it was generally shared among friends, I advised him that I share a lot among friends (including the tab) but not my drinks. 

Knocking down the cocktail, I decided to cruise Hula's and check out the clientele (particularly any Hula Girls). Regaled in my authentic Hawaiian shirt, I was immediately mistaken as a waiter by the staff and diners. This led to me walking out of Hula's with $200 cash in tips. Needless to say, i will be back with another stylish Hawaiian shirt out of Condor's closet!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time and was blown away by the prompt service, attentive and happy staff, quality food with fresh ingredients and delicious drinks. I wouldn't write a review for a first time at a restaurant but Hula's definitely deserved the credit. We were immediately seated and our waiter was over in a couple of minutes. Took our drink order immediately along with our appetizer order. Our food and drinks throughout the night were out in minutes. As a chef the quality of food was great, you can tell they take pride in sourcing fresh ingredients. I ordered the vegan bowl and that's another reason this restaurant is so great. They offer vegetarian and vegan friendly options that go beyond a salad and grilled vegetables. We will be returning again very soon!"}
{"text":"Revisited  a weeks ago, happy to report that the food was more consistent and service was improved...  had eggs Benedict and they were indeed what you would expect..."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor restaurant that brought my husband I back to Maui. Our hula burger and pulled pork sandwich was great but their banana cream pie topped off the day! We went their mainly so our dog could be a patron as well. Definitely will go back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we will be back!!  The food is excellent, good size portions and reasonable prices!  Great happy hour.  The best poke since I was in Hawaii!   Our server Morgan was terrific!"}
{"text":"Fun location, fun environment. There were good things and there were bad. As a fan of Hawaii, I was excited to try this place. My party of 4 was seated promptly on a Friday night and ordered drinks and appetizers. The edamame was so spicy that it was inedible for 3 of us. The ceviche was perfect, fresh and tasty. The drinks - mainly the mai tai's - were crisp, delicious and strong. All of our main entrees were so spicy that mine was nearly inedible, but I ate as much as I could since I was very hungry. My friend ordered a burger and it was so spicy that she could only eat half! I stayed in Hawaii for a week and never had this much of an issue with things being too hot/spicy to eat. If they could tone down the spice, I would go here every week for mai tais and appetizers. It started to rain during our meal and we were seated outside, so we raced with our plates to the nearest table which was under the roof of the outdoor patio and bar area. A server promptly came over and said \"this table is reserved\". Well, it had been sitting empty for our entire meal so far, the people had not arrived yet, and it was RAINING and we had our meals. Did you just expect us to sit in the rain and continue eating? We were paying customers! You have to think on your feet as waitstaff with an outdoor seating area. In case of inclimate weather, you must have a plan for accommodating your guests without leaving them in the rain holding their plate of food."}
{"text":"I have not been here for over a year but have been wanting to write a review.  It was a nice evening and the garage doors/walls were open.  Hula's has a very comfortable atmosphere.  We started with the Spicy Edamame, loved them!  For main course, I had the Lemongrass Encrusted Butterfish.  My husband had Duke's Luau Pork Plate.  They were both good but I liked the fish better.  I am planning on going again when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"The fusion of traditional Hawaiian favorites were combined in way to make the meal savory.

The nostalgic decor with a modern twist is enjoyable."}
{"text":"The central Phoenix corridor has seen an explosion of new restaurants over the past year. Hula's is one of the most recent additions having opened last month. In terms of location and venue, nothing could be better. Located right on Central Ave near a light rail stop in a newly renovated building, Hula's has excellent street appeal. Not to mention a great indoor/outdoor dining area and patio that is perfect for the October to April Phoenix weather. However, I feel that if Hula's does not work hard to rectify some less than favorable first impressions, Hula's may not make it until May.

Let me be clear that I have only dined there once so far, and while my personal experience would not prevent me from returning, my dining companions from that night are likely not to return. When it takes three times to get a dish correct based on the initial order, there is either a communication issue between the server and the kitchen, or the server has not been properly trained or have the experience with various food-related allergies that can be life threatening to an individual. If you read the other Yelp reviews, you'll see a similar pattern where diners received meals that were not prepared to their specification. Our server was very friendly and apologetic, and ultimately the meal was served properly, but it is first experiences like this that will kill a restaurant.

That said, both my food and drink were good. I ordered the mahi tuna burger with fries. The filet of tuna was a little too large to eat the burger comfortably with my hands, so I resorted to a knife and fork; no big deal. The portion/price ratio was on the spot, so I don't feel like I overpaid. Our server was polite, attentive, and courteous, so no complaints there. I plan to dine there again in the near future, but I hope the owners are reading Yelp to see the areas of opportunity for their business. First impressions are lasting impressions, and diners these days are more finicky than ever."}
{"text":"Very modern interior with a diverse menu. Poke bowls are awesome and the burgers you can't go wrong with. Pricing very fair. Both locations are equally as good. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing, very flavorful with fresh ingredients. Service was good and very fast. Definitely going back soon"}
{"text":"Finally made our way here and happy we did. I had the calamari sandwich with fries. While it wasn't what I was expecting (think Spanish calamari bocadillo) it was still good. The fries were great!  The experience was good enough that I def want to come back to try the steak sandwich. I'll update my review after another visit, but I was happy with our first time here. The bf LOVED the jerk chicken and if he likes your food, I'll def give the menu another shot."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 6:30, did not have to wait long for a table.  Service was great,  the layout of the place is really amazing and the food was so good. You do get your money's worth and portion. Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit Friends of Animal Control and Care and was not disappointed! I am not a big fan of alcoholic beverages but this place made them fantastically. Got the Dr. Funk while my companions got Zombie and Hurricane. All were very tasty especially the Dr. Funk. MmmMMm. 

The appetizers were well portioned, I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat. No complaints from them so definitely a good sign. 

Service was great, even though we were doing the special we still received plenty of attention.

I will be back but this time to try some food!"}
{"text":"I moved to phoenix from oahu hawaii and heard great things about this place. They had Hinano on tap which reminded me of home. The coconut shrimp rolls were ono. The sashimi and poke were also good. Except the sashimi was not properly cut and the presentation could have been better. I had the Bali hai mango ribs which were very very good. The coleslaw needs some work and the sweet potato fries were broke da mouth good. The service was good and friendly. Definatly comming back for another visit"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here alot. I love having this place in the neighborhood because we're new to Phoenix and were fans of a particular tiki bar in Chicago. So to find a place like this nearby was pretty exciting. It's not like our Chicago place, but I love that Hula's has food.

We tend to come on Friday afternoons for happy hour, really can't beat the prices for tiki drinks, apps and a chill atmosphere. The employees are always nice and I've never had a bad time.

My favorite drinks are the Painkiller and the Dr Funk. I usually get one of each and leave happy and ready to start my weekend."}
{"text":"We went to hula's for my friend's birthday dinner, and it was fantastic! The atmosphere was so relaxing and fun, and the food and drinks were great. I highly recommend the pink bikini martini! Had the chicken sticks for appetizers and split the Mongolian beef bowl. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for 10 days and decided to venture out for lunch today. And then, I fell in love. Love the decor, love the vibe, love the staff, love the food. Can't wait to take everyone there. So happy to have this place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hula's is amazing! I recently moved to the Biltmore area at the end of November and saw Hula's as I was driving down Central one day and decided to give it a try. I quickly became obsessed and for good reason!

I've been here over 10+ times the last few months with girlfriends for Happy Hour or with my boyfriend on a weekend evening and I have always had outstanding service, amazing food and awesome drinks that knock my socks off. Not to mention the prices are totally reasonable!

The Ahi Caesar Salad and Sweet Potato fries are my favorite go-to's. And the Blood Orange Martini is soooo good. My boyfriend swears by the the Teriyaki Ribeye.

I have to give the owner a shoutout for taking good care of my boyfriend & I about a month ago on a Friday evening. (This rave review is long overdue!) 

My guy is in the Marine Corps and is stationed in Cali so we only get to see each other on the weekends when one of us makes the 6 hour drive to each other. He arrived around dinnertime on a Friday night and we headed to Hula's for his first visit. We were both starving and ordered quickly after sitting down. The food was delayed quite a bit for whatever reason and our server kept coming over to apologize. We assured her that we didn't mind at all... we only get to spend about 48 hours with each other so we were just enjoying each others' company, so no big deal! We never even questioned what the hold up was even though we had noticed that it was taking awhile. We finally got our food & our server told us that dessert was on the house for our patience. We thanked her & told her it wasn't necessary. Again, no big deal, we hadn't voiced a single complaint! My boyfriend did decide to take advantage of the offer though since again, we came in starving and we enjoyed a delicious dessert. He also asked the server if Hula's sold their awesome teriyaki glaze for purchase. To our surprise, our server went back to the kitchen & came out with a coffee cup wrapped in tin foil filled with the glaze for us to take home! Talk about going the extra mile regarding service! My boyfriend was tickled. At the end of our meal, even MORE to our surprise, our server dropped off a check with a balance of $0.00. She told us that the owner really appreciated our patience & understanding and that our meal was on the house. We were blown away!

To the owner of Hula's... THANK YOU. I have told this story to so many people and spread the word around about Hula's to anyone who hasn't tried your restaurant yet. My boyfriend is now rightfully obsessed with eating at Hula's whenever he comes to town on the weekends & I try to frequent the restaurant at least once every couple of weeks with girlfriends on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Such a lovely spot to eat at. They have a cute little patio outside. My first visit was awesome.
This visit was a complete disaster!! It took 20 min to get our drinks. Our appetizer came out with our food. Out of 4 people only 1 received the correct  entree. Two of us got the wrong thing. One of us had to wait since the order was \"forgotten\". By the time the order came the fish was burnt. Keith did a great job trying to fix things. Now, I took half of my burnt fish home. While I was eating it I discovered a hair, not one but two. Gah!!!
Not sure I'll be back. maybe they need a new chef or bring the old one back."}
{"text":"So good! The food is amazing and our server was great. The only reason I took off a star was because of the super rude hostess that chastised our group like we were a bunch of unruly schoolchildren. There were several tables open and she wasn't around, so we sat ourselves. That is one mistake I'll never make again. I'll give the place another try because everything else is so wonderful but if there is another experience with rude waitstaff, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, third time here, l love it, food is great, prices are good. They even allow dogs on the patio. Only negative is that if you dine alone they treat you as if you weren't, meaning they leave you waiting as if you had someone to talk to."}
{"text":"First time visiting Hulas, and I really enjoyed it. The atmosphere and ambiance is very laid back and tropical, with tiki heads and surfer posters everywhere. Clean, friendly, and an awesome drink menu! Cuisine offers a mix of seafood and island favorites with your standard burgers, steaks and fries. Vegetarian options are readily available. Our party had no problems with service on a busy saturday night. I ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes, cooked medium rare. I'm not the biggest fan of ribeyes, and the price was a little steep, but overall the meal was flavorful and hot. I'd have to say that the real highlight here is their tropical drinks. Men, here is a bar where you can order a Mai Tai with no shame. No touristy girl drinks here, only strong Mai Tais made with excellent rum! If you're a fan of the 50s and 60s like I am, or you're looking for something new for dinner and drinks, try it out!"}
{"text":"I like the coconut shrimp and sweet potato fries. The specialty drinks are very good, some are a little sweet for my taste, but there's a full bar. I especially like coming during the winter and sitting on the patio near the fire pit. The last time we were there it looked like they were setting up for live music on the patio. It's never overly crowded when we've gone. The staff has always been attentive and friendly. The place is inviting, comfy and good place to relax with friends."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to have some good food and lovely drinks.  Service is great and you can't beat the all day happy hour on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Shrimp rolls were our fave...crispy and flavorful with a pineapple dipping sauce.  Painkillers were great, as was the Dr. Funk and the Dark and Stormy.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and delicious food!  Jawaiian Jerk Chicken was so flavorful; the plantains were unique - sweet and great texture. Wish I had room for the ahi tacos... They sounded amazing."}
{"text":"It was a toss up 3 or 4 stars, so this is on the 3.5 side of 3 EDIT:see note below. There are so many cool places to try in Central Phoenix it is almost hard to get to them all. This would be an easy 4 star review if my server had been a little more attentive/friendly and my wine had not been hot (not room temperature, not slightly warm) we are talking about 20 minute old coffee hot. The ambiance is great we sat on the patio right off Central Ave, so their was plenty of cool scenery, and the weather was perfect. Started off with the spicy edamame and it was very tasty. Then followed up with a little chicken curry dish that was probably the best mix of curry flavor that I have ever had and the rice was perfectly done. (that being said I am a super light weight when it comes to spicy food, so this was right in my wheel house) Definitely worth a visit if you are roaming for a good place to grab a unique bite to eat. I will be back

EDIT: Based on how fast and friendly the owner was in his response to my review I bumped them to 4 stars. Thanks Dana"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Hula's the other night.  I was in town for a few days on business and decided to go for the first time with a few business associates.  We had a round of Mai-Tai's which like previous reviews have stated are strong.  We actually had someone at our table request less booze which to me is refreshing.  I travel a lot and it seems like more often than not restaurants and bars are getting way to greedy when it comes to their pour.  

Our server was friendly and prompt and the food was great.  Half of our party was from the island of Maui including myself and I can say we were all surprised at the quality and taste of the poke.   As a group we shared orders of the Mahi Mahi and Ahi which everyone was surprised at really how good it tasted.  Who knew there was good fish in landlocked Arizona. 

I'll be coming back to Hula's when in Phoenix and would definitely recommend to friends and family.

Aloha,"}
{"text":"Pretty cool space with pretty delicious food. They have a fun tropical cocktail list and a decent selection of wines and beers. There are a few vegetarian options that are more tofu based than veg based, but I was happy with the flavors of my tacos. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"What a find....  trendy, friendly and fabulous.  This is the type of place that I call home. Hula's has something for everyone with Island cuisine from coast to coast and anywhere in between but still has room for a twist of the American Burger that keeps him happy.   

We found this place around the time it first opened as we were trying out the light rail.   We were not quite sure if we should go in because after bumming on the light rail all day the trendy setting threw us off.   The unique building was an eye catcher and at first we were not sure if it was a restaurant so as the explorers we are we went up to the door and then when I realized this was a restaurant we asked to see a menu.  My now Fiance took one quick look at the menu and started to walk a way and so I began to follow.  The owner Dana grabbed us and convinced us to give it a shot.  In fact he made such an impression that we have become regulars.  Dana the owner makes this place feel like cheers because every time we come in everyone knows our names.   We laugh and joke with the eclectic mix of staff who is always friendly, courteous and professional.   If that isn't enough, the prices and great food will keep you coming back.   

Yes that is the start of our love affair with a place called Hula's and it hasn't ended in all this time.  You might ask me why not because I haven't gotten to the end of the menu yet nor have I gotten all the receipts.  These are the foods that you never tire of.   I have always started with sweet potato fries with Hula's own mouth watering sauce as an appetizer because you can not go their without trying this dish.  The first year I could only eat  the Jamaican Jerk plate that was so good I use to crave it all the time.  I then ventured on to their shrimp rolls and lunch portion salads with just the right amount for lunch with friends.  I have ventured even further for happy hour with the girls I tried the ceviche, crab cakes and taco's with Dr Funk giving us his blessing with a RX for the soul.  Some of my fav's are any of the Bowl dishes, Hearty Black-bean burger and the fresh fish catch of the day.   Hula's has a perfect blend of ambiance. I always tell everyone I know that they should come in and tell them we sent you.

Did you hear now next door they have a new frozen Yogurt place called Twirl?   I have been thinking about the Red Velvet every since I visited on Friday.  I'm not sure I will ever leave.  LOL   

Eat, Live and Enjoy....  I know you will."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I am always interested in finding food places that would remind me of home.  Hula's isn't exactly what fits the bill, but it's close enough.  If I am ever in the area, I'll stop by this place again.  

The ambiance reminded me of Hotel Valley Ho in Scottsdale, so I did like the retro-modern decor.  Not so much the tiki stuff, but everything else.  Very chic and swanky looking.

The menu is reasonably priced, especially for lunch.  My friend and I were hungry for brunch typed food, so that's what we ordered.

Rice was awful, but I definitely enjoyed the \"loco-moco\" style dish of rice, black beans and eggs over easy.  But the best thing I remember from that meal:  well done Portuguese sausage!  I might just order only that next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite watering holes these days.... plus the serve up delicious food! 

First things first, the blood orange martini is AMAZING!!!!  The Pain Killer and banana drink (can't remember the name) were two other big winners with me and my friends. 
The patio is FANTASTIC, a great place to sit back and relax and the interior design of the restaurant is cool as well. 
As for the food...
here was our \"must have\" breakdown..
App: ISLAND STYLE POKE*  COCONUT ENCRUSTED 
Entree: many delicious choices but the winner at our table -  DUKE'S LUAU PORK PLATE  

SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish we lived closer so we could go to Hula's again! Chose Hula's based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We really enjoyed sitting out on the patio by the fire - fire is always a hit with my hubby. I had the pork tacos, and loved them. The pork was so flavorful, tender and yummy. I'll be trying to recreate those flavors when I get home. The black beans along side were fantastic as well. Daughter got the Mongolian beef - was different than others we've had, but still delicious. Tender chunks of meat, sauce was lighter than others, but very flavorful and enjoyable. They also had some off menu kids options, like chicken strips and grilled cheese, which was a huge help with our little one. Large menu of fruity drinks, served in cool tiki glasses, and a large wine list. Will be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Phoenix on our way back to LA (from Sedona) and we tried to find something new (besides Mexican and Italian) around the area. We stumbled upon Hula's and didn't regret it! Everything we ordered was superb: Luau Pork Sandwich, Ahi Tuna Salad, Habanero Chicken Tacos, Ahi Tuna Bowl, Calamari, Ceviche and Poké! Their seafood's so fresh and everything was flavorful!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos FTW!!!!! The drinks were pretty amazing, I won't lie! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Art is the best bartenderhis customer service  is  unbelievable ... Five star rating on this guy!!! If I was the owner he would be thaw ace!!!"}
{"text":"The poke was amazing and a good size portion to boot. Service was spotty at the bar but great in the restaurant. Tried the Tiki Bastard cocktail it was very strong and too much bourbon. The wasabi mashed potatoes are a miss, no flavor, was excited to try them.  I had the butterfish and it was well prepared. Hubby had the hapu, prepared with coconut flakes, very dry and made the fish seem overcooked. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"The decor is awesome, I remember when it was just an ugly abandon building on central, now it is an ugly with great personality building with food. 
The civiche is TO DIE FOR. Almost for that reason alone I would give 5 stars. The pulled pork is another of my favorites. I had the basic burger once, and it was not so good.
The staff have always been helpful and friendly. With its easy access off of the light rail, and great service and food, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We live down the street and anxiously awaited the unveiling of this place.  Already stoked to have Lola within walking distance,  I must admit I was less than thrilled to learn it was a \"tiki bar\". 

While walking the dog, we turned into the parking lot this fine Sunday afternoon and thought, \"what the hell?...\" so we decided to stop in and check it out.  

First, they are dog friendly on the patio and the dog bowl full of water at the entrance is very inviting.  Second, I like the sparse tables on the patio.  It beats the hell out of scrunching a bunch of oversize tables into uncomfortably small spaces (ahem...Oregano's).  

We ordered the shrimp coconut rolls and I got a Painkiller (dark rum, coco lopez, fresh squeezed pineapple and o.j.)  Delish! Although the shrimp rolls need an extra layer of flavor on the inside (red pepper? mango?) they were tasty enough.  Great app, nice portion size, plump, juicy shrimp.  The sauce is just divine.  

Next up- ahi tuna poke (aka \"crack in a bowl\").  Nice cuts of ahi marinated in a perfectly balanced soy, sesame oil with citrus hints, minced macadamia nuts, green onions and little bit o' heaven.  Seriously, couldn't stop eating it.  It was damn tasty. Tastier than toro poke at other places I've had.  

Cocktail #2- The Zombie.  The tiki glass was cute, a little too Disney/Macayo's for me and way too strong with no actual flavor.  Both my husband and I were bartenders and can appreciate a well-crafted, toxic cocktail.  However, this was lacking and not sure what could've saved it.  Our server was gracious and understanding, happily swapping that for my much-beloved Painkiller.  Mmmm.  mmmm. good. Although this time it arrived with some sprinkle of nutmeg? allspice? on top....hmmm...curious as the last one didn't have it but tasty nonetheless.  

Enjoying the ambiance and not wanting to leave, we ordered sweet potato fries.  Tasty and more crack in that sauce.  Ginger with some....crack.  It was just good. The fries not greasy, not too crispy, not soggy.  Well done. 

On to dessert.  Husband had the key lime pie and I had the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream.  Mine was \"eh\", nothing to write home about.  I'm a brownie/chocolate cake snob.  The key lime pie was tart, sweet, creamy, nice crust (suspect it was actually homemade).  

Overall, a great experience.  I love that they are in the hood, not pretentious and seem to know exactly who they are and what they want to accomplish.  We talked to the owner and this is not a \"chain\" but a collection of 3 friends who have similar concepts and invest together.  I think it's great that the attention to detail is obvious.  The space is downright lovely and it seems like a wonderful gathering for groups.  We saw several large parties (6+) handled with ease and grace.

Like any new restaurant, there are some consistency kinks to work out but I love the attitude of this place and definitely see more afternoons on the lovely patio sipping some Painkillers....hello Arizona fall."}
{"text":"So good. Came here during a business trip and the food was delicious. I had the Cajun burger. It was juicy and spicy. Ronnie was my server and he gave us great service. When I come back I will definitely go back to Hulas"}
{"text":"Happy hour! Happy hour! Happy hour!  Maybe I'm bias because I live within walking distance of Hula's but it's definitely one of my favorite Phoenix spots.  The happy hour specials here are great and the drinks are creative.  The service is always good and so is the atmosphere.  Whether hot or cold, outdoor seating is always perfect with heaters and a fire pit.  The weekend brunch is also great.  I loved the french toast.  Short of five stars only because the fish cakes seem to be hit or miss.  The first time I tried them, I fell in love.  However, each time since then they have tasted different.  New chef or recipe?"}
{"text":"Really cool spot. Food was fantastic. I had the Macadamia Nut crusted Hapu. Get the fried plantains. Made perfectly. Sweet and savory. There are many gluten free and vegetarian options as well. Fun drinks too. We opted for a fun drink too. A little crowded at times but worth it for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Great place.  Great service, great food, fun atmosphere, pet friendly (server gave my dogs an iced bowl of water) only downside is most of the cocktails are very sweet.  not my cup of tea, but if you like tropical, sweet, rum drinks this place is for you. however, the blood orange martini is a good option for people who prefer a less-sweet drink. I get it every time. love the ceviche, also get that every time. chicken sandwich, ahi caesar, lobster bisque, all great choices i have had and were delicious."}
{"text":"So happy about this addition to my 'hood!   Beautiful renovation of a long-neglected architecturally unique (odd?) building on Central.   Things are a 'happenin' Uptown! 

Had such a nice experience with our table of 7 - which turned into 8 - wait - now we have 9 - on First Friday no less!    Staff was completely accommodating to us, friendly, upbeat, fun.  The owner Dana stopped by and chatted, making sure we were having a good time. Food was great, we shared everything.   Weather was perfect for the patio.

Ahh... these are the times, this is why we live here."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars lightly but this restaurant deserves it. Not only was the food fabulous but the waitress was Wonderful. The restaurant was busy and we had a large group but you would never have known that from our waitress. We were contemplating a seaweed salad and with out being asked she brought over a sample (It was amazing by the way) Our glasses were never empty everyone's food was great tasting and great quality. 

What a fun place! The decor was funky and fun the wait staff was professional  and efficient and very casual and it was Clean. Loved it and will be going back next time I am in town and telling everyone about it.  

Great Job Hula's!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, cool atmosphere, great drinks,,an the jerk chicken was pretty darn good.. if you like drinks try the mai tai"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I went twice in the same week.  The drinks were just right and the food was mouth watering!  Everything I tried was grade A.  

Great happy hour deals Mon thru Thurs and exceptional service!!  I even go on Friday evenings for the socializing and ambiance!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't nearly as impressive as the decor, glad the service made up for it. The pineapple wine was delicious."}
{"text":"We tried twice but ugh, they can't get it right. Food and drinks are just not good. Just go to Hawaii for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks. One of the few joints in town to carry kruzan black strap rum (do try with coke!). Friendly staff and diverse city crowd. == fun. The food is good but sometimes a bit undercooked during their rushes. Go- drink... But don't eat during the rush."}
{"text":"We went back to Hula's Modern Tiki to give it a second try after the owner contacted us and provided a gift certificate since we did not have a great first experience. 

We both ordered the blood orange martinis, which I had and liked last time. They were good, and we agreed the drinks might be worth going to have. They were each $7. 

I ordered the Hula's Modern Fish Sandwich, per the owner's recommendation. I enjoyed it. It is large. The fish to bread ratio is good, and the flavor is nice. There was not overpowering cilantro on the slaw on this dish. I had sweet potato fries with it. They were somewhat soggy and not great. That dish was $12. I would eat the sandwich again. 

He had the Mongolian Beef Bowl without black beans. The rice was very sweet, but we knew that after last time. The meat was cooked well. The curry lime sauce does not resemble Mongolian Beef. The dish had a little too much cilantro. Because the flavor was not like that of a traditional Mongolian Beef, I would not order it again. It was $13. 

The server was nice and helpful, though service was much slower tonight than last time. 

All in all, we really want to like Hula's because the drinks are decent, the location is convenient and the patio is nice. However, the food is just not a huge win for us. We may return for happy hour but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time my husband and I have visited Hula's. We just moved about 3 blocks away and I am so excited to make this my regular dinner/hang out place. We went there a few months back for the first time. I looked at Yelp reviews and was worried... What people were saying was not very favorable. But we were hungry, it was Sunday night and we decided to try it. We were thrilled. Our fish was amazing and the Poke was to die for. Our server was great and we left happy, filled with a great meal and with every plan to return. Later I read the review in the New Times. That review made me think that the New Times might need a new food critic, as clearly the current one is lacking in good taste. 

After 4 times at the restaurant I feel that I am in a position to write this review. Each time our service has been amazing. I never felt like the servers were fake, trying too hard or pushy. On the contrary, they are pleasant, helpful and so nice. I have a very severe seafood allergy and was really thrilled to be reassured that my  food did not contain shellfish. Our server double checked that our order did not have anything that could possibly make our night a nightmare. The owner came to introduce himself and was a very nice guy.We felt so welcome there. The last place I felt that kind of hospitality was at Lisa G's (sad to say, Lisa G's is no more...) The atmosphere was very relaxed and in tune with the restaurant's laid-back theme. 

And now for the food... It was out of this world. The Poke appetizer has been my favorite but the fish cevice was just as good. It combined so many wonderful flavors and is now my new favorite dish at Hula's. We shared the macademia crusted Hapu. Everything was delightful. The ginger slaw was a total surprise and it worked! 

If you want a great place with a fabulous atmosphere, awesome beers (they have Drifter on tap) and amazing food go to Hula's. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hula isn't close to home for me, but after a perfect experience, I can't wait to go back and try more food! Visited for the first time on a holiday Monday for lunch and a few drinks. I had 1 pork & 1 fish taco and was very impressed. My friend had the Ahi tuna steak sandwich and was equally as impressed. I'm not a picky beer drinker, but my friend is. The bartender made some great suggestions and my friend was able to get educated and taste some great new beers! The weather was perfect for patio dining... And this open dog friendly patio is one of the best. Stop on in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We have some new friends who have never ridden the light rail.  The 4 of us decided to take a trip downtown and pick a restaurant that was an easy walk and one the we could enjoy for less than $50 a couple with a few drinks.

After doing the required internet searches we ended up at Hula's Modern Tiki on a Friday night in July.  We arrived around 6:30 and wanted to eat inside (they have a cute outdoor patio) as it was still a hot.  We were the first ones on the waiting list and created a seat at the bar.  Cute place filled with Hawaii type memorabilia.  My wife's Mai Tai was very good which can be a challenge to find in Phoenix.

We were seat in about 15 minutes.  The wait staff was adequate.  The spicy edamami was actually spicy and I ended up eating most of it.  We ordered the Ahi Taco's and the Carne Asada Taco's.  Each were two large taco's stuff with Ahi tuna and steak cooked to order.  There was enough for 3 or 4 taco's each.  Delicious.  My wife enjoyed the black bean and rice combination and she doesn't do beans.  

The concrete floors make the atmosphere a little noisy but not obnoxiously so.  The 4 us were able to carry on a \"real conversation\".  I also notice a manager type \"floating around\" obviously paying attention to the details.  It showed.  I later introduced myself to the manager (Dana) who turned out to be the owner.  I always enjoy a restaurant where the owner/manager is actively involved.

The price came in right at $40  and we all agreed we would go back again.  It would be a really fun place on the patio when the weather cools."}
{"text":"Being a native of Hawaii, I am delighted to have such a hip spot near me to enjoy fresh seafood, tropical cocktails (don't miss the Pink Bikini Martini!), and some truly Hawaiian specialties like loco moco (ground beef, rice, gravy and egg) and eggs benedict made with Spam (weekend brunch only).  Their space on Central Avenue is unique too, with its huge hexagonal window bookending the beautiful bar; this is a building that has had many incarnations over the years.  But if you want to see it, you'd better hurry, as unfortunately, the building and its surroundings are due to be demolished this summer.  Don't worry though - Hula's isn't going away, just moving to near 7th Street and Camelback."}
{"text":"Best happy hour hands down! The pink bikini martini or the pain killer are excellent drink choices and they are definately strong. I had to take the light rail home. Thank goodness the light rail stop is conveniently located a block down. The food was alright, but the drinks (very reasonably priced for happy hour) the ambiance, and the location are what make me crave more!"}
{"text":"I still love you Hula's... But us tiki people need new Hula's custom mugs, Hula's swizzle sticks and more garnishes on your drinks (Mai tai with mint)...With the word tiki in your name this shouldn't be a surprise. Since this is the only Tiki bar in Phoenix please consider my hopeful requests:) we recently enjoyed a Tiki meet up during your Wednesday all night Happy Hour.  Your food is always amazing.... And you have the best happy hour!!"}
{"text":"I love the quality of the food for the price. Many choices and the steak sandwich is my favorite!
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is fun and creative. I totally dig it. When I'm in the mood for some island food this is where I go. Awesome drinks and a lengthy menu will please anyone. The patio is great too. Only complaint is that sometimes the service leaves something to be desired. All in all I say try it, you will love the vibe."}
{"text":"I had not been to Hula's in a very long time so when some friends wanted to meet for happy hour last night I suggested we go.  How can you beat fun cocktails and all day happy hour?  We each had one drink and apps.  I had the Painkiller, my friends had a glass of wine and the Mai Tai.  For the apps we each had a pork taco, and shared the crispy coconut shrimp rolls, and hawaiian ceviche.  Service was good, we enjoyed our food and drink and went on our way.  That brings me to 1:00 am.  I woke up with the most aggressive intestinal pain I have ever experienced.  To go along with the pain I also had hot and cold flashes followed by sweats.  This morning I texted my friends to see if they had the same experience.  Both said they woke up this morning nauseous.  Was it the food or my drink, (my friends each had a sip)?  Either way, we will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal that was really that good here but do continue going back because of the atmosphere and drinks. The spicy edamame is amazing but that's  really the only thing that I've been blown away by.  The spicy tofu tacos are anything but spicy or flavorful and the jungle tofu bowl is slightly better but still boring. It's a great place to grab a drink or app though so i will continue going back but hopefully not for dinner (which I get roped into)."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice ambience, pain in the ass to get in and out of if you're driving because of light rail in middle of Central."}
{"text":"clarify - seats are resin plastic, not terrible for a patio situation. 
I am upgrading review for two reasons; my brother who was with me dogged me for the rating, he felt it was an incredible night ( he is from Denver and wishes he could drop by anytime!!) and second the owner is engaged and messaged about my experience, I always give credit when feedback is embraced and responded too. That unfortunately does not happen nearly often enough for what is really a service business. Great place, now on my top places to go across the country!! And besides, who does not love a Tiki-Bar !!!"}
{"text":"I'm just gonna do the damn thing and give this place 5 stars.... they seriously have the BEST coleslaw ever!!! I hate coleslaw and this stuff is really good. I love the cilantro in it and how it is not too saucy unlike myself."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out on the patio and imbibe. Enjoyed the inventive cocktails- both the mai tai and tiki  bastard were winners. So was the poke. The latter had a generous crumble of macadamia nuts which was a nice touch. 

The crowd was a mix.  Glad we tried it while in the neighborhood. Not sure we would go back as a destination. Good day drinking joint."}
{"text":"We went back for dinner. Fun night out!  We tried the Jerk chicken, Jerk pork, black bean burger and fish tacos. Everything was tasty. Loved my Zombie and the hubby had a One-eyed Pirate, delish. Lovely island atmosphere, I love what they have done with this building. Great all over experience. We shall return to our island in the desert again soon."}
{"text":"We went last Friday for the first time since last fall and holy crap, when did it become such a cool place to be?! We used to get a table on the awesome patio but this time had to squeeze into a tiny table inside. Oh well. Good for them!

Parking is a bitch so I found the gravel lot and hoofed it. It's ok--you don't have to wear hooker heels here to fit in.

Happy hour is a decent deal--$2 off drinks. But when the full price is just $7-9 for a mixed drink, don't feel bad if you miss the 6pm cut off! My fave is the ahi tuna burger. It's not ground up--it's a giant hunk 'o fish, cooked perfectly. I paired it with the sweet potato fries. If they're from a frozen bag, I'd be shocked. Or maybe I don't care; they at least look homemade! My girlfriend got the tacos and raved--two (plus the rice, etc.) made for a filling dinner. Portions are perfect.

Drinks are clever and super strong, so, please, get a cab. Love the mixed crowd here--everyone is welcome!"}
{"text":"Watch out, Downtown. Because Uptown's coming after you.

THE LOCATION
----------------------
Situated in a revamped geometric building dating back to 1965 (ancient time in Phoenix-speak) within the same Central Ave shopping center as Lola Coffee and Haus, directly facing the St. Francis Xavier Church basilica. Camelback/Central is the closest light rail stop.

When you first walk in, you'll notice the patio: a collection of tables and a long bar tabletop placed around a firepit. I immediately knew that this was going to be a regular evening hangout for the uptown crowd. Tonight's temperature was perfect to be outside and as it cools down further, the firepit will be even more attractive.

Inside, the main dining room had shelves lined with kitschy tiki heads overlooking the otherwise regular dining area. The bar area is much cooler, though. First off, that giant hexagonal window is awesome and I think everyone should have one in their house. I'm glad they respected the original design by keeping it. A long bar with hanging lights, as well as another long tabletop. Moving images projected high up on the inside wall, which would easily be visible while going down Central through the giant window.

MENU
---------
A limited menu today, with plans to expand it soon. A lot of Hawaiian-inspired dishes, with fish understandably being a highlight. I decided to try their island style poke (ahi, soy sauce, sesame oil, avocado, green onions, and macadamia nuts - $9) and their cocojoe chicken plate (coconut encrusted chicken breast, lilikoi sauce, plantains, black beans, and rice - $15). 

Full bar with a drink menu including a dozen plus typical tiki bar specials, including a 2-4 person Volcano Bowl. I decided to stay dry today (it's only Monday) so I'll have to imbibe some other time.

FOOD
--------
The poke - 3.3 stars. The cut and quality of the fish was nice and went down easily, and the ingredients of soy, sesame, and green onions were all there, but somehow I was a little underwhelmed by it, which was strange, since I'm a big fan of poke. Nice chunks of avocado, although the macadamia nuts were missing.

The chicken plate - 3.3 stars - The coconut-encrusted chicken breast, cut into long strips, was really nice. Cooked tender and not in the least dry. It was the highlight and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My server had warned me upon ordering that the lilikoi sauce (basically a jazzed up passionfruit puree) was REALLY sweet so instead of having the chicken smothered with it, to have it on the side. And I'm sure glad I took her advice, because it was way too sweet for my taste. I asked her if they had any other sauces that I could try and she immediately brought three others over - a mango salsa, a peanut sauce, and an ahi glaze. The latter two didn't do much for me, but the mango salsa  had the perfect amount of sweetness and complemented the chicken much better. The rice & beans were cooked jerk style and were decent, although the plantains were missing at the outset. When they came a few minutes later, they had nice warm caramelization on the outside, but unfortunately were really cold when I bit into them, as if they hadn't finished defrosting when they were fried.

As for dessert, no space in my belly for key lime pie. Next time.

SERVICE
-------------
I had the pleasure of meeting Dana, the owner. Really friendly and excited about opening up in this uptown location. He was very appreciative of my business and looking forward to integrating the restaurant into the local scene. My server was also very friendly, jovial and attentive. No complaints at all in this department. 

RANDOM INTANGIBLES
----------------------------------
Music went from 80s to chillout lounge to rock. I just remember hearing \"She Drives Me Crazy.\" You can't go wrong with Fine Young Cannibals. It's true.

The view from the patio is great, in its uptown way. Of course you have the light rail going in either direction, while the M&I Bank building emanates its capitalistic glow from up the street. I looked up at Landmark Tower and saw the silhouette of someone dancing on their balcony. Must be a fan of FYC (as well as having the Bionic Woman's hearing powers). 

FINAL VERDICT
----------------------
Seems like uptown is giving downtown a run for its money with all the openings in the past 18 months, and Hula's Modern Tiki is another welcome addition. The location is great, and I could see it having a an awesome happy hour (don't know if they're planning one), with folks hanging on the patio in the non-summer months.

Now the food may need some tweaking to be truly stellar, but to be fair, it was Day 1. There were definitely some bright spots and I'll come back to try more (the great service and friendly atmosphere didn't hurt). 

So, all in all, food + service + overall impression on its first day = 3.6 stars, rounding up to 4. As they say, onwards & upwards.

{"text":"I tried the Southwest seas fish tacos last week and they were brilliant! Perfectly blackened on the outside and soft & juicy on the inside. Paired with their rice & beans (and maybe even a cocktail), makes a perfect meal.

I brought my grandma and mom here a few weeks ago and they tried the fish specials: the pan-fried soy-misu hapu with mushrooms and the macadamia encrusted mahi with mango chutney (you can also do these specials with tofu!). $14-16 for rather brilliant fish specials is a steal! They were both overjoyed to try something new and don't think they'll be requesting Olive Garden (or the dreaded Cheesecake Factory) for their upcoming birthdays. ;) 

Our server even recommended the perfect cocktail for my grandma and took it a little easy on the tequila, per her request. The service here is consistent and now that I started eating fish again, I can reintroduce myself to all that their menu has to offer. Forever a Hula's fan."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. My first experience was lack luster, but I had only ordered a cocktail. The drink was well made, but service and atmosphere(despite being a Saturday night) was quite drab and dead. However, my friends wanted to try the all night happy hour on Wednesday. I ordered the Mai Tai- it was very well made and well priced at 6$ during HH. I also ordered a pork Taco and the house fries off the HH menu. The Taco was great, but fries were soggy. I would definitely recommend coming in during happy hour (all day Wednesday!!) you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places in the valley.  Absolutely the finest fish sandwich I've ever tasted.  I was millimeters away from ordering a second one, until I successfully resisted.  

Go for the regular fries, not the pretentious sweet potato fries.  They may be good, but the original ones are better.  Besides, everyone does the sweet potato fries nowadays! The truly unique joints do the regular cut traditional french fry well.  Yum!  Our friends got some other entrees which looked just as fantastic.

Moderately priced with good scenery.  Not to mention great service (table of 6, waitress memorized our order without error), and we kept adding more people on and she couldn't have been happier.  Splitting checks was not painful at all.

Go here and get the fish sandwich, it is something to marvel."}
{"text":"This place just never fails to delight! 
 I have been here a few times now and it is always exceptional. 
Today was another wonderful experience.

Meet a friend here for lunch I got the fish tacos.only I got one fish and one tofu.
You can mix and match. It was with a very unique rice and bean dish.
 My friend got the Tofu Curry salad. I tasted a little of hers and it was also fantastic. 
Our waiter was so nice, he even gave me a sample of the Lobster bisque. Although I did not order it, it also was good.
The water is filtered ,it does not taste like poison so that was really nice as well. 
I had hot tea (they have an assortment). He refilled it continuously. 
 One thing we noticed while we were sitting in the bar area was how clean the place was . I mean sparkling clean.  I know that may sound strange but, I was right by a corner and I noticed how it sparkled. 

The more I come here the more I like it. The bathroom is spotless and beautifully decorated. 
The place is so retro ,plus they play the best music on the P.A.
Parking was good today, not so packed. But ,sometimes it can be hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was disappointed but based on the reviews I decided to give hulas another chance for happy hour  I would say drinks only. The food was bland as just sad ex: the rice not cooked and was actually crunchy"}
{"text":"Walked into a  cozy atmosphere .  For starters I tried the shrimp rolls those were really awesome along with the pineapple sauce . For  $6 not worth for only 4 pieces.  I had one of there burgers that was suppose to be spicy.  Was hoping there would be more flavor to the the burger but couldint taste the signature sauce that was suppose to be included with it . Overall staff were friendly food was ok ."}
{"text":"within seconds of posting my review, the owner messaged me and offered to buy me tacos!! this just made me love hula's even more.  dana, i will be back- a lot, we had such a great time.  you had me at hula."}
{"text":"All day happy hour on Wednesday with the whole drink menu and some of the food at happy hour prices. 

The fries, coconut shrimp spring rolls, vegan jungle curry, dr.funk, and the blood orange martini on the rocks are all really good! 

It's a nice place to be able to be able to hang out with a small group and catch up over cocktails. Everyone loved their drinks and food. The service was great."}
{"text":"Wednesday night happy hour (which lasts until 11pm)...was relatively busy for this day/time.
Holy smokes, they're not shy with the alcohol in their drinks. After one, I was done! Seemed to be the consensus with everyone who was drinking...
Also tried the coconut shrimp rolls, which weren't too shabby. Sauce was supposed to be pineapple/horseradish, but didn't seem at all horseradishey. 
Our server (Katherine) was great! On top of refills, food orders, friendly, and fast! Bar itself was nice, was showing reruns of Gilligan's Island. Great patio seating, especially this time of year!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The island inspired decor and ambiance are spot on. The alcoholic beverages are some of my favorite in Phoenix. The steak sandwich is literally one of my favorite sandwiches in all the lands. Only gets 4 stars because I have been a little disappointed by some of the other food that I've ordered here but I would still highly recommended trying this central Phoenix gem out!!"}
{"text":"The painkiller cocktail (in the coconut glass) was aw-mazing. Food was good too. We are vegetarian so we got the veggie burger and tofu tacos, and enjoyed both. It's like a tropical vacation date night. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are an ASU fan. Apparently, other games are more important. Way to cater to your neighborhood."}
{"text":"If anyone knows me they know my love for tiki and know my love for Hulas! Me and my husband come here at least once a week for brunch and it never gets old.  The food is great, the staff is friendly, the drinks are amazing and their happy hour...well you can't find a better happy hour in town! If you find yourself in Central Phoenix and want to try a new place for some awesome grub...stop in at Hulas Modern Tiki...order some tacos....wash it down with a mai tai or a dr funk and enjoy your day!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the Mongolian beef bowl is the best!  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  Only comment is the staff should have name tags or uniforms so they are more recognizable!  Great place though!"}
{"text":"Been here before and the food was decent, this time was really good.  I got the black bean burger that comes with shiitake mushrooms, cheese (I think Jack) and awesomely good, grilled Maui onions...the bun was perfection! I added the side green salad, and that was also very tasty!  Not only did we have a great server, but each month they pick a different charity to donate to! (I think it's a percentage of their sales on Mondays).  Super cool:)

I also really love what they did with the space...I used to come to this plaza a long time ago to rent videos from Movies on Central (RIP).  They really jazzed the place up while still keeping the integrity of the original."}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese around, interesting and delicious drinks, and awesome wait staff. This is another dog-friendly gem. They have water bowls for your dogs and a huge patio that's beautiful in AZ's nicer months. The building is really architecturally interesting - it has a huge window that makes you feel like you're in the bio-dome. If you come here enough, you can definitely feel at home in this place and the wait staff will quickly become your friends."}
{"text":"I am a fan of all things Tiki - that's JUST how classy I am. After discovering Hula's during an accidental drive-by, I decided to give this place a whirl for happy hour after work on Friday night. Pulled up about 6pm with 6 of my closest friends, and was able to park easily in the attached parking lot - an unexpected surprise. The place looks very cool from the outside, and I thought the inside was Tiki-inspired enough to be fun, but not offensively cheezy. There is a large open patio area with a few tables - seemed more for casual cocktail seating, but there were also a couple of large tables out there with big groups of people. They could probably pack in a few more tables out on the patio, 'specially now that the weather is perfect for sipping umbrella-style drinks outside. I didn't get a chance to try the food, but a friend I was with gave high marks. I tried three of the fruity concoctions on the drink menu - 2 out of 3 were yummy, especially the Mai Tai, but the blood orange martini still needs some work. Not bad, just not exceptional. I didn't see any type of happy hour specials, but the prices were OK - about $7 per girly drink. Bartenders were great at suggesting drinks and were very friendly. By about 8, the bar crowd had really thinned out which was disappointing, but I'm hoping that won't be the case much longer as more people discover it. I'm looking forward to heading back."}
{"text":"I know I know i reviewed Hula already, but i can only give them 5 stars at a time and i feel they deserve 100 plus! 
It was my birthday yesterday and my pick of places to go so i picked Hula! i LOVE, love, love this place. i was lucky girl got the same waitress from before, and her name is Ginger, ask for her, beautiful, on the money with service and sweet as can be. though i am sure all the staff is like that. 
I got to meet the owner Dana, he is the warmest, sweetest man alive, really! i adore him! 
We sat outside it was beautiful, the patio had a great mix of all kinds of people, i love that, and someone had there doggy there and i really LOVE that part! I had drinks of course and there is no better place in town for drinks, hands down! They are strong, sweet and will make you go home and do dirty birdy stuff for sure! 
Dinner!!! AMAZING!!! 
I ordered fish and picked it prepared jerk style, it was sooo good, i have never had jerk style sauce but highly recommend it. it came with rice and plantains and some thing called johnny cakes i think? it was kinda like cornbread but even better i could eat it everyday! 
My b/f got the jerk chicken it was so tender and moist and all the flavors blended well together, amazing, i may have to get that next time! 
We also had a half order of sweet potato fries before dinner, HEAVEN!! and a half order was HUGE, we took some home with us as well as some of our dinner. the sauce that comes with them is sweet and tangy, get them!!! 
We also had banana cream pie. it is not like the kind you get in the store It was so damn good! it had a half graham cracker half chocolate bottom, then the banana cream part and bananas on top, my mouth was happier than it had ever been! 
Everyone NEEDS to go here, you will love it and walk away feeling full and part of a caring family. 
This is hands down my favorite place to go in Arizona! 
Ohh and i have yet to try Sunday brunch but am planning on it very soon! i wanna take doggies with so they can enjoy as well! 
Say Hi to Dana while your there he will treat you so good, he took VERY good care of me, Thanks buddy!!xoxoxox 
Go, right now! this second, ~ 

ALSO..For the reviewer Patti S.... 

Harsh, harsh, harsh..I had the Same DRINKS YOU HAD AND THEY WERE FAR FROM BITTER..REALLY? BLOOD ORANGE HAPPENS TO BE ON THE SOUR OR AS YOU PUT IT BITTER SIDE..And the Pinapple taste was there, i had PLENTY of drinks and i tasted it.. 
There is no way that you can even begin to say the rice was screwed up, really/ i had the same rice you had and it was perfect, maybe because it was not made from a boil in bag you did not realize what REAL rice is.. 
Please people disregard patty's review, it was her first one, and she is a snowbird from probably south Dakota this place is rocking and happening, and anyways who uses the word ucky/ i would not trust a review from someone \that is that bland..Yeah go back to Trader Vic's nothing like a nice chain restaurant, maybe hit Denny's in the am for breakfast...I give it 100 plus stars....you wanted to try something real and not a casserole and you were far from your safety zone Patti s, that's all, plain and simple..."}
{"text":"After some recommendations for places to eat while we're in town, I decided to venture out and see what else Phoenix has to offer. Apple Maps pointed out Hula's and after looking at some Yelp reviews, we hopped in the car and made a beeline for dinner. 

We were sat right away and we poured over the drink menu and agonized about what to try. I went with a Mai tai (it is a tiki bar after all) and my wife had the Pink Bikini Martini. The drinks flew out of the bar and were in our hands in minutes. And they were GREAT! We also tried out the Hawaiian Ceviche, made with white fish, coconut milk, onions and other deliciousness served on wonton chips. Whoa! The fish was tender, the marinade of citrus and onions all married together into something truly outstanding. 

I ordered the Luau Pork Plate and my wife had the Hapu fish, jerk style. The kitchen was on point with the pork. A generous helping of sweet pulled pork in an amazingly sticky bbq sauce with pineapple chunks filled a third of my plate. The remainder of the plate was filled with steamed white rice and Cole slaw. The slaw was a little bland, but the combination of the rice and pork was Hawaiian bliss. 

The fish my wife tried was smothered in a wonderfully spicy jerk sauce and served with fried plantains, Johnny cakes and white rice topped with a mango salsa. 

Our server was super bubbly and helpful in making recommendations on the menu and also asked the staff for things a \"tourist\" should do while we're in town. 

Check this place out if you get a chance. Great service, wonderful drinks and tasty food. Do it!"}
{"text":"We went here last week. The Crunchy Fish Bites are covered in crunchy panko and come with a  slightly spicy sauce, the mac and cheese is delicious, and the signature mai tai is nothing like a traditional mai tai, but believe the menu, which says \"strong\". It really is, but it tastes pretty good. We actually ordered three different cocktails and liked them all.
I was underwhelmed by the pork tacos, which seemed a little bland. Our waitress was great though."}
{"text":"I have been to Hula's three times now. Third time's the charm I guess, which is why I'm finally taking the time to write this review. Most people feel more inspired to yelp when something in their experience goes terribly wrong, however, I am compelled when something is exceptionally right. (third visit) I'll tell you about the first two so you understand even more why I decided to finally yelp for the first time.

First visit-Met a friend for a drink at the bar. It was kind of early, one bartender was busy cutting fruit but she seemed nice and smiley. The guy bartender that helped us was a dud. No personality, no recommendations and had a great opportunity to up sell our ticket but missed out. We called him Dopey from the 7 dwarfs. Strike one. 

Second visit-My spouse and I decided to grab dinner. It was last Tuesday night. The place was pretty slow, we stood up front waiting to be sat....when the hostess finally walked up she seemed clueless and irritated, like we were interrupting her bathroom break or something. (not a great first impression) Our server brought us waters then disappeared for about 20 minutes. By the time he returned we decided to forget the cocktails and just order dinner because we were hungry. We shared two meals, both were ok, but just OK. Spouse wanted dessert but the magician server who kept vanishing appeared with the check after our water glasses were empty and our dirty plates had been sitting in front of us for way too long. (understandable from Denny's or IHop but not a place like this) We paid,left and went to Lux instead of trying to get a dessert menu. Strike two.

Third visit-Finally something good to say. After experiences 1 and 2 I didn't care if I ever returned to Hula's but a coworker tricked me and there I was again. (too polite to refuse my coworker after I realized his choice for dinner) This time it was after a long day, I was slightly grouchy and definitely not expecting much after the last two adventures. We were greeted immediately by a smiling server. (she even opened the door for us) She sat us, showed us the \"signature\" drink menu and a \"Tiki Time\" menu. She said if we had any questions she would be happy to assist and she would return with ice water. We noticed she had several other tables that were spread throughout the restaurant but sure enough she quickly returned with water, a smile and her genuine bubbly personality (those of you who have had fake-nice service know what I mean, we can tell the difference between the two) She recommended drinks that were on happy hour so we saved money, not wasted it and told us her favorite appetizers that were sure to please for five bucks. When I asked about the beers she told me about the draft and bottle selection. I've never heard of Longboard or Drifter, she described them and even offered me samples! This chick is awesome. She recommended the Tiki Bastard to my coworker, she asked first if he liked ginger because there is ginger brew in it, he does and he loved the drink. (she is smart for asking because if he didn't like ginger, this drink would not be for him) The apps came out quickly and we had everything we needed to enjoy our time. She never made us feel rushed to decide on entrees and she was attentive but not annoying because we were, of course, talking about work. She provided excellent service throughout the entire experience and because of her we will be back. She made a lasting impression on both of us and turned my sour mood very sweet. By the way, her name is Tia. I was so impressed with the service I wonder why she wastes her customer service talent in food service but I'm sure I'm not the only guy that has tipped her more than 20 percent so it makes sense. 

Other notes:
The building is awesome, modern mixed with some vintage decor. 
Very reasonably priced.
Not sure about the music choice. 
Old videos play on the wall from a projector.
Neat fire pit on the patio.
Service sucks unless you ask for Miss Tia."}
{"text":"Favorite things: 
1. Blood Orange Martini
2. Thai Fish Cakes
3. Fish Bites
4. Cool, modern, retro decor
5. Great patio area
6. Really great bar service
7. Location

Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars: 
1. Price, however it redeems itself during happy hour!

I have a favorite drink now, and it is the Blood Orange Martini from Hula's. The Pink Bikini is good, and if you want more bang for your buck order the Zombie. Tiki drinks run about $7 or $5 during happy hour. Really great place to relax, but if you are on a budget this place can be a bank buster. The appetizers all look amazing, and I've order fish bites, thai fish cakes, and sweet potato fries. Mmm...the fish is so fresh and the dipping sauces have me swooned just as much as the BO martini. I'll frequent this place more often, but know that 3 drinks or 2 and an appetizer is gonna run me around $25...eek."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch meeting this past week.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was quite moist.  The salad on the side was presented very nicely.  Our server was attentive without being pushy.  We took a bit before we actually ordered and he was very patient."}
{"text":"(Update to my last review.) Service wasn't the best but you know what the owner rectified the situation within a day of my review on yelp honestly who does that? The dish I ordered wasn't to my liking but that's probably because I ordered the wrong item. I loved the Shrimp wantons. If you like the spicier side of food you will have to ask them to make it spicier I am not sure if they can do that. But the tastes are a mix of sweet and spicy. It's worth a try if you like trying fusion cuisine. I would go again to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Now you all know I don't really write Yelp reviews except when I feel like being a complete jackass or showing off my brilliant writing skills, but for once, this is a legit review that I just had to do.  I had been putting off having dinner with a family friend that I haven't seen for nearly a decade for a while, and he finally conned me into it.  Hey, free dinner, I'll take it.  

I've been to Hula's a few times, and it's a cool joint with a great patio.  I thought it would be a chill place to go chat and grub on tasty food.  However, it took about 3 seconds for me to realize that my friend was one of \"those\" people.  Ya know, 9000 special requests, never pleased with anything, and constantly changing their mind.  Basically, the dude that everyone just loves to be at a restaurant with.  A server's nightmare.

So as I'm sitting there trying not to smack him, it dawns on me that our waitress, Estelle, is handling this fool with as much grace as I've ever witnessed from a server........She was charming, funny, and when most servers would have tossed a drink in his face or spit on his burger, ok wait........

\"Double baco-cheese, it's for a cop.\"
\"What does that mean, you're gonna spit in it now?\"
\"Don't spit, in that cop's burger\"

\"I don't want a large Farva, I want a god damn liter of cola!\"

Sorry couldn't resist the Super Troopers reference.  Basically, she was perfect.  When he wanted a bigger lemon wedge for his water, I almost murdered him, and the only thing that stopped me was her wink, smile, and promise to him that he was about to have the best lemon wedge of his life. The food was good, but the experience in general started out daunting and Estelle was a champion.  

The next time you're headed to Hula's, I recommend that giant bowl of booze, and I also recommend checking for open tables in Estelle's section."}
{"text":"Last night I met some friends at Hula's for dinner and drinks.It is conveniently located just off Central and Camelback right in front of the light rail.Very convenient. I loved the atmosphere of this place, it was very relaxing and laid back. Our servers name was Kyle and he was super friendly and helpful with any questions we had about drinks and food. 
I ordered the pork tacos that were delicious! So full of flavor and the portion size was just right. It came with a side of white rice topped with black beans and a drizzle of sour creme. 
I live very close, within walking distance, so I will definitely be returning! Great place to enjoy cocktails and food with friends."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I always try something new and I'm hoping one of these times I'll find something I like...to date no luck"}
{"text":"I've only been to Hula's Modern Tiki during happy hour ... about 4 times in the 2.5 years I've been in Phoenix. The happy hour prices and food choices are great! The absolute best thing about their happy hour is Wednesdays happy hour is ALL NIGHT LONG! 

I hosted a happy hour for my Meetup group last week. We were originally supposed to be a party of 24, only 16 showed up. Our reservation time was 5:30pm. The staff was kind enough to let us hold the other table until almost 7:00!! We had such a good time! Some of our happy hour favorites were:

The sweet potato fries basket (or you could get them mixed with regular potato fries) I had a mix in a small size. 
The wings 
Calamari 
Coconut shrimp rolls 
The fish nuggets (I think that's what they were called) My goodness they were delicious!! 
The Mai Tai (3 was my limit). They were strong and SO tasty!! 
There's a drink with a cute little back scratcher in it. I forgot the name but there was a hit with a lot of folks on my party. 

Give Hula's a try for happy hour. You won't be disappointed. Next month we're gonna give them a try for brunch"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to like this place because with it walking distance from my apartment I was worried I would spend my whole paycheck there each week. driving by the HUGE window, and great lighting caught my attention right away. Living in Arizona I am always looking for a great new patio spot. Hulas is one of my favorite on Central, the noise of the train and the light foot traffic makes for fun people watching and the gas fire pit in the middle gives it a great feel.
Being a big fan of Sweet Potato fries I naturally ordered a basket while waiting for my burger, which comes without a side. which was OK because my friend and I just split the fries anyway. they are great, he is not a big fan of aoili, me on the other hand loved the ginger aoili dipping sauce it came with. 

I have been back to Hulas a few times and have found that ALL the appetizers are enjoyable and when purchased in a group of 4 it makes for a great place to get your night started. A scorpion or Volcano Bowl never hurts either for that \"pregame\" buzzzzz. the appetizers seem to all compliment each other perfectly.

my favorite thing to get here is the Pork sandwich....  it is a great blend of sweet and savory and the slaw adds the perfect cruch to it.
I will for sure be back, not just because it is so close, but the patio.... I cant get over this patio!!!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and was ignored by 3 bartenders, who really weren't doing anything. Finally got a beer, Didnt get asked it I wanted anything else. Cute place, customer service seriously lacking.

UPDATE:

Went again, same problem. After forever, ordered a beer upon which I was told was $4 -so gave the bartender a five -  bartender never came back and asked if we wanted anything else, even another beer AND kept my change!!! Talked to manager  (he asked if I wanted my dollar back) told him no - keep it - bartender obviously needed it more than I did. So we left. No I wont go back . . or even suggest anyone go there."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good selection of island food and drinks. We love coming back to this place in the summer. It has a nice outdoor patio with roll up doors so the indoor seating and bar is all open to the outside."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would have given this place a chance if it wasn't for the gift certificate I won earlier this year, but it was time and I was hungry. 

First out was drinks, and yes they all are fruity. I am sure you can order a standard non-fruity drink, but their signature drinks follows the theme and are blended in exotic juices. Fruity but good. 

The menu is comprehensive and has something for everyone, thats a huge plus for me.. but since I was here to try it out I went with a signature dish called something like Jawaiian Pork Jerk Plate, or something to that effect and it was in-wait for it-credible. Incredible!!

Way more food than I expected, and the meal included a generous serving of pulled pork in a jerky sauce with some kind of chutney on a bed of rice with fried plantains. And if this wasn't enough, they have their own version of some kind of freakishly delicious plantain bread that also accompanies the meal. And it all was amazing. I kid you not. 

So good meal and fruity drinks, what else? The service was great. From everyone, not only our gem of a waitress (that was super nice and professional). The whole staff is friendly. Something I don't see all too often. 

So what's the negative? Well, since I have to be harsh.. the interior isn't very cozy. It's clean and good enough, but it just doesn't have a date-feel to it. Nor do they make their dessert pies on site (I'm guessing here, but it is hard to find a negative for this place. Seriously. Have I mentioned the stellar service? Yeah, I think I did.)

When food, drinks and service converge in this way - it warms my heart and I support this local establishment to my fullest. Considering eating here - do it. I know that I will be a repeat offender, and by offender I mean customer."}
{"text":"I just went here tonight for the first time with friends and had a great experience. The ambiance was nice and the food taste pretty good and had a nice presentation. It's right off the main road of you're on the patio with cars whizzing by, but besides that I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Ehhh.

I wanted to love it.  I really did.

And then we were there.  Most of my unlove for Hula's lies in the fact that we did not feel well after consuming the food.  We gave it a great try, but it just failed to miss the mark.

Apps: coconut shrimp rolls, sweet potato fries, ceviche
Mains: pulled pork sandwich, pulled pork platter, hula's burger
Desserts: key lime pie, banana cream pie
Drinks: mai tai, hurricane, dr funk

Drinks were all awesome.  So if anything, go for the drinks.

Apps were good, nothing to write home about.  The actual meal is what i have the most issues with because I felt ill after eating it, and while the first time I though it was over indulging, my take home box of pulled pork informed me otherwise.  My body is not a fan, no matter how tasty that was.  The cole slaw they serve is quite good with the pork though; I would opt for that instead of the rice on the platter.  The banana cream pie was rich, but good.  The key lime pie was pretty bland and disappointing.

It's a small place so unless you plan on sitting outside, the wait can be a bit when they're busy."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant. Wish I remembered the name of this awesome server there, but everyone is great that we have had. Food and drinks are awesome and they have great daily specials, happy hour throughout the week."}
{"text":"This was the site for the first ever Back to Drinking UYE. Yelp friends getting together for happy hour. Wednesday is all day happy hour at Hula's so that is why Wednesday was picked this time. I called them a day before to let them know we were coming and they had no problem reserving a spot for us. I have never been here before but I have always wanted to try a Tiki place and had heard good things about this place. Everything I had heard was true. This place is great. I like the decor a lot and the Elvis movies projected on the wall was pretty cool too. I didn't even realize there was a whole other sit down area on the other side until just before I left. The staff was very nice. Our waiter, who's name I didn't catch, was very good. As people showed up he came over with ice water and asked what else they would like and was always checking up to make sure everyone was ok.
They had reserved a long table for us across from the bar and we had 12 people show up all together. Good turn out for the first one.
I like the fact that they have Longboard beer on tap. All the appetizers were very good and the drinks were good too. There were a few drinks that I personally didn't like but that was just me. The Hawaiian Ceviche was the the first app out of the gate for me. A white fish with coconut milk, chili, cilantro and garlic served with giant wonton chips. That was so good. Great way to start off and it keep getting better. Next was Spicy Thai Fish Cakes. The white fish again with cilantro, chili, red onion, fish sauces and ginger. Very tasty. Then someone said potstickers and I love potstickers so had to get some of those. When they came out I noticed that they were fried and that worried me because some times places fry them too long and they get very tough but these were just right.
I probably ate too much and drank too much because the bill was a little high but I had a great time and so did everyone else. I wasn't to thank Hula's for putting up with us. I will definitely be back and want to try more than just apps next time. I love the Tiki glasses too. They whole night was awesome and I want to thank everyone who came out. I can't wait for the next Back to Drinking UYE.
This place goes on my new list of favorite bars."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is centrally located and has a great vibe to the place. The food is always on point and the staff has always great. I get the same thing because it never disappoints! I get the Spicy Thai Chicken that has boneless chicken breast, spicy thai sauce, avocado and fried sweet plantains. Great atmosphere to go on a date night or even with the girlfriends!"}
{"text":"So my wife have been here twice now. The first time, we had went close to when they had first opened and decided to sit on the patio. What a great meal with an awesome view. We had the Island Style Poke, Crispy Shrimp Egg Rolls, Johnny Cakes and Seaweed Salad. The Poke is absolutely amazing, I could eat two or three for my meal. The crispy shrimp rolls were pretty good too. I wasn't a HUGE fan of the Johnny Cakes, but that could just be my palate. The Seaweed Salad was very good, very fresh tasting.  We decided to get takeout last night, and again went for the Poke, my wife ordered the Island Style Ceviche and I went for the luau plate. As always, the Poke was phenomenal!  My wife went nuts for the ceviche. It was different than most ceviche's I'd had, it had the acid of a traditional ceviche but the also add in coconut milk to soften the acid, it was good (but I'm not really a ceviche guy). My food could have been totally awesome. The flavor was fantastic, but the menu stated sticky rice (I'm from Seatle and a total teriyaki whore, I know me some sticky rice) and the rice was not the slightest bit sticky, and not quite finished..and room temperature. The flavor in the pork was very very good, but again it was barely room temperature (and mind you, I live only a 3 minute drive from Hula so had it been hot when I picked it up, it would still at least be warm when I got home)  The slaw was very good, very fresh. I ate the entire meal, but would like it executed better next time. Will I order the luau again? hell yeah! I also spotted a luau sandwich with slaw that I may give a shot to next time.  Overall, this is one of our new favorites in the area."}
{"text":"The black bean veggie burger is probably the most heart un-healthy veggie burger i've ever had, but it was really good. it comes smothered in carmelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, cheese and is apparently cooked on a greasy griddle. i added avocado at my server's recommendation. avocado makes everything better. 

i didn't order my own sweet potato fries, but scammed a few from a friend. the garlic aioli served with the fries was divine. i'll be back."}
{"text":"Feels like my home away from home.  They always make me feel welcomed at the bar... Thanks Keith, Jarrod and Christine :) shout out to Bailey and Andrew

You must try the edammame (sp?) and the poke!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Yummy food! Very convenient on central just south of camelback.  Love the ceviche.
This place has great Polynesian food. The happy hour is the very best with appetizers snd specialty drinks for 5 dollars each.  Wednesday is best night togo as its all night happy hour."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Hula's Modern Tiki twice, loved it! They have a great patio, attentive servers, and yummy drinks. 

Happy hour is until 6, great deals on drinks and appetizers. I have tried the shrimp rolls, pulled pork sandwich, sweet potato fries, and mai tai's. I would order them all again. Can't wait to go back and enjoy sitting by the fire outside!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour on Wednesday nights. The pink bikini martinis and the shrimp rolls are amazing. The best atmosphere is on the patio. It can be cold and loud inside and there's a lot more room outdoors. The chicken bowl is great as well."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing here.  Love the atmosphere and the drinks are the best! Try the Dr. Funk or Painkiller. Also one of my favorites for Sunday brunch, try the Hangover Hash, delicious!"}
{"text":"I have chosen to return here several times and must say each time I am more and more impressed. I have brought hordes of hungry family here as well. I must say I was and am still impressed that the owner made a change to the menu over my health concerns. Further the food here and service are always top notch. I will continue to oatronize this institution and recommend the restaurant to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great service great menu great foosd can't wait until they open in Scotsdale"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Hulas and its wonderful outdoor patio. I wish I could elaborate more, but I remember very little of that night!!
I do remember it was great and that I really enjoyed the Mai Tai's!!! 
Service was quick and friendly!!  Lovely place!!"}
{"text":"Visited Hula's for the first time today. Had no real expectations, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service, the ambiance, the menu, and the portion sizes.

The interior is very mid-century modern, which I love, and the service was outstanding. Everything was clean and dishes were removed from the table almost as quickly as I could clear them.

Ordered the Potstickers (which were delicious!!) and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, which was yummy. Nothing to write home about, but good enough that I intend to go back and explore more of the menu.

They've got a fun list of cocktails, too, if you're into that sort of thing. I'd recommend this place for sure, and I do plan to visit again in the near future."}
{"text":"Definately for the college age group.    The food was really good.   We had macadamia encrusted mani and jerk chicken.   The bowls are huge.   Great service."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fun, great service, fantastic food and quite hip!  I have been here 3 times now and every experience is wonderful!  A Painkiller (cocktail) and the Spicy Thai Fish-Cakes while we look over the menu is becoming our tradition. The two new items I tried this time were the Coconut Shrimp Rolls and split a Chicken Caesar Salad with my son (which I was dreading) but it was just as wonderful as every other dish there! The fish is always fresh and cooked to perfection in my experience.  Great ambiance too.  Whether it is after work, date night or with kids, Hula's is always a fantastic choice!"}
{"text":"This was my second experience with Hula's for brunch. Another big disappointment. I had the big breakfast sandwich. It does look really good. I ordered it specifically from seeing it on a table next to us. My companion had the hangover hash. Both were a big let down. I had the hash before so I was not surprised at that. The hashbrowns that accompanied it was I think probably the worst I have had, quite rubbery and tough. Its apparent that they had been cooked earlier in the day and kept warm until needed and maybe kissed the flattop before serving. The bread of my sandwich received similar treatment. It was toasted some time previous to serving. But by the time the bread hit the table it had lost any hint of being toasted. It looked toasted but it was soft as any plain white bread fresh out of a bag and bland. Maybe a brioche would have been a better choice. The sandwich overall was fairly bland. It could have used a little kick. Some better cheese maybe, or more flavorful bacon. Thankfully a couple slices of tomato saved the day. I will say the mimosas are cheap. Only $2 a glass. Kudos for that. Service was excellent. Very attentive. And the ambiance is great. If I hadn't tried the hashbrowns this time I may have given it 3 stars but I gotta knock em down to 2 stars due to the poor taste."}
{"text":"Fun, Fun, Fun! AND your dog can join you on the patio. Great HH prices. Love the decor. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So Jamie and I returned, as planned, for Christmas Eve at Hula's. And, as expected, it was a cozy, perfect evening.

Our server was friendly and helpful, when it came to my quandary over which new tiki drink to try(I settled on a Mai Tai, followed--after the food--by the Hawai'i 5-0. The Mai Tai was delightfully tart, while the 5-0 was fruity and refreshing.). We also got a chance to chat with the owner of Hula's, Dana, who was friendly and personable(also, seemingly the only business owner who actually reads Yelp reviews).

As for food, we shared the whitefish ceviche(a lovely bite from the citrus juices, with a melt-in-your-mouth aspect added by the coconut juice, all accented by the brightness of fresh chopped onions, chili, and cilantro). We also ordered the spicy edamame again--what can I say? I'm addicted! Jamie loved his Cajun burger and totally cleared his plate of fries(\"they were sooo perfectly crispy\"), while I ordered a (giant, $1) bowl of rice.

So, once again, Hula's has left us happy and wanting more!"}
{"text":"This is a great place, the volcano I amazing. But do you know this place this got a Grade D from the health department inspection? This is the lowest grade you can get. The have found dead roaches in the bar the last 3 inspections, food not labeled with proper dates, and not at proper temperatures.  I will avoid this place now."}
{"text":"Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink.  The food at Hula's needs to be good and consistent, not just returnable.

On a Saturday night, four of us hit Hula's at 6pm.  What's so striking when you enter is how open the bar and dining room are to the patio, which needs a few more tables and chairs, I'd say.  Central Phoenix enthusiasts love a good adaptive reuse project, and the one at Hula's, especially because of the preservation of the impressive and large hexagonal window, puts it in the same category as Postino Central and St. Francis as far as an amateur's view of architectural renovations.

We started by sharing the sweet potato fries, which are on-par with Maizie's and even those at Delux.  They were crisp, evenly cut, and intensely creamy and sweet.

After this, though, it was downhill.  Though my companions enjoyed their drinks, my Zombie, served in a tall opaque glass with a mustachioed character who looked a lot like me, was poorly mixed, lacking lime juice, and faintly soap-tasting.  The server gave me a couple minutes to weigh the drink's future, and after agreeing to suffer through it, I changed my mind and sent it back.  (The Zombie would later still appear on the bill.)  The Dark & Stormy I ordered in its place, with dark rum and ginger beer, was drinkable, but inferior to the drink of the same name at St. Francis, which, for $2 more, tastes $4 better.  I think it's in the quality of the ginger beer.

My friend's fishcakes were mostly overcooked and had to be cut with a knife, like chicken.  The ceviche, though palatable, my other friend said, appeared dry and haphazardly plated with some giant tortilla chips.

As the lone veggie in the bunch, I ordered the Spicy Tofu Tacos, which come with a spicy chili sauce and a side of rice and black beans.  Though the food came out of the kitchen quickly -- 12 minutes or so -- I wish it hadn't.  The tofu, a recently unpackaged watery brick no doubt, was merely sliced, warmed (not grilled or fried or marinated over night), and dusted with chili powder; therefore, the tofu was tasteless.  The tacos were double-wrapped in flour tortillas, which created a thick, awkward mouthfeel, so I just used one of the tortillas on each of my two tacos.  But the most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans, which are hard to screw up.  The black beans were so badly burned in the pot that even their juices saturated the scoop of rice with their charred, charcoal (bad) smoke flavor.  I mentioned this to the server, and she later would deduct half of the plate's $11 price (though the extra Zombie remained on the ticket).

We passed on dessert and went to St. Francis and later Fez for drinks.

Hula's would be a great happy hour spot on the patio if it offers consistent drinks and some happy hour food specials.  Two stars for potential, and I will try once more.  As it stands now, though, an accommodating server cannot compensate for an inconsistent bartender, burned beans, and uninventive vegetarian options.

note: I am totally aware that restaurants don't have to cater to my or other people's various dietary preferences (i.e., vegetarians and vegans), and that I choose to go to these restaurants.  I just want some rice and beans to rely on."}
{"text":"We've gone many times for Happy Hour.  Excellent drinks, get at least one Maitai.  Nice styling with the fish.  A great atmosphere and a nice outside patio."}
{"text":"Love this place! I live 20 minutes away, but my girlfriend and I go there at least twice a month.

Hula's has a great patio/bar atmosphere. They serve 4 different fish (and tofu) cooked 5 different ways. Tonight I had the Mahi with the Macadamia Nut crust preparation, which comes with a spicy mango salsa, sticky rice and coleslaw (which has something in it that makes you ask yourself how they make it!).

The restaurant is right off the Light Rail line and perfect for casual dinner with friends. Oh - and you have to try the sweet potato fries... yum!"}
{"text":"great spot in downtown phoenix.  our day drinking party got loud by this stop (#5) on the lightrail adventure.  our party didn't try any food but we did find a great mix of people in here and some nice stiff drinks.  did we need those at this point, probably not!"}
{"text":"This was a very cool hangout. It is a great place for Happy Hour with friends or even to go on a date. The food was really good too. Their sweet potato fries were soooo good. I went for a company promotion party and it seemed to be able to accommodate a lot of people."}
{"text":"Great little tiki bar! They have really great happy hour specials. Most the drinks were $5 and there was a large selection. Four or five apps on the happy hour as well. My favorite app was the ceviche. It was really good! Fresh, bold flavors, and plentiful. I also had he shrimp rolls and they were good. Tried one of someone elses pot stickers and some edamame. The splicy edamame was really good and unique. The pink bikini martini was my favorite drink. The watermellon flavor is subtle but refreshing. 

They had old Elvis movies playing on the wall the evening I went which was a fun touch. I think the patio will be a great spot this fall. Clean bathrooms, friendly, fast servers, and great new happy hour spot on my list!!"}
{"text":"After an insanely long weekend that involved work, diving and catering a baby shower (don't ask) I was in serious need of some downtime.  On a Sunday afternoon there just aren't many options, so I decided to finally try Hula's.

The atmosphere is very relaxed, which is exactly what I needed.  At 3pm the place was mostly empty, but it was obvious that the other patrons were having a great time.

I'm going to sum up my perfect, relaxing meal.  Blackened ahi with a wasabi cream sauce (damn good!), a bevy of island themed beverages and Dramarama playing in the background.  Could it get any better?

Now that I've sampled what Hula's has to offer I see the very real possibility of becoming a regular.  Bonus points for being within biking distance!

Thank you Hula's for giving me a mellow afternoon.

PS- Get the Blood Orange martini on the rocks.  You will swoon."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries is amazing, crispy on the outside(which most places can do) but super tender in the middle(which most fail).  Pulled pork is very dry...Mimosa was soso...Cole slaw (oddly enough) was my favorite as it is very unique and unlike what other places make it (def not KFC style) and not too sweet or heavy.  Taco was soso as well.  If you text them, they are suppose to give you $5 gift card, but even asking two servers, they still failed to give my a gift card, luckily I am not from this area so i don't think I will go back again..."}
{"text":"The owner odd contact me to make things right.   I do appreciate the effort.  Maybe what we experienced truly was a one off."}
{"text":"Finally decided to make a trek out to Hula's Modern Tiki for dinner! When we arrived, we noticed the very open setup. The restaurant seemed very casual & laid back, I was loving the vibe already!

After we were seated about 15 minutes later, our server came by. We put an order in for the Scorpion Bowl and the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes appetizer. It was fun to see the Scorpion bowl come out with the flaming rum float in the middle. I personally enjoy fruity drinks so I was totally on board with this drink and would get it again! The Spicy Thai Fish Cakes came out just a little bit after and they were really tasty. Not really that spicy but more so flavorful. I'd definitely recommend these!

Then, for dinner, I got an order of Hula's Baja Fish Tacos. The fish was flaky and crispy but the taco didn't pack as much flavor as I was hoping. I'd venture on to trying one of the other taco options in the future but did enjoy my meal. My husband got the Luau Pork Sandwich for his meal and enjoyed it. I tried just a bite and liked it as well!

Overall, a good experience! They have Happy Hour specials M-F from 3:30p-6:00p. I'd definitely come back, especially to try some of their other cocktail & appetizers."}
{"text":"Fish tacos! I've you read my other reviews I am a huge fan of seafood and fish tacos. I was not disappointed when I was brought her as a surprise. The Baja tacos were delightful. I also tried the spicy edamame as an appetizer, which was delicious as well. I would come here again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love a good theme restaurant, especially ones that serves awesome girly drinks in tiki-cups. 

My friend, Kelsee I, and a couple others came here for dinner on a busy Saturday night  but were seated almost immediately. The place was packed and was great to sit outside on a cold night. The heater was really hot and could have been turned down a bit.

I had the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries and side of sweet plantains. The steak was chewy so I had to cut it up in tiny pieces. I must admit that I had a late lunch so I was not hungry and should have saved room for dinner but everything tasted fine. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and my girly, Dr.Funk drink. Worked up a good buzz.

I need to come back for more. Maybe next time, I might be adventurous enough to share a giant fish bowl of booze with the table."}
{"text":"First time here and WOW, everything was delicious and the service awesome too.  I had the crispy chicken tacos, side of cole slaw, side of beans and rice and the amazing key lime pie!!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Mai-Tai was great
Max was awesome
Kool modern tiki bar"}
{"text":"I have brought so many people here and nobody has ever been disappointed!  I haven't tried one thing that I haven't liked. Every time I try something it becomes my new favorite.

Great food great atmosphere great service... What else could you ask for.

Also, don't forget to bring Fido. They have a dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the Phoenix area for 5 days and went here twice. We couldn't wait to go back and try more items on the menu and enjoy the cool vibe and great service. Our app favorites were the Hawaiian Ceviche, Samurai beef sticks and the calamari. The Blackened Mahi was amazing and the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl did not disappoint. Then there are the cocktails! Beautiful, generous and priced right - especially at happy hour. We can't wait to go back and try more selections!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TO EAT... I ate the wings... awesome! I ate mongolian beef... Awesome! I ate the Poke`... best I ever had! And I've eaten Poke` fresh in Hawaii. I ate the bbq pork... too much sauce, needs more smoke flavor but still really good. kinda picky when it comes to Hawaiian food sorry. Finish the night off Scorpion Bowl... too much ice, but it was very tasty... had 4 and also had a D.D.. be smart, Scorpion Bowls hit you fast and hard. GREAT PLACE!! Back real soon."}
{"text":"The Scorpion bowl is only $15 during happy hour - no brainer there! It's delicious and goes a long way between four people and an even longer way between two people ;)! The tacos are so good; I've had them all! The only other dish I've tried is the mac n cheese (I'm a self-proclaimed mac n cheese connoisseur) and it was very dry and burnt - DO NOT ORDER IT. Then again, I'm hoping I had a bad batch. The staff is awesome and I feel like I always see the same people working, which says a lot about management (thumbs up!). Oh, and they play old school movies on the big screen in the evenings, but you can't hear the dialogue. Overall, it's a really neat place."}
{"text":"Hmmm... so I've been to this place and have had great meals before... but this time, lunch for my girlfriends 30th bday, it wasn't as great as I remembered. The food was decent but it wasn't great for the price... the services wasn't as attentive as I would like but by no means would I call it bad. If you're interested in food with a polynesian influence... I would check it out... but if you don't have that requirement, there are better places to go in the area."}
{"text":"Wen here last nite had to wait about 45minutes.to be.seated.then had to ask to order a volcano drink bought it fast then did not see server for about 25 minutes then got to order food  ordered starters then ordered our dinner.and.everything came out at once and food got cold trying to eat everything at once then got my ice tea I was waiting for iam giving 3stars because food was good"}
{"text":"Now the reason why Hulas doesnt have a higher rating is beyond me. This place is amazing and seriously they have a hard clientele to deal with. The food is amazing and you get to dine in a upscale hipster spot for a decent price. 
The fish is always fresh and I recommend the butterfish with the coconut crust its sweet and buttery and amazing. I'm also a huge fan of the wasabi mashed potatoes. I have never had a problem with the freshness or qualitly with my burgers or steak either and they have ALWAYS been cooked to my liking as I find that alot of resturants in Phoenix will scorch the heck out of a piece of beef and then you get this black piece of grizzle and Hulas doesn't do that.

Ahh..the drinks..strong delicious cheap big. If you go with friends get the scorpion bowl its a huge bowl of liquory goodness that comes flaming with these huge straws to drink out of. The pink bikkini Martini tastes like a watermelon Jolly rancher too and its awesome. 

The waitstaff is amazing too ask for Tia and you won't be disspointed. She IS the best server and guarenteed to please, and Selena and Ron at the bar will keep you entertained and happy for hours. 

Ok now seriously 2 stars for syrup???? Are you kidding me??? Comparing crab to syrup? I have had the syrup and its awesome its REAL maple syrup and its maple and buttery so settle down and relax. If you THAT fanatic and hung up about syrup and its flavor why dont you go to IHOP on a Sunday morning and get yourself some Boisenberry and leave the good people at Hulas alone."}
{"text":"The check-in offer I received a while back is apparently invalid....aside from that this place is pretty cool.  The cocktails are fairly good especially if you are into rum, the atmosphere is vibrant, and the service is generally spot-on.  This is one of those places where the first thing I had off the menu rocked and that is all I ever order....so, I highly recommend the ceviche-yummy marinated white fish on crispy wanton chips!  When ever I am out-and-about in central Phoenix, this is always a spot I consider hitting up along the route."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to put into words how much I LOVE Hula's! I've even told my other half that if Hulas were a man, I'd marry him in a heartbeat! Everything I've eaten here has been the most delicious thing I've stuffed into my grubby little face. And don't even get me started on the cocktails. Seriously...I have nothing more to say than, go! Just go and experience the wonderful things that Hula's has to offer."}
{"text":"Consistently 5 Stars!  Never disappoints...

Have been a regular here since they opened their doors.  Pleased to see the place bustling on a Tuesday night - bet the other CenPho restaurants are jealous!

NEW MENU ITEM- Edamame appetizer, an absolute must have, the best ever (thanks to Rob, our fave hawaiian-shirt-wearing, daytime bartender/pal for introducing this to us yesterday as it's not on the new menu yet!)  - I'll never eat edamame again anywhere else, it just wouldn't compare!  5 STARS FOR THIS ITEM ALONE!!!

Thanks for being here (a nice home away from home!)"}
{"text":"I've been to the old town Scottsdale location and it's amazing, wasn't so impressed with the downtown Phoenix location though. They were pretty slow to bring the menu and pretty slow to.come back to take our order. The food was ok, nothing I would go back for though."}
{"text":"Place is awesome.  

If you're fortunate you can strike gold here on a Wednesday like myself with all day happy hour apps/drinks til 11pm.  

Ceviche was marvelous as were the shrimp rolls.

Blackened Ahi salad was divine too.

Definitely go here again when visiting Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Came for brunch...Huge portions..great drinks, fun decor.   Wil be back. The group I came with was pleased.....the only suggestion is maybe have some sauce available as a good pairing for some of the dishes, not just a hot sauce."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drove by this place on a Friday night and really wanted to try it but the wait was an hour, so we decided to come back another time. We ended up going on a Sunday night (which the server said is the slowest night) and it was dead. We got seated and although the we were a tad over dressed loved the place! We got the scorpion bowl which was only $15 and we got a good buzz  he ordered jerked pork which was amaze. It came with a side of plantains and corn bread which was a nice filler. I got the blackened wasabi ahi which was also amazing. I've been searching for some decent fish here and I finally found it!! Service was great and we got our meals very fast. Hula's for the win and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place has always had good food and good service, but in the past the service has been sort of slow when I've dined there during the lunch hour with larger groups. However, I have nothing bad to say about them after the visit I experienced this week. The food was excellent, the server was polite and attentive, and two different workers were constantly refilling drinks. On top of that, they were busy and still able to give us ample attention!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have collected tikis for years. When we moved to Phoenix and found this place we knew we were in for a treat. It is now our favorite restaurant! I love that they have vegetarian options. Spicy Tofu Tacos and a Mai Tai, yum!"}
{"text":"Albeit very far from my sector, I just heard they are opening another one in Scottsdale! I was taken here by a friend in the know (and Yelp Eliter) and we came for a few drinks but man I was regretting not being hungry because they had a great selection of appetizers I definitely need to go back to try.  Awesome decor, cool laid back vibe, great service, good prices, extensive drink list and happy hour specials.  Definitely would recommend to anyone.  Can't wait until they open in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great food we went on a Wednesday which offers happy hour all day. We decided to go with appetizers and they were all fun and delicious we ordered 8 kinds for $45.00 what a deal."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks on New Years Eve.  Our server Ginger was attentive and helpful.  The 2011 NYE proved to be dastardly cold in Phoenix, so Hula was kind enough to move us in to restaurant table (this was at 9:30ish) so our big group didn't have to freeze outside. I enjoyed the Dr. Funk and it was delicious also we sampled the sweet potato fries and thought they were great as well.  Can't wait to make it back when it is tad warmer and enjoy the awesome out door patio and the full menu. Also Hula was easily accessible by light rail, some friends of ours came that way after the suns game.  I felt it was a truly unique kind of place."}
{"text":"I'm going to be real here, I'm unimpressed by this place. 

First of all, it is not Hawaiian. Let's just get that out of the way now. Half of the menu consists of tacos! Wasabi is a common ingredient. The standard side dish is coleslaw, when everyone knows in Hawaii its macaroni salad. Let us all just agree to call this some a pan Polynesian/Pan Pacific/Southwestern /American fusion restaurant. Yeah, I find that confusing too. 

Our first trip to Hula's was unexpected. We were walking from our friend's home to Maizie's and decided we should just pop into Hula's on the way. If you are taking the LR I would suggest getting off at the Campbell stop, but I think its 6 of one, 1/2 dozen of the other between that and Camelback. If you are driving they have a huge parking lot. 

The initial visit was 4 days after they opened and we had some hits and misses with the food. I really enjoyed the fish ceviche, while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche. The shrimp rolls were a huge hit. I thought that the hapu was adequate, as was the mahi mahi. Our friend ordered a steak which was one of the grossest, grizzliest steaks I have ever seen. We left that night wanting to try it again, so we made reservations for a group of friends for my husband's birthday the following week. 

Upon our return we tried the tuna poke which was fantastic and the pulled pork sandwich which was poor, IMO. My kalua pork is a million times better. On the first visit we had tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty lackluster so we tried the plantains the second time around. The fried plantains were some of the most disgusting things that I have been served at a restaurant in a long time. I was hoping for fried plantains in chip form but they were hunks of plantains. Plantains as a non fried fruit are not really all that great, there is a reason why they are always served cooked in some way. By not splitting them up into smaller pieces the starchy flavor is overpowering. As far as food is concerned I feel that you have to really try different things to find their strengths. 

As far as drinks are concerned, get the Absolut Boston with lemonade. Thank me later. I have a PhD in mai tais and I will tell you that these are just average. They are entirely too sweet and the dark rum was not floating on the top, but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini. That is not the proper way to make a mai tai. We ordered a few volcano bowls for my husband's birthday and while they were strong, they were also very sweet. Tropical drinks don't have to be sweet! I really want a Tropical Itch or a Lava Flow but to be honest I'm not sure they offer them. 

Service is hit or miss. On his birthday my husband was wearing a birthday hat and our server actually asked him- in what I believe was complete seriousness- if it was his birthday. What? Really? 

The indoor space is great, not such a fan of the lighting on the patio. I think I will probably be back for that adult Arnold Palmer and apps. At the time we were there they didn't have a happy hour, but they have added one now."}
{"text":"Pulled pork jerk was pretty good, plantains are good , not a fan of the rice. Overall it was okay nothing spectacular. The setting and outdoor patio was nice and allows dogs."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one night for something different for dinner. It was a hip atmosphere and very social. The prices can be a bit intimidating at first and makes you question what you actually get, especially if its your first time. However, after watching plates come out from the kitchen we noticed the portions were fairly decent.

Flavors were great, service was good, drink prices were decent, its worth a stop for something different. The Pork Sandwich is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great spot on a Friday after work to grab a drink with friends or co workers, this place is \"Light Rail Friendly\" which means if you want to do a little bar hoping after a few drinks then you don't need to drive to the next bar. When I want to show off uptown phx, I bring friends to this place and everyone always enjoys this place. The happy hr is decent but the real deal is when you get a volcano bowl or spider bowl and share with a group of people. I just love the ambiance of this place and how great it is for groups of any size. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the service could be super slow and the waiters tend to forget about you. But overall I am a fan and I will be back for more good memories!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places in PHX! I recommend it to everyone visiting or moving here! Staff is always happy, hustling and energetic! Great vibe, even better drinks! Mai Tai is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here several times and I'm finally writing a review. Every single time I've been here we get great service and great drinks or food. I love that they have some sort of happy hour everyday. 
When my friend and I come here we usually just get drinks and appetizers. We've had a couple full meals here and they're great as well. I love this place as it's very well priced and a fun place to hang out. The servers always make sure we're taken care of while not making us feel rushed. 
This visit I had a few mimosas and they were great. We had the sweet potato fries and potstickers to hold us to dinner and they were super good. 
All in all, I love hula's. This is one of my favorite places to go to lounge and have a few drinks. Thanks hula's! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"So I've been hearing about this place for the  past 5-6 months since I've moved downtown. I finally made it here. It was a cold night so we sat inside. Hostess and servers were really friendly (it helps I met a regular here). I liked the ambiance inside. The drinks were great and so was the appetizers. Sweet potato fries and shrimp rolls, bomb. 

Then I had the chicken wings, they had this different taste to the sauce, not in a bad way. Hard to explain it. But I'd definitely recommend them. 

What really had me, sucked me in and will have me back. They have a projector that was playing movies onto a wall. The original Batman series, like from the 70's. Yeah, the nerd boy in me had a big O. Then after, they played the old school stop motion Christmas story movie. 

What what!!!

Oh and I just happened to find out a girl I went to high school with is a part time bartender here. Her name is Selena. She's very sweet, ask for her, great personality. 

I'm holding off on the '5th star because drinks are sorta pricy, but hey that's why Seamus isn't that far. :-P"}
{"text":"This is the least terrible place I've been in a while. Adequate price points.  Delicious food and drinks. 

Beware of the scorpion bowl! But don't worry those shrimp tacos taste just as good going down as they did coming back up."}
{"text":"DEELLISH and EXCELLENT SERVICE!  I would even say this place has a view b/c you can sit inside/outside.  I bet this place would be great for a weekday happy hour.

I took my mom and sister there for brunch on Saturday and they loved everything.  I ordered the delicious french toast, mom ordered the polynesian chicken sandwich which was a really large well cooked chicken and my sis ordered the cajun burger which was only just ok.  But the sweet potato fries were great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Ambiance is perfect for a fun dinner with the family. I can see this being a perfect spot as a gathering place with friends for drinks."}
{"text":"great drinks & environment.  the food is always full of flavor w/ a fun polynesian kick!

4 stars rather than 5 because, like a reviewer from a few weeks ago, my girlfriend and i both had upset stomaches after eating here. we've been here in the past & this was the first time that's happened, but since others have made the same comment, we're wondering if something has changed in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that (1) we did not have a reservation and (2) one of the busiest nights for restaurants, Thanksgiving eve. However, we called ahead and were told that they would try and accommodate us if we were willing to wait. And wait we did. When we arrived there was a large party occupying a table on the patio and were told that although they might be a while, we could have that table when they left. We spent 2 hours having cocktails and appetizers in the bar. When the table left, they re-set it and immediately sat two other groups even though they knew we were waiting! The manager, Kyle, knew we were waiting as he was the one I spoke with when I called, when we arrived and while we were waiting. After we complained Kyle's story changed and he said they had reservations. Not what the hostess told us when we arrived. You should have at least checked your stories first Kyle. When he realized how upset we were he set up two separate tables inside where our group would be seated apart. 

Thanks for nothing Kyle. Not how I would expect a manager to handle customer service. With so many options up and down the Central corridor, it's pretty incredible that you were willing to alienate 12 customers who were already in your establishment and spending $. You let us walk right out the door. By the way, we were calling other restaurants from your own bar and several were very willing to accommodate us which we promptly took advantage of. We will not be coming back although Keith was awesome as our server. Again, with so many options in the area, Kyle is not someone who Hula's should have representing them.

Update following Dana's response:

Dana, we did not request the patio, in fact not our first choice since it was cold and although the music was good, it was loud right next to the speakers.  We were told that we could have that particular table once they left if we were willing to wait.  Knowing we were a big group o a busy night we were willing to sit outside and also willing to wait.  And we were ordering drinks and appetizers while we were waiting in the bar area, not just taking up space.  We took an area in the bar that we were told we could have but only until the next party arrived.  

Again we were trying to work with Kyle because we were told we would be accommodated if we waited.  It was not until I questioned his seating two other parties at the table we were told we could wait for that he \"accommodated\" us, at two separated tables. I thought you would appreciate the feedback because this treatment seemed out of line. I took the time to provide you with the feedback because it is always our preference to support local businesses and I thought you would appreciate knowing how we were treated. Your response seems to deflect back on our group.  Clarifies that this was not a one time experience but more the Hula's approach towards customer service.  Not the response I would expect considering the increasing Central Phoenix options. Thanks for the response."}
{"text":"everything is delish. 
go on the weekend for $2 mimosasssss!!! 
its very trendy, a great place to just sit each and enjoy."}
{"text":"Super fun restaurant with Hawaiian based food and drinks.  Try some of the specialty  drinks and enjoy the great service and interesting food! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to Hulas Modern Tiki because I had a craving for some good Hawaiian. I tried the Kalbi ribs dish and they are amazing!! It came with rice and mac salad. I love it and we will definitely be coming back. Service was great too!"}

Happy hour is wonderful.
Location is great, as well as the lighting.
'tender finds himself in my good graces, very friendly.

All the apps are wonderful...

They even have a Justin Bieber \"look a like\" working there hahah!

My favorite place for Tuesday night...stop by and say hi!

NOTE: If your the eccentric type and search out for great restrooms...
this place and St. Francis are my favorite mid-week places.... ;p"}
{"text":"\"Ronald McDonald walked into a bar...\" (fill in inappropriate joke here).

Seriously, we turned up for happy hour at Hula's on their charity night (nice!) and Ronald McDonald was roaming the place.  I probably would have volunteered to donate extra money, just to avoid shaking hands with the semi-creepy clown... we're eating! I don't want to share the neighboring tables' germs!

We found a few cheap bites on the Happy Hour menu - Tofu and Pork tacos, Spicy Fishcakes, and Ceviche.  Considering we had already asked about the gluten-free status of a few items, we thought it would have been nice if our ceviche didn't arrive surrounded by wonton chips - at least mention them on the HH menu, so people know what to avoid!  I really enjoyed the pork taco and loved the fishcakes... YUM!  And I didn't even have to share them (yes, sometimes I use the Husband's GF status to my advantage).  His tofu taco was a little strange.  It had 3 HUGE strips of tofu, lightly seasoned and put on a corn tortilla that couldn't support their weight.  It would have been better with much smaller chunks of tofu, and not to over-do it.  You need to be able to pick up a taco, y'know?

Our waitress was friendly enough, but didn't seem particularly adept at her job.  She didn't know the ingredient in many items and our water glasses were sadly ignored.  So thirsty!

There are way too many spots in my Central Phx neighborhood that have better food and service, so it will probably be awhile before I venture back."}
{"text":"Loved the crispy coconut shrimp rolls! Got here late so we didn't get a chance to try much but it was a cool place and what we did get to try was delicious!"}
{"text":"I struggle with Hula's.  I want to like it so much and yet, every time I leave I always feel like my experience was a wash. 

The good: Their patio is killer.  It's probably one of the best in Phoenix.  They have great happy hours, especially on the weekends.  The menu has some very interesting and tasty sounding items on it.

The bad: The service is definitely only adequate.  It is easy to be forgotten about here.  Then we come to the food.  I said everything sounds great, but when it comes to taste, the flavors are just middling.  Nothing pops save for the sweet potato fries, but even those don't hold a candle to the ones at Fez or Delux.  I blame their sauces.

Given it's location, Hula's is a good place to go, but don't expect to be blown away by the food."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! A tucked away gem with great appetizers.  Overall  loved my experience.  Didn't  enjoy my overly sweet cocktail or the wine I switched to.  My salmon was way overcooked but so darn hungry at that point ate it and munched on my friends bowl which was very good.  Willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Very fresh, young, trendy vibe here. Indoor and outdoor dining experience seem to blend together fairly well, along with all the decor and lighting.

I absolutely loved the Hapu fish (Lemon Encrusted style) dish, extremely light and buttery fish, with a nice crunch to the skin. Great saucy flavor, a slight tang of pineapple and lemon, but nothing too strong. It had a nice side of cole slaw and rice. The One Eyed Pyrt was my drink ($5 happy hour!), and it was a good rum drink, which it had more alcohol though, kinda felt like I was just drinking fruit punch after a while.

Kris liked the Jamaican Jerk, but it was more like a curry styled dish, slightly spicer and style than he had envisioned. I guess I'm glad I picked a fish dish and not his dish since his stomach was trying to handle the curry hours later. 

Sadly, I was still hungry after my meal ($44 for the both of us), and was hoping for a little more food... but the actual quality and taste of the food is 5 stars, just falls 1 star short because of quantity. :/"}
{"text":"Love Hula's!  Best Mai Tai in town.  Staff is always nice and great atmosphere.  Check in on Yelp for specials."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to enjoy visits to Trader Vic's in Scottsdale, and when it closed I was tasked with the challenge of finding another place to enjoy weekend dinners and the occasional happy hour.  A google search turned up Hula's in downtown Phoenix, so we decided to try it out.  We have been back many times since that first visit, and have always enjoyed it.  The Mai Tais are great, the coconut shrinp roll appetizer is my personal favorite, and I have yet to order anything from the food menu that I have not liked.

We enjoy the kitschy mid century tiki atmosphere as well, and the old movies played quietly on the upper wall after dusk are kind of a kick.

We were excited to see the Scottsdale location open up, and tried it out twice.  It's okay but does not have the vibe of the original in Downtown Phoenix, so we will continue to make the trek.

Keep it up Hula's you have a great place and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I love the fun tiki atmosphere at Hula's, and the fact that it's great for brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner or a night out. The happy hour is also a great deal...drinks are fab. I think the fish tacos here are the best I've ever had - honestly - they are perfection in the form of a taco. Great light rail convenience factor as well! Highly recommend stopping by when you'r ein the area :-) PS on Weds happy hour is extended!"}
{"text":"We go to Hula's in a big group of about 30 people after our dodgeball league downtown on Tuesdays.  We let them know we are coming and they are always very accommodating.  All of the young 20 something servers do a good job and never have any sort of bad attitude, even though we are slamming them with a rush close to close. 

This place is not to expensive, but the outdoor area and general atmosphere is pretty cool.  Not to trendy, but enough to notice.

The Asian style chicken kabobs ( I think the menu name is something like Surfrider chicken sticks???) are to die for.  I have been here 3 times and have not gotten anything else.  A lot of others in our group seemed to have LOVED them as well.  There really are beyond delicious and very affordable.

Great Service, great food."}
{"text":"Started with a GREAT Maithai! Had the coconut shrimp rolls... both amazing! Try the Mahi Mahi blackened.. yea it is a bit spicy, but is nicely balanced with a cream drizzle over the top. Great ambiance... great drinks and food! Give it a go! Don't forget the service... friendly accommodating and really made you feel at hone. Our first time here."}
{"text":"The place itself is nicely laid out and open and airy and there was a large TV at the bar where we watched the hockey game. My issue is that this is another place that does not know what happy hour means. Either have a damn good happy Hour or just don't have one at all. They have like 20 appetizers you can order, but only five of them are \"On special\" during Happy hour and each one is 5 bucks, which is about a $2 discount from the regular menu. It is the same story on the drink specials, mostly $2 off, but at least those can be had on almost every drink. The standard for my happy hour is 1/2 half all drinks and appetizers - don't pick and choose what you want us to eat. Beyond that, the food is overpriced for this part of town as well, averaging $15 bucks for bowls and some sandwiches. The Mai tai I ordered was not Tikki style at all, in fact there was no freakin pineapple either and it was served in a cocktail glass. I guess it is their twist, but that is just twisted. The Hurricane was much better and that had some rum floating and the missing pineapple was located in this drink. If they could do better on the HH food, then its worth a return.

UPDATE:
was contacted by Dana the owner, who says \"Some items I simply can't afford to run at 1/2 price (or even a big discount) due to the ever rising rent and cost of commodities\"

Well, the recession runs both ways. You have to give a little to get a little these days. Further examining the menu, this gentleman is very tricky as lunch and dinner prices are exactly the same. At lunch, if you want fries or a side it's $2 extra for your $10 burger, but at dinner it's $12 and the side is included. Very tricky."}
{"text":"So I reviewed Hula's a couple months back with a not-so-satisfied tale of my first visit. And it's true, the first time I went our waitress did not appear very happy when we said we were skipping dinner and only doing drinks... and proceeded to ignore us most of time... but perhaps it was an off night for the poor girl. Despite that night, I did not give up on Hula's and have since been back numerous times (is it bad that it's pretty much weekly?).

Why I frequent:

- Best bean burger known to man.
- Literally every cocktail on the menu is delicious...
   and served in a funky tiki glass.
- Any dish with fish can be replaced with tofu.


...all at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"4.325
I love the ambiance of this place. It feels like a Friday night party every time. It's just HAPPY and happenin'  in here! I love sitting inside by the large glass window, or in the area where you're half in half out and the breeze gently blows, or outside by the fire pit where my pooch gets a water bowl and even sits next to me on the comfy-couchy chairs. The mood is relaxed yet lively.

I hate the jammed parking. They need a parking lot across the street and not one shared with a mini mall where an accident is just waiting to happen. Even walking through it feels like a disaster. 

Now for the food.....it's Hawaiian/Asian mix sort of....I've been here a ton and I still don't quite know where to put in on the food chain. In the past I always had the raw tuna poke. See it was so delicious I didn't venture far on the menu because I could never get enough of it. This last time it was WAY salty and WAY over seasoned with soysauce. What happened to all the fun flavors that use to be swimming in there? I also had the thai chicken wings which were fine but nothing to write home about. The ceviche was outstanding though. Great hint of lime flavor and fresh! Hubby had the kalbi short ribs and again my man of many words states \"They were good, I liked them\". I tried them and they were seasoned OK, not the kalbi I'm used to that you can't put down until you've sucked all the juice out. So from all the times I use to love this place to this last visit of slightly above average food....it use to be one of our favorite places in Phoenix so I'm sticking with 4ish stars for now."}
{"text":"Hula's is pretty awesome. The drinks are deceptively strong--I always think I'm knocking back fruit juice...until the slurring begins. The food is also good. Not amazing, but there are some really good things here. The sweet potato fries and the hangover hash are both delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very reasonable prices. The atmosphere is amazing, great service. Will recomend to my friends and will definitely come back again. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"New Favorite spot in PHX!! Everything is great"}
{"text":"Food is yummy and drinks are just as good.
The seaweed salad is one of the best I have tasted in the valley. I like mine a little more dry but the flavor is spot on. The Poke is great and I could eat it as a meal. Did I mention that the Poke taste like a little piece of Hawaiian heaven?

I had the blackened fish which was good. It had some mango salsa on it but I am not a big mango salsa fan so I had to put that to the side. The Poke alone has me hooked on this place.

The architecture of this place is pretty cool... It was different and a good topic of conversation when you're on a first date. Even the bathrooms are done up pretty nice. I like the tongue and groove wood panels that go half way up the wall. Very nice touch! Even the sink was unique. 

The only thing I did not like were the sweet potatoe pomme frites (french fries). They were soggy... and that is a personal thing... I am not a big fan of soggy fries. I like my potatoes to be croquant (Crunchy)."}
{"text":"Big fan of Hula's been a bunch of times, but finally was compelled to write a review.  Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in \"Hawaii-Mode\" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.

If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!

As far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while you're enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)"}
{"text":"Nice place, bar is open, cool and has a really cool vibe to it. It was a great way to spend the afternoon working on my stuff while having a little lunch & a beer at the bar."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings....

Pros: Surprisingly good food! I assumed the menu would be small and questionable, but the fish tacos were some of the very best I've had! Not soaked in mayo, flavor of fish coming through, spicy salsa, quality tortilla. A+

Cons: Service and atmosphere. On a relatively quiet evening we waited way too long with empty drinks to order another round, including flagging someone down. And as far as the vibes, something about the patio area felt cheap or aged, like it has been a little neglected? Can't quite put my finger on it...

Also, no blended tiki drinks was a major bummer. I asked and this was due to not having a blender. I'd recommend the bar upgrade to elevate the options on tiki drinks."}
{"text":"Last year when I ate at this place I had the mac and cheese it was delicious by the way. So I decided to try something different this year and I made a delicious decision. 

Marinated shoulder cut, grilled maui onions, shiitake mushrooms, jack cheese, spicy cajun aioli was in my Steak Sandwich and french fries on the side. Hands down the best sandwich I've had this year. 

The best place to bring friends for a drink and family dinner nights."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Hula's?  Answer, you can't. The vibe is super chill and is a fun tropical theme. Awesome section on the menu  (almost to many choices). They have some fun mixed drinks like the tropical itch (with an back scratcher) and the scorpion and great drink for two. The happy hour menu is hard to beat, the ceviche being my favorite."}
{"text":"This was our last stop on the Urban Wine Walk yesterday, and it was a great place to end the day.  Because this was our last stop, we were too late to get the wine special, however we decided to stay and grab a table on the gorgeous patio and get a (full) glass of wine.  We also ordered some sweet potato fries to munch on.

The patio was awesome and I love how the \"inside\" opened up to become an extension of the patio, or vice versa.  We were lucky enough to be experiencing one of those perfect Arizona days and I felt like I was sitting in a good friend's cute, cozy backyard . . . with table service.  Speaking of the service, no complaints from me!

The original plan was to get dinner, but the wine, fries, and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night.  I can't wait to go back (soon, to enjoy the patio) and try all of the delicious food I was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews!"}
{"text":"Hula's Modern Tiki is awesome! We went there for brunch on Sunday morning and we have zero complaints. Lets start with the all day happy hour on Saturday and Sunday.... who can be disappointed with $2.00 mimosas? They were in a small flute which went down quite quick and easy, then we went for the house made bloody mary - simply delicious!! The food was great... ahi eggs benedict & the hula hangover was what we finally decided on, but can't wait to go back to try the next thing on the menu! We were also excited to see it was on the metro-lightrail route. The architecture was cool and it was a beautiful day to sit out on the patio. We couldn't stop talking about it the rest of the day... it was yummy and a delightful experience! We highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"I had my birthday luncheon/happy hour here this past weekend  - wonderful time.  Bar staff kept my group plied with booze and food.  Unfortunately, there are still about 49 things on the menu that I haven't tried.  I guess I'll have to go back.  :)"}
{"text":"I wanted so much to love this place and tried it on multiple occasions.  But alas, it's just ok.

Service is fine.  Bartenders are friendly.  Food is solid, but not exceptional.  Never had anything bad, but never had anything memorable either.  And the cocktails always disappointed."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous building and ambiance, and thankfully they have their own parking lot! We ordered their Sweet Potato Fries, the Hapu (Hawaiian Sea Bass) Macadamia encrusted with Mango-Papaya sauce which came with rice and coleslaw, Dr. Funk (coconut rum, vodka, creme de banana and a splash of orange and pineapple juices), and the Coconut Cream Pie. And the pie is not just cream on a crust, it's layered and there's a lot of actual coconut. It was incredible!

Service was great too! We just mentioned sharing an entree when we ordered it and it came out pre-split for us, fish, rice and coleslaw! I rarely have that happen unless I specifically request dividing it. Was pleasantly surprised that they just went ahead and did it.

Everything was delicious! And reasonably priced! I was delighted even surprised by the check. Very affordable for the quality of food and location. And I love the retro theme, apparently it was inspiried by the popular tiki bars of the 50's and 60's. I especially love the classic songs they play here.

An excellent, and a very well put together place. Great for a date, or for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Hula's Modern Tiki is awesome!

Our group consisted of a bunch of friends from high school and we had the beef sticks and shrimp rolls (I think that's what they're called) and the were outstanding appetizers. 

The Blackened Wasabi Mahi with wasabi mashed potatoes and greens was very good. The wasabi will do its usual dance with your palette, but it is not so overburdening on the taste buds that it turns you off. It is quite the opposite. As a side dish, the fried plantains are just the right counter to the fish. It really complements and balances the meal. 

For dessert, the Key Lime pie and the Coconut Cream pie will make you wish you could buy each whole pie. I thought the Coconut Cream pie was probably the best I've ever tasted.

The only dish that needs to be on the menu is Spam Fried Rice, a staple in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Great for indoor seating and patio seating. Our service was fast and attentive. The food was delicious. 

An enjoyable place to be for happy hour."}
{"text":"The specials they have are amazing! Everyday there is something different! Tuesdays are 2 starters and 2 specialty drink for $20, Wednesday happy hour all night, and if you follow them on Facebook you can get \"the word of the day\" and get some pretty awesome deals. The bartender Matt is always great!"}
{"text":"I was at Hula for late night drinks on a Saturday. I had the Zombie, and it was delicious. I can't speak much to the quality of the food, but the menu was intriguing. I was satisfied and it was a lovely spot to end a restaurant/bar crawl."}
{"text":"I've only had the spicy shrimp salad.  It's pretty good, so I order it whenever I go to Hula's.  Parking is a nightmare during peak times."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Hawaiian restaurant to satisfy my craving. I called and when I asked about the the dinner plate the gentleman that helped me suggested the Jerk chicken. When I heard the cost I was a little taken back. But I decided to go along. I was not disappointed. It was the best Hawaiian food I've ever had. I wish I could remember the name if the person that helped me. Thank you. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of people. the portions where huge! Half of us liked the food, and the other half just thought it was OK. The jerk pork and chicken weren't that tasty. But the pork BBQ was great, as were the sweet potatoes and rice."}
{"text":"I live for the Mai Tai at Hulas!  Also they have some fantastic appetizers, my personal favorite is the coconut spring spring roll with a pineapple horseradish sauce.. Spectacular.  The burgers are delicious here, as is the pulled pork.  I admire that they have electric vehicle parking spots!  This truly stands out amongst the best in phoenix"}
{"text":"As a frequent patron of Hula's I figured it was about time to write a review. As other yelpers have found, based on the four star rating achieved, this place is a good find. 

Your often greeted by a man in a Hawaiian shirt with a smile and a friendly hello. If you are lucky, this is the person who will be making your drink(s), because he is one of the best bartenders in the valley. Future patrons would be wise to let him know what you like and leave the rest in his hands. 

The patio is not only spacious and comfortable, but somehow shielded from the sounds of central avenue traffic. While I certainly prefer to enjoy Hulas on the patio, the architecture of the inside is amazingly well presented, as an extension of the patio. 

The food is certainly solid with certain stand out menu items like the Poke, pulled pork and the ahi eggs benedict for brunch. Obviously being a bar, the main attraction are the libations being poured, but its important to have food that compliments the both the vibe and experience and Hula's achieves this with gusto. 

Highly recommend this place if you are in the central corridor looking to cool down on a hot afternoon or celebrating Friday night with your friends late night."}
{"text":"I've only been to Hula's for drinks on the weekend and the restaurant delivered the Hawaiian/Polynesian experience I expected. The drinks were cleverly named and affordable. Both indoor and outdoor areas are pleasantly decorated in the restaurants theme which gives you something to chat about if your date is boring you. I'd recommend Hula's for anyone looking to enjoy a few drinks with good company!"}
{"text":"From the seaweed salad to the drinks and service. This place is a jem. Food was amazing and the drinks were generous. Toi mamy favorites to list. I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadn't seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our \"we are not in a hurry vibe\" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again.
There were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size.
Second problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldn't decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn't there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me.
Overall though I give the place a B+"}
{"text":"I went here randomly last night when it ended up too late to eat where I was planning to. Best choice I could have made! The food was fantastic and the drinks were strong and absolutely delicious. The staff was great and our waiter was fantastic. If you go, ask for Andrew. We'd never been and had no idea what to get so I asked for suggestions and they were great. Everything we tried that he suggested was fantastic. 
I would seriously recommend this place to absolutely anyone and we WILL be going back. A lot."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad time at Hula.
 The drinks are some of the best mixes in the valley. Be careful though, they pack a helluva punch. 
 From the burgers to the Mongolian beef bowl to their ceviche, you can't pick a bad dish. 
 They set out to be a throwback 50's style tiki bar and they nail it. 
 But, if you really want to enjoy yourself, sit at the bar. John (the tall guy) is hands down one of the best bartenders in the valley. Somewhere the art of that job got lost. The fun, easy to talk to, quick witted bartenders have been in large part replaced with a surly, too busy to chat, cooler than you crowd that makes it hard to be a repeat customer anymore. Not at Hula. 
 Some people think that five stars are too commonly given out. I think five stars are deserved when it's a place you've recommended *first* when somebody asks you where to go downtown. Hula's been that more than once."}
{"text":"Best hawaiian I've found in Phoenix. The restaurant has a very 1950's Hawaii feel, bordering on but stopping just short of hipster. It's actually done quite well. The space is a little on the small side, so take that into consideration on Friday or Saturday. We got the last indoor table at 7pm on Tuesday.

The food and drinks are in another world. I had a Zombie which was sweet but not too sweet. The Duke's Pork was marinated and covered in their pineapple sauce.

The hostess was nowhere to be found for about 5 minutes before we were seated, and several groups came in and clogged the entry during that time. Both waiters that served us were excellent, and food came out very quick."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Pork tacos were incredible! The calamari was tender and excellent. The pork hash came heaping on the plate. Huge portions! The service was also on point. Definitely will come back. Spicy Bloody Mary's were great!"}
{"text":"Given this is Hula's 913th Yelp review, it seems that there is not much left to be said about the restaurant. 

Nonetheless, here are some notes on my recent experience there with my girlfriend and mom! 

To bring, I think that the architecture is one of Hula's best aspects. It is a modern Hawaiian open concept building. It is decorated nicely and uniquely with various lights and woods that give the customer a full sensory experience. 

Moving on, I went here during happy hour so my party just stuck with the half-priced appetizers! We order a ceviche, Hawaiian styled chicken wings, sweet potato fries and a crusted shrimp roll plate. I mainly ate the chicken wings and was quite pleased with them. The sauce offered an original flavor to a classic fish. Also, the ceviche was excellent! We scooped it with warm corn chips and were refreshed by is cool nature and flavorful/well-seasoned fish. I did not have any of the shrimp, but the sweet potato fries were good! They were your typical fries but what made the fries was the Hawaiian ranch that was served with them. 

Lastly, the service was great, and it was nice to see that most of the staff seemed to be native Hawaiians who had a passion for their culture and food! My waiters name is passing me, but he was a kind young man who was attentive and polite throughout the night.  

If you have yet to check out Hula's and are in search for some great Hawaiian fare, make sure you try it out!"}
{"text":"This place rocks and will be a new top Fave!  The delish food, the cheerful, knowledgeable waitstaff, drinks, and even the music (any place playing The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and the song \"Relax\" has my vote) was great.  Had the Blood Orange martini, Ahi Bowl, and the Sweet Potato fries.  We shared the ceviche, poke, and the calamari.  My wife also had the Mai Tai, which I tasted.  It was refreshing and not too boozy tasting, yet had plenty alcohol.   And for dessert, a great Key Lime Pie.   On a Saturday night, the age range was very eclectic--some families even seemed to be there, yet it is a good place to take a date.   Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Hula's is set to replicate that of a mod 1960's, tropical bar with old surfer movies playing on the ceiling. The atmosphere gets five stars and the staff was friendly and service excellent but the food is overpriced and the food was satisfactory. I'm a huge ahi tuna fan; however, the Island Style Poke I wasn't completely impressed with. For vegetarians the Spicy Tofu Tacos were quite tasty but I would venture out to say that if you want a fun atmosphere with tropical style drinks, then this would be the spot. I was disappointed in the wine list but Hula's has a great selection of tropical drinks served in fun glasses. A fun spot for cocktails and their happy hour goes from 4-6 with $5.00 appetizers and signature tropical drinks. I won't say I'll never go in for drinks but the food I could live without."}
{"text":"Traveling west from Columbus, Ohio with our dog we stumbled across Hula's on bringfido.com and we are so glad we did! We visited around 3pm on a Tuesday (lunch) so it wasn't very busy. Our server brought out a water dish right away (so hospitable) & he was very attentive to our needs (aka drink refills cuz it was hot af out.)
The decor is top notch, even the bathrooms. I wish there were a location in Columbus as the food is a refreshing change & their happy hour looks great! Next time I'm in PHX i will be sure to stop back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is the best!  I've heard lots of wonderful things, and it certainly lived up  to the hype.  The food was great, drinks were strong, happy hour prices were fantastic, the service was above average and the ambiance was fabulous.    I had the Pain Killer- even at Happy Hour prices, the drink was full strength and a great blend of rum and tropical flavors.  We shared two appetizers, the pork taco (it says it is one, but there is enough meat for two) and the coconut shrimp rolls.  The pork was a great blend of sweet and savory and the shrimp rolls were filled with shrimp and coconut and served with a great dipping sauce.  We rounded out our tropical get-away with a lobster bisque that was hearty, filling and full of shredded lobster.  My daughter opted for the Island Style Poke.  The menu listed it as \"market price\"- but we lucked out and they had a double shipment that they wanted to move, so it was only $5 that day.  Even so, it was a hearty serving, which she took home with her, and would be well worth paying full price.  We live in Scottsdale, but were downtown that evening.  We will definitely check out the Scottsdale location- soon."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place numerous times and have been wanting to check it out.  Ever since Trader Vic's closed at the Valley Ho I have been needing a spot that will fulfill my not-too-frequent mai tai fix. I was there on a Wed night to meet up with some business buddies and the place was doing brisk business. I think they have an all night happy hour on Wed night, which was convenient.
Its a cool set up especially when the weather is nice. Very open bar that leads out to a big patio with lots of seating. Gilligan's Island episodes playing on a large projector is a cool touch as well.
I am a big believer that a proper gentleman knows to order margs at a mexican food joint, wine at an Italian or French place and good beer and whiskey every place else. That being said, when frequenting a super kitschy tiki hut standard operating procedure is the house mai tai. Very tasty, not too sweet and a bit boozy. I also had some HH pork tacos that were massive and pretty decent for soaking up the 5 mai tais. I would go back for the patio and the aforementioned MAI TAIS."}
{"text":"Loved the place the food and the service. Heat lovers .. Do try their edamame. Everything was a pleasant surprise and I love surprises like these. Have recommended this place to so many.."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in here on a Friday night, because we had heard it was finally open and wanted to see what it was all about. We all love retro type places and things, so the idea of a new tiki bar was kind of exciting! 

Alas....it just wasn't a very good experience, even though our server was trying really hard to make it right. I would give him personally 5 stars for that. But it was just boring. I wanted it to be different, I guess. I know that the owners have worked really hard, and I can appreciate that very much. A lot of time and thought went into the decor, and it shows, if you like the watered down idea of tiki. (I liked the artwork.) There was just no....soul. When I think of tiki, I see over the top. It just seemed like another bland contemporary place to drink. Maybe if I was a young hipster I would have enjoyed it better. I asked for a daiquiri but they apparently don't do blended drinks. At a TIKI bar they don't?! I was amazed. Then they couldn't get my other drink choice right so the bartender sent a mystery drink over but didn't tell me or the server what it was. I didn't like it, and I didn't really appreciate just being thrown something randomly. I always carry the recipe for my drink with me, and even with that the bartender couldn't get it right. Also, the water we were served tasted terrible and had floaty things in it. I have very specific taste and I do know this, but I was really hoping for something better. None of us wanted to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing patio! Good drinks and delicious food. A job well done! Happy they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Finally tried the downtown location and had a good time. Food was great! Kona coffee was FANTASTIC. I tried the crispy fish tacos this time and was not disappointed. Hulas has good portion sizes and their food has great flavor. The only downside was that we had a larger party and it was freezing outside, they sat us in the furthest possible place from the heaters outside and when we asked about sitting at the long table, near the heaters, which were empty at the time, they would not let us move. We had to go get towels out of our cars to keep was."}
{"text":"Came for dinner. 

The volcano drink is a must, perfect for a couple. I loved the presentation of 151 burning in the middle. Overall the drink is great you can taste a bit of sweetness as well as a kick of alcohol.

They didn't have the jawaiian jerk chicken plate so I was disappointed with that. I ended up going with a chicken sandwich it was good. Soft bread with tender/juicy chicken. 

The atmosphere location decor is really chill. Ill definitely come back to try more items."}
{"text":"Intended to go to Mazie's but the wait was 45 min.  So we walked down to Hula's and got right in.  

The vibe is laid back and comfortable.  The decor is 50's/60's Hawaii vibe and not to busy.

Split the Coco Chicken and a side of the Johnny Cakes with my daughter and it was wonderful.  The chicken had a great flavor as did the side of rice and beans.  The Johnny Cakes are sweet and moist.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks and very \"gluten free friendly\" for those of us that must avoid it. If possible, definitely try to hit up the happy hour; it REALLY helps when the tab comes around!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and awesome!  Poke was fantastic and Ceviche was fantastic!!!  Forgot I was in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Hula's for years.  It is one of my favorite spots in midtown.  So many memories coming to Hula's.  It would either be coming with a group of friends or coming late at night to have a drink after work or coming here on dates.  What matter which time or who I was with the service is always great.  

One Wednesday's they have happy hour all night.  The menu is a decent size for being a happy hour menu. I normally get the pork tacos and a couple of Mai Tai's and I'm all set for the evening.  

On the patio they have a big fire pit that they turn during the winter months. So that you can stay warm while you are drinking and eating. I enjoy sitting by the fire pit on night to keep me warm, since I'm cold all the time. 

Last thing, if you feel like trying something different you should come to Hula's for there brunch and try the Spam Benedict.  It is amazing, I enjoy having it once in a while."}
{"text":"I came here because it was a dog friendly restaurant. The patio is quite inviting on a hot summer night. Got the macadamia encrusted hapu -- It was the most delicious fish dish I've ever had.  If there is a heaven, surely that's what they serve there. Perfectly matched with sides of cole slaw and coconut milky rice. They make a kick ass mai tai, too. I'm a connoisseur of key lime pie, and so I got it. They make it in house. It, too, was simply divine."}
{"text":"LOVED the potstickers and steak kabobs. Have been thinking about them since we had them on my birthday earlier this month... need to make time to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite for my wife and I.  I love the tiki decor, but it's classy retro cool and not overdone.  They still have a great selection of tropical drinks in tiki glasses though, some of which I recognize from the old tiki cocktail books.  You can get glasses to take home too.  It's cozy and perfect for a date or with a small group of friends.  The food is excellent with a lot of pork and seafood in Polynesian inspired dishes.  Service is good, attentive and prompt without being intrusive.  Overall, it's an excellent option when you are near downtown."}
{"text":"Last night... I decided to try out Hula's after reading the many reviews about the modern tiki. i do love the location and the building it is situated in, it's airy, bright, and inviting. Loved the fire pit on the patio, and I was tempted to request a table by the fire pit but my dinner mate wasn't feeling it, since it was quite chilly last night, and the fire was making her eyes watery. So, we chose an inside table. As service goes, our server was prompt, and helpful with making suggestions on what was best. 

We started with a basket of sweet potato fries... and I have to admit it's one of the better places on central with sweet potato fries, loved the aioli dip and I am quite a fan of the some what soggy fry and mixed in with some crispy ones, it was YUM and worth getting as to quell our appetite while waiting for our entrees. 

My friend M is a vegetarian so she opted for Black Bean burger, she's had the Black Bean burger at FEZ which is delish so she wanted to compare altho the idea of spicy tofu tacos was tempting. As for me, I opted for the lemongrass encrusted Mahi which was a recommended by our server and asked for a side of plantains to complete my meal. The table next door was served their food and it looked yummy, so M and I were looking forward to the items we ordered. 

There are restaurants out there that have visually appealing entrees but lack with the taste factor, and there are places out there that are visually, and satisfyingly appealing and makes you have daydreams after the culinary experience that you yearn for it days after. In the case of Hula's it was visually appealing but not so much a wow in the taste department. Now, it's not like it was bad but it wasn't like OMG \"this is bomb, mmmmmmmmmm, OMG... yum... I'm so getting this again... Oh when are we coming back?!?\"  either. It was ok. I was full. 

The Black Bean burger was simply described by my friend as greasy. Mind you it was her fault she failed to ask them to take off the onions but she was shocked with how much sauteed onions was slathered on the burger coupled with the melted jack, it just didn't mesh well the black bean patty in her opinion. It has lackluster appeal that when she had the uneaten half boxed up she simply forgot it because it didn't register on the yummy scale :-( 

As for my lemongrass encrusted mahi. It was good, the slaw just didn't mesh well with grilled fish. Maybe some grilled veg would have best suffice over slaw. And the plantains were not the best plantains at all, seemed kind of dry and not as ripe, was hoping it would more soft and have a little crisp to it. 

Our dinner was ok, and did come out to 3 stars, I'm not completely writing off Hula's Modern Tiki since it deserves a second try at least. But I'm not wowed by it that I am hoping I'd get back there sooner... I can wait for later when that urge arises. There's simply too many better options than Hula's like Maizie's next door or FEZ up the street. So if you haven't tried it, you oughta but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best hawaiian food I've ever had! I make it a point to eat here when I'm in town.

Their pulled pork sandwich is worth the travel. Another plus is their short ribs are DELICIOUS, most places I've gone to had dry ribs, but not here (yay). If you're in the Phoenix area looking for a place to eat, try here, I did it and glad I did."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night as I was visiting my sister in Phoenix and I had read about it on here and was intrigued. Needless to say it was disappointing. 
The pulled pork was greasy and inedible. The coleslaw tasted like mayo and was warm. This was the first time I've ever sent a meal back. It was that gross. The server wasn't in the least apologetic or surprised the pork was sent back. 
At the servers suggestion we ordered Mai Tais and were unimpressed. We also ordered ahi tacos, the ahi bowl and the spicy chicken bowl which were all just ok.  There were flies landing on our food throughout the meal. 
There was a table with 6 tipsy ladies that were so loud we could barely carry on a conversation at our table. 
With all these issues, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great little spot!

Have been here quite a few times and have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and the service is fast. Food taste wonderful and the menu is diverse and healthy. I would recommend anyone to check Hula's on Central out!"}
{"text":"Nice modern place. Has a good urban vibe. Good drinks & great food."}
{"text":"A great place to eat brunch. Nice friendly atmosphere. Good food; the French toast is my favorite, includes a delicious homemade apple/plantain compote. Also try the Hawaiian Ceviche,  a cool treat on a hot day. Delicious drinks compliment the meal, especially the blended Mimosas.  The Hula Hurricane is also delish,  all I can say is yum yum. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch especially if you are tired of the same old thing.

{"text":"This place is great, I highly recommend Hula's to anyone looking for a great experience getting food and drinks. The cocktails are on point, and the Mai Tai's in particular are second to none in the valley, probably the whole state--try the pain killer or the hula's Mai Tai and you'll be happy, gaaranz. The ambience is mellow, stylish, and everything you want in a Tiki bar/restaurant. The menu is awesome, features authentic Polynesian staples, with higher-end twists, but if that's not your thing there are classic options for all types of eaters (the Crunchy Spicy Chicken tacos and Hula's Baja Fish tacos, to name a few, are so good). Try this place out, you'll be stoked."}
{"text":"Business owner has indicated the customer service issues will be addressed with the affected employees. I appreciate the restaurateur's followup."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Phoenix and while we were driving to a museum, Hula's Modern Tiki caught the corner of my eye and made me look. It looked pretty cool. I couldn't figure out if it was a bar or a restaurant and noted that we should go there later. And that's just what we did!
We decided to go out for dinner and drove back to Hula's. We asked to be seated outside near the fire (it was a nice January night in Phoenix but a little brisk in the air, and the firepit outside took that away nicely). 
Their menu was HUGE and everything looked good. My only problem was deciding on what to get. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious. The service was excellent and the ambiance was perfect. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"I want to LOVE this place as much as my colleagues do.. The place is just okay for me. For starters, we've tried the lobster bisque, calamari, fish cakes, ceviche (a favorite), and the ahi wontons (another favorite). For the main entree, which is where the needle continued to point a neutral to below neutral, was the \"jerk\" chicken and the one of the fishes with the jamaican jerk sauce. Welp.. I've never had shredded, marinated of sorts, jerk chicken.. the outcome was unfortunate. The fish was better than the chicken, but still left me hoping for something.

I'd go back for starters or even exploring their pretty cool happy hour specials, but not in a hurry for a seated dinner.

Recommendation: Always make a reservation if you can. Also note, they do not take same day reservations."}
{"text":"I went with the Calamari Salad in which the calamari was just okay but the slaw was awesome but I had a friend go with just the Calamari App and it was barely edible in this sweet sauce that they poor all over it. I didn't have one of there cocktails though which my friends were raving about. I would give it another shot though."}
{"text":"We always love our Hula's and so does Cali. Always spot on we enjoy it every time we go!"}
{"text":"Hula's Modern Tiki is always a win!
Great indoor and outdoor seating. Wonderful island-style music that gets you relaxed and thinking that maybe there is a body of water somewhere nearby (not a chance in Phoenix).
I got the chicken skewers, which were moist and came with great dipping sauce. My husband loves the black bean burger here (a great option for vegetarians). They have good drinks and good service. We have come here alone and with friends and we always have a good time. Love the location and the mid-century modern style of the place, too! Very Mad Men, if Don Draper took a trip to Polynesia!"}
{"text":"Very casual vibe, friendly staff, nice location, good food and drinks - what's not to like about Hula's. A great place to relax and dine with friends and pretty much any place you sit is a good place - the bar, the patio, the main dining area. Parking can be a bit tricky during peak times, though."}
{"text":"Pretty good but I get mighty disappointed by jerk that doesn't melt my face off."}
{"text":"Tasty and cool, this is a welcome differentiated place in Phx.  Not many Hawaiian themed joints around, esp ones that deliver the goods.  We go for lunch often, have never made it for dinner."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place! The drinks are outstanding! We asked the bartender to make us something custom and they were great! The food is always fantastic! We went for Halloween and the band was a blast-"}
{"text":"Always good.  Great food and drinks.  Good prices and large portions.  Tacos, jerk pork, johnny cakes delicious"}
{"text":"As soon as me and my mom walked in we were greeted with a smile and the host seat us to our liking and gave us our menu. Once we sat down the waiter brought us some ice cold water to quench our thirst from the heat. We were here for the lunch hour which has plenty of good stuff for your palette. I got the Polynesian chicken sandwich and it was pretty flavorful. The chicken was perfectly charred yet tender and juicy. The pineapple was seared quite nice and the aoli was full of flavor."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for out of town guests! I only go to Hulas in the fall, winter and spring due to a limited amount of indoor space and not wanting to swelter in the summer sun. The cocktail menu is fun and extensive with unique drinking vessels. They have a variety of small bites and all of them are delicious. The burgers are tasty with good flavor. I have also frequented their Sunday Brunch. I love the Ahi Benedict it's always cooked correctly and has great flavor. I always look forward to coming back to Hula's."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I got the Jewaian Jerk Pork Plate and was not impressed. I also ordered the pink martini and it tastes like soap.... I got it replaced with Likikoi Margarita and it is much better.

The restaurant atmosphere is great though, nice outside sitting areas and cute decors."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here for  for Preston S.'s Back to Drinking UYE. I have to say I was a little skeptical about a tiki bar in the middle of Central Phoenix but I figured \"hey why not?\" And it was definitely worth the trip.

The place had a great atmosphere. The big patio outside looks like it would be great for large groups after the heat dies down. The inside was definitely not the over the top tiki room I expected. While it still had a lot of Hawaiian touches, it didn't bash me over the head with corniness like most places. Great music and was especially cool to be able to look up and watch Elvis'  Blue Hawaii projected on the wall above us.

The waiter Kyle (Since nobody else seemed to check their receipt ;p lol) was great. He was very patient with our large group, checked on our drinks often, and even got a virgin Hula Juice for the girl since she was DD in case I got a little too drink happy (Honest, she's not preggo you goof balls. I'm just a nut for rum drinks). He was even nice enough to make sure he cut the check up right for some of the other UYE attendants.

I started the night with a Mai Tai. Admittedly I am always wary about ordering mai tais at restaurants because it always ends up being some watered down fru-fru drink that looks like something a girl would drink. But the menu promised it was not your typical \"fruity mai tai\" so I decided to risk risk it. And they weren't kidding. I couldn't have gotten a better mai tai if I had gone to Luau in Hawaii. Nothing fru-fru about it and very strong. Kind of surprised there wasn't a limit on them but I wasn't going to push it after one of those. good rum and great flavor. Just the right mix of alcohol and pineapple juice.

For food we started off with the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls. They were fried perfectly with just the right amount of crisp. The vegetables and shrimp were very fresh and the coconut pineapple dipping sauce was great. Was a good size for two people but any more than that and you may want order an extra.

For dinner we shared the Shrimp Tacos. Again, props to Kyle for splitting this for us without us even asking since I completely forgot (was halfway through my mai tai by then so can you blame me?). The tacos were just okay but the salsa had a nice kick to it. From what I heard though I really need to grab one of the burgers next time I'm here.

Overall we had a great time and I can't wait to come back for more drinks and food."}
{"text":"Hula has remained to be one of my fav restaurant to go in Phoenix since my last review.

I decided to update and bump extra star because someone made a mistake on my pick-up order while its raining out and the last thing I want is to deal with this. Yup, you read that correctly. 

One of the staff took my pick-up order wrong but Hula resolve this very quickly and professionally. If I was angry or annoyed, the sincere and quick resolution diffused it effectively. In my experience with service industry, good customer service is not easy to come by. People get defensive or whatever else and make things worse. This is an example of excellent customer service."}
{"text":"When you are driving from the city, you should look for the Twist sign and sharing the parking lot is Hula's.  This place has a great vibe and I have no doubt that it would be an ideal happy hour spot.  However, I am rating it a 3-star for a two reasons:  

1) The food.  Let's face it, that is the end all be all right?  If the food is average, then I have to give it an average score (not bad... just not great either).  I had the recommended Mahi with Blackend spice and wasabi potatoes.  If you like overwhelming spice, this is your dish!  I felt the blackend spice was sufficient and I told the hostess that point.  It overwhelmed any taste of the fish itself.

2) While I thought our hostess was really nice, she needed support on a Monday night.  Drinks were slow in coming.  

So it was fun to stop by, but not sure it was worth a special trip.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review as I feel I was being a bit (or a lot) pissy the day with my 3-star rating.  I've always really like this place.  It takes an entire team of excellence to get a 5-star rating and I shouldn't have let just one bad moment define my overall experience with Hula's over the past 3 years!  It really is one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for HH especially on Wednesdays. it lasts from 3-11. Drink menu is extensive, food menu is tasty. I really liked their fish cakes, ceviche and their pork taco. The signature Mai Tai is not your average fruity Mai Tai. It had depth and complexity!!  The patio provides a cool relaxing ambience, especially this time of year I would definitely rate it a 4 out if 5. Enjoy the Photos!!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early Mothers Day lunch. For my girlfriend and her daughter.
Nice place and parking is tight, but since it was Saturday afternoon,we found a spot.
It is located right across the street from St. Francis Chruch so it is easy to find.

Good Ice Tea & lots of lemon for starters. Drinks are pretty reasonable for sure.
I ordered a Burger. It was OK ,good but the bun was just so so.
Lighty toasted, nice cheese,3 choices on the cheese.
It came with regular fries. WHen they came out they were all over cooked and had no flavor at all. I think the Oil was old.
However, our server was nice enough to switch them out and give me Sweet potato fries instead. Which were entirerly different and so much better.

The girls each got Ahi Eggs Bennie.
Of course I had a taste or 2 and they were really good.
Love the way it is decorated in here. Very Mad Man,50's 60's.
A very clean place and the Rest Rooms are as well.
Cannot believe this is my first time here. I liked it and will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. 6 months ago I ordered the macadamia encrusted that had a human hair on it. They played it off like it was nothing, and I was lucky to eat there. Tonight, I had to go again because of bday family stuff. My order was screwed up again! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Fun vibe and cool patio. Go for drinks. It's really a bar that happens to serve ok food, rather than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty decent HH or \"tiki time\" prices.  I have been there 3x and had great service once.  

Thankfully the place is so great that the lackluster service by the same waiter still had me coming back.  Much better this last time.

The Mac n Cheese is awesome!"}
{"text":"I really loved Hula's.

Decor: I think it was an old garage or fire department prior to being opened as an upscale tiki joint.  Despite being a 'modern' tiki joint, I love that they have big-screen plasmas and projection TVs playing 1950s and 1960s movies, like Jack Rabbit Slim's from \"Pulp Fiction\".

Underneath the bar is a very large and impressive collection of vintage tiki mugs.  Lots of framed posters of 1960s surf movies.  

The food was pretty good.  The drinks even better.  Hula's mai tais go down smooth and, due to the typical Phoenix heat, it's easy to get two or three.

They managed to do a really good job of mixing the upscale with the vintage tiki stuff.  
Hula's is the best tiki joint in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, drinks, ambiance and service. Just perfect! Loved my pork sandwich. The mac & cheese was delectable!  Painkiller & Dr. Funk drinks went down smooth. An extra nice treat for Mother's Day."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great happy hour deals! It's hard to find a decent happy hour now days, but Modern Tiki will be my new spot! 
There is open air seating and a patio. 
I had the pork tacos which were generous portions and only $3 each during happy hour! I also tried the $6 blood orange martini, during happy hour, which was on point! Can't wait to come back and try out some more options."}
{"text":"I was told before going not to expect much. We decided to try it anyway...unfortunately the information I received was correct.  

My wife and I both had the mahi.  

Mashed potatoes were good, vegetables weren't cooked thoroughly and were a little cold, may have had something to do with my order not being correct and having to send it back.  Fish looked like a a square filet-o-fish from McD's...  

Service was slow and we watched our server meander around with no apparent goal in mind.  And he only appeared to have our table and one other.  Not impressed with the service or the food...will not be back."}
{"text":"I just can't way enough about the service, food, and general ambience.  Besides being warmly greeted by the owner, we had a perfecf table to show our guests (who used to own their own restaurant) what we've been raving about.  And they are raving as well.  Today we had Rusty, the laid back waiter, who was WONDERFUL!  And the food...all is know is, you have to try the hapu (hawaiian fish) lemongrass encrusted with slaw and rice.  I practically licked the plate.  And guess what I found out...the ice cream shop next door, Twirl, is co-owned by Dana so you can walk over and bring it back to your table.  Thanks again for making this a GREAT evening."}
{"text":"Hula's is the Bomb and all that. 

Ask for Ginger she will rock your world. I love the BBQ ribs, tacos and the steak. Their prices are reasonable and it's usually sets the night off on the right foot.
Wasabi Mashed potatoes are delish and would HIGHLY recommend them!

Thank you Hulas for being My friendly neighborhood eatery that is close enough to stumble home from after  few too many Zombie's and Painkillers. (Both are adult beverages)"}
{"text":"Hawaiian pork tacos were really tasty!  Prompt courteous service. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"First I want to thank Hula for saving my date night.  We headed out for Postino Central for their wine and bruchetta special on a Tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait.   So we headed up central looking for an alternative. I saw Hula and remembered I've wanted to try it for while, so that's where we ended up.  I started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries.  The martini was awesome, but I have to say the fries had potential, but they weren't crispy.  For dinner I had the Jamaican jerk tofu.  It was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition.   The meal was good, the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane.  It wasn't the best place I've ever been, but I'll definitely go back. I love that there are several vegetarian options to choose from, so I'm eager to see how the other entrees turn out with tofu."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about quality! Had a party of 6 and everything was awesome. And the pork sandwich was just ugh.... freaking good. Defiantly coming here again"}
{"text":"Tiki Time! I highly recommend Hula's. The patio is fantastic with a firepit right in the middle. Happy hour (Tiki Time) features most of their drinks for only $5. The food was fabulous as well. Very casual environment, and great place to spend an afternoon on the patio."}
{"text":"Coming here with a few friends after a long week is more than relaxing. I'm not originally from AZ so Friday night crowd here is more like a nice lounge with great food. The drinks are great. The crowd is always laid back just having a good time. The staff is always very helpful. I occasionally have take out here as well and after a while the staff remembers you and have your food ready when you arrive. 

Friendly faces, cool atmosphere, mixed crowd, all calls for a great happy hour."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place.  I had to come back to get the full experience.  The retro/hawaiian feel was awesome and they were playing Forbidden Planet on the big screen, so my hubby was in geek heaven.  Drinks are great.  I had the Pink Bikini Martini and my husband the Zombie.  Wow, the Zombie is for serious drinkers, it is super strong.  I guess we are a little bit out of practice.  We'll be back for some more fun."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET A MAI TAI, it's there own creation and not what I expected!!! bartender was a total jerk but the food was decent.  Our waitress was super friendly and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Just as good as 2 years ago. Amazing food and a great atmosphere all topped off with friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"From the get-go, I've always wanted to try Hula based on the theme alone but the mixed reviews that I had heard from clients and friends had me a bit skeptical. I had been there once or twice for a Sunday margarita - and the Happy Hour would certainly entice me back - but we had never been for dinner or any longer than a half hour. We got a great spot by the fire which we absolutely loved! Such a nice touch for the patio. The patio environment is really open and the music we found to be perfectly balanced, too. 

Now...the service? Eh. That alone made me want to scrutinize but....the food? Out of this world. We over ordered (our typical fashion) and every single thing that we got was fantastic. Great portion sizes, lots of options, amazing drinks, and sweet potato fries that will leave you wanting more. And with an ice cream store next door, I'm sold. 

Our server was really great but we wish we had seen more of her. The food runner girls who did a bit of the work were certainly less than accommodating. Dairy based cream on the black beans? Ew. Put it on the menu so I will know and don't complain when we politely ask for another bowl without it. But, I have no complaints about our server in general. She was very sweet.

Can't wait to go back for Happy Hour! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I live right next to this restaurant. Tried so many times to like it but it's just not for me. This place would be fun for drinks though. It's always busy.


Oh and by the way, don't write a bad review because the owner will contact you and send you a condescending message :/"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday during the Groupon rush, took 1.5 hours to get our food, during of which we got 2 mimosas before they ran out and had to upgrade to some beverages that were quite a bit more.

Food was ok, but considering the reviews prior I was a little let down. 
On one hand I can expect that things might have been off because of how busy they were but on the other hand that should be expected and planned for. 

As a Chandler resident we might make it back, but we will see."}
{"text":"This restaurant allows your pup on the patio and has some of the greatest martinis in town! The staff is also super friendly and attentive. ((: ."}
{"text":"Hula's has captured perfectly that hip, urban, midtown Phoenix atmosphere. You'll always find a crowd, their fire pit is pretty interesting, the indoor and outdoor spaces are cool, and they've got posters of old surf movies on the wall in the bathrooms. I was once inspired to try and find one of them, but wasn't able to on Netflix or Amazon. Maybe I just wasn't really that dedicated to the task at hand though.

I've been to Hula's a number of times now and only about half of my visits I was ordering food. Not to say their food isn't appetizing, just that Hulas works well as both bar AND grill, and I'm not always out during lunch or dinner. While a bit on the upper end of my dining out price range, every time I've ordered food, it was either good or delicious, but when ordering a drink, I usually stick with a vodka & soda, their other drinks just aren't for me.

Their signature cocktails are generally made with either rum, tequila, or vodka, or some mixture of two or three of them, but I've found that a lot of them are to sweet for my tastes. I'm not a real fan of super sweet drinks, and they can reach levels of excessive in my opinion. My favorite food item on their menu are the pork taco's and you can order one taco during happy hour for about $3. HH is Monday - Friday until about 6pm. I've also had their sweet potato fries, tofu taco, edamame, a Hula Burger, and their mac-n-cheese. All were tasty, and worth coming back for, but I imagine I'll try something different next time, like their habanero chicken tacos or their house made black bean burger.

Overall Hula's is a fun spot to meet with friends, but I wouldn't go here for more than one or two cocktails unless you're looking to leave with a sugar high.

Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After leaving my bad review Dana was gracious enough to contact me, which to me goes a long way. So I wanted to add this bonus review that I do love Hula's for happy hour. I will go back someday for actual dining and try it again."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying we are from LA and we are moving down here. Keith was our server and he was absolutely amazing. He made our first visit so pleasant. The food here was great. The drinks are tasty. We will be returning and when we do it will be with our family. Thanks so much Keith."}
{"text":"stopped by this past weekend for drinks and food. tried the habanero chicken tacos and they were awesome! my wife had some tofu dish with jungle curry sauce and fried plantains. i am a total meat eater but i loved what she ordered. i would tell you what we drank but that stuff was so good and strong i had forgotten what they were called. we will definitely go back sometime soon. fun atmosphere and great service. also a good place for a date or hanging with the friends."}
{"text":"Ugh. Two days in a row of failure. The menu sounds incredible. Fresh. Fun. Tropical. Not heavy. Perfect for this hot weather... But alas the flavor burst I was expecting from the described flavors was not there. I ordered the macadamia crusted red snapper. Snake is a pretty mild fish, firm, and not too risky. Well. The macadamias were burned. The fish was suuuper fishy tasting. The coleslaw is perfect in texture and consistency, but literally tastes like nothing. And my rice, albeit good plain rice was actually the highlight of my meal. The mango salsa was mushy and not vibrant like it needed to be. The service was good. No empty cups waiting refills. Just nothing to get excited about and while I love the concept both mine and my husbands dishes were lacking. Fortunately, we have a dog so my 20 dollar fish wasn't wasted."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday in mid october. We had been wanting to try this place forever so we decided to make this dream into a reality. Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations.

Environment- I would give an A. First  I will say it is beautifully laid out! It was around 8pm on a Saturday night, so there were tons of people having dinner over drinks with good company. The hostesses were really nice and I was expecting a pretty good night.

Server- He was pleasant, he gave my boyfriend and I \"space\" which was nice BUT it was annoying having to track him down for refills and changes to our order. Like I said, he was nice but could have been more attentive 

Food- Nothing special at all. For appatizers we did fish cakes and potstickers which had tons of flavor.  I also ordered a side of plantains, unfortunately they were still frozen when I bit into them so I sent them back.  I ordered tacos and my boyfriend ordered jawaiian jerk chicken plate, we both agreed our food was bland and mediocre at best. Because it was his birthday I also ordered him a warm brownie which was on the dry and hard side.

Overall, the environment is great but the service and food left something to be desired. I would only return for maybe drinks during  happy hour at the bar.

DINNER TOTAL: $54.15"}
{"text":"Their jerk chicken is pretty good! My husband and i enjoyed their food on a late night when we flew in. I had to dock a star for the drinks because it was very average... I was hoping a \"tiki\" joint would have more fun, fruity cocktails"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Hula's Modern Tiki. The restaurant is smaller than one would think (especially from pictures) and parking can be a nightmare during peak dinning hours. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, i'll definitely go back when the weathers a little warmer to enjoy the patio seating."}
{"text":"Great service is just as important as quality food and Tia S. was a great waitress! Very patient with my 1st time guests as they questioned which items were best, attentive to never empty water glasses, and just generally super nice and sweet. I hope we get her next time :-)"}
{"text":"We really like the atmosphere here! My Hangover Hash was top notch but my wife's spicy tofu tacos were extremely bland and she didn't eat half of it. The service was top notch as well! FYI their fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"You take the good, you take the bad, 
you take them both and there you have... Hula's Modern Tiki.

The rare moments I'm craving a strong, fruity, Rum fueled cocktail this is the spot to hit. The drinks are well crafted but the food and service is hit or miss. The patio is one of my favorite in the valley, but a nice patio does not make for a 4+ star experience. They're packed all the time so they must be doing something right, though it certainly isn't the Ahi Sashimi. I know, I know... don't even ask why we would attempt sashimi at Hulas. I'm embarrassed enough as it is. This 'starter' was literally two bites of food. Two bites of mediocre food for $9 mind you. I was told by my orthodontist years ago that I have a very small mouth (go ahead, there's a punch line in there somewhere) so it's not like I have some Real Housewives of The Underworld hoover mouth and no idea what a starter portion should look like. We both actually looked at each other and laughed when it was placed in front of us. I'm a tapas girl, I love small plate dining, this was just a bit extreme. The pork tacos on the other hand were excellent. Filling, well seasoned and tender; the comedy of the sashimi became a distant memory. 

We will definitely return. As I stated the patio is beautiful and weather permitting, worth a trip on it's own for Happy Hour. Play it safe with you're dining decisions and you'll walk out with a buzz and a full belly.


Post script: 
In response to the owner comment, I should clarify that my hesitation in ordering ahi sashimi at this establishment is not at ALL in reference to grade or quality of product but more of a 'hindsight' situation, meaning in retrospect, it's doubtful that it would be a good representation of Hula's as a whole."}
{"text":"The tuna poke is great. Unfortunately it's a dinner item so sometimes they don't have it for lunch."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time and finally go around to it this weekend. It was the perfect weather to enjoy on their patio. The patio really makes the place. We sat there and started with the abalone style calamari. I was really good- long strips of calamari flash fried and sitting in an amazing sauce. For dinner I had the butterfish miso-style and it was  pretty good as well. The coleslaw and rice left much to be desired however. My honey had the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was good-the sundried tomato aioli spread really made the sandwich. The fries were good, but not as good as other places and the dipping sauce was just ok. 

All in all it was a solid dinner.  I want to go back and try more things. it isn't on my list of favorites but I really think Hula's has great potential. And I would definitely hit it up for happy hour."}
{"text":"restaurant is Deeeeeeeeelish! 

i come here ALL the time with my \"husband\" and we LOVE their hula burgers SO much. we also got their Mac n cheese which is delish too!
I love the drinks so much. we come here after walking the dog, or anytime really. the place is so good to hangout with friends. the happy hour menu is good & cheap
you should come here. it's very good. get their hula burger!!"}
{"text":"I went to Hula's Modern Tiki with my partner.  We were surprised with the renovations and the cool additions to this unique old building.  We decided to sit outside on the patio next to the fire pit.  The weather was beautiful.  It was a perfect night.  The garage door walls were open so the entire restaurant was exposed.  It made for a great setting.

I ordered a Blood Orange Martini to start the evening.  It was juicy goodness and I couldn't taste the alcohol which means it is probably lethal. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers, the Seaweed Salad which was tasty and the Poke which was great.  It was great because the order comes with a ton of sashimi.  The avocados and the other fixings were blended perfectly.  I fogot I was eating raw fish.  Order the Poke.

For our main dishes, my partner ordered Pan Fried Hapu.  He ate the fish then nudged the salad and the rice and bean around his plate.  He wasn't happy.  I ordered the Shrimp Tacos with rice and black beans and a side of Plantains.  The tacos were good, very nice.  The rice and beans were bland.  Which is okay for me when it comes to rice and beans.  The Plantains were awesome.  Delicious.

For dessert I ordered the Banana coconut creme pie.  In a word, \"Heaven\"

Hula's creates a nice atmosphere.  I am giving it three stars because I wasn't blown away.  I will be back and may update my review.  I would like to give it four stars one day."}
{"text":"Well Dang I guess I wont be first to review haha.....

Apparently Hula's reputation precedes it.  The fun vintage atmosphere combined with an excellent wait staff, good mix of cocktails, and a great fairly diverse menu makes this place a 5 star in my books.....

Fun Vintage converted Garage (I think?) a nice older notstalgia with a modern twist the name says it all.....

I ordered a Griled Mahi Sandwich, Court ordered a Cheeseburger (we are creatures of habit)......let me tell you it may have been one of the best meals I have ever had.....literally.

The drinks were very well mixed (yes it was the middle of the day but were no drunks...) Just strong enough but you could taste the layers....and they knew how to make a fogcutter which is a staple of 1950's Tiki bars.

Sweet potato fries with Wasabi Ranch Dipping sauce gets extra point for being unique (as if 5 stars wasn't enough).

I do think the food has quite a sophisticated taste for being pretty much Burgers and Fries....it was a great lunch although I have heard this place gets elbow to elbow at night and on weekends.......best to hit it up when its not so bust IMHO.

Great Value, Great Food, Great Service = Zero Complaints...."}
{"text":"I have had two meals here and have had most of the appetizers on the menu, I think everything was well done, the food was great! Try the shredded pork BBQ tacos!! YUMMY!!! Omg the Shrimp egg roll to die for, NO JOKE! I had the Tiki Bastard cocktail very tasty also had the Pain KIller which had a little too much ice, but it was good, I feel the atmosphere is very laid back and the service was really good we had a large group and Misty our server was on it! 
I do like that the menu is on the smaller and uncomplicated side, the decor is fun and the big screen with classic movies A WINNER!! The fire pit is a welcoming sign of fall in Arizona, I like this place, it will get better and better I am sure of it! 
I cant forget to mention the prices for the quality of the food and great service the prices are very low,try it!!"}
{"text":"Super Hawaiian Food. Restaurant Ambiance and Style gets a 5 star, very catchy and modern. Might go again once."}
{"text":"I guess they don't season the Hula Burger because they use the same patty for the Cajun burger and that burger would be salty.  So heads up - get the Cajun burger if you're gonna try one.  And they also said they leave the fat content high for flavor, fyi."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and food is never disappointing. Fills up fast but they still find a way to get you in fast."}
{"text":"My partner and I went there for the first time and we were a bit confused on how to get a table. Once we realized that we had to go inside, where the hostess stand is, we were immediately started. Or server was very friendly and suggested some appetizers. I love, LOVE, the spicy edamame and she enjoyed the fish bites. The drinks are on point! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came to Hula's Modern Tiki for the first time with high hopes just to be disappointed and let down. First, we started off with a small appetizer, the Abalone Style Calamari. I've been to numerous restaurants/bars and ordered calamari and have never been so displeased with an appetizer like the one they had served. Slimy calamari strips that were piled on one another with a lime-ginger cream sauce and soy glaze. They really should consider, renaming it \"slimy calamari strips\" or something. Second, to go along with my appetizer, I ordered one of there signature cocktails which was the \"zombie.\" This cocktail was watered down with ice and hardly had any flavor \"just not worth it\". Last, the entrée; Teriyaki Rib eye Steak. When you order a steak, your hopes that, it's a whole steak. Instead at Hula's, you end up again with strips. This time around your steak is cut up in strips and served in a teriyaki sauce (what am I? Five?). I just don't understand why a steak is served in strips. With all that being said, the staff was friendly and our waitress was exceptional. Note: Bartender and Chef need to try harder."}
{"text":"Hula's is a great place to hang out with delicious food and drinks. The blood orange martini is my favorite. The Hawaiian food is very tasty. I have been here a few times already as this has become a regular stop for my husband and me. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun place with great food & drinks! :)"}
{"text":"I have passed this place many a time, mostly when they are closed. So last week after my in-home massage, it was finally the right time. I didn't feel like doing anything but eating and chilling. On our walk over the place looked very inviting. I'm a patio person, so they had me at the entry point. They have so many tables and chairs in their humongous patio! My favorite sitcom, Gilligan's Island, was playing on the tube in the bar area and the Tiki torches were lit. It was a nice ambiance with the big fire pit, kinda felt like I was in Hawaii, except for the metro in the backdrop (oh how I love thee Metro!). It was around 7:30pm and there were a few people sporadically place around the fire pit, so it was sure to be a great night. 

I was in the mood for fish tacos and had the Hapu fish tacos (delicate white fish) which was served with black beans, topped with a drizzle of sour cream, both served atop white rice $13. Most of my food was served just lukewarm, but i overlooked it and piled the salt on the rice and beans after my first taste. It tasted much better with salt, even though I'm not really a salt girl anymore. 

The fish tacos were kinda pricey but i figured it must be DELICIOUS. The rest of the menu was a little higher than usual, especially when the food is served by a food server with a dirty white kitchen towel slung over his shoulder. I cringed when I noticed my sisters Ceviche chips were touching that nasty towel. He noticed me notice it, then left the chips on the plate and brought out a little dish with fresh chips. That was too much for me, because in a fish restaurant you never know what kind of stuff ends up on them there rags, but it wasn't my plate and she was okay with it, so we moved on. The spring mixed salad was an instant fav, with its shredded daikon root vegetable tasting so deo and the delicious ginger dressing. It was the first time I had been served a spring mix with romaine lettuce thrown in the mix. I didn't let a bit go to waste. The fish tacos were drizzled with a sweet dressing over the slaw of cabbage and it was a little weird for me, as i'm used to having a tasty salsa drizzled over the tacos with some citrus. I cut the fish in halves and made two tacos into four. I guess for the amount of slaw the price was on the money, but I wan't too happy with the rag touching the food. Other than that a touch back when the food is dropped off might not happen so make sure you ask for all you need at the order. I will definitely be back, but next time i'm sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"awesome happy hour today at Hula's! We had the margaritas,blood orange martini in the rocks and cran mimosas. All delicious! Great apps as well at a great price! Service was superb and everyone was super warm and friendly! My son just moved a block away and this will be our HH spot for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a neat place.  I was taken here for lunch for Admin Professionals Day (a day early) and it was so nice.  I love the indoor/outdoor seating (big garage doors open up to create this open and airy walk thru space).

I had the Modern Tiki Fish Sandwich.  Everything was excellent.  The cole slaw, which I am not normally a fan of, added a wonderful tangy crunch to the sandwich.

The ice tea was always being refilled, the staff was very friendly and quick to offer suggestions when those in our party were stuck deciding on 2 different items.  

A real winner.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff... I had a Mai Tai.. which was very good.. sometimes they are too sweet but this one was perfect!  For appetizers we ordered the ahi sashimi and spicy seaweed salad.  The salad had a nice kick and the ahi was awesome.. so good we had another order of it.  It was better than any I have had at a sushi place recently.  
For dinner we had the butterfish pan fried with a mushroom sauce, rice and subsituted sauteed spinach for slaw.... very yummy and not over cooked.... also had the ribs.. pretty good too.  
The patio had a nice atmosphere and misters :)
Great experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Great spot to bring friends as you can start here with dinner and a \"painkiller\" rum drink. Make sure you get it loaded up with a Kraken floater for the full effect. 

Then just stumble across the street to Patties!

If you are really going for it and have another to share with get the Scorpion Bowl!

Also a fan of this place when they open up the whole front of the building when the weather is nice. It makes it feel liek every seat in the place is in a covered patio."}
{"text":"I stopped by Hula's for dinner last evening after finding that the Breadfruit, Lola, and Pizzeria Bianco are closed on Sundays. wtf. Damn it.

My waitress was attentive. My drink was stiff like last time. And my fish again was so so... This time I ordered the macadamia fish served with a white fish (you choose). I also had the sweet potato french fries. 

The food simply is not good. I hope the owner reads these reviews and adjusts accordingly.

I will continue to come back as this is a local neighborhood restaurant for me. However, I'm going to lower its rating from 4 to 3 stars.

Note: This restaurant  definitely is worth a try. It's got a good vibe, and service is excellent. However, for 20-30 bucks, I expect better tasting food. I am convinced the management still is ironing out the kinks."}
{"text":"This place could be 5 stars if it changed a few things.  The menu is ok and my food came out tasteing pretty good.  The ambiance is awsome.  Love the indoor out door set up.  You can even bring your dog onto the patio.  The bartenders all seem really pretentious.  The owner should send them over to Ve Bene in Ahwatukee to see how a good bartender interacts with their patrons. They don't offer any drink specials at night and drinking there can get pricey.  I guess that's why they are always pretty slow when I drive by.  Maybe they think they are keeping out the riff raff. ;o)"}
{"text":"Dr. Funk was soooo good I went online and watched the Hula's video on how to make this drink myself and ordered glasses at retro store.  This will most certainly be my summer drink.  The prices were good and the food was delish as well - had a thai chicken bowl and ahi ceaser salad with mango.  I said I wish we had a Hula's in San Diego and was told there is a place downtown, but only serves drinks called False Idol.  I feel I had quite an experience at Hula's and hope to return soon.  Parking was easy and nearby shopping fun too.  We got here early and beat the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"Great food and great cocktails. Be careful on how many of the cocktails you have.. they may be fruity but they do pack a punch! (no pun intended)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, drinks great price and most of all, great service. Will return here when I return to Phoneix."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. We use to be huge fans of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries (the fries rock). Unfortunately, they removed the Ahi Tuna burger from the menu which was very disappointing. I do like the Tiki fish sandwich though. I do which that they would included a fish sandwich on their lunch menu on the weekend. Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me. 

I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Mary's and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything. All three of us sent them back and they could remake them because they were part of a batch that they pre-mixed - UGH! Plus, I was the only one that liked my breakfast. My husband and friend were not impressed. 

Also, I adore their Hawaiian fish ceviche - yum!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband.  I had the tofu asian vegetable salad.  It was just okay.  The salad was fairly expensive- over $11.  It was pretty small.  I was laughing about it having the word vegetable in it because it contained lettuce, carrots and tomatoes with wontons and fried tofu.  Since tomatoe is a fruit that means the vegetable salad contains exactly two vegetables.

My husband got a pork taco with rice and beans.  He very much enjoyed his.

I will not go out of my way to eat here again and I certainly would never order that salad again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food & drinks. Sweet Potato fries, shrimp rolls and the Hawaiian chicken are all my faves!"}
{"text":"Nah so much Hulas. Nah so much. While I appreciate their bar, I don't appreciate the food. The entrees were not good. The only thing edible was the tuna poke. That's about it. Try aloha kitchen, it worth the drive."}
{"text":"Found this place by happy accident!
The parking is sparse but it is also right off the light rail.
The decor is retro Hawaiian feel. 
Quick service.
Quality and quantity of food for price is excellent.
Pineapple mimosa was refreshing and just right - a bit sweet and a bit fizzy
Husband ordered the Hula burger with bacon with a side of Hawaiian mac salad. The mac salad is not your typical hawaii mac salad but it is tasty and I enjoyed it. - Raised in Hawaii, I am a picky mac salad person. 
I ordered the Luau Pork sandwich topped with Asian slaw and a side of sweet potato fries. Pork was sweet but not too sweet and a the slaw had a nice hint of ginger.
The orders came quickly.  
I would like to have tried the coconut creme pie but the lunches were large and had no room for dessert.  A good excuse to go back!
Bathroom are roomy, decorated in the same hipster retro style and CLEAN!
Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. The restaurant was a bit loud, the drinks are mostly comprised of rum."}
{"text":"This place was great! My review is based on drinks ONLY. We went to a BBQ joint down the road for dinner and decided to hit this place for a nightcap on our first night in town to unwind. Great choice. We stumbled upon Happy Hour (which lasts until 11pm on Wednesdays) and each had two great drinks.  I'm talking drinks on par with some of the best mixology bars in Chicago - for half the price. We sat outside next to the outdoor firepit and it was the perfect environment.  The staff was excellent, the music was great, and the diverse mix of people sitting in the outdoor patio was friendly and fun.  It's a couple blocks from the Light Rail station so we were back at our hotel in no time."}
{"text":"What a gem.  Everything here is delicious.  Get a scorpion bowl.  Get the ceviche.  The spicy ahi salad is bomb but very spicy.  If you aren't feelin' the spice get the mango chicken salad.  The service is great here.  The outdoor area is one of the best patios in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Ahi Tuna appetizer was fresh and wontons crispy. 

Had the pork sandwich. Cole slaw was delicious and the meat was even better! I had the macaroni salad as the aide, a bit too bland for my taste. 

Friendly service."}
{"text":"So. Hula's Modern Tiki... 

I was at Hula's MT the night I met Porn Star Ron Jeremy.

I was at Hula's MT the night I found out how to forgive a family member for murdering their lesbian lover in their sleep in Nebraska. 

I was at Hula's MT the really inspiring time I heard that song from the movie Rad, Send Me an Angel (by Real Life, 1989). 

I was at Hula's MT the time I witnessed a family of four drink 5 Volcano bowls. 

I've written there. 

I've been cold. 

Hot. 

I've seen Keely there probably 100 times. 

I've ordered things not on the menu and found no phlegmy aftertaste. 

I've had a birthday party there.

I've been to a birthday party there. I fell into a wall after leaving there. 

I've had caffeinated beer there. I've had un(not de)caffeinated beer there.

I've found it to be delicious and drunk. 

Get the black been burger. You're welcome. 

Get the Scorpion Bowl. Don't drink and drive. Do have a pulled back hair holder."}
{"text":"Just tried Hulas for the first time.  We are staying in Scottsdale but thought we would try something different in Phoenix, had our 2 teenage sons with us, ages 14and 17.  I had the Hula's Hurricane and my husband the Mai tai. And both were really good.  For dinner I had the luau pork platter, my husband had jerk chicken, my younger son had the teriyaki chicken sandwich, and my older son, a very picky eater, actually ate and enjoyed the Mac and cheese,  oh, and our starter was the coconut shrimp rolls.

We had a young man named William as our server, and he did a great job.  We were still in time for happy hour, which was great.  Liked the casual vib and decor.  They had heaters out in the Plato, but we chose to sit inside.  

We will definitely return for another meal the next time we are in town.  There is nothing like this in Albuquerque!"}
{"text":"Because I woke up this morning with a message from the owner of Hula apologizing and explaining the yelp check in offer ...I will up my star rating and say that even with the harshness of a curt waitress... All deserve second chances. I appreciate a heart felt explanation. I do not love or even LIKE negativity nor many negative reviews. This is a cool place in a up and coming area. SO I will Hula back in at a later time and see if the service is friendlier.. Maybe I will splurge and grab some of those sweet apps I saw passing my table.. Thanks Dana for your comment and message. :-) 


LOVE the location and I have had brunch here with my friends who fav this place several times. Tonight before heading down to Bliss to our Dinner Club we stopped off for some pre-dinner-club happy hour. He had a martini and I had a red wine. No apps. He ordered another drink of some concoction and inquired about the app menu then opted not. We sat out on the patio. Staff was nice and Hulas was hopping. I had a yelp check in offer and the waitress refused to honor it and stated I could get Hula Bucks for next time since it was happy hour. I did point out that at no place on the yelp offer did it say that. Her attitude changed and our bill came. None of these 'Hula Bucks' were in our bill, so I asked her for them. She said at that point, \"Well can you not just use the yelp offer next time?\" Ummmmm.... ???? \" That isn't what you offered before..\" I said. She huffily gave the bucks she offered. We were on our way. Dang girl.. its a mere 10% off...Maybe it comes off her salary? Def changed my opinion. I don't want her bucks because with that... I doubt I would go back unless my friends insisted.... Hula that."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly thrilled by this place. When we were seated, I took a gander at the menu, which seemed a tad pricey. The ambiance was nice, though. I spotted on the menu where you could sign up for texts and save, so I did. The text I received said if I told my server, I'd receive $5 off my first purchase. I did this, and my waiter started telling me drink specials, so I ordered one. Once I went to settle the tab, the waiter explained that my drink special had voided the $5 off, which was never explained to me beforehand. I was disappointed with this. The food was decent, but not memorable enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because it had the best margarita on the block, delicious food, excellent staff and outdoor dog friendly seating and yes, that's my little Yorkie in the pictures.

Back to the Margarita.... I ordered the Lilikoi Margarita, yum! Was so good! I'm not big on the sweet drink thing so this was my choice.
My friend ordered the \"Dr. Funk\" which was very good too but too sweet for me perfect for her.

For food, we had the pork pot stickers which were delicious. The sauces were both really good. Also had the Surfrider Chicken sticks which were nice and juicy and delicious as well.

We shared our entree and went with the Jerk Pork. Too spicy for my friend but was perfect for me. The plantain was perfectly sweet but I was kind of sad there was only 2 pieces which left me with only one piece since we split the dish. Plantains are cheap enough so not sure why they didn't give more. Plantains help break up the spicy jerk flavor, if they put more on the plate it would be perfect! 

Finished off the meal with some macadamia nut ice cream. Very good! We chose not to go with the brownie and they had no problem with that.

Very friendly staff and they had no problem making things the way you want it.


All in all it's a great little place to sit around, drink your drinks and munch on some food."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was not disappointed. I had the chicken sandwich which was delicious. The potstickers were yummy. My boyfriend enjoyed the Cajun burger and sweet potato fries. Cute establishment and attentive service. Definitely makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"Good drinks and good food-
Garlic Edamame was delicious 
Chicken bowl was amazing
Chicken tacos were good
Beef bowl has a lot a yellow curry flavor but still good"}
{"text":"There's not a lot of Tiki culture here other than the name and a few Tiki glasses but the food is da kine! It may have been just my server, Hayley, but service was the best I have ever had. Very attentive, kind and helpful. 

I normally  don't eat blackened fish as I feel the fish is too often over seasoned and overcooked, but I ordered a perfect blackened medium rare ahi sandwich. The taco slaw gave the soft almost raw warmed fish a perfect crunch. I am from Miami and never expected such a great piece of fish in the desert. 

And dessert, the brownie sundae was everything I like. Warm, not overly sweet, chocolatey moist brownies with great vanilla ice cream. Papa oo mao mao to my tummy."}
{"text":"I had a very late lunch earlier in the day and stopped by Hula's Modern Tiki around 9 PM for a very quick bite.  I sat outside on a beautful spring evening and enjoyed Seared Ahi on Wonton Crisps(On Starter section of Menu) and a delicious slice of Key Lime Pie.  I did not like the Beverage that I ordered but would come again for dining."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always drive by and finally decided to check this place out for lunch. It's very open and has super cute decor. It was so difficult choosing a cocktail, they all sound delicious! We had the coconut shrimp rolls to start. They were amazing! He got the tacos, which were okay but definitely overpriced. I got the enormous Thai chicken avocado bowl. It was really good, but we could have split it. We left with food babies in our tummies. Next time, we will come on Wednesday for happy hour!"}
{"text":"There's plenty of potential here, and the $2 mimosas on the weekends are pretty awesome.

But we waited around 45 minutes for our food. My dish arrived tepid. The Hangover Hash was disappointing, but my wife's Island Eggs Benedict was terrific, with rich and smoky ham. I eat a lot of ham, and Hula's ham made me take a step back. Maybe the late service should be chalked up to a rush or an anomaly, but our server didn't seem particularly aware of how long it was taking, and also didn't seem interested in checking in on us.

ADDENDUM: Hula's owner reached out to apologize for our lack of service that day, assuring me they were still working out a few logistical issues. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I'm aware how those things often spiral out of control of the staff. I've waited far longer at places, and part of this review stemmed from the fact our 16 month old daughter was with us, tired and cranky.

The truth is, we loved the ambiance and prices. If the food had come quicker, we would've been pleased with the service (we could've had more check-ins, however). I should've emphasized the potential...when the logistics are ironed out, this will be one of the best brunches in Phoenix. As-is, it's really good. (If you don't have a toddler who hasn't napped, that is.)"}
{"text":"Totally unexpected we were seeking out a dog friendly place with an outside patio we ended up eating inside and kept the dogs on the patio because of the heat. They made sure dogs were in the shade and even gave them ice water. Kyle was our server and suggested the chicken bowl that I didn't want to end. My wife had the grilled fish tacos and cleaned her plate! 
We will defiantly come back and the server Kyle is amazing! 

Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very hip looking decor. Quick service! The food arrived really fast and was very tasty. Our server was lovely as well. Our first dinner at Phoenix and we were blown away."}
{"text":"We're big fans of the Tiki thing, so when I was browsing around Yelp and found Hula's, we HAD to try it!  We went out for our 8th Anniversary, and we were not disappointed!

We sat out on the patio in the cooling autumn air -- not cold enough for the fire pit to be lit, but we sat near it, anyway. We were delighted to see that the patio is dog-friendly. We decided right then we'd come back with the dog!

It's not as \"kitschy\" as I expected, but there were Tiki glasses along one wall and Tiki sculptures, so I was happy.  It's a very pleasant atmosphere, both inside and out.  Very open, and this is the perfect time of the year for going. 

We ordered drinks and an appetizer while we examined the menu. I had a Hawaii 5-0, while my wife had a Painkiller. Both were very tasty (and strong!). Well mixed.  Our appetizer was the Abalone-style calamari -- and WOW, was that delicious! I don't know what all was in the sauce, but it was just fantastic, with the pineapple salsa. I could have eaten twice as much.

For dinner I had one of the Hawaiian specials, the Loco Moco -- a sirloin burger on rice with mushroom gravy and fried eggs on top -- not for everyone, I'm sure, but I loved it. I had a side of macaroni salad (not as good as some Hawaiian-style mac salads I've had, but still good).  My wife had shrimp tacos with fried plantains, and determined them quite good.  The portions were very healthy and there was enough to take home for lunch the next day.

We're definitely fans, and we will be back! Thanks for a great anniversary evening!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here before a concert and ordered a drink to share, I believe it was called the scorpion bowl it was amazing! Our burger was very good but the best part was their coconut cream pie  great place to check out!"}
{"text":"This is only the 3rd time I have eaten at Hula's and this time around it was better than the other two times.  I had the chicken tacos which were really good!  I love the decor of the place and cant wait to go and sit on the patio when the weather get a little warmer."}
{"text":"We got the fish cooked with coconut coated and the macadamia coated Hupi  fish both were excellent!! 
The fried banana were all good, very casual dinner area, server was very good. Filling our water glass as soon as it was empty as it is always hot here in the summer. I am just here to move my daughter for school but will want to return the next time I am back in town"}
{"text":"Ahi poke' was amazing ! We had to order an extra. Drinks were cool and refreshing. Spicy Thai chicken bowl and butterfish were also very tasty. 
Our waitress was super cool and attentive. 
Def gonna go back."}
{"text":"We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful, sunny, Tuesday afternoon. I ordered a \"something pink bikini tini\" and it was pretty darn tasty. We ordered the sweet potato fries which were good. The sauce they served with the fries definitely stole the spot light though! It was slightly sweet & creamy. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Rolls & salad off their lunch menu. They were delicious, but I wish they were a little heavier on the coconut. From the looks of their happy hour menu, it looks like a great deal. I will definitely be back to try out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"A very nice bar that's right off the light rail on Central Ave in Downtown Phoenix...great drink menu and huge outdoor seating.  Haven't tried any of the food, but a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"I mean, if I was trapped on an island I could eat here every day. I wrote a review to highlight that this will be you chance to experience the best coconut cream pie your tongue has encountered"}
{"text":"Server wrote in an extra $13 tip for himself on a $51 bill that we had already tipped 25% on!  Did not notice till we got the credit card statement.  Challenging with the card company, but very disappointed.  
Make sure to check your credit card statements after a meal here!"}
{"text":"I went in there expecting not to like it but ended up loving it the food was exceptional I had the veggie burger and it was one of the best I've had in town the painkiller drink it was delicious quite sugary but they really are so there's was good and the Decor was pleasant was very friendly and helpful I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Outside of Hawaii, they make the best Mai Tai's ever. We had 4 each and after that I don't remember much at all."}
{"text":"I previously went to the Scottsdale location and happened to be closer to home when we chose to visit Hula's on Central, and I honestly prefer it.
The decor is a bit more retro than the Scottsdale location, but the layout is just as open and the food just as delicious.  It wasn't nearly as crowded and the wait staff was much more engaged.
I had to order the french toast again and another double mimosa for brunch.  I was NOT disappointed.  The toast wasn't a piping hot or crispy as I would have liked but I still managed to slaughter it.
My friends also both enjoyed their meals of some sort of omelet and the eggs benedict.  I don't have much to say about it other than that as I was too busy stuffing compote down my gullet."}
{"text":"I love this place. They will substitute grilled tofu for any fish plate and unlike most places they do a great job of it. When I was disappointed at the menu at Los Dos Molinos, I left the group there and went here by myself to make sure I got a good dinner. It is my fav place to eat so far in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tasty food! Good vibes. I had the pulled pork plate which was delicious! There's a huge menu so it's easy to find something."}
{"text":"Food was good, more or less timely.  It's right in gay central Phoenix, so if you don't like those of alternate sexual tastes its probably not up your alley, but all in all not too bad. Kind of close seating quarters inside, so definitely if you aren't into gay dudes, sit outside."}
{"text":"Delicious.. service is always friendly and awesome. I get there blackened ahi tuna with sweet potato fries.. amazingnesss and a must try"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. Food and drinks are good here and even more so during happy hour. My favorite is the lilikoi magarita cuz I'm a sucker for passion fruit beverages. The scorpion or volcano (large fruity rum drinks in huge bowls with a float of flaming 151 on top) is always fun to have among friends. It comes with colorful huge straws that you can use hit each other with afterwards, too. :)

It's also conveniently located off the light rail and the patio outside is nice and lively. We always start here when we do our light rail bar crawls and work our way slowly downtown. It's a great place to start out the night."}
{"text":"Wow, I went in wanting to not like this place and I REALLY liked it.

Unique drinks including a pineapple wine. Which has a pineapple nose and a pino gris finish. A few veggie options and the BEST edamame in town!

The edamame are not usual the are tossed with a chili and green onion spicy glaze that I loved! 

The paio is great too large open and not too loud.

The tofu rice bowl at $11 was good too with a nut curry sauce veggies and long strips of tofu.

I saw a Punch bowl with fire on another table, so I assure you I will be back to try this."}
{"text":"Have not tried their food yet, but had a drink with some friends and I absolutely adore the atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from NY and had a bunch of kids in tow.  Hula's was great.  The food was really good- I had the mahi mahi with coconut- it was YUMMY.  I also had the pineapple wine- nice change of pace.  

They were super accomodating with all the kids, and sitting outside was really nice ambiance.  Overall- loved it!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here to eat, but what I remember, the food is awesome. Tropical style with fresh flavors like mango and coconut. Plenty of fresh fish. The decor is modern tiki like the name says. The patio is great especially when weather permits. Their happy hour specials are great and the uniqueness of the drinks is a fantastic plus. It's always nice to sit down at a bar and strike up conversation with the guy 2 seats away as well as the bartender. The staff were definitely friendly. I wish there was one of these closer to the East side."}
{"text":"I came here the other night as part of a college alumni event.  I have to say that I enjoyed the appetizers especially the sweet potato fries.  They have a fine selection of drinks.  However, I could not figure out what the deal was regarding the televisions.  One large screen television had the University of Arizona game, the other had Gilligan's Island.  On second thought, I think I figured out why Gilligan's Island was on.  After I saw the drink prices and how outrageous they are I immediate thought of Thurston Howell and the fact that the prices seemed to be cheap for him and expensive for anyone else.

The atmosphere is standard downtown yuppie with mediocre music.

The indoor/outdoor blended atmosphere is unique and useful this time of year, but I am not sure how it would fare in July.

So..so..!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hula we do take out, post mates and dine it. The last 3 times we have picked up take out the order has been screwed up, the only thing my husband eats is the ahi sandwich plain add avocado and it has not been plain and we have not had avocado although we paid for it. The ticket is correct but the food is not. This time I'm more frustrated because the order was incorrect, they did remake it, but I felt terrible for there host/take out. She is one person answering the phone seating  people and taking care of there waters. After 20 min which is ok if I am eating in they bring me the sandwhich back and it's plain with avocado but the side is not there.  I don't know how management or the owners can prevent these problems but once in a while I would like to have my order correct."}
{"text":"The pineapple mimosas are pretty darn amazing! My issue was with the food. I got the breakfast sandwich which was pretty pricey for just the sandwich and no side. There was WAY too much egg and the bacon seemed low quality. When I arrived for brunch there was no hostess to be found, yet the sign said wait to be seated. I waited around for a few minutes then had a seat at the bar. The service was friendly but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great patio!!
We didn't eat, just day drinking.
Waiter was great!"}
{"text":"First time visiting yesterday and it was fabulous!  Birthday brunch on the patio - pineapple mimosa (they also offer OJ or cranberry versions during weekend brunch) & a painkiller (rum, coconut, pineapple & oj) were a great start.  He ordered the Loco Moco - raved it was the best he's had away from the Big Island.  Visually, it was the most appetizing I've seen served in the last couple of years.  I went with some smaller plates as there was so much I wanted to sample.  We had the Hawaiian ceviche (\"fresh white fish, \"cooked\" in citrus juice, coconut milk, chili, cilantro, garlic, wonton chips\") to start and it was delicious.   I ordered a side of spam and crispy coconut rolls - both were great.  There were lots more items we want to try so we will be back.  Service was great, hostess sat us right away (sunny patio, great for hanging out), and food came up quickly.  We made it a point to talk to the MOD to let them know we are now two huge fans."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars b/c I think there's room for improvement, and there's no doubt that the owner, Dana who came by our table and earnestly asked for unabashed feedback will take our gentle critiques to heart. Our waitress was also very kind and attentive.

We ordered the ahi tuna wonton appetizer.  It was difficult to eat, and sort of flavorless.  I hate adding salt to things, but everyone at the table agreed that a little bit of salt really brought out the flavors.  

The ginger brew soda, should probably be called the honey brew soda with a twist of ginger made with Winnie the Pooh in mind. I didn't try the cocktails, but another friend who was dining at a nearby table said that the cocktails were the only thing she liked about the menu.  She ordered the pork, and from what I hear that's not hitting any home runs.

I ordered the halibut, that was accompanied with a scoop of hearty, plump rice and a slaw salad that added the perfect texture and flavor to the entree.  I really enjoyed my dish.  I'm no foodie, I just like a yummy meal, so it satisfied my simple requirements.  With that said, it could have been on the lighter side.  The Halibut has a cream based sauce, and the slaw was quite creamy as well.  If they subtract a little cream out of one of those items, I think that would strike a better balance.

The sliced steak with wasabi mashed potatoes came in 2nd place.  The texture of the meat was perfect, and the presentation was very nice.  However the flavor of the steak did not wow me.  With that said, the wasabi mashed potatoes were pretty kick-ass.

The chicken something or other with plantains and the same rice that came with the fish, was really meh.  It was overly sweetened, and the meat was dry.  

I should mention that they have tofu tacos for the veggies of the world.

The building has great bones... they don't make em' like that anymore.  There are interior design choices that aren't my fav (generic upholstery, too much tiki kitsch memorabilia), but all and all they've done a great job.  The patio definitely needs some trees in some large planters, or some way to creatively incorporate more greenery (see Parlor).  It has too much of a concrete jungle feel to it out there... not very welcoming.  The bathrooms sort of felt like the old Bahama Breeze place, but I'm probably being too harsh. 

I think this place is gonna get better and better, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ADD A CHOCOLATE DESSERT."}
{"text":"We wanted so much for Hula's to be or favorite restaurant because to the atmosphere and the fact that we are from HI. It is disappointing to have bad meals there every time we try something else rather than fish tacos.
The fish tacos are always good and it's our favorite dish every time we are there.

We tried the spicy Thai which is awful, a bowl of rice mixed with peanut sauce, chicken and raw cabbage. We also ordered Jawaiian jerk chicken, this is really a bad dish, it's smashed/pulled chicken with rice. The texture of the chicken is like smashed baby food with the taste of bland and grossness. I couldn't eat it so we ordered blackened mahi mahi with wasabi sauce. The fish is dry and salty.

We left feeling in such disappointement!"}
{"text":"It's really easy to find this place cause of it's unique blue symmetry shapes. When I first walk in I immediately felt really comfortable as I saw the fire pit and lots of umbrellas and table outdoor. They also have a bar area and indoor as well. After tried 4 appetizers that they had, I concur this place is one of the coziest place in Phoenix that serves a superb meals :) I loved their pork tacos and would be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hula's on three occassions for brunch, and I have to say they have never fail to impress me.  The drinks are delish (especially the one in the tiki-head cup.  Only wish I could remember the name!), and the eggs benedict was my favorite.

The last time I went, a friend and I sat for two hours catching up.  After we finished our breakfast and two drinks, our waitress kept our water glasses full and continued to check-in on us.  I appreciated that.  I didn't feel rushed despite the fact that I wasn't eating/drinking anything any longer.

Will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Usually I rate a 5!  Don't come when it's busy as you won't get the same quality.  Today food was greasy, bad service and the wrong orders! Usually it is very good but come at odd hours.  For busy times, go to the downtown Scottsdale location as they handle volume better.  When staffs under pressure it's not a good outcome from the kitchen to the wait staff.  Wish I had gone to Scottsdale. I think they may have been under staffed. My only one star for them - too busy of a day I guess though there were empty seats ... ? Keith the bartender worked all day and had to serve starting at dinner - management? Where are you?   . What happened?  Scottsdale we go..."}
{"text":"I would like to give Hula the bar (and place for burgers) 5 stars, but Hula the brunch spot, 3.

I have always been served a strong snd affordable drink here, and the bloody mary was no exception, but it was a little watery and could have used a celery stalk. Though for only $5, I shouldn't complain. I got a little buzz, and that's admirable in a bloody mary.

I ordered the special omelet, which this weekend featured shrimp and a grilled mix of peppers and onions.

The good: the portions were healthy and the eggs had a good \"fried in butter\" flavor. The shrimp were perfect, not at all  dry or bland.

The hasbrowns, however, were pretty oily and otherwise unremarkable. Next time I would probably sub for Hawaiian toast and fruit.

The omelet had a sweet sauce. The server said it was mango, I believe. Regardless, it was distracting and didn't add to the eggs well at all. 

Otherwise, the crowd was lively and personable, if a little over-tanned and \"out to be seen.\" just like the other places on this block, it is loud, so don't come for romance or a lounge scene. And unlike most spots that could be described as \"trendy\" the staff here is approachable and laid-back.

I was stoked for another breakfast spot in the hood, but would probably return to Maizie's next time.

Luckily, there's always after dark. The nighttime scene here is great, and I definitely think they do a better burger than their neighbor."}
{"text":"Little know Debbie fact, back when I was about 21 , I had a strong hankering for  the hula . I took  hula classes, twirled  poi pots  about my head and shook my  coconuts believing it would  make me feel tropical and mysterious.

Now, the closest I get to feeling tropical is a night at Hula's. Which is about as much effort as I want to put into it  mysterious anymore.  Hula's Modern Tiki  screams  a fusion of tropical funky with delicious delights . When I walk in the door i am ready to be pulled away from the outside world and imagine myself sitting in a beach town bar.   For me the kitschy , campy Polynesian style makes me me feel giddy.  I love vintage, camp and the Hula's pulls it off. I have  had some amazing good times drinking a silly  drink called Mr. Funk --a combo of coconut rum, banana liqueur and who knows what  served in a tiki glass, sitting with my darling bestie Tom S.  , gossiping , dishing and figuring out the walk of life. We both love  the Poke   , a dish of raw tuna , avocado with a sauce de soy.  The coconut spring roll makes me happy as well. It's light , sweet and stuffed with shrimp and coconut. I can highly recommend  their food.  Think fish , think tropical flair , think delicious.

Just about every time  I am at Hula's I have enjoyed myself and loved my experience. I am sure hanging out with Tom has a lot to do with it but  it helps to go to a fun place too.  i have a personal conviction you can' t drink out of a glass shaped like a tiki god and not have fun.

The staff (except for one  underwhelmed waitress who seemed quite irritated when we asked for drinks at the bar, what was THAT about)  have made me feel welcomed and comfortable. They tend to act like they enjoy what they do and they are hanging out with you too. I look forward to more good times at Hula's Modern Tiki  ...."}
{"text":"Hula's Modern Tiki restaurant is one of those hip destination spots in Central Phoenix, easily accessible and plenty of parking. The buzz just hits you when you enter Hula's, lots of drinking and laughing.

I met up with some other folks for dinner one night. I had the Duke's Luau Pork Plate for $14. It was nothing special and rather disappointing. The others in my party had fish. I tried someone's fish and didn't care for it. So the food for me was just no 'Ono.

This place is probably meant to be more of a drinking place. I would skip the food next time I'm here and just drink heavily."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love a good tiki bar.

Hulas does classic tiki drinks well and has a good happy hour! -8 dollar cocktails are only 6!- and they have a bunch of food items for a good deal too.

My favourite drink here is the pink bikini martini. It's super sweet, almost candy like but I love it. If you like a zombie? They do a really nice one. If you want to have a crazy night, order the scorpion bowl to share! It comes with a little fire in the middle and tastes great, but you'll definitely be feeling it after one of those!

I like to order the potstickers and wings on happy hour. It's a good deal and the wings have a bit of heat and sweetness to them, and they are of course smothered in sauce. The potstickers are just delicious, I can't even say why, the combination of meat and fried dough and those bomb dipping sauces...damn!

I've had the burger here too and it's good. I don't think it's on happy hour though.

They have specials almost everyday of the week, check the Facebook page before you go."}
{"text":"I love Hawaii and I love rum and Tiki's and like Polynesian sauce from Chick Fil-A and I like Pineapples and cool looking glasses and happy hours.  I love Hulas because it has all these things.  What really makes this place is the drinks, I haven't had such good tropical drinks since i visited Hawaii, seriously they hold up and hold up well plus they come in awesome glasses that you can purchase or if your a real douche steal ( I don't condone that).  The only reason Hulas doesnt get 5 stars from me is the food, its been hit and miss for me.  Not bad but not AMAZING, and when you build a place like this with such fantastic drinks and an excellent ambiance you would only expect the food to follow suit.  That being said I will go again and try something new again and hopefully I'll find that dish that blows me away but for the mean time I'll enjoy drinking like I'm on a tropical island in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere, phenomenal food and wizardly crafted drinks make Hula's a guaranteed good time for anyone who enjoys the best parts of life! B-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Fun place and the food rocks. Here celebrating a good friend's birthday. All the food was over the top. If you're visiting Phoenix,  you must eat here."}
{"text":"Came here for Wednesday happy hour thats all day and had a pleasant time. I went right after work and it was kind of packed but nothing I couldn't handle. My face drink was the hurricane it was pretty strong. Also had the coconut shrimp rolls and they were sooo delish! Nice and crunch with some sort of sweet mango sauce as dippi.g sauce.. left me wanting more! Can't wait to come back here for the food."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've (myself and my fiancé, Stacy F., a fellow Yelper) been a total of three times so far, twice to the Scottsdale location and once to the downtown Phoenix location. The food is always hot and fresh, the wait staff and bar tenders friendly and helpful, and there's a fun open air layout. 

The pork tacos are phenomenal, although I'm not crazy about the black beans and rice on the side.  We moved out here from Florida last May, and out that way we're far more used to yellow rice with our black or red beans, so it's merely a matter of personal preference.  The food is prepared exceptionally well.  Tonight I tried the spicy Asian wings with a side of regular fries, which were even better than I expected. When it comes to drinks, the Dr. Funk is our favorite so far, but there are plenty more we have yet to try. 

Overall this is one of our new favorite restaurants in the greater phoenix area, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  I personally prefer the new Scottsdale location, but you can't go wrong with either!"}
{"text":"On a mission to find all the pet friendly restaurants in town...and hope we like their food. Hula's Modern Tiki makes the list.
Great patio, nice ambient lighting, moderate traffic passing by, relaxed feel. I really like the \"in the city\" feel the restaurant has w/ Central traffic passing by.
Started with the Samurai Beef Sticks: Excellent. tasty w/o being too much, juicy and the pineapple was good too. Main:Duke's Luau Pork plate, great. I would get it again. The date had a ribeye, he says it was just alright. His side of macaroni was so so delicious!!!! It is one of those dishes I crave.
We know we like a place when we both say we would go back, especially for the mac & cheese! Giving it a 4 star until we can go back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"Normally, I love this place. Today shit service and the manager didn't even care. My meal was completely consumed before my drink arrived. I saw my drinks sittin on the counter, don't blame the bar staff. And don't blame \"everyone can't all at once-we got slammed\". That's why you have a wait list!
If the manager would have had a different attitude I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"After a long day and a longer week, I agreed to fetch the BFF from the airport in exchange for dinner.  We initially decided on Maizie's, but when the entire lot at the Landmark was full, we circled around to the adjacent complex and decided to try Hula's instead.  The patio was full, but we were immediately seated inside.  Our waitress Victoria was quite charming and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu while we chatted.  After a few minutes, he decided on a beer and I asked for a passion fruit iced tea and the Zombie - a delightful combination of rum and fruit juices.

After we ordered, we sat back and enjoyed the ambiance.  The indoor seating area was empty, but a group of four was seated beside us.  I wasn't sure about the close seating with connected tabletops, but it really wasn't so bad, even when a group of four was seated right beside us.  I excused myself to use the restroom and was happy to see it was clean and non-smelly.

A short while later, our meals arrived.  We both ordered burgers - his was beef and had mushrooms and mine was Ahi, and of course, we both ordered the sweet potato fries.  Unfortunately, they were undercooked!  We let our waitress know, and she took our plated after apologizing.  She returned minutes later with our burgers and a promise of a fresh basket of fries for us to share.  The fresh batch of fries was much better - hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I think Mazie's are better, but these were definitely good.  Our burgers were each served on really nice, thick buns with sesame seeds.  I can't speak for my friend's meal, but my burger was wonderful!  I asked for no slaw and the sun-dried tomato pesto aioli on the side.  The aioli had a really nice flavor and tasted great on the burger.  The ground tuna seemed to have been combined with diced serranos which gave it a really, really nice flavor and a bit of heat.

Despite being stuffed, we each finished our meals and sat talking for a long while after.  Our waitress was super-attentive and kept the iced tea and water refills coming steadily.  Nice surprise: after the bill was paid, she brought us an order of shrimp rolls.  She said it was an incorrect order but wanted us to have them since we were so great.  I'm not a fan of shrimp, but the rolls looked and smelled delicious.  I tried some (sans shrimp) and loved the flavor of the toasted coconut flakes and the really great pineapple dipping sauce.

I am very much looking forward to returning to Hula's again and again.  Lunch service will begin on November 1, which seems too far away.  Great service, great food, great ambiance - love it!"}
{"text":"Very nice place we went in the middle of the afternoon and went to have some drinks and we also split a ceaser salad. Very very good I will definitely be going back here. The drinks where amazing flavor was very good not to strong they also came in cool fun cups . I had one that came in a coconut . My partner had a drink that had a big ol tiki face on it. We ended with some mimosas very very relaxed place."}
{"text":"Look at my pic of the mango ahi caesar salad.
DELICIOUS!
Best caesar salad ever.

The large bartender in the Hawaiian shirt was awesome, attentive, and super friendly.

I shall return many times.  I'm anxious to try brunch and dinner here.  Yay Hula's!"}
{"text":"Really fun place, great service, lousy food! It's probably a great place to go and have drinks and hang out, but seriously..... the food sucked.... No thanks.... after being in Hawaii this past year, this was a not very authentic. Whatever....  Have fun with the drinks."}
{"text":"With the unfortunate number of terrible experiences I've been having that have led to recent 1 and 2 star reviews, I'm glad Hula's provided a decent experience.  I've been here twice and had a crappy experience (the 4th day they were open, so I was willing to forgive) and a pretty good experience a week and a half later.  I've had just about everything they offer, so to sum up:

- Cool atmosphere, as noted by everyone else.  Open late, serves food late, and is relatively cheap

- There is nothing authentically Hawaiian about anything they serve here.  It's as authentic Hawaiian as Fez is authentic Middle Eastern.  That's not a bad thing, lord knows I love Fez and have enjoyed Hula's, it's just a fact you need to know in order to have a proper expectation of the food.  You're not going to get a fine Hawaiian culinary experience here.  I like Roy's for that ;-)

- The food in general is good-not-great.  
   - Favorite dishes - shrimp roll and poke apps, macadamia crusted mahi and teriyaki ono (or is it teriyaki hapu?).  
   - Decent dishes - The ceviche is ok, it's a fish ceviche which I'm normally not crazy about.  The pulled pork dishes are underwhelming but ok.  The sweet potato fries were mushy on the first visit (bleck) but nice and crispy the second, so it's going in the \"decent\" category
   - Least favorite dishes - the steak was a 9oz piece of gristle, bleck!  The fried plantains were also pretty gross, I was really hoping for plantain chips but these were just mushy burnt blobs of plantain.

- The specialty drinks are all VERY SWEET...but VERY STRONG.  I forget the names of the ones I preferred.  We also had a volcano bowl which is, as previously noted, very sweet and strong.  The best drink they offer isn't even on the menu though - they stock Absolut Boston which is a black tea infused vodka.  My friends and I always order it with lemonade and have a delicious, strong Arnold Palmer.

- The service is hit and miss.  The food generally comes out of the kitchen very quickly.  But some of the servers are flakes.  Feh, not a big deal.

All in all, I'm glad to have this new edition to the CenPho light rail area.  Adds another good option to my regular haunts of Fez, Maizies, Postino, and Cheuvront."}
{"text":"A Gluten Free review.

The waitress didn't have a good idea what was gluten free and after saying \"oh, its not breaded, its covered in Panko so its ok\" I was hesitant to trust anything she suggested (panko is wheat...in case you were wondering). Then she said something had modified food starch and I was confused as to what kind of \"food starch\" it was...corn starch? wheat starch? what? so, that was out. So, I was just left with a menu with a bunch of sauces that if I kept asking questions would have sent her back to the kitchen 10 times with questions for busy cooks and half answers when she returned. 

I settled on the burger with no bun, which, unfortunately I often have to settle for with this annoying allergy. At least it was one of the best burgers I've had in a really long time.  Still, I didn't go to Hula's for a burger...I wanted something different...something Hawaiian (and the burger doesn't have anything Hawaiian about it, except Maui onions.) 

The burger is ground in-house and the fries are hand cut in house...delicious, but again...a burger and fries.  I really wish they had some more options or some clarity as to what ingredients are so I could have tried something else. Hula sauce, just so you know, is ketchup & mayo. 

She was nice and attentive and didn't get annoyed by my questions or multiple apologies for being difficult (due to the allergy questions). Our glasses were kept full and we were served promptly."}
{"text":"Hula's is awesome! The appetizers are great and the drinks are even better.

You have to try the Scorpion bowl! It's delicious and big enough to share! It's literally on fire. Like wow, this drink is LIT.

I was skeptical of Hula's at first because I'm not usually one for themed bars and restaurants, however, I was impressed. Thanks, Hula's!"}
{"text":"I love this place as a bar.  The tiki decor is fun and I love that the whole building opens up.  Super fun space and the bar staff are great.  It satisfies me when I need a super fruity fru-fru drink."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that you can dive into the joint from the sidewalk, I am not sure how you can consider this Tiki Bar a dive. Lets put our grass-skirt on and do a review on Hulas:

~Fud/Drink~
Off the top, I have to say that Hulas is EXACTLY how I imagined it went I was day-dreaming about cocktails in the middle of my 4x10 shift. The cocktails they offer are simply bliss. Have a couple of them and your rum-soaked mind will transport you to a beach filled with......er....more booze? Wherever Jimmy Buffet goes to after he get schnockered, just imagine that...Wherever it be, we are talking about a tropical paradise.  

I tried a Zombie, which is a concoction of numerous tropical fruit juices along with rum...You just have to try it, its the house specialty. I was the DD, so I could only try this one drink before sobering up... next time, I will break necks to be able to have a couple. I did indulge in the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...which were equally amazing. I can't describe in words how filling this appetizer was. Needless to say, I was in heaven chowing down on the fish cakes, along with my Zombie...a sentence never spoken until now, btw. 

~Atmosphere/Service~
I went on Halloween night this year. I was expecting ghouls and spookiness. I got a tiki band with a bass playing upbeat beach songs, all dressed as zombies. It was 100 times more fun than spooky music, and set the scene. All waiters were dressed in fun costumes, and proved to be helpful when I asked questions. When we sat down, a waiter came up and helped us order while I waited for a friend to show. I do have to say that he was a tad bit awkward, kinda hovered a tad every now and then, but I'll give him a pass...at least he cared and kept coming back, rather than never again. While relaxing and eating/drinking, I checked out the space, I love how wide open they made the venue, with easy entry to the outside. As to where you can sit, you have a large wrap around bar top to sit at, as well as outside seating, perfect for cooler temps. As you can tell, the place is all set up as a tiki feel, you almost would come to expect a sand-volleyball court would be set up nearby. Fun times, nonetheless.

~Extras/Rating~
I have nothing but good things to say about this location. They offer a ton of fish items, so next time I am over, I think I will splurge and give some things a try. Add them on Facebook ASAP, because they offer numerous deals each week. Check out their website which also has info on their daily specials. Combining the specials with normal prices, you can really have an awesome time at a lower price, which is why I really love this place. I can't wait to go back, it only took one night, one dish, and one drink to hook me on...so I am sure they'll get you hooked too! Stop on in! 5 stars goes to Hulas for location/atmosphere, cocktail varieties, food selection, daily specials, and strong management/customer service. You can tell they are doing it right. Thank you Hulas!"}
{"text":"My friends Steve and Liz live on the light rail route and introduced us to Hula's earlier this year and my hubby and I are hooked!  

Get there before 6pm Mon - Friday and enjoy their nummy happy hour specials.  I order 2 pork or tofu tacos for $3.00 each and I am stuffed!

We were there again this past Saturday and I tried their Johnny Cakes for the very first time, which is a Jamaican corn bread and it's the best corn bread I have ever eaten.

I am suppose to be on a diet, but when someone mentions Hula's I make sure to make exceptions for this place, even if it's the only meal I eat all day.

Also, all the waiters, waitresses, and I think the owner Dana are always so friendly and welcoming that it makes you just want to stay there longer than intended."}
{"text":"Building was great, beautiful architecture and nice & casual ambiance. Servers were pleasant and attentive and the place was busy which signals to me that it must be good. However, got the menus and they were dirty and seemed to be wiped with a not-so-fresh rag cause they stinked.
Ordered the steak sandwich and it was super salty. I don't remember ever complaining about a restaurant's food being too salty, so it even suprised me. Even my friend who loves salty food thought her lobster bisque was too salty. To top it off, I ordered my steak medium rare, but received it rare so I couldn't even finish it cause it was so hard to chew. Hopefully it was just an off day, but don't really see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Cliff notes version - Food - ok, Service - Ok-ish, Drinks - watered down and mostly crap. Also why I try avoid the place if I can even though they are less than a mile out. 

Now lets be fair, im not fond of the cuisine so I will say they have some vegetarian options, and they are good, again nothing great, but then thats not their main business. I would think its sea food and from my friends who have had food here it is pretty good. 

Service - what service ? It can range form OK to abysmal depending on the mood of the person and that is reason enough to not bother. 

Drinks - Absolute waste. I dont see why anyone would come here for their drinks . 

2 stars and I'm being kind."}
{"text":"Such a neat place with a neat concept and neat atmosphere. Love the specialty drinks they make very tropical. Fun place to come for happy hour and they have great 2-for-1 specials. If you're ever in Midtown Phoenix I recommend a visit here especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Found ourselves driving aimlessly around Phoenix on Christmas Eve (seriously, nothing was open and no one was around) and just before we were about to throw in the towel (it was 4pm!) we found this place. 

Happy Hour is only a rumor in Chicago so we were excited to happen upon Hula's HH during this time. Some apps and specialty drinks are priced at $5 and they both get the job done.  Not mind-blowing awesome, but pretty good.  With the $5 off when you check-in on yelp, we ended up with a bill of $10.  Nice and easy.

It's unusual for us midwesterners to dine outside on Christmas Eve, but the welcoming outdoor patio with a huge firepit in the middle helped me forget about a White Christmas. I'll take al fresco dining, please.  Service was attentive and friendly to us out-of-towners.

Whenever I'm in town, which will be more often now as my family has moved here, I'll make sure to try to include a visit here to my itinerary."}
{"text":"Love a tiki theme!  When is a punchbowl full of booze ever a bad idea?  Even without alcohol, Hula's serves a great lunch.  I had the ahi tuna salad, which came as a very large platter with rice, cabbage, avocado and tangy wasabi cream dressing.  More food than I could finish, even though I wanted to!  

If you time your visit correctly, you'll get to see Arizona's most privileged Catholic school girls from across the street.  Seriously though, it can cause annoying traffic when school gets out."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and the cocktails are awesome. You must try the Tropical itch. The staff is very helpful and laid back. I have tried the new Scottsdale location but I prefer this one. They are also dog friendly on the outside patio. I love how they even have a happy hour on the weekends."}
{"text":"I went with 2 buddies to catch up and grab a bite.  Patio was awesome to hang out on to people watch and get fresh air.  We ordered the fish bites, like popcorn white fish, which were pretty good.  I also ordered a burger, rare, with the works and sweet potato fries.  It was pretty delicious, as well as filling.  Tasty and memorable experience.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great looking location.  Good atmosphere, bar is a nice size, outdoor and indoor seating areas.  Get there early as they get packed in a hurry.

Service was excellent.  Nice mix of cocktails.  Food selection (there were six of us and no complaints) is pretty diverse and quality is excellent.  Prices I thought were very reasonable.

Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"So since my very first experience here a while back I am going to update my opinion. It still does not get the coveted 5 star award but it gets a 3.5 now.. not so much a 4 just yet. But it is growing on me. I enjoy their happy hour and I have now tried most all of their signature cocktails. I must say, i am quite happy with what they have to offer. Also, it is pretty interesting and curious that they carry every single Absolut flavor. there are so many more than I knew even existed to be perfectly honest. But then again, a lot of their drinks are fruity so you need the different flavors to diversify your cocktail list. i get it.

As for the food, I tried the shrimp things again and this time they were delicious. I have also since tried their tacos, ceviche and a few others that are not necessarily note worthy but still tasty none the less. I do appreciate the company I keep every time I come here, whether it be friend, colleague or date. The bartenders are also decent conversationalists so thanks to you above average intelligent bartenders. Kudos to you! :)

I will keep coming here on and off so you have nothing to worry about... you most likely made me a lifer!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, and it is all day on Wednesday! They have the traditional tiki bar drinks, plus many delicious options. I am a fan of their HH appetizers and their full menu. Hawaiian is so hit or miss in the Valley and this totally hits the spot. One thing that was a surprise was the spicy sauce on the curry shrimp! Be forewarned, and maybe you will enjoy the surprising heat this place can bring!"}
{"text":"My last review was 4 stars, I had to up it to 5 for the simple fact that they donated 10% of their proceeds to Phx Animal Cruelty. This almost made me cry, and I'm not the type to cry. 
I loved Hula's before for their great atmosphere, food, and cocktails, but this just blew it all out of the water for me. I wish more businesses did such a selfless act."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here! There is something for everyone! The menu and atmosphere is very eclectic. You'll find business groups, old people, young people and some people that you can't quite figure out. One thing is for certain- you'll always get good service! I've been here for brunch, lunch, happy hour and dinner and have never once been disappointed. 
As for what to order I highly recommend the spicy thai chicken bowl! If you are on a budget I recommend the pork taco only $3 on the happy hour menu. The amount of meat is easily 2 tacos. My favorite part of the menu... DRINKS! The blood orange martini on the rocks is a must try!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Lucy, Kyle and Paige for kicking butt during our company event held at Hula's.  You guys were so great and patient."}
{"text":"Went to Hula's with some friends recently. Lived in the area for years so we decided to hit this place up. The drinks were pretty good. Even if you dont like a lot of fruity drinks they have a full bar. Appetizers were okay but not particularly noteworthy. But the main dish of Jerk pork tasted great but made me sick later on that night. Almost as bad was the waiter who was polite but aloof which kind of Debbie Downer'd the experience. First and probably last visit. Too bad.  Anyone want my 5$ coupon for free food?"}
{"text":"I like Hula's because their food is pretty consistent. At least in my experience. My favorite is the poke. I crave it! Every time I get something other than the poke I always wish I made a different decision. Love the Mai Tais too. 

The food is good, not great. We normally go for brunch specials or weekly happy hour all day special. Makes it worth it for us. They seem to always have new waitresses who tend to make the experience inconsistent. They forget things, like to get our order or refill our drinks. We go enough that we expect this and it's worth the happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"This place is 3 stars in the best sense.  It's really super cute and 50s tiki-themed.  The inside is really nice but a little cramped, with a beautiful patio, tiki-themed decor, and even tiki mugs.  

There are lots of fun, rummy, sugary drink options, some served in tiki mugs.  The food is pretty good, and pretty reasonably priced - definitely better than average bar food.  It tends to be loud and crowded and the service is a little spotty.  

Mid-summer visits can be iffy.  The misters can't be on outside after the sun goes down...apparently this makes the patio slippery, but, frankly, it also makes the patio really, really hot, especially if the misters are on when you're seated and then turned off a few minutes later.  They also sometimes list items on the menu long after they've actually discontinued them (the ground ahi burger is an example - the server said: oh, we haven't carried that for ages).

Over all, a fun place to meet friends and hang out, if you don't mind waiting a bit for service, bumping into people, and gettting pretty hot on summer nights."}
{"text":"I LOVE Hula's. I also highly recommend only coming to the Phoenix location. Great vibe, the patio is nice and dog friendly. The servers are fantastic, Keith is my favorite, hands down. On our last visit there, Soupy was EXTREMELY nice and made up for the terrible birthday experience I had at their Scottsdale location. Get the blood orange martini on the rocks and the spicy thai chicken bowl, you won't be disappointed. `"}
{"text":"I went to Hula's Modern Tiki about a year ago and I've been feigning to return.  I got that chance again today when a friend and I stopped by for lunch.  I like the laid back atmosphere and the always-friendly staff.  Makes the food taste even better.  We had the coconut shrimp, sweet fried plaintains with salad.  Um, um, good! We both ordered the same thing.  Even the same drink, Painkiller! Awesome.  Try it."}
{"text":"Maybe we got off to a bad start, it happens.     We asked to sit at pub table, but the hostess said it was reserved for another party in an hour and 15 minutes.  It makes more sense to me that if you have a paying customer, ready to sit, aren't you losing money with an empty table?  Anyway, we sat, ordered appetizers and drinks, then two entrees.  I ordered a steak sandwich, everything on the side, it was served with cheese.  No worries, miscommunication, my daughter wanted it plain so we asked for it without cheese. I was polite, but the server/hostess came back later to make a point it comes with cheese.  I chalked it up to miscommunication on both our parts, if it was not clear, she should have asked.  I could have done without the side of attitude.  Otherwise the food, drinks and bartenders were cool.  I have to rate it as a-ok because of the service."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Great place to be. It just feels like living hanging here.  It's almost better than being in Hawaii.  Everyone was very nice. Not just the bartender who  gave us great service but also the host and who ever ran our food out while it was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"1 star for the seating debacle
4 stars for the food
5 stars for a great bartender

You do the math.

We had a party of four, but it might as well have been 12.  Although there were several open tables, we had to wait about 30 minutes for no other reason than they were trying to space out the seating so the servers weren't overwhelmed and you didn't have to wait at your table long.  Huh?  I actually saw the hostess seat a party of two at a four-top next to an empty table for two.  So it's better to have me wait in the entry way (along with scores of other people) and become increasingly irritated, with no drink in hand needless to say.  Finally a group left the bar and we were able to sneak in there.  

Enter the bartender with a halo over his head.  My Hula's Hurricane was delivered swiftly and all was right again.  We opted to share appetizers, poke and coconut shrimp rolls.  Now the poke did not sound appealing to me at all because of the whole raw fish deal, but my friend gave it high marks, and rightfully so.  With the soy and sesame dressing and the avocado, this dish was fantastic.  The coconut shrimp rolls were not to be outdone, though.  Perfect with a pineapple dipping sauce.

Would love to go to Hula's again, but will have a flask with me...and a lawn chair."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely Thursday evening dinner with my bestie a few weeks ago. Lots of yummy cocktails and a good beer selection! I am a vegetarian and there are tofu options or substitutions for almost everything. As mentioned by other Yelpers- the sweet potato fries are amazing. And I've had my fair share of SPF. The service was exceptional and our server was helpful- eager to suggest drink and menu options.  This was not my first visit and it will definitely not be my last."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food, good service, nice looking place with good parking.  

Their Polynesian chicken  sandwich is my favorite item.  

Hula burger is also top notch."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is poor, spoke directly to the server and he flat out ignored me and my friends."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I have not reviewed Hula's before but I guess I wanted to think it was my secret place that everyone already knows about.  

Hula's have always been consistant with both food and Staff.  In the two years that I have been a regular, I see the same friendly staff each time.  John, one of the bartenders, is a big reason why we visit Hula's so often as he is friendly and makes us feel like we are his most important customers.  

The food is always fresh and for me, addictive.  My favorite is the Tuna Poke that consists of raw ahi, soy sauce, sesame oil, avocado, onions, macadamia nuts.  

Hula's has a great TIKI TIME happy hour will save you some money on food and drinks but beware, they do get crowded.  TIKI TIME Happy Hour 3:30p-6p, Mon-Fri & All night on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. The first 2 for cocktails and a small plate and last time (using a Groupon certificate) for Brunch. The seaweed salad was good and I really loved the plantains. For brunch I had the hula hash- pork with an egg on top over hash browns. SO GOOD! I was not fond of the Bloody Mary, but the mimosa was up to par and only $3."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks but kinda wimpy. Sweet potato fries, Mac n cheese, fried plantains. All highly recommended. Great place to sit outdoors n hang w great company."}
{"text":"What a gem for the mainland! I love their specials they have throughout the week. Dana and his crew definitely got everything RIGHT with this place. The decor, food, atmosphere, drinks, and service are all great. I'm a particular fan of the black bean burger; it's not like many of the veggie-based burgers. This is thick, hearty, flavorful, and not heavy. I don't know if your tastebuds would, but mine boogie with glee. I also like the shrimp tacos with their version of slaw. Again, not heavy and just the right blend of acid and sweet. 

Their happy hours are such great deals, and happy hour on the weekends is practically the entire day! Anybody up for some Tiki Time? 

The patio is fantastic for sitting and sunning along the light rail path. You can glimpse the dome of St Francis Xavier or look across toward the interior of the restaurant. Either way, you feel like you are in a happy Phoenix place. 

The best part? A pup friendly patio, and that's always platinum to me! Not only to they allow dogs, they'll bring out a bowl of water and include a cookie or two, too! Two paws up!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner before going out for the night.  The environment here is lively and the service is friendly.

The shrimp tacos were dry and flavorless.  We both tried to swallow it down but it was difficult we couldn't finish.

The south seas fish tacos (hapu fish) were so good.  The fish was moist and flaky, just the way we like it.  We both like trout/grouper so this fish was right in line with the taste.  I'd give the fish 4.5 stars for Arizona.  The red beans and rice were a nice touch.

We will come back and try different items.  Looks of interesting looking things on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here once for brunch/lunch a couple of weeks back. The veggie burger was really good, drinks were amazing (beware: had 3 double mimosas and was out of my mind. Not complaining, this is actually a compliment since some places can have very weak mimosas, just be ready for it). Reason for the missing star is service. It was okay but the guy seemed very bored and apathetic, which can kinda bring you down when you're trying to have a Sunday funday"}
{"text":"I was let down when I arrived for dinner here. My fish patties were over-cooked. When my dinner finally arrived the black beans were cold and the rice was hard and cold, and the chicken that came with my meal was not that great either. When I got home I had to use the bathroom immediately."}
{"text":"Just a great place to hang!

Hula's is my go to place whenever I just want a good time. Great drinks, great food, great service, great ambiance.

Tiki Time (Happy Hour) has a great list of Tiki drinks that are priced just right as well as a very nice selection of foods. The full menu is very extensive providing something different no matter how often you visit.

And the service always rocks. From my second visit the staff has known my drinks and food preferences. It is so nice when you don't have to always ask for the little things that make your visit special.

Nothing like sitting on the patio and sipping a Mai Tai to make the evening go by."}
{"text":"I stopped by Hula's last week for a quick dinner/drinks with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised. Of course it was a bit warm at 5:30 to sit on the cute patio so we opted to sit inside. We did get there during happy hour so we ordered off that menu so we could try different items. 

For starters we each had a cocktail: 
She had the Pink Bikini Martini, it was good but tasted like a jolly rancher for sure. 
I had the Dr. Funk, I really enjoyed this refreshing cocktail and brought me back to being on a beach! Ahh... 

For food we started with the Hawaiian Ceviche, very fresh white fish in citrus juice, coconut milk, chili, cilantro and garlic. The ceviche was refreshing and light. The chucks of fish were very good size and also you had a nice portion for two people to share. 

For dinner she had two of the pork taco's and she really enjoyed them. Both tacos were loaded with a ton of shredded pork and salsa on the side. They looked very yummy. 

For dinner I had the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes. The Shrimp Rolls were very tasty. They had two rolls cut in half and were cooked and flavored perfectly. The Spicy Fish Cakes weren't my favorite. You got 3 cakes on an order and as they were spicy I felt they were missing something. Not sure if I'd get them again but well worth the try. 

All of our items were $3 to $5 so the happy hour prices are well worth going and to try a few things. 

I will for sure go again as some of their fish on their regular menu looked very tasty so I'd like to try other items and take advantage of their cute patio."}
{"text":"My original review that got deleted when I deleted My account.

I am nostalgic, as a kid in the 70's vacations consisted of places that always had a Tiki bar  My summer home in upstate New York was in walking distance to the Tiki resort.  And then there is Hawaii of course ...ah the memories .

I have a serious thing for Tiki bars, every home i ever lived in i built a Tiki bar ( except my new one ) Gimme time !

Whoda thunk that in the valley of the sun i would find one ( big excitement here)

Aloha Au Ia`oe...( i love you ) let me count the ways ....

1.seriously loved the bar - totally unique, and a beach bunny like myself felt right at home.  Fond memories of all my hot surfer boyfriends came to mind 

2.nice patio, nice fire pit ..i dug it !

3.happy hour -WOW i am so Dr.funked up off 3 of those tasty bad boys .

4.nice happy hour menu & the coconut shrimp rolls hit the spot .

5.friendly, funny patrons ...i was told i looked like the little mermaid \"in a GOOD way \"
ha ha ha 
( note to self : never add a gloss to my hair myself again ) 

so to recap,  even if i wasn't totally  dr. FUNKED UP , i would still love this place! nice chill spot, good service .i had a great time ..... i am a total fan !

update: Place still rocks after a year of patronage.
You almost forget you are in a land locked state when you are here."}
{"text":"So, my most recent visit to my newly favorite lunch place was da bomb. Instead of my usual calamari sandwich and sweet potato fries I got the Mongolian beef with lime curry sauce. Now, usually Jamaican's don't fancy lime in their curry. But I had my grandmother turning over in her grave on Thursday because I really enjoyed the taste of the lime curry sauce, beef, beans and rice. I especially liked that the dish had cilantro in it, but not too much. One thing I noticed about Hula's while I was there is the music. It was loud enough for me to hear it but not too loud to hold a conversation. Our server was great. She kept our glasses filled and checked on us regularly but was not a bug-a-boo. I ate inside this time instead of outside and it made me realize how much I prefer eating outside here. I got to meet the owner, Dana, who is a cool down to earth guy. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely great experience here last night. Keith and the rest of the staff were very friendly and the food and atmosphere were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Check this place out for happy hour,  good drinks,  the ambience is  nice, specially if you sit outside.  However don't come expecting great food or outstanding service.  Things taste a bit defrosted, I might be wrong,  but you know how you have frozen taquitos warmed up in the microwave? Yeah,  sort of like that."}
{"text":"we had a coupon to try this place out for brunch. must have been a popular coupon because they were sold out of breakfast items and mimosa's. 

the place is so cool and tiki-ish. i love the old tiki mugs. the brunch-lunch was not overwhelming and yet tasty. i had the fish taco's, she the tofu taco's. i thought mine were pretty good and loved the sweet potato fries (as usual). the rest of their meat and non-meat food looked also delicious and we hope to hit this place up again soon. since we had the coupon, we only paid 2 bucks!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a happy hour and I was highly impressed with their happy hour selections. It's all night happy hour on Wednesdays so right in the beginning they were already impressing me. Their cocktails are 6 bucks on happy hour and these weren't your typical sweet tropical drinks with barely any booze in them. They were pretty big drinks and very delicious too. The food on happy hour was mostly great. Chicken wings were great. Crispy, and I loved the sweet soy glaze that they were tossed in. Sweet potato fries were crunchy and cooked well. Basically what you would want from a sweet potato fry. Just make sure to only get a small order if you don't want an entire huge basket full with the large. Fish bites were surprisingly great. It is just straight up fish battered in panko and fried to a golden brown. All thriller, no filler (shout out to Guy Fieri). The only thing that I was not a fan of was their calamari. This is a very unique take on a calamari and I don't think it worked that great. The textures were kinda off but other then that that meal and the drinks were on point. Last thing I will end on, this restaurant is freakin loud!! Don't come here expecting a quiet evening. If you go on happy hour, just expect some great drinks and bites."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour. We were pleasantly surprised the HH goes all night on Wednesday! Great drinks and a large HH menu with good portion sizes. We had the fish bites, potstickers, calamari, and ceviche. All delicious!. I wish I could remember the drink I had - so good! Gin and ginger beer with some other yummy stuff. Very refreshing and tasty! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"You can all disregard my previous review. I absolutely love this place, and apparently my girlfriends are on board as well. All night happy hour, central Phoenix, easy-on-the-eye bartenders... SOLD. 

I had mentioned my previous experience to them and how I wanted to give the place a second chance. We love the area and all the surrounding places, so, why not? Best decision. We started off with appetizers (beef sticks, edamame, wings) that were anything but traditional. Every dish had a cultural kick to it, which I loved. 

Not surprisingly, we could still go for round two... so, all these plates start coming with jerk chicken, ribs, something called a Kahuna? (steak plate) and all other kinds of jaw-dropping, mouth-watering foods. 

So, at this point, I'm completely stuffed and can't breathe. I love food, but Hula's won this round. However! I kept drinking (damn those sour amarettos) and my girlfriends were drunkenly flirting with the bartender... aaaand that's when you know it's time to go.

As the saying goes:  everything deserves a second chance. See you soon, Hula's!"}
{"text":"Hula's is a cool, not too cheesy, tiki bar in central Phoenix. I like it because it's right off the light rail, only a short ride from my house. Usually sit on the outside patio, which faces Central. Haven't really tried much of the food, calamari was pretty good and been told that their burgers are delish.
The best part of Hula's is their Tiki Time happy hour, weekdays 330-6 and all day on the weekends! I'm not usually a Mai tai fan, but theirs are reeeally good.  They have brunch specials on the weekends, haven't tried that out yet but need to soon...  I'm always on the prowl for a mimosa!!
Overall, I really dig this place. Chill and a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, great tacos, delicious mac, service was awesome! Definitely will be back!!

Only thing was limes were extremely dry... Probably got 1 drop outta each wedge"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this rating.  Two stars is \"Meh, I've experienced better.\", and I have.  Three stars is \"A-OK\", which it  was.  

Had the manager not compensated me for the ridiculously small plate of ribs I got, this review would be scathing.  But he did make it mostly right and that went a long way towards fixing the overall experience to a third star.  But two things about the third star:  I shouldn't have to feel like a cheapass by wondering if I got a full rack or a half rack.  The food didn't feel like anything special, which would have been acceptable if the prices were far lower.   

Two stars it is.  

Our party arrived on a Friday night--we were in the area, a little lost for a good place to go.  I remembered this place as a good hangout spot on a weekday night, which it definitely is.

Tonight, we were seated promptly and never waited very long for anything--the service was fast and top-notch.   However, i'm having difficulty with this whole hipster thing where the wait staff dresses in  street clothes.  It weirds me out and it's almost insulting for as expensive as the place is.  

I totally dig the overall ambience.  The restaurant itself appears to be in a rehabbed auto mechanic's shop, creating something totally unique in a region of unique rehabs.  The comfortable patio hangs right off Central Avenue, creating a rare big-city kinda place in Phoenix.  The fire pit is just cool, they play good and fun music.   Ambience is about the one thing about this place that actually lines up with the price, contributing solidly to Uptown's burgeoning vibe.

The beer selection felt weak.  We didn't order cocktails, so I can't comment on that.  

Going through our courses....The potstickers were good, but the thai peanut sauce just tasted weird.  The spicy edamame was an interesting twist but I didn't find myself very hungry for it   My friend ordered the cajun burger which he thought was \"mediocre.\"  I ordered what turned out to be the smallest full rack of ribs in Arizona described above--the mango to the sauce was too slight leaving it fairly generic, altho the fries and slaw were pretty good.   The meat, yeah I wolfed it down, but in the end it didn't seem like anything to write home about.  

The food and drink, all in all, felt more or less average.  The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food.     Given the other choices in the area that I still need to try out, I don't see much of a reason to come back for dinner again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was craving for some fish tacos and they were amazing! It came with very tasty salsa, I fell in love- my taste buds were so happy.

I know this place is well known for their drinks, I wanted to try but didnt. Although a few people next to me had a volcano bowl that they said was pretty tasty. 

The layout was nice, they had their patio but it was wet from all the rain. Inside was nice- cute decor, very trendy design.

Service was quick and friendly. No long waits and they come to check on you often. Overall, very nice place- definitely will be back with others to try the volcano bowl :)"}
{"text":"Looking for a dtphx spot for lunch? Do not pass this place up! Great break outta the mold! This place has a laid back atmosphere, great prices on happy hour, and some of the most delicious island style grub I've found anywhere. Shoot, I've been to a number of restaurants in Hawaii that can't match Hula's teriyaki chicken sammich! The sweet potato fries too.. mmm. If you're a Phoenix native, a college student, or just passing thru, this shop is a must-eat!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here, it was such a nice experience! It was a girls night out, once we got to the resturant  the table was ready for us and on time ..  Great service and great atmosphere, food was good too. I definitely  recommend  it !!"}
{"text":"This place is in my \"circle of trust\" when it come to good food and good staff. I suggest trying the shrimp rolls and civeche... AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Truth be told, I was holding off on my review of Hula's because I just didn't share everyone's enthusiasm for the place. 

Without a doubt, the space is cool. The concept is original for Phoenix. 

But, I'm not big on super sweet drinks so their signature cocktails were not on my list of \"big deal happy hour bargains\" and the food wasn't anything I craved. Until now. 

They must be new, because they are not included on the menu posted on the website, but there are some rice bowl additions. I had the steak bowl. I'm telling you: the steak was pink and tender, the sauce was spicy and craveable, it was a generous portion size and, over all, that bowl alone will get me to be the first to say, \"Hey! Let's go to Hula's!!\""}
{"text":"Their burgers are great and they have a big speciality drink menu to try , definately a regular spot of mine."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and atmosphere and close to home, can't ask for much more. The food is great, shrimp tacos and some tequila and everything is good with the world."}
{"text":"This place is just really adorable.  It has a tiki-theme and they have indoor and outdoor seating just about year round.  When it is a bit chilly there are heaters on the patio and an open firepit.  It's kind of a trendy little spot, and very popular.  I have had really great service all but one time I was there (everyone has an off night).  I love spicy food and the edamame is something I always get here, but they are not for everyone - apparently non-New Mexico natives find it too hot.  Whatever, wimps.  I am addicted to the fish tacos, and a friend of mind swears by the pork tacos.  You can get a couple of good drinks and a decent dinner here for $25 bucks easily, especially if you get there during happy hour.  There are even some semi-healthy options, although that is not their strong suit - with jerk pork you have to pay in calories for what you get in yumminess.  They have another location in Monterey and it is divier and beachier, but the same great food.  Go!  Eat!"}
{"text":"Marvelous place to go for Happy Hour. Great patio. Great atmosphere and nice service. Wednesday is Happy Hour all night."}
{"text":"Do you like being on vacation?  The only thing that's missing is the cliché Hawaiian music, which no one wants (except your Grandma).  You really feel relaxed at this place, and it has a very fun vibe though.

The bar has a great Happy Hour!  I don't know any other place that serves \"painkiller\" drinks, except in the British Virgin Islands.  It has rum, pineapple, coconut, and OJ.   Delicious.

The staff is always smiling.  Why not?  They're in a mini-paradise!  It's probably one of the friendliest places in town.

So two thumbs up for this place.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work literally right behind this place down on Highland, so of course it's been teasing me with a packed patio at about 5 pm everyday as I head towards the train to go home. I went yesterday during happy hour for our volunteer appreciation/camp wrap-up party and it was...ok. 

We started at about 4 and it wasn't too busy but but the end of happy hour the place was packed, inside and out. Being that its 50/50 inside and patio, I would definitely make it there in time to get a nice seat inside this time of year, as it would suck to sit outside right now. I totally dig all the old movies they play up on the tv bar and wall, it adds a nice sense of style to the place and the tunes weren't too bad either. 

Yes, they have an extensive list of specialty drinks. Because this was the case (and our org was picking up the tab), I thought I would break out and try a new flavor of beverages. I had the Dr. Funk and I also tried the one eye'd pirate. Both were pretty good but were pretty light on the alcohol. At $5 a pop it ain't bad during happy hour, but considering the amount of liquor, it doesn't surprise me how cheap it is. The beer list is also a great selection, which is what I eventually turned to.

We also tried some of their happy hour dishes; crispy shrimp rolls, fish cakes, pork tacos, and sweet potato fries. All weren't bad but nothing really stood out to me or made me wanting to come back again. Although I have heard great things about their regular food...Perhaps I'll try that next time.

One great thing about this place is they select different valley organizations and charities to benefit one night a week, for a selected month. Portions of proceeds on Mondays in June go to Free Arts of Arizona, so please go try them for yourselves."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time 5 days ago, then went again a few days later.  It was that good.  The patio is amazing.  The tables inside are gorgeous.  The pineapple wine is very tasty (not super sweet, despite what the waitress told us).  The shrimp tacos are ok...not the best I've ever had, but still great...especially with avocado!  The fish bites and the coconut shrimp rolls are ridiculous!!  The blood orange martini is tasty.  Prices are very reasonable.  Will definitely go back...fun to sit right on the light rail :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The drinks are delicious and strong. The food has always been amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic. Our wait staff has always been attentive to us. This truly feels like a local spot without being pretentious. We come back time and time again especially for the Wednesday all day happy hour."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed.  

The crispy fish bites were awesome, and the Ahi Wasabi bowl is my go-to which is crazy good. Had the Jawaican Jerk chicken plate a couple times (sometimes the chicken can be a little dry) which is also a good filling flavorful  choice.  No complaints on the warm brownie with macadamia nut ice cream either."}
{"text":"It's kinda like Captain Kirk walked into a bar with a ladyfriend who claimed Hawaiian roots through her great aunt by marriage and they decided to redecorate while listening to Air after a recent vacation to the Cape.  Then someone came in with a magic eraser hellbent on evoking the word \"sleek.\"

I actually find this place rather cute.  The Martha's Vinyard bathrooms don't make sense, but I like them.  The sweet potato fries were just so so.  Tiki drinks don't really do it for me anymore.  The fire pit with the party trick fire squiggle was neat."}
{"text":"The pluses.  It is close to light rail, the drinks are good (I'd like them a smidge stronger, but I have issues).  The minuses, I think the food it a bit weak.  That said, this still puts it above Trader Vics in my book.  The patio is great on evenings, the inside can get a little crowded for happy hour. I am a sucker for their drinks (still served in politcally incorrect Fu-Manchu style mugs).  Sweet potato fries are always good.  The edamame is spicy which is a nice switch.  The tacos are meh, the burgers are meh.  Really, you are coming here for the drinks and fun not necessarily for the food.  If they could make the food as crave-worthy I'd probably set up shop here and never leave."}
{"text":"It's the bees knee's man! 

We ducked into this spot on a rainy day for lunch and I'm so glad we did. My husband and I were sat right in front of the window and watch the cars splash by. I was going to order a Red Stripe (yes! they have Red Stripe) and the bartender suggested Longboard which they have on tap. This malty beer was a joy to drink, so refreshing, it hit the spot. For lunch I had the Hula's Island Cobb, very delicious. I was skeptical about the spam but it ended up being a great substitute for bacon. My only gripe is the chicken was described as \"marinated\" on the menu which sold me on the salad but when I had it the meat was plain. My hubs had the Luau Pork Sandwich and it's truly heaven on a bun, served with yummy sweet potato fries. Both meals were large portions and we finished every bite. 

We had a really good time at Hula's, great service, delish food & beer. We will be going back fo sho! Oh, and I should also mention that the silverware is now wrapped in cloth napkins. If I would have read these reviews before my visit Amy's \"fork door holder\" story would have kept me away."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and each time I'm pleasantly surprised. Service has always been friendly and efficient.  Food, tasty.  Would recommend the jerk chicken plate with a side of Mac n cheese to share.  It's a hit with the BF which is saying a lot.  
  The decor though is what I enjoy, modern...tiki...cozy.  There's fun out door seating, large bar area or nice dining area, so whatever your mood there's a place to park it.  I find myself always happy to return.  It's right off the light rail too, great for a night out or grabbing a drink.  
  Decent happy hour, decent desserts.  Overall, no real complaints... Not cheap enough for a weekly visit but we definitely make it here for casual nights out.
  As a real 'island girl' I'm not one for the foo foo tiki cocktails but I'm sure they're fun!"}
{"text":"The food. The drinks. The ambiance. The location. 
Hula's has it all and more, considering their incredibly friendly and professional staff. Manager Keith is infectious in his demeanor and incredibly kind and well informed. I believe I've found my new \"spot\"!"}
{"text":"We went here last Wednesday and it was delicious as always. All day Wednesday is \"Tiki Time\" meaning, Happy Hour prices on apps and drinks. I had the luau pork sandwich which the menus calls \"heaven on a bun\". The meat is cooked perfect, the bun is soft with a little bit of sweetness and the coleslaw is a great compliment.
My husband had the steak tacos which he said had great flavor. The patio is awesome and has a fun urban feel. You can see the light rail go by while hearing the bells chiming from St Francis church next door. This is definitely a restaurant to put in your regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Hula! Big props for the dog tolerant patio. They make my pooch feel at home. Food and drink is great! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Drink...don't eat. 

The environment, with the light rail shooting by, is definately a great place to enjoy an adult beverage. Regrettably, the only thing cooler than the environment is the food...as in the serving temperature. 
Speaking of cold - I have a natural tendency to dislike any non-ice cream item served with an ice scoop (like a grade school cafeteria - sides are scooped onto your plate)."}
{"text":"Enjoyed American-Tiki infusion. Started with an Ahi appetizer. Great ginger and avocado blend with wonton bites.

For my entree I had a nice Ahi Caesar salad with a spicy mango dressing. You have to try the Hula Mai Tai. Be prepared for the first one, it gives you a kick."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Hulas for some time, but could never quite make it over.  A friend invited me for her birthday celebration & I immediately RSVP'd with a yes, excited to try a new place.

Aside from our large party, the restaurant was relatively empty on a Monday night. Maholo Mondays... fantastic. They donate to a charity every Monday night & pick a new charity every month. LOVE IT!

Our server was great.  Witty, knowledgeable, and not afraid to make suggestions.  We had the Calamari appetizer and my boyfriend & I both ordered the Butterfish, but had it prepared in 2 different ways.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal.  The drinks were tasty, albeit a little pricey.  I enjoyed the slaw side, but wish that I'd had something other than plain white rice as my other side.  

I do think I'll go back in the future to try more tasty treats!"}

Hula's Modern Tiki
Show me what you got to eat
Drinks up, Luau Pork
A Longboard Lager can't be that bad
When it's brewed, it's brewed
Hula's will make you breakfast too
So come on, foodies, come on over
Let Bo Bites be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to eat with you 
Deep inside I hope you'll taste it too 
Waiting in a line for drinks and food
Just to be the next to eat with you

Hula's Modern Tiki is fast becoming one of Phoenix's downtown staple.  Always open and always on the trend of making this happen.  Seasonal and daily specials so this is definitely one of those places that is worth the visit.

Hula's, like the name says, is a modern tiki restaurant.  The displays and decor are not as tacky though.  Actually well maintained and a lovely spot to to hang with friends or bring a drink date.  I love coming here for brunch!  $2 mimosas and the menu is a knockout!  

We started with some spicy edamame and crispy shrimp eggrolls.  The spicy edamame made me want to drink more haha cause it was SPICY!  Loved it! While the eggrolls were crispy and crunchy from the shell. the shrimp texture mellowed it out.  I ordered the Luau Pork for my main; thought it was okay, I didn't care for the porky taste I guess, but my friend ordered their jerk fish.  Hands down I was so jealous cause it was damn good! The jerk was nice and creamy and with a kicking spice as it should be.  

Overall, service was very good and food was excellent as usual.  You can't ask for anything more from a restaurant.  Thanks Hula!  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm unimpressed, and not pleased.  The main job of a good bar is to make your day better, especially if it hasn't been a good one.  FAIL Hula's, FAIL.

A girlfriend and I went to Hula on Sunday after a ball game around 4pm.  We bustled up to the bar, hungry and thirsty, and ready to get some tipsy on.  I'd never been to Hula's but my friend had been here several times and said the staff was fun and the food was great.  

We were happy to see that happy hour was ON (and hence the 2nd star) but I was a little disappointed that food was not included in HH on Sunday.  Frankly, I found the dinner menu prices to be pretty high for sandwiches & burgers.  This wasn't some high class joint, and there were 9 gross flies buzzing around the bar and landing on the glassware.  My friend was looking on her phone and told me there was a Yelp special for Hula's, so I should check in via text for $5 off my bill.  Yay!  So with that I felt better about the prices.  

Well, when the bartender came to take our order, we tried to make a little conversation but he was very curt, cut us off, and asked if we were ready to order.  Seriously?  Your bar isn't full, try to be friendly!  Anyway, my friend showed her phone and got a COUPON for $5 off her next visit.  WTF - that's not what the deal said.  Then, when I mentioned to the bartender that I was having trouble checking in with my blackberry to get the $5 off deal, he just shrugged.  I tried to show him that the page was just spinning and trying to refresh, but he gave me an obvious, \"I could care less\" look and turned away.  Oh no you didn't!

Look, the Pink Bikini Martini I had wasn't even good (way too much sour, not enough alcohol to be called a martini), so I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with a pissy bartender on top of it.  I can drink at home, I can eat a burger at home, so if you're not going to provide nice service, there's really no need for me to be here. BUH-BYE!  

My friend told the bartender to cancel her food order because we wanted to go somewhere else.  That got his attention and he snapped at us, \"so what's the problem here LADIES\", but why answer?   We left and went elsewhere for great service, food, and drinks."}
{"text":"Is the food good? Yes it is. Is the food great? Ehhh. It's just pretty good. My wife and I shared two different plates to get more of a taste of what Hulas has to offer. I ordered a chicken breast burger of some sort with sweet potato fries. The burger was good enough, the sweet potato fries were luke warm and could have been a little crunchier. She didn't care for the cajun hamburger she'd ordered. I thought it was pretty tastey. She ordered french fries. Pretty average, nothing special. Overall, I feel there are better dine-in options on Central. I do like the Hulas' atmosphere, and it's likely I'll return to give it another go sometime."}
{"text":"We hit Hula's on a Friday evening to grab dinner and a drink. The restaurant is just a ways from the light rail so, from a convenience standpoint, this is a plus. We had a couple themed mixed drinks and, like others have said, they don't skimp on the booze. It was raining so the bar area was very crowded but props to the bartender for finding us and providing consistent service.

Not much to be said for the happy hour specials but Hula's isn't about $2 Coronas anyways so plan on having something mixed off the menu."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago we found Hula's on YELP.  It completely lived up to the reviews!  We will be back on our next trip.

Food - simply delicious.  Close to anything we've ever ordered in Maui.  I had the butter fish crusted in macadamia nuts.  Fabulous.  The mango chutney topping was the bomb.  Great flavors and combinations going on.

Drinks - excellent.  Well poured, mixed and delivered with love.  Staff - very helpful with recommendations and had a great sense of humor.  Ambiance - sit outsdie.  Awesome patio area with firepit-perfect for a cool February night.

Will recommend to all who visit from Chicago."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner. Great atmosphere with the indoor/outdoor space. I usually order something with ahi tuna because it is sooo good. I've also tried their pulled pork, which is equally as tasty. Drinks are strong!"}
{"text":"We there for happy hour a couple of times within a two-week period of time.   Korelie was our server the first time and Jennifer the second.   I don't know his name, but the manager/server was the server at a station I moved from on my second visit.   He looked and acted mad and impatient.  Since my experience with Korelie the time prior was soooo very pleasant, I moved to Jennifer's station since I didn't want the server ruining my evening.   We had the cerviche, the sweet potato fries. and, gosh, what else?   I can't remember.   As far as the drinks, we shared the scorpion bowl and I tried the blood orange martini.   The scorpion bowl drink was good.  The martini was too tart for my taste.   Would I return?    I dunno.  There are a lot of places in the valley to go for happy hour.   Uhmmm, probably not."}
{"text":"SOOOO Happy we stopped in!!!

My family and I were driving around this Saturday looking for a nice place to eat lunch. We happen do drive by Hula's and thought it looked like a fun place. We were so glad we stopped. 

First off, the design and decor of the space is amazing.  Very welcoming, modern and an overall cool vibe. My husband and I both noted we would love to come back again when the weather has cooled off and sit on the patio. 

For lunch I had the Fish Taco, my husband had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and my three-year-old had the Macaroni-and-Cheese.  Everything was delicious! The fish was well seasoned. I only wished I had ordered two instead of one!  The pulled pork was sweet and juicy. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I came here once for a work event and after a few hours my boss said he had to leave before I \"drank everything on the menu.\" I always have fun when I come to Hula's and I love their cocktails. I last wound up here with Laura L.; Liz S.; Tom S.; J.D.L. and Kelly R. after doing Happy Hour at Fez and we had a great time drinking and having some food. We had two of the whopping huge drinks that come with four straws and flaming rum in the middle. My favorite drinks are the Dr. Funk and the Blood Orange Martini but they have some great beers and lots of other yummy cocktails on the menu.

I also LOVE the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...DELISH!!!!! Great Happy Hour specials and an awesome patio....once summer is over!"}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour!!! We had the chicken skewers, pork potstickers, coconut shrimp, pork taco, and house salad. Everything was incredibly tasty and well priced. Our bartender Matt handled a full bar and restaurant like a champion and provided us with excellent service. We will definitely be back, thank you for a great date night!!!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell you how awesome this place is! The servers are friendly and the food is to die for! 

I went with my friends for my birthday and I was kind of nervous with there being 16 of us.  Often times, splitting checks, ordering etc can be a bear with a large party.  Not at Hula's.  Water and drinks were kept full and she was always checking on us.  I even got a bowl of the most amazing ice cream with macadamia nuts in it...with a candle! ;-) 

It's not often that everyone at the table enjoys their food...but it happened last night!  I ordered the calamari sandwich which was delicious.  The calamari steak was sliced and on a sandwich topped with some really good slaw.  I asked the waitress which of the fries were better and she suggested that I just mix them which I did.  The regular fries were good, but man oh man...the sweet potato fries were fantastic!  We started with some spicy edamame...take my advice and order some of it next time! You won't be sorry!  As far as cocktails go, I am not a fan of super sweet drinks so I asked our server what she suggested.  I went with her suggestion and ordered the Blood Orange Martini and ended up have 2 of them.  

All in all, Hula's made my birthday celebration very special and everyone enjoyed their time there!  We'll definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm ashamed that I haven't written a review on Hula's yet as it's one of my favorite places to dine when I visit Phoenix.

Being from Boston, I can safely say we have nothing like this.  Not even close.  So eating food with a Hawaiian and Polynesian flair is such a nice change from chowdah.  

First of all, the place has as cool, open vibe with an outdoor patio and firepit.   The service has always been excellent and the staff super friendly.

However, the real winner is their food.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.   From the spicy edamame (bring your tissues), to the johnny cakes, to the jerk chicken and mongolian beef bowls and fish tacos, it's all outstanding.  Their flavors work so well together, and everything is cooked to perfection.   I have never had a meal I didn't savor.

I come to Phoenix every few months for work and always try to make this place a stop.   Love it!"}
{"text":"This place was great!

Cool vibe. Lots of free parking.

Happy hour was great with even Hawaiian brews for $4.

Try the sweet potato fries!

Service very friendly.

On a nice evening you can enjoy their outdoor dining area."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks nice, but the food was incredibly meh. The ribs were anything but fall off the bone - very tough and rubbery.  And my wife's side dish was stale - clearly leftovers from a prior era.  My dad got a pulled pork sandwich - that one at least rates at 3 stars.  Still, overall I don't quite get all the high ratings."}
{"text":"This is denitely our \"go to place\" for hand crafted cocktails. Authentic island menu items are served. Service is always friendly and quick. These people know how to run a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"The fish sandwich never disappoints, and paired with the sweet potato fries it is divine! Great atmosphere and great drink specials for happy hour. Wailua wheat on tap!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here on Saturday night.  The weather was great and we were able to score a nice table on the outside patio.

The service was quick and friendly.  I had a beer and my friend had one of their specialty rum drinks that he liked a lot.  I ordered the blackened hapu fish plate that came with wasabi mashed potato and greens.  The fish  fillet was a fairly thin and I think that may have contributed to it being a little overcooked.

Overall it was a good experience.  Probably more due to being out on the patio and the good service rather than the food."}
{"text":"I incentivize my co-workers with food and drinks. If we get through this training ahead of schedule drinks are on me or at least the first few rounds. I purposely looked up Hula's knowing they have a good HH and good food. It happens most of my Phoenix office co-workers are foodies and were stoked to hear my plan. Well under time allowed me to get kidnapped to the range, grab drinks and apps, before my flight home. Hell yeah. Enough about the reason and more about the business.

The weather was hot, but the outdoor seating still looked promising and inviting, but I was in business attire so we sat inside. It feels like a retro modern Tropical, not so much Hawaiian to me. Lunch is the happs, apparently still packed until the later afternoon, early evening. 

Prices were excellent considering I bought a few rounds and the food was inexpensive, high quality. Poke was a little pricey, but it was MP. Good, but could do without the macadamia nuts.. Coconut shrimp rolls had a great pineapple horseradish sauce. Calamari had a lime ginger cream sauce which I will be emulating at home soon. Spicy seaweed salar was a pleasant offering. Perfect balance and something I think is an ingenious upgrade to the standard wakame that most places don't offer. Nice.

I wasn't a fan of the pork, but loved the sundried pesto aioli used, fresh black beans and corn tortillas. Habanero lime chicken use a taco slaw which I could have used less of. Really liked the south seas grilled hapu, and spicy tofu. Clean classic flavors most modern taco trucks don't' think is adventurous enough. 

I split the Jawaiian jerk Pork plate. Yes that's pork they also offer. Also split the calamari sandwich. Yup I brought my appetite. Loved the plantains which were bright and not overfried. I'm not a fan of most amngo salsa's, but the johnny cakes were excellent, more to my liking than overly authentic kinds. I wasn't a fan of the calamari and preferred the style and sauce of the app.

Key Lime pie to round out the meal. I thought it was bland. Couldn't quite tell if they use kahfir limes, but after about a half dozen D.r. Funk's I was ready to get my funk on. 

In an area most known for their Pizza, Italian this places stands out like nothing else and Arizona seems to be the new breeding ground for upstarts. Many of San Diego's chef's have opened up shop in AZ because they are ready for this sort of ingenuity. Glad I came. A few mediocre things don't take away from an overall good experience. Really the 1 star deduction was the service. It was slow, unattentive and just understaffed. Sure my drinks came like clockwork, but that's more the drunk vibe I give off."}
{"text":"Interesting that it is asking me to review them, and yet I have already... twice! Not sure where my reviews are going. Sigh, Great place for happy hour, people watching, dinner etc. Check them out if you are in the area.

Side note: Sorry that my review is not more thorough, but when you have already reviewed them twice and given rave reviews I am not sure what else to say."}
{"text":"Wow! Sat down for a quick refreshment and ended up staying all evening, the bartender Matt was hands down the most interesting man I've ever met, recommended the \"Dr.Funk\" and gave so much insight on the history of Funk music, I haven't stopped listening to Rick James ever since! I will definitely be returning next time I'm in the area, I just hope Matt is behind the bar."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here but moving away from downtown has moved me to a new watering hole but I do miss this place.

Food/drinks/happy hour/atmosphere 
I usually order the Dr. funk or the Hawaii 50 (both 5$ during happy hour) which are both great options if you like a fruitier drink, I would ask the bartender to recommend something based on your taste as they are usually nice enough to let you try it. I have tried a lot of their menu and the pork tacos (happy hour 3$) are a big stand out to me they taste like a kalua pig mixed with some great spices with a fresh home made salsa that has some spice but not much which is great. They have a great happy hour from 3:30-6 mon-fri and all night weds great time to check this place out if you are curious. The place is real laid back I have been there in slacks and dress shirts to basketball shorts and a white tee. 
The bad
I have had an issue with one waiter a few times (3 to be exact)in one such event I came in during their freaky tiki event where they had a buy one get one free. I ordered 2 dr funks for me and my girl who was running a bit late, he let me know that he would bring me one drink at a time and that I couldn't have 2 drinks. I explained the situation to him and he just walked off without acknowledgement and came back with one drink. We had to wait a while for him to come back as it was busy, not a very good experience but now when I go in I avoid his section so no problem. The parking is also a concern especially during the weekend but I have heard they are working that issue out.
Take a chance on this place you won't be disappointed even with a few hiccups this place deserves the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for happy hour after it was so highly recommended.  My cousin was celebrating her birthday.  It was a nice day out and we sat in the patio. There was a couple at the next table it was a high top bar. They had their dog in hand which was no big deal. I began eating and the dog was dropping poop in a napkin. From the arms of the owner which was 3ft up  into a napkin on the floor.  It was disgusting.  I spoke to the manager Ronnie and he said the restaurant is dog friendly, which I don't mind but it is a human restaurant where people are eating. He didn't refund me or offer me any compensation which was very rude and inappropriate.  

I will never go to this place again! I will advise my friends never to return. EVER!"}
{"text":"Hula's is my favorite place to be in Phoenix. The food is delicious and more on the healthy side. The drinks are amazing and, well, they are drinks - not so healthy =-) The staff are friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is relaxed and I love the fact I can sit at the bar, have some ahi tacos and watch an episode of Gilligan's Isle on the big screen - or wall which ever you prefer (the batman the movie is fun to watch too!)"}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed. 

I ordered the pork, egg, and hash meal. The pork was actually really delicious, and you can not mess up an egg. The hash is where it lacked for me. It was very dry and not flavorful. The service was great, and our waitress was very friendly. Probably would not come back, but worth a shot if you are near by."}
{"text":"This place is rockin! It's really easy to make tiki seem really lame, but Hula's does a great job of creating a cool, modern tiki environment. On top of that, the food is very tasty. 

I had the steak sandwich. The ingredients and seasoning mixed very well together. The steak was perfectly cook and was really great quality. Good prices for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for nostalgia so I really dig the tiki theme. I have been here several times and the food is consistently good. A place like this should have good Mai Tais...and they do! Parking is rough."}
{"text":"First time here. I decided to grab something to eat since my business partner was running a little late. We had an event to attend on the opposite side of the street. The service and food was really good. I had the Baja tacos. The order had taken longer than what I would have thought since I was the only one at my table. Outside of that plenty of food for one person. The only downside is my limes were dried out and not enough salsa. Outside of that I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Yes, this place. Just yes.

This place is awesome, and I don't even like rum. Their fries, beans, and food are all delicious, original and very reasonably priced.  I like to go places and cobble meals out of appetizers, which you can definitely do at this place, but the entrees are also very yum. Just eat everything.

The layout is nice and spacious, and they have a lovely patio. I used to frequent this spot when I worked in the area, and now I go because I just plain like the place. Catch a show across the street at the Torch!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Tuesday night with a group of 5. Waited for about 15mins for a table as they were pretty busy. A couple of big parties were there that night. Service was horrible! He barely said 2 words to us. Our food came out separately so we had to wait for everyone to get their meal. The food was surprisingly good. I had the habanero lime roasted chicken tacos. Except for the sharp bone found in my tacos they were pretty good. I would suggest making reservations or calling ahead before making the 45min hike across town to have dinner."}
{"text":"No time for a long, insightful, somewhat humorous review.

Hadn't been here in at least 2 years. Was a bit surprised it wasn't busier.

Calamari appetizer - it's a 4 but I love the sauce. Just a bit chewy which is ok b/c of the sauce.

Service was a 5. Suong was great (at least that is what I think her name was.

My wife gave the blood orange martini a 5.  Beer selection is a 3 (yes, I'm a beer snob).

For dinner I had a shrimp taco and a fish taco - both excellent.

If you haven't been here in awhile or if you've never been here, it's worth a visit.

P.s. We missed happy hour but there are some good deals."}
{"text":"I was just asked the other day to name off my top three restaurants in Phoenix and this was one of them.  I love all things Tiki and retro, what better place than Hula's Modern Tiki right. There is no other place in the valley that you can literally \"share a drink\" with some friends than Hula's by ordering a flaming scorpion bowl with long straws for everyone.. 

Between their own take on the famous Mai Tai and the Spicy Thai chicken, Hula's adds a twist to your traditional Hawaiian fare. To name a few entrees I have enjoyed and would order again: the  Thai Chicken Bowl is a must try, the Fish Tacos are monstrous, maybe a Pineapple Chicken Sandwich for some flavor, or the Wings for an excellent starter.  Sweet Potato Fries, Duh!! Grab a large order, you wont regret it.

If your there just for drinks and some patio time, you really can't go wrong with anything in a Tiki mug, just know your limit when it comes to a rum cocktail.. They call em' sneaky tikis for a reason!! For something smooth a cream try the Dr. Funk, it'll surprise you!! If not, stick with the classic Mai Tai, sailor. 

They have weekly happy hour and be sure to sign up for their Text notification to receive specials and secret passwords. Also, look out for their other two locations in Santa Cruz and Monterrey Bay. At every location the service, food, and cleanliness has been top notch. The staff is very friendly regardless of how busy it gets."}
{"text":"Cocoanut dessert is awesome. Have been there a couple times. Like the central Phoenix location."}
{"text":"I love patio dining so I am naturally inclined to enjoy this spot. The food was good but honestly nothing special. I wasn't feeling tropical drinks for my visit instead opting for wine and was really pleased with the by the glass selection. This is a great place for late night drinks and bites as well."}
{"text":"I love Hula's! One of my favorite places in downtown Phoenix. I go here often for happy hour and meals. For drinks, I prefer the classic Mai Tai but the Longboard beers on draft are good too and friends swear by the Tiki Bastard and Pink Martini. My favorite dishes are the Poke appetizer, pork tacos, Coco Joe's chicken, cajun burger, either steak (melt in your mouth!) or the rice bowls. The sweet potato fries and mac and cheese are awesome too. Pretty much everything I have eaten here is good and I have had many of the menu items. The service is excellent and friendly to boot and the atmosphere is hip but relaxed and not pretentious. The patio is fabulous when the weather is nice. I have even taken kids to this restaurant and it's been great. All around fabulous restaurant and bar!"}
{"text":"We were fortunate enough to have a great friend who knows her stuff. We met Maureen at the Hula Tiki Grill for a fun lunch.

The weather was perfect outside, so we sat underneath a half shade, half pre-summer bliss. We all ordered Mai Tais and they were amazing. 

We ordered taco plates, my guy got the chile chicken and I got the spicy shrimp and we shared one each. We are fans of trying errythang. Mo also ordered the chile chicken which was made with a fresh green chile salsa, mild yet flavorful. 

We stayed there for hours, drinking Mai Tai's and Kona beers like we were on a beach somewhere yet out in the heat. We had an amazing time with great service that I won't forget. Thank you Hula's."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of about 10 for happy hour on a Saturday.  We sat on the patio, which was nice with misters for the whole area.  Our waiter was attentive and didn't balk at seperate checks (which I've had happen many times).  We all got a variety of rum based drinks, which were all very good.  The food was also very good, I got the chicken skewers and the pulled pork, and both very well cooked and flavorful.  I would have liked more chicken, or some veggies, for the price.  The staff was very good, refilling waters and handled the larger group very well.  I enjoyed the enviornment.  I would go back."}
{"text":"The ambience is casual yet modern. The service is excellent, attentive but not overwhelming. The poke is as good as tasted in Maui. The lobster bisque is seasoned perfectly with a hint of spice. The fish was prepared just right and the kalbi ribs were delish! The rice, macaroni salad, and slaw were perfect compliments. The Mai Tai was strong and tasty. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"WOW - great food!

Their ceviche was the best I have tasted in Phoenix! The fresh Hapu  sprinkled with coconut served with jerk sauce, rice, plantains, johnny cakes was outstanding!

My friend order the coconut encrusted Tofu with tropical lilikoi sauce, rice, and fresh slaw.

To complete the culinary experience they have key lime pie - my favorite desert and one of the few restaurants in the valley to offer it - key lime is the perfect palette pleaser with a cup of good coffee at the end of a refreshing culinary trip to the islands!

Nice customer service friendly, efficient, and well mannered.

Met the owner Dana - wonderful and charming.

The experience was excellent! Of course, the company of a wonderful friend and fabulous conversation made the evening exceptional.

Definitely Hula's is on the list of favorites!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were having live music but I was not able to stay.  The food was good and not expensive. It's a small place so if you have a large group you may want to make a reservation. The banana cream pie is so good. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I was out in Phoenix for a conference and came here for a happy hour. It's a cute little restaurant with great outdoor seating around a firepit with plenty of heaters around. They even had old episodes of Gilligan's Island playing at the bar. 

The drinks are good, and the appetizers are fantastic. I'd recommend the ceviche, the sweet potato fries, and the crab cakes. The waitress was very friendly and felt comfortable joking around with us. 

Great location too, it's just right off of the Light Rail, so if you're staying at a hotel by the airport like I was it's very easy to get back from."}
{"text":"My how time flies.  I remember all the buzz when this building was being remodeled.  Now almost a year and a half after it opened, and a bunch of reviews, I finally had the opportunity to dine here.  I was amongst a Smunch group that met for brunch on a Saturday.  

I love the space. A combination of indoor, outdoor and part of both.  

The service for our party of about 20 was really great.  Our group consisted of folks from 1 to over 60 and all our needs were well attended to.

Their brunch menu consists of items from their regular corporate menu and some special items designed locally.  I chose the Island Eggs Benedict and enjoyed it and the hash browns it came with.  I ordered the decaf and it is the first decaf I have had in a long time that tasted like a real cup of coffee!  At least at our table I heard no big complaints about the food.

A couple of things that kept my rating at 3.5 instead of 4:  Parking sucks, this is more important to those like myself not used to uptown/downtown venues. One of my poached eggs was hard cooked in the middle.

I would certainly not complain about going here again."}
{"text":"Love Hula's! I have been going there for just over a year now, and take people there every chance I get. Everyone who goes enjoys the food, the atmosphere, and the service. It is certainly a unique place with a laid back attitude and funky decor, but it appeals to many people.
One of my favorites is to get the potstickers as an appetizer, followed by the luau pork sandwich- as the menu reads, it is \"heaven on a bun\". And that is an accurate description! The mixed drinks are great, as is the iced tea. If you have not tried the banana cream pie, get to Hula's NOW for this amazingly decadent yet remarkably light and delicious dessert.
The service is great, and the staff knows the menu and is happy to help you- there does not seem to be \"not my table\" attitude there- they want to make you happy.
I have had two birthdays there, as well as other celebrations. I am sad it took me so long to find this great place, but I look forward to many more meals there.
Note to fellow dog owners- Hula's is VERY dog friendly with seating on the patio with heating or misters depending on the season and water bowls for the pooches. Expect lots of visits from the crew of Hula's so they can say hi!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. We had a very nice server who's name is Suong.
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have driven past Hula's so many times and thought someday I will have to stop by, well thanks to another fellow yelper who set up an Happy Hour UYE, my someday showed up so off to Hula's I went!

What a great lil place, love the feel of it, makes you feel like you stepped out of Phoenix and are now at some island bar, I loved that they even had Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii playing up on the wall.

They have some pretty awesome happy hour deals, and on Wed happy hour is all night long. I ordered the Pink Bikini Martini which was pineapple infused vodka, sweet & sour & watermelon liqueur, garnished with a pineapple & cheery, this was a sweet lil drink, so very good! I also tried the Mai Tai, which was pretty good too, but I think the Pink Bikini is my favorite drink their so far! Also tried the coconut shrimp rolls, and I normally am not one to would pick a shrimp dish, but it said it came with a pineapple horseradish dipping sauce, I love pineapple, I love horseradish, so I had to try it!! They were very tasty and packed with shrimp, there was no shrimp shortage in those, and coconut gave it the perfect crunchiness! Very yummy for sure! 

Glad I have finally tried Hulas out and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I agree with Emily J.'s review.  I don't love Hula's but I like it!  

We sat on the patio by the heat lamp.  It was pretty dark in on the patio around 6:30pm.  We sat, we ordered, and we waited, waited, waited for the food.  It was a long while before our food came out.  We did not see what the food looked like.  It was so dark out.  The food was alright, but nothing that will make me drive out to eat there on purpose.  

The server was very friendly!  The hostess was a little rude."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and love their happy house specials. A LOT of specialty cocktails on happy hour and I was happy to learn that their weekend happy hour goes from 10:30 - 7pm...very rare to find a weekend happy hour! This is only for drinks, though. Food specials are only Monday-Friday. Every time I've been for a week night happy hour I make sure to get the mac and cheese. It's only $5 if I remember correctly. VERY rich, flavorful and comes out in a piping hot crock. I can usually only eat about 1/2 of it so it's also a decent sized serving!

I love drinks made with ginger beer (i.e. Moscow Mule) and they use Cock N Bull which is one of my favorite ginger brews. 

I'll be back again and again and again. :)"}
{"text":"WOW!  Talk about a metabolism booster....the Thai Spicy Chicken, was insanely delicious and full of flavor.  The staff was amazing with our large group including 4 kids under the age of 5!  Love the outside atmosphere and open feeling."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great bartender, cute place....what more could you ask for?  Went on a Saturday around 4 and they had happy hour for drinks only.  I had the Zombie, which was great!  It was very tropical and pineapply tasting and very large.  Not like a typical cocktail where you take 4 sips and all that's left is ice.  It lasted me forever!  I ordered the South Seas Fish Tacos and they were amazing!  The fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked up tender and juicy.  The rice and beans were super yummy too.  My only complaint is there could have been more beans on top of the rice.  The BF had the Crispy Spicy Chicken Tacos and loved them too!  Their margarita was great too, which I had for dessert.  :-)  Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"**Note** Changing from 1 star because the proprietor responded, researched it and found out he'd been affected by white tuna sushi elsewhere.  They're keeping 'ex lax fish' on the menu though.  I just hope they advise the possible side effects.

We had an early supper here, no drinks.  Had borh the blackened and pan seared  Butterfish, very good.  I'd never heard of butterfish before but took the plunge.

What happened when we got home caused me to look it up: learned it has good texture and flavor - both check.

So why the 1 star?  Seems that butterfish is another name for a fish called escolar, which has vast quantities of wax ester in it.  Another name for excolar is \"the ex lax of fish\".  Right on.  For both of us,  We got lucky apparently, it is often worse and lasts for days.

Why have it on a menu when it can have these kinds of side effects?"}
{"text":"Saturday or Sunday it does not matter. Either is a great day for brunch here. Good options and the mimosas keep on coming."}
{"text":"We decided to try Hula's one Sunday afternoon after having a horrible experience waiting over a half an hour for a table at a near empty Oregano's.  I'm glad we ditched Oregano's with their lousy service for the accommodating staff at Hula's, as it has now become a regular hangout for us.  

The atmosphere is modern and very relaxing.  Can be a great place for drinks or dinner.  Nicely situated along the light rail and across the street from a large cathedral, it's probably one of the few restaurant patios in Phoenix that offers more than just a view of exhaust fumes from passing cars.  Love the gas fire pit in the center of the patio.

A lot of great options on the menu, especially the seafood centered appetizers.  My personal favorites are the pork tacos and the Teriyaki New York Strip.

Their tropical drink menu may be their real highlight and seems to attract a lot of local hipsters.  I always stick with their Mai Tai, which isn't overly sweet and packs a good punch.

The owner seems to care a lot about his restaurant and is very welcoming to his customer's.  It's nice to go to a place where you're recognized and appreciated as a regular."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be that girl who writes a review just based on drinking (boo! hiss!) but know that I am wholeheartedly returning to fully review Hula's from soup to nuts.  Whether soup and nuts are on the menu that night or not.

From the start, Hula's seemed way up my alley - the fine marriage of sexy-class with kitschy tiki wonder.  The name says it all, and my being a girl who enjoys a little Polynesian flair, I just had to go.  The space is intriguing - like a modular spaceship tucked into the desert, decorated by a holdover from Trader Vics.  I came here to drink while waiting for friends and was bowled over by the Happy Hour prices in correlation to the quality of the drinks.  I had just read a scintillating post on ChowHound about the oft misunderstood Mai Tai - no pineapple juice or grenadine but copious amounts of rum and a bit of Orgeat (an almond liquer).  Hula's is as authentic as they come, addictively drinkable and potent while still maintaining the smoothness and characteristic flavor.  I fell in love.

Servers and bartenders are laid back and charming, and the atmosphere is bubbly without being too boisterous.  I'll definitely come back and tuck into food next time, because you all know I can't just sip and dash."}
{"text":"Wednesday's here rock it out!  Happy hour prices all night on cocktails and appetizers.  My favorite drink here is their margaritas.  Strong and good.  2 of these for $10 gets your happy on!  The ceviche is perfect with the line notes leaving it my favorite ceviche.  The hapu and Mahi are great macadamia crusted fish entrees.  My go to regular is the Thai chicken bowl.  Staff is friendly and atmosphere is open.  Diversity is welcome here."}
{"text":"Came here before Back to School night for a nibble and it has a great happy hour.  Special appetizer menu is all $6  and great deals on cocktails. You must have the Mai Tai here!"}
{"text":"Matt once drank 5 Amstel Lights and told me a story that really didn't have a climax. I'll never forget that Tuesday, such a beautiful Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"Always love this place. However today was miss informed about brunch and happy hour prices from one server to another during shift change and was given attitude about it when given the bill. So sad about this because I have always had excellent service here before. Especially with a large group of us."}
{"text":"Good god, after two trips I can say there is maybe two things on the menu if we were to return i would order. One is an appetizer and the other is a side.  The ahi poke salad and the plantain bananas.  Everything else I have tried as far as the bowls go were absolutely gross in my opinion. I couldn't even stomach the ahi bowl and I LOVE ahi! So i pushed aside my bowl not wanting to tell our waiter i was absolutely disgusted with it since i think thats just rude to say that and omg my poor sister who is a vegetarian wasn't very hungry ordered a side of mac and cheese and said it was the WORST mac and cheese she has ever ate.  I would have easily said something to the waiters about her food since shes my baby sister and as skinny as they come i would tell her to stop playing with it and to let me say something but she just picked up maybe a noodle every  5 min and put it back down.  I would have thought the waiter would have picked up on our lack of interest in our food with completely full bowls but obviously no S**t's were given.  Nice to know hula Nice to know."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Hula... we went for brunch, promptly seated, Drinks were awesome.. food delish.. waiter Kyle very nice"}
{"text":"Hula's was my very first check in on Yelp, over a year ago.  It was not until recently that I even began writing reviews, now I'm addicted.  I used to live closer and we would go during Tiki Time.  I had a bad service experience and ceased coming until my wife talked me into going again.  It is what it is and I am happy to have gone back.

Hula's is one of the few places that offers \"Poke\" so this is one of the main reasons I am now a fan.  Their Poke is a different style then I am used to, but good none the less.  They also offer nice stiff drinks and have a nice selection.  I honestly have to say I have not been overly impressed with any entrees I have had, but definitely enjoy the appetizers.  This doesn't mean that I will not try more, I just have to find the right one.

I almost gave only 3 stars, but because of the Poke, drinks, and your outstanding building I upped it to 4.  I will be back and hungry for more Poke, thank you Hula's."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They had empty tables and the kitchen was backed up. We eventually got seated and left there. We ended up leaving hungry and thirsty :("}
{"text":"Best poke in town. Although probably the only poke. Seriously, I recently had poke in Kauai at a top 100 yelp restaurant and this  actually compares favorably. It needs a touch less soy sauce though, and macadamia nuts not in any poke in Hawaii.

ADDENDUM
Owner sent me a kool email.  It is nice to know they care!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice decor! Great place to go with good company! Efficient and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place is really cute for ambiance but the food was pretty out there for me. I would definitely recommend this place for a happy hour or drink destination but don't recommend any of their meals."}
{"text":"Friday night and Im wanting to go somewhere with a cool atmosphere and some good drinks and mabey some good food. Well they had two out of three. The atmosphere is great. Love the patio with the fire pit and the bar is nice as well. I like this part of town and the restaurant fits in here well. The special drinks they have are great, I could suck them down all night,  but I was really hungry and could not wait to try the food. The food was very disapointing. Everything they serve has some crazy sause on it. I like sauces but I just feel they need a little more work on all the sauce i tried that night. The butterfish was cooked well and was great when I scraped all the sauce off of it. That fish is good and doesnt need a sauce like that. I understand the kind of food Im eating but mabey thay need to lighten  up the sauce a little. All the sauces I had seemed like they put a  mango and a pinapple in a blender and then poured it onto my food. You could not even taste the fish. It could be anything under that sauce and that would be all you taste. Then we went for the NY Steak sandwich. It comes with sauteed onions( enough onion for about 6 people) a roll that just falls apart the second you pick it up, and sliced steak that is way to thick and oh yeah one of those sauces again.  I dont mind my sanwiches being a little messsy but after two bites my sandwich looked like it was murdered and scattered all over the plate. When you took a bite everything fell out of the ass end of the roll. When I order a sandwich i dont want to assemble it after every bite nor do I want to eat my SANDWICH WITH A FORK. And again it could have been a piece of plasitic under that roll cause all i tasted was the sauce. I will say the sweet potato fries were not to bad. I dont like sweet potatos really but these were good. I did find out later that they do have regular fries but THEY DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU, not sure why mabey cause they dont want you to be happy or they are just pushing the sweet potato fries. Whatever the reason I did not like that, cause I would have prefered regular fries.  Im there to eat and if you make it put it on the menu! Overall this place is cool and the servers are friendly, attentive, and knowlegeable about the menue     ( - the fries) but I think the Head Chef should sample all the dishes himself and think about what he is doing in that kitchen. This place could be so much better. Prime location, great atmosphere, just lacking in the food department. Im not sure if all the good reviews are from people that got sidetracked from the atmosphere or if they dont know food and thought they were eating something special or if they had to many drinks before the food. I wanted to like this place so much. I will be back for drinks and to relax by the fire pit but Im not sure i will eat here again."}
{"text":"Style over Substance. The decor and theme are cool. The staff is a bit smug and pretentious. The food is overpriced . The Pork Sandwich was tasteless and gross. The salads are on a bed of ...lettuce. Just very low grade food."}
{"text":"I don't love Hula's, but I like it!

I absolutely adore what they have done with the space, it has one of my favorite patios in Phoenix! The servers are over-the-top friendly and excited which makes me happy to be there :) I'm not a big drinker but the Dr. Funk is probably one of my favorite cocktails I've ever had. 

My biggest problem with Hula's is just that the food isn't that great. I have tried quite a few menu items over various trips and I am just not knocked out by any means. 

I think the best way to do Hula's is happy hour. $5 cocktails, $5 apps (I actually like their appetizers more than many of the entrees!) 
Happy, indeed!"}
{"text":"A trendy place in CenPho..when we got there the place was jam packed.. It was happy hour..we ended up sitting on the patio which was nice. We started with the coconut shrimp egg rolls which were amazing. I got the shrimp tacos and my buddy got the rice bowl and after seeing it I wish that I had gotten it..all in all great food and service and nice location on Central Ave."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hula's Modern Tiki for about a year now and I have to say I haven't been disappointed. Being a big fan of Trader Vic's and Smuggler's Cove in San Francisco, I'm also pretty impressed.  The Polynesian style menu is creative and quite good (the pork tacos and the spicy seaweed salad are two of my favorites). The cocktails are outstanding. You'll find not only the traditional (really good Mai Tai's) but also drinks with a \"twist\" (try the Juan Ho)!
 
With a diverse clientele, the atmosphere is very \"hip\" and stylish (à la modern tiki). Seating includes the main dining area, the bar lounge, or outside on the large central patio. One of the best attributes of Hula's is the staff. Just about everyone working there is thoughtful, fun and attentive. Even the owner's a really a nice guy (he's often around). Did I mention they have one of best Happy Hours in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Happy hour on saturday was from open until 7...which isn't common! The Mai tai is not your normal fruity concoction! It's a strong drink!!! Only $5 a piece is a steal! The mimosas are $2! Very modern building! Bartender was wonderful and very helpful in offering drinks to our group!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Used to be my Sunday spot. Great rum drinks, the bowls are amazing and the shrimp app is to die for"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and had the awesome Calamari Sandwich!  The Calamari is lightly battered and is in large strips, looking more like a chicken breast than the tentacles I'm used to.  The sandwich was topped with Hula's special coleslaw that gave it a nice bite and crunch.  The Calarmari was tender and not rubbery at all.  The sweet potato fries were great side dish.  An excellent lunch meal.  My only complaint was that I was sitting under an airduct that was dripping water on me."}
{"text":"Great little patio on Central Ave.  Had drinks and apps the night we arrived in PHX. sampled about seven different apps and they were all very tasty, the Crispy Fish Bites being one of our favorites. Would definitely stop back again."}
{"text":"with so many positive reviews on this place, I was expecting much better. Went with my gf on Monday afternoon. We ordered a spicy thai fish cake for appetizer, a mango bbq rib and a jerk chicken for entrees. The fish cake was ok but a bit salty. The ribs were a bit dry and DRENCHED in bbq sauce. The jerk chicken had too much spices so it was a bit salty and the meat had a mushy texture. The service was doing good but I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we meet at Hula's for drinks and dinner and from the description it sounded great, I had just hoped it would hold up to everything she said and it totally did! 

The atmosphere is great, staff is super friendly and made some great suggestions and the food was really good too. The banana coconut cream pie is freaking amazing! 

We will absolutely be back to this place and bring friends."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. At least at night it goes down hill. Where are these people coming from? Geeze, I feel like I walked in to an episode of Jersey Shore. Blegh. The food is still pretty good, the volcano bowl is disgusting but worth the try. Hubs and I went one night just to hang out. It's so cramped. You are sitting on top of everyone around you. The good part of that is we had some good laughs at some RIDICULOUS conversations that were happening around us. I won't be visiting this place at night ever again. I may hit up Hula for some mimosas though. This place is much better for a nice brunch than it is for a night out."}
{"text":"Loved this place! 

The sweet potato fries were yummy, & the small was large enough for 3 of us. The Hawaiian ceviche & the coconut shrimp rolls were DELICIOUS. I washed that all down with a drink called THE PAIN KILLER, lol, but I'm pretty sure it's a pina colada of sorts :)"}
{"text":"Since we have been to their Scottsdale location a few times and loved it - we of course had to head to the original! We opted to sit at the bar and enjoyed that they had the patio completely open so we could enjoy the amazing night despite not sitting outside.

We made it a point to head out on a Tuesday since it was 2 for $20 appetizer and drinks night.  Of course we went with the staple Dr. Funk for our drink (couldn't pass it up) and I had the coconut shrimp rolls, while he opted for the wings and added on the small fries ($4).  The food was great, the projector on the side of the ceiling was fun, and the ambiance overall was a winner. 

The only off thing at this location was the bill.  We got our bill and the bartender ended up having to explain what was done. It looked like they rang up our food and drinks and then rang up the $20 deal, so our total was originally $68 dollars, of which they took $38 off in discounts, which was still off, since with the two app, two drinks and fries it should have been $24+ tax, not the $30 it was after all the odd line items.  We are guessing that something wasn't accounted for in the discounts? It was too confusing to argue over the extra money since we weren't even sure where the mistake was!

Overall: A-
As expected the food and drinks were amazing, the staff was friendly and ambiance was great (really cool patio, funky window facing out to a church, projector movie on side of ceiling, etc.).  Only downside was a confusing bill, but sincerely doubt that will prevent us from returning again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hula's plenty of times before when I used to work close by.  I don't remember why I wasn't that big of a fan as I haven't been back in a while.  My bf has been wanting to come try this place out.  

The weather is starting to cool down, their patio is spacious and open and it wasn't busy.  The service was ok - not the best.  The four stars is based on a happy hour experience.  The drink options were great and I ordered so many happy hour items that I was stuffed.  Items on the table include hawaiian ceviche (good), crispy coconut shrimp rolls (ok), sweet potato fries (can't go wrong with sweet potatoe fries), spicy thai fish cakes (ok), calamari (not a HH item, but tasty), and pork tacos (good). I also ordered a drink, but don't ask me which it was because I don't remember.  It was good though. 

For two people, it was around $40 - but both of us were stuffed."}
{"text":"I can not say enough about this fabolus spot! From the patio, to the long board bar (and the long board on tap!) I've been several times, and every person ive brought, or come with, loves it. Great date spot, great pre funk bar, or after hours wind down location. Everything on the menu is bomb! From the Shrimp spring rolls, the ahi tuna, the fries (sweet potato or regualr) the hula burger.... OMG... im craving Hula now! thank's yelp, for making me think of this moth watering spot!"}
{"text":"My friends rant and rave about the happy hour specials and the drinks here.  Unfortunately the first time I was here was during Lent and I don't consume alcohol during this time so I was only there to eat.  I'm not a big fan of the food so it took a while for me to come back.  On a fine night when a friend was heartbroken, I figured why not give Modern Tiki a chance to mend his broken heart?  It was a perfect idea.  I called up a couple friends so we all came to Modern Tiki expecting a good time.  We were greeted by \"Thor\" (a nickname my friend gave one of the servers because of his nice looking beard), who was very friendly and provided awesome service! I started out with the hurricane, ooooooh wheeeee it was some strong stuff!  Next, I shared a Volcano (the taste was a bit tangy for me) and my friend's wife suggested I try The Itch because I get a backscratcher with it.  Hey! why not? At that time, my mind was clouded with good conversations, great friends and delicious drinks.  Towards the end of the night, I was not sure if my friend's heart felt better but I was sure the rest of us felt great!  I am a believer that Modern Tiki will solve any problems I will have in the future. Thank you for a great time!  Until we meet again =)

Few words about the food:
Burgers- bomb!
Tacos-good and huge
Sweet potato fries- on par
Spicy edamame- yummy!!!
Jerk chicken- on par"}
{"text":"I was tempted to grab a grass skirt and wiggle into Hula's for their Tiki Time Happy Hour (Monday - Friday 3:30-6pm). But I opted for the Phoenix summer staple: a sundress and flip-flops. Love the mid-century modern feel. That gets a star :)

It was around 5:30pm and it was busy, but our server came over and took our drink orders when she saw us join a friend's table. I asked for Malibu and Pineapple and my friend Zombie'd out. We were given menus and she left without clearing any plates on our table, where our friends had several (not to mention a couple empty glasses).

She came back with the Zombie and told me they didn't have Malibu (what a disgrace to Tikiville's everywhere!!) but the bartender said I wouldn't know the difference and to bring me this. She set it down. I looked at her and said, \"No, thanks.\" AUTOMATIC MINUS TWO STARS - one for NOT having Malibu and another one for trying to pass the fake crap off.

I ordered the Surfrider Chicken Sticks and Steak Tacos while my friend ordered the Mango Chicken Caesar (someone else in our party had ordered it and enjoyed it). She didn't take our menus and all of our drink glasses were empty. A few comments were made about this.

Ten minutes later, we get the Surfrider Chicken Sticks which were SET ON TOP OF MY MENU (damn, really??). They were cold. Decent, but cold nonetheless. My friend's salad came and I was told it would be a minute for the tacos. Another 20 minutes and they still hadn't come. Not to mention my empty plate SITTING ON TOP OF A MENU, empty water glass and my friend's empty glass.

A couple friends got up to leave and their empty plates and glasses remained even after WE got our check. I was billed for the tacos but I never got them. It took another 10 minutes for her to return with a correct bill. 

Awful service, cold food, no food and a fake-Malibu serving bartender give this place ONE star in my book."}
{"text":"I've had some varied experiences at Hula's so I've never sat down to write a review- I've never had a full meal, and it usually seems to be a place that I hit up on a night where I'm bar crawlin' all over CenPho.

However, there are two specific experiences that made me feel compelled to write a review:

1.  On a Sunday funday when I didn't really need another cocktail, I found myself here.  I asked for a recommendation and was told that the margarita is very popular.  I tried it and was not happy.  Without saying a word, I handed it back to my server.  He smiled at me and took it off the bill.  I'm glad he understood what needed to happen without me having to open my mouth.

2.  Last Friday, I fell down and scraped the hell out of my knees.  Hula's was where I was heading, so despite the gushing blood, I went right ahead with my plans.  Although they didn't have any band-aids (I believe the manager put it on his to-do list), the hostess was SUPER awesome.  She sat me in a high top chair, helped me cover my wounded knees with square napkins and taped them up for me.

So, yeah, in my mind, Hula's is pretty effin' solid.  I've heard they have a ton of veggie options, so I'm hoping to have a sit-down meal soon."}
{"text":"Hula's is by far one of my favorite restaurants. I have had the Hawaiian ceviche(love this), teriyaki steak, and the Jerk chicken. Everything is soooo good. The food I have had have a light taste to them not heavy at all. I only get to eat here a couple times a year, but every time we go it is good. I brought my friend and her husband here and now they go every much for their date night. I don't want to forget about their drinks that come in large bowels with an extra shot that's on fire(literally)."}
{"text":"Service: Slow! But very friendly.

Food: The fish is always good, and they have a great selection of tacos.

The best: The patio! This is the best patio in the valley. You get great people watching, Light Rail watching, and sit in the beautiful Arizona night.

Get the Pork Tacos. They are on the Happy Hour Menu, as well."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant  last night and it was AMAZING!  My party ordered a variety of appetizers and drinks and everything was wonderful!  The tofu spicy taco was amazing  and there were many vegetarian options and pescatarian options available.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late dinner.  Nice relaxed Tuesday evening meal.  Tried the Bastard cocktail, poke, and shrimp roll - enjoyed them all.  Good service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really yummy food. If you want drinks, go during happy hour; for food go during dinner.

In the dead of summer the flies are not a problem, mostly because the doors are closed."}
{"text":"I went here with my foodie friends and we universally agreed the appetizers were spectacular but the entrees were just ok."}
{"text":"Well cross my lucky stars twice!! Went back to Hula's after we already had dinner just for drinks on a very busy Saturday night, because I love their fu-fu drinks, and got kind of forgotten about whilst already seated and seeing another party right next to us get served even though they sat after us. After telling the hostess we would like some service, the manager came out and apologized profusely, 6 times in fact that night, he said drinks were on him. When the bill came out the waitress said that our whole bill, 4 drinks, and two appetizers were completely comped. I tipped her 15 smackers though, as she really was trying to keep up, but this huge banquet table that was there before us all wanted seperate checks--The nerve! oh well that makes my bill comped twice at Hula's...Well I'll still go there again for lunch or so. I just love my Hula's and the atmosphere is to die for."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Omg the food was shockingly good ... A little spicy yes but excellent.
We are here on a Tuesday so we had the \"2 N 2\". 2 drinks , 2 apps for $20!
A great deal! We had:
Drinks- dr funk and painkiller( tropical / like pina colodas on the rocks.both drinks came in cool glasses!
Apps: Hawaiian ceviche , albacore calamari( sauce on this was awesome)
We were still hungry:
Lobster bisque( a wee bit spicy!)
Ahi tacos - spicy as well and even the beans had some heat...
Very hip looking place w/ a great vibe .. Very casual and it even has an outdoor fire pit!
Hopefully we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and absolutely loved it. The server was super sweet and recommended some really delicious cocktails to try.

Their chicken skewers were amazing! The hula burger is yummy too! I was a little disappointed with the macaroni salad...Maybe because I was comparing it to the macaroni salad I had in Oahu but not a deal breaker. Also the pulled pork was delicious too!

Love the outside seating area."}
{"text":"We had so much fun here.  It was such a beautiful night too.  Our server was awesome. The food was awesome! Everything about this place was awesome. Definitely going back. Loved the laid back open air seating."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night with my whole family to celebrate my birthday.  No one in our group had ever been there before, so it was a treat to try out a new place... but, also, sort of a gamble, because we weren't sure what to expect and we have quite a few picky eaters in the bunch.  To my surprise and pleasure, everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal!  I got the Luau Pork Sandwich, which the menu claims to be \"heaven on a bun\" and they were not lying!  It was so delicious.  The boyfriend got the Bali Hai BBQ Ribs and the meat was literally falling off the bone.  It was perfectly cooked.  His only complaint was that the sweet potato fries were too sweet and didn't go with the ribs.  I think he would have preferred the wasabi mashed potatoes instead.  I wanted to order one of everything off the drink menu, because I couldn't make up my mind.  Everything sounded good!  Our waiter was so attentive.  He very discretely circled around his tables every few minutes or so to make sure everyone was taken care of, but he didn't interrupt the meal, unless, of course, you flagged him down for something.  It was a really great experience and I can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"At the end of an action-packed Saturday including a hair-raising drive and strenuous hike, it was time to simply sit back and R-E-L-A-X.

My friend and I declared that Pain Killers on Hula's outdoor deck were just what the doctor ordered.  There is something very right about the combination of rum, coco lopez, pinapple and orange juice.  Since Hula's has all-day HH on Saturdays (ending at 7pm), these beauties will set you back only $5 each.  Bargain!  We kept telling ourselves \"hey, we burned like 2,000 calories today.  We EARNED these!\"  They came with a fruit garnish, so technically they were \"health beverages\", right?  :)

Our very cool waiter took good care of us, and even shared a little background on his detailed tattoo work.  While I don't have any ink, I love hearing the back stories behind people's art - interesting!  

As the sun made it's way down on this good day, the deck, the fire pit and of course the Pain Killer elixr made all those bumps, bruises and scrapes earned on the trail just seem to disappear... for a while, anyway..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Extensive drink menu all reasonably priced.   Good sized patio for dining outside.  Had Duke's pork plate: Excellent"}
{"text":"How can you not love a place that pours drinks this strong? Especially when they're only five bucks during happy hour! I think that I've sampled them all at this point, and haven't been disappointed. For the most part, they are exactly the kind of drink you would expect to find in a tiki cup or dodge little paper umbrellas or fruit skewers to get to - all fruity and full of tropical booze. Ahh, I can practically smell the salty ocean breeze and feel warm sand between my toes. In my opinion, the best of the best are the Blood Orange Martini, the Mai Tai, and Dr. Funk. So what if Hula's wait staff hasn't quite gotten the hang of prompt service as long as I've got my Mai Tai and sweet potato fries. 

When I finally made it beyond the happy hour, I found that Hula's is more than just great drinks.  Let me tell you, when they say that their pulled pork sandwich is \"heaven on a bun\", you'd better believe it. I don't know whose idea it was to throw some coleslaw on that heavenly bun, but that person deserves a medal. The combo of that tender, warm barbeque pork with some cool, crisp coleslaw is just magnificent. Word has is that their burgers are also pretty tasty, but I haven't been able to get away from the pulled pork, and apparently the burgers are too yummy for my friends to offer me a bite (not that I've ever shared my sandwich)."}
{"text":"So I had a first date and needed to pick a spot to go.  He was naming the places and I was yaying or naying them.  He said there's a place where you can sit outside and there's a fire pit and I was sold.  I got there first and got us a table outside and under a heat lamp and the wait staff was really nice while I waited, making sure I had everything I wanted.  He got there and we both ordered a beer, and he got the hula burger and I had the coconut shrimp roles with a side of plantains.  The shrimp rolls were good, not amazing but I would get them again and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  I stole a few fries and they were awesome.  I wasn't that impressed with the plantains- I'm used to a different preparation but they were okay.  I would definitely go back for the great atmosphere and to try out some of their specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Hula's was super fun, with a cool vibe.  Staff was great; we were seated promptly and server was terrific with our group of 7.  Loved that she gave us a waring for one more round before happy hour was over.  Such a nice thing to do.  We loved the appetizers and the fish was fresh (Phoenix?) and the shrimp rolls and taco's were terrific.  I highly recommend Hula's and was glad we found it!.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place put up with the drunkiness we came with! 6 girls, on the prowl--what could go wrong? Not much at Hula's!! Wonderful, affordable food and drinks. My only complaint is we had a reservation and waited around an hour for our table. Not much of a complaint; we sat at the bar and drank ALOT!! Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Have you tried their  banana coconut cream pie???? Get your butt over there and get it. There was even a layer of chocolate in there !! That is insane ....it was insane and only $6. Go get it right now."}
{"text":"This place has the best seasoned tofu I have ever tried! Being a vegetarian, it's difficult to find variety outside from your junk food such as fries and salads. Their spicy tofu tacos were such a delicacy that I crave for it out of nowhere just because the texture of the tofu and the seasoning were prepared so perfectly. Not only that, but their rice was literally the best rice I've ever tried! It was so soft and that is exactly what I love about rice! Not only that, but was there a hint of coconut to it? I've been told Hawaiian rice contains coconut. My parents recently went to Hawaii and fell in love with their rice because of the hint of coconut in it and have tried to remake it in the same flavor and texture but have been unsuccessful. Maybe I'll take them here one day to see if this place lives up to their expectations of Hawaiian rice!"}
{"text":"Ahi tuna sandwich and fish tacos were bomb!!! Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hula's is awesome.  Here's why:

1. Great name
2. Strong drinks during happy hour (actually all times but this place doesn't water them down during happy hour)
3. Yummy appetizers
4. Tofu tacos (vegetarians rejoice!)
5. Outdoor seating
6. Strong drinks for $5 - yeah I know I said that twice

My favorites are the Pain Killer and the Blood Orange martini.  I'm a light weight so one drink is plenty for me.  Also the Scorpion Bowl is fun to share - emphasis on sharing!  (Please don't try one by yourself.)"}
{"text":"The food here was straight exquisite. I ordered the calamari sandwich and it was awesome. The staff here is all very young but incredibly friendly and efficient. Everyone knows the restaurant menu up and down. I always enjoy having a late lunch out on the deck. I wish there was a valet service to park the Phantom, as there is very limited parking available due to it being downtown. I don't recall the exact menu name item; however, if you're looking for a petite desert I would definitely recommend what I believe is the tilapia tiramisu. It's the perfect blend of protein and a savory desert. Overall it's a very vibrant atmosphere and I would recommend anyone looking for quality food and service. MMG"}
{"text":"Great beer, excellent food, nice wait staff.  Had the shrimp tacos and they were amazing.  Unique place...I was a fan!"}
{"text":"A Phoenix gem.  The food is excellent.  The atmosphere, service, and staff is even better."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour and to grab a light dinner. I was hoping they had Katsu on the menu but they did not. The menu didn't have many light optins that i was interested in. Obviously it's a tiki and Hawaiian theme so I was hoping they would have one of my Hawaiian barbecue favorites. I settled on the fish sandwich, which was very tasty. Perfect seasoning and the fish is not a deep fried patty like most it was lump fish meat (can't remember which fish variety). It was really tasty. They have tiki mugs for signature drinks and 4 taps that serve only Kona beer varieties. Overall, I liked the concept and would probably come back with friends."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Had the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious. The enviorment was decorated in reto hawaiian stuff. With a very open air feel. The server was very nice. We enjoyed our time her very much."}
{"text":"The coconut pie is the BEST!!!! I love it! Everything on the menu is a safe bet! On special occasions they do have live music which is a nice touch! Outdoor seating and fire pits are a great! Drinks are pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful first time! The server was very nice and he was attentive an very suggestive with orders! The spicy chicken thai bowl and the chicken tacos were great!! The food is of great quality, fresh, nice presentation, and portioned nicely. I will definitely be back with some friends and what an awesome happy hour menu."}
{"text":"My dear Hula's,
What happened today? Maybe it was the lunch rush, but that's no excuse. Our ice tea and water tasted very weird and slightly sweetened. If you're trying out something new, it's not a good idea. our food, which consisted of a lunch salad, sandwich and sweet potato fries took forever. The fries were cold, the ahi tuna very very over cooked and hardly any pink. Please get better soon. I will probably be back, but I will make sure it's not during lunch and that I order something different."}
{"text":"We couldn't figure out why the lunch menu was so short but when we got our food we realized why! The portions are beyond generous!

I had the Luau Pork Sandwich which was absolutely enormous! There was pork and slaw falling out onto my plate.
While the slaw is slightly different tasting, it is complimentary to the flavor of the pork and the sandwich was excellent. 

It wasn't very busy when we went and the atmosphere is nice and modern just like it says! I can imagine this place gets pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night considering the set up. 

This would be a good place for a date but I am not sure that I'd take my kids, the place is kinda small and intimate, more for couples. 

I will definitely go here again to try something else!"}
{"text":"Went back to Hula's for a little pre-bday brunch with some family.  6 of us left trashed and full of delicious food for less than 150 bucks.  I'm not talking about lightweights either. We had a pretty serious collection of empty glasses goin on.  The pork hash was delicious.  Eggs came out a little less runny than I would like and they rushed back to grab me some new ones without making me feel like a d-bag.  Hula's is quickly becoming a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Looking for a great date night? Girls night out? Drinks for one? Go to Hulas. Hostesses are always on point. Brooke and Paige are total hotties. Bartenders get the job done. That guy Andrew with the beard is bomb.com. Servers are fast and the opposite of furious. Bailey is a total babe! And where my gay guys at?! Keith attracts both guys and girls! Need a good laugh? I think the manager Kyle always has the wittiest shirts on. Two words: sex Panther. Yup keep a look out! I recommend fish bites, poke, hula burger with cheddar and potstickers. Out of the cocktails I would get the sweet and delicious pink bikini martini and the tangy blood orange martini on the rocks. The atmosphere is top notch, especially when the weather cools down, they turn on the fire pit on the patio. So romantic! Head to Hulas and please feed your soul."}
{"text":"Ambience: When I went to Hula's Modern Tiki, the weather was nice out and I loved how the restaurant was open to the outdoors. I could feel the breeze, and it was just good vibes all around. Unfortunately, partway through the meal, some additional guests were placed right next to us, and because the sliding table wasn't set up very well, we ended up bumping elbows a few times, which was a bit awkward. The service was attentive and kind, and the waitress suggested some kind of tea that was absolutely scrumptious. 

Food: The samurai beef sticks appetizer was DELICIOUS. A little expensive, but we loved the dipping sauce, and the beef was also well marinated. My s/o got the luau pork plate, and weirdly enough, he said it was the best pulled pork he's had in Arizona. Mushrooms and eggs are my favorite food items in the whole world, so I was beyond ecstatic when I saw the description for the Loco Moco. Unfortunately, I found the burger patty dry and the mushroom gravy excessively goopy, but then again, I've never been to Hawaii. The fried plantains were nothing special, but still very yummy."}
{"text":"I love the location - Mr. K calls it uptown and that sounds about right.  Anyway, I love that uptown is getting more places around to hang out at night, and some that are actually hip!
I also love the decor - simple, yet modern, and with a few island-style pieces, of course.  Best thing is the big patio with fire pit, the indoor/outdoor seating, and the huge long community tables.
We did not eat, so I can't comment on the food, but the island drinks were definitely good.  They have a decent selection of beers and prices on both beers and cocktails are GREAT!  $4 for Hinano, $6.50 for mai-tais, etc.  I have paid upwards of $14 for drinks like that...
Service was great - multiple waitresses coming by to ask if we're doing ok, need a refill, etc.
Only negative, which I expect/hope will change, was that it was not at all packed at 11 on a Saturday night.  Uptown doesn't need dinner places, it needs bars!
Side note:  if it was packed, I think parking would be a little tight (but then again, it's right next to the light rail, so you could just train there!)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have been here several times all on Wednesday nights when they have all night happy hour.  The place is always crowded with a lot of energy.  Here are the items I have tried.  Food:   Jerk pork plate , ceviche, pot stickers, pork tacos, spicy Thai fish cakes, coconut cream pie, regular and sweet potato fries, fried sweet plantains.   All wonderful, no complaints.  The only negative is the pot stickers only come fried.  You cannot get them pan fried or steamed.  (At least that is what we were told by our food server).  Drinks:  Zombie, Mai Tai, Painkiller, Hula's Hurricane,  Dr. Funk, Hawaii 5-0.  Favorites  are the Painkiller and Mai Tai.   The Mai Tai's are a little more tangy than the traditional.   Fun atmosphere.  Indoor and outdoor setting.  Great place you will enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"I had driven past this place many times and finally made it in this weekend! The food was excellent ! I had the Ahi Wasabi Bowl and it tasted amazing. My friend ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and it had great flavor as well.  The sweet potato fries were really good but not the best I've had but that might be because I have a favorite place for that.  When it comes to drinks .. I will give them kudos because they are tasty and pretty strong!  Service was great! Definitely visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries Cooked well ... Unique sauce - mayonaisse, inversion ipa beer, blood orange martini, dead on sunday at 17:00 but nice... Spicy thai fish cakes, butternut fish w/ macadamia nuts, excellent & prompt friendly service.  Perfect for getting some eats and drinks after our long flight.  Great environment and clientele -- loved the open space and and bar."}
{"text":"it's not a big place, so don't come here in the middle of dinnertime and expect quick seating. That being said, come a bit earlier, put your name on the list, and then try some of their fantastic cocktails at the bar. Their drinks are great and the food doesn't disappoint. Try the calamari appetizer, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Third time's still a charm! 
This time I got the Luau pork sandwich which is sweet, shredded pork on a bun with coleslaw. I'm usually not a fan of slaws but this one was not too sweet and really complimented the pork. And, as before, the sweet potato fries were awesome with Hula's dressing dip. 
Super friendly server on the patio, too.
Also used Yelp to get $5 off when I checked in - so without a drink, it was just over $6! Awesome deal.
I'll finally give it that 5th star for service, taste, environment and prices."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Most things are not so good and seem like previously frozen items. The service was decent."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Burnt burger. The salad and the chicken dish were really tasty, tho."}
{"text":"It seems as though Hula's has hit their stride. I read back through some of the earlier reviews and it looks like they've fixed whatever their issues were. 

I went with two girlfriends. We were greeted immediately and the host was funny and attentive. He told us the wait was 15-20 minutes. We went to the bar and 10 minutes later he personally found us and seated us. 

I had a pink bikini martini.. perfect.. just perfect.

We shared an app of calamari.. AMAZING. My friends ordered two different versions of the Mahi and both raved about it. I ordered the jerk chicken and it was delicious. 

Love the decor, the open sided buildings, the patio, the firepit. 

I actually texted my husband while I was there to tell him how cool the place is and that we have to go back together. 

With three entrees, an appetizer and five girly drinks we got out of there for under $100 with a generous tip.. which reminds me, the service was great."}
{"text":"Very cool building and great spot to go when its nice out. They open it up and looks really cool. Pretty good bar food too if you are just getting a drink a good place for just a drink and appetizers too. Portions are big on most items."}
{"text":"Wow. We went here on Christmas Eve w/ a group of friends. The happy hour prices here are awe-some, and the drinks are super tasty.

Love the tiki-chic ambiance and the patio is killer. Our waitress was probably the most attentive waitress weve ever had, she was awesome.

Cant wait to go back for another happy hour and some food!"}
{"text":"mainly for their drinks and the happy hour on Wednesdays!!! We had many different things for food and all tasted really good. The place has nice decoration and you really feel comfortable wherever you sit.

The 5th star will come when they don't force you to tip :) (Can't I decide if the service was that good or not?)"}
{"text":"I love discovering the great places downtown and now Hula's will be added to the list. 

Had lunch there today with the fam...enjoyed every delicious bite of the Thai chicken bowl. Mom had the flank steak sandwich and shared a bite...that will definately be the next item to fully ingest.

The atmosphere is charming and eclectic...looking forward to the temperature cooling to enjoy the fire pit outside along with the great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been wanting to try this place and finally made it.  Of all nights to come, we timed it just perfectly to enjoy their Happy Hour Menu that was available \"all night.\"  They offer many tropical themed drinks and we sampled their Hurricane, Mai Tai, Tropical Itch & a Zombie.  All were very good.  We also sampled pork tacos, surfrider chicken, pot stickers, spicy edamame and kona wings.  It was all great and our server, Cherise was very friendly and quick to deliver everything we ordered.  Would definitely come again to enjoy the same as well as other items."}
{"text":"I had the steak and added shiitake mushrooms and they already cut the steak in pieces with the mushrooms.  There was fat mixed in so it was sometimes gross, because it is a little dark inside the restaurant where you could not really see what you were getting.  

It came with mash potatoes that tasted instant with a taste of horseradish.  My coleslaw was warm and did not taste that good either, server was nice but food was no good."}
{"text":"Food and service are great! Cool atmosphere also! I'll be back for sure!  The fish tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"So it's been 6ish years since I was in Phoenix, but a few weekends ago I came back. I was with a different friend and definitely had a different experience. We were in for dinner and drinks this time and sat at the bar. Drinks were perfect! I had the tropical itch and my friend ordered several different ones. We had the ahi appetizer which was great and then I had the steak tacos and the brownie for dessert. Steak was cooked to perfection and damn if the slaw or seasoning in the rest of the taco wasn't a spicy surprise! I'm not into spicy, BUT I enjoyed it. The bar staff was attentive and always checking in to be sure we were taken care of. I will definitely be back next trip."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's really cute for happy hour or date night. I have not found something on the menu that I didn't like. The food is amazing.

For drinks, try the blood orange martini. Yum."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, loved the Wasabi mashed potatoes substituted for the rice in my Thai Chicken Bowl.  Wowzie... And it's a big meal for the price, I have left overs for tomorrows lunch

The atmosphere is chill as advertised and the staff of engaging without being overwhelming.

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! I've had the Hawaii 5-0 & the Lilikoi Margarita- both drinks tasted great! The chicken wings and crispy coconut shrimp rolls were delicious!"}
{"text":"Unapologetically kitschy and undeniably wonderful.  The staff is very friendly and cool.  Their deals are great.  The menu is delicious-- especially the appetizers (hello, crispy coconut shrimp rolls and sweet potato fries with aioli.) The Lilikoi margarita is my go-to drink. It's just an all around fun place to go, especially when it's not too hot and you can enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Brunch!
Scorpion Bowl!
MIMOSAS.

Service has always been stellar, and you can't go wrong with any of their cocktails!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is unique and delicious and the atmosphere is so cool. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"It's kinda hit and miss here.  First time, got great service at the bar and the apps were good.  Second time, called in to see if they had food late, they said yes, I double checked the kitchen times, and headed down.  Took forever to get a menu.  When I did, it was a tiny (all-fried) late night menu--closing in 5 minutes (not 1hr 5min, like I was told).  The bartender seemed irked with the hostess for telling me wrong...whatever.  Then he chatted with a friend until we decided to go elsewhere. Not impressed. 
I'll give it a third go probably.
Cool bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hula's is a great little bar. I like it a lot. Their drink pours are strong! I still haven't had any of their bowls, as I haven't been there when I want to get wasted! 

The food is pretty good. I've had dinner and brunch there and been absolutely fine with the food. As with most of Phoenix, its a little pricey. Not ridiculous though. 

Get their drinks! They specialize in that! Dark and Stormy would only be made better if they used better rum (Whaler's? C'mon...I thought you wanted to make me a good drink) try Kraken in those (they didn't have Kraken when I asked).

Sometimes they have Gilligan's Island on the TV in Espanol or Frances, which is fun!"}
{"text":"Throw the word \"tiki\" into any phrase and you've got a party.  No exception here.  Hula's has perfected the art of combining meat with fruit/sweets (love the coconut shrimp rolls) and those Hawaiian inspired cocktails that knock you on your butt.  Want a drink that's on fire? No need to head to Springfield for a Flaming Moe, you can order a cocktail here that literally comes in a flaming bowl.  

The atmosphere is fun and the place is bright and cheerful in the day and dim and cozy at night.  The service is always excellent.  Or maybe that's just what you think after a couple of their drinks... 

It's a great little spot, definitely worth your time to check it out!"}
{"text":"Love it here! My favorite place to order a burger throughout the valley, which seems weird since it is not a burger only joint, but oh my goodness they are delicious! The meat is so moist, and the sautéed onions are out of this world, topped with melted cheese and a perfectly toasted bun and it's perfect! Not to mention the sweet potato fries are delicious! I come here with my family, my friends, and my boyfriend, and I enjoy it every single time. I love their appetizers along with the ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm giving this review 5 stars purely on tue customer service alone. 

We slid into this joint on a sat evening around 8pm. There was a good crowd going, but not packed. We were allowed to pick our own seat, and our waiter greeted us promptly. I ordered a Mai tai ( the drink is strong, and I recommend it). The drinks came out quickly, and we put in an order of pot stickers. I can't say I enjoyed them too much, they were crunchy, like deep fried instead of the traditional pan fried. We then ordered the entrees. I had the spicy thai chicken bowl, and she had the pork tacos. The Thai bowl wasn't spicy, but it was HUGE and good. The pork tacos though...were much better than what I had. It made me wish I had ordered those instead. Lastly we ordered chocolate macadamia nut brownie that was delivered hot, with a side of vanilla ice cream with nuts in it. The brownies were very rich, and the ice cream complimented it very well. 

The highlight for me was our server. He was very prompt with the service, gave us excellent recommendations, and catered to our every need. His actions alone made the meal."}
{"text":"Color me convinced.  When I first heard about the concept of a modern tiki restaurant, I was skeptical.  When I saw the early demo/renovations to the classic uptown building, while hanging out at neighboring Lola's, I was worried.  After stepping inside today, however,  I realized that my skepticism and worries were unwarranted. Hula's Modern Tiki is a great addition to the uptown dining and lounge scene. They have effortlessly matched an uptown modern vibe with a retro tiki kitsch.

The cocktail menu is quite extensive, with a lot of fun options, including Dr. Funk, served in a Fun Man Chu mug and the Tiki Bastard.  They also have a variety of bottle beers, including some choices from the Caribbean and Hawa'ii. Their food is all island inspired, with a hearty collection for seafood based appetizers (pupus) and mains, as well as some other island inspired selections, such as Duke's Luau Pork Plate.  Our food was well flavored, especially my wife's fish tacos.  On the down side, my pork was on the dry side.  To their credit, after mentioning this to the owner, Dana, he took 50% off the entree price).  The servers and staff,  were extremely friendly and attentive, perhaps a little too much so, although i chalk it up to opening night jitters and a full staff fort a less than full house. 

Give the cool vibe, great seafood and wide drink selection, Hula's Modern Tiki is set to become an uptown classic, especially as they work out a few remaining kinks in the kitchen.  As you begin migrating out to the patios with the cooler weather, be sure to stop by Hula's-- it's patio, complete with fire pit is a great place to hang out over a cocktail or two, or even more,  given its proximately to the light rail."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends for drinks and grub. I keep it pretty basic and get either the Polynesian chicken sandwich or my new favorite the fish tacos. Also a fan of the black bean burger. Awesome sweet potato fries. Dip them in Hula sauce if you wanna be extra indulgent. I even took my parents here when they were visiting and both really enjoyed their dishes. Hula's is a win."}
{"text":"Hula's is a great addition to our neighborhood, and we've never had a disappointing experience. Great drinks, fresh and tasty apps and main courses, and a very cool staff. We usually go on Monday nights and John takes great care of us at the bar. He makes us feel welcome and appreciated. Thanks, John!

{"text":"My daughter and I came on a Wednesday night. It wasn't too busy and we got a seat by the fire. The server was very friendly and said we could order off the happy hour menu even though we weren't in the bar. We had the tofu tacos and Mac nut crusted tofu. The tofu tacos had great flavor. I would probably skip the Mac nut crusted tofu. The tofu was more soft than I was picturing and I just wasn't into it. It also came with rice and some cole slaw."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to us and really made an effort to make amends for our experience. He let us know that any of the ahi dishes are available to be prepared unseasoned. So if you like your ahi, ask for your dishes unseasoned! Or lightly, either way. I always appreciate great customer service, so I've updated the rating :) Thanks!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! We thoroughly enjoy our happy hour specialty blood orange martini 's on Sunday happy hour for only $6.00 and the seaweed salad and ceviche appetizers we're the best! We sat on the patio which is also conveniently pet friendly!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. My first time here for a late lunch/early dinner. We arrived around 435 and there was only a few other people there, which was nice. They have a happy hour menu with some food options, so we ordered a mixed basket of fries. I got the black bean burger and caesar salad, and my friends both ordered the vegan jungle tofu. They loved it. I expected my burger to have a different consistency, as it was more melted than I anticipated. Still good, I liked the shiitake mushrooms. Service was good, water was filled often, and they provided the standard to go boxes. They opened the glass window to the outside and since more people came, it got loud. Their seating area is nice. I'd go back and try their seafood options."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken was pretty for this not be resturant dedicated to jamacian cusine. I would order again. Also the drink I had was very tasty and smooth.

My waitress was great! They comped our drinks for keeping us waiting and I didnt feel like we were waiting long at all so I felt much obliged to compensate her with a tip. She had a nice personality and made my friend feel at home for her 23 birthday with a nice ice cream concoction.

I will definitely be visiting again! I want to try more of their food gems and explore the drink menu"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The staff is disorganized and you really cannot tell who is working there. The busboy looked like some kid who just walked in off the street. The food was just okay. The jawaiian jerk chicken plate; favor was okay but the rice was gluey and the johnny cakes where very dry and only one plantain slice?  The loco moco; the burger patty was burnt and tasted like old grill. Once again the rice was gluey and the gravy had a skin on it. About the only decent part was the egg. I have far better at plate lunch joints for half the price. This place says tiki but really doesn't deliver.  The signature cocktails are okay but not true to tiki and the staff seemed oblivious and as if they would rather be somewhere else."}
{"text":"My final meal before leaving Phoenix, I was turned onto to Hula's because of a random friending on Twitter. 

Having been to the islands a few times, I was intrigued, and convinced my family to go, and we were happily surprised. 

i got the Butterfish, done Jamaican Jerk style. The fish came cooked perfectly, smothered in a spicy jerk heavy sauce. One the side, it came with plantains, which were lightly fried( but I suspect they were actually bananas). Crispy on the outside, warm and mushy on the inside. 
The rice was decently cooked, and had great flavors all throughout. Lightly sweet, lightly spicy, it was great, but certainly could not stand on it's own. The johnny cakes, while flavorful, were very dry for my palette, easily the worst part of the meal. 

The shining star at Hula's were the beverages. My wife got the Mai-Tai, which was as authentic as the ones we've had in Hawaii, and perfectly mixed. Her second drink, a Watermelon martini, tasted exactly like a Jolly Rancher, if you like that sort of thing. 

I had 2 drinks, the Zombie and a Painkiller. The Zombie was fantastic, dark rum flavors and passion fruit swirled around in my tiki mug, and mixed with chunks of fruit to make a delicious beverage. However, the Painkiller was much better. Dark rum, coco lopez, fresh squeezed pineapple and oj worked together to make an excellent drink. I wanted 3 more of them, but I needed to get going. 

When I return from NYC, I will definitely be checking out Hula's again."}
{"text":"Personally, it's the little details that set a restaurant apart from the rest. The little details like allowing reservations, asking if the check will be split and not having that bother you one bit, smiling, etc. Hula surprised me with how friendly and wonderful the service was. They are certainly doing something right here! The food was delicious as well. I ordered the White Fish Ceviche and Steak Sandwich. Both dishes were so impeccable!

The only thing I would change about this place is having it be closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Hula's is a pretty chill place. It's a nice setting and atmosphere for Phoenix. Cool outdoor/indoor area, you can bring the pups along if you want. This was my first time here and will be back starting out the celebration for my birthday in a few weeks. Drinks have fun names, some come in fun cups and drinks are strong. Now the few downsides are...this place is pretty pricey for drinks and food especially for its location...and happy hour is only from 330pm-6pm during the week, pretty short amount of time compared to other places. Best time to come is for happy hour because the prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour! Food and drinks were great. Open air! Bartenders were really nice, fun. Seemed to like their jobs-a rarity these days!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more....

Arriving early to meet a group for a birthday dinner, the husband and I sat down at the bar to soak up the atmosphere. While the hostess was a bit off the bartender was nice and attentive while we waited for our party. The drink menu is intriguing, but the 2 drinks I did have left a lot to be desired. I do not like overly sweet drinks, but both of my drinks lacked any fruit flavor which was odd considering the laundry list of ingredients in both.

Once we were able to figure out the seating situation (our party grew by one) our waitress was attentive. The menu has some interesting choices. Not being a fish lover I felt their apps were very limited- I like sweet potatoes fries but some variety would of been appreciated. I had the pork plate and enjoyed it it more than other in my party enjoyed their choices.

Overall the experience was fine. I found their prices to be reasonable and I really love the space- but I was just not really blown away."}
{"text":"Love this place, not the usual sushi or seafood joint. Love the Hawaiian touch on all of the dishes, it's just right, not overboard. Great customer service as well, our waitress quickly took care of a kitchen mistake and took it off our tab. The location and building is very unique and super convenient to my home in the midtown area. My favorite dishes are the fish bites, the samurai sticks, and all of the tacos I've had have been fabulous."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday here last night. The cocktails were fantastic, potstickers were amazing, great food and atmosphere. Our server, Brooke made wonderful recommendations, and overall it was a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend the evening."}
{"text":"Fantabulous Downtown Phoenix lounging spot... great concoctions, super food, superb services and magnificent ambience - can't ask for anything more! Fab!  We keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  I have been 4 times now, and just simply love it. I mean I went on a Saturday and always myself there the very next day, its just addicting. Three out of the 4 times I've been I've sat at the bar, and the bartender, is great.  He's always got suggestions, tells what he likes, his fav's what he's had and hasn't had and why.  He's even got suggestions on the very cool all day (10:30-7pm) happy hour drinks on the Saturday/Sunday menu.  What a deal!!

The food I've had is outstanding.  One thing I'll never forget is the butterfish, that was melt in your mouth delicious!  The wasabi mashed potatoes was not what I thought they would be so at first I was disappointed.  I expected them to be spicy and creamy, but then I sat and thought about it again, and said wait, these are exactly what they should be, Mashed potatoes infused with wasabi, kind of like cucumber water.  I believe I just had the wrong idea to begin with.  The seaweed salad is a great starter, a huge portion and tastes like seaweed salad.  This was my pre-Brunch visit.

So this past weekend I tried the Brunch.  Saturday's visit was later in the day and I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I went with the Fish taco.  Another fish done well, perfectly done and seasoned.  Much to my surprise they give a little bit of what appears to be homemade salsa, that goes with it and is yummy, i found myself trying to figure out exactly what was in it so I could go home and duplicate.  My boyfriend had the pork taco's, and I really enjoyed the pork flavor.  I was expecting greenchilli ish type flavor, but it was very sweet barbequey.  The black beans and rice aren't anything special, but not gross either.  Then Sunday I tried the Ahi Eggs benedict.  I was so scared, as I said I'm not a huge breakfast fan.  It was awesome.  Very very good flavor.  It got cold real fast, but that's my experience with eggs..

Recommended Drinks:
I think I've tried at least 2 other drinks from their menu, but I can't remember what they were called...but these are the ones that are normally at my table:
Hurricane, Tiki Bastard if you like Gin, Blood Orange Martini, Mai Tai, and you must at least once try the Bloody Mary.  I believe they make their own mix, it's got a bunch of horseradish bits in it, and is very different.  Its definitely missing the worchestire, but was actually not bad with out it.  I agree it isn't for everyone, but I had two."}
{"text":"The husband and I had driven by Hula's multiple times, saying it looked interesting but we were always on our way to another destination. We finally stopped in on their 3rd Anniversary and boy, are we glad we did. The wait for a table was probably 45 minutes, but the place was packed and in all consideration, it wasn't as long as other places we've been. Plus, we wanted to sit outside, since a band was going to be playing. (Who were awesome, btw.) Drinks were $3 all night, special anniversary prices, and we tried the Dr. Funk and the Painkiller. The Dr. Funk was delicious! The Painkiller is similar, but had cinnamon or another spice in it that I didn't care for.  I ordered the coconut shrimp egg rolls to get us started and they were fantastic! For dinner, I had the coconut encrusted butterfish and the husband had a pork plate. (Mine was delicious but the pork was just okay.) Our friends had steak tacos and a salad. The steak tacos looked so good, we had to come back a second time. The second time here, I had the steak tacos and the husband had the steak dinner. Mmmm, the steak tacos were totally worth it. (We also ordered the coconut shrimp rolls again - definitely a favorite.) For dessert, we got the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream. The brownie wasn't anything special but the ice cream was good. When we checked in on Yelp, we received $5 off our bill. This was a nice surprise! Totally check this place out - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Hulas has been amazing! we were greeted by the nicest hostess with the huge smile. Our server was super attentive and indulged all of our crazy needs. Food was amazing definitely recommend the poke the burgers and the Ahi Benedict. The tiki drunks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Really cool location and atmosphere.  The island/tropical themed cocktails are pretty awesome.  I love the coconut shrimp rolls but I wish the menu was a little more robust.  Not a ton of options.  Overall, still a really good spot."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel nearby and stopped in for lunch. The bartender, Matt, talked to me for 2 hours about designer cutlery. I thought I knew it all but I was sorely mistaken!"}
{"text":"Ah, to the many countless nights I have spent here soaking up what I refer to as \"the best drinks in the valley\" hands down. To the mornings I have spent recovering from similar nights.  Hulas will always be on the tip of my tongue the second someone ask \"where should we go in Central Phoenix?\"  

The fish cakes are amazing, as is everything else.  The service is incredible.  The ladies there make sure I am never empty handed (even if that means delivering it to me while I get distracted hitting on certain people ::clears throat:: Dana)

Hula's is where I typically bring my first dates, just ask the servers I'm sure they will attest.  I have held my last two birthday parties here and they are always more than accommodating.  

Whether is brunch, lunch, dinner or drinks you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love that this place has a Saturday happy hour! We came for drinks and an appetizer before going out and it was great! The decor is super fun to watch. They had a move playing in the background as well. Lots of servers were around to help others too! The drinks were yummo and the food was great, we had sweet potato fries. I will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. 

I am in love with Hula's decor, ambiance and overall sexy swagger.

And every time I head down Central, I make a point to stare at it, hoping I'm stranded in traffic to lust over its gorgeous window. 

I've had some pretty solid drinks here and some not too bad breakfast, but sadly, I can't even remember what I've specifically eaten or drank here the multiple times I've hung out, which is why I cannot give Hula's more than three stars.

However, I also never recall a bad food experience, and when time and chance has it, I will not hesitate to return. Especially because I always remember the crazy conversations and company I've had while enjoying time there. One time I was there with a group for some afternoon cocktails for hours. Hours. I think probably 7 tables rotated next to us the entire time we were there and our server switched at least once. That, my friends, is a sign of a great hang out."}
{"text":"Went to Hulas expecting to have a nice meal but instead we waited for 10 minutes and received no service.  We at least got water but no one came to our table.  There was wait staff walking back and forth in the dining room but we were never acknowledged.   I was going to go all Jack Nicholson on them like he did in As Good As It Gets when he asked for his waiter but I didn't want to cause a scene.  Won't be going back there."}
{"text":"My picks:
Dark & Stormy
The Pink Bikini 
Abalone Style Calamari
Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls
Macadamia Encrusted Butterfish

The happy hour is a steal and I love that they have a dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Love the place...it has got great cocktails that you can share like the volcano.
The outside seating is great as long as its not July.
I have a lot of Vegan buddies,so they love it for the different Tofu variations,but my favorite remains the Jerk chicken"}
{"text":"I really, really like it here. The staff is friendly, attentive, greets you as you walk in and the food/drinks are great! I think the old movies playing add a nice touch, too. I'll definitely be bringing all my out-of-town guests here."}
{"text":"I think I may be obsessed with this restaurant. I've recommended it to so many people. It's a retro tiki bar, with really friendly service. I get the fish tacos, and the fish sandwich is TDF too. Also, try the Hangover drink - well, actually try any of their cocktails. Sweet potato fries FTW. They're also accommodating to big parties if you call ahead. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid! From brunch to happy hour to dinner, I've had many great experiences here with food, drinks, service and atmosphere. Some of my favorites are the fish bites, steak sandwich and mango Caesar salad. If you're into cool vibes, good food and a no-fuss atmosphere definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I'll get the drama out of the way now and say, unequivocally, I love, love, love this restaurant.  My wife and I are vegetarian, and it's not only veg-friendly, it's excellent.  Their veggie burger is one of the best I've had in the city, and Dr. Funk may be my favorite drink of all time, with the Scorpion Bowl coming in a close second.  Spicy tofu tacos?  Excellent.  My favorite dish is, by far, the Jungle Tofu bowl, which should always leave me with a to-go box, but is always consumed fully on the premises.  I almost never get dessert anywhere, but their key lime pie is the best I've had since Key West...no kidding.

Parking can be a bit of a bear on the wrong night here, but my favorite time to visit is on a Saturday afternoon when it's almost always quiet and relaxing.  We have an electric car, and their two charging stations are a plus, but at night they are almost always occupied by gas burners.  

And before I forget, the staff here has always been lovely, from the hosts, to the bar and wait staff.  

As a last word, Hula is my go-to place when I need to relax and forget about my troubles.  They really make me feel like I'm on a tropical island."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere...what more can you ask for?  Casual setting with full bar and many unique island drinks.  Large food portions at very reasonable prices.  So much to choose from and they all look so good! Across from Swirl and parking is free! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! I wasn't able to make reservation for 6 on Saturday, because entire day was full; was encouraged to go in and possibly could be seated if a reservation was canceled. I asked if I can get a call back to confirm an actual reservation, Kyle said no because he doesn't expect any cancellations. I said, \"why would you encourage me to go if no tables will be available?\" He replied, \"you can hangout at bar.\" Where is the customer service?! Very unprofessional. Lack of customer service. Definitely will no be going back. Thanks but no thanks Kyle!"}
{"text":"Stop!
In the name of all  island BBQs...
I dared to stop by with a friend after spotting all the updates happening to this renovated showroom.  I will give 4 marks to the design aesthetic.   Lured in by the many tiki mugs on display which are show only, I was thrilled to see a menu containing a fusion of Hawaiian and Caribbean blends of culinary art.

I had a Jawaiian choice which included jonny cakes....something that I haven't had since my momma stopped making them for me!  These were a close rendition but I will not let my momma know.  

I am pleased that the clientele lured to this place seems to be sophisticated and sober, something often missing in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night for Happy Hour.  The place itself is absolutely adorable from the Hawaiian decor to the Elvis movie playing on the wall. Very retro Hawaii.  The pation is large and spacious and the firepit was pretty at night.  I ordered the plaintains and they were delicious. The calamari, however, was not.  Very rubbery and the breading was soggy.  Two friends both ordered the Thai Chicken Bowl and couldn't stop raving about it."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Great experience.  My new favorite Central Avenue corridor eatery."}
{"text":"Read the Yelp reviews and wanted something different...this was perfect. The the modern setting with big open air setting.  Sad no dark beer on tap.  But the food knocked my socks off.  Best ahi burger I have ever eaten. Actually everyone enjoyed their meal immensely.  Only bummer is you have to order fries on the side...no likely that.  Our server was very good.  An very nice choice.  Thanks Yelp reviewers makes choosing so much easier!"}
{"text":"Delicious, is the only word I can use to describe the fantastic Scorpion bowl, an alcoholic drink for two. My house salad was delicious along with my spicy Thai chicken bowl. My love, had the chicken sandwich, which he loved. Our waitress Bailey, was super friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be returning specially to try their Hawaiian chicken and also their Volcano Bowl (alcoholic bowl) meant for 3-4 people."}
{"text":"I already loved Hula's before even stepping foot inside. I am a sucker for for anything modern, yet quirky and isn't afraid of using a colors besides various shades of \"brown\" . 

That being said, my rating may be slightly influenced by the night as a whole rather then Hula's alone - is that allowed? Ah f*ck it, here goes. 

The first visit to Hula's was a celebratory dinner/drinks with our realtor/mortage broker after a marathon short sale that finally closed. Needless to say we were ready to drink. Too damn hot to sit outside but the patio seems to be where it's at. Started off with a double Mai Tai, it was strong and tasty. The menu has lots of veggie/vegan options and we had some sweet potato fries and wakame salad as apps, both great. One double Mai Tai down the hatch we got some edamame, now all edamame is pretty much the same everywhere I have ever gotten it but this was amazing! I should point out that this was after 1.5 STRONG double Mai Tai's but the edamame had some spices on it that really made it stand out.

For dinner I got the Jamaican Jerk tofu which was simple but very good. After reading all the negative reviews on the food I wonder if I have such an underwhelming sense for decent food or everyone else is just plain wrong - jury is still out.

At this point in the evening I realize my girlfriend who is 1/2 my weight has kept pace with me and consumed the exact same about of Mai Tai's as I have - uh oh, this could get interesting. At this point we decide to head to Vertigo (if you don't know what it is then you aren't cool enough to know). Half the group doesn't make it there or passes out in a random chair while I hijack the hosts Itunes account to get some decent music playing. The night ended with a barefoot walk to the nearest light rail station and a ride home. What's my point of telling you this story? The drinks are strong, it' a fun place to meet up, and those two combined can really make your evening. 

Oh, and they have good food, yeah i said it."}
{"text":"HIT AND MISS. MOSTLY MISS. GO FOR THE TUNA STARTER AND ORDER A DOUBLE PORTION; REAL HIT!

THE FOOD
-- tuna sashimi dish is great value, great flavors. order it.
-- coconut rum with watermelon liqueur a winner, if only the bartender would remember to add the fruit. do you need a recipe book?
-- hash with eggs arrives eggs-over-hard despite my instructions for easy
-- toasted english muffin slathered with butter, but not toasted.
-- chicken salad's chicken was bland except for the rub on the edge. boo.
-- taco plate features raw, unprepared corn tortillas. yeah, i can pull one from the bag and dump something in it too! why would i pay for that?
-- salsa too salty
-- cole slaw just not interesting, ends up a plate filler. blech.

THE DECOR
-- hip sealed concrete, bulk tiki statues everywhere, and faux Eames chairs complete the hip look, framed by Green-Apple table shades and roll-up garage-door walls.
-- designers kept the awesome hexagon street-facing window and high ceilings in the bar area. kudos.

THE REST
-- starting to develop a pet peeve for \"sauces\" delivered via ketchup squirter bottle atop my item or side dish. IT GOES UNDERNEATH THE ITEM OR NEXT TO IT! OR IMAGINE.... IN IT.
-- no reservation taken unless you've got six in your party. BOO. be ready for 30-minute wait in summer when no one's sitting outside."}
{"text":"After the husband, my friend, and I had finished at Paws in the Park with our dogs on Saturday, we headed over to Hula's to check out how pet friendly their patio was. We found a nice shaded table in the corner and it wasn't long until someone came by with waters for us and a dog bowl with water and ice for my Australian kelpie and my friend's long haired chihuahua. Awesome! 

Once we had chilled with some $2 mimosas, we ordered lunch. Holy cow, that Hula burger with cheddar was just what I needed after a long morning of playing with my pup. My friend got the side mac and cheese as her meal and was very surprised. As an avid mac and cheese girl, she said it was comparable to the one at The Capital Grille (without the lobster, obviously). Deeelish! Husband also enjoyed his Hula burger with side of mac and cheese, but mostly his Dr. Funk, despite the ladylike color. Looking at their weekday happy hour menu, I wouldn't mind coming back just for a drink and a basket of their crispy sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Hula's is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always delicious and the drinks are great too. The vibe is super chill, making it a cool place to hang out and grab some grub. The servers are always on top of their game and the prices aren't too shabby. 
I recommend the chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"Not gonna bother writing a super long and descriptive review with almost 200 reviews before me. Bottom line I liked this place, I will come back for sure! Was told multiple times that I needed to come here and finally did. Had the pork sandwich on the brunch menu and it was really good. 
The only problem I had with the place was our server was just a little weird, not rude or anything, she just would comment on things that she thought we were looking at on the menu and just kept walking by with her input, but not a big deal. And then not like this place could help it but I was really bothered by the other patrons there, the tables are close so I guess you can hear other people more than you would want to but some of these people were just real stuck up. Being at a trendy place doesn't make you super cool, so just chilax and have a good time or go home. But yeah, not like they could do anything about it, but if your thinking about going and your a snooty brat, just don't."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went Sunday early 6-5-16 afternoon... We always love coming to the hula bar but after this last visit, we will be sticking to Scottsdale location... The girl put us right in the middle on a tiny table next to a family nothing wrong with kids I have 3 but I didn't have space to put my purse down because the kid had his stuff right next to me.. Then on the other side was another couple and we were so close that it was hard for me and my husband to enjoy ourselves because it just feels like not enough space and we were so close to the 2 families that we couldn't even hear our own conversation...spacing is important it helps to promote a relaxing atmosphere and feel welcoming this made us so uncomfortable that all we had was coconut shrimp rolls which are my faves and sweet potato fries.. Food is awesome but I can't enjoy my food if I can't feel comfortable with space in a restraunt.. Me and my husband love the hula bar and we will go back it's our fave place to go and to hang out but Scottsdale is where we will be going it's a lot more spacey





Went to try out this hula bar with some friends since it's closer to home... Loved it we got the scorpion bowl and also my faves coconut shrimp rolls and sweet potato frys... It was yummy... And mixed drinks were good also :) and we brought friends to try it out and they loved it, they said food was yummy :) and they would definitely come back :) thanks again hula bar!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Hula's a couple of times since moving to the valley last year.  We really like both of the locations and look forward to being frequent visitors.  I love their unique menu.  Some favorites are the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl and the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Plate.  Also the kids meals are huge!  Drinks are lacking a little (Scorpion Bowl is disgusting) but that won't stop us from coming back!"}
{"text":"Good was delicious, staff was very friendly, but most of their dish ware is chipped and broken along the edges. They need to replace these plates, I'm assuming the quality of ceramic is not very durable for a restaurant. They need something that doesn't chip so easily. Luckily I noticed the chips on my plate and didn't cut myself with it."}
{"text":"I had an okay experience at Hula's, despite the Sunday night bartender passive agressively threatening to not serve my friend because he has his beanie over his eyes (note: I have seen said friend drunk before and this was not one of the times that warranted threats of non-service so rudely upon being seated.) My lobster bisque and pain killer was good...which I paid for and closed out in cash separately for each, $2 and $1 tip respectively.  I know this because I had exactly one $20 bill left on me and only had $2 remaining when I came home.  What ruined my experience here was my friend informing me that said bartender was claiming I never paid (even though bar tender asked, \"You're closing out with cash?\" each time) and trying to pin the tab on my friend AFTER I had left.  So unprofessional and completely his fault for attempting to charge us TWICE.  I question coming back after this incident."}
{"text":"I love this place! Vintage meets modern-ish and has a baby and it's this place.

The service is always good. Ronnie was my server tonight and he was attentive and cute without being overbearing while Juan Carlos was our server a week ago and he was very attentive and conversational.

The drinks are fabulous. They do not skimp on the booze and are reasonably priced while being tasty. 

Love the decor...very Tiki and open concept with the patio being the best with the numerous tables and fire-pit.

I'm cheating in that I've only tried a few things and am still giving this place 5 stars! The sweet potato fries are amazing...probably the best I've had. You can't really screw up bacon and an English muffin and hash browns can you?? 

I'll be back but I'm sure my review won't change."}
{"text":"I will apologize in advance to Amber W. who will undoubtedly light my house on fire after reading my dissatisfaction with her happy place, but Hula's really is a 2 1/2 star place to me. I've been several times at this point, and while I'll happily return when I'm in the mood for a fruity over-syruped *strong* cocktail, I will not however be spending my money to eat there again.

The first time I went with a small group in the springtime and we sat out on the patio which was a blast. Great ambiance. And two over their 151 packed Scorpion Bowls later, I was sufficiently blacked out. Unfortunately the blackout did not happen soon enough to make me forget the flavorless and overcooked Ahi Wontons i ordered.

Second time I went and ate was with Amber W. herself and I ordered the butterfish which was drenched in a terrible thing overbearing cream sauce. I asked for it pan-fried and apparently that is their definition of it- certainly not mine.

All in all, Hula's is a fun place to go, hang out, and have a couple cocktails and enjoy the patio when it's not 400 degrees out, but if you're going there with the hopes of being wowed by exemplary seafood, you will be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Really cool cocktails AND sweet potato fries?! Have been taking friends here for happy hour because we always have a fun time. 

The bar is lined with tiki cups of all shapes and sizes. There's even a drink that comes with a backscratcher? kinda weird. For a good time, order the volcano bowl: a multitude of rums, juices, and flaming shot of 151 in the middle, all in a giant bowl.

The really service sucks sometimes. - 1 star for that"}
{"text":"I have to tell you a story before I write this review... Initially I had nothing but bad things to about Hula's. Hula's is the ONLY reason I ever Yelped in the first place. I went there and was not impressed in the slightest on my first visit over two years ago now. The service was not the business and the food was not what I expected at all. 

Today I am most definitely humming a different tune...

Now that I know what the menus has to offer and I have a better feel for the happy hours and specials and have been here about a dozen times... I am a fan! I have had breakfast and dinner enough times to try several things on the menu and have had most of the cocktails. I love the Kona beers they keep on draft and the atmosphere is shakin! The staff is fun and friendly and always accommodating. 

Hula's you have a patron from here on out!"}
{"text":"Ok, Asian fusion has so many faces, that its always hard to rate one against the other, because they're just different.

After a bit of a night, we stopped here and had one more, and I ordered the Ahi Wasabi bowl, with wasabi cream sauce.  YUM!  The ahi was cut like stew meat, and was cooked just right-tender inside.  I couldn't eat it all, but good.  My dining companion ordered Habanero Lime Chicken Tacos, and the same result.  She couldn't finish it, so it was boxed.
We also split an order of Mac and Cheese.  Of course theirs used some variant of cheese that was just great.  Where was all of the Mac and Cheese experimentation when we were kids?

All around, good menu, yummy, and way better than any drive-thru at that time of night."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable atmosphere and staff. Had the ribs with very good sauce while not swamped on it. Great taste and seasoning. Beans and rice where pretty decent will go back in the future. The muay Thais are great with just the right combination"}
{"text":"I came to this location at around 5pm on a Sunday. I sat at the bar for around 20 mins with 6 friends and was totally ignored. No recognition what so ever. We eventually left and we're given a weird look from the hostess. I've been here several times before and have never received service as bad as today. We will take our business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"A fun eatery in uptown Phoenix!  Hula has great happy hour, dinner and brunch!  I'm a fan of the tacos and the two egg breakfast. 

I don't think I've ever been here without a group of people, so I've always had either a Scorpion or Volcano bowl.  Both are super strong and have 151 in the middle.

Bring your friends!"}
{"text":"Have happy hour every month and the bar service is slow and gives the feel like you are putting them out!

Knock it off or I will move my 300+ happy hour somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place, as I'm drawn to tiki themed establishments like a moth to light.  We went in the early evening (maybe 5:30 or 6) to partake in some happy hour specials and ordered ceviche, one of the house specials.  The ceviche we received had obviously been sitting for awhile, as the fish was mushy to the point that you would've been better off eating it with a spoon - gross.  Luckily, the waitress agreed that the batch was way off and removed it from the bill.  Coconut shrimp rolls were crispy and tasty, and we loved our mai tai and dark and stormy.  We were planning on splitting the macadamia encrusted butterfish with mango sauce, but when we tried it, my boyfriend gagged and refused to eat another bite.  I thought the flavors were a bit strange/overly sweet but would've given it more of a chance.  However, at that time, friends of ours called and invited us to join them at Pita Jungle, so we just paid and left.  

Waste of money, but now we know: come here for drinks and cooked apps and beware of the fish!"}
{"text":"This past Wednesday happened to be their 2-year anniversary and we were fortunate enough to be there for the free appetizer / drink coupon as a result.  Drinks were great -- definitely liking the laid back, tropic vibe.  Food was decent (macadamia encrusted mahi, ribs), but didn't raise the bar for food of this type.  Only downfall was service -- our appetizer never made it, and extra drink did (not complaining about that!), had to ask for our waiter on a few occasions, and the check took a lot longer than would be expected.

My bottom line:  Would love to hit this place at happy hour or late night drinks, but would probably look elsewhere if I were looking for an above-average meal."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the drink list - many of which the last time I had access to those drinks was in the Caribbean itself. I mean I've never seen a Painkiller (a drink created in the USVI/BVI area) outside of the Islands. Its pretty authentic tasting here - except the ceramic coconut! I also ordered a fish sandwich which was delicious. The pricing is right and the location is ideal in Old Town Scottsdale. Well worth the visit as its clean and designed well."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I had so much fun here . . . All while being sober as a bird! 

Met up with a group of Yelp friends for Preston S.'s Back to Drinking UYE! What an awesome idea, except I wasn't able to drink. Next one. Promise, y'all. 

So this was my first time at Hula's and I loved it! The Tiki Hut theme and décor were done nicely. Not tacky at all like I was expecting for a themed place like this. And bet that patio is amazing during the cooler months with the fire pit. 

Our group sat in the bar. Forgot our server's name, but he was quick with the waters and making sure everyone was OK. He was also awesome enough to suggest a virgin \"Hula Juice\" for me, HAH! 

And of course, he put up with our rowdy crowd with a smile! 

The Dude and I tried the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Blackened Shrimp Tacos. The rolls were perfect; not overly fried. They came with a pineapple and shredded coconut sauce. 

Wasn't too impressed with the tacos; however, I will give Hula's props for actually having a legit \"salsa roja\". Finally, someone didn't false advertise. And this wasn't even a Mexican place . . . 

A little bird also told me there's another Hula's in Santa Cruz, CA? I hope that's true! Family has a beach house out there.  

Overall, I had a great time with our group and can't wait to come back here and actually enjoy a few rum-loaded beverages! 

Looking forward to the next Back to Drinking UYE!"}
{"text":"It's kitchy, it's tiki, it's typical, the patio is right in the middle of Central Ave traffic, but something about an umbrella in my very delicious cocktail makes me a very happy girl.  I totally dug this place.  Just know what you're getting into going to a place called Hula's Modern Tiki, then enjoy some damn good pork tacos and killer mai-tais with good friends on the patio."}
{"text":"I have now been here a couple of times since my first visit. Every meal I have had has been sooo good! The cocktails and the retro tiki vibe just cannot be beat! I went for brunch once and my boyfriend ordered French toast. Literally the best I have ever had! I've even visited the Scottsdale location during a staycation at a nearby resort because I just love it so much! Oh and they have awesome specials pretty much everyday! Like all night happy hour on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Be sure to have a Mai Tai. Its so good you can't have just one!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times now since we moved back from Dallas. Food is usually very good and the service is usually good as well.  BUT tonight the service was terrible!!! Waited a very long time to be acknowledged after we sat down and when it came to check out our waitress was even worse than the start!!  In addition, the noise level was unbearable!! This place needs sound absorbers for sure!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to celebrate my birthday at Hula's a few nights ago and we had a fantastic time. It was on a Wednesday night, so they happened to have an all night happy hour on that day. We surely lucked out, so we enjoyed  $5 appetizers and discounted beverages all night. 
I love the spicy edename, but I didn't really care for the black bean burger.
My friends also ordered food which they deemed satisfactory.
I can't decide if it's overpriced or not though. I could barely finish my burger and mash (that doesn't happen very often),but paying $7 to $8 for your signature drinks seems kinda steep. Happy Hour is definitely the time to come here in order to get the discounted price.  
I do love the delightful modern kitschy decor and the friendly atmosphere.
I'd definitely come back here again and give them another try. Perhaps meet up with friends on a weekend to enjoy a brunch."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome staff amazing food and a very hip place. Menu is terrific ceviche is the best and the mai tais are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hula's! 

Hula's has such an amazing happy hour. I love their appetizers, especially the coconut shrimp rolls, potstickers, and calamari. The pulled pork sandwich is delicious as well. I'm the biggest fan of their signature cocktails. I'm not one for fruity drinks, but I really like theirs! Dr. Funk is a must-try, and I love how it's served in a Tiki glass. Blood Orange Martini is by far my favorite though. Such amazing flavors! Never have had a problem with service here. The only complaint I have would be about the size of the appetizers for the price. But that's why I stick to happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and was fortunate to get a great table on the patio. Our waiter was attentive and offered some suggestions on drinks. I sampled the Dr. Funk, Hurricane, Mai Tai, and Pain Killer (don't judge me) which were all amazing! We ordered the white fish ceviche which was not served traditionally but was still very good. I also ordered a crispy fish street taco which was a larger portion than expected and very good. After happy hour the prices go WAY up but I had a great experience, great drinks, and will be back for happy hour soon!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this place...without me!!! Food great service was so fast I couldn't believe it . The waiter was very knowledgeable.. its a hipster crowd a little different but a great  environment.I want to go back really soon.!!"}
{"text":"Ive never been much for trying new places... Mainly because Im usually disappointed.  So I stick with what I know.

Hula's was a new place and by the stars above you can imagine how my visit was.

We had put in reservations for 25 people here and while they were hesitant they happily put us outside on this large table under the misters and shade.  Perfect setting.

I don't recall the waitress name, but she did something great in the beginning.  We all would be on separate tabs and she wrote all our names down.  Some places go by where you sit and will flip out if you move. She rocked this.

We all started with many drinks and any appetizers.  Let me tell you this.. I hate sweet potato fries.  I really do.. however their sweet potato fries with their dipping sauce was to die for.  I couldn't eat enough of them.  I kept looking at my friends with this \"are you kidding me??\" face. 

Delicious

Dinner came and it was ncie to literally see everyone order something different.  If you have friends and dinner that means you have a ton of food to sample.  We did just that.  

I ordered the Ahi Wasabi Bowl on white rice with black beans.  Holy crap that was amazing.  I usually get a burger, but wanted to break my burger streak.. so I did this.  A few friends did burgers and I did sample some of them.  I couldn't believe how good they were!

The drinks were awesome, food was great and the service at this place just kicks ass all over town.

I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Best ceviche anywhere in Phoenix...not to mention they allow dogs on patio AND serve them ice cubed water....so glad I moved next door!"}
{"text":"Service is the best, with personable employees. Fab drinks and an equally fabulous and casual atmospher. You can tell the owner really cares about the community they serve.  I feel blessed to be able to call Hula's my neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"Tiki!  Tiki! 

Hula's is my happy place.  Delicious food that's fresh and flavorful.  Excellent service, and the signature drinks, Dr Funk, The Painkiller, and others are fantastic, no matter the season.  The Poke appetizer is my favorite, but everything I've at Hula's has been inspiring.  

If you're really nice, they MAY even turn on your favorite sports game in the bar just for you!  

Hula's... we love you!"}
{"text":"Everything I put in my mouth at Hula's was amazing. Started off with a blood orange margarita, tart but loved it. Then The Volcano was delivered to our party of 8. It tasted like jungle juice and served family-style. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top and sweet potato fries. I think the fries were my favorite, then the coleslaw, and the pork last. It was all tasty though. Since it was a friend's birthday, they brought their signature sundae which was heavenly. Vanilla ice cream with macadamia nuts mixed in, topped with toasted coconut and other stuff. Overall, pretty stoked with my food choices. Server was awesome until we asked to split the check. She should have asked first! Just a little 'tude but oh we'll. Definitely want to go back and try other deliciousness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and decided to sit at the bar. Jeannie loves their ice tea so that was her call and I went with the Kona wheat. The Kona has a little passion fruit in it, so you weissen purists might not be game. Have had it in bottle and draft and think I like the draft better.  We shared the fish tacos and Steve split the plate for us without a request. He seemed to be one step ahead of each request. Great guy. Tried the spicy seaweed salad. Awesome! It has some heat behind it, but it was super tasty. Only bad part of our visit is I left without getting a Mai tai!"}
{"text":"This was a fabulous dining experience. the food was very delicious. 

I ordered the Pork sandwich with sweet potato drys and macaroni salad. for an appetizer i got the coconut shrimp rolls, they were great as well. Next  time in in town I will defiantly come back! The staff was very friendly and helpful with their recommendations."}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant with Polynesian themed drinks and food. I tried a few bites of various dishes and had the hapu with lemongrass sauce. The hapu itself was tender, flaky, and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately the breading on it was charred in some areas, causing it to taste bitter. The breading was also very hard texture-wise, making it difficult to eat without giving your jaw a workout. The actual lemongrass sauce was broken when it arrived, creating an unappetizing mixture of runny liquid and coagulated yellow mass. The taste of the sauce, while initially pleasing on the first bite, became harder to eat after successive bites due to the sour flavor of it. The sides for the dish included some slightly undercooked rice and very generic, bland coleslaw.

I also tried some mahi-mahi, which also came with the same rock hard breading, and a similarly sour sauce. The actual fish was delicious though and we peeled apart the breading and pushed aside the sauce to savor the pure taste of the fish.

I also tried some ceviche, which had way too much lime juice in it, overpowering the whole dish. 

The one true highlight of the meal was trying some of the jerk chicken. It was tender, with bold, spicy flavors. 

Service was good for a busy Saturday night. Drinks were refilled as needed.

Overall, the fish dishes need more simplicity in their preparation for the true taste of the fresh, good quality fish gets muddled when it is breaded and doused in a powerfully flavored sauce. While the atmosphere is great, if you dine here just be careful of what to get since the dishes tend to be hit and miss."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and chatting with a few of my best ladies.  The blood orange martini is fantastic!  I loved the patio, it was so nice to chat and enjoy the weather with some great drinks and wonderful service.

We also had the sweet potato fries and quickly realized why all of the tables around us also had them - they're awesome!

We'll definitely be back - I'm not sure I'd love it in the summer because that patio is amazing and I just wouldn't want to sit inside but I can see it easy to be a regular from September to May!"}
{"text":"As it says right in the name, this is a MODERN spin on tiki. So don't expect palm fronds on the walls and Hawaiian shirts on the staff. Instead, you have what looks to be a converted service station with lots of concrete and clean lines, and a staff that's all tatted up and vaguely punk.

I like this place. The patio is very nice on a hot day, with misters and a cold air blowing. The interior space is nice and open, with big tables and a clean, simple decor. Again, MODERN.

The food and drink menu was great. They are all about Happy Hour here, on Sunday it runs for something like 9 hours. Do yourself a favor, and stop in here for drinks: they have all your tiki staples (Scorpion Bowl, Mai Tai, etc.). The food is good, too. I like the tacos, and their salads are huge. Also, great prices on everything.

My one issue was that service was a little \"meh\". Our hostess didn't really seem to care when we arrived, and the waiter was a little spotty on getting us our drinks. It wasn't that busy, so I don't know how they dropped that ball.

Overall, as a connoisseur of all things tiki, I thought this place was a fun twist on the theme. It does not scream \"tropical\" or \"exotic\" but they're taking the idea and giving it a new look. I think that a lot of people will appreciate the blending of island themes with the more clean modern aesthetic. Well done."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I enjoyed this location much more than the old town Scottsdale location. Great vibe in s growing area. We had cocktails \"Painkiller\" is the bomb!, the Ceviche which was great. And then salads, one w Cajun Blackened Tuna the other w Grilled Shrimp.  All very very good. One caution the Blackened Cajun Tuna is very hot so be warned. What a fun place w great stuff and great food. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant, quite modern. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The seafood is the specialty, and it is done well. Cant honestly say i was blown away by the flavors, but it does make for a nice evening all in all"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere is lively.  We had iced tea, poinsetta mimosa and two appetizers - I forget what they were called but one was fish with tortilla's and the wonton's - both were very yummie. Not a great place for being able to carry on a conversation at the dinner hour, but great place if you don't need to carry on conversations across the table."}
{"text":"I am torn on this place.  We went last Saturday night and were excited to try it. We've been watching the transformation of the old building shell and now it has turned into a very comfortable place to have a cocktail.  That being said, that's probably all I would do here.  The food was less than exciting.  

When we arrived we noticed seating on the patio was sparse.  It wasn't very busy at all, yet all the seating outside was taken and no one was sitting inside.  They seem big on the \"Community Seating\" too which I find a waste because there will no doubt be chairs unused because people won't want to sit next to others. 

I had a hamburger and it was Ok, but to be honest Mazies just up the block has a MUCH better burger.  

Our waitress was a little on the clueless side. She didn't know what was in some of the dishes. She couldn't recommend food to us.  At the end she just asked \"Do you want desert?\"  I though, Umm not really but what is it?  If you told me what it was, I might be more tempted. 

The drinks were VERY good.  Typically at restaurants they give you the watered down version of signature drinks but these really did have a good kick to them.  I had the Mai Tai and I totally recommend it!   Others at our table enjoyed their drinks as well.

{"text":"Pretty nice patio! I love that they have tons of appetizers. They could use mor
Beer on tap."}
{"text":"This is one of my top five for happy hour spots.  Food items are good and cheap.  Quality of the food, especially the fries is tremendous.  They leave the skins on the potatoes so it gives them a special flavor.  I have  never had a bad server and have eaten here many times.  The other night Cherise waited on me . I loved the cool hair color.  When I want a larger meal I order the pulled pork sandwich, which is never a disappointment.  If you haven't tried Hulas, you have missed a good time.  The Tiki bar look is the best.  They have the best Mai Tai's outside of the islands.

{"text":"Have been here a few times for brunch over the last few months.  Great ambiance and dishes...especially .like the french toast and hangover hash with a side of portuguese sausage.   Good service."}
{"text":"This place should remove the food section on yelp or online about being Hawaiian. This is not Hawaiian food. The place is cool small ambience place. Service was good and friendly. Lunch menu was ok and I wasn't intersted in it and asked if I could order off the dinner menu and was told no; not til 3:30 ( it was 230).  The food portions are good. The kalua pork is not kalua pork and the rice seems like uncle bens. 

I'm here for a wedding and gave it a try. I would come back to try some dinner options but not for lunch. 

Just not my style

{"text":"Hula's is another place that is on my bucket list and a few friends met here for dinner before seeing a show at Crescent Ballroom. We went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't too busy, which doesn't surprise me for a DTPHX restaurant on the weekend. We started off with coconut shrimp rolls and potstickers, which were very good. In hindsight we probably shouldn't have gotten them though because the entrees are HUGE. 3 of us had burgers while the other had a bowl, and 3 of us took about half of our meals home (and I had mine as a drunk midnight snack). I had the cajun burger with regular fries and a cocktail which all come in adorable Hawaiian themed glasses. The service was great and the price was on point with what we received. They definitely lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"This was the first bar we went to when we moved here. We quickly became friends with the bartenders and come here at least once a month. The atmosphere is fun, the Hawaiian look is cool, the food is good, and the happy hour is the best. They have happy hour every day and all day on wednesdays! They have delicious tropical drinks that make you feel like you're in paradise. I would recommend this place for a more casual and relaxing bar!"}
{"text":"I frequent Hula's often; I enjoy everything about it.
The five stars, I give it today are solely for Alan the new
bartender . This young kid with the cool Mohawk hairstyle
gets it. He knows he's in the hospitality business and that his
primary goal is to take care his guests. He's attentive, helpful, happy, and he genuinely appreciates your patronage. Kudos to the owners for recognizing his talents and moving him up the ranks."}
{"text":"I love Hula's!  

The first time I went I was looking for something mid-townish to meet family coming from the other direction to celebrate my dad's birthday.  I really knew nothing about it, but it sounded kind of fun and quirky - which is exactly what one wants for a memorable time.  Not at all disappointed.  Everyone loved their meal.  The atmosphere was great, the patio was amazing (we didn't get to sit there, but the \"walls\" were open so it was pretty nice!).  Overall, we had a great time.

I have been back probably about 5-6 times in the past year.  I would go more often if it were a little closer to home (not their fault).  Each time I have been satisfied with my meal, drink, and service.

I also love the \"neighborhood\" feel of this place.  I have always had very friendly servers and have had conversation several times with tables near me.  It's just a good vibe.

Favorite dishes:
Ahi Poke
Habanero Tacos
Pulled Pork anything

I also love their fish menu.  You can pick from 4-5 different types of fish, then pick the style of cooking/flavor and it comes with side dishes that compliment your choice nicely.  Have never been disappointed ordering a fish dish.

Anyway - try it!  It's fun!  And it's locally owned - not some big impersonal chain."}
{"text":"Deliciousness: 4/5
Happiness: 5/5

Hula's is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Who would have known that I would have discovered an affinity for Hawaiian (Polynesian) food in the desert?

This is definitely a place to eat outside. They have a big central fire-pit and a bar area that opens to their dining patio. Yes, it overlooks the light rail and busy central street, but the food, drink and atmosphere make you practically forget you are in the middle of a crowded city. The crowd is usually bustling with people of all ages. Very kid friendly too despite a decently heavy drinking atmosphere.

The food is great - easily some of the freshest and tastiest fish in town (made more impressive given how far we are from the ocean). I can NEVER get enough of the tuna sandwich. Johnny Cakes are a fun spin on cornbread, and I highly recommend ordering some to the table, along with fish bites. If you are a pork fan, the options are numerous. The sides (typically rice and beans or fries) are always a bit bland, but the sandwiches and main dishes are top notch. I know they have a brunch menu too, but I don't really remember it well from the one time I attended.

The drinks are the true star of the show. This is the only place I have been to where I have enjoyed a rum-based drink. They also have some tasty vodka creations. But my favorite is the Scorpion Bowl! 2-4 can share right out of the tiki-styled receptacle with fun neon-covered straws. The drink acts as a moat around a flame in the center. And people, nothing is more fun than drinking around an open flame.

Tiki's is a really fun and unique restaurant. I love it to pieces. Make sure it's on your list, especially if you enjoy a fruity and well-made mixed drink."}
{"text":"I think everytime I've gone to Hula's, I've always had disappointment, even though the fish is probably the freshest, and living on the islands for 5 years, it's the closest but not exact.

One sunday evening, I decided to take some co-workers out for dinner.  There were only about 4 tables with people, therefore, \"slow\" nite.  One co-worker brought her very hungry boyfriend who had been watching the football games all day.  He did ask if it was possible to turn on the game since there was nobody in the bar area watching the \"Hawaiian\" shows.  The waitress came back and told him the manager would not change it, of course he was pretty irked about it and was making a fuss about the fact nobody was watching Lilo and Stitch in the bar area, I have to agree, seriously Mr. Manager.  

The manager never came to the table to explain the reason, but just stared at him who is a big man, who was in fact worried his steak was going to be spit on or something, which again I have to agree, a manager that keeps looking at you with \"stink eye\" (it's a Hawaiian Pigeon term) , you have to wonder.  It's a game, who cares about hula dancers and fire tossing on a sunday night. 

Food was good, the wasbi mash potatoes were not that good this time around.  We spent over $100 easily, and never a thank you for coming to Hulas.  Again, local restaurant managers and owners, be aware, some individuals like myself try to support local businesses than chains, but with the service I've seen, may have to take you off my list of recommendations. 

I did go to a sunday brunch the eggs benidict descent and the waitress was probably the best one I've been waited on.."}
{"text":"Just tried the brunch today. I got the big breakfast sandwich it was pretty good. I would get I t again. My wife liked the bean burger but wouldn't recommend the tofu taco."}
{"text":"The website did not do this place justice! This was our first monthly foodie adventure for a handful of us who work at the same company and our significant others and friends. All of the drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts were creative and delicious! Specifically, the Painkiller cocktail was simply perfection; not too sweet with a cinnamon rim. The ceviche appetizer was to die for with a meaty yet tender fish in a well-balanced marinade. There was a tie between the pork plate with tender and savory pulled pork, and the wasabi ahi with large tender pieces of ahi, sweet peas cooked to perfection and mashed potatoes that didn't miss a beat. And for dessert, the coconut pie which won hands down for the entire group as the best coconut pie ever. Can't wait to return! Will check out the patio seating by the fire pit"}
{"text":"People are not usually impressed by coleslaw. But I love coleslaw and was happy to see it as an option. And it's fantastic! Plus a whole bowl of it with plenty to throw onto my blackened fish sandwich, which also was spicy delicious! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great mix of eclectic food. I had the jerk pork plate. The seasoning was fantastic in the rice that we came with was great to mix with the pork. Only deducting one star because the restaurant is very dark making it hard to read the menu, the parking is not great, and we waited over an hour to get a table for four. But after eating at this restaurant I can understand why they were so busy. Great restaurant in the heart of Phoenix. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great patio! 

Came with a group of friends and had the pork plate with yummy little Johnny cakes and the wasabi mashed potatoes, both were excellent."}
{"text":"Great food - everything we had off the menu was delicious, and I'm honestly not even generally a fan of this genre of cuisine. They also have a nice outdoor patio and good drinks"}
{"text":"-Never been but will now frequent.
-Service was the best I've had in a while (the server specifically)!
-Cajun burger was delicious even though was a bit to medium than what i prefer
-Pork Taco was also fancied much
-That Mac and cheese tho... could taste wayyyy too much butter... would not recommend*... seriously too much butter.

I have only one weird irrational complaint.... straws were too bright and made my head hurt?..... :/. Also was a pretty sunny day and forget my eye shields."}
{"text":"Screw you, Hula's. As if Spouse and I aren't alcoholics enough, you have to go and open one of the funnest (that's right, I say funnest) restaurants in Central Phoenix, fill the menu with phenomenal island drinks, and plop the whole thing within stumbling distance of our home. Our livers are on you, buddy.

It takes a lot to impress a professional boozer (that's a lie, but let's move on). That Mai Tai I had last night tasted better than the ones I had in Hawaii. And can I just say how refreshing it is to finally get some fruity options (because I am a huge fruit) rather than the same ol' margarita and martini variations served at every other restaurant in town. Not that I don't live for margaritas and martinis. Let's be honest, I'd drink mouthwash if the bartender poured it in a glass, mixed it with grenadine, and served it to me.

Where was I?

Oh, there's food too. Loved the sweet potato fries. Loved the Hula burger with sauteed onions. Loved, loved, loved Spouse's coconut chicken thingie. I am so ordering that next time because he refused to share. So stingy. BTW, I love that they have a Pupus menu (that's Hawaiian for appetizers) because I am a child (teehee, I said Pupus).

Speaking of next time, we're going back this weekend. Bringing a bunch of friends to hang with on Hula's groovy new patio. And I'm ordering about 17 more Mai Tais. If Hula's could go ahead and place an AA phone number on the drink menu, I'd appreciate it."}
{"text":"The greatest Key Lime Pie I have ever tasted, hands down. Phenomenal food all around."}
{"text":"Yay for happy hour deals! After several visits to this hip little rum bar on the light rail line, I've got to say I will keep coming back for the casual and welcoming patio. The food isn't exceptional, but it is good; beer selection could be better; and there are some great rum drinks. I thought the concept was well executed overall. We could use more places like this in the area."}
{"text":"We had all the appetizers...seaweed salad, shrimp, sweet potato fries..., they were all yummy and I put the funky pineapple yellow sauce on my seaweed salad and that made it taste better...its a cool place."}
{"text":"Rather than kitchy, this place had pizzaz. It has the updated 60's vib down pat. Cocktails, food and service all thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hula's is one of my favorite places to eat, get a drink, or do both
It has such a cool modern tiki design and layout that is sort of makes you feel like you're not in Phoenix
It is very well known for its lush patio but inside dining is just as great because it is so earthy and trendy
You have to try the Mai Tai's, they are fabulous
If you're feeling a bit daring, you and a friend or date should try the Scorpion Bowl
Might take a group of 3+
PS: It has Bacardi 151
I have always had pleasant encounters with the servers and waitstaff
All of them are very friendly and knowledgable on both food & drink menus
Two of my favorite foods here are
1) The Hangover Hash, it is excellent
If you are there for brunch please try the H.H, you wont regret it
2) The Polynesian Chicken Sandwich, again, it is scrumptious
Their tacos are yummy as well 

Their happy hour specials are really great too"}
{"text":"Came back to Hula's for dinner this time.  Ran into the owner who remembered me from the City Circles Light Rail Wine Walk.  

My girlfriends and I all ordered the butterfish, based off the recommendation from our friendly waitress.  It was delicious!  Try the LemonGrass or Macadamia Nut Crusted preparation.  Both are yummy!

We all licked our plates clean and couldn't stop raving about how fresh the fish was.  It practically melted in your mouth.  

Minus one star because it was freezing inside!  Bring a sweater!

A response from the owner:

\"Velika,

Great to see you! I appreciate your taking the time to give us a review, and for your business! We embrace all criticism, both good and bad, since it helps us in our constant struggle to be better. I'm glad you came back! Sorry about the temperature, but here's the problem we have: if we turn off the A/C when it's humid, the moisture in the air settles on the cold concrete floor and makes it slick as ice. I'm afraid someone will fall and really hurt themselves, so that's our dilemma. I'm so sorry that it marred your experience, and hope to make it up to you sometime soon.

Take care, Velika!

{"text":"LOVED our experience. I wish I had 10 stars to give. I hosted a surprise 40th birthday party for my boyfriend which was 2 months in the planning. We had a party of 36... yes 36 people. From the very first email to last call (yes we closed down the bar), EVERYONE at Hula's was absolutely amazing and accommodating. Kyle the manager, was ever patient with my obsessive emails and questions, Cherise was a rock star making sure everyone had what they needed without missing a beat. She was sweet and smiling all night even though I know that we had her running. The food came out exactly as requested and got rave reviews (ordered a little of everything off the appetizer menu. 
The atmosphere on the patio was the perfect mix and mingle place for our party. We cannot wait to come back and have dinner and explore the menu. My boyfriend was thrilled and everyone had a great time. Thank you for making the night complete!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time! The food is delicious, and the decor is so cute. They make good drinks, too. I highly recommend their pulled pork, and their french fries will change your life. Yay for delicious tropical goodness!"}
{"text":"We entered Hulas Modern Tiki and immediately felt the wind Leave our sails. This A Frame style building resembles a cabin more than a tiki bar.  Very sterile and no cozy island vibe.  I ordered a Mai Tai. It arrived sour and unpalatable. The waitress offered to replace it with another drink. I ordered the Tropical Itch, suggested by the bartender who said it was a sweet drink. Again, a sour drink. Perhaps a mixer/juice was bad.  We ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Abalone Style Calamari.  The calamari was good, but a bit soft from improper frying.  The coconut shrimp rolls were outstanding. We opted to skip the main course and go to dessert. We ordered the Coconut Creme Pie.  The pie was not the custard type but more of a cheesecake.  After getting a large glob of cream cheese which I had to sneak from my mouth to my napkin, we gave up and asked for our check.  The 2 stars are 1 for the shrimp rolls and 1 for our waitress.  We are leaving here disappointed and in need of a Good drink and dinner. This was a $40 lesson."}
{"text":"Love the drinks, and can't beat happy hour on Sunday and b Wednesday. The bowls and tacos are awesome and one of the few places that serves abalone. Bartenders know their stuff and never had a bad experience, staff is awesome"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my faves! I rarely get out of my side of town. Perhaps I learned a good lesson. Sometimes you have to drive farther than your backyard for some great grub! Hula's happens to be in the heart of the city and worth the drive. 
We took our dog Darwin with us on this beautiful Sunday. Had an amazing brunch and mimosas. Service was excellent and the food was absolutely delicious. Hula's is a dog friendly environment and Darwin had an enjoyable time in the patio. Great deals during brunch with $2 mimosas and $5 bloody mary's. MMmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Hulas Modern Tiki, is Arizonas modern twist to a Hawaiian fusion American themed restaurant. I dined at the Scottsdale location at first. This will be my 2nd time here at the restaurant but it was my first time at the Phoenix location! Much different but I do love the original I believe which is the Phoenix one. Located in the heart of mid-town of lovely local restaurants. Prices are decent your wallet will appreciate you, specially if you come thru happy hour! Drinks are awesome food is fantastic! I personally tried and will recommend the ceviche, the hula's original burger is fantastic, I recently tried the Yummy Polynesian Chicken Burger which is delicious I paired it with sweet potato fries and their draft IPA! Service was consistent specially since I had a big group for a birthday! Definitely looking for that new twist guys? Well stop by Hulas, fun filled adventure into the islands is a door away! Stay cool, and stay hungry Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of my favorite Phoenix eateries. Ceviche is the best in town, and the rest of the Hawaiian fare is simply delish. Fish bites are ridiculously yummy. Great beers on tap, and the service is laid back yet attentive."}
{"text":"I'm really happy that Hula's is within walking distance of my apartment.  This is because the tropical themed drinks pack a punch!  Me and my ladyfriend shared a \"Scorpion Bowl\" that was deceptively sweet.  We both stumbled home.  

Make sure to eat plenty while drinking at Hula's - there is some excellent food to help keep one's blood alcohol level in check.  The last time I was there I had Duke's Lua plate, with slow pulled pork, cole slaw (which had a subtle wasabi flavor) and sticky rice which was amazing.  The fish is of high quality as well, though the blackened Ahi Tuna burger was a bit dry .  The burgers are excellent, with the Hula Burger being exceptional.

If you want to get drunk and pretend that you are in a tropical paradise - this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The Mrs. and I relied on the other positive Yelp reviews and were not disappointed with our dinner at Hula's.  Our evening started off with a flavorful and fresh Island Style Poke appetizer.  She chose the Hawaiian Style Pork Platter, similar in texture to pulled pork, but with the flavor of the islands in the pineapple and tasty sauce. I had the Hapua, encrusted with coconut.  The fish was very light, tender, and fresh tasting.  Rice and cole slaw accompanied our main courses and the cole slaw was especially good. The service was attentive and drink refills were plentiful. This is a great place for a date night...puts you in a tropical mood. Prices are reasonable for the high quality food here.  We'd love to go back to try more of the menu items next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I lovED Hulas. I still love their drinks minus the Bloody Mary. But going here was annoying yesterday. 

My friend and I wanted a nice late lunch and a couple of drinks. We couldn't figure anything out so we made a couple of stops. First stop was St. Francis, but the wait was 40 mins. We opted to pass because we were hungry. So I suggested Hula's...because you can never go wrong with Hula's! 

We walked in and were immediately greeted by a pretty hostess who took seated us. They brought out the bunch menu. I asked for the gluten free menu. Their brunch menu ends at 2:30; well the breakfast options do. The rest of menu is very limited. Waiter came and took our drink order. The Bloody Mary wasn't good. I drank less than half of it. When the waiter came back to get our order, everything we wanted, wasn't available at that time because they were transitioning from their brunch menu to regular menu. What was the point in giving me a gluten free menu if I couldn't even get anything on it for another hour? That was irritating. And why not offer the entire menu all day like most places? Not everyone wants brunch. Anyway, We asked the server for the bill with our drinks and decided to eat elsewhere. Before bringing our check, the waiter brought us a complimentary seaweed salad which was very nice of him. 

3 stars for service; but I know your food is good too. I'll update my review when Hulas deserves it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fabulous patio, you have found the place.  Tiki has a full bar and a great indoor/outdoor atmosphere, this is a great happy hour or group kind of place.  

I agree with most on here that the food was ok.  I had the tofu with a lemon sauce and it was good, but not nearly as flavorful as others I have had at other restaurants.  

I could see this as being a place to meet for happy hour, informal meeting or just day drinking, but I wouldn't stay for dinner.  Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food, but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place have for years! - great atmosphere, great food, good drinks.   First major complaint ever is that \"Two face tattoo\" bartender is a BIG Grump!!  Simple order - 3 beers and we get high drama from this pretend cocktail God.  Poke And Wings make for a great app combo!

Came back for lunch and it was so good!!!"}
{"text":"There were so many things on this menu that I wanted to try, it was hard to narrow it down. Cajun/Hawaiian fusion will do that to you. I ended up going with the fish tacos and they were great. The Hawaiian Mac salad was pretty tasty too! We had the Cajun burger, which was also very good. Cool tiki vibe and tons of open patio seating. They also donate 10% to non profits on Mondays, which is commendable."}
{"text":"I have absolutely fallen head-over-heels in love with Hula's for so many reasons! Let's just go over a few:

-The amazing tofu tacos
-The \"I'm-gonna-fuck-you-up\" Scorpion Bowl (they light the 151 on fire!)
-The kick ass happy hour
-Outdoor seating with misters
-Sweet potato fries

This is a really laid back environment with a lot of options for veggies AND vegans, and they have really awesome drinks. Do yourself the favor and head here with a group of friends and split the scorpion bowl. You can thank me later, just be prepared to call yourself a DD."}
{"text":"It's Tiki Time. B-)

Grab cocktails left and right. Dr. Funk? Hell yeah. Mai Tai? Packs a punch every time.

Now sit on the patio and people watch in style...and if you like island food but you're not feeling adventurous, this is perfect for you. I tried the pulled pork sandwich and the jerk chicken. The jerk sauce is a bit sweet, and not nearly spicy enough for my taste. But it's still tasty. My pulled pork sandwich had an amazing slaw...the overall sweetness, and the heavily buttered bun was a bit overpowering. I don't need everything to taste like cinnamon and allspice. 

I think I'll come here for the cocktails and appetizers. Those sweet potato fries are the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Our server Keith was very friendly and checked in on us a lot!  The food was yummy - had the kalbi ribs and was one of the best I had!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in all of phoenix. 
Great food, wonderful autosphere, and amazing service. A must visit while in town."}
{"text":"Went back again today with a group.  This time I did try something different.  I had the Luau pork plate.  The pork was shredded and had chunks of pineapple throughout.  It was served with white rice and cole slaw.  I really like their cole slaw as many restaurants use vinegar in theirs and make it sour tasting.  But not here.  It is delicious.
Only complaint I have is all they serve in beer is Hawaiian.  I am an amber beer lover so I don't usually have a drink while here.  Don't they have amber beer in Hawaii?  I also wish they served dinner rolls with the dinners.  Someone at our table had cerviche which was served with large crispy won tons which I stole and used these with my pork to make up for the dinner rolls."}
{"text":"Meet with old friends on the patio last night. Even with the rain it was delightful. Our server was attentive and the happy hour bites were quite tasty.  I enjoyed on tap the longboard ale from the Maui Brewing Company, something I've only been able to do in Maui or in a bottle locally. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have to tell you....

I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Drove here with friends on a whim to check it out.  They had seen it advertised somewhere and wanted to give it a shot.

We were greeted by a guy who turned out to be our server (Ronnie) and he was the perfect blend of sarcasm and sweet that you want in a waiter when you are there for drinks with friends.

My hubby ordered the pork potstickers and he LOVED them.  I had the mac n cheese (average, but I ate it) and the sweet potato fries (yum!).  Our friends had two types of fish - couldn't tell you what but they devoured it!

We had a great night out and will definitely be back.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambience. I went on a Friday evening, so it was pretty packed. There's an option to dine inside or outside. Since it's around 100 degrees right now, they have an outdoor misting system. Diners can also sit inside at the bar. 

For appetizers, we ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls. It comes in 4 rolls for the price of $7, which is pricey for something that tastes just like eggrolls. My boyfriend had the Jerk Chicken Plate. Be prepared for a fairly generous portion of chicken. The jerk sauce was good, but became overwhelming. It was easier to finish the chicken by intermittently eating other items on the plate. My favorite was the fried sweet plantains. I ordered the Blackened Wasabi Fish Special. The fish did not taste fresh to me - it was just a satisfactory dish. Based on what I ordered, it was a little pricey for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  From Scotty to Matt to the drinks to the food.   You will not be disappointed.  Love the Zombi and the wasabi mashed potatoes.  Any and all fish dishes are excellent. Hands up to everyone.  My birthday girls were super impressed.  Thank you everything was a TEN!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Hula's
The first time we came in a noticed the spicy shrimp caesar.  I thought mango in a caesar was a pretty odd choice.  I tried it thinking that the two really didn't go together but was pleasantly surprised!  
The next trip I ordered the Jerk Pork.  Holy pig.  Seriously, this pork was melt in your mouth tender.  Chewing was hardly necessary.  The flavor was really really good.  All of the sides were delicious, the fried plantains were just right and the Jamaican johnny cakes were passed around our table for everyone to try.
Out of all the guests we have taken with us no one has ever left disappointed.  We have yet to run into anything mediocre and always look forward to our next trip."}
{"text":"First part of the review has nothing to do with the food.  They took a long vacant building in the middle of an easy-to-miss strip mall and helped transform it into a architecturally significant restaurant which in turn attracted a modern set of proprietors.  The outdoor seating within the translucent fencing is perfect for the cooler months and the oversize firepit and tiki statue set a nice island vibe.  The inside of the original building is set up to show off the giant six sided window that now shows off the light rail as well as the church across the street.  The 20+ft vaulted ceiling is impressive and that allows there to be vintage surf videos projected on the opposite wall from the window. They take requests too. Blue Hawaii with Elvis was on during our visit.  Stained concrete floors, glass tile backsplashes, and stainless steel wrapped entryways are some of the modern touches while the vast and original collection of 60s period and surf memorabilia remind you that this is an island restaurant too.  The addition on to the original structure is where the majority of the dining area and has a unique i-beam table system where you can slide table tops along the top of the beam to transform from a table for 2 to a table for 8 in a flash.  Very creative.  The last and best feature is the garage doors that open up the bar and seating areas to our beautiful climate (most of the year).  We got there around 6 when the A/C was turned on, but once the sun was down and it cooled off, the doors were all opened and patrons all cheered!  Good concept that has become more popular especially with local restaurants that are willing to be a little more adventurous with their design, like Postino's and Vig.

We sat at the bar for almost three hours which not only gave us a change to order a half dozen appetizers and an entree, but we got to talk to a rotation of different patrons that ordered drinks and appetizers.  The had a limited menu for opening night, but it seemed like enough to choose from.  There is a good selection of wine and beer, but we thought it most appropriate to go for the specialty island drinks that they've been making for years at their California tiki restaurants.  Our favorites were the Ahi Poke with seaweed, shrimp rolls, and the Wasabi Crusted Ahi with Wasabi mashed potatoes for an entree.  Everything was very fresh, tasted great, and was priced reasonably.  Bar neighbors to our left and right tried the Hula burger, pork tenderloin, dumplings and all had good reviews.  I don't think that I would ever visit Hula's without ordering the Poke Ahi appetizer though.  

I was a little skeptical on the combination of a Tiki and contemporary concept, but they comfortably coexist in a clean-lined mid-century modern way.  They're shooting for \"Houston's\" type of service and I think that they're on their way.  We're looking forward to working through the rest of the menu soon.  I'm glad to see how the Central Corridor is really livening up and there are a number of restaurants and bars to walk to from Hula's location.  Easy stop on the light rail, or what we hope will be popular is the extra large space for bicycle parking along the side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonite. We were seated right away despite it being busy.  They have a gluten free menu with lots of options and were able to accommodate our families many food allergies. The wait staff were fantastic. Our food came very quickly and was delicious. First time my two year old has finished a dish at a restaurant.   We will be back."}
{"text":"First visit to Hula today for lunch.  The Big Sur Black Bean Burger (their version of a veggie burger) was excellent, and it's true ... it's the best in town.  My son had the pork tacos and he said they were delicious.  Great place.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time with friends the other night. Lovely atmosphere although its mostly outdoor seating. Had the Ahi Caeser salad which was heavenly. Good drinks as well! A little pricey but a good time none-the-less!"}
{"text":"I've been in Phoenix for 5 nights and have had dinner here every night so far. The atmosphere is so perfect and the people both employees and patrons are always so friendly. I can't even begin to explain how good the food is. Everything is spiced so well and so different. Even something as plain as coleslaw is made awesome here. 

I've always been seated fast and had my order quick, even when it's busy. 

I would recommend this to anyone and will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is delish! It's live & trendy! Love the atmosphere! The Hawaiian ceviche is to die for! Loved it! The traditional Kabi Ribs was also amazing! We're from utah & if we ever visit Arizona again, we are definitely coming back! It's probably worth the trip alone!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with ok (the jerk pork was good, but it seemed to be missing that extra kick of cinnamon; the korean style wings and poke were very good) and probably a little overpriced food."}
{"text":"If you're unsure about your feelings of seafood, Hula's will change your life. It wasn't until I tried the Ahi Tacos that I decided fish are friends AND food. All their tacos  are one of a kind but my fave dish is their Bean Burger with regular fries and a side of Cajun aioli. Dang I'm hungry now. Also, the service is A1."}
{"text":"I've been to Hula's many times both for happy hour and dinner and the selection is great! They have a creative menu and the drinks are fun and full of flavor! The fish tacos and seaweed salad are probably our favorites. We tried the bean burger and sweet potato fries which was actually really good! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, a chill atmosphere, and great pricing. If you want to wrap up with desert they just opened up Twist next door for a great selection of frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"I should have gone here sooner. I feel like I've cheated myself of delicious food for years. I had some sort of spicy chicken bowl that I will definitely be eating again. After that I will have to get the pork plate my friend got which for the first time in my life, made me actually glad that pigs had to die for the honor of being so perfectly prepared. Our server was Kyle, he was tight. VERY WORTH IT."}
{"text":"i love this place! our waiter was great and the food was fresh. 
TRY THE PINK BIKINI"}
{"text":"Solid. Consistent. 

Hubby got the Hula burger again and was practically moaning with pleasure throughout the entire meal. 

Ceviche was good AGAIN. 

I got the Ahi burger this time, and it was scrumptious: Perfectly seasoned and a little spicy, I will definitely be getting this one again."}
{"text":"This made for a good lunch spot with a friend. I asked for the spicy Thai chicken bowl, but less rice and more cabbage. It ended up being rather like a cabbage-based salad, which was okay by me! The chicken was nice and tender, though the spiciness was rather overwhelming for me, personally. I ate it all, but it's not a dish I'd order again.

The atmosphere was very nice in there and we had great service. My friend greatly praised their happy hours, and I'd like to visit again during that time."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour and our waiter was good.. nice outside patio.. defin will come back.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to the area and just driving around and found Hula's -we are so happy we did! We had couple beers at the bar before being sat. Try the koko brown seasonal on tap, soooo delicious! One of the best beers I've had. Food was amazing! I got the short ribs and he got the jerk pork plate. We where both super happy and definitely going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"Some of my funnest, most memorable nights have started @ Hula's! Whether I go there for a lil' HH or a nice dinner (...or killer brunch!), I always have a great time. The food styling is very unique in the Midtown area...Hawaiian/Asian fusion. My favorites are the ceviche, the abalone-style calamari, and the Kona French toast for brunch. 
  My friend B. and I were on a quest for the best sweet potato fries in PHX not too long ago, and Hula's was the clear winner! Love the aioli!
  Another of the reasons I keep going back to Hula's is because of the awesome bar experience. John, the bartender, makes some of the best drinks in Midtown. In addition to Hula's mega-luau of tropical drinks, John had made me some killer \"experiments\" including a Spicy Dark-n-Stormy and an Absolut Cilantro & lime tonic. 
  Mahalo Hula!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We went on a Friday night with hardly any wait.  We got a drink and the bar and then we're seated quickly.  The edamame was SUPER spicy, don't recommend that, but everything else way delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I'm glad they opened a 2nd location in Scottsdale, but the original is way better! I love the atmosphere here-the patio space really makes it. The inside decor is unique too, and really makes you feel like you're elsewhere. The staff is always on top of service. I've never had a bad experience. The drinks are good-it's a polynesian place, so definitely a lot of Mai Tai action. I can usually only have one because they're so sweet, but luckily they have wine, beer and a full bar as well. And the food?! OH THE FOOD!! So friggin' delicious! My go-to is the Mango Chicken Ceasar, but I suggest you try something new for each visit. They're BBQ Rib Dish is delicious. And don't forget to get some sweet fried plantains! Just like mom used to make!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love that the pulled spicy chicken tacos. The food here is unique and yet delicious. Staff is very nice and friendly however they can get overwhelmed and very busy. The setting of the building there is pretty awesome. It's great and clean meat and fun. Other foods that I have tried I have been delicious as well"}
{"text":"We love this place, well I do! When we go it's because I picked the place for us. I get the black bean burger and yam fries or sweet potato fries and a delicious rum drink. The sauces are great too. We've been so many times but all I've tried is the black bean burger. Maybe I'll get wild next time and try something new."}
{"text":"I am from Santa Cruz, CA and this place is a taste of home. When my cousin, who used to be a bartender at the Santa Cruz local, told me they were opening a place in Phoenix, I was SO HAPPY!!!

My favorite things are the Poke appetizer (seriously the BEST EVER), sweet potato friends, fish cakes, and DR FUNK! I could drink Dr. Funks all day long - nothing but coconut pineapple cocktail goodness! I could swim in that stuff it tastes so good. In fact, that's what I want for my birthday - a kiddie pool filled with Dr. Funk!

On the Santa Cruz menu, they have beef satay and ahi rice bowls that are amazing - I wish they were on this menu as well.

The ambiance is more \"posh\" than the Santa Cruz restaurant. I love the outdoor patio -it may be one of the prettiest I've seen in town. 

I will go back to this place every time I miss home."}
{"text":"Hula's you've won me over.

My second visit was brimming with warm friendly service, reasonable drinks and tasty food.

The indoor/outdoor blended space here is awesome on a gorgeous Phoenix evening in February!

Until next time Hula's!"}
{"text":"Took my Gal here because of the ROTD. Cool Central Phoenix bar. Drank the Hawaii Five-0's. HH $5.  They were very refreshing. Also ordered the crab cakes $5. Three delish spicy cakes were served. 

Our server was very attentive even tho she was super busy. And the house was packed but all were happy today. 

Later in the week we came over on Good Friday. This was a super romantic evening. A full moon behind whispy clouds. Sat on the patio next  to the fire pit. It was chilly. The warmth was very welcome. Many of us were against the fire.

Ordered the Hawaiian Lobster Bisque 6. Traditional creamy lobster soup with coconut milk and a hint of siracha pepper sauce. And the Butterfish $16 Macadamia encrusted mango-papaya sauce, rice, slaw. Had the Hula's Mai Tai $7 Appleton\"s Gold Rum, Orange, Curacao, Pineapple & Lime Juice, Orgeat, Dark Rum.

What a great late nighter.

Later that year:
Spicy Thai Chicken $13. boneless chicken breast, spicy thai sauce, avocado, fried sweet plantains...Sweet Plantains!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while looking for a fun and different place to take out of town guests. Got there around 5pm on a Thursday night and our larger party was seated right away. Enjoyed some really good happy hour specials. The Mai Tais are different from what you'd regularly get, a little less sweet a little more lime flavor, but a good strong drink and I really enjoyed the flavor. We also tried the chicken sticks, chicken wings, fish bites and french fries (regular and sweet potato). All were excellent. For dinner I had the Ahi Tacos. They put so much Ahi on each one that I could only eat one and took the other home. The flavor was really good, definitely fresh Tuna and I loved the spicy salsa it came with. 

Beyond the food, the service was also excellent. We ordered different things over the course of two hours and our waitress did not seem to mind continuing to check on us. She was friendly, attentive and our food came out quick. Overall this place was a win and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Take advantage of Wednesday all day happy hour. The food and drinks are better than average and the servers are nice and appropriately attentive.

I had the shrimp eggrolls, which were a good tummy filler. ceviche, which I didn't realize that dish was supposed to be a little sour tasting, so I didn't care too much for it. shredded pork tacos - solidly good. and traditional ribs with slaw - pretty good, as well."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It was upscale Hawaiian food to die for. The mixed drinks were fantastic. You must get the painkiller."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and what doesn't sound appealing about a Hawaiian themed restaurant?  We walked in and were shocked at how packed the patio and restaurant were.  There was a very short wait that we spent checking out the awesome bar.  We sat down and I loved all the tiki men statues lining the walls.  We ordered two drinks that were both fruity and delicious, 1 of which came in an adorable tiki shaped glass.  We started things off with some delicious sweet potato fries, and I got the shrimp tacos and my friend got the macadamia crusted halibut, I tried a bite of hers and both were delicious!!!  I can't wait go back with a big group of friends so we can check out the bar a little bit more next time."}
{"text":"I realize the review page says Hula is not a place for kids but since it was 1:00, in the p.m. I figured my husb. and I could give it a try with our 3 year old and not give anyone a heart attack.  Mosly elderly folks at this time of day.  We were greeted timely enough and allowed to sit where we pleased.  Chose the booth seat against mirrored wall.  Our boy was well behaved, only a little loud happy talking here and there.  He coiored with crayons and paper that we brought.  Stayed at the table with us.  

We were not told someone will be with you in a moment by other server who tended to others for about 5 minutes.  When our server came, we ordered tea, water, a fancy juice for our boy and shrimp rolls.  

Shrimp rolls came before drinks.  They were crispy on outside but filled with imitation crab and only a few bits of shrimp.  Good sauce.

Tea and water came and then then a few minutes later the juice.  The boy enjoyed a big juice with cerrries, oranges, and an umbrella.

Husb. ordered a fish dinner with sweet potato fries, ceasar salad and mac n' cheese for our boy.  Would share.

It was a LONG time before main food finally came.  I asked about it as we all were getting antsy.  Server told us that it would be less than 5 minutes as they were waiting on the mac n' cheese.  She said sandwich (we didn't order a sandwich but we took it anyway) was ready and did we want it now, before the mac n' cheese.  Yes!

Sandwich and fries came out COLD and the salad came out warm.  All three tasty though.  Mac n' cheese came too and it was NOT hot.

All in all, maybe they didn't like that we had a 3 year old with us.  There was a group of young twentish girls giving us the eye.

Don't worry, we'll never take him there again.  Not sure if I'll even go with girlfriends for happy hour."}
{"text":"Hula's Modern Tiki is a cute little gem in the middle of Phoenix. What's not to love about a modern-with-a-touch-of-retro tiki bar? I have yet to try their food, but the drinks are delicious.The staff is friendly and the patio is a great place to kick back on a nice night. 

Overall, I would recommend Hula's Modern Tiki to couples, friends, or groups looking for a chill place to kick back under the stars."}
{"text":"Cool place, loved the patio and my favorite was the coconut shrimp! So good I'll def be going back there."}
{"text":"We love coming here on special occasions. The food is really good and the drinks are really fun!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmarks and I was excited to go for a lunch meeting. Love the indoor/outdoor seating. Perfect for the beautiful weather. Their menu was extensive so you may want to prep before you go by taking a look at it prior.

The food was tasty, the service decent and I loved the decor. I ended up taking food home because the serving was huge. It was just okay though, not an experience that blew my mind or was memorable, but I think definitely worth a visit if you've never been."}
{"text":"This place was a very nice surprise. Very nice decor with a variety of really good cocktails. The food was also really good, a little pricey but worth every bite. The service was great , the waitress was prompt and she made great suggestions on food. I will most definitely return it was a really nice little place."}
{"text":"It was my first time and as soon we went inside very nice friendly hostess and our server very nice and friendly food was great and they have best keylime pie, and good price, I will go for sure again."}
{"text":"After a chaotic and disappointing experience last month, I left a critical review and was subsequently contacted by the owner. He was genuinely interested in my concerns and committed to address my feedback. 

So we gave Hula's another chance last night and it was an entirely different and a much improved and very pleasant experience. I wanted to change things up and asked our server for a suggestion and she offered up the Kalbi ribs. Well, they were spectacular! Kudos to Dana and his team!"}
{"text":"This place scores high for a date night, great ambiance and the energy was high at the late time we were there. I went with my husband and a couple of friends and we all ordered something different. I was nursing a cold and asked for hot tea and I got to choose my tea and the server said \"I hope you don't mind, but I brought you some honey.\" Score one! I thought that was a considerate touch. 

Ok, the food... my meal was delish, I had the salmon with jerk sauce. All of the different flavors definitely kept me focused on eating and that was a welcome change. My husband had the rib eye, and He shared a piece and I felt his food was too cool. It should have been hot, especially since it was a meat dish. Our friends both had chicken dishes and one of them had the teriyaki chicken and it was a huge serving.

We'd like to go again, the decor and the vibe made it feel fun and different for a night out. Next time, we'll try a couple of drinks...

So, if you're looking for a change of pace, downtown, where the food is elevated from what you usually have...go here. Parking is tough and it was packed but I think worth it! Fun!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe.. Went for apps and beverages! I highly recommend the Abalone Style Calamari.. I'd come back for that plate alone!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie I always get the shrimp tacos because they are AMAZING. The shrimp is full of flavor. My girlfriend got a painkiller cocktail that was very tasty. Hula's is a great place to stop before taking the light rail downtown for the evening. The atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Hulu's is such a fun place to eat.  Their entrees are original and tasty though lately I can't seem to get past the Fish Sandwich.  It's soooo delicious.  Mild blacked Napu on a delicious bun.  The slaw is a great accompaniment though sometimes I'll go for the sweet potato fries.  I've enjoyed brunch a couple of times as well.  The servers are friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Hula's is vibrant and lovely! It's most def a modern take on retro tiki. And they have two dollar mimosas for weekend brunch, y'all! 

That's all you need to know about brunch, which is a good thing considering it's pretty bland. We tried the Island Eggs Benedict ($10, with the kielbasa) and the Hula's Hangover Hash ($9). The eggs benedict were done very well, but nothing really sets this dish apart from one you could get anywhere else, even with the atypical meat choices. 

It was the Hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. The hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others, and the pulled pork was a mass of dry, bland shredded meat. To top it off, the eggs were done over hard with no runny yolk goodness. Suck.

Probably will not return for brunch, but mimosas and tacos may be in my future! The Tiki Time happy hour also shows promise."}
{"text":"Incredible! if your ever here ask for John the bartender or cross your fingers and hope he just happens to be working when your there! the food is good and the drinks are brilliant!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night. Had to wait about 30 min for our table but it wasn't too bad waiting at the bar 

Our servers were very attentive and the appetizers and drinks were all amazing!

We'll definitely be stopping here again when we're in town next!"}
{"text":"I love this place...the food is always great! I am greeted by the owner when I come in and usually have a great wait staff! Thanks Tia for always making my experience a great one..."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at Hula's.  I absolutely love the concept, especially being in love with Maui this restaurant takes me back to those vacations!  I highly recommend getting the Cajun Ahi Caesar.  The right amount of spice with hefty chunks of ahi tuna.  It was so amazing my mouth is watering right now!  Served on a bed of white rice and Caesar salad!  

The cocktails here are so delicious.  Do not be fooled by the modest description of any of their specialty drinks, all of them are worth every penny.  The drink we ordered this night was the Scorpion or \"Volcano Bowl\", and it is nothing to play with.  First off, it comes to you set on fire and if you dare to drink what is ignited, your throat might just lock up because its a shot of 151.  The stories I have had with 151 is for another day but just know that the scorpion is for two people.  If you're caught drinking this alone, you will more than likely be looked at as an alcoholic!  

All in all I love Hula's, it's my second time at this location and I look forward to visiting their Scottsdale location.  Definitely come with friends/family, large groups are welcome!"}
{"text":"In two visits to Hula's, I feel it is a strong two star establishment and there are several reasons why I feel this way.

Food quality seemed good, but menu items I tried were fairly bland and not very interesting, though I do find this holds true at many \"hawaiian\" restaurants. Drinks here are stiff and during happy hour you can pick up a nice buzz for very little money, and this is a plus. The restaurant is nicely designed and modern feeling, hence the name Modern Tiki. 

Televisions here, I'm assuming, are reserved for 50 year old batman movies, cartoons, and Hawaiian videos, since that's the only thing I've seen on the screens. I never understand movies in a bar with no sound, they don't make very good background ambiance as they are designed to be heard and draw you in. If sports were on, it would be great because you can glance up every now and then between conversations and see whats going on. You don't have to watch a whole plot unfold. 

My last visit, after a day of mountain biking with a friend on Squaw Peak, we stopped here for happy hour and sat on the patio. They turned on the fire pit for us and even though we were seated next to it, it provided little warmth. The fire pit did however overwhelm us with the odor of propane burning. Oh well. We asked to split the bill, mine card and my friend's cash. We handed the it to the waitress and I said \"put the remainder on the card\" yet she came back with two separated checks... both charged to MY CREDIT CARD. I asked why I would want the bill split up on my card and where the cash went. She said she thought it was a tip ($13 when the bill was $22) and I said no, you were supposed to take the cash off, then put the rest on the card. Please refund my card the amount of my friend's meal, and apply his cash toward that. She argued thats not right and refunded both meals on my card, took the cash, and said we were good to go. I signed the bill but I wonder if I was ever charged. She was doing her business a disservice with her awful, awful, serving skills.

On another visit, the bartender spent my entire time there acting like he was too cool to be at work, I was bothering him by making him do his job, and I wasn't welcome to sit there.

This could be a nice spot if they cleaned up the service problems and added a little oomph to the food. For now, I say it's a pretty restaurant with good stiff drinks. Service and friendliness is half the battle though. Unhappy/dumb as rocks staff = unhappy customers."}
{"text":"It's always fun coming to this place when the weather cools down and it's nice out.  I haven't gotten much in terms of food here besides the shrimp appetizers and the blackened fish sandwich.  However, I gotta say both of them were pretty darn good, and the sweet potato fries were better than even Arcadia Tavern's sweet potato tots! 

Service was great on a Saturday evening, and the water was always topped off (good for the ladies in our group since we had scorpion bowls!).  Since I only seem to come here to grub and go out, I'll have to go back again to try some more things; but the few times I've been here it's always been a blast."}
{"text":"Service was only ok. We waited for drinks and to order. And it wasn't even a busy night.

Food was good but we were over charged. (They said they would honor the Yelp check-in discount and then failed to do so - even after I reminded them.)

With so many fresh, hip places to eat in the area - you would think they would try to woo folks more. Perhaps it was simply a bad night. Unfortunately I'll never know."}
{"text":"Since visiting Hawaii this past spring, I've been intrigued by all things Hawaiian off the island.  (Aloha Spirit!)  So when I heard this place had opened in Central Phoenix, I wanted to check it out.  Michelle A. joined me for some island fare.

The inside is super cute with some retro surf and tiki designs and our server was very sweet.  Now despite my love for Hawaiian stuff, I am not a big fan of fish (not on a plate nor in a bowl), which is a huge part of Hawaiian cuisine.  I was happy to see burgers and a pulled pork sandwich on the menu for us non-fisheaters.  I chose the pulled pork since I wanted to see if it lived up to the description of \"heaven on a bun.\"  'Twas delicious.

Michelle and I also tried out the mai tais, which were quite tasty although a bit on the pricy side.  I can't be certain if it was the drink or the medicine I was taking that shouldn't be mixed with alcohol (whoops!), but wow was I glad that she had driven.

At the end of the night we each received a little mermaid figure to take with us.  A lovely little reminder of a pretty tasty Hawaiian meal."}
{"text":"This is still one of our favorite restaurants.  Thus far I have taken my parents, friends from out of town, book club, my husband/son and just last night I took my brother and his friend from out of town who was able to just pop up to our neck of the woods by taking light rail!

I am always impressed with the professional way this bar is run and the fabulous food and the open air environment.  I love the poke, the fish cakes, the french fries, and I nearly always get the spicy shrimp caesar.

I highly recommend this restaurant STILL and I am delighted to say they are still open and doing a brisk business every time we go in."}
{"text":"So the drinks are ok and the food is fine and it's conveniently located and the service is good.

So what doesn't work about this place?

The very notion of postmodern clear-surfaced restraint applied to the inherent and necessary tackiness of a tiki bar. That's what doesn't work.

Tiki bars aren't places you see profiled in Modern Architecture. They are the bottom of the barrel of grandiose American bourgeois self-indulgence. Yeah, and the drinks should be exotic and strong. That goes without saying. But you can have a Zombie or a Dr. Funk of Tahiti in any Hilton. You go to a tiki bar to remind yourself of how tacky previous generations were in their attempts to stretch beyond the blandness of plaid polyester slacks from JC Penney and Oldsmobile 88's without leaving Des Moines.  

To appreciate the tiki bar today we must approach with irony. However, Hula represents an irony in itself: A contradiction that is unresolved and leaves one asking \"why?\""}
{"text":"Been here a couple times with co-workers and every-time has been a good experience. Only bad thing about this place is the horrible parking.

This place is pretty clean, has friendly & fast service, and good food.  Top all this off with good company and it's a perfect experience. All my co-workers were happy with the place as well and nobody had to take any leftovers home. 

Overall a great little place, I'll be glad to come back again."}
{"text":"We Love Hula's! Our purpose is to visit every Tiki restaurant and bar in every city! All the Trader Vic's,( we have Hala Kahiki in our home state), Mister Tiki, Bali Hai, Kon Tiki, Mai Kai and plenty of others. We know TIki!!  We know Mai Tais and We know Great Food!  Hula's has it all!   We loved the atmosphere, the MunkTiki mugs everywhere. We appreciated every element of the place. (Especially Gilligan's Island projected on the wall above the bar!) The owner Chris impressed us with his hospitality and knowledge of the Tiki World. We were only in Phoenix for 3 days and we went there twice!! After having mediocre $10 Mai Tai's at Trader Vic's Scottsdale, we were quite pleased to sit on the patio next to the fire pit and enjoy $7 mai tais that actually tasted like they should. We tried every damn drink on the menu!!  So then it was time to eat! Calamari was fantastic, Coconut Shrimp Rolls were the \"bomb\" and Ahi Tuna Wontons rocked our palates!! Island Poke and Spicy Seaweed Salad were great too! No, we didnt eat this all in one night! We told you we went there two nights in a row!! :)  Great Cocktails!! Great Food!! Great Service!! You've gotta try it!!  We will be Back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A really fun place to go hang out and have a few drinks. I went last night with some friends and we had a blast! It is really cool inside since it is a Tiki hut! The food was really good: I had some potstickers, macaroni, and chicken wings with plenty to go around and great to share. Also the sweet potato fries are really good too. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Since I'm a big fan of The Torch Theatre, I often frequent Hula's before shows to grab dinner and a drink. I love that the atmosphere is so laid back, with a beautiful outdoor patio and fire pit. There's typically no wait when it's just my husband and I, even on weekend evenings. The hostess always seats us promptly. The drink menu is extensive and the menu very diverse. My favorites are the panko-crusted fish bites and their sweet potato fries...well, maybe the sauce that comes with them too.

While all my experiences have been good, I do want to focus on one extraordinary act of service I had last month. I was hosting 15 individuals for a work conference and wanted to take them to a show at Torch. I called Hula's the day before and they told me they couldn't host us all at one table as all the reservations had been booked, but they could do a few tables outside. I didn't mind, as long as we could eat there.

Unfortunately nothing ever goes as planned with that amount of people, and so we all showed up at different times, with the majority of us 10 minutes late. Not only did Hula's honor our reservation, but they had managed to put us all at one long table.

Being late, we only had about an hour to drink, order and eat before the show. The server, whose name escapes me, was blessedly patient. We ordered and were served with 20 minutes -- all 15 people. All our orders were correct and timely. I've never seen that happen with a large group ever. I was incredibly impressed and will have no qualms about bringing a large party to Hula's in the future."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome breakfast, rock solid service, and an amazing building design. This is a winner that is here to stay! I liked everything about this place from the moment I stepped through the door. Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"I came back yet again with different friends (I am determined to force all of my friends to eat here atleast once!).
My favorite server in the world Tia was there, however we were in a bit of a hurry to make our movie on time, I didn't see her AND there was limited seating as it was kid of busy, we just sat where the friendly hostess told us to.
Our new server was almost as perfect as Tia. I hadn't been here in about four months and I was quite impressed that Tia was there and recognized and came over and talked to us.
I peeked at the lunch menu and there was an item in there that wasn't on the regular menu. And of course that's what I wanted. I asked our server if instead of the Cajun Ahi Caesar Salad, if I could have the Cajun Shrimp Caesar  salad. She (and the kitchen staff) were very accommodating.
I was once again a very happy camper."}
{"text":"Love the Mongolian beef bowl, one of my go too meals when eating at the restaurant. The atmosphere was nice and a great place for friends to eat and have a few drinks. I like this location better because there is more seating, and a more appealing view especially of the city than the one in old Scottsdale but both locations are nice. Will be back to the central location soon!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry, Hula's will not let you down.  I have wanted to try Hula's for a long time and I am so happy that Groupon offered a deal.  I took my mom for brunch when she was in town.  Very friendly staff and I love the retro look of the place.  The best part....they have Sweet Potato Fries!!!  

I decided on The Big Breakfast Sandwich.  Big is an understatement!  This sandwich is huge!  A big helping of scrambled eggs, some bacon and tomato, what else could you ask for.  An awesome breakfast sandwich that went great with my mimosa!

My mom went with the Polynesian Chicken Sandwich which was also fabulous.  Just the right about of teriyaki and pineapple piled on grilled chicken.  The pesto sauce was a great touch.  My roommate who is in love with sweet potato fries order a basket along with Island Eggs Benedict.  

I will be going back to Hula's soon especially with the All-Day Drink Specials on Saturday and Sunday!"}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from a friend and decided to take a co-worker who is relocating to another office out of town.  And I am glad I chose this place.

The service was a little slow out of the gate, hence the 4 star rating, but got better as the meal progressed.  I order a fresh brewed Iced Tea . . . it was fresh, clear, with a hint of island fruits.  For my lunch I ordered the Calamari Sandwich with the Hawaiian Mac and Cheese for my side.  The sandwich was perfect . . . the calamari was grilled perfectly and the sauce and greens were just right . . . while the Hawaiian Mac and Cheese was good . . . I would have loved to see a little more pineapple to give a litter sweeter taste.

Overall a very enjoyable lunch . . . the only bad part was that I will now only be communicating with my co-worker over the internet . . . but because of this . . . I found another nice restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Super comfortable for locals. Definitely drop in if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Hula's seems pretty hyped.

I had drinks here that were OK.

I had food here that was OK.

I'll try it again and get an entree, but I'll not likely go out of my way to make it here."}
{"text":"*************      REVISION *************

Its been several months since I have been here.  Dana (owner) reached out to me, which I greatly appreciated.  I came back this past week and was pleasantly surprised, it was as though they were expecting me, its like everything was done right.  From the moment I was seated (right away) to the order and refills.  The last time I was there they must have had a bad day (or me), I had the same server and bus boy both of which were fantastic, kinda meh the last time I was here.   I'm glad to see that they are improving service.  



Done with this place.  Ugh, I hate to say it but every time I come here wether its a weekend, weeknight, weekday, weekend mid-day, its always a cluster. Largely due to lack of training and communication between the staff and host. 

I had a typical HULAs experience this past week. Loooooong story short, check in, tables were full so we opted to wait at the bar.  30 minutes had lapsed, I noticed tables were empty.  I waltz over to the host stand and the host was taking a phone order.  3 people stroll in, a server grabs them and seat them immediately. WTF!? If the server had waited for the host she would have known there was a list.  Anyways after she is off the phone we get seated.  Here is what really sucks, the party of 3 that sat before us (who was not waiting) and another couple who was seated AFTER us not only got water, but their menus before us. Again, WTF!?   I have to get up to ask someone to bring us water, at this point the hostess  turns bitch on me like I was asking for her firstborn. This has been my experience every time I go here.  OVER this place! 

The food is good, service in terms of timeliness is the worst I have experienced in PHX.  I expect this kind of service from Denny's or IHOP, not a place thar sells $13 burgers.  Im just gonna skip Hulas until they get their act together."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken skewers! Drinks I've tried on menu are too sweet to taist for me, gf loves them. I stick to the \"Tiki Bastard\""}
{"text":"Being familiar with the 90's tiki bar trend of tired, low-grade pseudo-Polynesian food, coupled with overpowered rum drinks, I approached the family's suggestion to try Hula's with some hesitation.  Much to my surprise, Hula's is quite different than the prior-century icon.

In a warm and inviting Old Town storefront, Hula's dim lighting, ample space and large central bar immediately brought to mind a comfortable dining and drinking environment.  Jazmine, our waitress, was patient, quite informative and quick to deliver our order.

We ordered a shared portion of the whitefish cerviche appetizer, and it was good.  The marinating of the fish in lime juice appeared to have been rushed, as neither fully tenderized fish nor a fully developed flavor profile were the result.  Next, we each ordered entrees and generously sampled from each plate.

The macadamia-crusted ahi, served medium rare, was very good.  A large cut of quality ahi in a nicely seasoned crust preserved the subtle balance of flavors between the two.  The luau-style pulled pork was tasty, if a bit sweet for my tastes.  Laced with a small dice of pineapple and pineapple juice, it remained satisfying none the less.  A scoop of jasmine rice helped to balance the flavors.  The star of the evening, however, was our older son's jerk pork.  Shredded, with a pleasant heat and light curry flavor, the dish was identifiable from its Caribbean origins, yet uniquely Hawaiian.

Portions are very large, and quite fortunately, the food was delicious enough to make this \"a good thing.\"

Hula's Modern Tiki is a clever concept which, as the crowded dining room will attest, serves very good food.  Dinner for the four of us, pre-tip, was $75.50, making Hula's an outstanding value as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a local brew and fantastic fish ceviche followed by shrimp and chicken taco. The food was fresh and well presented. The bar staff was very friendly and engaging and gave me advice on the best bar to watch a football game . The decor speaks Hawaiian complemented by text mex flavours on the menu. The outdoor dining area is large and open to the bar. I liked it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times this past year and am never disappointed when I go.  Be it for lunch, happy hour, dinner or take out.  I always find something delicious to try on the menu.  This little gem offers a unique twist blending island style foods with traditional American cuisine.  This is an awesome place to hang out with friends. 
The atmosphere is fun and inviting from the moment you walk in. The patio seating is great for larger groups or intimate encounters. The service is always friendly and fun. The servers are always knowledgable and offer great recommendations. They offer interesting specialty cocktails and some come in unique tiki style glasses like the zombie."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, fun atmosphere, and fantastic drinks! The ceviche was extremely delish - would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant concept is top notch. Layout & flow are awesome. The garage doors which open up the dining room are really cool. 

The food was insanely fresh & good. Ceviche was perfect. Loved the crunch shrimp roles with Pineapple remoulade.

Loco Moco was on point. Because the hamburger pattie is flame grilled & the mushroom gravy is well balanced, the entree felt light & decadent. 

Only tried the Hurricane cocktail, but would certainly order again. 

BIG FAN"}
{"text":"I came back and it was awesome. There was room inside looking towards the outside and it was really nice. My server Andrew was nice and stayed on top on refills. I am glad I came back."}
{"text":"New. Hip. Fun. The food is very good, flavorful and interesting. Cocktails match the theme nicely and are well constructed. Wine list is a bit below average, but probably a good edit for the audience. The remodel on this old eyesore of a building is nothing short of fantastic and the mid-century-inspired decor is expensive and cool. The ample outdoor seating will bring much needed buzz to the Central / midtown area. And parking should continue to be a breeze.

Now the restaurant is new, so we have to be a bit understanding while the staff gets up to speed and the logistics get worked out. For instance, with only a few wines on the wine list - the staff really should be able to recommend something. \"I've not tried any of the wines\" isn't going to help instill confidence in the menu. And we couldn't sit on the patio at 8:30pm on a Saturday (with 3 open tables) because the waiter for that section was going home. Huh? We hung around and asked a few mintues later and were seated on the patio - evidently the tables did open up after all. Not sure what that was all about...

But the menu is creative and fun. The blackened Ahi Tuna with wasabi mash and salad was most excellent - even with the silly Sara Lee-style sauce application. Ceviche was prefect. Cocktails were nice as well. 

Like other Phoenix area veterans of hip and social restaurant/bars (Postino, AZ88, Kona Grill, Bomberos), Hulas, with it's wonderful mid-town location, will be a hit as much or more for their crowd as their food."}
{"text":"What a cute, and yummy place this is! I was in the mood for Tiki / Islandy something and found this restaurant on Yelp. OMG go figure. What a delightful little find. We started with 2 Lilikoi margaritas which have passion fruit in them. This margarita is in my top 3 ever favorite margaritas. I give that margarita 10 limes for its balanced yumminess. My mouth waters now  just typing this. Moving on-we went for lunch, and while we didn't wait long for a table, once we were at the table, it took quite awhile to get our drinks ordered, and place our food order. That said, after that initial snafu all went well.
    We started with some Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls-they were gone about as fast as they were delivered. They were so tasty with a delightful pineapple-horseradish dipping sauce. The two orders from there were The Modern Tiki Fish sandwich, and The Cajun burger. Both were so good. Both orders were so tasty and good!!!"}
{"text":"Hula's was ok.  Some good, some bad.

We started with a couple specialty cocktails.  My wife ordered some martini thing with WAY too much sugar.  I ordered something with gin, bourbon, marischino liqeur, and ginger beer - it was very good.

As an appetizer we had the white fish ceviche.  We didn't like it, and even left some uneaten.  I can't put my finger on what I didn't like, but it was tart and bland at the same time.  Maybe it was just the big chunks of probably-not-fresh fish.

I like how they set up their seafood portion of the menu - 6 fish, 6 different preparations.  I can't remember the fish we ordered, but I do remember it was macadamia nut crusted.  It was almost good.  BUT, a watery relish was on top of it, so half of the fish didn't hav the crunch we like - it was just soggy.  We also ordered outside our comfort zone, and tried the black bean burger.  It was surprisingly good. Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, with sauteed onions and mushrooms on top.

Some bad, some good = 3 stars."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour on a Wednesday after a long day to watch a Suns game with a friend and had a nice relaxing time. I love that they have Kona beers, especially because not many places have the Koko brown on tap which is just too delicious to not try if you're a fan of coconut and beer. I also had an order of Tofu tacos that were perfect for a light meal and not lacking on taste. I'll definitely be back since it's in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Aloha, Welcome, Greetings, Salutations and Warm Wishes from Waikiki, Arizona!

In my search for German food to \"impress\" my play-date, I found Hula's Modern Tiki. Yeah, I know, but I already promised schnitzel wishes and caviar dreams, but time was running short to find a decent one in the area. When that fell through, I asked and she accepted food from that exotic and expensive island.

A TON of reviews praised this place and the pictures someone took were fantastic. Not to mention we were headed down the street to Amsterdam's for martinis following, so I was game. (Side note, since we were both drinking, a long walk to Charlie's substituted where I could continue being giddy and she could sober up to drive home.)

WOW, Hula's Modern Tiki was FANTASTIC! In every aspect: cleanliness, excellent staff, ambiance, location and tasty Hawaiian themed food - but who am I to judge? The last time I was in Hawaii, I ate at Ruth Chris, Dave & Busters and Planet Hollywood. 

We ordered the basket of sweet potato fries, which she liked more than I did. I didn't have a problem, but they helped soak up the alcohol I had from the Painkiller I heard someone recommend on Yelp.  And that was, in fact a very good drink.

I had the Hapu blackened wasabi fish special that came with spinach, onions and so-so mashed potatoes. The fish was, as expected hot, but very good. She had, oh, who knows, I was on my third drink when I finally looked over after saying a silent prayer of thanks that I was driving.

The wonderful waitress, Ginger (who reminded me of Elizabeth Berkley - and I'm referring to the \"Showgirls\" Berkley, which is a compliment) also recommended a Mai Tai - and I must say: I DID NOT like it, so my play-date exchanged with me her Painkiller she had ordered after tasting my first one. It may be, in fact, a good drink and perhaps it didn't mesh well with the fish, but I just didn't like it. This is coming from a non-drink critic, for if I were, I doubt most my mornings wouldn't end up like woodpeckers prefer my head to the tree out back.

Apparently they have \"garage door\" walls that open to a rather large seating area outside during the two months of good weather in Phoenix, so I MUST come back when I can enjoy the outside. 

The place is very nicely laid out, and is HIGHLY recommended for anyone to come and check it out. My only regret is that I only go downtown, or near it, once every couple months and me and my life-non-partner love to try new places. It would be a shame if I can't come back there soon. Oh, and to the real Hawaii, as well. Hint, hint..."}
{"text":"We love it here.  The atmosphere is great, it's friendly and fair priced.  The drinks are strong and the service fast.  Close to The Lex and Elevation apts for a short walk."}
{"text":"Arrived in Phoenix early Friday evening and after I had seen Ina ( The Barefoot Contessa) eat some fish tacos I knew I wanted some too. My cousin had told me about this recently opened place that he had only tried once before and said it should be a great choice for Polynesian food. I got the grilled fish tacos which were good good all except for the sides. They ran out of rice ( at least that was what I was told) so I asked for coleslaw  and then the black beans were still kind of hard. My cousin had the pulled pork with coleslaw and rice on the side and that was  good too. Overall my meal was ok and the atmosphere was nice. I admired the misting system especially because Phoenix is so hot. I may try it again on my next visit just to see if they improve."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fun atmosphere for a night out. Our server had too much attitude and that ruined the experience. Because of food allergies I had a few questions and it took her too long to come back I answer my questions (and she was passing our table frequently so it wasn't like she was talking to the chef). After getting frustrated I tried to wave her down and she started getting rude with us."}
{"text":"Go big or go home! This review will be short and sweet, just like Hula's drinks, because I always go to Hula's for one reason- their $15 Scorpion Bowl! What can I say, it's a bang for your buck with tons of rum and brandy and even fire in the middle of their signature green bowls and neon long straws that I absolutely adore! I came here to celebrate finishing my MBA. I came here when I had a rough day. I came here when I landed in Phoenix after a long vacation and needed a welcome home drink. Hula's is the best place to drink festively and so be it, it is my go to celebration spot and should be everyone else's, too! 
Also, tip: during Happy Hour come ready to spend some Lincolns because you can get a ton of apps and cocktails at $5 a piece. On Wednesdays the HH extends for drinks for all night! Cheers all!"}
{"text":"This review is more of a 3.5 star one, but I round down as a general rule.

We hit up Hula's tonight for dinner. All in all, some good-sized portions (I had the half rack of ribs), decent sides, and very good service.

My ribs were a bit pedestrian: it said mango BBQ, but it was basically just... BBQ sauce. Nothing wrong with that, but nothing amazing going on here either. The ribs were cooked well enough, coated in sauce (I enjoy both dry and sauce-drenched, so no big issue here) and they were just fine. They just weren't anything too special. 

The sweet potato fries were dead-on, and the aioli, while it could've used just a bit more kick and a bit less mayonnaise, was a good touch.

The mac 'n cheese was a big disappointment to me. The noodles were over-salted, almost as if they had salted the water entirely too much, and it just had nothing special going for it.

Mac 'n cheese is a tricky beast: you have to convince the eater that this is worth the calories and shame, and this one failed desperately in that regard. Not enough flavor and yet, too salty. A good sized portion for $5, though.

The girl had a pulled pork sandwich which was tasty enough, and she really enjoyed her side house salad. (It was tasty. I tried a bite.)

Our friend had the Hula Burger and it looked big and cooked nicely, and she seemed pleased.

Overall, a decent meal. The service was very good, the ambiance was fun and open, and it was definitely serviceable. I'd like to go back and try one of their fish options in the future, since they had a good selection of mix-and-match fish and prep styles that sounded really fun."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I never wrote a review for Hula's..... Well, better late than never!
Hula's has yummy food and a yummy vibe.  The interior is fun and feels contemporary island.  There's a large patio for those mild nights and wintertime.
The best thing about Hula is their Caesar salads.  Most of the entrees have an option for Caesar salad or sweet potato fries or something else.  Please get the Caesar salad.  If you must, then go with the sweet potato fries.  Or, you can do like my friend and I, and split a chicken Caesar salad and black bean burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  Not only will the kitchen split everything for you, you get the best of everything.  
On the last visit, we had the two entrees and four vodka cocktails and our bill was about $55.  I'd say that's a smoking deal.  
It's right off of the light rail and I hear they have an amazing brunch.  I can't wait to get up early enough on the weekend to try it!"}
{"text":"Hula's is bringing a needed island flare to the valle of the sun.  The staff are incredible, the architecture and layout is amazing and then the food and drinks.  Oh man.  Start off with a Pink Bikini or a Painkiller to get you going.  They are perfect.  Every time I drink the painkillers it brings me back to Jost van Dyke where the drink was invented - the Soggy Dollar Bar.

Then on to food.  From incredible barbecued pork tacos to juicy burgers and even vegetarian fare you will not be disappointed with the menu here.  Try the sweet potato fries at the bar while watching old Gilligan's Island re-runs on the plasma TV.  It's always a treat to go and very close to the light rail.  Phoenix could use more restaurants like this, bringing good friends together for casual dining."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The ribs were great and the lobster bisque was too.  The service was super slow, but our waitress was sweet.  Cool atmosphere, wish it had more of a \"Hawaiian\" theme.  Got in super fast.  Great location!"}
{"text":"Good food, good cocktails! Try the pineapple wine too... amazing! Service was friendly and we were allowed to loiter long after our meal was finished without feeling rushed. Great place for happy hour or a casual meal after work or on the weekend. I was impressed!"}
{"text":"Prior to this, I'd only been to the Hula's in Scottsdale and I have to say, I actually prefer the location and atmosphere of the Phoenix Hula's! I stopped in here just for a drink - heartbreaking, considering how much I love the food at Hula's - but as always, their drinks were on point. Four of us split the Scorpion Bowl and it was a decent size to split between the four of us. Our waiter only came around once to check up on us, though to be fair we did only have drinks. Love this place!"}
{"text":"'Meh...I've Experienced Better'

That is the perfect way to describe my experience at Hula. After reading the other reviews, I had the distinct impression that Hula was the kind of place that screws stuff up but is very nice about apologizing for it. That is exactly what happened to us.

I went to Hula after work on Friday with a couple of friends. I wasn't feeling too adventurous or particularly hungry, so I ordered the green salad. What I got was a soaked bowl of lettuce mix peppered with chinese buffet-style wontons. Yuck. My friend pointed out that he has an egg allergy, but the server brought out a dish with cole slaw, then took it back after he pointed out that cole slaw contains egg. The server then brought out the same dish without cole slaw, but with aioli. After pointing out that aioli contains eggs as well, the server finally brought out the dish without eggs. She was very apologetic, but it just validated the experiences of everyone else on Yelp....they work hard to correct things, but they should just get it right in the first place.

I do give them full props for the remodel of the space though, the building is beautiful."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and it is either a hit or miss. Happy hour is about the only reason I would go here anymore. Fish cakes and pork tacos are delicious. But I have had more things that I have been disappointed in with this restaurant. Also, their service is hit or miss; I have had some of the worst service of my entire life at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends from work went to Hula for our team's Xmas gathering. It was out first time for everyone and we were very impressed. We went b/c we heard about the great HH special they do on Wednesday's. HH prices on apps and drinks till 11pm. The patio outfront looks great, cant wait to chill out there once it warms up! We sat inthe main dining area. The decor was great, old retro pics cover the walls and great tiki mugs on another. We all order our drinks and numerous app's to try everything. The food was great, very flavorful, good spice and it came out hot. I would suggest the Hawaiian Ceviche, crispy coconut shrimp rolls and the Fish cakes for apps, they were soooo good. For my cocktail I would highly suggest the Tiki Bastard, has Bourbon, Gin, Ginger Beer, lime and maraschino liquid. Not one complaint on any of it. The HH prices on all app's and drinks was a great deal. I can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Well we were standing outside the doors 10mins before they first opened...that's how excited we were for this place. After watching for months, we finally have a new restaurant in town with a little more attitude than Parlor or StFrancis. Hula's is aiming at the kick back & relax crowd which fits me specifically. Good food is only good if I can pair it with a great drink & Hula's doesn't disappoint. Really, this place is great.
To begin, the renovation is wonderful. On par with the other CenPho restoration projects of the past year - this one stands out by creating a period piece instead of going for a more modern style. There's a fire pit & plenty of outdoor seating along with a wonderfully decorated interior - all separated by some moving glass garage doors (like Postino). The best piece is their sliding table bench. It's hard to describe but a wonderful feat of engineering.
The appetizers were pretty great. The sweet potato fries will give Delux a run for their money & are savory & crispy. The cevice is served with some oversized wonton chips that have a great flavor. The cevice itself has a bit of spice to it thanks to the peppers.
The main dishes are a bit limited right now but the coconut chicken is simply delicious. With a sweet & spicy sauce over a perfectly cooked coconut-crusted chicken, this dish comes with rice & black beans. Really one of the better dishes I've had...plus, there was a lot of it. I had originally ordered the pork but had to steal the chicken from my wife. It was just too good.
For dessert we just had to try the key lime pie. Not only was it NOT some frozen green brick (like most places) but it was a whole mess of complex flavors that made it the best key lime pie I've ever had.
The servers were friendly & attentive. The owner came by & was receptive to input. The chefs were quick & the bar tender was heavy handed with a bomb Trader Vic MaiTai. Everything was great. Add to all of this the fact that it is on the LRT & I can't help but think I'll be spending a lot of time here."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I'm torn on this one!

We had a group of about six on a Tuesday evening. The service was great until we all started ordering. I had to ask for a water refill and for another drink. No biggie, just something that happened. 

The food was pretty good. We ordered a few appetizers. I would recommend the sweet potato fries and the beef sticks. My meal was good (Jerk Chicken Plate) but there were a few small chicken bones which was kind of a turn off.

I would probably return because they have a good happy hour!"}
{"text":"Spotless! Service. Dining room. Restrooms. Patio. Spotless!!

Next time I shall forgo table seating and plop my butt on the floor to eat. Yep. That's how clean Hula's is!

Service was polished and friendly. Dana was working the brunch crowd and attending to everyone's needs. Most importantly everyone enjoyed their brunch.

I say Bula Bula to Hula's!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty decent. I expected a little more around the Tiki theme. The place is out of the way for me so I don't think I will be making the trip again but I'm glad I checked it out once."}
{"text":"Best spot for brunch in the valley. We come here every Saturday morning and belly up to the bar where Jenna has our double mimosas ready to go. The Spam and Portuguese sausage Benedicts are where it's at! This place is usually popping at night, but in my opinion weekend brunch is the best!"}
{"text":"I live 2.3 seconds away from here. 
The place is super chill and great costumer service. 

My drink was always filled up to the top. Its like they watch me take a sip and come over and fill it up. I loveee it. My waitress was cute and so outgoing. You can tell she love what shes doing.

I had all their vegetarian dish here. My favorite one has to be the tofu tacos. Their sauce is so yummy and the black beans is on point.  :)"}
{"text":"I was prepared to love Hula's upon my first visit on a Wednesday evening.  We decided to have happy-hour appetizers as our meal and some Zombie's.  The drinks were great, however we weren't thrilled with the appetizers. 

We had the sweet potato fries. They were under cooked, not good at all, and not even comparable to Fez's.  We barely touched them.

We had the Shrimp Rolls and the Fish Cakes.  The shrimp rolls were fair, a little greasy though.  The fish cakes were tough and tasteless.  They could have been silly putty cakes for all  I knew. 

We also had the pulled pork tacos. They were fair, although they were served cold. 

Maybe it was an off night. I see so many positive reviews that I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"This place is bomb-diggity.

This is not your typical over the top, kitchy tiki bar... but it does manage to take the best elements of tiki and retro chic and put it all into one place. During our trip, we enjoyed all parts of the restaurant:

-the dining area (retro modern and industrial; great to overlook the outside patio)
--the bar area (awesome lighting and display case of tiki tchotchkes, also in view of awesome hexagonal window thing)
--the outside patio (awesome rock fire pit for sitting and drinking by)

So that's just the rad decor...! The food is good and drinks are AMAZING!! There's a menu of about 7-10 tiki type drinks including standards like the Mai Tai, Painkiller, and Zombie... and a few other non-standards (no frozen drinks)... but they run ~$7 and they come served in either a fun tiki glass or class Hula's highball. I had the Dr. Funk, Lillikoi Margarita, and Hawaii 5-0... all excellent, but for different reasons. They also sell cute collectors mugs for $6.

in any event, this place has only been open 4 months... so keep this place in business. go there... go there, now!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go with a bunch of people or just two.  The crowd is pretty hip and \"yuppyish.\"  The menu is pretty unique and the kitchen produces some very distinct and savory tasting dishes.  Have been there a few times and always been very happy with both the food and the service."}
{"text":"Trader Vic's closed down so you would hope that Hula's would pick up the slack and make a proper tiki drink, however just like with The Breadfruit, highly disappointing rum drinks

If you cannot make a proper Mai Tai, you should not call yourself a tiki bar.  Beachbum Berry has laid out the proper way to recreate a Mai Tai, and there is not much room for variation other than amount of lime or orgeat

Having tried 3-4 drinks here you can rest assured the place gives rum drinks a bad name, however most do - just disappointing to see another, and it is the only \"tiki\" bar around

Did not try any food, so no comment there"}
{"text":"Updating the second review and moving up a star. I appreciate that I was contacted about my review. I learned that the lemonade they serve is Minute Maid. That said, I still thought it didn't taste worthy of the level this place sets with their food. And, I do think their food is quite good. I just won't order lemonade when I go back."}
{"text":"I visit this place for the 1st time last week. I had passed this place a couple of times and really wanted to visit mostly due to the outdoor seating and look of the restaurant. I went on a Wednesday night, they had late happy hour which was great. Got a Pink Bikini Martini which was good, Hawaiian Ceviche which was awesome, nice chucks of fish yummy!!!, Also I got the sweet potato fries...loved them. These were just the appetizers which were like $3-$5 during the happy hour time. Since they were so cheap I kinda stocked up on the appetizers. For the main course I have the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl, OMG..it was so good. 
The wait staff was quick and attentive and it was a little busy. 

I would mos def go back to this place, good food, good ambience, great place to go just chill out."}
{"text":"Looks like 3rd time is a charm! The food was Amazing esp the fry's and the pork! Awesome service and I'm willing to chalk my other two visits up to just bad luck based on the individual server. I will be going back again but next time I think I'll try the lunch portion like I had been getting because they give you a lot of food on the reg. menu or whatever it's called."}
{"text":"Crispy coconut shrimp rolls:
Yum! This consists of 2 rolls, each cut in half. These arrived very hot, temperature-wise, fresh out of the fryer. The shrimp and vegetables(?) in the rolls were savory and delicious. There was a nice blend of textures, with a nice crunch from the roll. The cool pineapple-horseradish dipping sauce was slightly sweet and served as a great complement to the savory warm shrimp roll. I would definitely want to try this again!

Hurricane:
This drink was strong! As someone who doesn't drink frequently, I was done after this one drink. Lightweights, beware! The drink tasted a bit too strong for me, so I probably wouldn't order this again."}
{"text":"I would do bad things for a plate of Hula's Jerk fish. 
(It can also be made with tofu, chicken or pork)

I'd probably lick their jerk sauce off of an old shoe.

I'd share a johnny cake with a prison inmate if it meant I got to eat the other half.

I'd go on a date with a homeless man as long as we came here.

If I had to, I'd pour the entire dish in my purse and eat it out with chopsticks."}
{"text":"I sit here wobbling between 3 and 4 stars...it is solidly a 3.5. This was my second time here during their relatively new brunch service. First time I stopped in and enjoyed a cocktail (Mai Tai), which was superb, very well mixed! I stopped in again this past Sunday for the more full brunch experience. I ordered a \"Pain Killer\" to drink (Rum, Pineapple and Orange Juice with Coconut) and the Hula Burger, added cheddar and fried Spam...yes Spam. Who needs bacon when this is an option. LOL! Yeah so I was not counting calories or fat for this meal but, why am I justifyin' this to you. LOL. The burger patty was thick and quality beef, the grilled Maui onions superb and the special sauce was better than I was expecting. It was an aoli with fresh ginger, garlic and stuff (I feared it was going to be sweet originally), I was pleasantly pleased. I had to eat my burger in pieces this thing was huge and juicy. I will definitely be back again...their brunch cocktails are super and I like the open airy atmosphere of the place as a whole."}
{"text":"I think I fall in love with Hula's a little more each time I'm there! The first few times we just went for drinks and drinks turned into lunches, happy hours and now Hula's is a go-to spot for dinner. The vibe is laid back, but cute enough for a date night, the patio is spacious and wonderful for springtime cocktails on the patio and it's been the perfect place for casual business lunches on occasion. The service is always great which is soooo key, but the food is my favorite part. I've never had a single thing I didn't love and continue to try new things. My husband love mexican/american and I'm obsessed with anything asian influenced and this menu proves to be one that gets both of our mouths watering. 

Favorites: 
The spicy shrimp caesar salad is unreal delicious and huge 
Island Style Poke appetizer - a must try. We're obsessed.
The tacos are delicious
I'm in love with the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl.

You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here while on a trip to arizona. Had the tofu tacos and the jungle tofu curry. Food tasted great. Had some cocktail as well (dont remember the name) but it was really light and kind of expensive. I live in california and this was my first trip to phoenix, but the prices of the food and drinks were as much as the SF Bay area at this place. Not sure if prices are justified."}
{"text":"Ada G. took me here before we saw Chelsea Handler so we could get appropriately lubed up (thank you Dr. Funks) and the food is awesome. They have the best poke in town and we shared one of their fish (fishes?) too with the lemongrass coating and it was equally delicious. Their patio is beautiful and contemporary but still casual at the same time. Definitely hit their happy hour because that's the happiest time of day anyway and you mind as well spend it here enjoying delicious eats and tasty libations.  (By the way, why is someone complaining that this is not authentic Hawaiian food when at the same time they ordered a New York Steak sandwich?  Does someone have their crabby pants on or is a geography lesson in order?)"}
{"text":"Do not pass up this place while in Phoenix. My spouse hates seafood and devoured it here."}
{"text":"I have been to Hulas's many times and have had a decent experience here, until the most recent time where I ordered my usual burger and it was just disgusting. I asked for no cooked onion on my burger, only raw onion, and what they brought me was onion all over it. Told the waiter and he took care of it, so he brings me a new plate.... WRONG. All they did was scrape all the cooked onion off, which they missed most of it and served it. The lettuce looked old as hell, had brown on it everywhere. I eventually gave up and had them take it back. I was just about done eating, lost my appetite. They ended up making a new one which wasn't medium like I asked, it was fully done, but at that point I had enough. I've been coming her for a long time and very often, but won't be coming back after this experience and ordering any burgers from them!"}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaian food we've found in Phoenix, and we've been looking. We stay 1-2months a year in Hawaii and can tell you this would be top 10 on any of the islands. Let's start with the Mai Tai. I make a pretty good one, with my own orgeat. Have to, bc generally in Phx they taste like bottled mix. Hula's is better than mine. Citrus comes through and is spot on. The poke is elaborate, but clean and fresh. I like a little wasabi on the side. Shrimp rolls are creative and excellent. The KALUA pork is better than any hotel luau. Our server, Keith, was attentive and knowledgeable. All of this at good value, especially happy hour. We'll be back...often"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. A modern Trader Vics. I would give Hula's a 5 star if parking was a bit easier and there was a misting system on the patio. That being said, everything else was awesome. It has a very cool vibe inside. The layout of the tables and the patio works. We were there kind of early on a Saturday night, around 6. There were plenty of open tables on the patio (because it's Arizona, June, 6pm, HOT) but since we were meeting a large group later we found a couple of seats at the bar. I did notice the dining room was full. Our group was going to be there around 7, so we had an hour to kill.
After we were seated at the bar, our We first sat at the bar and had some appetizers and drinks. The food was all incredible and the drinks were quite tasty. Around 7:30 we decided to join our group so we moved out to the patio. There were 15 of us in all on the patio and we were never left wanting. Our server kept our water glasses filled as well as our drinks. As I said, the only thing I wish they had was a misting system or some way to cool off the patio. It was a bit sticky out there. Arizonan's, we get it. This is my new favorite down town spot."}
{"text":"Couldn't choose between the ribs or the Luau pork plate and the waiter recommended the pork. I thought it was all right, but they sure doused it in 12 gallons of soy sauce and sort of over did it with the sweet pineapples. After being forced to eat white rice every night for the past 19 years due to a very persuasive/aggressive Asian mother, I vowed to stop eating it when I got out of the house but because it was so overly sweet and salty, I had to ask for more of the rice that came with it just to mellow my mouth out. 

While I should give it 3 stars, I can honestly say that you cannot beat their happy hour prices. Thanks to this place, my boyfriend and my wallet are both happy and he's able to drop his 'macho' guard, He now happily drinks Orange Martinis and Mai Tai's, but at Hula's. Anywhere else and it's back to his manly Samuel Adams and Four Peaks. Le sigh."}
{"text":"This cool restaurant was great!!! Kind of had a 70s Hawaiian vibe.  The ribs and the Mai Tais were to die for.  I highly recommend and can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for my birthday with co-workers and i liked the atmosphere so came back for the happy hour--had a great time with friends.  

Is a little expensive, but had great service from our server-girl with robot tattoo--so nice!

I think i loved the cocktails better than the food, POLYNESIAN CHICKEN SANDWICH was pretty good with the SWEET POTATOE FRIES!!  

Most drinks were fabulous, need to try the Scorpion bowl with lots of friends!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a restaurant is more than the sum of it's parts. The outdoor patio is a great place to enjoy a leisurely meal. Start with a Mai-tai and the poke. The poke is always fresh and wonderfully tasty. A little more avocado would help though. For dinner, you can't go wrong with the burgers and get the side Caesar. Mmmmm. The fish dishes are also excellent but for my dollar, the burgers win out big time here. The ambience is awesome- great art on the walls and the staff is super  friendly. Kyle rocks!! Add it together and this has become my favorite place to grab a bite or take a date."}
{"text":"The south seas grilled fish tacos were so excellent! Good atmosphere & great service well complimented an evening shared with newfound friends! I'll definitely be back...so many mouth watering menu items tempting me!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday night with a group of friends and our experience was horrible. Our waitress was rude and basically forgot about us. We ordered the scorpion bowl and it tasted very watered down and the pricing of the food did NOT reflect its quality. I would not recommend this place, if i could give no stars i would."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the fish bites! Oh, the Mai Tai's! I love this place. Outside is nice in good weather. The pulled pork benedict is delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE hulas. Their food is so good. I always get the ahi tacos. Spicy and delicious. The prices are super reasonable. The staff is always so friendly. Great atmosphere.

My favorite part is the dog friendly patio :) I always bring my pup to hang out on the patio (we call it Yappy Hour) and our server always brings out a bowl of water immediately for her!

I would recommend this place to anyone for great food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Maybe we came on an off night but my girlfriends and I were not impressed from the food to the service. Atmosphere was nice. Food was good but nothing to come back for... and the service... wow the service was terrible.

We got seated fine. But after that it was bad. We didn't get any attention for a long time finally after the people behind us had water I went up to the hostess stand where a server was and asked for our server.. she asked if I seated ourselves which we didn't (and I thought that was rude to ask... we were seated for about 10 minutes even if we had-again we didnt- someone should have addressed us) and then said she would ask. The same girl then came a few minutes later with water. Then finally our server came and apologized that no one told her we were here.... maybe they don't know their tables before we are seated but she definitely saw us as she had the two tables next to us but never addressed us. Anyway it took awhile to get everything and our appetizer we needed to ask for plates when we were clearly sharing... we had to ask for water to be refilled... we waited a while for our check but then everything sped up. I guess they wanted to get paid....

Anyway overall I debated between 2 and 3 stars but gave 2 because my friends who live down the street said they wouldn't be back... which I feel shows how disappointed we were... I feel like 3 stars means we would be back but we most likely won't."}
{"text":"We really love this place.  Service is outstanding and the food is great.  We started with the shrimp rolls as an appetizer and my wife had the Thai Bowl and I had the perfect lobster bisque and seared ahi on wonton chips with wasabi cream and ginger.  All excellent.  We finished by sharing a slice of very good key lime pie.  Drinks are strong and tasty.  All of this happened in a great, open atmosphere.  Everybody who works here is happy.  Everybody who eats here is happy.  We will be back.....probably this weekend."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place. I've only been for small plates but have eaten my face off. Yup. Maybe I shouldn't be bragging about that. 

\"Grazes. Watch your valuables tho.\"
\"Will leave no blade of grass unturned.\"
\"Has the mouth of a Hoover.\"

Er - perhaps I should revise those warning labels. What I'm trying to convey is that the food here is gosh darn good. The service is always with a smile. And this place is super group friendly. This can be dangerous. Watch out! I mean, for your waist lines!

I'm going to start with a SERVER SHOUT OUT.

My most recent adventure was under the tutelage of a bomb diggity server named William G. (#68). This kid was zip zagging seamlessly inside and out to help a number of large tables. I gotta tell you something - come closer - this kid is solid gold. Waiting on groups is not like taking attendance. (Unless that involves herding cats in the dark.) 

There's a reason they ask for your party to be present in order to be seated. It's so taking orders is easier. Did we do that?
Nope.

Were we consistent in our ordering pace all night?
Nope.

Did we have a lot of questions?
Uh huh.

Did he ever break his smile?
Nope.

Did he have time for me to point out a $0.50 HH hour difference on the menu for a draft beer? Um, NO. The kid was still smiling and super pleasant to boot. Gold! (Probably hates me.)

HAPPY HOUR
Dood. They have four beers on tap, generally on the lighter side. (Note: Currently stocking a Koko Brown which is dark, \"coconut inspired\" which I am a fan of.) $3.50 or $4, not sure. Whatever the price it's a good deal before 6pm.

Late to HH? Can't be here by 6pm? 
Follow them on Twitter for their \"Word of the Day\". You'll want it for super special pricing on drinks. (I heard you can also receive it via email.)

FOOD
Holy Smoke! There are very rich foods (watch those waist lines) and delightfully healthy, small portion options. HOH so good! My photos have some of my favorites. Right now what I would give for a HH tofu or pork taco.  (Yeah, I went out last night. Need some replenishing.) $3 provides a taco that can be served into *two* portions. That rules! And it fits with my balanced approach to not exercising. 

Hey! I'll get back to the gym. 
Someday.
Right.

Until then, I'll come drink and be merry. Here.

And, apparently at the new location that is opening in Scottsdale.

TOO MANY CHOICES!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! A trendy Phoenician take on the classic island flavors. Manaia tele! We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Tiki-ish Bar

I may or may not remember correctly, but I think back when it was \"in\" & computers and smart phones weren't ubiquitous...that this location used to be one of those fancy cutting edge cyber-cafes.  All that fresh e-mail and a little SPAM ... a harbinger of what was to come...HULA's & spam spam spam spam spammity spam! ... Benedict.

These days, the only SPAM you'll find here is on the menu! 

Throw out the junk e-mail and order that SPAM benedict. For an official cleanse of your hard drive...upload a \"tiki bastard!\" or two. They have a wide selection of tropical tonics.  

The patio here is very spacious, dog-friendly and the restaurant is casual and open air. The mai-tais are the straightforward option and tasty. I think my favorite item on the food menu is the Poke. Other offerings were good, but just not as memorable (thank goodness for photos ;)  

Our service has been hit and miss, otherwise I'd have made this a four star review. 

I also think this place is a wee bit island-priced if it ain't happy hour. Aloha to then: the \"Hula Bucks\" that are good any time it isn't Happy Hour (or some other promo) but it always seems to be HH or something else, so I've never gotten to cash in a hula buck.  

I'd go again."}
{"text":"I was actually having a decent time at my most recent visit to Hula's Modern Tiki. Our server was on top of her stuff and never left drinks empty. I found it to be a bit pricey for the area -- $14 for a platter of chicken, rice and plantains. But aside from the crunchy rice, it was good.

My problem came at the end of my visit. Our server informed me that she used my card to ring up someone else's check (it was almost double the price of my check). She informed me that she took care of it and it would straighten out in a couple days. No worries, it happens. What she failed to tell me was that not only did she charge my card for the wrong check, she also charged me for my check. Double swipe = double charge. I was under the impression she just refunded the difference. This caused an enormous headache for me. It was a Friday night. Because she swiped my card twice, it put a fraudulent security hold on my card. I was unable to use it all weekend long. By the time I got everything sorted out and got my money back, it was Wednesday. 

This isn't something that should've been handled by a server. This was a management problem. If she would have come over and told me right away what happened, I would have just opted to pay her in cash. I know sometimes that double swipe sends my security settings into an angry frenzy. I'm hoping this was an isolated incident and not something generally handled by servers. The event caused me such a headache, I will definitely not be back."}

Not a destination dining experience, that's for sure.
I would say over-hyped, but over-hipped is more like it.

I'm sure it's all so impressive to someone less jaded and cynical, but c'mon. 
This is really nothing more than someone collecting all of the 'exotic' dishes one at a time from generic american restos like applebees and chilis, and combining them onto one menu in one place.

Omigosh! You put a ring of grilled pineapple and some terriyaki on my chicken sandwich?!?  OOOH, how pacific rim fusion.  Someone call Martin Denny."}
{"text":"Modern tiki restaurant with great outdoor space. Drinks all include rum so prepare yourself for a carribean-like evening. They have a full bar so dont worry if you dont like rum. Just had drinks here but heard the food is fab. Check in with the hostess before you sit or you'll be asked to get up. Overall a great place to meet for a date or large groups. You can sit inside or out, which is great for summer evenings."}
{"text":"Update! I have been back to Hula's many times since the first time and it is still (fairly) consistently good. I love Hula's patio and fire pit...it is so nice on a cool day to sit by the fire while enjoying some beverages. Speaking of beverages, Hula's has a fantastic happy hour ('Tiki Time'). Drinks are about 5$ and it goes until 7 pm, even on Saturdays. This is craziness! The BF and I went there a few weeks ago and drank many many beverages (He likes the Dr. Funk and I am in love with the Lilikoi margarita (it is very tasty, trust me)) and the bill was still very reasonable. The food is somewhat hit and miss (hence the 4 star review), they have delicious jerk pulled pork that is always good, but other items were a miss such as the potstickers (tasted like Ling Ling's), the macadamia crusted fish (was pretty bland), and the chicken tacos (too big and not flavorful enough). I would probably stick to the pork. I STILL haven't had their coconut banana pie, but it always looks good....I might go there tonight and get it :-D."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops!!! The atmosphere is awesome!!! The food is amazing!! We always get the coconut shrimp spring rolls, and the spicy edamame. Very good. And I usually choose from any of the fish. I like that you can pick what you want and how you want it cooked etc. The burgers are amazing if you don't like fish and so is the salads!!"}
{"text":"came here for my bday dinner and sat outside under the burners. super cool and chill place. the waitress was super nice. the food was good and the music was cool. hippie vibes."}
{"text":"Having met some of the owners before it opened, I really wanted to love this place. The location is perfect, the concept is fun, the atmosphere is exciting, and the decor is wonderful.

But now that the head chef has gone back to the originals back in California, the place is a train wreck.

They started off on the wrong foot by sending out the worst $12 hurricane I've ever had. For a signature drink, I expected... something. Not a glass of ice. With a little juice and the most unbalanced, disgusting mix of rum I've ever tasted.

The blackened fish sandwich they sent out had raw spots. Pink, squishy, a little cold. Whoever made it had no idea how to sear a fish.

The pulled pork was perfectly caramelized, really just amazing. But it was buried under a slaw that may have come from an inspired recipe, but was atrociously executed. It was completely inedible, and it ruined the pork as well.

The sweet potato fries were nice to munch on, but they were served with \"Hula sauce,\" which our waiter accurately compared to In-n-Out's special sauce: Ketchup and mayonnaise. 

After spending $40, we sent back most of our food and left hungry."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends a couple of weeks ago.  As appetizers, we ordered a half and half order of sweet potato and house cut fries, crispy coconut shrimp rolls, spicy edamame and crispy fish bites.  All of the appetizers were quite tasty.  The spicy edamame is definitely spicy - leaves your lips burning a bit - but they were oh so good.  I loved the pineapple horseradish sauce with the shrimp rolls - great pineapple flavor.  

For dinner, I had the blackened wasabi Hapu - lightly blackened over wasabi mashed potatoes with seasonal veggies.  The flavor on the fish was good as were the potatoes but I'd like to have a little more kick for the potatoes - just a little more wasabi flavor.  

We also had dessert - coconut cream pie.  You definitely want to save room for this.  It was very creamy - very rich - very delicious.

I believe Bailey was our server that night - absolutely wonderful - provided us with a lot of laughs and great service!"}
{"text":"We visited Hula's last night with our Dinner Club...and the 13 of us gave it an awesome review.  The service was excellent, the drinks were delicious (HH all day on Saturday until 7...drink specials only), and everyone was very happy with their food.  

From what I tasted my faves were the Blood Orange Martini, the coconut shrimp rolls, the poke, the wasabi fish, the korean beef short ribs, and mac 'n cheese.  I liked the vibe...casual & interesting...old school Hawaii Five-O on the wall, classic 80's music playing, garage doors open to the patio, and the huge hexagonal window.  Would love to come back and hang next to the fire pit when it's a little warmer out.

Totally recommended!!"}
{"text":"Fun place for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. On Wednesday's they have all night happy hour. The signature cocktails are fun & come in cool tiki glasses. Great location off the light rail, but still plenty of parking in the lot. It's fun to get the Volcano bowl when you have a group. I've only ever had the chicken sandwich as I am not much of a seafood fan, but it's good chicken. Someone else in my group ordered the butter fish and said it was the best fish they've had. I have only been to brunch here once and it was a long time ago - will need to try that again soon."}
{"text":"I've probably been to Hula's half a dozen times now and figured it was time to write up a rather glowing review. Never have had anything but great service here, the food has always been consistently amazing and they make some awesome house cocktails. I've come for happy hour quite a few times, and we even came here on NYE for their live music and all-night happy hour - what a fun crowd and a great time. Brunch on the weekends has always treated me great as well, I love their spin on a benedict. All in all, a solid go-to spot with a fun theme in downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"I am in love this spot! I have made it my personal mission to try all the restaurants in uptown and this stop did not disappoint! We went on first Friday around 6 which was risky but they seated a table for two in about 15 minutes. They play great music btw. We got Kona big wave on draft which not a lot of places have. We ordered the potstickers, I got the Hapu fish and my boyfriend got one of their sandwiches. All the food was AMAZING! We loved every bite and were planning out what we were going to try next time as we finished up our beers. A great spot in uptown and a must try for the food and bomb atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is just plain FUN!  If you are in town and want to go hang out with your friends at some place different this is a place I would choose.  They have a large patio with fire pits and space heaters for the cooler months that are perfect for your hip crew. 

Admittedly I have only been here for drinks (not that this is a problem) and do not feel comfortable giving more stars until I eat here as well.  

Anyway they have drinks named the Scorpion and Volcano that come with multiple straws for your group to enjoy, but if you are going to partake in these be sure you have a way home! :) Just ask my friend Mark. 

To all of you out there from Tucson or UofA this is the new and improved Kon Tiki for you to enjoy as you pretend to be grown up for everyone else this is a fun change of scene."}
{"text":"This is one of my boyfriend and I's favorite spots. We live super far from here but we still travel from North Phoenix to come eat. We always start with a Poke bowl mixed with the ahi tuna (trust me it's delicious). Very very good quality fish. The sweet potatoes make a great side to any meal and don't even get me started on the dipping sauce OMG! I always get the ahi tuna sandwich it has all of the right flavors! Our favorite brewery is Kona and they serve it. My only wish is that they would have Big Wave more often :] I am VERY VERY pleased with Hula's. It's like being in Hawaii without the beach. Great atmosphere and even better service! Our food is always out fast and every server we have had always makes sure we are taken care of regardless how busy it is."}
{"text":"Lobster Bisque is the business. Bartender John was attentive and had a great demeanor and personality. Good experience all around."}
{"text":"Once again, a great meal at Hula's! We got there at Happy Hour time, so it was a little chaotic, but we were seating in about 5 minutes. 
The staff there is always super friendly and we were lucky that Dana came and said hi. He's an owner who \"gets it\" when it comes to responding to customers, as he did after my first review.
The Jamaican Jerk Chicken Plate was uh-mazing! When it arrived and I saw the portion of chicken, I almost asked if they had made a mistake. It was a HUGE pile of jerk chicken! The dish also came with Johnny Cakes. Corn cakes with spices and fruit? Yes, please! Fried plantains are also one of my favorites and theirs were perfect! The right amount of crispy on the edges and sweet and and and foodgasm!

This place is always busy when I drive by. Know what that says? Just another great spot to eat in CenPho!

Thanks, Dana!"}
{"text":"Good food, great ambiance! Great happy hour but the waiters won't tell you happy hour is almost over and by the time you realize it...it's already over."}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent Service! I had the black bean burger and it was very yummy and big!! Also, the sweet potato fries and the greens salad were quite tasty. I will definetly go back."}
{"text":"Hulas is one of my favorite restaurants! I keep coming back for their pork tacos and their shrimp rolls! My friends and I have tired almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really great food!  So fun to have the Jerk fish with Jamaican Johnny cakes on the side.  I asked for the coconut crusted fish but our server said that was taken off the menu because they had too many complaints.  I did get my coconut fix anyway, with the shrimp coconut appetizer.  Great food!  There were quite a few flies around, yuck.  Service was mediocre.  Cool building and environment.  If go again and hope for a different server and less flies."}
{"text":"Once again Hulas is impressive our waiter our wise and bearded waiter Kyle (I think his name is Kyle) was great. Thank guys keep up the good work I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place all 5 stars because I absolutely love Hula, but  I only gave it 4 because it has been inconsistent the 3 times I have been there. My faves are the poke (incredible and I don't even really eat that stuff), ceviche, and the coconut shrimp rolls. The ceviche has been inconsistent between having a ton of lime/citrus flavor to none at all. I have had the ceviche all 3 times I have been there (and will continue to do so) so I am hoping that the dish becomes more consistent. Plus, the wontons that come with it have ranged from not being greasy, to being totally greasy. (The totally greasy wontons were the same day as the completely bland ceviche so I was totally disappointed the last time I ordered this dish.) As I mentioned, hopefully it gets more consistent. The spicy seaweed salad was pretty good and so is their slaw. Things I did not like were the plantains, johnny cakes and pineapple wine. I thought the pineapple wine would be a sweet desert wine, but weirdly, it wasn't sweet but had hints of pineapple. If you like the softer, sweeter version of plantains, this is for you. I prefer the more thin, crisper plantains that aren't sweet. 

It may seem like my experiences have been bad but they aren't. I don't expect to like everything on the menu but will continue to try new things and risk not liking it. But the things that I do like keep bringing me back. This isn't necessarily a place to bring kids, so my husband and I tend to order takeout. When we have eaten there, however, we really enjoyed the atmosphere. The owner is consistently there checking on various aspects and greeting the guests. Very friendly guy. This place is a great addition to the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I didn't really \"get it\".
I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats.

*  Bar was great.
*  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic.
*  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome.
*  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they don't neem much more than salt and time).

Awesome location.
Menu will expand I am sure.
Repaint the bathroom please."}
{"text":"The hula burger was awesome! Great service. The hostess is very kind and sweet. What a great find!"}
{"text":"First time officially going out for Tiki drinks -
and Hula's is definitely the place to go for a good, cheap, local tiki cocktail!

If it's cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio - I highly recommend it. Inside can be a bit crowded and noisy like a cafeteria..

Moving onward - during happy hour, most tiki drinks are only $5! And they have some yummy food on special too! (The spicy edamame was delicious.)

While we were there, we got the Dr. Funk, Painkiller, Zombie and the One-Eyed Pyrat. They were all great but the Dr. Funk and the Zombie were definitely my fave! The presentation of the drinks is awesome too. Each drink comes in a tiki mug to match the theme of your drink; so fun! Now I know why so many people are into tiki cocktails! I think I may be a new fan!

From what I hear and have seen, they have a pretty good dessert menu!
I definitely gotta try a piece of their Coconut Cream Pie next time! ;)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! Stumbled upon this restaurant through a Yelp suggestion. My husband and I dined inside on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is amazing. Loved the modern decor. The service was fantastic! Our waitress made sure my water glass never got empty. She must have refilled my glass 6 times! Our food came out extremely fast! Everything we ordered was SO delicious! The grilled chicken sandwich was so unique and flavorful. Highly recommend this restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was there twice last week if that's any indication. I've had the Polynesian chicken sandwich and the peek tacos and both were tasty. The ceviche is also delicious. Or had coconut milk in our which makes it that much better. Also, their mac and cheese is delicious. More than the food though, the reason i like it is that it is so laid back. It's great to sit in the patio and enjoy the amazing weather. The staff is very friendly and fast and efficient. Also Wednesday they have their happy hour prices all day."}
{"text":"Come for happy hour! The drinks are cheap and STRONG! Real strong!!! I love the indoor/outdoor feel to the place especially when the weather is nice (which is always right now). We pretty much ordered all the food off the happy hour menu and were not disappointed. The food came out fast and hot. Everything was yummy and was perfect with our very strong drinks! Will definitely be back soon for that afternoon buzz."}
{"text":"Been here a total of 3 different times and have been happy for each of those times!

Atmosphere: feels like you are in a tiki hut off some island :)

The food: have not had dinner here, but I can make a dinner out of coconut shrimp egg rolls and at Happy hour Prices....awesome deal, I think!

Drinks: i like them sweet, and they got them good, and strong, if you ask me. 

Highly suggest the place, great atmosphere, several tvs so you can watch the game, sit outside and enjoy the nice Phx weather coming our way, or in the dining area. GO!"}
{"text":"Wow! the food was great! Best with pork sandwich that I've had in a while! The ambience of the restaurant was Great reminded me of a cool restaurant in the heart of LA I loved it I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. I ate here 4x in the same week. Ahi tuna is delicious in both the Caesar salad and the tacos. The shrimp salad is also delicious. 

Nice atmospheres, inside, although when it's crowded, it can feel a little cramped. Tables are very close together in some places."}
{"text":"Loved the mai tai and the French fries. Do not... I repeat... do not get the poke or seaweed salad. Big disappointments. Cool place to hang out and eclectic crowd. I would go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork (taco, Hawaiian, Jamaican Jerked) dishes and salmon (macadamia nut crust)."}
{"text":"Cute place with very friendly staff.  My wife loves the spicy Thai fish cakes, crisp exterior, flaky fish inside with very nice flavor.  I had the steak sandwich which was a bit tough but very flavorful."}
{"text":"Always have the Ceviche it's delicious and the shining star of the meal. It's such a clean light dish. Absolutely adore the won ton chips that come with it. The neon multicoloured straws are a fun touch! The cesar salad it's also delicious! Good clean iced tea. Eventually I'm going have some of the super delicious looking cocktails!! Service is always very good and I like the open floor plan with the openness to outside."}
{"text":"All of my experiences at Hula's have been pleasant. Sitting at the bar or by the fire, it's a good atmosphere. The waitstaff are cool and the food service is timed nicely. I'm trying to find excuses to give more stars, but there is something just pulling back my fourth star and I think it's the sparkle. There is no sparkle for me.

The food is ok, but not awesome. Some things are done very well like the jungle sauce on the tofu or the fish on the fish sammie. But other things are not, like the actual tofu or the bread on the sandwich. Not a fan of the super sweet cocktails, and no wine specials for happy hour. To boot, I just don't get that feeling of soaking up the sweet Phoenix scene that's common to the Central/Camelback hot spot.

I always feel a little confused after coming here. My belly is full but my taste buds underwhelmed. Eager to be part of a cool neighborly social joint but not feeling the sweet CenPho vibes. The feeling is more like, [head cocked to the side, shoulder shrug] \"That was aight.\""}
{"text":"A few of us from the office lunch here somewhat frequrntly.  My favorite dishes are the kobi burger, the spiced shrimp Caesar salad and the spicy chicken bowl.  Good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"**UPDATE** After the owner of Hula's reached out and asked us to give it another go, we went back and had a much better experience. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and the Cajun burger, which were both delicious. Big thanks to Hula's for taking the time to contact us :)"}
{"text":"My daughters chicken fingers were better than our meal. The Hulas in CA is FAR superior. Underwhelmed by the pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Review based on service only, would have given 0 stars if I had the chance. We had Kaitlyn helping us tonight and I've never been so disappointed. It took her over 10 minutes to come greet the table. After that it took another 10 minutes until I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender to make me a drink since she failed to bring it to me. Our food came out correctly, yet she didn't bring the food out to us and only asked if we needed anything after we had already eaten everything. She took forever to pick up our tab and overall just wasn't a good server. Not once did she apologize for how incredibly slow she was working and didn't have an ounce of personality. 

I love Hulas and come often, but if I ever have this server again I will most likely walk out. The food is amazing but it's not worth spending money here if I have to wait forever to receive it. 

Overall food is 5/5 stars, but your service needs work..."}
{"text":"Since the last writing, the owner has gone out of his way to make everything better.  I've never been treated with such courtesy or respect by a business owner-- truly a changed perception.  We've received a lot and more in the way of makeup cred, and while this is not to encourage others to write bad reviews, I believe Dana, the owner, really cares about his clientele.  The kitchen has gone above and beyond to make everything we have ordered hot, fresh, and delicious.  Congrats on the perfect turnaround, guys, and many thanks for the conversation and remuneration.  Well done.  5/5"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I have driven by countless times, saying,  \"we got to check that place out!\"   I am glad we finally did.  Trader Vic himself would be proud of this little urban tiki joint.  I will keep it simple today and address the big 3 restaurant components one at a time.

SERVICE

Attentive and happy to have us from the moment we walk in the door, the first time was a mellow Tuesday afternoon.  The bartender/server was engaging and helpful and most of all ,exuded a great pride for his place.   He had a key element you just can't train into staff - Pride.  He was proud of his drinks, his menu, the whole place.  He must have got this from the owner who took time to give us a mini tour and talk about some of the unique and creative design elements.  (in a moment)  On a later visit during the more jumpin' late hours that same excitemnet to be there oooozed from the entire staff.  Refreshing to be in  place where people want to work.

FOOD AND DRINK

The Pork Sandwich was very good and so was my wifes salad, the drinks were authentic yet creative and I can honestly not say a bad word about anything.  I have seem some luke warm response to the food at Hula's.  I believe this is unfair, the food is more than fine.  It just isn't the first reason why I return.  

ATMOSPHERE

Unique, creative and original design make this place interesting and fun.  On our mini tour we saw the amazing glass front bar, welcoming huge wood common tables, and stellar use of various materials all coming together perfectly.  The patio was open and comfortable.  We were on a little 1 hour vacation it seemed.  The kind of place that keeps you there once you are in.  

For the local downtown-istes, it should be a mainstay of your circuit.  For those of you in the bookends of the valley who only leave your bubble for a ball game, put this on the list of places to hit on the way home.  I will probably see you there."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This is a gay friendly venue... great atmosphere and the servers were fun and friendly. Sadly there is no healthy choice menu and the drinks where beyond disappointing. Wouldn't rush back. The attached picture is my health salad smothered with dressing!!"}
{"text":"YUM! 

I've been recommended to go here several time and finally got a chance to. The decor is fun and modern. We went on a Friday night around  6pm and there was no wait. The table we were seated at was a little too close to our neighboring table. We could hear their entire conversation and they could hear ours. We has fun trying to figure out if they were on tinder date 1, 2 or 3.

We had trouble picking from the menu because everything sounded so good. I love the hawaiian and jamaican spices so every single thing on the menu was right up my alley.

We ordered the poke as an appetizer and it was the best outside of Hawaii that I've had. 

I finally decided on the Jawaiian Jerk pork plate and my boyfriend got the fish tacos. We were both satisfied with the meal. He just wished there was more fish and less \"stuff\" in the tacos.

Side note: The jerk pork tasted EVEN BETTER the next day as a leftover :)

The reason why I am giving Hulas a 4 star rather than 5 star rating is that I think its a bit overpriced. My meal was $14 it should have been $10-$12. Don't go here if you are looking for a cheap, good meal. Was an expensive dinner for 2 after drinks. 

Will return as a treat every now and again."}
{"text":"I have been here with my girlfriend three times now. We absolutely love this place, they have great food and drinks. I always get their Steak Sandwich, and its amazing every time!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will be coming back"}
{"text":"I'd say that if you're looking for something different but not too different this could be the place to try.I like this place because it's trendy, modern, and makes a good dinner spot on a night out. Get the fish tacos, they are above expectations-worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Hula's has an impressive cocktail menu that included many of those multi-ingredient drinks that you never have all of the makings for at home. I had the mai tai and let me say, they did not skimp on the rum! It was strong and delicious. Worth the eight dollar price. 

The menu is huge with a large variety of choices. We had 17 people in our party and every single dish looked delicious. I immediately had dinner envy though when my friend's ahi tuna Caesar arrived. It had a generous heap of perfectly cooked ahi on top!

Attentive staff. Clean dining room. Good food and cocktails. Definitely worth s visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one night for dinner. I like the decor a lot; really nice ambiance. Our server was really attentive and helpful, too.

The habanero chicken tacos are good. I really like the rice and beans, but I didn't think the tacos were that spicy. To be fair, I do have a high threshold for spiciness, so my criticism isn't the most fair. Still, the tacos were good.

My husband got the burger. He didn't really care for it, but I don't think Hula's is the kind of place you go to for a burger. If you go and you're thinking about getting a burger, just don't. Try something else, like some tacos or the ribs. I will say that the accompanying Caesar salad was fantastic. I did not expect such a good salad but it was really excellent.

Mai tais are delish, but super strong! If you're going to have more than one, make sure you have someone to drive you home (who hasn't been sipping on mai tais with you).

Overall, very nice. I'd like to stop by again."}
{"text":"for an appetizer we got the fried fish which i loveeeed. for my entree, i got the pulled pork and i wasn't expecting it to be spicy (or perhaps it's just me since i can barely handle any spice at all) so i couldn't enjoy it to the fullest. i did like my drink so much that i ordered 2 of them, though. i think it was a tiki bastard?"}
{"text":"This last sunday, one of my best friends was having his birthday dinner at Hulus. And since I have never been to a tiki bar outside out Japan or Hawaii (the one in Japan was just a Hawaiiian islands bar but same thing) so I was ready to see what Hulus had to offer. 

The atmosphere is not over the top tiki but it could use a few more statues. They have a nice patio area which would be nice but it was too cold to use. But lets jump to the heart of the matter, that is the drinks. Oh my. Rum is one of my strong vices. Add fruit juice and I would mostly likly drink it out of a shoe. But besides the fact that sentence shows some crippling alcoholicsm, I dont get to indulge in rum beverages very often. But they had my favorite \"Dark and Stormy\" which had Ginger Beer as the main mixer instead of juice. And this was mixed perfectly, so much so that it gave off a Dark and Tan floating illusion. I would go back just for that. 

How about the food? Man can not survive on rum alone. But dammit we try, 

The food was very good. Three people I was sitting next to got the Tofu bowl and raved about it. The one guy who got the chicken was also pleased. I got the Calamari burger just because I never seen a Calamari burger before. And it was to be expected. It needed to be bit more spicy and a lot more crunchy but still good, since I ate it all. 

Basically....they do a great Dark and Stormy. And if that doesnt get you go then nothing wil."}
{"text":"My friend has been here before and recommend we go for drinks & apps. We went on a Wednesday so happy hour prices are all day which is awesome! The drink & food menu offer many choices and variety, which I really liked! I ordered a Mai   Tai which was really good! Not too sweet and you could taste the liquor for only $5 The sweet potato fries with secret sauce were excellent and shrimp rolls were pretty yummy too. We just had apps but I will def be back for lunch or dinner :) :)"}
{"text":"Great food and service and drinks. Brunch was great and prices are solid. Can't say enough about it. One of the only exotic food spots in town as far as island food. Sides are really great and the apps are good. Poke app, seaweed salad, ahi Benedict, and any burger w Pineapple was how we ate. We left with a smile. 

Will come back for dinner and have more fish"}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm a huge fan of fish, and everything you get is delicious.  Honestly you're better off getting a \"bowl\" or a burger rather than an entree, you get more food for less money, how does that work?

I had my 27th birthday party here and they were more than accommodating. they let us decorate and didn't have a problem with my friend delivering cake. which i know most restaurants frown upon outside food. but they were more than nice.  i always enjoy my experiences here.  if it was a bit cheaper i would definitely come more often"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at this spot however I have to admit I was expecting more traditional Hawaiian food not Hawaiian fusion cuisine so I was a bit disappointed however everything we ordered was packed with flavor especially the wings!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great..good prices at happy hour too.  Problem here is the environment.  An open wall allows too many flies inside--I had to fight a bunch off my taco.  And the customers...SCUMMY HOMELESS types, the ones you see begging on the street--I always wondered where they spend their  money--They eat here!  NASTY!! And worse they appear to be 'regulars' since they are on a first name basis with the servers.  NASTY!!!   I will return but I think I will go to the Scottsdale location from now on--can't be any worse."}
{"text":"Delish ! My Hubby was on a mission to find the best rum drink and I remembered Hula's making a delicious drink called \"the painkiller\" at Devoured. The drink was just as good , if not better , it will knock your socks off if you have too many , but the taste is so delicious that you better have a cab driver on speed dial . We shared fish bites for an appetizer, the fish was extremely fresh and lighter than expected. I hope to make it back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Mostly pluses! Came at 5pm for early dinner. 
Tried HH apps, pot stickers and shrimp egg rolls. Hearty portion, and pot stickers were rather thick and heavy, but tasted good.Tasty dipping sauce.
Shrimp roll was very crispy fried half's of egg rolls. Pretty good. 
Wife had Baja fish tacos, which she enjoyed.
I had the 1/2 slab of BBQ ribs, and they were excellent! Came with perfect sweet potato fries and some forgettable cole slaw.
Service was good, pleasant vibe. So glad we had an excuse to finally try this place."}
{"text":"Wow, the manager's demeanor was brash and he lacks emotional intelligence.  What a cluster trying to get seated at our table. :( On an upside, the food and drinks are yummy, but I always think twice about coming here."}
{"text":"I now understand why it's called Hula's MODERN Tiki. It definitely has a trendy air to it. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the large lunch portions. I got a fish sandwich with a side salad. The salad was surprisingly delicious, basically greens and sesame seeds with a citrus dressing. The fish sandwich was good, as expected. The bread was fantastic! I'd definitely like to come back for a happy hour experience :)"}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop in with a really cool ambiance. Hula's made room for our larger party outside on the patio, and they weren't kidding when they said the heaters would warm us up. Thanks! The drinks are really nice here and the food is good. Not my very favorite food, mind you, but good. Everybody loves the spiciness of their dishes. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday for a friend's birthday.  The best thing about the experience by far was the spicy edamame.  Man, that stuff was good!  The ceviche was also tasty as was the seaweed salad.  I also tried the ahi sashimi which was just OK.  Our group sat at the community table and hung out for quite a while trying all the fabulous drinks offered for the \"tikki time\" specials.  The Pink Bikini was the best one in my opinion.  The service was awesome, but then again they weren't all that busy.  I was actually really surprised at how slow it was; from the other reviews I thought it would be a Saturday night hot spot... but I guess it is more of an after work Happy Hour type place.  The patio outside looked very comfy and although I liked the look of the modern decor inside, the seating was not that same relaxed resort vibe.  They need to get some couches or lounge chairs in the bar area instead of just the plastic bar stools.  I did really enjoy the music selection but at times it was a little hard to hear the conversation.  I will definitely be back to try out the patio experience when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"We will definitely come back here soon! Came for a random date night and lucked out on a 2 n' 2 night! Meaning 2 appetizers and 2 signature drinks for $20. Our food had so much flavor and the vibe was relaxed and fun. Best part of all is that it was dog friendly !"}
{"text":"Thank god the tiki bar is open!  Love this place as it is the ONLY tiki bar in Phoenix.  It is excellent though.  Happy Hour is a terrific deal filled with urban hipsters on the patio with the light rail buzzing by.  Eat there or venture in to the restaurant and enjoy delicious tropical drinks with fare such as jerk pork, fresh spring rolls or my favorite the Caribbean Mango Chicken Caesar salad.  Did I say the drinks are AMAZING?  Well, they are."}
{"text":"After a couple of technical complications early in their operation, I've been back a few times and always come to the same conclusion: Go for the drinks, not the food. 

At first I thought, \"Maybe I'm just in a bitchy mood and it's throwing my taste buds off.\" But I've gone with different people and been mostly in a chipper mood so that wasn't it. Then I thought I was ordering odd items off the menu, but I've tried a variety of items from the brunch and dinner menus and come to the same conclusion. Finally, I decided Hula's is an awesome place to get a great cocktail. It's just meh on the food side. 

Hula's definitely has one cool patio, amazing architectural features and mighty friendly staff. I just can negate the eating experiences to provide a better rating. It won't be my last time here, so I'm hoping I can update with a more sparkly review."}
{"text":"Always have loved the vibe here and have enjoyed coming here since they first opened. Was very disappointed on our visit last nite, with a party of six patrons for a friends birthday celebration. The service was very sub par to say the least, and the establishment was not even busy. The problem seemed to be our server had better things to do other then servicing our table. For starters, she was more interested in socializing with her co-workers at the bar during most of our stay, then it got even worse when her boyfriend came in and sat at the bar waiting for her. 

So here is how our experience went down. The menus sat on the table the whole time we sat at our table from appetizers to desert, with no bus service at all. Every cocktail glass, appetizer plate, main course plate were left for us to contend during our stay, even all the way up to the piece of desert pie for the birthday man. We were swimming in a china cabinet at the table. So with no bus service we also had no drink service, I had to go up to the bar and interrupt our server during her social hour a few times for our drink orders. The first time I approached her at the bar for drink service since she basically abandoned her table, she then popped back at me with an attitude and told me to give her a moment. I then had to say something to her about her lack of service, you would have thought she would have figured it out, especially when you are in a service industry working for tips. No situational awareness from the other staff to see the mess at the table and lack of service to our party. Guess they do not have each others back as a team, with no manager watching the floor? WOW! I even had to go ask her for the three checks after all of that. So far the worst dining experience of 2016 for us.

Let me say this though, as I watched the other tables and parties during our experience, I do not believe they were not having these issues, unless they had the same server I would imagine. Maybe they are not equipped to handle parties larger then four people.

Forgot to mention, the appetizers came out with the main course. So much for sitting and enjoying more cocktails during our experience. Hint Hint."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with the husband a couple of weeks ago before we went to a Suns game.  We sat on the patio because the weather was brilliant.  The place is cute and the patio is really very pleasant.  

I ordered a Zombie and a Painkiller cocktail (don't judge, I was rocking a migraine and desperately needed relief), and each one was nice and potent.  My husband just had iced tea.  

I searched the menu for something with shrimp in it, but I was seriously left wanting in that department.  Instead I ordered a starter of lobster bisque and another starter of tuna ceviche.  The soup was hot and quite flavorful, but I would have liked a few more pieces of lobster meat.  The ceviche was extremely good and was served with flash fried wonton 'chips'.  I really liked it and my only criticism was that it was the lime juice was overpoweringly tangy and it could have benefitted from some avocado chunks to help cut down the tang a little bit.

My husband had the black bean burger which he said was really, really delicious.

All in all it was a good visit, and aside from our server not refilling our drinks in a very timely manner it was a good dinner out and I expect we'll be back."}
{"text":"Placed a big order for lunch today and everything was perfect. Some of my coworkers complained that the steak and ahi was not cooked properly. If you don't like pink then I suggest you specifically ask when ordering. Had the chicken bowl it was delicious. Also took a bite of the steak sandwich and it was perfect!  I have also been there for happy hour and they have great specials, even on weekends"}
{"text":"Yikes. This place isn't like a tiki at all. I came excited for the drinks (guilty), but left with the realization that the drinks are the only thing worth getting here. Which is pretty sad. And the drinks don't really have a tiki feel to them--they merely serve as alcoholic beverages. This all ruins the purpose of a tiki, at least for me.

For food, our table ordered a wide variety, including ceviche, the hula burger, shrimp tacos, and a salad. While I try to be nice about my reviews, this place had zero good food. 

This was all made intolerable by the fact that a woman bringing out the food kept leaning over my friend to serve and hand things to one of my other friends seated right next to him. This was all very awkward to look at and we were all confused as to whether she was intentionally ruining group conversation. All she had to do was walk past that friend and hand the food to the specific person, but she kept--literally--leaning over another person. There was nothing in the way, folks, just a mere three steps would have done the job. Wack."}
{"text":"Hula's did not disappoint me on my most recent visit.  Oh - and being they were open later than almost everything in Phoenix on January 2 - they were a life saver. 

I ordered a Hula burger with sweet potato fries (natch). It was perfectly cooked to temp. 

Yes, I had one Dr. Funk for old times' sake. I rarely drink these days (a few times over the last couple years), but I could not resist. It was just as delicious as I remembered. 

The waitress sat my friend and I in a corner of the restaurant, which was fine for conversation.  She was friendly and available without being bothersome. 

My friend had the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them. 

Overall, I had a great meal.  

I think I will visit again with my fiancé when he is in town!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have yet another awesome hot-spot added to the Phoenix restaurant scene.  I've been watching the renovations of this building for a while now and read the blog of all the fantastic things they have done inside the place, so I was waiting at the door 10 minutes before they opened.  Needless to say, I was pumped to finally eat here.

We were welcomed in a little bit before open time by Dana, the owner, who is a really awesome guy and his enthusiasm and excitement is truly infectious.  You can tell that this is his baby and he is so proud.  We were given menus which are minimized for the time being, but there are still a ton of stellar selections on there.

For a starter we chose the sweet potato fries and they were excellent.  They were not too sweet and had a fantastic texture.  Crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside made for a pretty addictive pre meal snack.  Next up was the ceviche, which was actually brought out complimentary by the chef.  I've never had ceviche before, but if this is what it all tastes like, I love it!  The fish was lovely and had a nice firm texture and the spices/peppers added a great bold flavor while the coconut milk mellowed it out a bit.  My dinner entree was the Cocojoe's Coconut Chicken Plate and it was delicious!  There were two huge, flattened pieces of chicken totally covered and crusted in coconut.  It was also slightly covered in a deliciously spicy and slightly sweet lilikoi sauce.  I loved it, but my husband loved it more, so I let him have it and I traded him.  Now I had the pork plate which was also delicious.  The pork was tender and the pineapple/soy bbq type sauce was addictive!  There were also chunks of pineapple which was a nice addition.  The coleslaw it came with was actually a great stand-alone side.  It had a tangy buttermilk base with just the right amount of pepper.  For dessert we got the key lime pie.  It was amazing.  It was so tangy, smooth, and creamy.  It was simply unbelievable, and unlike any key lime pie you have ever had.

I adore this place.  I'm truly in love.  I will be back here many many times.  I cannot wait till the weather is perfect for relaxing on the patio and sitting around the really cool firepit.  Obviously, I was impressed with this place.  The architecture and reuse of the building is wonderful.  The laid back/island atmosphere of this restaurant is a true winner that will be bringing in the people for a very long time."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good Polynesian style restaurant in the Phoenix area as my wife enjoys one back in Connecticut, where she is from. We were looking for a good scorpion bowl, and we found one here! The scorpion bowl is excellent and I would recommend people to try it. The reason for the lower rating is the food. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich and wanted to try the Hawaiian Macaroni Salad. She asked the waitress about it and was told that this was homemade and tasted sweeter than a regular one and was very good. The salad we received tasted like it was bought from a grocery store. The only way we made it different was to use the sauce from her pork on it, which then gave it a good flavor. Otherwise you can get the same thing from Safeway.  The pulled pork was good as were the sweet potato fries. We may go back again, but would not order the Hawaiian Macaroni Salad."}
{"text":"I had high hope that this place is super awesome! Everyone was talking it up and said how great and wonderful the food was. Hmmm...it was just average. 

We had a party of 9 and more than a few items on the appetizer menu ran out. I ordered a Hawaiian white fish Ceviche. It was so soar I couldn't finish the whole fish. My friend ordered a mahi mahi. The fish tastes very well but he didn't like the sauce that goes with it. With that said, the server brought out another one with no sauce in it.

I asked around all of my foodie friends. No one seems to complain about the food but didn't exactly like it either. I still want to give it 3 stars due to great customer service. Other than that I probably will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Update: I was contacted by Dana about my review and he encouraged us to give it another shot. The service this time was significantly better and the food was very good. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"i'm a fan. the Hurricanes did a good job of putting a smile on my face, and during happy hour, 4 hurricanes and the shrimp spring roll was only 25$

so happy hour yes. dinner probably not. 

i have loved this building since i was a child. so i'm happy it's still around and not returned to the ground, in rubble."}
{"text":"Mildly disappointing overall, based on one dinner visit and the high expectations I came in with from Yelp.  

For a fish dominated menu, the aquatic entrees the six of us had were generally pretty boring.  Smallish filets, surprisingly dull sides. Fish apps were up and down. 

Everything else was A-OK.  Good ambience. The owner smiled and made some small talk.  Our server was decent ( and drop dead gorgeous). Potables were potent - I gleefully endorse the Dark & Stormy, a rum and ginger beer concoction.  

I just wish the food was a little more passionate."}
