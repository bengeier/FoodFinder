{"text":"Very disappointed at this location... worst experience ever at Ichiban Hibachi... 

I made a reservation, but was only told to wait when I arrived. They didn't ask me anything about reservation details. When I said I had made a reservation, they told me that I still had to wait with no explanation. It seemed like there's no difference making a reservation or not. 

It took a long time for the chef to come after seated... like another 20 min waiting... 

The hibachi table was not as clean as I expected even though this location was new... Besides, the food was salty... all the people at our table agreed on that and we all felt quite disappointed...

I've been to other Ichiban Hibachi locations... way much better... 

Hope they can improve their service and food quality in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of the best I have visited.  I have eaten at many of these restaurants all over the country and this is my favorite 
Whether you are there for dinner or just a quick lunch you will enjoy this restaurant.  It is clean, fresh food and friendly wait staff.  I have tried a few of the menu items and all were done to perfection"}
{"text":"best hibachi steakhouse.in pit. food was delicious , people were friendly, and tried the sushi everthing came out fresh. great experience"}
{"text":"This is a well decorated, new and clean restaurant. It's in a strip mall, but it's well appointed. 

We are here on a Friday night and there isn't a wait at the sushi bar. Growing up in Pittsburgh, I understand that there isn't much class here. If it's not fried or Italian, they don't eat it. 

The Hibachi tables had activity and were a bit busy. There's my fried hypothesis becoming a theorem. 

The sashimi and the spicy tuna roll were very good and tasted very fresh. They also did a nice job with presentation. 

We ordered a couple of specialty rolls, as well. We were unimpressed with the Ichiban roll and the Avalanche roll. Both rolls were not tasty. They were smothered in sauces. We didn't finish either roll. 

So, keep it simple and stick with the basics. 

The staff was friendly, but we didn't have a designated server. 5 people waited on us. There wasn't a smooth coordination, but they weren't busy....It wast a big issue. 

I won't even comment on the lack of valet parking. I can count on one hand how many places have it, in Pittsburgh. 

I would recommend this restaurant. 

Overall Grade: 83 out of 100"}
{"text":"We were there this past weekend, we had hibachi and sushi both were very good. Good bang for your buck, very large portions plus it taste amazing, i frequent here as it is close to home. both the wife and I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar as well. always have had a great experience here and great food"}
{"text":"One of the best hibachi and sushi I've ever had in Pittsburgh. They have other locations too. Perfect place to take a family to with fun hibachi shows."}
{"text":"This place was so reliable, but all has gone down hill! Wifey and I would venture to this restaurant about once maybe twice a month, and always go with the all-you-can-eat sushi and sashimi. The last few times we went we had an awful rice-to-fish ratio with the sushi rolls, which was more annoying than anything. More importantly, we had different fish that was definitely past it's prime; ahi tuna was bad, unagi eel was super fishy, shrimp no bueno, yellowtail no sir-e-bob. This review stemmed from about five reviews over the last three months. We are done with this restaurant, and never go back. Little Tokyo in Mt Lebanon is where we will go from now on."}
{"text":"Went to the new Washington location. Sushi was slimy, very gross compared to Fusion across the street. Wife ordered emperor combo of steak and scallops with fried rice and vegetables. Everything was soggy and drowned in soy sauce, so salty it was almost inedible. Manager refused to refund the combo even though it was almost entirely uneaten. Will NEVER return. Fusion has better food, better service, and higher quality standards in general for the same price. Avoid the Washington Ichiban at all cost."}
{"text":"Went to Ichiban with my parents and husband for some fun teppanyaki. I've been to several places like this throughout the years, and I though the food and the show was excellent! The fried rice and noodles are delicious, and I left with enough for three more meals after (though I am a fairly light eater). Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon, but will be back. Everyone was 100% professional and polite, the hibachi table was clean and nice. I got the scallops and chicken combo and my friend got the chicken and shrimp combo. Watching the cook add all the wonderful flavors was a treat (fresh lemon and sesame seeds were some add flavors). The noodles and rice were great too-SO MUCH FOOD! It was entertaining too!"}
{"text":"If I could give negatives I would ....I will Never EVER come back here again as long as I have a choice. My wife and I were here on Friday around 7pm. We were seated promptly and that was the last prompt thing about the experience, our waiter or waitress or whomever was supposed to be waiting on us which I still don't know didn't come to even get us drinks til after we sat there for 20 mins. ALL of the people around us had problems with their food or drinks ....I heard the lady at the table behind us say her food was undercooked, the couple across from us their food and drinks were wrong twice, another couple 2 seats up from us got served someone else's food. Our food which I didn't really get anything because you CANNOT get any sort of Hibachi style food unless you sit at the Hibachi. I know at Saga you can still get Hibachi food at a regular table, sometimes people just don't want all the BS to go with the food. It is the most unprofessional place I have ever been ....you cant substitute stuff on a lot of orders ....its just a mess and I strongly advise anyone read the menu online before going so you aren't stuck with being hungry like I was."}
{"text":"Love their rolls!! Best in the burgh. Every Friday night I order from them. Their rolls are all delicious and filling. Loyal customer here!"}
{"text":"The Chef was fun! He was very outgoing and went out of his way to create conversation and show new teppanyaki tricks. The service was bad tho-we asked for to go boxes a couple of times, until eventually we got the boxes ourselves, and wrapped our own food. The table stayed dirty for about 20 min still, the server was just standing in the front of the empty restaurant, talking and hanging out. So we bussed all of the dishes enough, so that we could take our family photos. The Chef was awesome tho. You could def tell he enjoyed his job!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time on my hubbys birthday. We enjoyed the show and really liked the rice and noodles. I didn't care for the shrimp..it was over cooked in my opinion. Chicken was a little overlooked too. Taste was good though. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem!  Went with a co-worker and we just sat at that sushi bar since we were only there for sushi.  While we waited, the sushi chef gave us an appetizer on the house.  The miso soup was excellent and the staff was very attentive.  The sushi was very good and fresh.  The presentation was better than i have seen at alot of places recently.  All of the food was fantastic.  We had soups, a sashimi platter, 3 rolls of various types, and drinks all for $50.  An absolute deal!  I will definitely be going back to this place when I am back in town."}
{"text":"The sushi is simply the best in western PA. Hands down. We've tried them all and this place puts them to shame. Seriously, better then Nakama, better then Little Tokyo. ONLY complaint is the music... Air Supply??? Really???"}
{"text":"Sat at a dine -in / non hibachi table and food took forever.  Our server was nowhere to be found, So I asked the bartender for Splenda ( which apparently they don't use ) and she was rather rude, like she couldn't be bothered.  Will be a long time before I come back here"}
{"text":"Had a great meal food tasted great service good waitress kept the drink filled to the top. Cook had a great personality and put on a good show . The other family that join our table was good company also . All around a good meal !"}
{"text":"Ordered in the regular dining area, non Hibachi. Had the teriyaki steak and scallops. Both a little tough but well flavored. You can order Hibachi dine-in as well (Mrs. Reviewer had Hibachi chicken). There didn't seem to be a meaningful difference between the teriyaki and Hibachi dishes. Both had huge portions including the grilled veggies. Regular drink specials including $2 Yuengling drafts. Service was brisk and fine. Dinner and drinks for 2 came to a reasonable $50 plus tip."}
{"text":"First time back since they remodeled.  Looks great.    Food was top notch.   There service was excellent.   The portions were so big that I had to get a to go container.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This is one of the best ichibans I have been too. They were clean and very organized. The chef was great at the hibachi table and the waiter was also great. The food was cooked very well and the portions were very big for being lunch. 5 Stars!!"}
