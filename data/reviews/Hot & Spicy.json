{"text":"CLOSED - As of August 2011 :(.  They now have a location in Laval.  -------  This is definitely one of the best Chinese food place in Montreal.  The decor is nice but one goes there for the food. Like most other restaurants, you get the best dishes at night. They have combo menus at lunch time which will usually have one or two good picks. The rest is mediocre.  At night, you can either get à la carte dishes (pricey) or the $25 (if the price hasn't gone up) all you can eat menu.  The first plates you order come quickly (well the first 3 or 4). The other ones however will take a very very long time to get to your table (over 25 min. wait is not uncommon). This happened every single time (at least 4 that I can remember) that I have been there at night. Hence, I'm pretty sure it's their way to minimize how much food the patrons will eat with this option. The food that does come however is all delicious. My favorite is always the salt and pepper shrimps."}
{"text":"Moi, j'aime Hot& Spicy!  J'ai été très heureux que cela sert la bonne bouffe! Vivant en Californie, j'ai goûté beaucoup de plats épicés et cet endroit était merveilleux!  Si vous vous trouvez à Laval et à la recherche d'une grande expérience, n'hésitez pas à visiter!"}
{"text":"Am I the only one who thinks these hot and spicy restaurants are seriously overrated?  I have always been from the school of thought that nothing good ever comes in an all you can eat format. I don't care if it's a Chinese buffet, Vichy, La Stanza, or the Pizza Hut lunch buffet!   The food is just okay. But the wine is 3 - 3.5 times the SAQ prices! Seriously!!! Who wants to pay $43 for a $13 bottle? It's flat-out insulting."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Hot & Spicy 3 times a year for the last 10 years. A great place to have a meal with a group of people. Tables for 8-10 people are round and have mini-tables in the center, a cool feeling when the table if full of yummy stuff.   Pros :  - Over what... 100 items to order now? The menu keeps expanding every year and the food is delicious. There's something for everyone. Personal favorites are the General Tao, Sesame Beef and Hunan Dumplings.  - Nice atmosphere that embraces the Asian culture.  - Recently have added sushi to the menu.    Cons :  - The service is usually lamentable. While they are somewhat friendly, they rarely speak their mind and the service can be incredibly slow. Feels like they are purposely slowing the service so that they don't have to serve everything ordered and fill you up with the cheaper stuff as you wait while you're hungry. Can be exceedingly annoying to wait at times 30+ minutes for the first few entrees.  - Sometimes the plates can be hit or miss. You'll go there for one dinner and have fantastic General Tao and the next time you go... it'll be mediocre.... but you won't really care since you can sometimes go through 20-30 different plates of food with a large group sampling all kinds of great finds.   Overall, an excellent meal for $30. The coffee, fortune cookies and ice cream is just the icing on the cake. However, beware of the slow service during busy hours and make sure they serve you the good stuff early."}

{"text":"Had lunch here again with a work colleague as this is his favorite place! The have a great selection on their menu and quality and consistency is always excellent! Whenever I come here I always eat a small dinner that evening as its \"fatman\" size portions. Usually lunch with just water costs $16-17 with tax and tip. A tad more on the expensive side, but I believe quality to be much higher than Manchu wok or any of the mall Asian joints! Also it's not grand central station \"busy\" while you eating! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's like a regular Chinese «All you can eat» but with a bit more chick 1) you don't get up, you order some portion of the 100+ items MENU! 2) You wait 5 minutes and get some fresh portion, no heating stuff that has been in the pan for 30-45 minutes. 3) You can re-order  It's 29.99$ (34.95$ + 5.25$ tip) for some really decent asian food. The place is beautiful, really clean. It's a large restaurant,  so you don't need any reservation. The background music is not really loud, jazzy, blues lounge.  Try: Sea Salt fried shrimps        Pekin Duck        Sea salt Quails        General Tao        Sesame Beef.        Genghis Khan Sheep  Those are pretty good stuff, but enjoy! you'll have a good time"}
