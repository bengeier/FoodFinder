{"text":"Had the seasonal beef shank sandwich - really good - I'll be back to try other things"}
{"text":"This place is better then you can imagine. One of the best places to get food in Pittsburgh, bar none."}
{"text":"Very good. Got the poached egg sandwich, with roasted cauliflower, pea shoots, parmesan, served on a brioche. Very good, though I would've liked a dash of spice to add some complexity to the flavor.

Legitimately very friendly counter staff, which is *always* appreciated. Really good music playing, too! A nice little shop with good, freshly made food, at reasonable prices. Haven't sampled the homemade seltzers but I'm looking forward to doing so the next time around. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love all sandwiches. Lucy in the strip will always be my #1, but these guys come in at a close second. Every sandwich has been a heavenly medley- both completely satisfying and oddly refreshing. 

That duck pork sausage is so awesomely sinful and the original thin man is unforgettable. They know their competition though and rumor has it they'll trade you any one of their sandwiches for one of Lucy's. 

Now I have the ultimate first world problem of choosing between Lucy's, Thin Man, Chicken Latino, and Reyna's when I visit that corner of the strip."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least a dozen times.  The creativity and execution of the food here is incredible.  Sure, some of the sandwiches are a bit experimental and not for everyone, but they're always well executed and interesting in their own ways.  The menu changes constantly which is also a plus.  The Bastardo is a great breakfast/lunch sandwich with ham, an over easy egg, and soft focaccia bread. It all comes together amazingly... especially if you add bacon.  The meat has always been cooked perfectly, and the additional ingredients are always really well suited to the sandwich.  Not to mention the different breads... they're always a great match to the ingredients inside.  Just today I had a pork sandwich which had the most wonderfully cooked pork medallions.  They could have easily been served at a fine dining restaurant with a side for over $30.  It's rare to find a place with the experimental mentality and quality cooking of a fine dining establishment mixed with the low price point and casual atmosphere of a sandwich shop.  Thin Man pulls it off amazingly well and it's definitely a choice stop for anyone looking for a quality sandwich.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to order food bc the staff and woman who picked up the phone was more concerned with having an attitude than being a decent employee. Automatically was rude and disrespectful and had no real initiative to make sure the customer was taken care of.
Because of her and her attitude I did not get to try the sandwich that I was actually pretty excited to try; the Amish Turkey Sandwich.
Still really want to try this place but employees like that ruin business and detour people from trying them on their free time"}
{"text":"This is a high quality sandwich shop. The sandwiches are a bit small and somewhat pricey, but it's worth a trip. I was in a group of five and we all tried each other's sandwiches. Pretty much everything was good.

I got the Thin Man--a simple sandwich with just four ingredients. It was salty and excellent.

Pro tip: they grill the chicken breasts to order, and make sure you get something with one of the sauces or spreads."}
{"text":"So great! Takes a \"normal sandwich\" and adds such a great combination of flavors that you can't help but leave smiling. Staff is wonderful; everything made in house. Can't wait to return!

Hint:  try the smash and the beet soda!"}
{"text":"Yum. If you're hungry, go here. As mentioned, the name comes from the owners' love of old movies.
This shop is owned and run by a husband-wife team, and they are wonderfully friendly and helpful. We got the braised grass-fed beef sandwich and it was delicious! My only complaint was the bun it came on, very un-flavorful white bread, but at least it was toasted; and the menu probably said white bread I just didn't read it carefully enough! The menu is filled with local food or ethically raised food--the wife said their goal was to bring their background of fine dining to a cafe setting. Success!
Anyway, I will go back, which is why there's four stars. For the type of sandwich shop it is, it's pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this joint out for a while. Allow me to say it did not disappoint in the slightest. Came here with two buddies a little after 6 o'clock to be greeted a friendly woman at the counter who said she'd be happy to answer any questions that we may have. Let me also say that I will most likely have an easier time choosing the name of my first born son than I had deciding what I wanted my first sandwich from thin man to be. I ended up picking the smash and it was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of avocado but this just really worked. The Amish chicken and il bastardo looked outstanding as well. I was so impressed with my meal I almost ordered a second sandwich to go. (My one friend did.) They also have a nice selection of sides such as the jalape√±o cornbread and home made seltzers. Bottom line is you should check this place out. Amazing food quick service and fair prices. Will one hundred percent be returning for more."}
{"text":"Really fabulous sandwiches! Fresh, local, full of flavor... Love. I'm a bit obsessed with The Smash chicken sandwich! The picked green onions are amazing. Now if they'd only serve diet coke..."}
{"text":"The Thin Man Sandwich is amazing and worth the trip alone but the sides and soup were also very good. Service was friendly and fast.  Can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to the Thin Man Sandwich Shop.  I've been eagerly waiting for this place to open after I read an article about it (I can't remember where?) and it was definitely worth the wait.  

I came here on a Saturday afternoon with my parents who happened to be in town for the day.  Inside, the place is decorated in white and red and is a bit tight.  Lucky, they have additional lofted seating upstairs.  I ordered the Thin Man with a pumpkin soup and my parents ordered the Red Curry Hummus and the Albacore Tuna with another side of the pumpkin soup.   It only took a bite or two before all of us fell in love with this place.  Everything was so delicious.  The Thin Man (Chicken Liver Mousse, Bacon, Frisee, Red Wine Vinaigrette, on a Baguette) is definitely one of the most creative delicious sandwiches that I have in Pittsburgh and I am a complete sandwich addict.  The soup, which contained Wigle Whiskey from the distillery right up the street, was also bangin'.  Incorporating both bacon and whiskey, two of my favorite ingredients/things in the world, in one meal?  I'm a happy camper.  My only regret is that I didn't sample any of the infused Pittsburgh Seltzer Works beverages.  No worries, with reasonable prices and delicious food I know I'll find myself back here very soon to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We had sandwiches from here not too long ago.  The combinations sounds really interesting and appetizing, but the results did not live up to my expecations.  The sanwhiches I've had there lacked real flavor and were overpriced.  There are many better options in the Strip."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in Pittsburgh.  The staff is very kind and very creative with their use of ingredients.  The sandwiches are filling but not huge."}
{"text":"Dan and Sherri are fantastic cooks!! artickhoke meatball--oyster--smash-- cabbage potato.... all of them--every single sandwich in their chalkboard!!! Also their hummus is so fresh-so good! I would pay double price for what they serve and wait in line to eat eat there. Plus very humble beautiful people working there, the register Rachel is very kind. Try it, you will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in Pittsburgh.

They offer a great variety of made to order sandwiches filled with fresh and novel ingredients.

So far, I have had the Smash, the Thin Man, and the Kobi Beef seasonal.  I've been pleased every time.

The great customer service and quality product have been consistent every visit.  So happy to have this gem so close to my apartment!"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch in Pittsburgh. Convenient location in the Strip District as well. Service was very fast and friendly.
The chefs are the ones actually making your sandwiches, not some min-wage teen.
I had the beef shank as it didn't seem like much of a risk, and I was very pleased. The baguette was soft enough with a crispy outside, the horseradish and mustard accented the sandwich well and did not overpower the other flavors.

Out of curiousity, I tried my friend's chicken liver mousse \"Thin Man\", and found it to be quite accessible/tasty considering I've never had chicken liver before. The texture (which might turn some people off) takes a back seat to the bacon and frisee for an all around great sandwich.

I will return."}
{"text":"Tried thin man for the first time yesterday and would say it was good. I had the smash which was pretty tasty w fresh sprouts and avocado. Also had some pozole. Which I'm super picky about my Mexican food and the flavors were spot on. I was impressed. However my dining partner got the spinach salad which was lacking. It had mangos and cashews but left you wanting. Was a tad too simple. The seating is a little limited b we sat upstairs and had gotten there when they just opened so we didn't have many other customers to compete with. I wasn't feeling a warm and fuzzy from the lady who took our order, they did just open so maybe she was feeling rushed b I didn't get the normal small biz feel of people who actually care. The sandwiches do take a while to be made, so that combined w the luke warm customer service and the little higher prices leave me with 4 stars for thin man. I'll go back but w so many fantastic places to eat in pgh not sure it will become a regular for me."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious sandwiches. We came in on a Saturday to no line, unlike the other restaurants on the street. I enjoyed the black pepper capocolla. As a northeastern lady now living in Texas, I was in heaven with this simple Italian sandwich with sweet pepper relish and smoked provolone. Also love that you can sit upstairs and watch the food be made."}
{"text":"This place should come with a warning that says, \"Just don't fall in love with me\", at least on the rotating menu of sandwiches. Just as soon as you find a sandwich you can't live without, it rotates off the menu. Fortunately, everything is good, so you can fall in love all over again. 

To have the best experience, be a little adventurous and come in with the expectation that this is not your average sandwich shop. The staff is friendly and the service is moderately quick for them whipping up these sandwiches from scratch. Also, the sweet ginger seltzer is their best beverage for my money."}
{"text":"Thin man serves really good sandwiches made to order in their open kitchen as you wait and watch. 

 I really enjoy their signature sandwich, \"the thin man\", which has chicken liver mousse, bacon, and greens with a wine vinaigrette served on a toasted baguette.  The chicken liver mouse combined with bacon was deliciously rich in flavor without being too heavy. The prices were very reasonable (sandwiches ranged from 7-9 dollars).  They also had a nice selection of side dishes.

If you are looking for fresh, innovative, lip-smackingly good, affordable food, this place is a must try.  Of note, as the sandwiches do take 10-15 minutes to make from time to order, so come prepared...they are well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place in the Strip.... And I say that as a life long Primanti's aficionado.  Sandwichs that you can't find anywhere else with ingredients that I've never encountered before.  All absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets, and is setting the bar higher for the rest of the Strip. Everything is fresh, always, and the recipes are considered and nuanced, but still very approachable versions of street food from around the world. 

I'm a bigger guy, and I can put away the groceries. So you know when I am eating slowly, it's really good. The Thin Man is just plain delicious."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. 
I am a vegetarian who has grown used to eating bland options from a limited list. Thin Man however, offers veggie options that feel just as considered and special as everything else on the menu. 
The Swiss chard sandwich is so unusual and varied in its flavours. Served on a delicious baguette, tahini, almonds - yummmm. I had every intention of saving half each of the four times I ate here, but alas its too damn tasty to stop. 
I also had the grilled ricotta sandwich served on wheat bread, with white bean spread, pea sprouts and pickled turnip. Such a wonderful combination of flavours - I would eat this everyday. My husband visits daily and loves the Indian butter chicken, and the saut√©ed beef.
Dan, Sherri and their staff are so friendly. You haven't been to Pittsburgh if you haven't eaten at Thin Man"}
{"text":"I've never had a sandwich short of phenomenal here.  Staff are awesome, too.  Order anything, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"So I unexpectedly found myself in Pittsburgh in May and kind of fell in love with the city. Aside from all the cool bridges, fun murals and neighborhoods built into lush hillsides, Pittsburgh has amazing food. A bartender recommended Thin Man Sandwich Shop and my Pittsburgh love was only increased ten-fold. The menu is interesting without being too weird to be enticing. The sandwiches are made fresh and the bread is delicious. I had a seasonal chicken meatball sandwich on a baguette and it was the perfect blend of delicious. I also had their in-house flavored seltzer - very refreshing on a hot day!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop in here, I really enjoyed my experience and will be coming back here soon! I came here for a lunch and didn't know what to order since everything looked so good. I went with their namesake sandwich...The THIN MAN. 

That was a heck of a good samich. I will warn you thought that it is definitely a rich and savory bite. The chicken liver mousse was what made it very rich and I loved the hunks of bacon. I mean you really can't beat a sandwich with a healthy dose of bacon. Everything is cooked before your eyes and I came here right at the lunch rush and let me tell you it was entertaining to watch the two chefs cranking out samichs. I don't know how those two kept everything straight with orders."}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I keep wanting to go back and try them all. Their signature thin man sandwich is a thing of beauty. 

I dream about these sandwiches in my sleep."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop lived up to the all the social media buzz leading up to its big opening.  I wish it was in my neighborhood, but also I'm glad it's not because I'd spend too many dollars and calories here.  The lamb kofta pita was perfection and had all my favorite flavors like cilantro, creamy tomato sauce and jalapenos.  And the red curry hummus was exactly as delicious as it sounds.  I'll be back to try more.  I think an inventive non french-fry stuffing sandwich place is exactly what the strip needed."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches. The duck egg sandwhich is particularly good. They also have Mexican coke, which is a big plus. It was quiet when I went there, but I imagine they would be space-challenged at times."}
{"text":"Best sandwich spot in Pittsburgh. The Thin Man is a  terrific sandwich. They always have solid and interesting sides, like the potato pancakes. And their homemade seltzers are amazingly refreshing. 

I will say that I have tried a number of sandwiches here and they all have been good. But none of them
Ever compare to the thin man--maybe I am a just a sucker for pate!"}
{"text":"After another visit to the TMSS, I've dropped my rating.

There are two reasons for it:

1. The Smash, which is a signature sandwich from them, is relatively boring and just not that good.  It's a chicken sandwich.....and when all said and done, it's just not great. It's ok.  I can get similar food closer and cheaper.

2. The cashier thought it was appropriate to adjust her radio in the middle of lunch rush(12:15pm) instead of taking orders while a half-dozen customers waited for her.  This is a bigger indication that she cares more about herself than serving her guests. No sense of urgency.

I find it interesting that the Mexican stand outside of Reyna's next door was anxiously trying to take orders from people. I bet THEY weren't trying to adjust their radios.

What's the difference?  TMSS shouldn't rest on their laurels --- they are only as good as their last service.

The sweet and sour pork was very good."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get here for quite some time, and it's a tall order to get me to not go to Peppi's if I'm in the Strip District. But today, I went with a purpose. As I did on Monday before I realized they were closed.

I didn't review the menu in detail, and opted to just start off with the Thin Man. Can't say I've ever had chicken liver mousse (maybe on a Banh mi sandwich), and certainly not as the highlight of the sandwich.

It was earthy, with a nice crispy bacon, and a wonderfully dressed endive mix with red wine vinegar. The sandwich size was reasonable for the price, about 7-8\" and incredibly crispy.

The sandwich alone was 4-5 stars. I could've swung them down to 3 as the entire staff seemed to not care about any of the guests presence. The cashier in particular scoffed when I asked if they had chips as a side, so I stuck with just the sandwich (to go).

I'll definitely be back to try some of the other options, but a note to the staff, perk up a bit!"}
{"text":"I was wandering around the strip one day starving and wanting something different than the usual delicious food I get in the strip. As I walked past thin man's sandwitch shop I remembered reading a pittsburgh magazine that praised the shop for using local organic ingredients and having amazing gourmet sandwiches so in I went. 

I asked them what they recommended I try and they were all unanimous about the sandwitch I should order. I don't remember what it was called but it had meat and pesto. That's all I can really remember because the sandwitch was so delicious it was gone in the blink of an eye! I looked around to see what everyone else was eating and all of the food looked incredible. Every single sandwitch being eaten could have been on a commercial for Thin Man's Sandwitch Shop! I thought about ordering another one but remembered how close I was to peace love and little donuts! Great little sandwitch shop that surely puts most others to shame!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in to the Thin Man Sandwich Shop last Saturday while exploring the Strip and I am so glad we did.  At first glance, the sandwich board looks a little weird and expensive, but the sandwich creations are so worth the price.  I enjoyed the beef short ribs and pork belly sandwich.  There was just enough horseradish on the sandwich and it was over-flowing with beef and pork yumminess.  The cous-cous quinoa side was sweet and delicious and the German potato salad was vinegary without being in your face.  I also tried the sweet ginger seltzer which was not overly sweet or too gingery.  I loved how refreshing it was.  We will definitely go back and I highly recommend checking this place out.  Get off the beaten path, avoid the lines at the more traditional Strip eateries and try the Thin Man!"}
{"text":"I work in the strip and eat here often. I'm a vegetarian and as a vegetarian one of the things I miss most is sandwiches but they always have something delicious on their menu for us veggie people so I can finally enjoy a good sandwich. They are always changing their menu so nothing ever gets old. I highly recommend this place, it's a nice change from your normal pizza or sub shop."}
{"text":"Overpriced small forgettable turkey sandwich with unpleasant slow service.  Many much better places to eat nearby"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a quick lunch. I probably didn't order the right thing. I got the \"local ham.\" It was regular ham, havarti cheese, arugula, and some seasoned mayo. It was served on dry white toasted bread. I also ordered the local peach seltzer. The sandwich and the selter were good. I'm not sure if it was worth the $12 I paid for it. I could have made a similar meal at home. 

The menu is a bit confusing. I would use less flowery vocab and stick to the basics."}
{"text":"I don't know what's more welcoming, the completely seemingly original menu or the extremely polite staff. 

I had a beef sandwich that was reminiscent of some amazing beef roast I had at some point in an amazing bun. If you're looking for a unique sandwich experience that doesn't end in napping...this might be your spot."}
{"text":"Visiting Pitt and stumbled on to this place.  Lucky break for me.  Had the signature sandwich and really enjoyed it.  The flavor combos were great, all the ingredients were fresh and it was built on a very good foundation: a fresh, flakey baguette.  By the way, great value."}
{"text":"Really happy this place is finally open. The biggest problem with the menu is that you can't order everything. When gourmet chefs open a sandwich shop, everyone wins.

My girlfriend and I shared the Bastardo and a Beef Shank sandwich. The Bastardo was awesome, the drippy egg added so much. The Beef was also quite good, the combination of fennel, celery, and whole grain mustard was perfect on an already delicious portion of beefy goodness. We also split two sides- truffle lentils and the potatoes. Both were great, I can't think of any sandwich shop that will roast potatoes for you, it's a nice departure from the ubiquitous truffle fry. Speaking of truffle, the lentils are awesome, made with bits of bacon I could have eaten a bucket full.

The sandwiches were so good, despite my better judgement, I ordered a third, the lamb pita. This one was packed with piping hot lamb meatballs, it has some spice with fresh jalapenos, but was countered nicely with some cilantro.

We washed it all down with two of their house infusion drinks, I had lingonberry and she had ginger. Delish!

Bottom line, eat here. I'm going back asap to finish off the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"First class sandwich shop. The thin man sandwich is a unique adventure. Decor is very cool. Nice second story seating"}
{"text":"Roasted cauliflower and shrimp sandwich, crispy pepper polenta, and a great selection of sodas to boot...  a great finish to our obligatory monthly strip district meandering.

I had been wanting to try Thin Man following the glowing reviews and press it was getting, but ultimately, Gaucho stole me first.  No worries!

Thin man represents everything that is great about the Pittsburgh food renaissance.  Hard working and caring owners, a dedicated staff, innovative offerings, and commitment to quality.  Definitely has a retro-neuvo mixed feel to the dinning room (limited stools against the glass available for seating, but there is additional seating upstairs).

Will. be. back."}
{"text":"Perhaps the most underrated place in the Strip (even at four stars). You can tell that making sandwiches is more than a job to these folks. There is love in this food. Every season there are new, weird sandwiches--and I've never been let down by any of them!"}
{"text":"The menu is crazy! Some one else wrote it is what Pittsburgh needs and they are correct. I went with the signature sandwich that was the Chicken Liver Mouse on a beget. The sandwich was good mouse was very creamy and the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was done perfect also. Just not my favorite combo. Every ones taste are different. My chef friend who I was with loved it. Also we had the garlic Potato and the were cooked to order and were tasty as well. We also had some the Parsnip and Potato soup which was very creamy and had a good flavor. I would go back again but I would try another sandwich."}
{"text":"If you are into pickles and pickled flavored things. Then this place is for you!! I often eat salads and just need to put more and more vinegar on it to get that face tweaking twang I have come to need. This is the only place in the state where I can purchase a salad that meets my needs! We are talking pickled lettuce, pickled green beans, pickled plates, pickled seltzer. The sandwiches are okay."}
{"text":"The bread is really good and the sandwiches are fantastic!

My favorite is the Thin man. It has chicken liver mousse and bacon on it so it is very salty but I love that about the sandwich! 

The smash is a good compliment sandwich for your partner to order and you can swap a half each. The smash has avocado which is definitely a fan favorite in my house hold. 

They have a bunch of cool soda drinks that I have never tried as I am not a huge soda fan."}
{"text":"Probably the most unique sandwiches you will find in Pittsburgh. They are always rotating the seasonal menu, and it often features quite unusual things. For example, I had a sandwich with mussels in it last week! There are plenty of veggie and meat options.

Delicious.

Also make sure to try the appetizers and seltzer."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  The Thin Man is not at all like a chain.  The owners are fans of Thin Man Television/Film series.  They serve delicious gourmet sandwiches, and the shop has a real neighborhood feel to it.  I saw several regulars enter the restaurant and  they were all greeted warmly.  I ordered The Smash, and I will probably order it again, it was so tasty.  Goat Milk Marinated Chicken Breast, Avocado, Alfalfa, Lemon Pickled Green Onion, on a Multigrain Baguette."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had the shaved beef sandwich with snap pea slaw, green garlic and other delicious toppings on it. Hands down the best steak sub I've ever had. The slaw made it so so good and the bread was so yummy! I discovered this on my bike route and I am soo glad I did. It looks like a regular sub shop from the outside but the menu is definitely different than any other sandwich shop I've been to. Definitely top of the line gourmet sandwiches here. And the price wasn't too bad either. Especially because you are getting fresh, made to order food. And believe me, you can definitely taste the freshness. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"They definitely have some interesting sandwich choices. Chick liver muses, smash.. but we put aside of our prejudices decide to give it a try. Hmmm, they tasted really good. My husband and I usually get one of each so that we both can taste both. 

They have local concerts and other kind of flyers sitting by the entrance for all the customer to check out as they are waiting. 

It is a cool spot and I wish they have another store downtown so that I can add it to my weekday lunch choice list."}
{"text":"Though the name may imply it, the Thin Man Sandwich shop is not a diet sandwich shop serving veggie pitas and bowls of steam. This joint is serving high quality, cheffed out sandwiches that are packed with flavor.

I had the beef shank sandwich with horseradish mayo, whole grain mustard, and shaved fennel and celery. This sandwich was the perfect combo of savory fattiness from the beef shank, sharpness from the mayo and mustard, and crunchy freshness from the fennel and celery salad. Slap all of those great flavors inside a crunchy/chewy Breadworks baguette and you will be in for treat.

My only complaint about this shop is that it the service can be a little slow. I stopped in here on a Saturday morning around 11, there were three other people in the shop, and it took about 10 minutes from when I placed my order to when I received my sandwich. A gentleman came in after me, ordered 1 sandwich to go and it took him about 10 minutes as wells to received his order. I know they just opened and I'm sure they are still working the kinks out. Hopefully the wait time will be cut down in the future. That being said the wait was well worth it, the sandwich rocked."}
{"text":"Walk past this past a million times, I thought I would finally stop to try it, i tell you what , I wish I would of stopped sooner it's very satisfying every bit i took from my sandwich! I will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Relocating from Chicago and had heard I needed to stop by the Strip District.  When I came across the Thin Man Sandwich Shop, I was thrilled.  I had the shaved beef sandwich, couscous special and Sweet Ginger seltzer.  ALL of it was absolutely DELISH...the broccoli slaw on the sandwich added just the right amount of crunch and the dressing added just enough tang to accompany the beef.  I am a bit of a foodie and am happy to know that places like this exist in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today for lunch with my fiance.  I have been wanting to try the thin man sandwich shop ever since I started reading the reviews on Yelp.  Whenever we walked in the first thing that I noticed was the chalkboard menu.  There was also the area behind the counter where they were making the sandwiches and a few seats downstairs at counters looking out the windows.  I also noticed that they had some additional seating upstairs but did not make it up there.  After looking over the menu I asked the girl taking my order if they could substitute some of the bread types with a flatbread or a wrap since my fiance does not eat bread but they could not.  I ended up ordering The Braised Duck Leg.  It consisted of some shredded duck leg, black garlic, a scallion pancake, ginger braised celery on a sesame kaiser while my fianc√© had the everything hummus and split the Mac and cheese with me.  After about a ten minute wait at one of the windows looking out over Smallman Street, our number was called and we received our food.  My sandwich came in what looked like butchers paper and whenever I opened it up I was disappointed in the size of it.  Basically it was the same size sesame kaiser that you would get from McDonalds or Burger King with one of their bigger sandwiches only of better quality.  I will admit that the duck inside of it was delicious as it was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The ginger braised celery was also nice and gave it a little bit of a crunch.   Finally the scallion pancake I could see on the sandwich but I did not think that it added very much.  Overall though I was pleased with the great flavoring and amount of duck for the sandwich size.  After finishing my sandwich I decided to try the hummus which my fiance said she loved.  It was interesting in that along with the chickpea flavor, it really did taste like an everything bagel with the poppy and sesame seeds coming through the most.  Finally the mac and cheese was also pretty good.  It was baked together in the oven and came to us in two little triangles covered with a crispy topping.  The flavoring of it was good and I enjoyed the presentation as well as the topping which I suspect may have been Shake and Bake? 

The bottom line for me is that I may come back here in the future.  The food that I ate itself deserves a five star review as it was good but the $9.50 I paid for my sandwich certainly did not fill me up, not even with some mac and cheese and hummus.  So while the food itself is good I would be prepared to either spend a lot of money or plan to eat a snack elsewhere afterwards which is what I ended up doing."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I didn't start out going to Thin Man Sandwich Shop yesterday.  My local Lawrenceville joint was closed for the weekend and I was taken to Thin Man to pick up lunch.  I'm so happy it worked out that way!  Instead of the same old same old, I got to enjoy the Garlic Roasted Eggplant sandwich.  It had all sorts of good things that I like on it like spinach and pine nuts and a really tasty yogurt sauce.  Oh, and it was on a really fresh baguette.  I was delighted to learn that they make their own infused seltzers.  I tried the sweet ginger.  It was really refreshing and not as sweet as a regular soda which is my preference.  I loved my lunch!  It made me realize that I have to get out of Lawrenceville once in a while and explore a different area.  A great eating experience can occur."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Thin Man Sandwich Shop this past Sat. with a friend.  I'd been wanting to try the sandwiches here for awhile, given how interesting they looked compared to many other local sandwich shops.  Having a City Dining Card gave me the push I needed to finally pay a visit, so I suggested it to my friend, and we decided to try it for lunch.

I ordered the Thin Man sandwich ($7.99), a sandwich with chicken liver mousse, bacon, vinegar, and frisee greens.  In addition to this, I ordered a side of the kale salad ($5.50), as well as the house infused ginger honey soda ($2.79).  My friend ordered the chicken meatball sandwich, which came with bacon and country gravy in addition to the eponymous meatballs ($6.99).  Additionally, she ordered the warm German potato salad ($3.99), and the ginger honey soda.  Both of us enjoyed our sandwiches quite a bit.  I can only speak for mine, but the flavors married together well, and was decently sized (10\").  The sides were good, too.  Caraway seed gave the potato salad some nice additional savory flavor, and vinaigrette dressing made the kale salad sing.  I found the drink refreshing, but my friend didn't enjoy it as much, so YMMV.

While I agree with other reviewers that the price point is a bit higher than I'd like, (1) this is the Strip, so it's to be expected on some level and (2) the local ingredients and creative combinations justify it to some extent, as well.  I didn't notice the customer service being particularly outstanding, but then again, I was there to chat with my friend, not the employees.  Seating is limited, but there are a few tables on the second floor, and I like how Smallman St. is visible from most of the seats.

Overall, I had a good experience at Thin Man, and would return.  I'd rank Thin Man above the likes of Primanti's and Peppi's, but below Gaucho, which is consistently ranked best sandwich in the Burgh.  If I were the owners, I'd have opted to open a shop in Lawrenceville rather than the Strip, given the steep nearby competition from Gaucho, and the hipster demographic of L-ville.  As it were, though, Thin Man is worth a try when in the Strip, so check it out."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a large web footprint, but it was pretty empty when we visited on a gray Tuesday afternoon.

We ordered the Thin Man sandwich, with chicken liver mousse, bacon and endive, and a braised beef sandwich, which may have been a special.

While waiting, I began work on a seltzer flavored with what must have been a dried fig puree or syrup. This was absolutely fantastic.

The meticulous chef who I took to be the owner, made the sandwiches while we waited. 

The sandwiches are right sized, not too large, not too small, perfect texture on the bun.

Had we just had the savory Thin Man, I might have said five stars, on the strength of its uniqueness  and that fantastic soda. The problem was that we had also purchased sandwiches from Gaucho for the long road trip, and their meaty sandwiches so outshone the Thin Man's braised beef that I must demur.

Whatever you do, try that fig soda if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I've walked past Thin Man a few times but was never able to go in.  Glad I did.  This is a neat little sandwich spot in the Strip District.  They have a more off beat selection of subs - this is not your Jimmy John's or Subway - but a real sandwich shop.  

One of the choices was a Chicken Liver Mousse.  Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling adventurous, so I didn't order, it but now I have regret.  I bet that sandwich is great.  I'll be back to try it.

I went with The Smash. This is a goat milk marinated chicken breast - which they cook WHEN YOU ORDER IT - on a tasty baguette.  Oddly what I liked the best about this sandwich was the pickled onions that are topped on.  Fantastic taste and a real treat.  

I love that I could see the sandwich chef putting the marinated chicken on the grill while I waited.  What a fab fresh sandwich."}
{"text":"The mix of flavors in The Thin Man sandwich is just incredible. Their homemade sodas are great and refreshing, too."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little sandwich shop! The customer service is great and the food is pretty innovative. Cool vibe. If I lived nearby, I'd go back and try other items but I can tell you that you can't go wrong with the Parmesan Braised Chicken sandwich. Yum!"}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop in the strip district.  Makes good sandwiches that are alittle different then the usual tuna sub or ham and cheese.  I had the pork tenderloin with orange and radicchio...it was very good though you have to like fruit and protein together.  The lime and honey selzer was also good.  This is a small place though there is a small room upstairs as well.  All the ingredients were fresh .  No alcohol served."}
{"text":"I SO wanted to go here after word of mouth and fellow yelper reviews had me super excited. So we went after our Wigle Whiskey tour and WOW! Am I glad I did!!  I knew that the owners were classically trained and had worked at one of my favorite top end restaurants, Isabela's on Grandview, but didn't know that level of sophistication could be applied to the common sandwich. But oh, my friends, these are NOT common sandwiches! I was blown away! Temptation stares you in the face as you look at the chalkboard menu complete with scratch outs as items sell out.

I was fortunate to have had the wisdom/luck to order the Korean BBQ Beef brisket which has haunted me ever since. Can a sandwich really be that good?? I'm ruined forever! Tender BBQ Korean brisket, pickled bean sprouts (you read that right) and snow peas and a fresh baguette - it put a smile on my face for days. And left a craving for more I can't quite satisfy.

My wife got the Sweet and Sour pork with roasted apricots, honey and thyme which was good but not as good as mine. My daughter got the grilled paneer with green mango and coriander chutney on a pita. I had some of that (naturally!) and can say it was AWESOME!! Next time I'm gonna get the Il Bastardo cause I love fresh mortadella - that is, if I can exercise some restraint and not get that brisket...."}
{"text":"Nice location. Creative ideas, but the food just doesn't taste good. 

I had a seasonal sandwich with burata and squash, and although the sandwich was perfectly executed, it was lack luster and not very satisfying.

We also had the roast beef sandwich and it was very dry. The onions were over-powering and was missing that extra something to make it a stand out.

We had the quinoa and farro as a side, and it tasted sour and the cauliflower was way over cooked. This dish was just straight up nasty.

Finally, we had the whole grain mac and cheese and it was pretty decent, definitely the most flavorful dish of the day, but still quite bland.

We had the house made seltzer and that was tasty and refreshing.

All in all this place is mediocre at best. Way overpriced...and the cashier at the place was pretty dry...like the food."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, but I thought my sandwich was just A-OK.  I had The Smash, with goat milk marinated chicken, avocado, pickled green onion, and alfalfa.  It was good.  The pickled green onion is what made the entire sandwich, which was served on a toasted wheat roll.

I will absolutely be back bc they had a grilled sweet potato and beet sandwich that I'd almost ordered and now I have to try.  It's not cheap, but its good, and I can't wait to be wowed next time."}
{"text":"Really good.   From the cream if chard soup to the crispy risotto cake sides.  Our sandwiches were also delicious.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Yelp, and the good reviews had me curious to try it. I decided to stop by for lunch. I ordered a sandwich and drink, and the man behind the counter began making my sandwich. The other lady began making my spritzer, a honey lemon that was quite tasty, and the third lady was standing behind the counter (next to the guy cooking)  playing on her cell phone. 

When my sandwich was done, the woman on her cell phone put the phone in her pocket, and without washing her hands or putting gloves on, she stuck her hand into the condiments and began putting the greens on my sandwich. She folded the sandwich, wrapped it up, and handed it to the other lady to give to me. Disgusted by her putting her dirty hands in the food, I said, \"I don't want the sandwich, because the lady was playing around on her cell phone and then put the greens on it and wrapped up the sandwich without washing her hands or putting on a glove. You put a glove on to make my drink.\" They were shocked and thought I was joking. The man quickly apologized and offered to remake the sandwich, but I was done.

I got my money back for the sandwich and left.  My dining experience was not very good, and it needless to say, it was not a very good first impression."}
{"text":"Thin Man Sandwich shop is a little shop serving off-the-beaten-path sandwiches.  They also have some sides you can choose from if you want something other than a sandwich.

The Il Bastardo ($6.99) sandwich was good but simple.  I think I would go for something slightly more complex next time.  I will say the prices are a little high considering the size of the sandwiches, however, for the more obscure options, it seems to be worth it.

The highlight of this store is the friendly help.  The staff is happy to make recommendations and will chat it up with you.  Definitely a step above the rest of the Strip on customer service."}
{"text":"Really surprised this place has so many good reviews.  I just did not have the same experience.  The ingredients all seemed fresh and unique but once I got my sandwich it left to be desired.  The strip has so many great places, I definitely won't be trying this place again.  On the plus, it is right next to the donuts shop and it smells amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Nothing special besides the locally sourced part. I ordered the orange braised pork sandwich. The pork was tender but there was no flavor of any kind to the sandwich. It's like they just used water and orange rinds. The reason for the two stars review was  due to the service; the cashier didn't seem to know the menu and the food. I would not go back if i had the choice."}
{"text":"This place is located in the heart of the Strip district, at the corner of 21st and Smallman. Always a great meal here! The staff is always so friendly and the food is very high-quality. I've been here at different times of day and it's usually not overwhelmingly crowded. Sandwiches are made to order, so don't expect fast-food Subway completion time. The wait won't be that long and it will absolutely be worth it. I love that they use local ingredients when they are able...being located within blocks of butchers, grocers, etc. in the strip is a huge benefit!!

They have a Signature Sandwich menu as well as a Seasonal Menu. Their namesake sandwich, The Thin Man, has Chicken Liver Mousse, Bacon, Endives and Red Wine Vinaigrette on a baguette. The Chicken Liver Mousse is a little too salty for me, but this is my boyfriend and many other friends' absolute favorite sandwich by far. It is a very unique and strong flavor, but if you are feeling adventurous, you should go for it!

My favorite Signature sandwich is The Smash- Goat Milk Marinated Organic Chicken Breast, Avocado, Sprouts, Lemon Pickled Green Onion, Multigrain Baguette. The flavors complement each other so perfectly. It's hard not to order this every time I go!

I've also sampled some of the Seasonal sandwiches, one with collard greens and another one with Cajun-style shrimp. They were both delicious and I look forward to trying other seasonal items!

Be sure to try one of their homemade seltzer drinks too! My favorite is the Sweet Ginger."}
{"text":"If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would eat here all of the time. 

Instead of choosing the top rated \"best sandwich\" spot in Pittsburg, I went with the underdog and was so happy I did.  No waiting in line, local ingredients, great lunch spot vibe.

  I ordered The Smash (grilled chx, sprouts, goat milk) which was served on a freshly made, toasted wheat roll.  It was large enough that I saved the other half for later.  They make fresh in-house seltzers that are delicious.

Sat by the front window on a busy Saturday afternoon, watching the people walk by.  I loved it."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and both times the food was amazing. Thin man has unique and delicious food. Another bonus is the folks that work there are super nice."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't that busy. The interior was comfortable and clean. I ordered the roasted pork belly, couscous & quinoa side dish, and rhubarb-kiwi seltzer drink. I love pork belly and was excited to try the sandwich but was disappointed. I could not taste the cayenne on the pork belly and the grilled scallions were barely there. With the couscous and quinoa side dish, I liked the radish in it to give it a nice bite but could really taste the couscous and not the quinoa. Lastly, the rhubarb-kiwi seltzer drink was an interesting flavor combination. My one critique of the seltzer drink was that it became flat within 30 minutes. Overall, I thought the food was good but I was left wanting more."}
{"text":"I stopped into Thin Man on a Saturday afternoon in the Strip and couldn't wait to try it out.  A quick glance at the menu and I noticed that the prices seemed a little steep, but given the quality ingredients figured that it was worth the cost.  We placed our order and then waited... and waited for our food.  We were the only people there at that time so I am not sure why it took so long, but had the food been worth the wait I would have let that go.  Our party of four ordered three sandwiches and a salad.  While everything was fresh and tasted good- nothing was amazing.  The blue cheese on my sandwich was top notch.  The candied almonds on my mom's salad were delectable.  But at the end of the meal we were each left a little bit wanting- for more food and some money back in our wallets.  I am sure the rent for this space is not cheap, but if Thin Man wants to be around for the long haul they will need to seriously reconsider lowering their prices and/or adding some bulk to their sammiches."}
{"text":"I read an article, I think it was an online version of Pittsburgh magazine, \"50 foods you need to try in Pittsburgh\", something like that...that said I should try the thin Man sandwich here.

So one afternoon I stopped in to try it. This is not a commercialized chain restaurant with gleaming fixtures and professionally decorated interior.  I can't even speculate what this space was before it was The Thin Man Sandwich Shop. 

The space lends itself to take out versus dining in. I don't know that I mean that as a criticism. I actually dined in the shop, and it was fine. It's just a weird space. It's not immediately obvious whether or not you can even sit to eat your sandwich because the seating is upstairs and once you climb the stairs there are maybe only four tables... So there might not be any place to sit even if there are only four people in the restaurant.

So I tried the sandwich, as commanded by the online article. Because I do what I'm told.

From the menu:  Chicken Liver Mousse, Local Bacon, Endive, Red Wine Vinaigrette, Baguette

I was definitely intrigued. I don't think I've ever had a sandwich with that combination of flavors on it.

About the bread: it's the kind of crunchy baguette bread that when you rip it makes a crackling sound... Like actual homemade bread with the crust... so I think people who like that sort of bread will be really psyched that they make that bread there in the shop. I am not as big a fan of it on a sandwich. I felt like it made the sandwich dry.  But I am aware I might be in the minority there. I think if this was a bread review I would say, man that's some good bread. But I find that baguettes cut into my gums when I'm trying to take a bite of a sandwich where they don't when I'm just eating them on their own. 

The chicken liver mousse makes the sandwich what it is. I'm a huge bacon fan, but the bacon was just tough enough that it made it difficult to get consistent bites that had bacon, mousse, and endive and so when I did get all the flavors combined the sandwich was really great, but I often didn't because I would pull big chunks of bacon out with each bite and then my next bite would have no bacon in it and just the taste of the mousse. 

That's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's a really great taste, and very unique on a sandwich. I was frustrated a bit by how inconsistent the sandwich was just from a practical standpoint, but the flavor combination is really great.

This whole review sounds so negative, but it really isn't. I enjoyed the sandwich, there were just little minutia that made it not as great as the article had hyped it. 

So apart from the ticky-tacky sandwich logistic critiques, the flavor of the sandwich was like nothing I had ever had before, and it was totally worth trying. I will definitely return, and I probably will order something else from the menu just to see what unique spin on flavor they come up with for that. Every sandwich on their menu intrigued me, and honestly if the article hadn't commanded me to try it I would have tried a different one.

If I were to maximize my experience, I think I would suggest ordering takeout and finding a nice place to eat it. Maybe with a knife. Or different bread."}
{"text":"It's a wonderful sandwich shop. They have a few sandwiches on the menu year-round, but the majority change with the seasons and availability of produce. I have tried a bunch of their seasonal sandwiches and have yet to find one I didn't really like. It's really very impressive."}
{"text":"Quirky little place in the Strip District specializing in very unique sandwiches. The sandwiches are pretty big with reasonable prices, and their contents are very different from your mainstream ingredients. One of their signatures contains a spread of chicken liver and is worth trying at least once. I wasn't so much a fan of it myself but I'm glad I did. They also have some nice soups and drinks, as well as pops made by the Pop Stop."}
{"text":"Thin Man Sandwich Shop has a peculiar menu, but the food that they dish out is very good. The restaurant itself has a strange layout. If you want to try something that is quite different than the normal sandwich, then stop here while visiting the Strip."}
{"text":"Had the Thin Man Signature Sandwich and a delicious, steaming bowl of Potato-Kale Soup... and the Mexican Coke, of course.

Very interesting choices... not what you typically would think of. Expand your taste buds and try a couple. 

Personable staff/owners. Very straightforward; no factory-prepared items here!!

While eating, I watched three different people read the menu posted in the window by my table. All three came in and ordered lunch. There IS a message here: visit the Thin Man Sandwich Shop if you want a change from the usual.

UPDATE:

I have been thinking about this for a couple of days, and I will now say I did not like the Thin Man Signature Sandwich... Chicken Liver Mousse was like a runny mustard, so you got a couple of pieces of bacon and some greens on a well-toasted baguette... with runny Mousse that squeezed out of the sides of your sandwich. The taste combination did not appeal to me."}
{"text":"Fantastic! 

I've watched shows where the host goes to a restaurant, tries their foods and explains the flavors, textures, and so forth. I never really understood until I came to this restaurant.

So I'm going to keep it simple: this restaurant's food is clean, fresh, made to order. You can taste every single ingredient, layer by layer. 

A must go-back-to."}
{"text":"The single best sandwich place in Pittsburgh hands down. Everything is thought out, the menu rotates often, and the ingredients are all high quality, the bread is really good. I really love the staff at Thin Man too. I eat here more than any other place in the Strip for lunch."}
{"text":"You sort of have to come here with an open mind and a willingness to spend some money (they're a little pricey).

The Smash sandwich is weird but good. Loved the roasted sweet potatoes and beets and the chocolate AND the raisin cookies.

The service was good and the decor was modern. Cool that like Carhops, it's not far from where I work now."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! After I overcame a serious case of menu anxiety, I ordered a sweet & sour beef on baguette (Brussels sprouts, pineapple, soy) and a sparkling water. I was skeptical of the ingredients combination but it worked, big time. The baguette was fresh and crusty just like it should be but rarely is; they cooked the fillings to order on a cast iron skillet; I think the water is carbonated to order. The sandwich was steaming hot and tasted really fresh. Perfect sweet & sour taste and tender beef. I will be back for another round of menu anxiety!

Update- got a Smash this time and it confirmed my earlier review. This place is the jam. The ingredients are top notch, the food cooked right, the flavors balanced. It just works. They respect their food and it shows!"}
{"text":"I'm not giving up.  This is one of those cases where I give it a 3 star based on the experience I had, but I beg you to take my review with a grain of salt! **My husband and I gave up meat for lent.**  Therefore, we were forced to get something we may not otherwise have chosen.  We got the albacore sandwich, the eggplant sandwich and the pumpkin soup.  The pumpkin soup was very very good.  The eggplant sandwich was very flavorful...the olive tapenade the strongest, which was nice, at first.  But towards the end of the sandwich, the olive taste was overwhelming and I had to give up before it was gone.  I liked my sandwich more than my husband's tuna.  His sandwich was a bit too toasty (e.g. a bit black) and not as flavorful.

Ideally, we are meat-eaters and would have gotten the 'bastardo' and meatloaf sandwich.  We'll be back in the post-easter season, I promise. I hope to re-review soon!"}
{"text":"This is just such a unique sandwich shop! In my opinion, exactly what Pittsburgh needs.  A Must try.

Staff: warm, welcoming, and very helpful

Food: I've tried two of the veggie-friendly sandwiches, and both were AWESOME. The hummus sandwich was salty and delicious. The collard greens (seasonal) was warm, and comforting. Friends have tried the duck, thin man, and chicken and really loved them.

Before you go- make sure you have an open mind. I saw a family come in, wrinkle their noses and leave. REALLY? They totally missed out! If you don't know what something is on them menu, just ask! They will probably let you have a taste. And the seltzer drinks are a must!!"}
{"text":"So another joint I tried while in BucTown. Walk in the doors and was greeted warmly by a lady behind the counter. Asked for the specials and was told to lookup on the chalk board. And boooommm, the shrimp & fish grabbed my attention along with the beef & lamb meatballs. I'm always a sucker for beef and lamb mix. So it took about ten minutes to make which was perfectly fine as it seems everything was made fresh to order. Always a plus point. The minor bump was from the lady who was wrapping the sandwiches (same person who made the drink) I asked her to cut the meatballs wich in half and it seemed the request irked her a bit as as I got an angry facial expression....no smile and quick cut and there you go. She did ask if I wanted the fish/shrimp cakes to be cut but I passed fearing the backlash....oh I also added a peach/star anise seltzer which was a cool unique taste for a hot summer day. All in all, would pass by again to see what's on the menu next time I'm in town. The sandwiches were great and a good balance, unique taste. I would advise the staff to beef up the seafood cakes next time...."}
{"text":"I was walking by this spot and wanted to see what kind of sandwiches they sold (it was my first time in Strip District, and i was trying to get idea of what kind of shops were here).  I saw the Thin Man sandwich and saw it had all my favorite sandwich ingredients, but I wasn't hungry at that moment.  My friends and I kept exploring the other shops on this beautiful Sunday.  An hour later, I dragged my friend back in and got a sandwich to go for the car trip back to DC.  Well worth it - took a bit for the sandwich (5 min wait) which I appreciated that they were making it to order (as opposed to a quick sandwich shop).  Scarfed down that sandwich before I left city limits and raved about it to my husband when I got home.  Gladly hit this up again next time I'm in the Strip District."}
{"text":"Thin Man is good. The owners are super cool and display unusually customer friendly demeanor for the NE. 

We had the famous chicken liver mousse \"Thin Man\" and \"The Smash\". 

My other half liked The Smash, but I'm not a fan of sprouts (too many forced sprouts feedings as a child?) so I can't give an impartial review on that. 

On the other hand, the Thin Man had awesome flavors from the chicken liver and the bacon. I mean talk about salty umami goodness. However, and this is a big and unfortunate however, because I love this place, and I love the owners, and Pittsburgh needs more places like this, but however, the bread to meat/filling ratio was way too high. 

It was decent baguette (albeit American style, with dense, fine crumb, decently crispy crust), but it was just too much bread. The poor chicken liver and bacon, despite the salt and fat just couldn't keep up. I just kept wishing for a bite that delivered that satisfying satiation only animal fats can deliver but it never came.

That was disappointing, not only culinarily but also from a \"eat local, support local\" perspective.

I will go back and try their others and even eat another Thin Man. But I cannot lie, it's not 4 stars for me. Despite their awesome menu, mission and customer service."}
{"text":"I had the Thin Man and a Leek and Bacon soup while I was here, and all I can say is WOWZA! Everyone is right about their special sauce. The delicious, quality food matched the delightful, friendly master chef's (and their mom!). The atmosphere, staff, and food of this place will definitely keep me coming back for more affordably fantastic food."}
{"text":"Best sandwich spot in the Pitt.  This place should be crowded all the time."}
{"text":"Okay so let me get this out. I LOVE sandwiches and when I say I love sandwiches I mean If I could choose one food to eat for the rest of my life, they would be it for me. Now that my love of sandwiches is out in the open you have to know that this sandwich shop is tremedously awesome in all the best ways. Feeling adventurous? Take a look at the menu. Find one ingredient that you like. Order that sandwhich. The sandwiches are adventures on a bun with unique ingredients and savory tastes that will wake up your bored tastes buds. Feeling more traditional? They now offer more traditional sandwiches on a side menu. But the rotating menu is where it is at. Sides are yummy and selzters refreshing. Their sandwich The Bastardo is a yummy fried egg sandwhich that is the ultimate comfort food. So you want a sandwich? You've come to the best place."}
{"text":"I went to Thin Man a few weeks ago and I really liked my sandwich but looking back, I'm not sure why. I had the ham sandwich with dill havarti and horseradish mayonnaise. It was pretty good but just not memorable. I feel like this may have just been an issue with expectation vs. reality. I also played it safe with my choice. I will definitely go back but next time I will choose something a little bit more exciting. Perhaps their signature chicken liver mousse would have done the trick instead."}
{"text":"I live many miles away in Chicago so I only get to enjoy their namesake sandwich on my infrequent visits to the burgh to see family.  This is the best sandwich in town.  As a Pittsburgh kid I grew up loving some liverwurst on white bread with mayo. (and still do).  Thin Man elevates those basics with a sandwich that incorporates new and old Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a great sandwich?  People I don't want to know that's who.  Thin Man Sandwich Shop makes a great sandwich.  I had the Braised Beef Cheeks and it was fantastic.  The beef was flavorful and every once in a while I got hit with just enough of the horseradish mayo to remind me it was still there.  My wife loves Chicken Liver Mousse so naturally she got their signature sandwich The Thin Man.  The mousse was light and fantastic, and the bacon/frissee/vinaigrette rounded out a wonderful lunch.   Bread is often what makes or breaks a sandwich for me and the baguette is perfect, it's soft yet sturdy, the perfect combination.

My biggest complaint was there wasn't enough seating.  There isn't a ton of places to sit, and it was pretty cold outside so sitting by the window was freezing!"}
{"text":"The sandwich I had (the smash) was delicious! It is such a cute little place with a chalkboard menu. The people working there were so nice and helpful. I also recommend one of the seltzer drink. I had the sweet ginger one and it was tasty!"}
{"text":"Smoked Salmon was great....little over priced however... the ingredients are all very fresh and flavorful....hummus was also very good...

staff were welcoming and helpful.....defiantly a great lunch spot after doing some shopping in the strip or for a quick lunch from downtown..."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are imaginative and original and executed perfectly. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon when the strip was hopping. They have their signature sandwiches that stay the same year round and then they have seasonal offerings that change thoughout the year. I ordered the Indonesian beef and shrimp, Chris had the braised pork shank and mom had the smash. The Indonesian beef and shrimp had tons of flavor without being too spicy. The beef was perfectly cooked, moist and easy to chew through, not tough or chewy in the least. This sandwich was loaded with beef and shrimp. Add to that the crunchy cucumbers and toasted baguette and you have a textural and flavorful paradise. It was awesome.
Chris deemed his braised pork shank \"the moistest pork I've ever eaten\" which is high praise from someone who doesn't normally say much about his food. It had delicious picketed peaches and green onion mayo. Be forewarned though, this was the smallest sandwich as we had. Don't get me wrong, it was loaded with meat but the nature of the kaiser roll just made it smaller than the other two sandwiches.
Moms smash was also delicious, the flavors were more understated than ours. The chicken was again perfectly cooked, a nice sear or the outside moist and juicy on the inside. It was loaded with sprouts and avocado and felt much \"healthier\" than our choices thanks to the multigrain baguette. 
Service was very friendly and patient while we perused the menu. They even have some outdoor tables that they are happy to ask those \"doughnut people\" to vacate when they are loitering lol. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you are expecting meaty hoagies, head over to Peppi's. These sandwiches are a bit more exotic. The Thin Man is a chicken liver mousse sandwich, which is not nearly as icky as it sounds. It's quite good actually."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sandwiches! the sides are amazing too!! Very fresh ... Great combination of flavors"}
{"text":"Yes, the sandwiches here are a bit more pricey. However, you're paying for quality. You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients, and the baguette bread is always good, with just the right amount of crunch to it. I love trying their different sandwich options, as they switch up their menu based on what's in season. Overall, 5* for service, 5* food, 4* for value."}
{"text":"Had lunch for three here in early November -- my husband and I had a seasonal sweet potato and brussels sprouts sandwich and The Smash ($8.99, with goat milk marinated chicken breast, avocado, sprouts, lemon pickled onion, on a multigrain baguette), and my friend had a seasonal mushroom sandwich. The house-made seltzer and syrup ($2.79) were super tasty--I give that combo an A+. All of our sandwiches were tasty, but to be honest, the ratio of bread to stuff inside was a little too high on all three of them. So they are good for bread lovers. 

None of us were particularly full at the end of the meal, but we were okay with it because we were trying to keep it light before we all had early dinners. But if I were trying to fill up, I definitely would have needed to try one of their tasty-sounding soups, salads, and sides. 

Bathrooms were clean and smelled lovely, and the staff was personable and kind. It took a little bit of a wait before the sandwiches were ready, so don't expect to be in and out.

Overall, 3 and a half stars, but I'll round up and go to 4. If I were in Pittsburgh again, I would give it another whirl."}
{"text":"Well done Thin Man Sandwich shop. I had the asparagus and Brie sandwich it was very well put together tastes amazing. Honestly, I have walked past this just assuming it's a typical sand which shop however I was VERY surprised by the menu. I will come back! Oh yeah - the Local Honey Lemon Seltzer, amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place. The sandwiches are freshly made and they taste very good. I had the Il Bastardo and it was very good."}
{"text":"Good fresh ma and pa shop in the strip a must for those who like good quality affordable food"}
{"text":"Yum X 100000.  I realize I've been handing out a lot of 5 star reviews lately, but its only because I've been treated to some incredible food!  I am a lucky girl.  

Anyways... this place is awesome.  I love that they only have a small selection of sandwiches that are menu staples.  A vast majority of the menu changes with the seasons.  Love that they use in season, local ingredients.  

I've had the pleasure of tasting their signature Thin Man sandwich.  Chicken liver mousse and bacon? HECK YES.  The flavors in this are mind-blowing.  A little while ago I opted for the Mortadella (also a permanent menu item).  This was definitely a great sandwich, but after my experience with the Thin Man, its hard for anything to measure up.  

However, during my most recent visit... I found a seasonal sandwich that overtook the Thin Man as my favorite by a small margin.  The Swiss Chard.  Topped with a hard boiled duck egg and citrus-cumin butter on lightly toasted white Italian bread.  Wowzers.  I had to save half for my boyfriend so I could share this wonderful experience with someone else!  He was equally as impressed.  

Side note:  The sandwiches take a little longer to prepare.  The owner was preparing our latest sandwiches.  I couldn't help but watch him - his attention to detail is what makes this place so special.  Thin Man Sandwich is a welcome addition to the Strip and holds its own with some of the best food destinations in the city."}
{"text":"Stopped at Thin Man today for the first time...will NOT be the last. The sandwiches (Thin Man and Smash) were awesome, and the chick pea salad was a nice \"healthy\" side big enough to share. Also had the house made strawberry rhubarb seltzer water, delicious and refreshing on a warm day in the 'burgh. Do yourself a favor and try Thin Man next time you're in the Strip...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Some of my Yelp buddies have said get to The Thin Man Sandwich Shop in the Strip ASAP! They were right!!!

Unless there's a line that gives me some time, I'm not good with chalkboard menus. I feel pressured to make a decision too quickly and I did that here. I would have totally picked what my husband picked with 2 minutes more and then this would have probably been a 5 star review. 

I chose a 3 star sandwich. The sweet & sour pork with roasted apricots, that could have been sweet potatoes or carrots based on what they brought to the sandwich which was nothing but orange color. There was honey and thyme supposedly, but I didn't pick up either flavor. The pulled pork and bread were awesome, but can you tell it left me wanting some punch? 

And then....I bit into hubby's Korean BBQ beef brisket with pickled bean sprouts & snow peas and angels started singing!  Oh my, oh my. So loaded with flavor & spice and just ridiculously interesting, in general. 

My daughter-in-law gave me a bite of the Green Mango Grilled Paneer with coriander chutney and those harpy girls started singing again! I do enjoy all things mango but I knew our girls would go for this so I knew I'd get to taste it and thought I'd be adventurous.

Did I say I hate being pressured to order in a hurry? From now on I'm taking my time with that chalkboard until I'm good and ready!!"}
{"text":"Thin Man should be on everyone's radar. Today I called in a fairly extreme large order in the middle of what was a beautiful Pittsburgh day. They did an amazing job at tackling my 26 sandwich order and with absolute perfection.

But let me talk about the good stuff. Their sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Our entire film crew was pleased with they taste of their sandwiches. I ordered two vegetarian sandwiches and both crew members talked about how excellent their food was. I personally had the pork and it was simply delicious. The combination between the crispy baguette and tender pork was delicious. Reviews from the crew were similar on all the options: smash, beef, blt, pork, cauliflower and tuna.

Not am I only going back, I am recommending this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Super cool spot in the Strip District! I ordered the Thin Man sandwich because it's the most popular on the menu (according to the cashier) and their staple item. Nothing in the sandwich was something I'd normally eat/order so I was a little nervous. It's ingredients are chicken liver mousse, bacon, vinegar, and frisee greens ($7.99). 

Verdict: It was awesome, I'd order it again in a heartbeat. 

I also loved the Seltzer Drink!! I had the Pineapple Mango ($2.79). Can totally see myself stopping in just to grab a refreshing drink during hot afternoons wandering through the Strip District. Indoor seating was somewhat limited, I didn't notice the upstairs seating until I'd taken a seat near the register. I like that the upstairs seating overlooked the kitchen area.

A complete and delicious lunch in the Strip for less than $15 is always a win!"}
{"text":"I have had hit-or-miss experiences here.  Of the sandwiches that are more or less permanently on their menu, the chicken liver mousse one is delicious.  The chicken avocado one is pretty good, but I didn't think the flavor of the pickled vegetables meshed well with the other flavors.

I had a Japanese Beef and Pork sandwich recently, which was inventive, but didn't totally work for me.  The rice cakes added a texture to the sandwich that was a little off-putting and made the sandwich difficult to eat.  My boyfriend tried their chicken vindaloo wrap, which he found to be extremely bland. He also found it difficult to eat, as the wrap job (for takeout) seemed a bit hastily done.

Although I have occasionally enjoyed very tasty food here, I feel like I would almost always rather go down the street and get a sandwich from Gaucho--for the same price, you get a bigger portion and more consistently delicious food."}
{"text":"Thin Man is an appropriate name in this case. Having seen photos here on yelp, I was expecting more food. I ordered a coppa something, which was a capicola sandwich consisting of 2 pieces of toasted Italian bread, olive cream cheese, spinach, and the capicola. Olive cream cheese was probably not needed as the meat is pretty salty on its own. I love Italian meats so wished there was a bit more - it seemed like the spinach bulked up the size of the sandwich but we all know that spinach is really light. I was hungry again an hour later. I think my experience would have been different if I ordered something else, but I'm in no rush to come back to see."}
{"text":"A cool little sandwich shop that is anything like you'll see in Pittsburgh.  Thin Man should be packed every day for lunch.  I am still blown away that during my 30 min stay I only saw 5 other people in there eating their delicious sammiches.  I got the Il Bastardo - mortadello, cheese, a runny egg (more on this later), on olive foccacia.  I ordered and my sandwich was made to order in about 5 mins.  The people were friendly and were having fun which is always a good sign.  I got my nice sized hefty sandwich and immediately dug in.  On my second bite my egg exploded outwards onto my sunglasses hanging on my shirt and unfortunately my shirt....GAH!  Still delicious, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Perfect spot if you're in the Strip District and are looking for something a little nicer and more unique than Primanti's and the like.

Unique soup, sandwich and salad offerings.

Pretty standard counter service deli. Adequate and prompt service.

The duck and pork pate was exceptional and served on an excellent baguette. The homemade seltzer waters were a pleasant surprise as well.

Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Mortadella. It sounds like the name of a goth band or the hostess of a weekly late-night creature feature. Bourdain is fixated on this Italian sausage. I hadn't had it in any form until days ago, pining for it as he had, watching his television program, salivating as he munched on what looked to be the most unctuous luncheon meat since Isaly's Chipped Ham.

A spur-of-the-moment decision caused me to surprise Kay at her new job before an Altar Bar concert (Otep!) and treat her to dinner at this narrow corridor of a dimension in which one's culinary mind will... bend and possibly unravel. Knowing that this newly-opened gourmet sandwich shop was blocks from where she now works, we hiked up sidewalk-less Smallman, scarcely avoiding collisions with oncoming vehicles, marching in search of innovation and satisfaction. 

When we walked into this quite literally thin building with a mascot reminiscent of The Church of the Subgenius and studied the chalkboard menu. 

\"Brussel sprouts with pork belly?\" I asked myself. 

\"Broccoli. mushrooms, and mustard?\" I thought I was succumbing to madness. 

Just as my psyche began to splinter, I saw...Il Bastardo. It ridiculed me, mocked me, threatened me...it made a pass at Kay. It didn't take long for me to don my psychic armor and recall Motorhead...

Mortadella: It was what Il Bastardo was made of along with egg, American Cheese, and Focaccia Bread embedded with green olives. 

True to its name, the sandwich bled a burning yellow upon first chomp. 

The egg was \"runny.\" I hadn't caught that, but all it did was make me angry...

Il Bastardo oozed, the meat permeated with deposits of fat, the chewy, crisp bread failing to deter me from handing this ill-natured sandwich the apex of poundings.

Still feeling surly, I tried Kay's Smash, a Ciabatta-fortified sandwich of goat milk marinated chicken breast, avocado, alfalfa, and lemon-pickled green onion. Healthful and hearty as it was rich and tart, like *ahem* the aformentioned child born out of wedlock, each component was deliberately placed, layered for maximum pleasures of the mouth, each sandwich being an experience in itself, none of them resembling each other in the least. 

Not having had enough, I challenged the Braised Local Beef Shank, a supraintelligent strain of that which dwells at Arby's. Shaved celery, fennel, whole grain mustard, and a kicking horseradish mayonnaise made this sandwich a nose-clearing rough trade customer in a baguette bun, the aromatic proteins juicing heavily, yielding to bite after bite easily once its hide was penetrated.

Dessert was a pair of oatmeal yellow raisin cookies that were so diminutive and timid, they bolted! Also indulged in was some dark-as-night chocolate bark (?) that was riddled with caramelized pistachios and was so soft to the teeth, it was more of a thinly (ha!) sliced fudge than anything else. 

Kay's mildly appetizing side dish, Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Beets, itself approached dessert with its subtle, natural sugars and pappy texture. 

If I had to deduct a star, it would be for the inflated prices, a disappointing kiwi-lime phosphate that tasted almost purely of seltzer water (I knew I shoulda went for the Mexican Coca-Cola) and somewhat stingy portions. Before ordering that third sandwich, our tab was close to $30!

Nevertheless, this is an eatery worth keeping an eye on.

P.S. Was I reminded of the film or the Dashiell Hammett novel it was based on, you ask? Me, the fan of obscure comics characters? Do yinz know me?

{"text":"What a great addition to the Strip.   If you like a wonderful flavorful tasty sandwich with fresh local ingredients, Thin Man is the place!  Friendly greeting when we entered. Like the chalkboard menu.  The Thin Man sandwich was so good, though probably not for everyone.  Tasty chicken liver mousse with a buttery and saltiness but not overpowering.  The sandwich also had some great bacon, onions and apples.  If you are not into chicken liver there are many other great choices."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich shop in Pittsburgh. Their sandwiches are incomparable. Every sandwich is like a gourmet meal wrapped up in a handheld package.  I've been going there consistently since it opened about three years ago and I've never had a bad sandwich.  The soups and sides are always good too.  And if you're looking for the ultimate hangover cure, you'll find it in the il Bastardo--carby, greasy, salty, fatty, eggy goodness. (It's also great when you're sober.)"}
{"text":"I had the Smash it was good. I really liked the potato pancakes. I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding!  On a quest for a Sunday lunch option that wasn't heavy, used real food, and wasn't overpriced...I found a gold mine!  This corner sandwich shop is housed next to Pamela's where 21st Coffee and Tea was formerly located.  Walking in, I was greeted by a very friendly employee who helped me decide between a wide variety of very different, very intriguing sandwhich options.  If you're looking for a good old ham and cheese or meatball sub this is not the spot for you.  But if fresh ingredients, unique combinations, and bold flavor are what you're in the mood for, search no further.  I went with the Grilled Paneer with Green Mango, Coriander Chutney on Pita.  This is not a fast food, or pre-made shop, so I pulled up a stool and watched as the chefs prepared my sandwich fresh right before my eyes. The portion was substantial, and filling, without that \"carb-load I have to go home and take a nap now\" result.  Tons of fresh mango slices, and the coriander chutney was made from scratch...nothing in a jar or bottle in this sandwich!  For those who may wonder if I am a vegetarian, the answer is no...but having many friends who are, I am always intrigued by those options as well.  Not only was it delicious...but so reasonably priced I was almost shocked to get such a good sandwich for less than $10.  It may be called the Thin Man Sandwich Shop...but there is no skimping on flavor or personality in the food or staff at this strip district spot!"}
{"text":"The thin man sandwich shop is overrated.
While the selections are unique I feel they are overpriced and are lacking in the quantity of good given the price. In other words they skimp on the meat.
I want a hoagie that is full AND flavorful.
They also don't serve any of the classics."}
{"text":"Thin Man Sandwich Shop is not your typical deli. I've had the Il Bastardo and The Thin Man - both signature sandwiches but the latter being the most popular in the joint. The sandwiches are pricey but large (sandwiches are about $10). I found myself ordering a side but the sandwiches alone fill me up way past dinner. The ingredients are fresh with the sandwiches made in front of you and the unique combinations tantalize the taste buds. Something unfamiliar and pushes my boundaries but is delicious. Worth giving a shot if you have an open mind!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Its off the strip and a lot less crazy than the restaurants on the main drag. The sandwiches are all soo fresh! We actually watched a local farmer stop by and drop off a box of produce while we were there. The smash and the meatball sandwiches are great, as well as the potato salad and the melon soda! We will be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. A lot of the sandwiches looked super creative. I ordered the capicola sandwich and while it was good, I am kicking myself for not trying something more adventurous. Sandwiches were reasonably priced and sized. Lots of options for vegetarians. Most of the menu is seasonal. All the more reason to go back. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and try a sandwich based on the good Yelp reviews. We were taking the sandwich to go.  Stopped in just before 3 PM today when they were not busy. In fact we were the only customers downstairs.  First impression is that the menu looks great but a bit pricey.  
Unfortunately the staff seemed much more interested in carrying on their own conversation and in our opinion they were definitely indifferent and borderline rude.  
The gal behind the counter taking our order handed us the wrapped sandwich and a napkin but we had to ask for a bag.  She reluctantly gave us a bag.  
Haven't had the sandwich yet. Regardless of how good it might be I am not planning to go back again.
They are lots of fantastic places in the Strip District & bound to be friendlier than Thin Man."}
{"text":"This is not just a sandwich shop (even though it's in the name!), but almost more like a gourmet sandwich shop. They're not going to slap together two pieces of bread and some meat and call it a day. 

All the sandwiches looked amazing, it was really hard to choose. I love love love lamb, so the Lamb Kofta Pita spoke to me! Good thing, because it was the right choice! With delicious tender meatballs, yogurt-tomato sauce and jalapeno for a little kick, it was so tasty! For $9.50 it's not a cheap lunch, especially if you want sides, but it was well worth it in my book!

It's a small space, but there's still a decent amount of seating at the bar downstairs or upstairs at the tables. The staff is also super friendly, which leaves a great impression for a new biz. It's a welcome addition for something that I think will only add to the Strip!"}
{"text":"Visiting from philly which is known for its good sandwiches but this place was a knock out. Nice friendly service and delicious homemade sandwichEs. I tried the pork and peach sandwich and I would try it many more times going forward. 5 stars for me. Will come back again"}
{"text":"This place surprised me. It's for sure more than a sandwich shop. These guys are elevating the sandwich to fancy restaurant like qualities. I had a Pork tenderloin and Asparagus sub with a Mexican Coke, real sugar and some couscous. Everything was really good and I for sure will be going back when I'm in the strip. I mean when was the last time you had Asparagus and Pork Tenderloin in a sub? 

Do yourself a favor and next time you are in the Strip District skip Primanti and do the Thin Man Sandwich Shop instead. You will be thanking me."}
{"text":"This place is dope. I'm trying to go again and again after my beef cheek sandwich with a green bean slaw. If I met some tourists visiting the Strip, I'd tell them to go here instead of Primantis any day."}
