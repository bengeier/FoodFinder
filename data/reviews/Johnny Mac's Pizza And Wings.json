{"text":"Very good pizza in an area where there are pizza joints everywhere.  I liked the friendly customer service especially.  Will definitely get them again when I am back in the area."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza for fair prices. If you're looking to get a few slices, you can do it here. The pieces are very big so make sure you're hungry!"}
{"text":"At best average pizza...thought it would be better having such good reviews...had delivered service and they forgot silverware but the driver went and got me some....italian dressing tasted like vinegar n oil with no seasoning...doubt if I would ever order again"}
{"text":"Being new to the area we've tried more than several pizza shops. Until ordering from Johnny Mac's, every other attempt at non-chain pizza has been a disappointment. 
Tonight we ordered a pepperoni/mushroom Daddy Mac pizza with breadsticks (marinara sauce) and a 2 liter of Pepsi for a very reasonable price.  Our dinner was fresh and hot upon pick up. And, the staff was friendly and helpful. Location is convenient next to Giant Eagle too. 
I've saved Johnny Mac's in my phone and have found our new favorite pizza shop!
Thanks guys. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Always looking for great wings. The crispiness was right on and it is hard to find full wings. Pizza was good also. Prices were very affordable. Think we found our new favorite wing place."}
{"text":"We ordered from Johnny Macs last night and were very disappointed , first of all when ordering their white pizza with spinach I asked if they used fresh spinach they said yes but it was not and no flavor to their pizza at all. We also order a regular cheese pizza with not much flavor either had a hard time believe it was fresh dough and both were burnt very hard crust. My daughter doesn't like  pizza  so we ordered her the Italian hoagie she was very disappointed as well had a couple bite's and was done . I would not recommend this pizza place ."}
{"text":"good pizza nice crust right proportion of toppings.wings very good cooked perfect"}
{"text":"We have tried almost everything here, and we have never been disappointed! Plus the people there are always friendly and the prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommended it!"}
{"text":"The service here is friendly but the pizza just wasn't good. I was so disappointed especially since this place has such great reviews. It came down to the crust for me, my guess is that they use whole wheat flour because it was brown on the inside and had a different flavor then what I'm used to. I just didn't like it and couldn't get past it."}
{"text":"Johnny  Mac's is a relatively new place in Monroeville.  I'd never heard of it until one of my co-workers suggested we stop in for lunch after doing a morning's hike in Murrysville.  

I tried the Little Mac personal 4-slice pizza and believe me it was every bit as good as those from the places in Squirrel Hill.  Just so you know, the Little Mac starts out at $4.99 for a plain cheese pizza but then they charge you a buck a topping.  I had mine with pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions.

Their hoagies are big with a half being eight inches.  They even have a hamburger hoagie, which looks intriguing.  My only nitpick was I wish they had some soups (I didn't see any on the menu). 

If I come back here again, I'll try the hoagies."}
{"text":"Good food made from scratch. Off the beaten path, but well worth the trip...even if you order take-out and eat it back in your hotel room. Friendly folks, too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I found them while searching yelp for a buffalo wings recomendation and since then i've been back multiple times.  
The pizza and the subs are solid and the wings are also very good.  Aside from the food the owners are just flat out nice people that really care about you enjoying your meal...and that really matters to me. It should matter to you too.
Give them a try.  Start with an italian sub.  Yum."}
{"text":"This place had an amazing pizza made for me and my friends. We ordered two daddy Mac size pizzas, one with pepp, the other with pepp and sausage. Added in a dozen hot wings for good measure. Everything was fantastic! Pizza was perfect, and the wings were a great surprise! They were huge! Definitely fed the three of us and we were hungry!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here after hearing a lot of good reviews on their wings. Ordered a dozen buffalo wings and a mushroom and pepperoni Dady Mac. Pizza was average. Wasn't a lot of cheese or sauce on it and neither had a much flavor. 

Wings were decent, buffalo sauce was pretty good but the wings seemed to be just a little undercooked for my liking they almost seemed soggy"}
{"text":"Great food and service!!!! Owners are happy to see you and they remember your name. Sicilian is the finest in town."}
{"text":"We wanted some good pizza and found it here! Awesome pizza and wings; really friendly people. We would definitely stop here again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Moved to the area a month or so ago and STILL is some of the best pizza in the area. Ate I'm the location for the 1st time and the people there were very friendly. Wings are stellar. I'm a wing guy so I know good wings and just good wings to be had here. You can not go wrong!"}
