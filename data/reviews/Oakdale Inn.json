{"text":"This place was recommended to me from a friend for their food. So we went there for a to go order..., we waited AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES for our food.  This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!  The food was not worth the long wait.  Needless to say I had to sit there and listen to a lot of trashy drunk customers, that made me feel unconfortable... And to top it off, there was a baby in the bar!!! WTF!!!! Needless to say I won't be back"}
{"text":"My favorite meal is the grilled cheese with chips and I'd have to say, it's amazing. The service has never been bad, nor has the food. I think it's one of the very few places I can say that for, as well. The only negative about it is they don't have any good dessert and there is no point getting any there when there is a place with great dessert right next door."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. They have one Very Nasty bartender, rachel. She is rude, filthy dirty, and if she doesnt like you, You May end up sicker than a normal after being served by her! recently, a friend of mine,  was served by her,  and afterwards, ended up feeling deathly, like she had been poisoned! BEWARE."}
{"text":"Thursday Is Taco Nite and is just simply awesome for a local bar/restaurant!! Taco Pizza is the real deal! Burrito, taco, very tasty. Corona is the beer special and it goes great with the food!"}
{"text":"For a local, home town bar, the food is very good. Stop by on wing nite Tuesday's. Great value!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, good ol' Oakdale Inn. I've spent plenty of time there while at PTI and living in Oakdale. All you can eat Spaghetti and Taco Night were always my favorite nights. O and Karaoke night, fun times. I liked it better when there was a pool table and rarely went after the flood when the new bar was put in."}
