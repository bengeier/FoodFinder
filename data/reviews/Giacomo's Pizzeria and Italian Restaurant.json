{"text":"I've tried almost everything on the menu and have been impressed every time. This place is amazing! Best Italian food in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"First time visit.  Had the trio .  Was good lots of cheese !  Came with fresh salad and housemade rolls.  Portion was generous.  There was a lot of people picking up takeout.  Popular place.  Nice service..  The menu had quite of few things to choose from and great pricing too.    This will be our favorite place to go for Italian now !"}
{"text":"Very friendly, and cozy italian eatery. The pizza and dishes here are good, and it is a very homey and comfortable family restaurant. Never had a bad meal here. Excellent value as well."}
{"text":"We came to town for vacation and found this spot using yelp. It was amazing!!! Delicious, reasonably priced and we had enough leftovers for another meal. (And the leftovers were even amazing!) If we are ever in this area again we will be back. Awesome awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay if you want something more than a pizza chain. The pizza can be a greasy and a bit of cheesed. Overall, its not bad quality or price."}
{"text":"We had high expectations based on the stars given on Yelp. We couldn't order slices of Pizza (not on Sundays) Lasagna was not tasty at all. Garlic knots were half cooked. Server forgot our drinks. Not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I was here today and this place is good. When it comes right down to it, it's a dressed up pizza place. The owner is super nice and straight off the boat from Italy. I read reviews about \"in the mood for NY Style\" pizza which didn't see billed anywhere on any signs or the menu. What I read was pizza. I was a little miffed reading it. Isn't NY Style just really a bunch of Italian immigrants who landed in NY and made pizza, so I don't know what these people were talking about anyway because the owner (Sal) grew up in Naples.  I had the pizza and it was good. Not greasy cheap cheese cardboard pizza, but thin crusted pizzas just like the Italians in Boston's North End where I spent my childhood. So maybe I'm bias to real Italians making real pizza. It was loaded with pepperoni and they were flavorful. The sauce was on the sweet side and the pieces slices were good size. They cost a whole 1.95 well worth the money. My family had several of the other dishes and they were good also with a variety of sauce. Most places use the same style sauce in every dish but these were seasoned according the billing of the sauce. I read in another review that they use all frozen stuff which I can believe as do most all smaller everyday restaurants and all chains. This isn't fine dining. I rated it very good as a place and gave it the extra to excellent to counter act the poor from the no taste bud and disgruntle ex-employee reviews!  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49022-d1208434-r257600932-Giacomo_s_Pizzeria-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html#"}
{"text":"Great every time. When you hear Italian being spoken in the kitchen you know it's going to be good. I've been here a bunch and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant everything ordered here is good,  place is kinda small and busy on Fri & Sat the most not open mondays"}
{"text":"Best chicken parm, fried cheese, Caesar salad, and calamari EVER. This place is the real deal"}
{"text":"Got there about 920pm and they close at 10.  They didn't seem put out at all. Service was good but the food was great. Portions are huge and taste very good. I had the chicken parm and it was on the mark! Would 100% recommend this place to anyone wanting Italian food!"}
{"text":"Did the ownership of this place change? This place used to be 5 stars. I don't know what happened. The pizza was horrible and the garlic knots seemed like they were reheated. Really sad...I used to live this place."}
{"text":"As far as Charlotte pizza goes, this is one of the better ones. Big slices, not too greasy, the right amount of sauce, yummy crust, and lots of pepperoni! I'm hardly ever impressed with the local pizza, but this is really good! Very affordable as well, you don't get charged an arm and a leg.   Service is always friendly and helpful.   I've tried the knots and wings as well. The knots are good but greasy sometimes. The wings are okay, cooked well, but the hot isn't that hot and I like my wings HOT. I'm really picky about wings so I'm not complaining really.   Decent place! I'll definitely come for a slice of pie anytime."}
{"text":"I'm just visiting in Charlotte and this place was awesome. The chicken alfredo pizza is fantastic. I usually eat ranch with pizza but I'm glad I didn't, it would have taken away from the flavor. Small place but no wait. Relatively fast and friendly service. Prices aren't outrageous either."}
{"text":"Healthy portions. Overall taste... decent.  I expected more because this place came highly recommended from a friend."}
{"text":"My granddaughter who lives in Charlotte took me to this restaurant. The bread was delicious and the Chicken Parmesan was great..big portions for lunch. The owner came out of the kitchen and greeted us..very friendly person. I would return because the red sauce was not too tangy and also to order a veal dish.  I give this restaurant 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent pasta dishes, pizza, daily specials.  We eat here once a week.    The staff are exceptionally friendly.  It is not a big restaurant not for large parties (6 or less).  They cater to offices, and events."}
{"text":"I first got pizza here because it's was so convenient to my apartment but luckily it's so yummy and I would go here still if it was further away! I don't even like cheese pizza but I always get it here and it's so good! I've called in pizza and it was ready by the time I walked there. Really love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for a slightly early dinner on Saturday night while in the area for a convention. Hubby and I were in the mood for non-chain food. This place did not disappoint! Hubby got the special, which was manicotti, lasagna, and chicken Parmesan all on one large plate. He ate most of it and then sat there grinning and complaining that he was too full, but it was worth it.  I had the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. The chef was kind enough to put the sauce in a separate bowl for me since tomatoes are a migraine trigger for me. The chicken was nice and thin, well flavored, not dry, and not salty. It was good!  We also had a chocolate cake for dessert. It was okay. The fudge frosting and chocolate moose layers were good, but the cake parts were a bit dry. (We still ate most of it)  Our server was friendly and attentive. Service was fast. One odd note: the check was handwritten. That's fine if it works, but a bit odd, even for a small business in this day and age.  I would go back here when we are in town next and recommend this place to anyone who asks!"}
{"text":"I love supporting locally owned businesses.  I like to come here and avoid the processed foods served at chains. I am always pleased with my food here. Fast service. Large portions for the price.  The menu is large. Beer and wine are also available.   I am a fan of the pepperoni calzones and cesar salads."}
{"text":"I ate there for Lunch on Friday.  Ordered the steak and cheese sub.  The sub was great, the bread was great and next time I will get my food to go.  Only three stars because it took 20-25 minutes to get my food.  Too long of a wait for a lunch break."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and thought I would try it out. Our waiter was either new or not very bright as he didn't describe certain items on the menu and/or didn't know answers to questions about the menu. I ordered the chicken Parmesan which apparently comes with either noodles OR salad, but not both. I guess it's my fault for not reading the fine print, but every restaurant that I have ever ordered Chicken Parmesan from has noodles automatically included. Who would want just the chicken and a salad? The waiter also failed to mention this specifics of this meal. My girlfriend ordered spaghetti and meatballs and received two whole meatballs! When I went to pay I asked the cashier about the chicken Parmesan not coming with noodles. Her reply was \"it's always been like that\". So I guess everyone that eats there has been there before, it's not possible for someone to go there for a first time. The food did fast good, butt everything else I just described ruined the experience and I definitely won't ever go back."}
{"text":"After searching through tons of restaurants online, my husband found Giacomo's and we decided to give it a try. So glad we did because the food was awesome! I ordered stuffed shells and my husband ordered chicken parmigiana. My meal came with a garden salad and I got Italian dressing to go with it. The dressing was delicious and the rolls that came with our meals were right out of the oven, large, soft and very yummy! My stuffed shells were very good and I really liked the sauce because it had a sweetness to it. My husband enjoyed his entree as well. After dinner I noticed they had a chocolate loving spoon cake as a dessert. I had never had spoon cake before but this was AMAZING! If you LOVE chocolate this is a must try!!! The staff was very polite, personable and on the ball as well. Please check out Giacomo's the next time you are craving Italian, you won't be dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I'm am particular about my pizza. But this is pretty close. The people are friendly the service is good. Great food the chicken Parm is one of my favorite I recommend you try it..."}
{"text":"I've had friends telling me to try this place for a while so my friend and I stopped in for lunch after having a bad experience at another Italian restaurant in the area. The lady that seated us was very sweet and our server Chad (I think, can't remember??!!) was super friendly, kind, and attentive. The bread came out super warm and was very delicious and both of our pasta entrees were excellent. For $15 before the tip, you can't beat this. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte!! Try the garlic knots, they are awesome!! The wings are really good also."}
{"text":"Three of us went to this restaurant on Saturday night, January 2.  Keep in mind that this review is based on a very busy Saturday night.  The restaurant was crowded and we were told that there was a 20 minute wait for 3 people to be seated.  We waited for over 30 minutes and were finally seated.  We ordered a medium pizza, a greek salad, and 1 entree.  The greek salad was delicious, made with fresh ingredients.   We shared the salad and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Definitely recommend it!   They provide fresh, warm, home made rolls that were excellent as well.  However, the pizza (which we were looking forward to eating and was our main reason for going) was not so good, not worth the wait.  The pizza dough was not cooked through (soft/mushy on the top part) and the sauce had absolutely no flavor.  We think they rushed the pizza out of the oven since they were so crowded.  Maybe they rushed making the sauce as well and left out or ran out of ingredients for it.  I would give their pizza 2 stars.  The entree that was ordered by 1 person in our party was a penne dish.  They said that it was tasty and that they would order it again.  The waiter was very pleasant, but kept forgetting the items we asked for, e.g., more water, grated cheese, extra napkins, and a refill of soda.   Basically, I think, not sure,  that we may give this place 1 more try for the pizza.   We will not go back on a busy weekend night though.  If it's bad again, I know that we will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and pizza at reasonable price."}
{"text":"I work nearby so we eat at Giacomo's frequently. It is one of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to. From the Chicken Fettuccini alfredo to the HUGE individual slices of pizza, everything I have had from there is amazing! The staff is always so friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The staff is amazing and the food is even better (lol). I've gotten so many to go orders from here, and every time they give me my UNCC discount and are so nice. It's always hot and ready too! I've come here for lunch several times w my boyfriend and we love it. The waiters are awesome and it's the perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"This is a great, go-to place for amazing Italian food at a great price. I've been here many times and the food has always been on point. The menu is huge and has a good variety of authentic Italian food. I usually go for either the baked manicotti with spinach or baked ziti with ricotta. And the desserts a great too; I would definitely recommend the cannolis. The decor is minimal but it works for the restaurant. It gives it a nice, laid back feeling. You'll regularly see the owner or is wife working in the restuarant. It's great to know that the owners are involved and care about their place. I love this restaurant and will be back many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant! The pizza is my favorite, but I haven't had anything I didn't like. Quick, inexpensive and good food. The owners/staff have always been nice and helpful. Not a fancy Italian restaurant, but I would choose Giacomo's over a fancy Italian restaurant any day!"}
{"text":"Updating to 4 stars due to consistency in food freshness and quality, even if it is a little heavy. Sometimes you just need a giant plate of cheese, and when you do, head to Giacomo's.   Their alfredo sauce is made to order, every time. And it's really tasty, especially with a little bit of salt-and-pepper added.  The garlic and cheese bread appetizer as well as most of the hot sandwiches have an overload of garlic, but in the best way possible.  The eggplant parmesan sub, add grilled onions and light on cheese (which is still a ton), is really amazing.  For a healthier option, try the antipasto salad. It's a steal with a lot of food for under seven dollars.  Service is always friendly and good. I love that this place has an authentic small mom-and-pop feel."}
{"text":"The pizza is a bit pricy but it's really good. I'm more of a sauce girl and would enjoy more sauce on it but the cheese on it is amazing it just slides right off! I'll ask for extra sauce next time and see how it goes, overall I recommend if you have a few extra bucks for the good taste."}
{"text":"The food was extremely good and came very quickly. My husband really liked the lasagne and my chicken parmesean was delicious! The thing I liked best is that the food wasn't overpowered by garlic. I like some, but not a huge garlic taste. The house salad that came with my husband's meal was kinda plain. It was basically the lettuce mixture that comes in a bag with a 1/4 of a tomato wedge and 1 slice of cucumber  (this small salad) bit it was still good. The bread is a very good crusty roll.  We had enough food that there was plenty to take home for a snack later. I recommend this resturant"}
{"text":"Giacomo's has exceptional food at great prices.  If you're looking for New York style pizza, this is where to go.  They serve my dad's favorite pizza, but I prefer the pasta.  The tortellini alfredo is amazing, and their spaghetti with meat sauce is my new favorite.  Their garlic knots are to die for and their regular bread is awesome, too.  I love their salad with Italian dressing.    In a city filled up to the gills with mediocre chain restaurants, this is real Italian food made by real Italian people.  **Beware, though, they're closed on Mondays.**"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for the past 4 years. That tells you that I have had every thing on the menu 2-3 times. The staff is fantastic. Owners out of this world. They have no problem coming out from behind the counter or kitchen to see how your food is. I love their bread hot and crispy. I don't really have dessert because of the portions they give, but you cannot eat at an NY Italian restaurant without coming home with a cannoli. :)"}
{"text":"Being Italian it is very hard to find good Italian in North Carolina but this place is definitely delicious!! Had pizza, calzone, and plenty pasta dishes that were equally amazing! Small atmosphere Reminds me of my favorite spot back home! Love the cozy feel and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The best in the area! The pizza is great, but the chicken parm is absolutely amazing. Student discounts are available with a current school ID."}
{"text":"Delicious! The prices were fair, the server was great, the location is acceptable."}
{"text":"Looking for some Italian food after working up an appetite at Ikea we found this place. At almost 9pm on Easter Saturday, the smallish dining room had a good crowd in it. We were greeted and seated immediately, though, and a nice rotation of staff were very attentive.  It seems the stock in trade of this place is solid food in enormous portions. We began with the bruschetta which was very tasty, though served on toasted Italian rolls which made too much bread for my taste. I just ate around it, though. Next came a slice of lasagne that could have easily fed 2 people, and probably 3, and a special spaghetti arrabiata with chick that was good for 2. Honestly I we go back we will split an entree. To finish the tiramisu was recommended. It too was good, though not great. It did not have enough layers of lady fingers for my taste.   All in all a good meal, and a good place to go especially if you are really hungry."}
{"text":"Fantastic lasagna made with simple ingredients.  Pizza is also excellent.  If love chocolate be sure and save room for the Chocolate Lovin Spoon Cake made w three different kinds chocolate!"}
{"text":"Really 2.5 **for the owners/managers were nice. The cashier seemed expressionless. Our first time here so we kept it simple and got veggie pizza and the much reviewed garlic knots. Crust was nice and chewy;however we did not  like the very large cuts of veggies (more like salad size instead of bite-size appropriate) Garlic knots were very greasy and lacked enough garlicky goodness. They were just ok. Maybe the pasta is where it is? Love supporting small family businesses."}
{"text":"This is a true local spot. It's hidden in a shopping center and without a local or Yelp we would never have known about this one. The waiter  was extremely friendly and the food is all prepared fresh there \"other than the pasta noodles\" ni. We tried Lasagna and Chicken Frances. Both were extremely nice portions for the price and very filling- expect to need a to go box.  We didn't get a chance to try the NY pizza but I will when I return.   My pictures didn't turn out well so try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best authentic italian homey restaurant in all of Charlotte. The staff is so friendly and truly make you feel at home. The food is delicious, affordable, and the portions are huge. love love love!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Italian place in Charlotte. Such LARGE portions. DELICIOUS garlic knots. GREAT prices. Also offer a student discount. I always make the drive to university just to get good italian."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to celebrate my Birthday, and got real lucky. I had mentioned wanting to go to an Italian place that reminded me of the delicious food I ate growing up in New York. After passing the restaurant, I took a quick look at Yelp, and figured we would would give it a try.   Since that first visit, we have been back quite a number of times. In fact, each time we have been there, we have been served by the same person. Juan greets us with a smile, and starts us out with our usual drinks.  For appetizers, the garlic knots have been the only thing I have tried. They always come out hot and fresh.  The chicken parmigiana plate is my go to. It is always delicious! The portion size is big, and I get it with a side of spaghetti (salad is offered as an alternative to the pasta).   Staff is always great, lots of smiles."}
{"text":"Best pizza/italian food from a small place I've had since moving here from NY. Will be coming back. Not the best service but it's mostly college kids so you get what you expect. But the quality of the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I ordered take out tonight and was so happy....this food was delicious!  The servings were huge and the quality of the food was great.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it tasted homemade and there was a perfect amount of cheese.  The ziti with pink sauce was oh so creamy.  The garlic knots...wow.  So very tasty.  And the zeppole were light, sweet, and addictive.  I can't wait to go back and dine at the restaurant - if my experience meets my expectations, they will definitely get a 5!"}
{"text":"it's a cute little pizzeria that serves decent food at good prices. I honestly have never gotten so much pasta for the price from any other restaurant which is a really good positive of the place. it gets crowded sometimes in the parking isn't that great but the food is good and they don't deliver. if they delivered it I would give it five stars but they don't."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian place ever! I never order red sauce anywhere because it's never as good as my mamas (who is Italian) but today for some reason I decided to, and it was amazing!! I had the baked manicotti and my husband had ravioli. The garlic knots are to die for and the service was amazing! I can't say enough good things about this place! I wish we lived locally just so I could eat here all the time!! So amazing"}
{"text":"First timer.   The restaurant is a small restaurant filled with workers who had big smiles. We were immediately greeted when we walked in, and the hostess/waitress sat us within a minute.  The menu is very overwhelming because it is 3 LONG pages of food with prices. They had 3 Thursday specials on a chalkboard in front of the hostess area. Since the menu was so overwhelming and the specials seemed like a good price, I ordered the Italian Trio. The Italian Trio consists portions of chicken parmesan, lasagna, and baked manicotti. The special also comes with lovely sized salad and two rolls of ciabatta bread. All of that for $11.95! I also ordered a fried cheese appetizer (4 cheese sticks), which was $6.25.  After about a 5-10 minute wait, the salad and bread came out. The rolls were steaming hot and the salad (Caesar dressing) tasted fresh! Our fried cheese appetizer also arrived. Holy moly...those cheese sticks were delicious. The marinara sauce that came with it tasted amazing. I'm assuming it is homemade.   Finally, the Italian Trio came out. First thought? That is a lot of cheese. That is way too much for me. I'm already full from my salad and bread. The baked manicotti was the best part of the dish. The chicken parm comes in 2nd place and the lasagna came in 3rd (however, I'm not a lasagna person).  Food was amazing. Service was excellent. Sandra was very kind & answered all my questions. She was very sweet. I will definitely come back again if I'm ever in the area.  I was with a friend and our total bill was $32.26 (2x Italian Trio & 1 order fried cheese). Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"My son has been begging me to come to this place and so we've been several times recently and we love the pizza here....it seems to be family owned with a very nice staff so I'm glad we finally decided to try it.  The pastas in my opinion are not as good as the pizza and stromboli, so for now this is my new pizza crush."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza- being from NY, there is a high standard to meet.  Pizza crust was crunchy and held up well to the fold. Sauce had a decent flavor- needed salt or something. Pizza was better than other places we have tried in Charlotte.  Ordered calamari- it was tasty. There's not many foods that are deep fried that do not taste good.  Ordered pesto sauce- the only thing we didn't like, and could not eat. We left the entire bowl there (which we were still charged for).  The pesto sauce is not classic pesto. You know, basil, pine nuts, olive oil. They added cream or alfredo sauce to it. I have never had alfredo based pesto. They need to let customers know that their pesto is different than the standard.  Our server was Brooke. She was nice."}
{"text":"we ordered garlic bread & veg pizza...veg pizza is ok.. bread was dry...cheese and veggies are perfect..garlic bread was burnt on the edges... difficult to eat...overly seasoned... over all its just ok.."}
{"text":"Tried Sicilian style pizza, baked ziti and breaded eggplant. The pizza was very good heated up nice the next day. The baked ziti was good, but sauce seemed plain. The eggplant was good, mushrooms seemed rubbery. The server was good. The hostess was very interested in our opinion of the food. We liked the food except for the mushrooms. I tend to like oregano and basil in my sauce but some people may prefer less herbs in their sauce. Overall, atmosphere very good as are the staff."}
{"text":"The service was the slowest I have ever encountered. The food was little to be desired on top of the unacceptable service. I'm usually pretty laid back and good with any waiter, but this was not the case."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat. We enjoyed everything our party got to eat. The garlic cheese bread was so amazing we ordered another one. We found this restaurant using the Yelp app and very glad we decided to try. Worth coming back to."}
{"text":"GREAT affordable Italian food. I eat here almost once a week. And the portions are usally enough for two meals! Carry out is always ready when I arrive. Very small dine in seating area."}
{"text":"Food was very good and well seasoned. I'm originally from New Jersey so it is hard to find Italian restaurants here that have good food and a great selection."}
{"text":"Great food. Restaurant furnature, utensils, and pizza table racks were a little out dated. Servers weren't really up on their training, but the food made up for all that.   Def good eats."}
{"text":"Gross lunch. Baaaaaad service. C'mon guys! This is a small family owned Italian restaurant, correct? Please hire staff that knows what they're doing not 15year olds that are hung over from last night. The food is not so bad but it could definitively be of better quality. Today we had a chicken and ham special that was more like deli ham and a few cubes of chicken with canned mushrooms and looooots of unnecessary pasta.Yuck! It really pisses me to actually spend money I don't have to food like this. Be more considerate, restaurants!"}
{"text":"It's tough to find yummy Italian food in Charlotte. They have awesome old school pizza ovens and their pizza is addictive. Their service is amazing and I love that their hot pastas come with salads. Their greek salad is one of my favorites- large enough for two meals.  Don't miss their homemade dressing. I've heard there are awesome lunch specials so I would check those out plus their discounts for UNCC students. If you are in the University area you know that top notch dining options can be (ahem) challenging and Giacomo's is consistent and high quality stuff made with good old fashioned love."}
{"text":"I judge many restaurants by the bread they serve.  Giacomo's has thus far exceeded my expectations.  I'm talking about many things here:  the rolls you get as a side with dinner plates, the garlic knots that scream out to me from the menu, and even the crust on their pizzas.  The first impression you get when walking in is how friendly the staff are.  Even with takeout, they make sure everything is \"right\".  I'm a man with 4 kids, so when I order out from this place that means a LOT of food is coming back with me.  These fine folks always scrounge up a nice box to hold all the dishes.    And the dishes, they are plenty good.  I'm not going to claim that they're the best Italian place ever, that would be silly.  What they are is one of the best pizzerias in Charlotte, especially with regards to value and consistently good food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to spend a Sunday afternoon. The staff really seems like they like what they do and that they take pride in their work.  The food is rich and filling without emptying your pockets.  I love to spend time on a lazy Sunday here!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The quality of the food is equal to or greater than Italian restaurants with a much more expensive menu. Italian sausage was perfect, sauce was smooth and fresh. I had stuffed shells (spinach and mushroom stuffed) not on the menu. You will not be disappointed. Server was AJ. Ask for him!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with our dinner today. The caprese came with welted blacken basil.  We have to ask for the bread. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!  Really small, cute Italian place with DELICIOUS food!   My boyfriend and I come here often. I've tried many entrees but my go to is the cheese ravioli in pink cream sauce!  Tip: the lunch prices are about half of the dinner prices and you get the same portions. Just FYI.   Try it! Lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My dad and I always go here and have been going here since it first opened. They have amazing service and I always feel very welcomed when I sit down to eat. Their pizza is very delicious. The pasta is one of my favorite things there. Also, the bread is to DIE FOR. It is all freshly baked and cooked per order. The prices are very reasonable and you get  large portions. I definitely recommend if you want good and authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"I just ate at this place and had a subpar experience. The server told me the chicken cacciatore was not fried but when it was served to me it was definitely fried. When I told him the chicken was not really he said that's what I told them and he took it back and we deliver the food after everyone at my table had already eaten and charged full price for it"}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for my cousin's graduation from UNC and Giacomo's is one of her favorite places to eat so we decided to go there. Food and service were excellent! My Mom and I split a cheesesteak and fries, Gram had a bowl of minestrone and a slice of pizza, my cousin had chicken tortellini alfredo and her boyfriend had a spinach roll. Of course we all tasted and shared, everything was delish! Would definitely go again if I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and garlic knots were to die for from my experience of two years in working in family owned pizzerias. Anyways, we have ordered multiple large pies from here with various toppings and we have not been disappointed with what we have received. Toppings are fresh, and well cooked into the cheese, not still half way raw or cold....actually baked into the ooey gooey cheese and oh so delicious. Very reasonably price for good, as close as it gets authentic NY pizza. Also, definitely order the cannoli!"}
{"text":"Well, having gone to a really great real NY style pizza joint on a recent trip to St. Simons Island, GA, I was craving some good pizza back home in Charlotte. I looked up what was near me on my tripadvisor app on my iPhone, and saw this place, which had gotten decent reviews. I thought, what the heck. Well, we started with the bruschetta and some wings as an appetizer. The bruschetta sure didn't seem like an authentic one, judging by the tomatoes, dried basil leaves, and shredded mozzarella, but tasted decent. Wings were okay, a little on the greasy side, but the taste was fine, and I like that they were baked. But, the pizza, supposedly the hallmark of this particular place? Blah. Sauce barely there, and not sweet tomato taste. Crust was nice. I got pepperoni and mushrooms, and yes, as listed on another review, these were your standard canned mushrooms, nothing about our pizza said, \"Hey, this is an authentic, fresh Italian inspired pizza!\" My wife and I rattled off about a dozen places better than this, heck, my wife even said Papa Johns.  Service was sparse, but friendly. We are still looking for the best in Charlotte to eat some wings and good pizza. Oh, well."}
{"text":"We had a call in order. We were told it would be ready I'm 15 mins. We arrived 20 mins later to be told that they were changing the oil for the wings and it would be 30 mins extra to complete our order. Are you kidding me!?!? If I wanted to wait at your restaurant for good I wouldn't have called it in.  They deliver but only for orders over $100 and I told them I live 3 miles away and they need to deliver it to me for this complete in inconvenience . The \"manager \"said he would resolve this now and get our wings with their fresh oil.  How can this happen?? Oil takes a long time to heat.  We then had to sit for another 12 minutes waiting on our order. To make matters worse, the wings are totally from the old oil and they didnt even give us a discount.  The good may be good here normally, but this service will not be accepted.  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Giacommos has the best NY style pizza in charlotte. Great prices, insanely good pies. Order fresh pie vs individual slice. Crust and sauce are amazing."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise.  We were visiting a UNC Charlotte Open House and afterwards stopped in here for a quick lunch, mostly because we happened to notice it on the drive in.  Very happy we made that choice. The food was much better than the decor foreshadowed. The portions were large enough that my wife's chicken cacciatore was also her dinner when we got home (and almost more than she needed for that as well).  Wait staff was friendly to the point of having a nice conversation with us about the area and the students who come in from UNCC while our food was being prepared."}
{"text":"My first time here was about a week ago, I only tried their pizza and it was delicious. It's almost like I can taste the love that was put into the pizza. I will definitely be ordering from here again and plan to order many more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with the very best garlic knots you will ever find. Also love their cannolis!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food south of Jersey! Authentic, delicious, and generous portions! They have a great selection and prices for every budget! They even offer catering! Check them out for your next date night! They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved from New York and have been looking for a quality Italian joint to give us a taste of home. We ordered a Sicilian pie and the ziti with pink cream sauce (very similar to vodka sauce but just not as \"punchy\") and both were DELICIOUS! We would absolutely order from Giacomo's again. The only thing I was a little sad about was that the ziti dish was supposed to come with a salad which I confirmed with the woman who took my pickup order over the phone but when I got home, it wasn't in the bag. I should've check but no big deal!"}
{"text":"This is the most solid Italian place you're going to get for a value. $8 got me a lunch that I couldn't possibly finish in one sitting and two rolls. It's like they know that you're gonna want to break that up into two meals. My work mates all ordered different dishes with me; varying pastas and some pizza and we're all stuffed and happy on this Friday. Friendly staff. The entire place smelled like fresh garlic and sauce. If you're in the area, you want a great, fresh meal for a great price, go here. This is a little hidden gem in the UNCC area. Will go back. Will be trying most everything on their menu (which is a LOT)."}
{"text":"White pizza, chicken permesan and garlic knots are to die for! The staff and hostess are great! The owners really work hard to serve the best food. I haven't tried anything else but my family has and they love it! Hands-down one of my favorite places to eat at when I go home for a visit :) Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Will go back! We ordered off the dinner menu. I had spinach manicotti, one had baked ziti, and the other had the special shells of the night. All came with salads that were really fresh. We also were given fresh bread, which was heavenly. I can't wait to go back and try their chicken alfredo pizza which is what everyone else seemed to be ordering!! I completely forgot to take pictures of my food because I was shoveling it into my mouth. Oops."}
{"text":"You can tell from my reviews that when I find a place I like, I return. Boring? Maybe, but you can also depend on my reviews over time.  This is a neighborhood place where no one is a stranger! Just 12-15 minutes from the busy and overcrowded Concord Mills area is Giacomo's. Here you will find friendly service, quality food, and a little slice of home. We were so far from home without a sense of where to go, YELP! We called at 7:15 on a Saturday night in June. The young lady who answered was not only polite, she offered to take a reservation for a party of six. When we arrived our table was ready and the service was so nice. A respite from the Concord Mills \"mall experience\"! My sister and niece had driven up from Columbia, SC to meet us on our visit to Charlotte. We had garlic rolls, salads and entrees for six. The bill was only $74!!!! The food was fresh, made to order, and HUGE portions. Might suggest splitting entrees for mid sized appetites. We met the owner, Salvatore, and the hostess from Chicago was delightful. When we come back this will be \"our\" place from now on....."}
{"text":"I ordered Italian sausage with garlic & spinach special. I was very disappointed in the dish. Too much spinach, and hardly any Italian sausage. Pad $13.00 for a bowl of pasta. My son ordered baked ziti. It was penne pasta, and we were told ziti and penne were the same. Really??? This place has really changed for the worse."}
{"text":"I had to update my review (still 5 stars!) because it has been so long- and it is still 5 stars!!!  It's breakfast time but I'm pretty sure I could still eat Giacomos...  Hidden gem, hole in the wall, down home family Italian...call it what you will, but call it delicious!  So many menu options, but the chicken parmigiana is my absolute favorite, followed by lasagna.  Pizza is amazing too!  I should also mention that their pizza put me into labor- you pregnant ladies may want to head there close to your due date, haha!  And the rolls....yummmm.  Still hate their salad dressing though- if they had a homemade oil/vinegar type Italian or balsamic I'd say it's the ultimate...but they don't.  Makes me sad, but i can't count them out for salad- but it would really enhance my meal!  You'd never notice this place in its quaint plaza.  Check it out (but on a different night than me so it's not so busy)"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Friday evening after a very physically demanding day. I was ravenous and had a hankerin' (this is NC after all) for Italian food and knew that my kids would be happy with passable pizza. First off, the place, which is small, was packed and had a thirty minute wait, which in itself is a good sign.  Once we finally were seated, there was a delay of a few minutes before we met our server. Thankfully, she brought some fresh, hot bread which more than made up for the delay. Delicious rolls work wonders on the hungry soul! I had the special which included chicken parm and lasagna, and i found it to be quite nice indeed.  Overall, the food was fine, neither delicious nor bad, and it hit the spot for that moment in time, hence the three star rating."}
{"text":"Stopped with my son who is a student at UNCC...he said they had great pizza.  Have to say he was not entirely correct....they have great pizza, subs, salads....nice spot, tight on seating as it is a popular place so be patient.  Friendly staff and ownership.  Fresh bread subs that they toast, enjoyed a sausage parm sub and my son ordered a pizza.  Both very good and came out pretty quickly considering a whole sub.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Giacomo's is eh to good.  There is a big range I would say.    The buffalo wings are pretty good and they are inexpensive.  The salads are eh? It is eating watery lettuce thrown together with some dressing. The pepperoni rolls are pretty good as long as you have the sauce, but the thing you go to Giacomo's for is the GARLIC KNOTS.  I order the other stuff as filler because the Garlic Knots are pretty darn delicious!   This place is pretty cheap but you really get what you pay for.  It isn't the greatest italian that I've ever had but it's good not great.  Also, what you should do is do that Charlotte Half Off thing if you can.  It's obviously a little work and you have to catch it but hey if you could save a little money AND get cheap food....I mean it's worth it right?!"}
{"text":"Food is never a disappointment. Today it was the customer service. I called ahead and asked about pizza by the slice. I asked if they can do speciality pizzas by the slice. Yes, she said and took my order. I get there and they said actually they can't do it... Funny because you just said you could over the phone and told me the price. Now I have to wait another 15 minutes.   I had to order a whole pizza and do half in half instead of getting 2 slices! Rip off. No discounts or anything to make up for the mistake or miscommunication. Instead I ended up spending double.   Shake my head. You need to work on your customer service if you want to keep customers."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  I was really surprised by the quality and size of their plates. Went here for dinner on a friday night. No wait, though we were seated in a booth by the entry. The snowstorm just passed a few days ago, but the air was still frigid. Hostess tried to seat us more inside, but everyone was crammed there already. props for trying!  Coming from NY, i'm really surprised how not many or any places in Charlotte have vestibules for temperature control. Perhaps it's due to climate change (YES, IT'S REAL) that Charlotte has experienced this type of weather, but wouldn't businesses want to save money on air-conditioning when patrons open the doors constantly? Just a thought and my only criticism of this place - even a temporary plastic vestibule would due the trick!  Now for the main part: FOOOOOOOOOOOD: As appetizers, we had the garlic knots and the fried calamari. WINNERS!  Those garlic knots are huge. We got the small order - 6 pieces. We were only 2 people and could barely finish 2 . Mainly because we got a huge plate of fried calamari. They serve them WITH the tentacles. Yum!   Main course: I had the veil parmesan with the spaghetti. WOW. Two veil cutlets. HUGE ones. I could barely eat 1 and slightly touched the spaghetti. Tasted fresh and the marinara sauce tastes homestyle. Spaghetti was aldente. Not too soft, not too hard.   The BF had the mushroom ravioli. His plate was piping hot, the ravioli were good - they give you lots! The mushrooms were a good touch, not too overwhelming.   Staff was attentive and friendly. Our server had lots of suggestions and was super sweet.  We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Love this place so much!  We always cater from here when we have company or if we have a family birthday meal. For a very reasonable price you get delicious garlic knots,like a huge trey of them, and a huge salad as well as a huge trey of the entree of your choice.  I've never been anything but happy with all of the food and the service is excellent when you dine in. It's our favorite authentic Italian restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"When I accepted a temp assignment at a property in the University area I was intrigued at the opportunity to sample some of the cuisine outside of my comfort zone in Charlotte.  Fast forward to my 3rd day passing this Italian gem.  I finally broke down and called in a to go order for me and my boyfriend to have an easy night in.  I ordered two orders of the Stromboli and a Greek salad. If you've never had a Stromboli it is similar to a calzone but stuffed with mozzarella and Italian meats.  This one had pepperoni and Italian sausage.  I got home and warmed it up in the microwave for thirty seconds and sat down to dig in.  I dipped my bite into the side of marinara sauce it comes with and a second later I was eating the BEST Stromboli I had ever had.  The crust was perfection, the mozzarella was fresh and melted amazingly, the meats were flavorful and the sauce was so tasty it almost made me cry that something this delicious was only $6.50!  Not to mention it was HUGE! I am not proud of this but I inhaled the whole thing that night.  :)  A few days later I called in a lunch order and had the chicken parm sub..... Again, amazing.  Huge portion and delicious.  I must say I have gone back twice more for the Stromboli, as I am a huge fan now and after this assignment ends I will be heading back.!"}
{"text":"Found this place by means of Yelp, while traveling. SO much food! I would have taken some home, but I was traveling; it was too good to leave, though--I ate it all! The veal piccata was very tender & fresh, with a light lemon sauce. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD...Overpriced now that they raised there prices. Poor management and staff. Been going there for 5 years now and that is over. $13 for chicken parm that is mostly sauce and cheese...very little pasta...not worth it. They smother it with cheap and unhealthy cheese. Tomato sauce here is TOO SWEET! Jar sauce is better.  Increased prices on salads which are CHEAP iceburg lettuce only and black olives...1 peice of cucumber and 1 peice of  diced cheap pink tomato. For $5 I would expect mixed greens and real veggies. Nobody wants cheap and unhealthy iceburg lettuce. You are the ONLY place who uses it. It has no flavor..Asked for 1 extra roll and did not get it. Spent $21 for 1 person and couldnt get one extra roll. I highly recommend NOT wasting your money here. Its sad that so many consider this authentic Italian. Charlotte has akways been weak on the italian side. Growing up in a real Italian family I can tell you its not."}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic Italian with massive servings and good service.Take out or dine in are both safe bets."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead with their app and it was ready shortly after I arrived. Well packed, it stayed quite warm for the remainder of my drive.  For main course, we had an order of the fettuccine with scallops and shrimp. A large portion, very creamy alfredo sauce and a few good-sized shrimps in there. Excellent flavor and more than enough for two. The pasta was especially fresh and tasted handmade.  I also decided to get a meatball sub because meatballs. Tasty fresh roll with big meatballs and lots of red sauce. Good stuff, but next time, I would add cheese.  One other thing to add was that the salad on the side was mostly meh but I will say that the cucumber in there was super crisp. Nice!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian small restaurant - nice marinara sauce - ordered bruschetta, manicotti with ricotta and spinach, stuffed shells - all very tasty! Server was pleasant and quick - would recommend to anyone in the area. Italian music added a feeling of being there!"}
{"text":"Affordable Italian.  Go here a lot with a group from work.  The service is VERY GOOD and friendly.... as is the food.  The only limitation is the size of the dining room since it's fairly small so come early for lunch to grab a table without waiting.  I've had a couple of their pasta dishes and today I tried their pizza.  All were good and at reasonable prices.  The other downfall is that this place is closed Mondays.  For some funny reason I always get Italian cravings on Mondays and find out that Giacomo's is closed is always a let down.  I'm to the point that I remember now though."}
{"text":"I would have given four stars except for a bad experience with catering.  They didn't cater, I sent an email and showed up in person.  Not until I sent a notice that lack of response led me to book catering somewhere else did they finally respond.  Too little too late  This place is a fun spot to stop after church.  I really wish they were more organized."}
{"text":"Driven by this place a thousand times and brought the family tonight for the first time. The staff is very friendly and very accomdating.   Food is good (not a fan of the bread), had white pizza, chicken parm and Buffalo wings which were spicy for mild.  All in all a good spot and we will be back."}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed with this place. I was really looking for a good place for pasta and after reading reviews I thought I had found it. I wanted to try something new so thought I would give this place a shot.   The reason I give 2 out of 5 is because service was real fast and our waiter was attentive always checking in on us to see if we were \"good.\" So this rating is based on only the food.  The only thing we enjoyed were our appitizeiers which were the Garlic Knots and cheese fries. Garlic Knots were huge and delicious. There cheese fries were also tasty and good portion size.  So I ordered the Linguini Shrimp scampi which was good in portion size and included a side saldad. BUT it had no flavor whatsoever I found it to be very bland. The discripton said something about garlic and lemon and I did not taste neither. I wanna say it was $13.95  My husband ordered the Seafood Fra Diavolo. He was expecting it to be spicy and it was not spicy at all he said he thought the sauce was watered down and had no flavor whatsoever so I tried some and yup no flavor, it also came with a side saldad $15.95  I ordered the kids spegetti for my daughter's and the sauce itself was tasty and came with the huge meatball. But the meatball seemed to not have been cooked right it was real soft and tasted weird. $5.95 each   I'm not sure if it was an off night or they are just known for their pizza & garlic knots because I didn't see any reviews about the dishes we ordered. I also noticed that everyone was ordering pizza and they seemed to be satisfied. So with that said I would like to go back and try their pizza and give an update because their pizza did look really good."}
{"text":"I was looking for chicken picatta and was headed to a different restaurant that I found on yelp. As I was driving I stumbled upon Giacomo's and decided to stop there instead of the initial restaurant destination. It is located in a small strip mall type of shopping center. Parking was available. There was seating outside that I noticed being occupied by a group who seemed to be really enjoying their food.   I was excited and felt that I had found a new place for Chicken Picatta. Being that I had literally just gotten back from NY and had an opportunity to try NY pizza I was interested in trying their pizza as well.  The staff were friendly and professional in greeting us immediately upon entering the restaurant. The menu provided plenty of options however chicken piccata was not on the menu. The server said he could definitely make chicken picatta since they already offer a veal picatta using chicken instead.  There were so many other items that I wanted to try but decided to stick with the chicken picatta. My daughter ordered the chicken parmigiana and we shared a slice of sausage and cheese pizza.   First the pizza came out smelling and looking delicious. We both agreed that the pizza was delicious and a winner for future dining option. Then came the chicken picatta and parmigiana. The chicken parmigiana was decent no real complaints or compliments to add. The dish we've all been waiting for disappointing to say the least. There was a weird gelatin like lemon gravy. The texture was not to my liking and the taste was overshadowed by the gelatin gravy. I attempted to eat it but was not very pleased. I immediately regretted my decision to stop there for this reason. The visit wasn't a total loss because of the delicious pizza. I would definitely stop in again but it would strictly be for pizza.   I would recommend that they rethink the gelatin gravy like substance for the chicken picatta. If it weren't for the pizza and the great customer service I would have given them 1 ."}
{"text":"Really small place, so I imagine it can get really busy on the weekends. We came in for an early dinner on a Saturday and we were seated right away (but in the last available table).  Service was fast and friendly.   I started with the caprese, because that's what I do. Good size and came with a balsamic dressing (not the traditional oil and balsamic vinegar) but was still good. I wasn't a fan of the mozzarella though. Almost too dry, like it wasn't fresh, but instead came from a package. That wasn't a good sign. But then out came the garlic knots. These, my friends, are not like garlic knots I've ever had - they are huge, like the size of your fist!  I'm glad we only ordered the 6 piece. They were soft and seasoned well.   The kid had the spaghetti and meat sauce off the kids menu. He loved it and said it had the perfect amount of sauce (not swimming in sauce like some places make it). The sauce had plenty of meat as well. We ordered an extra cheese pizza and it was phenomenal!  We're always in search of the perfect NY style pizza, and this was the best one we've had in a long time!  It was dripping in cheese with the perfect amount of flavorful sauce, and yet the crust was not soggy at all!  If this place was in our neighborhood, it would definitely be our go to pizza place!  We'll most certainly return when we're in the Charlotte/Concord area again."}
{"text":"We ordered to go on a Saturday night. The order station was pretty packed. I ordered chicken Parmesan it was decent the portion size was good. My Fiancé had lasagna and said it was great. My daughter had the kids ravioli it was ok. They give you rolls with your meal which were pretty good. Next time I would order something else for myself."}
{"text":"The food itself, 3.5 to a 4. The reason I gave it a 3 is because of the service that was recieved. Not so much from the hostess, but from our waiter. He spoke very low and I could barley understand him. He took our order with no enthusiasm and when we needed his attention, he gave it to us very lackadaisically. When he gave us the check,  he didn't ask if we needed anything else, and he did not thank us for coming. Had the service been better,  I could of easily gave this place a solid 4 because the pizza was very good and the sauce was clearly home made. Regardless of experience,  I will give this place another try."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here on a whim before a movie. We had the knots, both had the chicken parm with pasta, tiramisu and a cannoli. The food was delicious. It's our \"thing\" to try knots at pizza places and these were some of the best ones we've ever had. Our server was great and apparently the owners son but his recommendation on chicken parm was spot on. We've already decided we are ordering their pizza to try Friday night for dinner. Along with an order of the knots of course!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food at reasonable prices. I've eaten here many many times and have never had any complaints."}
{"text":"The best New York style pizza I've had in the University area thus far.  They are a super popular spot. There are always a ton of people here, especially on the weekends. I'm picky yet basic when it comes to my pizzas. I always opt for the pepperoni and sliced Italian sausage. The difference between Giacomo's and other places lies in the execution. The pepperoni and sausage are always sliced perfectly. Never too thick or too thin. The sauce is delicious but never overpowering or in excess. The amount of cheese is just right. The pie is always piping hot and made to order from start to finish which takes an extra minute or two but so worth it. I've never eaten in because their seating is a bit limited but that's never been my plan anyway.   Their slices make great next day leftovers and hold up to freezer storage well. I just put them in the toaster   oven and they are as good as the day they were initially baked.   Great place."}
{"text":"These guys saved me! I was in Charlotte for work looking for a local pizza place at 10pm. Yelp had a place nearby open till 11 with online ordering. I ordered. Went to pick it up and found out they closed at 10 and their hours were wrong. Pretty much devastating when you're tired and starving. At that point it was 10:48. I called here and they were thrilled to take my order even though they closed at 11. So many thanks.   The pizza was solid I just got cheese. The sauce and crust were exactly what they should be. The garlic knots are MASSIVE and excellent. I was also a big fan of their marinara; simple, thin, good flavor!"}
{"text":"Very nice place and probably the best example of a neighborhood mom and pop Italian joint  Friendly staff, low prices, good food and amazing portions"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! The pastas are too. They give you enough to feed two people. Just keep in mind. The place is small!"}
{"text":"I came here for a weekday lunch party with my job.  We were greeted at the door and there was no wait to be seated.  The server was very prompt with getting orders and bringing out food.  The bread that came out to the table first was so good.  It tasted very fresh and was still warm.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was delicious.  The marinara sauce is made in house and you  could definitely tell.  The flavor was amazing.    My co workers got the chicken masala and thought it was good, but noted the sauce was not as thick as they may have liked.    Overall a tasty, quick place to have lunch.  The portion sizes are huge, so you can have dinner also!"}
{"text":"Good affordable and nice atmosphere.   Small neighborhood type restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant states everywhere that it closes at 10pm. I arrived to this restaurant before 9:30pm. We where a party of 4. However I never got to try anything because we where told they where only open for take out. I understand closing the kitchen at 10pm if not state that you close at 9:30. I drove some time to make it to this restaurant with my family. So misleading!"}
{"text":"All five of my stars are based on PIZZA.  A group of us tried the wings once and I wasn't a fan. We also had the fried mozzarella and it was good but served in a few large pieces (which makes it kinda hard for sharing). But forget all that....I'm here to talk about pizza.  The pizza is so good! It is flavorful and a perfect NY pizza. Despite a recent move, we still drive across town once a month to get pizza from Giacomo's because no where else compares for us. The employees are always super friendly and welcoming. We normally do take out so I can't really speak to the dining in experience, but everyone seems very nice. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here for about two years. We love the service and reasonable pricing. I haven't tried much on the menu because I love their Parmesan Chicken with ziti so much. It is our go to place when we want good food and a great relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lasagna is very good. Pizza is decent, but the lasagna...very yummy. Their sauce has a slight sweetness to it so it just goes well with baked pasta dishes."}
{"text":"This was my husband and myself first time eating here and the shrimp and chicken alfredo was really good. Our waitress was really nice and the restaurant was nice and clean. The only thing that I wasn't satisfied with is that our waitress told me that the chicken that will be in my alfredo would be a chicken breast and when I got my dish there was little pieces of thin slices of chicken and it was very little of it. It wasn't worth the extra charge BUT everything was really great. We will eat there again."}
{"text":"I've posted this on their Facebook page and i'll post it here. The Grandma's pie is jesus in pizza form...The grandma's pie is one of a kind and the best pizza in the entire city. I am a huge pizza fan and no where compares. Every time we go, we say we will try something different but always end up with the grandma's pie. too good not too. The staff is great. I wouldn't consider it fast food by any means but It does have a romantic and family friendly feel to it."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pizza pickup and online wait was over an hour, when I arrived to restaurant and asked for my order employee behind register stated that I needed to wait 15 more mins because my order was not ready and she was not pleasant or friendly at all...didn't take my name down or even suggest where to wait. After 20 mins same employee just screamed out \"Sir\", Sir.. here's your order and walked away! NY attitude comes with the NY style greasy pizza and oily garlic knots! Won't be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for over a year and enjoy their pizza, especially by the slice. Unfortunately, I've always accepted the mediocre service for my pizza fix whether dining in or carrying out. But this evening was the worst when the chef wearing glasses was incredibly rude to me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  I recently started working in the area and frequent this establishment for lunch.  I normally get a couple of slices and a coke, but occasionally opt for one of their meals.  The pizza is great.  The crust isn't bland, and it's nice and thin.  I usually ask them to make mine well done, and they do.  The only thing keeping me from giving them that 5th star is the mushrooms.  They used canned shrooms and advertise it as so in the menu.  Let me tell you, fresh mushrooms would just set off some of their dishes.  I don't mind the canned kind, but I personally prefer fresh.  With that being said, the staff has always been wonderful, the service has never been bad, and the prices are AMAZING!  I definitely recommend anyone looking for a great little pizza joint that has a nice, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Seemingly every time I come here I end up ordering pizza, looking over at someone else's plate at another table and saying \"I'm going to try that next time\". The serving size for their spaghetti and lasagna is enormous!  They use fresh greens in their salad; I'm talking about green leaf lettuce (romaine) not the pale green yellowish lettuce from a bag. They offer an appetizer called Garlic Knots with homemade marinara sauce that's pretty good. You're able to order pizza by the slice before 4PM and customize it n e way you like...I like to add fresh garlic to mine. The staff are always friendly and the place is neat and clean. I would recommend eating here if u would like to grab a bite to eat or if you feel like sitting down for a full dinner."}
{"text":"Went tonight for what I was told at a dinner party last night was \"great Italian\" what a disappointment. I ordered the chicken sorrentino and left it there. It was some sort of gelatinous peach toned sauce that smelled like a tin can. I have no idea what that sauce was supposed to be. Tasted like someone poured a can of soup over it. There was supposed to be eggplant on top and it was dark brown and thinner than a piece of paper. You would never guess it was eggplant. The side of penne with their red sauce was a cheaper tasting pasta and the sauce was thinner than tomato soup with absolutely no herbs or seasoning. Again, tasted like someone poured a can of off bran tomato purée over the pasta. I'm Italian and cook mostly Italian Foods. This restaurant wouldn't last a week in New York."}
{"text":"First time here for me.  What a hopping little place. And it is pretty small. But i was alone and they had a table in the corner that could only seat one so i sat right down.   I was right in front so i saw a ton of carry out orders going out.  Tons of pizza so it must be good. I had the lasagne. Really good. Huge portion with salad and fresh bread for just $10 bucks.   I got there at about 5:15 on Saturday evening and it was full. (Other than my table for one). But the service was excellent and nobody seemed to be waiting long to be seated and food came out promptly.   Great spot. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Giacomo's food! I work very close to here so it's a nice place to go during my break. It's a nice sit-down place, but it looks like a lot of people do take-out as well. We got the calamari which was amazing - not too chewy, not too salty, just the right amount of crunch and awesome. We also got an 18\" (large) pepperoni and fresh tomato pizza, which is huge! But we like to save the extras for leftovers! My main complaint is that the toppings are pretty expensive. $2+ for tomatoes?! At least it was a good pizza and it tasted just as good the next day. Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but all of the workers are really nice."}
{"text":"I'm never eating at a chain pizza place ever again. The red sauce for the garlic knots was great, and my pizza is so good! I'm still here and I'm writing this. Wow"}
{"text":"I'm always on a hunt for a good slice of pizza, Giacomo's pizzeria style Italian restaurant is a little taste of quick and easy italian dinning. The menu is quite large offering everything from a full pizza selection to pasta, veal, chicken and classic Italian favorites. The brick oven pizza is quite delish, but I don't think you can order just a slice of pizza.  Last time I grabbed a quick bit to eat I ordered the Alfredo pasta. The sauce was definitely homemade and very filling. I ate to my delight and had plenty to take home!  The decor is a step up from other pizza joints in the university area, so it's worth a stop by for lunch or dinner! The garlic knots are a good start to your meal."}
{"text":"Omg - I've been looking for great Italian in Charlotte for nine years...finally, I've found it!!! Great, fast, dine-in service.  Hot fresh bread, perfectly fried and seasoned calamari, hearty lasagna, and fresh seafood alfredo.  Fair prices, a great variety on the menu, and generous portions.  This place is a gem...I have zero complaints.  I can't wait to go back for my next meal!  I hope they never change a thing."}
{"text":"Giacommo's is the best bang for your buck Italian restaurant in North/South Carolina. My wife and I went there and got: Chicken Parm, Ravioli in a cream sauce, and garlic knots. Our bill was twenty dollars for Italian. You can't beat that.  Their garlic knots are huge and filling. The marinara is house made and chunky. It's a little sweet, but delicious. Their garlic knots have butter and actual chunks of minced garlic.  The chicken parm is legit. It was 7.75 and it was actually better than some chicken parms I've had at the North End in Boston. The North End would easily charge $18 -$24 dollars for the same dish. The chicken is fresh and flat. It has a little crunch and is mosit. What else can you say?  Giacommo's is a total recommend. It's fresh Italian food without the price tag of most places. Also, it's obviously delicious!  P.S. - The pizza is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I called on Sunday (closed on Easter), stopped by on Monday (closed on Mondays), however three times was a charm today!  I was able to customize a dish with a combination of Ziti with chicken and creamy pink sauce which came with a salad.  The bread came out piping hot the way it should be.    The baked Ziti was so incredible I had to ask the waiter to hurry and bring the \"to go\" box to save me from myself!  My waiter was chill but attentive at the same time.  The rest of the staff was awesome tonight making the evening just great at Giacomo's!  Oh and I love the music selections.  My SoundHound app picked up \"Mamma\" [Live from the Detroit Opera House] by IL Volo."}
{"text":"This pizza is AMAZING! I definately will become a regular here. Lol I heard a young lady sitting a tale away say that EVERYTHING is good here. I will be finding that out for myself. The atmosphere is small but clean, warm and inviting and the service is very accommodating and friendly. A good date night idea since the restaurant has a smaller more intimate feel."}
{"text":"There is limited seating here, but I find that all seats filled plus more people waiting to eat is a great sign. A friend and I stopped by spur of the moment on a Saturday evening to enjoy some pizza. Normally I wouldn't have chosen this place, but a fellow NYer I ran into months ago said she only gets pizza from here so I made a mental note.  We ordered a pizza with extra cheese and the shrimp and scallop alfredo pasta. My friend was shocked by the big portion. We knew beforehand we would split it, but it was a nice amount. If you try to split alfredo from chain restaurants between two adults, someone will be left hungry. The alfredo ingredients were fresh, and it was absolutely delicious.   The pizza was very good, pretty close to home except that the crust was a wee bit too hard for my liking. I still ate as much as I could without dwelling on that fact.  The hostess and servers were friendly and efficient. I will most certainly return."}
