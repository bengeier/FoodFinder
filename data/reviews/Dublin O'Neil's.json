{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner multiple times and have enjoyed it. I don't really feel like there is anything very special about the food but it is good quality and reasonably priced. The first time you go, get the mac and cheese as it is possibly the best dish there. The chicken pot pie is a close second and perfect for those days you feel under the weather. The sweet potato chips as an app are very good. I am not a huge fan of the fish and chips but others like it, I just think it is too much breading. The irish breakfast is tasty as is the ruben and the corned beef. The hashers(?) are very tasty. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting good food for a good price. If you get too many people in the place it can get loud but overall the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"We were told it would be twenty minute wait. It was an hour. Food is fine but they need to be more up front on the wait time. It got better, there was food stuck to the menu and one of our party was served tea in a glass with a crack."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally got around to trying Dublin O'Neil's and I'm glad we did!  Our waitress was very good, attentive and friendly.  We got the Irish soda bread as an appetizer and with some salty creamy butter, it was delish!  We also ordered the corned beef and cabbage.  This was not a traditional interpretation of it, as it was served over mashed potatoes.  It was very flavorful and good quality corned beef.  We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch yesterday. I was impressed! We had a very nice waiter.  I got the spinach salad and I ate every single bite. The ingredients were fresh and it wasn't over-dressed. My friend got the Pub burger. It looked amazing. He raved about it.   Not sure if they take reservations. If you go in the evening, it'd be helpful to call ahead. My friends tried to go for dinner recently and they said it was shoulder to shoulder packed.   Looking forward to going again and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"Had weekday lunch there twice. Foods were basically similar though I ordered different dishes: once was the beef with sour cabbage with creamy sauce served with mashed potato, the other time was a sandwich with the same beef and sour cabbage. The flavor was good. Not much meal choices though."}
{"text":"I wish I liked it more, but the only thing to get here is their mac and cheese. The food is just nothing to write home about in my opinion. Also, I was a bit annoyed that they wanted me to pay to sample a beer. Seems like that cost could be wrapped up in the beer price. Who knows though, you might love it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Good food, great cocktails.   Try the Scottish Fog and the Irish Breakfast (served all day!)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place about 7 or 8 times now. I really gave this place a chance, but they have come up short.   First, the food. The burger is really over spiced. After you're about halfway through, it's like eating a giant meatball. I was thrilled to have a place locally that served an Irish breakfast, something that I grew up eating. They failed here too. An Irish breakfast is meant to be fried not grilled as they do here. In Ireland, in many places they even called it a \"fry.\" They try to make all their dishes look really fancy, which doesn't go with their theme of an Irish Pub.  The service was good though I must say. All the bartenders and servers were friendly each time I was there. However, this can not be said of the manager I spoke to there who was very condescending.   And finally we come to the beer. Now they have a great beer selection and bring in a lot of seasonals which is great. However, they do NOT know how to pour a proper pint of Guinness and do not serve it in the proper glass. At first I just ignored them using an improper technique when pouring a pint of Guinness, but the last time I was there, I was served a pint that virtually had no head on it. I sent it back and asked for another one, but what I was given was the same as the first. I talked to the manger about this, and he tried to tell me this is how Guinness always looked there. I informed him that is no where near how a proper pint of Guinness should look and if that is what I got each time I ordered a Guinness, I would have sent it back each time.   I would not be so hard on this place if it weren't for the fact they portray themselves as an \"authentic Irish pub.\" When it comes to their food, beer, and decor, they are no where near a real Irish pub. I will likely go back there, with the hope that they will get their act together, but I highly doubt it will happen."}
{"text":"The mussels are great. The vegetable pot pie is okay--good flavor, but the soup part is kind of thin and runny; I wish it had more vegetables. I always end up getting the soda bread, because the butter that comes with it is so good. The bartenders are friendly. I also just tried their Sunday brunch, which I loved. I had a spinach mushroom omlette that was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Top o'the 'go-to' places to dine!  Pub salad / curry veggie soup and soda bread was best!  Plenty of charm and great service. Entire menu is delightful - as was the staff."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite restaurant! I'm so disappointed to say that inconsistency is the death of thee! We loved the seafood chowder and found the shepherds pie amaaaaaazing! We go back to have it again and it's bland cold and barely edible. We gave it one more chance because we loved it so much and were disappointed again. Chef needs to make sure his recipes are being followed to a \"t\" but we won't be back."}
{"text":"As this was my first trip, I can't give it 5 stars quite yet, but visit #1 was outstanding.  The pros:  The food was fantastic.  We shared an order of the curried sweet potato chips, which were very good.   Our main dishes, the caramelized salmon, and the pub burger were almost perfect!  Their Gouda mac and cheese was the best mac I've had outside of my kitchen.  The beer list was superb, and the ability to choose from three sizes the beers on tap was great, and the prices were good as well!  The cons:  there is little to no noise dampening, and it was very loud for a small place.  Also, do not sit near the front door when it's cold, because there isn't enough windbreak when the front door is opened.  While the food is only Irish-ish, it's delicious and made me leave happy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night. I was excited about eating here (they historically have had surprisingly creative food- gastropub fare). I went craving their amazing Scotch eggs. Turns out, the restaurant is under new management and they totally revamped their menu. It's now much more standard pub food, and most of their interesting items are no longer on the menu. I tried to order fish & chips, but they were out of waffle fries. I ended up ordering their skinny fish & crisps. The chips were decent, but the fish tasted charred. It was supposed to come with lemon butter, but was served with tarter sauce. When I asked for lemon butter, the server brought out a serving of plain, solid butter...definitely not the same thing. It's disappointing to have lost such a great menu (one of the few in town). I do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  The food is authentic and always fresh.  There a multitude of drinks, from a wide variety of beers and wine to cocktails.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered there.  The atmosphere is warm and relaxing.  The server, Ryan, is extremely knowledgeable about the food and is an efficient and great server.  If you have him as a server, he will help you answer any questions about some of the unique dishes.  I honestly cannot say anything but great things about this place.  If you want great Irish food and drinks at a reasonable price, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We have been do Dublin O'Neil's several times now and its becoming one of our favorite places.  We love the irish nachos, bangers and mash and chicken pot pie!  The service is always good and we love to put a penny in the wall each time we are there."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about how authentically Irish the food, decor, or general ambiance is.    What I do know is that ALL of the meat in this restaurant is sourced locally, and is pastured - in the case of the beef, it's 100% grass-fed.  As someone who will ONLY eat local pastured meats, and therefore is limited to vegetarian or pescetarian choices in restaurants, this is an AMAZING gift!  To be in a restaurant that goes out of its way to use these kinds of meats is phenomenal.  To all those who complain about the prices - I guarantee you they are VERY reasonable for this kind of meat!  ...and worth every penny, as far as I'm concerned.    They also use these great paper to-go boxes instead of styrofoam.  I'm thrilled to support any business that goes that much out of its way to support the environment and other local businesses and small agriculture.  As far as the good goes, what we had was awesome.  A couple of Irish coffees (one traditional, one Baileys) to get us warm after coming in from the cold weather, an appetizer of Irish nachos, and entrees were fish-n-chips and shepherd's pie... after the food was so fabulous, we had to try the desserts, even though it meant taking a lot of it home in the aforementioned boxes.  The flourless chocolate cake was good, and the bread pudding was amazing.  We went mid-afternoon, so I can't speak to the crowds, since there weren't any.  The waitress was awesome.  The food was slow, as someone else mentioned, but we were warned ahead of time that it was all made fresh-to-order, so we were already prepared for that.  All-in-all, I highly recommend it, and we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night. Took 10 minutes to get my beer, but the wife got her soda right away. Waiter brought the wrong appetizer.  Advised him of this after about 5 minutes (because he never came back). He realized he gave us another table's appetizer.  He took the appetizer off our table and gave it to the right table (I could not believe he did that).  Then our food came out before our appetizer.  It was very loud and service was not good.  Food was average.  Not a big menu, a little pricy, and small space.  Was the first and last time we go there.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time. I was excitedly anticipating the Shepard's pie, and my wife had the mac and cheese.  After a 30 minute wait, the waitress came out to say that she forgot to put in my food, but had put in my wife's. She proceeded to say that it would be right out... before asking what I had ordered. I asked how long it would take to cook, and she said only 7 minutes. 15 minutes later, she brought out my wife's meal, and said mine would be two more minutes. I mentioned that this was much more than the 7 mentioned prior, and she said she was just the messenger.   So then the chef came out 2 minutes later and said it would be just a little longer, maybe 2 or 3 minutes.   Finally after an hour of waiting, my food was delivered. Sadly, the food was mediocre at best. Coupled with the exceptionally poor service, we definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"So glad I took the short detour away from boring interstate restaurants. Delicious food, friendly staff, knowledgable bartender, prompt service and - did I mention - super delicious food!"}
{"text":"My first and last visit. Beer selection marginal. Shepard's pie was obviously frozen and microwaved. Center was cold and greasy"}
{"text":"The number 1 thing that makes an Irish Pub  Irish is its atmosphere.  Friendly, engaging employees especially the.bartenders are the key to.this .  I.had a late lunch and only 2 others in place,  yet it took 25 minutes for.Pub Burger to.arrive. It looked more like a meatball on a sea if bun than a burger. The burger was.void of any.juice,  certainly not even close to.the medium rare I ordered. A generic complaint is places that have a designer burger mentality dont have standard condiments like.pickles. This place fits that category.  Dublins has a great.selection of Irish whiskey and beers. I been to.many.Irish pubs/bars/restaurants all over the country  and Ireland.  In my opinion Dublin O'Neils is anything but.Irish"}
{"text":"I'll qualify this review by saying that 1) I've only been here once and 2) I got the burger (I'm on a quest to find the best burgers C-U has to offer).   The place is nice looking, if a bit small, and the staff was friendly enough. The beer and cider selection is okay, even if they hit you over the head with Guinness all the time. I was expecting an Irish pub, and the place is more upscale than that. The burgers were okay, if a bit dry, but the cheese and bacon on them was overpowering. It wasn't my favorite food in the world, and I've been in better pubs in other places. That said, I didn't go in to try the entrees, and so your experiences may vary."}
{"text":"Perfect little place to sit and enjoy a drink/meal.  Great environment and service is good too.  The food is quality and they have a very decent amount of drink options."}
{"text":"Irish breakfast all night.  The mac and cheese is killer.  Local produce and great service.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Dublin's has made great strides since my last review. In particular, they now offer drink specials every night of the week, including $9 bottomless mimosas on weekends and half-priced wine on Mondays! I was in on New Year's day (they were one of the only places open downtown) and in addition to the wine special, they also had half-priced pizza. I didn't stay for the pizza, but I drank my fill of wine and left happy. The atmosphere is warm and cozy--a great spot to spend a frigid winter day. I hope to try more menu items and drink specials soon!"}
{"text":"Two stars might be generous for me, but I'm trying to be nice. Despite the fact that there was only one other table seated, service was painfully slow and apparently, if you're a party of two, you can only have a tall table along the wall.   The decor/style is okay for a \"pub,\" but that's where the pub atmosphere ends. It's just another pretentious eatery downtown in a varied genre. No music. Limited drink availability to what they perceive as \"authentic,\" and the first two I tried to order they didn't have the ingredients for. A disappointing start, for sure. The menu is largely English traditional (bangers, Americanized shepherd's pie, etc)  We started with the \"Irish\" nachos because it made me giggle and I like corned beef. Most of the \"meat\" was just wads of fat and they were so greasy that it dripped off the chips as you picked them up. The couple of dry chips we found weren't too bad.  I got the fish and chips which, literally, developed a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket. You have to request salt/pepper/ketchup since the tables the so tiny, I guess. I finished one of three small fillets before I just couldn't do it. My companion enjoyed the flavor of the shank, but it was a little cool in temperature.  The entrees are fairly pricey ($13-$20+) from what I recall, and completely not worth it. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I went to Dublin O'Niel's on a Wednesday night mainly to experience the Irish music sessions (Note: The pub has these performances every Wednesday starting at 9 PM). Listening and watching live performances of various Irish tunes and dances was a very positive experience and added to the Irish traditional atmosphere. If you are interested in world music, I recommend to go here on a Wednesday night.   While listening to the sessions, I decided to go with my waiter's recommendation and eat their fish and chips. The flavors of the entire meal was very balanced. Plus, the fish fillets were very light and crisp. To be honest, this was probably the best fish and chips I have ever ordered.   One downside is the size of the pub. I sat at a table against the wall, and I found myself feeling cramped, especially since the back of my chair was touching another person's back of his/her chair, leaving no room to move the chair back to feel more comfortable. The service could have been better too, since there was multiple occasions where the waiter forgot to bring the appropriate utensils for my meal.   Overall, the pub exudes a good vibe of traditional Irish, and has well-cooked food. Just be wary of the crowdedness."}
{"text":"Ordered the potato pancakes as a carry out. They were no where near how I remembered them. The cakes themselves were very undercooked, not even proportioned, and dry. The red wine sauce was no where to be found, and the smoked salmon was a joke. Dry,flaky and about an 1/8 of the amount that it used to come with. It seems everything on their menu has shrunk in size and quality, yet the prices keep rising. I remember a day when Dublins flourished. Now it's just sad."}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese has so much potential! It's unfortunate my helping had way too much pepper! The fry app is ok. It seems like it's hit and miss here. I might try Dublin again."}
{"text":"I would actually give it a 2 star, but I am *trying* to give it the benefit of the doubt since it just opened. Honestly this place has a a lot of kinks that it needs to work out. Our server seemed to not know the menu and was forgetful-she forgot my boyfriend's appetizer. In terms of the food it was meh. The seafood chowder was awesome, the chicken pot pie was flavorless and my fisherman's stew was missing the fish (not because they ran out, but because they simply forgot). The bread pudding was pretty good, may come back for that. Overall, should have gone to Carmons."}
{"text":"We have not been disappointed by the food yet. Just had the BYO Mac and Che, mussels and chicken pot pie. Scotch eggs and pizzas are really good too. Great food and drink specials every day. Local and import beer on tap, as well as great cocktails."}
{"text":"My husband and I tend to go to the same few places downtown and had never been to Dublin O'Neil's before the weekend. We will definitely be back.  We sat at the bar and had amazing service. The craft beer selection was very good. There were options from Bell's, Revolution, Lagunitas, and Triptych. We both had a Revolution Galaxy Hero. A bit pricey for $8 a beer but good nonetheless.  We started with the Irish Nachos. These were delicious and had corned beef which was a nice twist from options at other places.   I ordered the kale salad and a sausage slider. My husband ordered three sliders. I think the sliders are a hidden gem. They are big and only $3 versus $10-12 for a full sandwich. We easily would've been full without the appetizer we ordered.  The ingredients were fresh and our choices were full of flavor. We look forward to going back and trying some of the brunch options."}
{"text":"I hate to disagree with everyone, but I am NOT impressed with the food at Dublins.  I have eaten there 3 times and have been disappointed each time.  I will not be back.  The Shepard's Pie is not good at all.  I don't like eating lamb and even beyond that it was not impressive.  Maggie Miley's in nearby Normal has a Shepard's Pie to die for.  The Irish Nachos are basically pub chips (saturated in grease) with very limited toppings.  I've had better believe me. My buddy and I didn't even eat half of them.  I bascially took them home and threw them out in the backyard for the crows to pick at.  The Ruben was equally disappointing, greasy, small portion, and just plain not good.  I'm not that picky of an eater trust me, but the food here is just not good.  Great bartenders and good beer selections though.  Come full...."}
{"text":"I really like this place for two reasons:  1. The restaurant & bar remind me of legit-Irish bars that I went to in the nice areas of Dublin.  The bar and decor are perfect for creating an Irish pub setting to get dinner with your kids or have some beer with your friends or to watch a baseball game at the bar.    2.  The food is great.  They have a great brunch menu featuring legit-Irish breakfasts that are the same as the ones I've had in Dublin.  Their sandwiches and burgers are really good and their mac n cheese is heavenly."}
{"text":"Didn't really like this place, the people were very rude and quite mean. The food was not very good. Would never come back."}
{"text":"This is the closest I have seen for Irish cuisine in central Illinois. We did the Deluxe fish sandwich (limited time available pre-Easter) and it was very good. Although I never had it growing up, it didn't compare to Deralds Food Truck.   As for the regular menu items... Mac&Cheese, Burger and Nachos. Those are your best bets. Great location and specials for Irish holidays. It isn't that big of a place, but they usually get you in quickly."}
{"text":"Standard fish n chips. I was happy with my food. The atmosphere was nice. I'd go back."}
{"text":"What happened to the website??? The one time we ate there last year we loved the food. We had a few drinks there for St Pat's & when I looked for the website to scope out what another patron was eating...BOINNNG. No website. I should have just asked."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips on Friday and I really liked it.  I also thought our server was really great."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my husband and son - none of us were disappointed! We had cheese curds, shepherds' pie, chicken pot pie, the pub burger, and the famous Mac 'n Cheese. So delicious! The cheese curds had a light, delicate batter. The chicken pot pie had a flaky, puff pastry and melted cheese topping the filling of chunks of chicken and veggies in a perfectly seasoned sauce. We were fortunate enough to have Craig for our server. His recommendations were spot on. Can't wait to go back, maybe for brunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Now... It's okay.  When we first started coming here, we loved the fact that they had good, reasonably priced food and a good selection of beer that was also reasonably priced. The fish and chips were really great and could easily feed two people. The boxty pancakes were high quality and decently sized. In general, everything was very good.  In the past few months, however, there have been some changes. Serving sizes are smaller. Prices are higher all around. And the quality of the food just isn't up to par with what it once was. It's pretty disappointing.  A year ago, I would have and did recommend this spot to pretty much everyone. Now? It's just another overpriced downtown bar."}
{"text":"Fries were burnt black, can't even understand why they were served. They corrected it and brought us a fresh and better order, but still dark enough to be indicative of old oil. Dublin's seems to be slipping. Hard to justify at their prices."}
{"text":"Finished a wonderful day with Dublin O'Neil's Bread and Butter Pudding. Amazing! I've never had bread pudding this good.   Irish bar, not driving, had to have an Irish coffee. Asked about one and they offered to create one with Jameson... it was brought to the table warm. I asked them to heat... waiter said he would bring me another. This one was much more temperature coffee should be...  Love the look of the bar, brick wall, small tables for hearing conversations, moderate volume on music... but every time door opened a blast of cold air hit you. Next time need a table toward the back."}
{"text":"Seems weird to give 5 stars to a new place in a slightly cardboard building,  BUT the category is 'as good as it gets' and I always rate that according to the city in which I am.... Firstly - to those who criticize it for not being 'irish' enough - get over yourselves. We're not in Dublin unfortunately, which means Champaign doesn't have access to the resources and ingredients that Dublin restaurants do. Ambience: Fun, noisy enough to get away with the occasional swear word. Service: Friendly, unobtrusive, quick. Drinks: Awesome Food: Surprisingly good - more gastro-pub than PUB fare...excellent options for carnivores, pescatarians and veges alike. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Better than I expected judging from decor and crowd. Corned beef made in house and kind of fatty but tasty. warning: it looks like thinly sliced lunch meat so if this will bum you out excessively skip it.  Also, skip the shepherd pie. Nothing but my lamb chunks under a layer of mash."}
{"text":"The beer selection here is really good, and I liked that you had a choice of 3 sizes to allow for tasting a variety of beers. If you love Shepherds Pie, do not get it here unless you want a very nontraditional version. I have had this dish in the UK, New Zealand, NY, and many other Irish pubs around the country, but none were at all like this dish. While the flavor of the the sauce was good, the contents were soupy (you could only eat it with a spoon), the onions were not fully cooked so were crunchy, and the lamb was very strong tasting and in chunks rather than the traditional minced meat. I won't be ordering it again. My dinner companions did seem to enjoy the chicken pot pie and the fish and chips, though."}
{"text":"We have been a big fan of Dublin's but tonight the food was less than acceptable. We ordered the onion rings first and they were under fried and bland and very greasy. Two orders of the seafood chowder were very good. One order of fish and chips was also great and the house salad was also good. However an order of the Ribeye was the worst ribeye ever ordered anywhere! Very thin piece of under quality steak that was grizzly and very hard to eat..asked for the manager and she was not accommodating..only offered another entree and we were not going to wait for another meal as we had been there for over an hour!!! The potato pancakes and the carrots that came with the so called ribeye were both VERY greasy and under cooked.. Very Very disappointed!! There are too many other restaurant options in Champaign!"}
{"text":"We went for Deluxe Fish Sandwich . I feel the bread changed it. You used to get two thin slices of bread, now its one large texas type toast bread and it wasn't fresh. The batter wasn't as thick as original Deluxe and pickles were disappointing!  I hate this as we used to go every Saturday on campus!  Maybe it just needs perfecting more, i hope so!"}
{"text":"I've recently started going to Dublin's in the last 5 months with my friends on the weekends mostly. They've been coming since it pretty much opened. Every Friday there are dinner specials and they are usually pretty damn tasty. Everything I've tried here is good. Come have a beer, some Tullamore Dew, or a long Ireland and eat some delicious food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Before I had complaints about the food being a little bland, but I have noticed a big change this past year. Salt! I almost always get the Irish nachos, and the whiskey sour is to die for. They use egg whites in it, so it's nice a smooth. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Second time here. I like this place! The decor is simple, clean, sophisticated yet pubby feeling. Each time the service was very good. The bartenders are very knowledge on the different beers, of which there are many, and helpful. The menu has a lot of very good looking choices. We had the mussels, smoked gouda mac and cheese, shepherds pie, and braised beef ribs. It was all good, the mac and cheese was awesome, and the shepherds pie was great. The short ribs were tasty and tender, and my only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough for my taste. Overall I would recommend this place for a lot of different types of nights out."}
{"text":"Simple, well-cooked comfort food, and a friendly atmosphere. Excellent beer and liquor selection. There was live music on Valentine's Day. The Irish Nachos and chicken pot-pie were delicious; the shepherd's pie was reminiscent of grandma's."}
{"text":"Poor service and bad food. Never a good combination.  We ordered 2 beers, and the waitress did not know anything about them. Would have been nice to get a warning they were hoppier than that type of beer usually is.  BF ordered the seafood chowder which turned out to be the best item. He also got the seafood stew which was WAY oversalted, like, no one tasted it going out. Stew portion was tiny compared to other stews I've had elsewhere in the country (like 2 mussels, 2 clams, 2 shrimp). Also, the broth was thickened tomato based, which is fine I guess, but I prefer thin tomato based broth.  I had the bangers and mash. The potatoes were supposed to be kale mashed, but I only found one, small piece of kale. They potatoes were cold to lukewarm at best. Clearly sitting in a pot while the sausages were cooked. They were hot, at least, but a little mushy. Gravy was ok.  We told our server our issues and she said, oh. Sorry.  Oh, sorry, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Come here all the time with my boyfriend. I love the irish nachos, beer battered sausages, and the fish and chips the most! Will always stop by when I'm in champaign"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place!  To be honest the food is a five but the service and atmosphere was a 2, at best. It was a slow night so our waitress decided to leave after taking our order, leaving us in the care of the bartender. She gave us one refill and visited with a really obnoxious, intoxicated girl at the bar about tattoos for the rest of our visit. The intoxicated friend smacked the glasses off the head of the man accompanying her, and called other people at the bar swear words (repeatedly). It started out borderline entertaining but she ended up being the most annoying person we've encountered while eating.  After a shot, we thought she was gonna fall down...somehow she didn't....  Again, the food, no complaints! The Gouda Mac n cheese was amazing and the chicken pot pie was perfect. I'd think someone would want to take care of the other issues before the food isn't enough to bring people in!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. Wait staff was pleasant and worked hard. BUT, it was a busy Saturday night and there was no bartender. Servers were dashing behind the bar to make drinks. Bussed their own tables too. AND it took 90 MINUTES to get 3 burgers and a reuben. We were not the only ones waiting.  The waffle fries we were looking forward to were regular fries. Good but not what we ordered.  Burgers had some strong spice on them that we don't remember being in the description. Not good at all and not worth the $15 price tag for a wimpy \"double.\"  To his credit our server comped the drinks and took half off the bill. He was terrific. The rest was a total disaster."}
{"text":"You have to try the chicken pot pies!!!! They do take time to bake so plan on waiting at least 30 minutes, but they are soooo worth the wait! Just get a beer while you are waiting or an appetizer and the time will fly."}
{"text":"There's only one thing that really needs to be said: Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese. Be still my heart. I am so happy they made it an option for an entree. I ordered it with rashers; my sister with bangers. Both were very, very tasty. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. Service wasn't slow. And dessert has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Consistently really delicious food - I've been here three times with different groups, and no dish has disappointed.  The fish n chips is the best I've had in Champaign, with a light crunchy batter and perfectly cooked fish.   Corned beef and cabbage is also really great, served with kale mashed potatoes, red cabbage, and a yummy horseradish sauce.  My only complaint is that the corned beef is thinly sliced like it belongs on a sandwich instead of a pile of potatoes.    Don't skip dessert!  The bread pudding is absolutely ridiculous, and the chocolate cake does not disappoint.  My first choice in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"G/f and veg options available -  more vegetarian than vegan.  Great specials throughout the week, check in often to find your best options for discounted drinks and food. Every day 4-6 half off drafts and sangria. The sangria is amazing! It's delightfully fruity and frothy.  Brunch available and reasonable. $9 bottomless mimosas with the purchase of some sort of entree or brunch item.  Unfussy environment and quick service.  I wish the $3 grilled asparagus appetizer had more asparagus - 7 small stocks are not enough, even for just $3. The waffle fries are tasty, but double check them if you're super gluten-free. I didn't ask whether their seasonings are truly g/f.  As with many restaurants in downtown Champaign I feel like the prices are just a little bit too high. But this place is worth a visit so bring just a little bit of extra cash and give it a shot!"}
{"text":"They can pour a decent pint but the last three times I've been here they' very been out of bangers,and tonight they're out of black and white pudding too. They tell me that one should come on a Thursday if you want the Irish food. How odd.."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight.  I want to start by saying our waitress was excellent! She provided great service and was very attentive. The kitchen on the other hand, was really, really slow.  We ordered beer battered bangers for an appetizer. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the serving was generous.  For our entrees my wife ordered salmon that came with Gouda macaroni and asparagus. I ordered fish and chips. We waited almost an hour for our entrees to be served. When our food arrived it was quite tasty (or maybe I was just starving by then) and the portions were plentiful. The Gouda macaroni and cheese was very good.  Besides the food preparation being really slow it was way too loud! The place isn't that big. When it's packed with people all trying to talk at the same time it's loud. Even with the sound level uncomfortably high, management still feels its necessary to crank the sound system up to a level making it impossible to hold a conversation.  The food is good, but the environment makes it impossible to enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"For some reason my review was filtered, so... Once again!  I'm not picky about service. I'm not the type who needs to be waited on hand and foot. Take my order, bring me a beer and my food, check in once in awhile to see if I need something: which they did just fine.   So what I really care about when going to a restaurant is the food. I so wanted this place to be good, but after 2 visits, I just won't go again. The food is absolutely flavorless! I had the shepherd's  pie the first time. I think it's actually baked in the stone wear bowl that it is served in because it was boiling hot. And I'm not one of those people who complains coffee is too hot if i spill it. I'm just saying that everyone else in my party completely finished eating while I was still waiting for the thing to cool down enough to even touch. I finally decided to just tip the thing over onto a plate to allow it to cool down. And after all that waiting, it was completely without flavor. Absolutely no salt, and what's worse is they don't even keep salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  I thought I'd give it another try because I really wanted this place to be good. Maybe I had a bad night? My friend ordered a soup (some kind of chowder) which was delicious. I ordered the fish and chips. I figured you can't screw up deep fried breaded fish right? Well again, it was absolutely flavorless. Has the chef ever heard of seasoning or, at the very least, salt? This time I asked the waitress to please bring me a salt shaker, which she did. But, I can't say I'll be going back for a while. Maybe I'll give it a 3rd try once they've had some time to figure out how to season their food.   If you love bland food, go here."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant, and ultimately give it two stars based on the conversation I had with the hostess last evening (11/29). I took my mother who is from out of town to this restaurant after being amazed beyond words at the food, and especially the bread pudding (which I hate, and someone forced me to eat, and it turned me into a bread pudding lover! It's made FRESSSHHH and definitely worth the wait!)  However, when we arrived, I just wanted to make sure the food was something she was interested in eating, so before sitting I asked the hostess to see the menu. We looked through, found something we both wanted, and sat. We ordered drinks, looked over the menu again, and the waitress came by to take our order, at which point we found out they were our of corned beef, platters both my mother and I wanted. We were baffled because a.) what Irish place is out of corned beef and still opens??? And b.) they had so many opportunities to tell us that! From the door, to when we sat down, to when we ordered our drinks, the waitress or hostess could have mentioned they were out of one of the main dishes on their menu! Absurd! We were glad we got the drinks for free because we left after that to get food elsewhere.  Last night I took my boyfriend there and just finished telling him the story about how they were once our of corned beef, and as we entered, I too had him look at the menu. Jokingly, I asked if they were out of corned beef to the hostess. She said she would check and went to the kitchen (?? Wouldn't a hostess know what goes on in the kitchen if properly trained?) She came back and said they were not serving it that night. I was confused: are they out? Or are they choosing not to serve it even though it is on their menu (and in many different places on their menu too!) She clarified that they are choosing not to serve it. \"But it's on the menu,\" I said. She was extremely irritated, and explained that it depended on the chef that day if he wanted to cook certain items off the menu or not. ON WHAT PLANET DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IF THERE IS A FIXED MENU?? I understand always wanting to cook with the best ingredients, or with what's in season, etc, but simply not wanting to cook something because you're the chef that night screamed laziness all around. I've been to amazing restaurants all around the States and the world and have never seen this before. The least they could have done was change the menu, or inform the customers once they get in.  If you choose to go to this place, call ahead, and make sure they have corned beef. For now, I would rather take a trip to Lafayette for their Irish pub, which is always, always serving corned beef and has a staff that actually cares about it's customer's and their satisfaction from the door to their seats."}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday brunch with my bf... Got the omelet and the bailey's French toast... It was so delicious! Different from the regular brunch menus around town. I like."}
{"text":"Friendly waiter and bartender. Amazing cheesecake! The music,  the lighting, and the decor all combined to create a very pleasant atmosphere. Comfortable surroundings and delicious food and a perfectly poured imperial stout. My husband and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars.   I tried this place for the first time last weekend due to some friends who wanted to drink here.    There is really two stories when it comes to my experience.  The food-  This is where I would give this place 2 or maybe even 1 star.  I love shepherds pie and it was of course on the menu, so I ordered it.  It was a somewhat decent portion and looked good.  However, the goodness ended there.  When I laid my fork into it I discovered that this was not a shepherds pie.  What I was served was a liquid soup like substance.  I couldn't even eat it with a fork so I had to request a spoon, which was an adventure.  I had to wait 10 minutes before I could get someones attention to bring me a spoon.   The drinks- They have a decent beer selection, but I wouldn't go back for that.  What I would go back is for their mixed drinks.  They have a nice drink selection and do a great job making them.  They take their time and make them right with some semi-advanced techniques.  Although the bartenders sucked as waiters/waitresses (see spoon story above), they were great bartenders.  I would easily give this place 4 or 5 stars when it comes to drinks.  Will I come back?  Maybe, but I will not order food here again.  It is a shame since this is the only Irish Pub in Champaign/Urbana.  No, Murphy's does not count as an Irish Pub or anything.  Using a green shamrock and an Irish name doesn't make a bar an Irish Pub."}
{"text":"We ordered corn beef and cabbag. It tasted horrible. It looked like a stew with cabbage, carrots, potatoes and not many beef pieces. It was a big bowl and we hardly found 6 pieces beef which all were over cooked and charred."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what anything there tastes like except the pub burger ... and I dont think I ever will because its THAT GOOD why would you want to try anything else?   I love the atmosphere ... very old school pub like ... good beer, festive patrons, and the best burger you will ever bite into! !!"}
{"text":"If I have reviewed this place it was over 2 yrs ago the first time I had been there when I was in town for work training. It was wonderful. My family who live in Champaign took me there. Again, it was the best. Recently, We were in Town again and I was so looking forward to dining here again. Then I learned it had changed hands. It was Sunday at lunchtime and they were busy. There appeared to be one guy working the entire place. Although he was attentive he was behind and didn't pay attention to things like we had no table service, no condiments (salt n pepper, that sort thing) our table was serviced after we asked. I was hoping to have Bangers and Mash again but no luck. It wasn't on the menu although they serve Bangers in other menu items. I ordered the chicken pot pie even tho it's price was high at $13. My company ordered a fish sandwich and my sis ordered fish n chips. I was disappointed (actually shocked) when I got my food it was a small round about 5\" diameter baking dish with a puff pastry crust. Inside under the puff pastry was about 2\" of white wine sauce with two chunks of white meat and some peas and potatoes swimming in the sauce. That was it for $13!! No bread no other side. A small dish of sauce with a skimpy portion of chicken and some veggies. I didn't get it. At least throw in some soda bread and butter. My sis invited me to try her fish n chips. The batter crust was soft not crispy as one would expect. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every town has an Irish pub-type bar, but Dublin O'Neil's is above and beyond.  From the drink menu to the food, it's one of my favorite places whenever I head back to C-U and U of I.  The food is a lot more authentic pub fare than most places you'll find (the shepherd's pie actually has beef and lamb stew meat and turnips in it, and is my favorite thing on the menu).  I went there last night with friends for homecoming, and we got a table right away.  We quickly ditched our plans to go barhopping to enjoy more time at Dublin O'Neil's."}
{"text":"Great cozy place for a well prepared meal.  My favorite dishes are the potato pancakes, Irish nachos, fisherman stew, and best of all,  the short ribs. Nice beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Second time visit.  First time was soon after they opened. Good beer selection,  but VERY poor value. Had fish and chips for $15 and the serving size seemed to be half of what we got last time.  Fish and chips were ok quality.  Service was good, but both my wifes burger and my fish and chips left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Eh. It was okay. Probably won't be going back for a long while.   Pros: Chicken pot pie was awesome, server was very nice, our food came super fast, and the beef on the pub burger is great quality.  Cons: Dead silent when we got there (thankfully they dimmed lights and turned on some music 20 mins after we arrived), half my fries were cold, and I don't think the pub burger is worth $12 or $13.  I'd go back for the pot pie if it was a weekend and hopefully more lively. But still feels a little pricey overall, so I know we'll end up choosing other places over this."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Thursday night. There were only three other tables occupied. Two servers and yet service was slow. Took at least thirty minutes to get a Reuben and Irish nachos. The sandwich was good and the fires marginal served with a mystery flavored ketchup. Nachos were cold potato chips with hot globs of what I assume were melted cheese curds on top and minuscule amounts of corned beef ($3 extra) served with a side of sour cream. I asked for the salsa that was mentioned in the menu and was told they told they do not have salsa. The Guinness was good but couldn't have a second Harp because they couldn't change the keg. Overall, not a great time."}
{"text":"The one star is only because our waitress Alyssa was great, but the food was some of the worst Irish food I've ever had in my life. We started off with their potato soup. One cup came to the table looking like soup and the other two looked like congealed porridge, not to mention they where all extremely salty. The cheese curds where about the best thing they had, but the onion rings were soggy and anemic looking. My wife had the pork shank that was so over smoked, she couldn't even taste the flavor of the pork. To this day she can't eat anything smoked because of it. My son had the shapers pie and said it was bland and tasteless, not worth $13. I had the bangers and mash by the recommendation of the waitress and they where in-eatable. The gravy on the massed potatoes was a gloppy gelatinous mass that would stick to the fork like The Blob.  Needless to say I will not be going back there for anything ever again. Money down the drain."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Went here for a group lunch and ordered the Reuben.  At first bite, it was OK, but then I got a big mouthful of fat.  I opened the sandwich and the rest of the meat was so fatty, I simply could not eat it.  I mean big globs of fat and hardly any meat.  I tried cutting out the fat, but it was pretty much all there was to the meat.  Eventually I gave up, piled the meat on my plate, and ate the soggy bread.  My colleagues also commented on the fat and how little meat was actually in my sandwich.  REVOLTING."}
{"text":"We showed up for Sunday brunch at 10 and they're still closed. Their website hasn't been updated and it's been 6 weeks since they reopened. This is the second time we've been turned away at the door. We will never try again. As a business they should at least make their contact information, open hours, and menu available."}
{"text":"The service was really slow. The Irish nachos were great but when I ordered the kale salad I did not expect  just kale with a dollop of Brie. Seriously I laughed when they brought the plate to me. There was nothing to it. A little imagination would have gone a long way especially when the service was so awful."}
{"text":"Aw :c the server (accidentally or on purpose?) told us that a dish was vegan when it was not. We had good reason to believe it was vegan due to some server-identifying context information. When we tried it, however, it tasted... buttery. We weren't sure. I just checked the menu and it says \"flaky puff pastry\" which likely means butter.   My friend ended up having an allergic reaction though which confirmed our suspicions.   Other than that, this place is awesome. How in the world have I never come here before?! I love the interior and the menu is stacked and it's pretty cheap (dessert portions, IMO, are ridiculously tiny but I am also a big eater). I think it's honestly the best bar food and dining menu I have seen in Chambana........... And I eat a lot. Lol.   As for their drinks... well, let's just say that THEY ARE REALLY BAD LMAO. Just come for the food and get your drinks elsewhere. Oh my. I just cannot make my mind jump the mental hurdle of comprehending how terrible the drinks are. Don't waste your money, please. Spend it on some nice cocktails (if you can find them in Chambana).  I really wish that the servers would check with the chef about dietary information before someone is seriously harmed. Nevertheless, our server was really nice."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. You have to try the Mac with just about anything in it!"}
{"text":"Today was the third time I've visited Dublin's.  All three times I've had the seafood chowder, which is beyond amazing.  It is so tremendously rich, though, that it makes you a little sick the rest of the day!  I've had the fish and chips, which were ok.  They desperately needed seasoning--and everyone I've spoken to who has ordered it since is in agreement on that.  The curry sweet potato chips are wonderful!  Today, my sister and I split the grilled cheese which I didn't particularly like at all.  It was more toasted than grilled with butter and it was pretty much burned on both sides.  My sister tried to order a beer listed on the draft list--they were out.  She tried to order a backup--they were out of that too."}
{"text":"A small expensive Irish bar. The place is small and really nothing special from decor to the alcohol servings and from the looks of staff and customers is about as pretentious as one will come across from a Irish bar in Illinois. This bar seems OK enough if you live in area and maybe to come once in a year. At least the bar tender is hot"}
{"text":"The beer is about the best thing here. They tend to be overly creative with the food and it makes it almost too rich or too seasoned to eat. It is a rather crowded place and very difficult to hear when the live music is going."}
{"text":"May I start by saying that Champaign needed a fresh, urban restaurant that offers amazing food? Now that KoFusion's service became terrible, I needed a new place to call my favorite restaurant in Champaign. After looking at Dublin O'Neil's website, I decided to give them a try. They don't take reservations, but my boyfriend and I were quickly seated on a Friday night. Their menu consists of Irish and American fare, hence the name. I love short ribs, only a few places offer them, so I had to go with that. My boyfriend picked the Shepherd's pie. Both dishes were amazing! The short ribs tasted like heaven, but what steals the show are the mashed potatoes. Their mashed potatoes are simple, but some of the best I've had in a restaurant. The dessert was nothing short of perfect. Their bread pudding, covered in sauce and topped with ice cream, is a sweet freak's dream. The wait staff were friendly and inviting, something that is rare in restaurants nowadays. I'm not a beer person, but they also have an impressive list of beer available. There's so many good things I can say about this place. Oh and they feature a new entrée every weekend which is great if you're a \"try something new\" type of person. So there, I've told you the secret of my newfound love of Dublin O'Neils. I'm glad I got it off of my chest."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I stumbled in on a brisk afternoon, hungry & ready for something tasty. It wasn't busy or loud (which it sometime is) on this lazy Sunday afternoon. I started with Carlow O'Hara's Irish Stout (one of the many beers on tap, $2 for 7oz) and Scotch eggs ($5). Both were fantastic. My server recommended the carmelized salmon ($17), which was so delicious paired with Gouda mac N cheese and a wine reduction sauce. Dessert was bread & butter pudding ($7), a crusty-gooey banana bread pudding with cinnamon ice cream & caramel sauce. So good! I biked there so I was thirsty. My glass was empty often & my server may have struggled to keep it filled. Overall: relaxing afternoon, delicious meal, good beer, good service. I recommend going when it's not too busy. As for the tab, it's not campus pricing (read: cheap) but the food is many steps above the cheap thrills of campus nosh. This is a place to treat yourself to a nice meal."}
{"text":"Cute, small Irish pub without the pub comfort but with some gastro-pub aspirations. The best thing about Dublin O'Neil's is the shepherd's pie, made with lamb. It's not just good, it's extraordinary.  Really. Very. Amazing.  Also very good are the seafood chowder (cream-based) and the soda bread. We usually also get their curried sweet potato chips (served with a side of sour cream) as an appetizer and have enjoyed their fish and chips (light batter, beautifully cooked fish).  My boy enjoys their burger.  My husband loves the fresh Guinness on tap. The decor is Irish contemporary. The music is often Irish, too, for which we're grateful, being fans of the genre.  Other reviewers who say the place is small, the noise level can be loud, and the staff can be slow are all on point. It's better to go when the place isn't packed.

{"text":"An Irish pub?  Maybe if it were at the Dublin Hyatt Hotel, but this place was a little too pretentious for Dublin or Champaign.  Lighten it up a little bit, maybe some more casual decor to offset the strikingly attractive architecture.  They did a great job making the interior beautiful, then they foul it up with two big flat-screen TVs.  What is this place?  An Irish pub with the football game on the TV or an upscale country-club cafe? They clearly hired all redheaded young women as waitstaff.   The food was delicious.  But over-priced for the tiny portions. We went for lunch on a Saturday in October, 2011. Fisherman's stew was delightfully flavored, but two miniature shrimp, two mussels, two morsels of fish, and four croutons at $9.95.  My date and I split two entrees for lunch.  Our other choice was Fish & Chips at $9.95. Also well-prepared but about as much fish as one would get with a McDonald's fish sandwich. The topper was an iced tea for $2.50. So I was paying downtown Chicago prices for downtown Champaign, and I left hungry, wishing we had gotten fish at Legends or a burger at Farren's.  With a tip and no alcohol, one iced tea, two lunch entrees, we were out of there, hungry, for $30 on a Saturday at noon."}
{"text":"Dublin's fries and onion rings are fantastic. They're herbed and come with a delicious sauce, and are nice and greasy without sitting in your stomach like a rock. They've got loads of great drinks, especially if you're a whiskey fan. They sometimes have live music in the front, and while they're a little loud for such a small place they were nice to have."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a Monday.  I had the Pub Club (6.95) served with Sweet Potato Chips and a diet pepsi.  I thought the sandwich was huge!  Lots of meat and a tasty red pepper mayo.  Very good.  And the chips were quite tasty, \"light\" and not greasy.  My dad wasn't really hungry so he ordered a Basket of Soda Bread w/ sea salt butter.  After eating the whole basket (almost), slathering each slice with butter, he told the waitress he didn't think this was \"real butter\" she insisted it was.  I don't know...would sea salt change the flavor so dramatically that a man in his sixties who eats and enjoys butter daily wouldn't recognize its flavor?...seems a little suspect but that was the only thing I questioned.  Other than that it was a thoroughly enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"A great local place to eat at.   We had the  Smoked Gouda Mac& Cheese Dublin O'Neils Signature Sald Drunken Bread and Butter Pudding   Loved the entire meal and the beers on tap. The service was great as our waitress gave us background on all the beers and helped us decided which we would like the best. The drunken bread and butter pudding is worth trying, it was served warm and was a great way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the staff, atmosphere, food and drinks! They have live music on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place doesn't have more stars.   Ever since I came back from Ireland I've been looking for a place that comes close to traditional Irish food only to be disappointed. I live in the Chicago suburbs, and I've yet to find somewhere as good as this charming spot.  The atmosphere hits home with dark woods and Irish memorabilia and the servers genuinely care about your experience.  And the Irish coffee! I can't even tell you how amazing and close to true Irish coffee it is. I LITERALLY WANTED TO SQUEAL WITH DELIGHT AND JUMP FROM MY SEAT TO HUG THE BARTENDER THAT MADE IT. Sorry for the caps but really it was an emotional experience.  And the food is out if this world... well at least the breakfast pot pie. If you haven't tried this place and you live nearby stop in and treat yo' self."}
{"text":"I never leave restaurant reviews but this place is something special. I have always been a huge fan of their bread and butter pudding and chicken liver pate. We were a party of two and we ordered all that plus potato pancakes and the meatball sandwich. The pudding was fabulous as always and the pancakes were really delicious, the perfect combo of crispy and creamy. My friend enjoyed her sandwich too. However the pate was a little too sweet for me and I was visibly disappointed as it is one of my favorite things on the menu. So when I let the staff know about it, they were so accommodating. They offered to either knock the charge off the cheque completely while letting me finish the dish or make a fresh one from scratch. I asked for fresh pate and it was perfect!!  Our waitress was really good natured and kept giving me generous refills of soda water with lemon at no extra charge. The food was epic but what really stayed with me is the dining experience in general. Needless to say I left a generous tip and would definitely go back again and again. This place is a gem!!"}
{"text":"We came on their first night back open, and their beer selection is ample, and their fish and chips is fantastic. You cannot ask for more from an Irish pub!"}
{"text":"Great place! The co-bar manager Mike was very proficient in his knowledge for their cocktails and what each ingredient taste like individually to get you the final product profile. I had the \"Rob Rye\" and it was exactly what he said it would taste like \" A Sharp Manhattan\" and I LOVED it! I also had the Smoked Marrow which were pretty good. I had a mishap with one of my marrow bones being under-cooked, but the bartender/server Kieren(excuse spelling) saw that it was under-cooked and went and got the chef to make me another piece without me asking! If that is not the definition of \"good Server\" I don't know what is.   A great place, and I really liked all the people that worked their as well as their clientele. I will be back if I ever visit that area again!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food or service. The fish n chips are amazing  as us the Fisherman's stew. The Pub burger is very tasty. We go regularly. Try a Flaming Irish Coffee, fun to watch and very tasty"}
{"text":"Visiting Champaign on business and stumbled onto this great Irish pub.   First of all the decor is very traditional Irish.  Second & more importantly is they call a Snakebite a Snakebite, not  Black Velvet or one of the other abominations.  I ate before I found this gem, so no food for me.  I'll eat the next time I'm in town.   Juan was great too.  Slainte!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dublin O'Neill's three times now - should have written a review the first two times but did not.  Our friends wanted to go Tuesday night - husband and I weren't too keen on it given that we didn't just love DO the first two times but they really like it so we went along.  Like others, like the setting of the place, nice ambiance.  However, it is so dim that we had trouble seeing the menu - had to hold my cell phone over it so that I could read.  It would be nice to have a sconce or down-light of some type on the tables for reading the menu and eating.    On our first visit to DO, I had the mac and cheese.  I'm a huge mac and cheese lover and maker.  Sometimes the cheeses used in various recipes are good for some people but not for others.  The taste just hit me wrong so I must not have liked the flavor of one of the cheeses, not DO's fault.  Hubby had a burger that time and it just had a strong flavor that he did not like.  We also had trouble getting drink refills that day.  Second time we went, sat outside on a lovely summer day.  This time hubby and friend ordered the fish and chips which they thought was really good.  I on the other hand ordered the beef short ribs and was sorely, sorely disappointed.  When the plate was put in front of me, I thought - this is the most unappetizing looking mess I've seen lately on a plate.  It looked like something that you'd had for dinner the previous night and reheated the next day for lunch.  It was not heated properly, the gravy was congealed like it had not been heated properly, and the meat was tough.  I barely ate any of it - when the waitress picked our dishes up, she paused when she saw my plate but then did nothing.  I read another person's review below that her ribs were also not hot enough.  I probably should have complained but did not........... thankfully we were going to Jarling's afterwards!  So this time, we went on a Tuesday night -- DO was probably only about a third full.  One lady was waitressing the restaurant.  My meal was pretty good on this third try but it was the service that struggled this time.  (I ordered the salmon with red wine reduction sauce, mac and cheese (which was more tolerable, for me, as a side serving than as an entrée), and grilled asparagus.  All was good and the salmon had a nice crispy grilled exterior that I love.)  The three other people in our group all had fish and chips.  Compared to last time, the serving size of the fish and chips seemed different / smaller to them.  One is a big eater so may be last time he'll want to go here.    The two things that were really off service-wise - a gentleman came to our table, said he was the owner, and could he get any condiments for our meals?  The three fish-and-chippers asked for ketchup.  He comes back with a bottle that is barely a quarter full......... really?!  You have no other ketchup bottles in the restaurant that are fuller than that?  And he was the owner.  Afterwards when we talked about it, we thought - what kind of red flag is that for running a restaurant if the owner can't even get you a full bottle of ketchup?  Then, no salt/pepper shakers on the table, one fish-and-chipper asked for a salt shaker.  He had received his entrée so needed the salt shaker now - waited, waited.  He was halfway through his meal before a salt shaker showed up.  We were joking that maybe they only had one for the whole restaurant so we had to wait our turn?!    What's interesting is that it was announced in the paper that DO is expanding into the space next door.  They can't seem to handle the service on their current space?  I suppose DO is successful for the beer side of the restaurant but for the food side - to us, the menu seems small, and what they do have on the menu is sometimes not done well (i.e. the ribs).    (P.S.  We also ordered some of the Irish soda bread for an appetizer the first or second time - IMHO it was like buttering up flavorless pieces of cardboard.......... Would never order it again.)"}
{"text":"The Irish nachos and seafood chowder are  both wonderful. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is nice and casual!"}
{"text":"We had late lunch on a Saturday and the place was fairly empty.  Nice small place with a few tables outside.  Food was tasty, our server was awesome, funny and friendly.  I had veg pot pie, which was good, tasted very homemade.  My husband had a meatball sandwich and a scotch egg.  Not the best scotch egg he's ever had (Broad Ripple Brew Pub, Indiana) but the sandwich was ok.  Fun place, but kind of pricey for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Does this place have the best bar food and drinks I've ever had? No. Is it pretty damn good for the area it's in? Yes. It's especially good on the weekends, and at late night hours. Their soda bread and cheese curds are super yummy, and their pizza is pretty good. Drink-wise they have a good selection of beers, and their mimosas on the weekends taste awesome. My favorite is letting the bartenders surprise me after telling them what type of drink I want. Never been disappointed. Their Irish Coffee is BOMB, real fire and all. If you're cool to the bartenders, they really take care of you and they're great conversation. One of my go-to places, and I definitely prefer bar seating. They also have an Irish band play once a week which is fun."}
{"text":"Irish nachos were great! They also had fantastic music. A little more quiet on a Friday night but the service was very attentive and nice, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I'm a bit of a sucker for Irish fare in general, but the atmosphere here takes it a step further. Small and intimate with dark woods and nice artistic accents. I've had just about everything on the menu and the only thing I was unimpressed with was the roasted chicken. Definitely try the fisherman's stew! It's sooo goooood. The corned beef and cabbage is amazing, the shepherd's pie is so savory and the bangers and mash are just wonderful. They do a great snakebite too (which down in Chambana is Guinness and cider, not Guinness and Harp)"}
{"text":"We came here for NYE '13 dinner. About halfway through our dinner, a country/folk? band started performing extremely depressing songs. not my idea of new years cheer.   The food was awesome! I loved every bite of it! Our waitress asked us to order the specials since they were competing to sell the most. I thought that was unprofessional and uncomfortable. All four of us ended up getting a special, but not because she had requested it.  The ribs were to die for. the meat was tender and the truffles/ mushrooms were cooked well. I don't know if this special will be offered again, but if it is, i highly recommend it.  Minus a star because they won't make an irish coffee. My bf ordered one and they would only serve him one of their fancy drinks. how hard is it to put whisky into coffee at a restaurant with a bar?"}
{"text":"This used to be \"our place.\"   My wife and I frequented this establishment for years.  But recently they changed ownership and management and everything that made this place good is gone.  The interesting and delicious options like the wild boar fennel sausage and the Jameson vinaigrette are gone and have been replaced with generic pub food.  We gave it another chance tonight and man was it bad.  My Guinness was served in a glass with a hole in it so it leaked all over the table. We weren't offered waters. My child's meal of mac and cheese came out nearly cold. My wife ordered the fish sandwich and it was served with a condiment package of tarter sauce like you would get at a fast food joint.  I ordered a salad and it was just a huge bowl of lettuce with nothing really on it.  And it tasted like a salt shaker had been dumped into it.  I'm so sad that a fun little spot with actual good, interesting food is now gone.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"New spot in downtown.. well, I guess new to me.  I remember when this place was just being built during one of my last visits to U-C.  Anyways, it's a cute little Irish pub.  Shares a kitchen with the place next door.. owned by the same person.    Tried the fish and chips.. it was good but didn't taste awesome.  I think it has more to do with the fact that I just went to London where I had amazing fish and chips so it was not as good.  I know.. comparisons can be a little unfair.    What was amazing was their $3 Moscow Mules on Monday night.  Yes.. you read correctly.  I pay right now $10-15 for this in LA.. so for this with Tito's is amazing.  Bartender is friendly.. he's my friend's friend so he was pouring us Glenrothes (one of my fav whiskeys) and anything else we fancied.  Waitress was amazing.. could separate the bill for about 10 of us.  Now that's an amazing waitress."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place because they had authentic, or as close as one can get, Irish food. Blood pudding, potatoes cakes, Irish stew, calcannon, at cetera. Now their menus has just shepherds pie, corned beef and scotch eggs. But, you can now get some curry shrimp from this \"Irish Pub\". Come on guys, the food is just okay now. And, this restaurant won't do well with competitors like DESTIHL, Seven Saints and others focusing on great pub food. And places like the Himalayan Chimney, Miga, and others focusing on awesome Indian, and Asian fare.  I'm very disappointed and I don't think I have a reason to bring anyone here anymore, at least not until they get their identity sorted out."}
{"text":"I will start with the service was excellent. We had a new waitress who was training,  and she was still great at it.   As for the food. My group ordered the irish nachos. They were yummy,  but the topping to chip ratio was off  they need to layer some cheese lower, cause the one they use hardens fast, so it's hard to get a bit on each chip. The amount of corn beef could have been slightly more, but it tasted great.  My irish breakfast however was a mess. My eggs were burnt, I ordered them sunny side up, and the yolks while runny, we're starting to get that white film over them from being cooked to long, the bottoms were brown and the edges were brown and crispy, I mean this was something that was so obviously wrong. The bangers (sausage) were a bit to vinegary for my taste, and again one was a bit burnt. The tomato was only a few slices and they were super over seasoned,  all I tasted was a super spicy tomato, they need to hold off on that a lot!. The white and black puddings were tasty. Their rashers also had a burnt taste to them and they were super tough. They look like they had been cooked over a grill,  it made them taste almost exclusively of charcoal.  The roasted potatoes... well they turned out to be french fries (super disappointing)  and the irish soda bread had had a great flavor but was also super dense."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in for an early dinner at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday.  We put in our names and hung around for 50 minutes, enjoying drinks and appetizers at the bar before being seated.  Even with a few tables opening up in the patio with the nice weather, this place is cramped and claustrophobic.  By the end of the meal, we had people's butts bumping into our faces as there was only standing room and we were seated at a table of normal height.  Probably one of the loudest bars I've visited in Champaign.  It's not that they blast music at obnoxious volumes, but the acoustics of the room amplify people's voices into a deafening jargon.  I was screaming in my friends' faces for most of our meal.  I guess I would recommend this place if you have hopes of getting cozy and face-to-face with a date.  Food was hit-or-miss for me.  The menu claims that their meat products are sourced from local farms (though I didn't inquire further).  My friends and I shared an appetizer of sweet potato chips, which had a nice dusting of curry powder on top.  For dinner, I had the fisherman's stew: the seafood was nicely cooked, but I didn't bother finishing the tomato broth, which was overpowering and somewhat jarring with the delicate seafood.  Since 50% of the bowl is filled with shells of various sea creatures (as you'd expect from ordering anything with mixed seafood), it makes a pretty light meal.  My friend absolutely loved the corned beef and cabbage, which was hearty and robust (I saw many plates of this popular dish being passed around the restaurant).  The dish is a little more refined than traditional corned beef; Dublin O'Neil's uses red cabbage and kale mashed potatoes in place of the usual boiled veggies.  Another friend said he always comes on Friday for the lunch special: meatloaf with some kind of spicy sauce concocted in the restaurant next door (301 Mongolia).  Drinks are very much on the affordable side, with every 20-oz. draught around $5.  There's also quite an extensive list of bottles and spirits, though given the competition between bars in town, it probably doesn't have the most absurdly obscure things.  I felt like the Irish theme here was kind of forced and contrived, but I appreciated that the bartender knew how to make and serve a snakebite (snakebite = 1/2 Harp Lager + 1/2 Magner's Cider).  This is the perfect summer beverage, and I'll be stopping by Dublin O'Neil's over the next few months solely for this drink."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. Had the shephard's pie, the gf had the fish n chips. Portions were large for the money and good quality to boot. My only knock would be that the service was very slow. It took a long time to get the appetizer and an equally long time to get our mains."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for Irish nachos and a whiskey sour, but they recently changed ownership and the nachos are now pretty gross. They have some weird \"salsa\" and don't come with corned beef unless you pay extra for it. I didn't try anything else while I was there this time, but if they screwed that up that badly I don't feel inclined to try anything else on the menu. They make their whiskey sours differently now too, which was also disappointing."}
{"text":"I have a mixed opinion on this place.  I've been there a couple of times for lunch, but never dinner.  I find the place reasonably priced, and the meal portions quite large (aka, that's a good thing.)  I've had a chicken pot pie, and some other chicken meal.  It was like a grilled chicken sandwich.  Both were very large portions, and are heavier feeling going down.   This is rich, savory food.    Anyway, my chicken pot pie was good, though took long to come out.  About 40 minutes and it wasn't too busy.  My chicken breast sandwich came out sooner, but I had to send it back because it was not done in the middle.  Fortunately it came back better, and I avoided any possible food sickness.    Service was always friendly, but not always fast.  Waits were on the longer side, even on non busy days.  I also had a friend that did get food sickness from some seafood dish from one of the two times I went.    All and all, not my type of place, but what I experienced was not bad.  I hear the bar/pub scene of this place is of more appeal than the food, but I only have gone for the food."}
{"text":"Moved back down to school for Spring semester and got lunch here with my mother.  We were looking for something local and unique that was good for lunch, Dublin O'Neil's fit this bill.  There was only a few people in the place around 2pm on MLK day.  The inside is very nice. Dark, pub-style furniture in a somewhat small, but well-decorated room.  No drinks for us this visit, but the drink menu is extensive and has some unique offerings that I will definitely be back to try.  We started with the Irish nachos which were okay, but in my opinion could have used more of the toppings and less of the chips. Still, the made in-house chips were tasty.   We were disappointed to hear they were out of several key items.  I got the wild boar fennel sausage sandwich and my mother got the reuben. Both sandwiches were very unique. My boar sausage was flavorful and mixed well with the onion and sauce on it. The herb French fries that I got with it were delicious too. My mom really enjoyed her reuben. It was different in that it did not have sauerkraut but rather a pickled pink cabbage instead, which she thought was an interesting take on a traditional sandwich.  Both sandwiches were expensive and perhaps a little skimpy on the portion for being close to $15/plate. I feel that the uniqueness and food quality of the dishes overshadows the portion size and price though.  The service was good, our server was calm, cool and collective but was very nice.  I'll definitely be back to try the drinks and of course more food."}
{"text":"I went back last night for some late night food and drinks after a movie, and need to update this a bit.  The food and drinks are great.  Seafood Chowder and potato pancakes with smoked salmon are amazing.  I am addicted to their steamed mussels.  The food is still excellent.  Enjoyed some Two Brothers on tap, Baily's and Coffee for my buddy, and they had an Irish like folk band playing that was really good.  The service was horrific.  There might have been two other full tables besides us, along with just two or three people at the bar.  The place was not packed at all.  It was damn near impossible to get served.  The waitress would not even look at us most the night.  I don't know what happened?  During a nearly full lunch hour, the service was spot on before.  We could not even get our bill after asking several times.  Really, you guys don't want to get money for the meal and drinks?  OK, fine with me.  We ended up just putting some cash on the table and left.    I am thinking of taking off another star.  Though the food, vibe, and drinks was still excellent."}
{"text":"Dublin O'Neil's is one of those places with outstanding ambience and excellent food. The Irish Nachos are incredible. The seafood chowder may be the best chowder I've had anywhere. The macaroni and cheese is absolutely excellent with solid overtones of smoked Gouda. The only thing that made me grade them down is a lack of a kids menu. (Not difficult to add if they'd just do it.)  The draught beer selection is also excellent. I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the first time I was pretty happy. They weren't very busy, and we were in and out quickly. However, the next 2 times were just awful.   The second time I went the waiter knew about TWO of the beers on the menu. If you're going to carry an extensive beer list, especially with specialty beers that people may be unfamiliar with, PLEASE have a knowledgeable staff. My fish and chips were soggy and I was generally disappointed.   Because my first experience was good, I decided they might have had an off day. I gave them another shot, and after an EXTREMELY long wait for both our table and our food, I ended up with a lovely case of food poisoning. From reading other reviews, this isn't an uncommon occurrence.   This place had great potential, but poor service and food safety killed it for me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very laid back atmosphere, cozy, and overall aesthetically pleasing. Mike was an excellent server and he gave us a few suggestions since it was our first time there. The mac and cheese is the best I've ever had. The chicken pot pie is top notch. Finally, if you have room for dessert, GET THE BREAD PUDDING! Great dining experience. Great service. Great food. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They just redid their menu which is good because I was quickly bored with the options here. Their food is a lot more reasonably priced than similar restaurants in the area and the quality is pretty good but sometimes their menu can seem limited. Certain dishes are better than others and even ones that sound interesting can turn out to be rather bland. They also frequently repeat specials so there's rarely something that I haven't tried.  The bloody mary's we had yesterday were pretty great! and well seasoned. Could be more creative with the garnish though.  On another note, the service can be hit or miss. Yesterday we experienced wonderful service but just last January four of us had to seat ourselves after standing in the front of the restaurant and being ignored for 20 minutes and then sitting down and being ignored for another 20 minutes until we even got to see menus."}
{"text":"First time here on a Sunday night, love irish fare so looking forward to it.  Shepard pie is lamb as it should be and wife rated as 'OK'  /  I had a favorite 'Bangers & Mash' and would eat them again.  Beer selection was good as was the service.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place amazing scotch eggs the best and great chicken pot pie. Our bartender server Megan was awesome. We hope to come back when pass through again. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch. I had the Irish breakfast! The portion is generous, but there's nothing really special about it. I came here mostly because they have deals for brunch bloody mary (was it $3)."}
{"text":"It was too expensive for the amount and quality that you get. the atmosphere is great, but we were the only people in there and it took a long time to get our food. Im a college student and my meal was double the price amount I'm used to spending with half the amount of food. Many people in my party went home and ended up cooking something else for themselves. maybe a place to go if its a special occasion but their food is not spectacular. I can see why some people may like it but im not going back."}
{"text":"The service was subpar but the FOOD! I had the small chicken pot pie and it was incredible. Small is the perfect size. Large would be huge and make two meals. The ambiance is awesome and good vibes of Irish heritage. I want to go back right now!"}
{"text":"Went back on Wednesday, under the new ownership. Girlfriend ordered the mac and cheese with bangers, I ordered the fish and chips, as the menu seemed sparse. After ordering, I go outside to do outside things, and sitting on one of the patio tables was a list of \"today's specials\" which probably would have been nice to see. Not that I could really see the menu inside. The lighting is very low, and there is a weird font, and the descriptions are in a shade that blends perfectly in with that lighting. Had I seen the specials menu, I would have gone with the tenderloin. While I was outside, Clifford hobbled past. He asked how I was doing, but didn't ask for money, which was weird. He still seemed angry, but he's just got that disposition I think . When asking people for money, you probably want to be a little bit more friendly, and not come off as a very angry person.  Go inside and the food comes out. The fish and chips is served with waffle fries. I find this very odd. They were ok, I guess. But I've never had waffle fries with fish and chips. It's supposed to be fries, like... fries fries, not waffle fries. One doesn't drench waffle fries in malt vinegar. It just didn't seem right. The mac and cheese, ordered with bangers, was an accident, she meant rashers, she wanted bacon, not sausage. That's her fault though. I tried some of the bangers, and it seemed way overpowering of ... was that ... rosemary? Well, that was a learning experience for her, rashers, not bangers.  Overall, it was ok, I guess. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, was... ok. There are many other options for ok."}
{"text":"To satisfy my craving for a good chicken pot pie, I opened my Yelp app to check out the nearby restaurants serving pot pies. I stumbled upon this restaurant, which had decent reviews, grabbed my husband and came here. Servers were friendly and we were seated immediately. We ordered chicken pot pie, onion rings, fish & chips and a side of Mac & cheese. I loved the chicken pot pie, the pastry as flaky and the stuffing had good amount of vegetables and chicken. I would have preferred a little thick stuffing but still it tasted great. Fish was flaky but it was too oily, same for onion rings. They were so oily that I had to press indivual onion ring between paper towel to get the oil out. But sadly, it took the crispiness out too :(. Mac & cheese tasted awesome. Loved it. It was a mixed experience. I will definitely go here again for Mac & cheese and chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Excellent food choice in the Bangers and Mash. The service was great. Inside felt a bit small. The Nitro IPA was flat, but the Bent River IPA was decent. I would return again to try some of the other dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Went for the famous cod fish sandwich! Don't waste your time or money... The fish was cold and it wasn't even fresh fried but baked in a cool oven or warmer. So disappointed....the fries were at least average. Wait till the famous fish is over!"}
{"text":"Food is only so so.  Making shepherd's pie with beef betrays the inauthentic nature of the place  - call it cottage pie or make it with lamb only.  Service was terrible - My friends and I will not be going back."}
