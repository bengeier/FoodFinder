{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic service, very fair prices and portions! Love coming here! Make a reservation as it's busy - especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, rich, authentic flavours. Friendly, efficient service.  Every dish was a hit. The Paneer Makhani (same creamy, tomato sauce as butter chicken) was the star.  Baigan Patiala was smokey and fragrant with tender slices of eggplant and mashed eggplant and spices. Chicken Pasanda was also excellent and full of saffron flavour. Ras Malai had a perfect, delicate texture and just the right amount of creamy, fragrant sweetness. Definitely the best Indian restaurant I've been to in a while, and the best in North Toronto.  A strong recommendation.  Great for couples or small parties of 4 (maybe 6 max) as dining room is very cozy.  Definitely make a reservation for weekend dinners."}
{"text":"Decent food. BUT ...  Got the dinner for 2 take out special. They clearly were in it to rip me off. The special is 40.95 + tax with a 10% discount when you pay cash. I asked why my bill came out to 47 something when it arrived. they said it must have been a mistake when I was quoted the number over the phone. The man said it very smug. Sure enough, I checked the menu online and they had charged me for the individual items versus the special which is what I asked for.   Not a way to run a business. Make sure you check your bill."}
{"text":"Top notch Indian cuisine in a little place in north york. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"What's the difference between butter chicken and tomato water with chicken in it? Nothing if you order it from Copper Chimney.  I've eaten here for about 18 months and watched it go from mediocre to utterly disgusting over this time. They have switched owners 3 times and none of them are able to operate it.  On to the food, I wouldn't bother ordering any of it. This butter chicken I am eating right now it awful. I don't think there is any butter whatsoever. Granted this is no Mango Shiva, but you would think an Indian couple would be able to put out something that resembles butter chicken. It seriously tastes like tomato water. I can't even smell curry in it. Their mixed vegetables are gross and I'm not brave enough to try anything else they have on their menu, based on what I have on my plate now.  Don't waste your time. Let this place sink so they can replace it with a restaurant that is able to serve cuisine."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Quick and efficient service. Atmosphere was standard for a good Indian restaurant, ie. clean but not particularly interesting. Would definitely go back. Probably the best traditional Indian food I've had in Toronto. The grill platter is a great way to start your meal."}
{"text":"Copper Chimney has the perfect essence of an Indian platter. It's a must visit place if you want to enjoy a quiet Indian dinner. Their portions are great and eash dish is really tasty. We loved the lamb rack or rogan josh as it was called. Don't forget to reserve as it's always full."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the neighborhood and have really enjoyed dining here. It was on our \"go to\" list for situations where we decide not to cook at the last minute and, instead, want to grab something close to home.   Last week she mentioned that she read that they had been shut down by the health department so I went to the Toronto Dine Safe site. Yikes!  Conditional pass in March followed by a shut down in July. The offenses listed are awful...    We won't be returning. It's a shame because the food was good."}
{"text":"Oddly, we have never actually dined at The Copper Chimney as we have it delivered. The dinner for two is enough for two meals...very generous portions. The chicken pasanda is my partners ultimate favourite and is terrific indeed. All of the beef and lamb dishes are wonderful. The daal tadka and daal bukhara are faves as well. The rice portion is on the smaller side and we often order two for extra rice for leftovers...not an issue at all. The very best Indian in Toronto as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"I think I've finally found my go-to place for Indian food. There are a lot of Indian restaurants in the Yonge and Eglinton area, but unfortunately they are all very average. I was glad when I found out about this place because it was just a 10 minute drive away.  The restaurant is small and cozy. The waiters and staff are all very pleasant. Our waiter, SIngh, was very patient with all of our questions about the menu. We ordered two appetizers, two main dishes and some wine. Their samosas were huge, and the garlic vegetable balls were one of the best things I've ever tried. You MUST try them!  The main courses are very reasonably priced. The service is quick and prompt; the waiter always made sure our glasses were full. The food was outstanding and on par with some of the 'high-end' Indian restaurants I've tried in the past.   The restaurant did get busy around 7:30. There are limited seats, so if you have a large group (4 or more) you are safer by making a reservation.   I am definitely going back to this place very soon."}
{"text":"They now have a location in Gulf Canada Square on 9th Avenue SW. I wish I'd read the reviews before choosing to satisfy my Indian craving here. Not only was the butter chicken more like frozen chicken in a tomato soup, the naan bread was straight out of a package from the grocery store, lightly browned, buttered and served to me. I really would not have minded so much if I didn't just pay 11 dollars for a mediocre meal that did nothing to satisfy my cravings. That doesn't even include a drink. Needless to say I will not be dining here again. Overpriced fake Indian food."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends late Saturday night on a recommendation from my friend's coworker, so it wasn't terribly busy. First thing I noticed that the place was a little fancy, what with wine glasses and everything - luckily I was a little dressed up! It also smelled absolutely AMAZING. We were promptly seated and handed menus.  I ordered butter chicken (I can't handle spiciness) and the food was quite fast in arriving. It tasted delicious and certainly did its job filling me up; the only thing I'd complain about is that it all the orders don't come with rice or naan, so they cost extra. I got the naan, but luckily they were quite generous and gave me four pieces. My friends ordered rice and were similarly satisfied.  The service was pretty good, except they forgot my friend's drink and didn't deliver it until after we'd finished eating. Price was reasonable for the food - it's not \"expensive\", but certainly isn't cheap either. I don't go out for Indian food often, but I'm glad I tried this place out!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Have dined here for several years.  This is one of the only Indian restaurants where I can happily dine without heartburn afterwards (I don't usually get heartburn, even to spicy foods...only to Indian food).  I've tried many other delicious Indian restos, but sadly, experience heartburn that make me regret my meal.    This visit to Copper Chimney was on a Thursday night, and it was good thing we had a reservation; the place was packed at 7pm.  Per many of the reviews, the food is really good.  I do find, however, that some of their dishes are too drenched in sauce - The Chili lime wings are flavourful, but were covered in too much sauce, as were the garlic veggie balls.  In some of the dishes that come with sauce (Paneer Makhani and Butter chicken), there was too much sauce, and too little paneer / chicken.  I know some people love using the sauce for dipping their naan, or saucing the rice, but overall, the servings could've been a little more generous.  The wine pricing is decent though;  and when we polished off a bottle and ordered extra glasses, the pours were very generous.  Service was competent and efficient;  there was a constant line at the door, as well as constant take-out orders being picked up.  And once again, no heartburn after this yummy Indian meal!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Authentic and fresh.  Not overpriced as we expected for the location.  Recommended to several others who have enjoyed the food just as much."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real pleasant change. I've become pretty intolerant to bad service and food over the years especially as prices seem to just go up and up without reason. So it was a great surprise to find The Copper Chimney. We had intended to visit another restaurant in the block but found it closed. In attempting to eat at an Asian restaurant in the same block we left after a futile waiting period in which the waitress just kept telling everyone \"One minute\" and then nothing happened. So we were really happy that this fine Indian restaurant was also in the same block. Good flavourful food, great aromas, pleasant atmosphere,no TVs-- great, well priced and really accommodating. My young son didn't want to eat some of the food as he found it too spicy. When I asked if they would make something off the menu, they gladly made it  and it arrived quite quickly. All the food was hot and arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Food is clearly made to order. A bit of slippage on the language, but that is typical in almost any ethnic restaurant. Another reviewer mentioned health standards, of which I looked at their record. Clearly that is in the past.   Short of going to Little India, around the GTA, this restaurant really has made a good effort."}
{"text":"Another one of our regular eateries.  The food and service here are excellent! The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly, and the servers are personable and professional.   My only (small) qualm is that they don't serve Kashmiri Nan; the bread with dried fruits and cashews inside - I was in India several times for long periods, and it was one of my favourites.  That being said, whenever I want to get a little reminder of my times in Delhi or Manali or Dharamsala, all I have to do is swing by The Copper Chimney, and the flavours are there to take me back again :-)"}
{"text":"living in the york centre area, indian restaurants are somewhat limited but having discovered copper chimney, i've been very satisfied with the quality of dishes here. my partner and i are able to enjoy indian dishes for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  we've only ever done take-out, and for the price, you get alot of food!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but attitude is awful. Girl at the front is arrogant and rude. I would not waste my time with this place. There are better Indian Restaurants in the city. Stay clear."}
{"text":"Good Indian place. The food is great. If you are coming in the evening you better call to make a reservation as it gets busy. The parking is paid Street parking but not expensive and there is lots usually. Service is average. I would recommend the prawn coconut curry, last time we tried it it was awesome."}
{"text":"Bad food and very bad service. AVOID the place if you want to have a decent meal. Would recommend going to Banjara or Lahore tikka or any place, just not this."}
{"text":"We arrived 45 minutes before the closing time and we were turned away rudely by the restaurant folks. Staff were unhelpful and rude. As per the rich Indian tradition guest is treated like god and this restaurant is definitely not following this rich Indian tradition. I have eaten once here before and i liked the food. I will never come here again for their rude behavior."}
{"text":"A very authentic Indian restaurant and kind boss. We ordered the food based on his suggestion, chicken, lamb, naan, rice...everything is good, and mongo lassi, wonderful taste!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Restaurant was a bit noisy, but the ambiance was still enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went last week to try this place.  Beforehand,  I checked their website to scope the menu prices etc. .  Real dissapointed to see the website is pretty outdated   For how long,  I don't know , although most prices for mains were 3-4 dollars higher,  appetizers 2-3 bucks off. as well rice and Naan bread were separate charges.  5.00 for rice .Website advertised a special dinner for two to 8 people.  Jackass  manager tried to ssy it was for takeout only. Give me a break Saheeb . Overall , food was pretty tasty and of high quality. Too bad the surprise pricing and idiotic explanations given left a real bad taste in your mouth.  BTW , avoid the $10 95 vegetable garlic balls .Simply horrible.  I warned you."}
{"text":"Awesome solid Indian restaurant. Not the best atmosphere but food more than compensates."}
{"text":"Would give this place a 3.5. Went here on recommendation by a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. Hard to find Indian restaurants that are cosy. This place is pretty small, but very small and intimate. Probably great for a date and wasn't too loud.   The portions sizes are small, but it's nice to order family style so you can try a bit of everything. I tried the butter chicken, one of my favorite dishes, saag paneer and chicken biryani. They give you a traditional indian appetizer that's like a really thin, super crispy crepe.   The service was fast and friendly.   The biryani wasn't the best... everyone has their preferences but it was a bit too much cinnamony for me, not very spicy, though. The yogurt that it comes with is sweet, which it shouldnt be so don't douse your rice with it before trying!  The butter chicken was decent, but very mild in flavor in spice. The saag paneer, a spinach with an Indian cheese, was probably the best. And the garlic naans were one of the best I've had.  Overall, the food probably won't blow you away, but it seems like a nice spot for a quick lunch or a casual dinner. It's probably a good place to try Indian food if you aren't familiar with it because it's not too spicy like more traditional, hole-in-the-wall joints."}
{"text":"These guys are stupid .I called in for delivery and  the Guys said he won't take my order because he doesn't want to tell me the menu over the call and said \"i Should know their menu \"  These guys need to have some customer service classes ."}
{"text":"Picked up local Indian for a last minute meal last night.  Service was quick. Didn't have to wait too long. Even a cash discount!   Ordered two chicken dishes, rice and some garlic naan. Butter chicken was bang on. Fan favourite was the rice and the showstopper was the naan. A must try place for a weekday takeout!"}
{"text":"Food is really good,  but the waiter was terrible. No humble. Just \"I know people with money come here,  so everyone has to be like that\". No humble."}
{"text":"After trying other places, places considered to be the best Indian food in Toronto, this is till by far our favorite place. The food is authentic and delicious every time, the owner is very friendly and we always get greeted at the door, cozy atmosphere and decent prices, couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the neighbourhood by far.  Beyond that, this is probably my favourite Indian food joint in the city.  The food is always perfect and the staff are always helpful and friendly.  I highly encourage you to try this place."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday around 7:30 pm and there was a line up.   The food and the service was excellent,  this will be my new go to Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a WONDERFUL indian restaurant! I loved the staff, the service, and the food. The prices are very reasonable, and the portions are good. The curry actually had quite a lot of meat in them, which was surprising, given many other restaurants usually cheap out on the meat front. The restaurant itself is kept very clean, and is quiet, and has a romantic environment. I loved it here, and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Having read some good reviews for this place on a food related forum I jumped on the opportunity to dine here when a fellow Yelp Eating Buddy (YEB) said they were heading there.  YEB made a reservation and I showed up a bit early. The place was busy even though it was the middle of the week plenty of reserved tables and then the dining area started filling up. I ordered a glass of Shiraz while I waited for my YEB. I went through the menu and the lamb nalli (shank) caught my eye as it was mentioned as a specialty.  I was checked on regularly and my wine was poured in promptly. Finally YEB came and after a going through the menu settled with Chicken Vindaloo and asked for it spicy. The server suggested we order both Naan and Rice. We thought two mains should suffice. They give out free pappadums with mint sauce. Meh nothing to write home about. The mains were served in a reasonable amount of time. The lamb looked good but vindaloo looked like a tiny portion.  Anyway I was starving so went ahead and started eating. The Lamb shank were obviously reheated as you can't braise shanks so fast. The taste was below average with the base of the sauce over powering the spices. As for the vindaloo the first bite was hot but it mellowed out after that (they use chicken breast and dark meat would have given more body to this dish IMO) but I think it was more authentic of the two mains.   I can see this place appealing to western tastes but is too mellowed down to be authentic. Total damage almost 50$ for two and I was still hungry! Service was good but when you factor in the food 2.5 star overall."}
{"text":"I really love this place, good quality food, good portioning, good service, and moderately priced for this neighbourhood. Portions are a bit more generous with take out and you can receive a 10% discount if you pay with cash. It is often quite busy around dinner time so you should make a reservation or call in advance as seating is limited. Occasionally the kitchen is a little slow last time i ordered take out they told me to come pick up in half hour and when I arrived I still had to wait about 15 mins to receive my order.  Their butter chicken is delicious with nice chunks of chicken breast and a rich sauce. All their briyani is tasty but they leave large chunks of seeds and other spices that can be gross to bite into and throws off your pallet for a while."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty regularly.  Tuesday is our favourite day because diners receive 10%off. We usually get the butter chicken, vegetable korma, naan.  I enjoy the food and find the flavours very nice.bread is amazing!  This week the butter chicken was also very god though I would say that the chicken could be a bit more tender.  Of course we will come again to this place.  The service is great as well.  Decor is slightly outdated, in my opinion. Tweaks could have me give them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Indian place in Toronto.  It is nicely decorated, cozy and comfortable inside.  The wait staff is awesome.  And best of all, the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Good indian. Great meat thali plate. I guess they were closed, but they're open again."}
{"text":"Walking into this place and you can tell from the aroma that life is going to take you on a journey right now.   You can trust this place as it does not take the typical indian AYCE approach. Instead you have options from all over the indian hemisphere with multiple different curry styles- both vegetarian and non.  The best part is the service is great here- as both the servers and owner will create dialogue to keep tabs thru-out the course of your meal- but in the most subtle and non-invasive fashion.  The food is the perfect blend of spices. Really good.   Avenue road has some gems. This  place is one of them.  Tip: For cost effectiveness look for the dinner for 2 combo's if you are doing delivery.."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from Copper Chimney since they first opened-- I stopped eating there after I found a piece of plastic in my food but recently gave them a second chance and have been so happy.   The food here is delicious and the service is great. It is pricier for the portions you get but the food is always so well seasoned, juicy, and flavourful."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on blogto.com's list of best Indian restaurants in Toronto.  The two of us ate - the complementary tubular papadams, - (veggie) samosas, - daal bukhara (stewed black lentils), - lamb masala, - a side of rice and a rosemary naan, - a lassi to wash it all down.  It was delicious, much higher quality than we normally find in restaurants. The location is in an area of shops that is a few blocks long but not excessively trendy...  I think this is why the prices were very reasonable, $23 per person after tax and tip.  The food was excellent... the samosas were light and fluffy, the sauces tasty and fresh, the rice was well-perfumed (including *two* kinds of cardamom), and the main dishes were frigging delicious. The naan was fantastic and freshly made, although I don't think the rosemary added much.  Good engineering: we have never seen papadams rolled in tubes before. Pretty fun presentation, and makes it easier to dip.  Bad engineering: the lassi was too thick to drink with the small-diameter straw they provided. We added a bit more water to it and then it was fine."}
{"text":"Had take-out on new Year's day...one of the few places opened!!!  We ordered quite a bit since there was a group of us 1.  Methi peas 2.  muttar paneer 3.  butter chicken 4. lamb rohanjosh 5. aloo gobi 6.  bindhi 7.  dhal tarka 8. channa masala 9. chicken tikka 10.  eggplant 11.  garlic vegetable balls (but they didn't show up) hmm can't remember if there was anything else...portion sizes were decent unless you ordered the meat dishes, then you get lots of sauce for dipping in.  Containers were the black round plastic ones which I think are a decent size for take out.    Overall we were pleased with our meal.  They don't cook anything spicy at all so good for the 'north american' palate.  Basmati rice was nicely done and served in white styrofoam containers (so a good size) Overall I thought it was good value for the money.  It's not like the deals you'd get in brampton or missisauga but for Toronto...this was good"}
{"text":"I decided to drop by for a quick dinner Friday night just after 6pm before we did some Christmas shopping at Yorkdale Mall. This was my first time at this particular establishment.  I ordered the butter chicken and my friend ordered the saag lamb with naan and rice.  The butter chicken was good, it wasn't too sweet, it was spiced correctly at least for me. The only problem was that the chicken was not as tender as I would like.  My friend ordered the saag lamb and it was good, I have tried saag lamb at other restaurants in Toronto and it's a lot better than most. Nice flavour, texture and the lamb used was very tender and flavourful.  The naan bread and rice were good.  The service was really good, we were served by a young gentleman who looked under 30 for sure. He was patient explaining different dishes to us, checked up on us on a regular basis to see if we needed anything and to fill our water glasses but not to the point where he was overbearing.  Overall, the place doesn't blow you away but it definitely is better than most in Toronto and is very price competitive."}
{"text":"Good quality indian food. Portions are generous. Flavours are far too bland to be truly considered Indian cuisine. The Copper Chimney is a good place to go if you are hesitant to try the great & strong spices and flavours that makes Indian cuisine so rich and tasty."}
{"text":"So I am allocated 42 dollars for supper while traveling. When you think about it with tax and a drink or two you can surpass that fairly quickly.  But I will admit it was not easy to do at the Copper Chimney.  We arrived as a group of four, place seemed full and I could tell there was a possibility we would be leaving fairly quickly when it came as a shock to the host we had not made reservations for this Friday night.  Well, they just took the reserved card right off a table and gave it to us.  They could probably tell by my open toe sandals and Nebraska Corn Huskers hat I was going to be drinking a lot of high margin beer.   Got the Channa Masala and Butter Chicken (on a side note I am not Indian but would certainly challenge any restaurant with my own India Fare, I make it hot) it was good, chicken was boneless and without any fat.  My friends' dishes also appeared to look pretty good. Food is fresh and there is a lot of if for the price. I played it safe with the standard Indian plates but there were many options. Beer is in bottle no tap but good selection of Asian and N. American. Full fare was 40 bucks with taxes and booze.  Good Show."}
{"text":"Came here with work colleagues to celebrate the start of summer. Copper Chimney is apparently a favorite of the locals. Service was pretty good as I found our server to be extremely attentive. One of the dishes was extremely spicy (for me) and I needed a lot of water so our server came to the rescue. CC has a lot of lunch specials and you get bang for your buck. I ordered the Chef's Special ($10), which was a generous portion. Anyway, I've had the opportunity to check out a few Indian restaurants - CC was good, but nothing out of this world hence the three star review. That being said, I would not be opposed to dine here if I was invited out.  Good for: Indian, lunch"}
{"text":"Great local spot, always busy on the weekends (and even most weeknights too.) Sunday nights are jammed with people sitting down and people taking out. The food is all pretty tasty and they're able to accommodate gluten sensitivities....all the curries are gluten free, as are most of the other dishes...everything except the Naan pretty much. Plus, for Avenue Rd, it's all priced well too."}
{"text":"Well folks rave about this place, however the service today is abysmal  On patio, after 15 mins. Had to go in and grab a menu   Placed my order and 25 mins later still waiting for my drink.  Had to ask for water a few times as  well.  The couple next to me had to ask about the status of their order as well, and since they had been sitting there for so long, I assumed they had already eaten.  I ordered the Lamb Masala, and the Pakora, with rice and naan.  Average food, with nothing to write home about.  What's with all the rave reviews about this joint?  I don't get it!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a reasonably-priced Indian food in the Avenue-Lawrence neighbourhood.  I just went there with my parents, it has a really family feel.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The owner was charming as well."}
{"text":"Really good food! I walked in for a take out order, food came out really fast and tasted awesome. I ordered butter chicken, aloo gobi, and garlic naan. The food was very flavourful and tasted authentic. I've tried dozens of indian places, this is one of the good ones. I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I went here with my family after hearing rave reviews about this place and it did not disappoint. We went during lunch on Friday so it wasn't very busy and we were promptly seated by the very attentive server. I decided to get the Chef Thali which came with raita, a samosa, basmati, chicken tikka, Kadai chicken (I think), chana masala and kheer; pretty much everything you would need from beginning to end.   The raita tasted really fresh and certainly did it's job as a way to cool and cleanse your mouth. The samosa was small but was a good start to the meal, potatoes inside were moist and flavourful and the skin had a nice crunch to them. Kheer is one of my favourite desserts and I enjoyed it, good use of cardomom but it was a little thinner then what I'm used to.  I have to single out the chicken, for both chicken dishes was very moist (it's obvious they marinate it in yogurt) and the flavours were great.   The owners were very attentive and it was obvious that they cared about the quality of the food, which may be why I noticed quite a few regulars eating there. All very reasonably priced ($10) for a meal that was definite step above the usual buffet  I usually do for lunch. I should mention they don't do lunch buffets, I'm sure it has to do with the fact that they have enough pride in the quality of their food not to pursue that option.  As someone who loves Indian food this is definitely one place I'd go out of my way to go to again."}
{"text":"Very good food, though we wanted to order more but was told kitchen closes by 9:30. To early to close by standards on an Indian restraunt"}
{"text":"Solid indian food. Definitely worth the price! lots of food. Not the best indian, but definitely worth a visit. Service could improve."}
{"text":"Food is passable nothing special. However, the service left a lot to be desired. Been there a couple of times but one incident stands out. The host refused to seat our group of 3 (although a larger table was available) and also refused to provide us with any time frame within which a table could be arranged. Will not go there again, or recommend the place. There are better places serving indian food in toronto and any service is better than copper chimney"}
{"text":"Simply put, excellent Indian food with excellent service! The wait staff are very attentive even with a full restaurant, and regularly fill your water if it's empty. The service is quick, though they tend to serve everything you've ordered all at once, so be prepared to wait if you've made a large order.  We have a habit of ordering way too much food. We got the salmon and chicken tikka, the lentils, the eggplant, the okra, the fish and prawn masala, and the chicken methi complete with garlic naan, plain naan, and rice. All of the dishes are served in deceptively small bowls that hold quite sizeable portions. The prawn masala, for example, came with around 10 prawns, which is quite generous! The chicken methi was also a highlight of the meal, with quite a unique flavour thanks to the herbs that they use.  You'll want to make a reservation at this place, as there were several parties waiting at the door throughout the evening."}
{"text":"Oh my god best Indian place ever! We had no reservations and they had no tables and guess what they were so helpful that they moved their cutlery from this back table and set it up for us!! Forget how nice they were, the food was out of this world no wonder they were rated number 1 Indian restaurant in Toronto! Please take a moment and read the articles posted between the 2 doors at the entrance!"}
{"text":"Great Indian cuisine. The food always tastes fresh and savoury. Nice presentation. Very good selection of various meats, fish, vegetables and nans, all worth trying. My family and I have enjoyed each and every visit there over the last year or so. Nice vibe too!!! Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Surprisingly solid Indian meal on Avenue Road!  All good vegetarian and seafood dishes that were not oily and overly spiced. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Inside is a little small and outdated. Some of the menu items were not available (mango chicken) because they were sold it. It was still pretty early in the night though. Will definitely go back again though,for the food alone."}
{"text":"If you want a break from generic indian restaurants, this is your place. It has different items - like Palak kofta instead of the usual malai kofta. Everything is great from appetizers to mains to breads and to dessert. Even the masala tea was to die for. We are vegetarians, but looking around everyone was enjoying their food. Truly a gem"}
{"text":"Okay, well, first off the bat, I suppose I should mention that we had a rather unpleasant experience with the delivery guy from the Copper Chimney.  After waiting almost an hour for our food, I got a call from a number I didn't recognize but figured I should probably answer just in case it involved our dinner.  It did.  It was our delivery guy complaining that he didn't want to park outside the building because he was afraid he'd get a ticket. And that's my problem how, exactly? He wanted me to come down and pick up the food, and I refused. I feel like this is a scam he pulls on every apartment he goes to because if you can avoid the hassle of actually delivering the food to the customer's door, why wouldn't you? I guess, anyway. I don't really know what he was thinking.  Anyway, I called his bluff and he delivered our food. (He kind of shoved it at me when I opened the door but whatever.)  So we ordered three things:  Vegetable Samosa (\"A flour pastry crust stuffed with spiced potatoes, onions, green peas, lentils\"): These are fine, I guess. They're well made and the ingredients seemed good, but they're awfully bland. They do come with a tangy, sweet sauce, and that certainly helped.  Lamb Vindaloo (\"A fiery spicy curry from western india, cooked with spices, fresh ginger and kashmiri red chillies\") and Beef Masala (\"Tender chunks of beef tenderloin cooked with bell peppers, onions and garlic\"): These are both decent dishes, and I especially enjoyed the Vindaloo. It was quite hot and flavorful. But the problem was virtually every bite contained something inedible, whether it was a bad piece of meat or a crunchy spice of some sort. It was actually pretty frustrating.  Between the bad service and odd assortment of inedible bits, I really can't see myself ever ordering Copper Chimney again."}
{"text":"Got here at about 7 PM on a weekday and there was a table wait shortly after we were seated.  I can understand why.  The food is terrific.  Indian restaurant standards for the most part and prices perhaps a tad cheaper at dinner than some other Indian restaurant.  What is special here is the high quality of preparation and the care in seasoning.  Dishes are very distinct in flavour and portions are large.  They do serve beef so I assume they are Muslim or Christian.  The beef madras style was great as well as the mango chicken and the chicken methi, which is a more unusual dish worth ordering for the flavour of the methi leaves.  One of our party ordered mulligatawny, here a lentil soup, which was also first rate as was the gulab with vanilla ice cream another of our party had for dessert.  If you like tandoori, they have a big variety of choices.  This end of the upper Avenue road strip does not seem to have a public  parking facility so you may have to walk from the one at the other end if street parking is taken up.  Storefront location is too small for large groups."}
{"text":"This is my third trip to copper chimney and my first review.    The restaurant is very pleasant.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff very easy to deal with.  The menu has a lot of diversity to it and spans multiple foods from different parts of India.  Tonight I had the Methi Chicken and the eggplant.  The restaurant was able to provide multiple gluten free options to me.  The eggplant was divine.  I did not expect it to be as flavourful as it was.  It was loaded with the flavour of several black cardamom pods and was cooked half mashed and part chunks.  It was really that good.  I could've eaten two orders of this dish.  The methi chicken was loaded with fenugreek.  I love having lots of fenugreek, and both dishes were topped with lots of fresh grated ginger which is another bonus as far as I am concerned.  I wanted to love this food more, but the chicken was white meat and was dried out, and a little heavy on the salt.  This is a common practice that helps to cut down on prep time, but distracts away from the quality of an otherwise exceptional meal.  I would definitely eat at this restaurant again, but I'm hoping the meat will be juicier the next time I come."}
{"text":"Saw an article on the Toronto Star ages ago, and had since forgotten how much I wanted to try The Copper Chimney. It was very busy on a Friday night, and we had made no reservations, but the hub and I were warmly greeted and did not have to wait very long. The food was excellent, we ordered 2 basmati (one wasn't enough), naan, a lamb curry, and a butter chicken. The chicken was a little dry but the flavour ... soooo good. The lamb was even better, tender and juicy, again great flavour, but a little too spicy for me (I just suck it up). Really good Indian food!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, really fresh, reasonably priced and they deliver! This place has just become my new favorite Indian eatery :)  I always order the same three things the first time I try an Indian place, to see how they match up to each other. The butter chicken was very pleasant, with tender chunks of white meat in a sauce that wasn't overly sweet. The lamb vindaloo is made with surprisingly tender pieces of meat (most places overcook their lamb), and the sauce is flavourful and oh so spicy (as advertised).  What amazed me was the saag paneer. It was a bright, fresh green :)  Not a dull waterly sludge like most places, and you could see and actually taste the spinach! The paneer was a nice texture, not rubbery at all. It was the best saag paneer I've ever tasted.  I can't speak to the issues other people had, because they're mostly service issues. The fact that they're delicious and delivery makes them tops in my books :)"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall. I never heard about it before stepping inside. The staff are really friendly and the food is delish. Everything we got was amazing and there homemade naan is unreal."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. At a glace the butter chicken looks really awesome but it's just cream and oil that sits at the surface, when they go to scoop the portion onto your rice, it's all water.  Surprised this business is still here."}
{"text":"one of the best indian restaurants u can go in this town... The butter chicken is the best in toronto... Good food, friendly staff and perfect ventilation for such a small place. I have found my indian restaurant finally...."}
{"text":"Love this place for take out or eat in. Great service and great food. So good.  Note I've only tried the vegetarian options, can't go wrong with any of them. That is all."}
{"text":"The food here is very delicious and as a vegetarian, it's great to have choices but the last 2 times we ate there, both my daughter and myself were ill. I know many people that love it, but I would not return."}
{"text":"I am very picky with indian food.  VERY!  Last night was the first time we tried this place and we did take out so we can have dinner while watching movies...and you know, sometimes with takeout, they give you a lot less because you only realize it when you get home BUT, this wasn't the case.  We ordered Butter Chicken and Lamb Roganjosh, rice and 2 orders of naan.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  Lots of places make their butter chicken with ketchup or sweet and that's not the right way to make butter chicken.  THIS place, is like my other favourite indian restaurant in Etobicoke so now I don't have to go all the way there for GREAT butter chicken.  The Lamb Roganjosh was also off the charts.  The sauces are different (Not like some places where all the dishes taste the same).  Rice - Steamed rice was not your normal plain simple dry rice..this was great!  Had some colour to it as well.  Naan was fresh and soft even after sitting out a bit.  Overall, great food!  We will definitely try dining there for the experience next time."}
{"text":"Recently ordered from this restaurant for the first time and will definitely be going back!!  The food was delicious and hot! Great classics like butter chicken and rice, and the naan bread was very good!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants ever. The chciken vindaloo was terrible but the service was worse than any place I have ever been and after repeatedly asking for the manager, he did not have the courtesy of coming out and even talking to us. U paid the full bill for a meal I did not eat. Never going back and I don't recommend anyone from eating there."}
{"text":"Food is good. But what they don't tell you is that the rice and the naan bread is extra. They don't come with the dishes. They ask you how many you want then charge you without letting you know before hand. Not cool with that."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have found in Toronto. A lot of them are good, but you pay for it the next day. They taste great cus they are filled with excessive amounts of fat and cream and ghee which tends to cover the poorer quality ingredients and mass-produced taste, but your body isn't fooled and hates you afterwards.  The true test proving the quality of the food at Copper Chimney is when we took my colleagues mom here for lunch - a native from India - and if you know any Indian mom's, you know they know food and that they can cook...and that they will be more than happy to criticize any restaurants food and convince you to just come back home to their home cooking :)  But this mama was impressed! Awed by the authenticity of many of the dishes, she liked them all and even compared a few to back home. She didn't rave about this too loudly mind you, but all the food was cleaned off her plate by the end of the meal.  The samosas are fresh, hot and crispy, and all of their curries are rich, hearty and fresh. And they will always accommodate when requested.  4 stars because the service can be a tad slow at times, hard to find parking, and the ventilation is a bit lacking.  Check it out if are craving a home-made Indian meal, without all the work!"}
{"text":"Going to The Copper Chimney was a last minute decision.  Since I have no idea what's in the neighbourhood, all the 4 star reviews on Yelp led me here. I have to say I was a little disappointed with my experience here.  The reservation was painless as I reserved through Open table. My friend decided to meet me up at The Copper Chimney since it is one of the places he want to visit.  I want something spicy and hot, so I decided on trying the Chicken Vindaloos ($11.95) and with Naan ($1.95). I requested Indian Spicy... which come out to be Indian Mild... it definitely didn't give me a heartburn nor made me drink water like there's no tomorrow!  My friend decided on the Nailli Lamb ($14.95) which I don't really care as much as I never a lamb person.  I didn't realize we ordered a large order of rice ($3.50), until it arrived on the table and it showed up on the bill.  The portion was quite small... as my friend after finished eating his lamb started digging into my chicken....and after he still hungry....   Service was a little slow but friendly, as the restaurant was packed.   Tips: look for coupons online....."}
{"text":"I have to give 5 for 5, the food was made with love. I don't think there is a higher compliment. I really liked the small but well done decor. The appetizer was the first one in menu and a super good light pastry with veggies and sauce, unforgettable! If I could just remember the name. The chx tikka masala is like the basic test, and they past it with flying indian colors. And an amazing veggie dish with veggie balls, who doesn't like veggie balls? Jummy!! Garlic nann, rice and rieta and we walked out so happy and full. This place goes into my Toronto  restaurant list of places I not only want to come back too, but want to bring friends and work clients along so they can taste the love too."}
{"text":"They don't follow their hours of operation. So I called ahead and told the guy I was coming and he STILL closed before their scheduled time. I even told the guy I JUST called and he locked the door"}
