{"text":"The restaurant was nothing wonderful.  The dining area seemed dirty.  The kitchen seemed slightly unkept and the staff unfriendly.  Unfortunately the toys are mostly dirty, broken and/or unkept.  The toys in sandbox, on our visit this past summer, were simply dangerous for kids.  Every plastic sand toy was either broken or cracked.  The women's bathroom was appalling...everything seemed dirty and/or broken.  Toilet paper roll was barely hanging on by one screw.  We had often talked of visiting ZuZu Cafe but we will not be visiting again.  Too bad because the place seemed to have promise and potential.  A little extra care and attention to detail would improve this restaurant and give it a true character."}
{"text":"I ordered the French Torte with rosewater lemonade today and loved it! The food is always good and nice area with books for children. Hard to find another cafe that compares to it in Madison. Great location."}
{"text":"The setting and layout of Cafe Zuzu couldn't be more perfect: a bright sunny space with lots of windows on a quiet corner right across from Vilas Park. The staff are friendly and helpful, the coffee's great, and there's a good selection of baked goods. But I've gotta deduct a star for the food. My experience has been limited, but the turkey panini I had today was a travesty. I wasn't even sure if there was turkey inside: I had to open it up to find one thin slice of deli turkey inside. They also make their paninis on pita bread, which sounds good in theory but doesn't work nearly as well in reality.
  To summarize: great location, great coffee, friendly staff, great for kids. But if you're hungry, scrutinize the menu carefully."}
{"text":"Peanut butter jelly time?  I think not!  Not sure why the PB&J is only appart of the lunch menu, but if you want one for your child before 11 am, dont count on it.  The two employees were unwilling to relay anything to management (which we believe was skyping on the nearby couches) that it is easier to make a PB&J rather than a smoothie.  The employees only knew to say that it was against the policy to make a PB&J before 11 am.  
Anyways, I ordered an egg sandwich with tomato and turkey and it was just an ordinary sandwich in that I could have made the same thing at home, but better because I would have had Tobasco.  I asked for Tobasco but  was offered their homemade \"chili\" sauce, which tasted like pureed sundried tomatoes with chili powder.  It wasn't bad, but I enjoy the bite of Tobasco with my eggs.  

Anywhoo, so if that was management relaxing on the couches, then shame on you for not standing up to defend your strict PB&J policy and invest in a lil Tobasco!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't very friendly. The self-serve ice cold water was nice though! I had my two-year-old with me. Judging from the overall look of the place and the crowd they must draw (visitors of the Henry Vilas Zoo from across the street) I thought they'd be child-friendly but it appears to be otherwise. 

Ice cream was ok. Outside seating was nice. However, next time, I wouldn't make it a priority to stop here after visiting the zoo but I wouldn't mind getting treats from here again if I absolutely have to."}
{"text":"Delicious paninis and fun atmosphere for lunchtime. It was a great spot to relax and talk with friends. Their drink selection was very good as well. Perfect for after the zoo."}
{"text":"In addition to being of the few places in Madison where I have found Alterra coffee, this cozy little cafe has great service and friendly staff. I walk down from the UW just to have lunch or one of their amazing black-bottom or pumpkin muffins. It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal here. Their chicken plate special is my favorite, and their lattes are always good. Their pumpkin spice latte is probably the best in town: rich, mostly unsweetened, with real pumpkin. Great little place, very kid and pet friendly. A family favorite."}
{"text":"A great place for a healthy flavorful meal, with great service and good prices, too. The Middle Eastern food is particularly good. Wonderful patio for the good weather, but we just enjoyed the sunshine in the window seats for a February lunch."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, small selection but really hit the spot. My #1 lunch spot if I am anywhere nearby"}
{"text":"Went there one afternoon and really enjoyed it. The food tasted fresh, nice mozzarella and tomato panini along with a side salad of micro-greens.  Absolutely great, I wouldn't have changed a thing... except for a bowl of tomato soup instead of the salad.

The layout was a bit wonky, seating was  getting a seat, the chairs were loose and falling apart, tables were not as clean as I would like, they seemed to trust the diners do do their own bussing but for the most part the people do."}
{"text":"I've always loved ZuZus location and their food is always stellar. It can be a bit overrun with kids but hey what do you expect when you're directly across from the zoo. The staff is always friendly and service is prompt. The spooner is hands down my favorite sandwich. Regarding a previous reviewer who objected to being called out for brown bagging it. To walk into a restaurant and order coffee and then sit and eat food you've carried in is just plain rude. If it were my establishment I probably would have asked you to leave."}
{"text":"A darn good panini. Nice neighborhood cafe...lot's of kids playing..bright colored decor.....good food. The tables rock sometimes...and the tables can be a little sticky...but....a darn good panini!"}
{"text":"I live a block away from Zuzu and love it.  I can walk over there to treat myself to lunch (usually a sandwich and salad), ice cream, or pick up some spotted cow.  The prices are about what you'd expect at a coffeeshop/cafe, which is why I don't go all that often, but when I do pop in I enjoy it.
The cafe is clean, they have the Onion and nice big windows so you can sit and watch the neighborhood while you sip your coffee."}
{"text":"I like this place -- let's say that first.   I like the food and the location.   However, I have some constructive criticism:

The service for the last 6 months or so has been VERY slow and not all that friendly.   It seems there is a high turnover of staff and the pace behind the counter could be shifted into a higher gear.   I like a chill environment, but too often the staff look like deer in the headlights.    

On a couple occasions recently the coffee was burnt.    I just ask before I get the house coffee to make sure it is fresh.  I think they are working on that.

Finally, the sinks, coffee grinder, blender (they have smoothies) are all quite dirty.   I recommend some deep cleaning now and then"}
{"text":"Eh.  I'm still lukewarm-to-cold on this place.  I like the location and sandbox.  And service has, in fairness, been consistently better than on our first really bad experience.  So that's a plus.  But I've been repeatedly underwhelmed by the food here.  Some of my neighbors adore this place though, so I keep giving it another shot...  

My most recent dining companion recommended that I order one of their entree specials last time I was (reluctantly) there, so I did.  The flavors were, admittedly, great, but the food was cold in the middle.  Like, icy cold.  I had him try it, and he acknowledged the food was quite cold.  I guess it had been frozen and microwaved?  I tried mixing it all around to distribute the heat and that kind of worked, but it just wasn't appealing.  I don't know -- either I have really bad luck, or this just isn't my scene."}
{"text":"Nice location near the zoo.  Typical cafe fair and there is nothing wrong with that.  Very clean inside, pleasant staff.  You bus your own tables.  I only had an iced chai which was perfect but my companion had a breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee and seemed to enjoy both.  I'd like to note that this place isn't much of a local market, it looked to me like they only sold milk, eggs and beer.  Technically they serve breakfast but it's only muffins and an egg bagel sandwhich, it's more of a lunch place.
Anyways I can only 4 stars for now, I'll have to get better acquainted with the menu before I can give it a full 5."}
{"text":"So close yet so far away...

From the street Zuzu Cafe look colorful, warm and inviting.  As you walk through the door you get a whole different impression.

While the interior is has the same vibrant color scheme i found myself less than impressed.  Every counter, chair and table look worn and gives the impression that maintenance is not a priority for the owners.

I inquired about gluten free menu options and was looked at like I was from another planet.  Undaunted I searched the menu for something I might be able to eat finding some breakfast burritos served on a tortilla.  I asked if they could make it with a corn tortilla instead of flour but without checking with anyone the server said sheepishly that it wasn't his call.  I considered pursuing the matter with the manager but since the employee behind the counter so uncomfortably with my request for a substitution I surmised that his experience discussing menu changes with management in the past was less than productive.

I settled for Cafe Mocha which was not bad but I can get good coffee almost anywhere in Madison.

Too bad!  This could be a great little diner with a good cleaning, some minor menu tweaks and some attitude adjustment by management."}
{"text":"Delightful location with lots of promise, but overall, this place fails to deliver.   

Located near UWMadison and the Madison Zoo, ZuZu is ideally situated.   The place has ample outdoor seating and is very kid friendly (sandbox, activities for kids, etc).  Even the menu (PBJ's) and signage (\"for everyone's Safety park your strollers outside).  

Let's start with service - this was off the moon rush and I counted 6 employees.  2 were mostly staring, one was taking orders, not sure what the other folks were doing, but service was pretty slow.  

Food - ordered the Drake (a slice turkey meat sandwich) and the Randall (roast beef).  The sauce of mayo/mustard in the Drake was so overdone it was oozing out the sides and overwhelmed the sandwich.  The Roast Beef was tasty enough but it was the kind of cured meat that happens to 'stay with you' the rest of the day.  

All in all, maybe it was just an off day for the staff -- not sure, but not a place to visit twice."}
{"text":"Home style cooking by somebody who REALLY knows how to prepare super healthy, mostly vegetarian fare.  Seriously, I don't know where I could find healthier, better prepared food in Madison. I felt like I was in a Main Street restaurant in Mill Valley CA. Try it!

Then, when the dinner hour's closing, the chef is cleaning windows, a sign of a well-maintained establishment."}
{"text":"Over priced and just average enjoy it urban hipsters."}
{"text":"This place is located very close to the Henry Vilas Zoo so is very convenient to stop in for coffee or food as you walk back to your car. They are very kid-friendly, with kid-sized tables and a kid play area, with books and toys. The general decor is a little outdated and chaotic (maybe going for 'homey?') The coffee (I ordered a hot latte and an iced latte) was ok. The food was really nothing special (we ordered BPJ, gyro sandwhich, panini - Spooner) - really kindof bland tasting and dry."}
{"text":"Really good quiche and coffee.  It's a cool place, the staff are nice and it's kid friendly.  Score."}
{"text":"I have heard of the ZuZu for about a year now, but finally made my way to it. I first heard of it when I was camping and there a fine gentleman camping next to me with a soccer team of young children. In apologies for the kids running around my campsite kicking soccer balls into my campfire, he offered me and a friend some corn chili (vegan). I accepted and it was pretty good, not amazing. I started talking to him and it turns out that he is one of the owners of the ZuZu. 

As I said before, I thought I would give it a shot. It was friday night, but it wasn't busy in there. There were a few groups in there, but there were open tables. My friend had already arrived and was eating a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin and had order a cappuccino. I order the salmon wrap with greek salad and rice. My other friends ordered some tapas (spicy pita) and wine.

The food didn't take long in coming out, although my friend's cappuccino took about 15 minutes.

The wine was pretty good, it was a merlot and I don't typically enjoy reds, but had no problem drinking this one. The salmon was very enjoyable and salad was pretty good too. The rice was not great and I only ate a couple of spoonfuls. I was full at the end of the meal, which is always a plus in my mind. 

The counter staff and \"wait\" staff (they just bring you your food, don't actually get you drinks or anything) were very courteous and friendly. 

Price was pretty good (I paid 8$) and I will probably hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Hands down best place for lunch just a wee bit away from campus! The specials are always good. The Jarre soup is amazing and everything I've had is very flavorful!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and have always had great food. We went tonight after the badger family fun day and walked in at 4:43. The kids working said they close in 15 minutes and we could not get food! Very disappointed by the rude young lady lady behind the counter! Think twice if you are heading to ZuZu's anywhere near closing time!!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting and waiting to go back to the ZuZu to try \"The Spooner\" which is a panini with pesto, mozzarella, and tomatoes.  I realize this is a super common, super simple combination, but I was blown away. It was so, so, so good.  By far one of the best of its kind.  I LOVE this restaurant. I would eat here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"I am very glad to have ZuZu within walking distance from my apartment. This place makes Vilas neighborhood much more attractive. I have always enjoyed zuzu's coffee and food. They are not spectacular, but I don't have any complaint. 

Nonetheless, if you are looking for a hipsters' cafe, then you'll be disappointed. It is really a family style cafe-restaurant than a place to bring your laptop to work. It's a great place to stop before or after your visit to the Henry Vilas Zoo. 

Interestingly, they also sell milk and cheese in their mini market in the cafe. I don't know how many customers take advantage of it, but could be pretty convenient for people who don't want to travel far for some basic grocery items."}
{"text":"We went to the zoo and it was quite a warm day so by the time we were done we were hot and hungry! We decided to check out ZuZu's and it was delish!! Everyone was happy with their choices (gyro sandwich, hummus plate and Greek salad) and we left refreshed and full! Extra bonus the England v Belgium World Cup game was on!! Definitely suggest stopping here when your in the neighborhood and I will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"Man, I really like this little spot and it took me way too long to figure out how great it is....I spent many years passing it up and finally decided to check it out last summer. Their variety of dishes they offer is incredible and I love the variety of spices they offer!  The first time I was there, I had shakshuka and it was just incredible. Today I stopped in for a coffee, plain and simple...but I just love stopping there. I had my daughter with me and the atmosphere is very kid-friendly."}
{"text":"Cannot believe this place is only rated 3 1/2 stars!  Amazing! The staff was super helpful with our crazy order for 3 kids and 3 adults. The food was healthy, quick, delicious, and priced reasonably. Great location just across the street from the zoo. There's never healthy and cheap food anywhere, especially the zoo. We were really pleased with this place."}
{"text":"Zuzu is a kinda crunchy neighborhood place next to the zoo. Relatively small, but just fine for lunch!

The good:
*Very affordable! Two large portion entrees and a big bowl of soup for around $20
*Randomly, they have a bar! And a strangely diverse selection of cocktails! And, most important, a glass of wine for VERY cheap. The bar only has two seats but I was surprised to find one in this coffee shop-style restaurant, with cheap drinks being a bonus
*Food was generally pretty good, nothing to fawn over, but large portions. My salad was very fresh and lightly dressed which is a rarity

The not so good:
*Really family friendly. As in, we were the only people there without kids, and there were kids everywhere. We had to sit in the play zone which I didn't mind, but not the spot on a Saturday for getting a quiet bite

All in all it was a convenient, cheap spot to stop for lunch before a zoo visit and I would return... I'm sure if I ever have kids it will be a go-to!"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday to meet up with a friend for a play date with my son. Street parking only, but with it being cold out, the zoo was empty so there was plenty of room to find a spot. The cafe is small and quaint, with a delicious panini called The Monroe. My husband really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich. I was really excited that there was a corner for the kids to play, which is the main reason we chose to meet up at Zuzu. I am a little concerned that the toys are not regularly sanitized, however, as the cafe is pretty filthy. None of the tables were wiped down, there was caked food on the chairs, floor, and high chair, and there were actual piles of dirt on the Lego table. This place has a lot of potential as a great place to bring kids, but I would really like to see it cleaned more thoroughly before bringing my son back."}
{"text":"Please excuse if my descriptions are too spacey or vague in this review as my pallet is currently in a state of pure euphoria and it's slowly seeping into my head. 

This is my first time here. I had a small Alterra Americano and I was not let down. I sipped my steaming beverage and did some work for a while.

Hours later, here I sit with one of the (if not the) best bowl of soup I have ever had during my short 21 years here on earth. It's the Jarre soup, a smooth tomato base with tender chicken, long grain brown rice, garbanzo beans, and a SPECTACULAR hint of mint. 
The closest thing I can compare it to is a light Thai soup/noodle dish. This is because the soup has several finely layered flavors that fire at your tongue like a semi-automatic rifle as soon as the spoon is in your mouth.

Go to Zu Zu's. Eat the jarre soup."}
{"text":"Used to do a work meeting here every month. Fair, but not friendly. Good, but not great. Everything was 'ok'."}
{"text":"After a trip to the zoo, my son and I finally checked out ZuZu Cafe. It is in a great location across from the zoo. The outdoor patio area is perfect to continue an outdoor adventure. 

There is a large selection of beverages. So, as a parent, if you have had a rough day at the zoo, help yourself to an adult beverage from the cooler. If you are tired - coffee. :) 

I had a panini, my son had the hot dog kids meal. I did not try the hot dog (it was organic), but my panini was good. It was the Spooner - pesto, mozzarella and tomato. My moz could have been a little more melted for my taste, but overall a good sandwich. 

There is a play area for kids, which I always appreciate as well. 

The location, selection, and outdoor seating alone make this a place I will return to in the near future."}
{"text":"Go here for: 
1. Courteous, patient service.
2. Kids EVERYWHERE (not a bad thing, especially if you're a college student who never sees people under the age of 18). 
3. Good reliable sandwiches and some interesting specials. 

Zuzu's finally got free wi-fi and now there is no reason NOT to go here.  They have everything one could want, from ice cream to beer and wine to outdoor seating to tons of windows to delicious lunches- it is a little out of the way, but that means that the crowd is much different than any other coffee shop downtown and not infested with hipsters and Mac computers.  I certainly don't think these are bad things, the change in atmosphere is just a nice change.  Plus, you can't get garlic aioli like this, on sandwiches or their delicious Mediterranean potatoes, anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"Oh my the gyros are to die for. The zatziki sauce is amazing and the greens. The rose water lemondae. Not a huge fan or their coffee, but it's also a great place to grab a quick 6 pack if you live in the area. Also hand dipped ice cream in the summer."}
{"text":"Went to Zuzu's on a recommendation from a friend's sister's fiance...great choice.  Had some sort of sandwich named after a road...and it was GREAT.  There was some sort of sauce involved that was just spectacular.

YUM.  Cool place, cool location, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I like the location near the zoo, the atmosphere and room is nice with an outside eating area.   I've only been here once but I was disappointed with the pita panini I ordered.   It was quite large with a large slice of turkey and some cheese in the middle.  It just wasn't that flavorful and the whole thing was less than 1 inch thick.  It was adequate but I would never order it again.  The soup was fine but also nothing to write home about.  
I will probably stop by again sometime and try something else.   The turkey panini really needs improvement.  I want it thicker with thicker pita and maybe some sprouts.  Layer the turkey and maybe do some other flavor things with it."}
{"text":"I've been here before, and ZuZu's has a few things going for it: great location across from the zoo, plenty of outdoor seating, and a sandbox for the kiddos to play in.  If it were not for those things I'm not sure that I would ever come here.  

The food/beverages are bad and overpriced.  

I had one of their specials today: Tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich. the sandwich was OK, the soup was so salty I couldn't stomach more than a few bites. The espresso I ordered with it was cold and watered down (I'm not positive that they don't re-use the grounds in the espresso machine...)  

Bottom line:  if you are visiting the zoo and want a beer/ice cream and a place to sit, ZuZu's is your place.  If you want anything more than that go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place.  For $10 I got $6 worth of food.  My pita consisted of cheese, the occasional red pepper, and one slice of lunch meat turkey, but was mostly bread.  The soup, which was the best part of the meal, tasted like it came from a can."}
{"text":"Got a roast beef panini here today after visiting the zoo, it was pretty good! counter service but they brought the food to my table. prices were fine."}
{"text":"Small cafe with a neighborhood vibe. The menu is simple with 6-7 sandwiches, a few salads, 2-3 soups, and a menu of daily specials. When I bike around Lake Wingra, ZuZu is the perfect place to take a break and fuel up. The food is here is light, affordable, and delicious. Apparently they have jazz on Thursdays so I definitely want to come back for that."}
{"text":"An ok place for a light lunch.  Probably a great place for Yuppie parents with kids, plenty of sandbox area to keep them busy.  Seems like a place you go to on a nice day to relax, enjoy a few beers and conversation.  It definitely can get to be a bit chaotic if school is out and you hit it at the right time during lunch with the zoo across the street adding to the traffic."}
{"text":"Despite my many trips to the Henry Vilas Zoo over the years I've never stopped at the ZuZu Cafe across the street. I'm glad I finally did! There's plenty of outdoor seating, a sandbox for the kiddos, and a sunny interior. The menu is simple, but everything looked fresh. We only stopped for ice cream (Sassy Cow) but the bakery case convinced me I should come back one morning to work. The black-bottom muffins looked particularly delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch near the zoo! Have been taking the kids for years, every time we visit Madison."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a snack or meal before or after a visit to the zoo. Split pea soup and hummus platter were both very tasty. Friendly staff - the owner saw that we were running low on pita bread and brought us more."}
{"text":"FYI...they no longer have toys for kids.  That was a bit of a let down. The breakfast was.....ok.  Coffee is good.  That's about all I can say of the place, other then we've been there."}
{"text":"I write a food blog and have a section on it called \"50 ways to love a chickpea.\" It should therefore go without saying that when I walked into ZuZu and saw the brunch special l started to weep uncontrollable tears of joy. The Lablabi  is a thick, tomato-y soup with TONS of chickpeas and Moroccan spices (HELLO EVERYTHING I LIKE). It normally comes with a fried egg on top (I opted out), and has great value at $3.96 per bowl. 

The menu is short but sweet. They have super tasty Mediterranean wraps (I tried the Henry... when I returned for the second day in a row...) and panini. They even have vegan brownies which are more like slices of cake and are delicious!

The outdoor seating is divine the three months of the year that it's warm here ;) There's lots of seating and it's adjacent to Vilas Park and the zoo. I wish I had found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick coffee and breakfast, but we got there a little after 11, which is when they stop serving breakfast. Sad face. Got the hummus plate instead; LOVE their hummus. Lots of bright lemon-y notes, and a giant, generous dollop of hummus. Not enough pita bread to soak it all up; that's ok, hummus is also a good salad dressing. Giardinara is a surprisingly appropriate addition to hummus. The pita wedges were piping hot and delicious with tomato and cucumber. Their hours are 7am-7pm and they sell wine. Short walk from my house, win-win."}
{"text":"Really convenient location by the zoo.  The Mediterranean dishes are delicious, especially the gyro.  And be sure to pick up a black-bottom muffin...they're amazing!  Prices are ok, and there's wi-fi.  Just be aware that if you're there to study, there is a kids area which is usually populated by several of them during the daytime."}
{"text":"I came to have one beer and got made fun of by the bro behind the counter for ordering a Schlitz... Never coming back."}
{"text":"I go to Edgewood and I love going to the zoo since it's free and a great way to get out during the day and do something more interesting than just sit outside. Every time we go we stop at ZuZu's. It's great, I love the food, I love people watching and the street is always busy on a nice day. It's pretty inexpensive, which is great, and I've never had something I didn't like. Perfect place for the Vilas area, love it. The only thing I would say is that there isn't much seating, especially outdoors, so it's hard to find a good spot, and we've ended up just eating on the curb."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today. I had a nice time there despite the umbrellas being too small to actually protect you from the hot sun...I would have gone inside if there hadn't been a zoo of children screaming and crying. After buying a coffee and iced tea (each refilled once) as well as a cookie, my girlfriend and I decided to eat the lunch we packed. Since we have had no problem doing this at other local coffee shops (barriques -both, Michaelangelos, Espresso Royal-both, Fair Trade, Starbucks, Java Den, Pete's, and Steep and Brew)--yes we drink a lot of coffee--we thought it would be fine at ZuZu's. Towards the end of our meal an employee who seemed like a manager or owner (not one of the friendly people who had previously helped us) rudely informed us that what we were doing wasn't ok. According to him it is 'common sense' that you can't eat lunch there, however given that we frequent coffee shops and have NEVER had an issue, I think it is the other way around. 

Yea the coffee was good, but you can get Alterra at Barriques. 

Sure, having wine and beer at a coffee shop is unique...unless you include the better selection of both at Barriques.

I'll admitt the cookie was good, but I've had better at Barriques

In conclusion, Go to Barriques for better food, better drinks, and better service. Barriques is located on Monroe st. across from Trader Joe's and on West Washington near the capitol...basically there is no reason to waster your time at ZuZu's."}
{"text":"I think this place has adorable outside seating, a menu of healthy dishes, and solid drink choices. An enjoyable little place and a Monroe Street Gem!"}
{"text":"A cool, hip cafe that I stopped at briefly on my way to a Sunday Funday meetup in a nearby park during my weekend visit to Madison. It has a fun vibe and vibrant color scheme, reminiscent of places like Starliner Diner in Columbus, Papermoon Diner in Baltimore and the like. I only got a mocha having already eaten breakfast, but if I were a local, I could see this being the type of place I visited regularly. Very, very large patio, by the way."}
{"text":"Had a delicious blueberry muffin and richly brewed cup of decaf coffee here. Simple surroundings. Nice tunes. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with a friend before we headed out of town!  Everyone was stoked about their meals!  I chose the hummus plate which featured a variety of veggies and pita bread with a good portion of hummus!  
It was pretty small for the 8.99 price but the taste made me forget about that awful quick! 

I also got a vegan brownie to share, and that was the highlight of the of the lunch for sure!  Absolutely Dino-mite!  I wanted another one and I was bummed I shared the whole thing. :) 

All and All a good spot and they have outdoor seating which would have been lovely if the weather was better!"}
{"text":"Located in the adorable Vilas neighborhood zuzu's is a little hippie oasis. They have fair trade coffee and some interesting pastry options. I had the gyro sandwich and was not diss appointed. They have indoor and outdoor seating which makes it ideal year round and it's right by the park. Speaking of which, plenty of residential parking nearby on a not super busy street."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday to grab a couple of Bloody Marys, they had several signs that implied that they were currently serving alcohol and a good chinch of their menu contained alcoholic beverages. But when it was our turn to order they informed us that they didn't have a bartender that day and could not serve us the drinks. Still wanting to check the place out we ordered lattes. Truly a waste of money as it was so watered down you could barely taste the coffee. The cups were filled to the brim making it basically impossible to carry them over to our table without spilling on ourselves. 

All in all the service was poor, the eating area was dirty and there were several tables that didn't get cleaned during our visit. Would not recommend and will not re-visit."}
{"text":"What a great replacement for the stop-and-go near Vilas Zoo.  

Growing up in Madison I used to always wonder why there weren't places like ZuZu's in the Vilas area.  The neighborhood is so peaceful, and it's the perfect atmosphere for a nice sit-down cafe to relax and soak in some sunshine.  ZuZu's provides all of that and more.

The place is somewhat split into two sections.  There's a children's play area that has model trains and tracks setup, along with other toys.  I could imagine this getting pretty loud if there was a lot of kids present, but such was not the case when I was there (only 1 kid present).  The rest of the cafe is filled with comfortable lazyboy chairs and booths with tables.  It was a great place to sit and have casual conversation on a Saturday morning, or read a book for a few hours.  

For a coffee shop / cafe, ZuZu's has a surprising amount of food options on the menu.  All of them seemed unique, with a Caribbean theme echoing through most of the selections.  They also have a cooler with a variety of beverage choices and some basic grocery goods if you're just stopping by to pickup milk, butter, etc.  Service was prompt and polite.  I only ordered a drink, but a girl in my party had a olive/tomato sandwich and it looked very good.

Overall, great place to go if your looking to relax, grab a bite, and enjoy a casual weekend."}
{"text":"I liked ZuZu Cafe.  The sandwiches were interesting in that they were made with two pitas.  A little skimpy on the inside but the taste was good.  The soups were very good too.  Nice location near the zoo."}

{"text":"Today is March 12th, 2015. I ordered two meals. The spanakopita was dry, over cooked and we were unable to cut it. I told the manager and she said it is supposed to be that way. We said we were unhappy with our meal. She started to walk off quickly without comment. I told her we can't eat it. I asked her to give us something else. She was rude and didn't want to do anything about making us satisfied. She brought us a skimpy gyro and dropped it on the table muttering something under her breath and she walked away quickly. I went to the counter and asked for the owners name and both workers said his name was Bobby, but they did not have his number. Again, they both were unhelpful or interested in resolving the incident. I plan on calling Better Business Bureau tomorrow. It was a horrible experience and I will never go back.  I have to rate it to continue, but it deserves no stars!!!!!"}
