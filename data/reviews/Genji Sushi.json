{"text":"Amazing sushi! Really delicious. Not filled with rice and generous amounts of fish especially in the hand roll. Clean and friendly service!"}
{"text":"This little gem is definitely worth the drive, I would love to keep it my little secret, but the food, atmosphere, & service is too good to not share!"}
{"text":"I find sushi for the most part is very similar but this place was great. Service was fantastic and presentation was amazing. Nice wee gem of a place."}
{"text":"In the wasteland that is Keele & Steeles, Genji Sushi is a welcome oasis of good quality food. It's an especially great place to get away from the York campus for lunch. Good sushi, a bit pricier than some of the cheap downtown places, but this is a much more thoughtful product. Good lunch specials and really great decor! 

The place gets crazy busy around noon so try to come a bit earlier to get a seat. It's a small place, and so they may not be able to accommodate parties of more than six at one table."}
{"text":"Very very tasty. They make their own sauces for their sushi. Nice decor and excellent and attentive service. The miso is the tastiest I have ever had, and the rolls and sashimi is of very high quality. It is slightly more expensive than most neighbourhood Japanese restaurants, but you can see and taste the difference. The sushi chefs are serious and focussed and clearly take pride in what they are creating. Small but telling detail: they chill the beer glasses."}
{"text":"Closed as of March 15, 2015 due to fire. Call to see if reopened before you go.

I'm glad to see somebody took over What was formerly Ichiban because after it changed owners the establishment went down hill. Genji is good but my only complaint is that the rolls are actually too big. I don't enjoy eating if I'm worried about choking on it. I think they should make the rolls smaller."}
{"text":"We too were sad to see Ichiban go even though the food was never amazing. But Genji changed all that. The sushi has been consistently fresh. The service is excellent, the complimentary apps are great. Some of the best fish we've had in Toronto. I just hope they maintain their great standards and seriously hope more people discover them since there is no reason you shouldn't need a reservation to dine here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Talk about customer service! They were so great with our young kids even making smaller avocado rolls. Very friendly and delicious."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews, but this place is so amazing that I felt compelled to share my experience. 

From the first moment you walk in, you can tell, this place is quality and the people care. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Prices are very reasonable, great attention to detail and presentation & most importantly the quality of the food is superb! One of the best sushi places I've been to in Toronto & believe me, I'm a very hard person to please when it comes to food quality. 

Highly, highly recommend this place! And I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and the service was amazing.
Fresh ingredients, Clean and inviting decor, fast attentive service."}
{"text":"Very small place but food is very fresh!
After i order the dinner number 14 take about 10-15 to make it. Combo dinner very small and almost nothing to eat :(
Not cheap."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I really hope they are here to stay because many people don't trek out to this area and there have been so many sushi places open and close. The sushi and Korean fishes are fantastic and short ribs are great!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner for 2: We did enjoy it but had some criticism of the sushi and sashimi. It wasn't quite as fresh as we'd hoped though good for the most part. First impressions were positive: nice layout and decor, slightly more intimate-feeling booth options, clean washrooms, and music at a reasonable volume. Menus have good variety and selection, and the tea is nice.  

We ordered some rolls (avocado, unagi - Caterpillar, and mixed fish - Atlantic), the extra small sashimi party platter that comes with miso soups and green salads (which we upgraded for $2.70 fee each to wakame salad), and a BBQ beef short ribs appetizer (kalbi). It was a very filling dinner, so we could have removed 2 rolls from the meal. The biggest minus was that not all of the sashimi was as fresh as it could have been; unexpected for a Friday night. It wasn't fully off, but there were some fish that were good, and some that were just not as great, tasted a bit older than they should be. The ribs were very nice. The fat content was juicy and appealing for an appetizer (but would be excessive with a whole bunch more if in a main course). The upgrade charge on the salads was frankly disappointing, since I look at their menu and the green salads and wakame salads are actually both priced at $4.95. It was unpleasant that we were charged more than the price of a single salad to change from one salad to another for two people, and without being informed that would be the case in advance, so I feel I do have to point that out. I would consider $2 on the bill ($1 x2) for a requested substitution of an item of equal value reasonable. Our bill had $5.40. The Caterpillar roll had tasty BBQ eel and a flavourful combination with cucumber, avocado, and tobiko and the Alaska roll was straightforward with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and avocado. The Alaska roll was a challenge to find on a menu with so many tempura- or surimi-containing rolls, but I'm glad it was there. The sashimi was cut fairly well, and the salmon and white tuna were fresh. The other fish (tuna, albacore, yellowtail) could have been fresher, but it wasn't at the point of needing to outright reject them or call the health department. The party tray of sashimi doesn't come with any radish for eating in between fish, so if that's important to you (I had my avocado rolls, so was good), I'd suspect a dinner platter of some sort might be prepared with that.

Still hunting for our ideal quick-cheap-local-yummy sushi place."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? We work nearby and this is our go-to place for sushi. We come here at least every 2 weeks. The food is amazing and fresh and the staff is great. 

I honestly think it's the best sushi in the GTA.

Sometimes the wait time for your order takes a bit long (~45 minutes) but I understand that it's because everyone else wants some amazing sushi too! I like the spicy bento lunch or one of the roll sets. My only complaint is that it's not open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure going here (been here only 4 times). First time I came here after school, being in an area full of small businesses and not much of an attraction elsewhere, genji is one that stands out for sure not only in appearances but the food is amazing. Tuna pieces are my fave. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Decor 4/5
Nice clean contemporary space. Booths large and private. Well lit. Take your parents or fussiest friends. 

Service 4/5
Fast and attentive. Asian staff. Good english. They told me kitchen closed at 945 so I was made to order all at once. Food came fast. They were not busy and trying to close but never rushed me per se. My server left 1/2 way thru my visit - her day was done. Another server (owner?) took over. Ez rock music. 

Food 3.5/5
Miso soup good. Avocado salad above average - good portion and fresh - avocado sliced in too big chunks and dressing too vinegary. 
Sashimi was fresh and sliced well - but not the highest end cuts/picks. Spicy salmon roll was average or slightly below - too much of a mushy mass. 

Overall - 4/5
This is the prototypical sushi place. Not high-end top 5 sushi but almost perfect. And great value."}
{"text":"Nice interior with great food and good service. Expect the place to get busy on the lunch rush"}
{"text":"If you live in North York closer to the west end and you're looking for a place to satisfy your sushi craving then Genji is the right place to go. It's located near Steeles and Keele area.  I usually have to lower my expectations and settle for a sushi place that is just OKAY or DECENT just to get my sushi fix closer to home. It isn't anything spectacular like some places you find downtown but for this area, it's pretty great.  After I ate at Genji I thought to myself, \"hey this place is ACTUALLY really good!\"

They offer a variety of lunch specials which looks yummy but I haven't tried yet. Prices for the specials are reasonable. 

Let's start with the appetizers,

-Gyoza dumplings , shrimp tempura is pretty good nothing special.
-White tuna tataki, this dish is very plain and simple. Not bad but I've definitely had much better elsewhere. I wouldn't order this again. 2/5
- Kaibi was good. Good to share as well.  4/5

Here are some of the Chef's Rolls I had:

Fantastic Roll 5/5
- This one is my favourite, if you love spicy tuna, avocado, tempura bits and green onions this is the roll for you. It was really delicious and melted in my mouth, all the flavours blended well together.

Hawaiian Roll 5/5
- I really like this one too it's salmon tempura, avocado, cucumber, tobiko topped with spicy tuna & crunch bits

Philadelphia Roll 3/5
I'm not a fan of cream cheese but my friend loved which is smoked salmon, avocado, cream cheese & tobiko. 

Tiger Roll 4/5
- I was reluctant to try a roll with fried scallop, crabmeat, avocado, tobiko,
spicy sauce topped with salmon BUT it was pretty tasty and I liked the scallop flavour. Very different.

The d√©cor didn't look tacky, it was actually pretty nice and the restaurant looked clean. Service was very good; everyone was super nice and friendly.

Overall I give Genji a 4/5 rating. They have the typical bento boxes but at the same time they also offer a long list of creative yummy specialty rolls. If you live or work in the area and you need to satisfy that sushi craving I definitely recommend Genji."}
{"text":"Catch them if they are open. Genji often closes early if there are no costumers. Call ahead to be sure. 

Excellent maki rolls here, creative combinations, freshly prepared and tightly rolled. Go Train, Valentine and Ninja makes for the perfect trio. Miso is hit or miss and the salmon sashimi is probably prepared from frozen, so there are more reliable establishments that supply these delights, however. 4 stars for great maki!"}
{"text":"Great spot for pretty authentic sushi. I work in the area and there's not a whole lot to choose from food-wise. This is now a go-to lunch spot for both business and personal. Great decor, solid service and superb quality sushi. Who knew this area had such a Japanese gem?!"}
{"text":"As far as sushi restaurants go that aren't AYCE and $100/meal, this place tops it. The place isn't too big and gets quite busy during lunch hours so go in the late afternoon (lunch menu ends at 4pm by the way). When I come here, the waitress' are always polite and the service is great. The food quality is also decent.

I suggest you try the Fantastic Roll - my favorite of all time. It comes at a higher price tag though, $12.95 for 8 pieces but this is the roll of all rolls if you're into spicy salmon. You should also try the Spicy Maki Bento during lunch hours: 6 spicy salmon + 6 spicy tuna + salad + miso soup + an orange. I wouldn't go for the chicken teriyaki items as it is just 'OK'."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with two friends; one vegan and one vegetarian.  They were both pleased with the menu.  The staff here are really friendly and I love the ambience.  The maki vegetarian dinner was delicious and I really enjoyed it.  Would most definitely return."}
{"text":"Service and food is great. I'm glad someone referred it to me. It's like a little gem in the city."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!!  I went in at noon to sit and eat by myself and the lady at the front told me that there was no room for 1 when clearly every table in there was empty!!  They just did not want me to occupy a table where they can serve 4 people instead because the rush was starting to poor in.  I dont care how good your food is!  If you are not in the business of serving people then simply do not be in business.   Genji Sushi are greedy for money and I would not step foot in there ever again!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. The waitress was very friendly and the place was extremely clean and tidy. The fish was also relatively fresh. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day for lunch with a few people. I'm not a sushi fan so do not ask me about any of that. My buddy recommended the spicy bulgogi lunch special and I trust his food recommendations so I went with that. 

They start you off with a miso soup which was fine, but not especially flavourful (maybe it's supposed to be bland?). The lunch specials are served in bento boxes and your meat selection is served with sticky rice, cold noodles, a very small salad, and a slice of orange. It wasn't a lot of food so if you're particularly hungry or have a large appetite, you might want to consider ordering some appetizers or sides. I could have used more of the bulgogi because the amount of protein seemed a little stingy. Perhaps the dinner portion is larger.

The bulgogi tasted pretty good, but it definitely wasn't what I would consider spicy. It was more mildly spiced, but not everyone likes spice so your mileage may vary. The rice, cold noodles, and salad were serviceable but forgettable. 

The restaurant is pretty petite, but service was quick and friendly and we were out in under an hour so that was great. I would come back when I'm in the mood for a relatively light lunch."}
{"text":"Nice little gem of a restaurant in the neighborhood. Great food and good service at a reasonable cost.

It's small so come early or order ahead :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and there were a few tables taken, but the place wasn't full. This is a casual sushi place but really cute as well!

The service is friendly but a bit slow. We were greeted with a hello as soon as we walked in and were seated in a booth. We ordered the avocado salad to start and it was enough to share with two people, but not huge. 

We also shared a green dragon, dynamite and spicy spider roll. It was all super delicious and fresh! The rolls are a little on the small side however so I didn't think it was the best value for your $$"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot in a restaurant desert. Fish is very good and the tempura is excellent. Can get very busy, so arrive early or reserve!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Toronto. My go-to is the fantastic roll, which is spicy salmon topped with avocado, chives, and panko crumbs. The kamikaze roll is another good one. All the ingredients taste super fresh and service is great. I just wish they would open another location that is more easily accessible."}
{"text":"Really fresh fish. The place is very small and if you go during busy times you may wind up waiting quite a while. The sushi/sashimi platter for 2 with another roll and soup/salad for everyone was plenty to eat for 3 on a business lunch.  $66 before tip was a fair price for the amount we ate. Going to make this a regular stop when in this part of Ontario."}
{"text":"First time eating here with my co-workers.  Quality of food is excellent!  Sitting is limited.  We waited a bit but its worth it."}
{"text":"Genji has just reopened after a long renovation. Many residents of Balmy Beach are glad to see it reopened!!"}
{"text":"At first we were disappointed to see our \"old faithful\" sushi place had changed ownership but once we tried it, were hooked. The nigiri is expertly cut and draped over small balls of rice...so this nigiri is about the fish, as it should be, not the rice. The maki are substantial and stuffed with their fillings with just a thin wrapping of rice, allowing the diner to enjoy the filling and not just be filled up on rice. In fact, I've always seen California rolls as \"cheap filler\" to a set dinner, but these are, by far, the BEST California rolls I've ever tasted. 

My 16 year old foodie said the seafood udon was loaded with tasty seafood, lobster and enoki mushrooms. 

For non-fish lovers, the yam tempura maki and cucumber maki were also delicious.  

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a take out review** We were looking for some late night sushi to go. Yelp to the rescue. Genji was rated #2 in our area and it was absolutely delicious!

We ordered the small sushi and sashimi party tray and called for take out. We were told it would take roughly 30 mins. It took around 20- so that's a bonus when you're hungry for sushi! When we arrived, early, they nicely served us complementary tea.

The tray was just enough for two people. It came with plenty of wasabi, ginger and soy sauce (yes!). The sushi and sashimi was delicious- we substituted the salmon roll for more California roll (no extra charge- yay!). The soup was tasty, but the salad was nothing special. I'd come back and try their lunch specials one day."}
{"text":"Some time during the second semester of 2014, Genji Sushi took over for Ichiban Sushi. Same location, different staff, different chefs, different layout in the restaurant and above all; different menu. 

I used to enjoy Ichiban Sushi for its simple approach to Japanese food and also because of the owners, who were extremely kind & attentive. It was with sadness that I learned Ichiban was closing and it was being taken over by Genshi. Anyway, I gave the new restaurant a try, met the new owners, and after several visits, I can honestly say that the place is a vast improvement over Ichiban. Many of the traditional dishes remain, but they are now presented with a little bit more flair and class. The small changes to the restaurant layout & the changes to the menu, had a positive impact and overall this is now one of the best (if not the best) Japanese restaurant you can find in The Beach neighbourhood. For the price range, I have no doubt that it's the best one. 

So next time you're in the neighbourhood and craving some Japanese food, go give this place a try. The cozy atmosphere of the place, extremely attentive and kind staff, good menu and price are sure to please everyone."}
{"text":"I came to this beautifully decorated, elegant restaurant for a quick treat one evening as it is close to York University, where I am a student. I was delighted by what I found. I ordered the yam tempura rolls which were crispy and delicious. Although the location is a bit on the pricey side and the order took more time to fulfill than I'd expected (I was among maybe three patrons there at the time), I had a fine experience overall and hope to come again soon!"}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area and have begun to explore the restaurants on Queen Street, pretty sure we'll be back for more sushi here! Everything was super fresh, food was gorgeously presented, and overall great service! Plus, it was open on Sunday, unlike a lot of the other local restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch time. 

This place is VERY busy. We were fortunate enough to only wait 20 mins to get seats. 
The food is fresh and really good. It has a authentic Japanese taste. The restaurant is small but has a nice atmosphere. If I work in the area I would definately be back here again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi restaurants in the area. The restaurant is a bit on the smaller side, but very nicely decorated. The sushi is very tasty and fresh. The service is quite fast, and the servers are very welcoming and friendly. The prices however, are slightly on the pricier side, but with the great food, service, and ambience, I found it worth it. Overall, very impressed and satisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4

Came here for lunch with 16 people. The decor is average, but tidy and the cups are pretty cute. The lights are also very classy.

The service was mediocre, she took out orders accurately and was able to split bills quickly. Though there was not many people at the restaurant, and the service was still slow. They should have more than 1 person waiting people. She did give us a lot of spicy mayo though, which is nice when we asked. 

Got a dragon roll and a sushi and sashimi lunch box. The dragon roll was an average size, I've seen bigger (Mi Ne). The taste was decent, and the rice was good. Actually the rice was better than the fish at times too, which is both a good and bad thing. The nigiri was small though and had too much wasabi. Small piece of fish with a small ball of rice. 

Overall an average place, with decent sushi. There's honestly worse sushi places out there. Not a bad place to drop by when you're close by!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fantastic including the rolls we ordered. Miso soup was very average. Very nice ambiance. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Was going to try the new ramen place but my kids are allergic to peanuts and their hot sauce in the kitchen had peanuts and possible cross contamination made us leave and try Genji

No peanuts,  no tofu...makes it allergy safe for my kids.

The tempura was tasty and lightly battered. The salad was fresh. The sushi and sashimi was fresh and plentiful. My daughter's only complaint was the ramen noodles/souo were not as tasty.

Overall a good experience and would go back."}
{"text":"Expensive but amazing rolls!!!!
So worth it. The service is great and the food is delicious!

-Decor is outstanding 
-Wouldn't expect such a beautiful place when looking on the outside 
-Service was awesome
-Love the secluded sitting area"}
{"text":"The food is good but not worth it as the culture of the managing staff is not generous.

Staff is unpleasant service is slow and they never offer compliments for waiting customers

Too be because the food is actually good"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi.  Friendly staff.  Nice atmosphere.  Roles were on the small size."}
{"text":"Having dinner with a friend and her mom after work. Got some sushi/sashimi/maki combo and a dish of beef bulgogi. We thought it wasn't enough for 3 people so we ordered a special dragon roll. Realized her mom didn't have a big appetite for sushi, so we both ate most of the food. The food was pretty good, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place for this area. Everything is fresh. They have a number of different rolls to choose from. Sashimi is amazing. We come here all the time and we are never disappointed. Service is very attentive. My favourite sushi restaurant in the GTA"}
{"text":"Looking from the outside you would not think much about this place, it is an industrial area with lots of little storefront businesses.
I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw a little cozy Japanese restaurant with booths and small tables as if taken from Japan. 
The menu looked good and we ordered lunch boxes which were ok. Nothing great really. It wasn't bad but I wish it was as authentic and great as the decor.
I would go there again just to enjoy the Japanese style dining area but not so much for the food."}
{"text":"It's an ok sushi place - not the best, not the worst. 

Given the scarcity of decent sushi joints in the area, this one is closer to the top - may repeat if the need arises."}
{"text":"Went here before a chocolate truffle making yelp event in vaughan. Had a long hard day at work today so I really needed a great meal. J.W came about 35 mins after me so the pretty Korean servers were probably feeling sorry for me lol

I ordered a small hot sake and the server was like just... for... you? Lol I waited for J.W. to come before taking my first sip. Love hot sake with my sushi. 

Ordered the valentine roll because I wanted some crisp and lots of fish! It's the dynamite roll with spicy tuna  covered with tuna and salmon sashimi. It was large and full of fresh flavor. The price was fair for the quality. The best part was that the shrimp tempura in the dynamite roll remained crispy throughout the whole roll. The fish to rice ratio was awesome!

Had a spicy gyoza off my J.W's plate and it was the right amount of sweet and spicy. Can't rmm the roll he got but it was okay. 

The service was good, the atmosphere intimate with nice instrumental music playing in the back ground. 

All in all I would go back and try their Dragon Legend Roll and different types of appetizers. 

Tips! They have quinoa and brown rice for a dollar or two extra!"}
{"text":"Went here at around 5pm in a Thursday and I was the only customer in the restaurant though I knew Genji was great having eaten there  before, so don't be alarmed if the place isn't busy! 

Taste: The fish is so incredibly fresh and not fishy at all. I had the Sushi Maki A combo and chose the Dynamite Roll for my maki - DELICIOUS. The shrimp tempura was still warm from being made fresh and the avocado was so creamy and full of flavour it baffled me. The sauces - although they are decorative they are DELICIOUS. One was a soy sauce reduction, another was a wasabi mayo, mustard mayo, spicy mayo, and a chipotle-y mayo which were all great and made my solo meal super enjoyable and fun :).

Appearance: You can absolutely tell that the dishes are made with care, they decorate everything like an art piece regardless of how busy it is. Today was a first I've gotten an edible flower there though, so that was new and exciting! 

Service: There was a female server who has been there for quite a while who was my main server and she was delightful as always. Very sweet, accommodating and so happy that it's infectious! I dropped my chopsticks once and they were replaced in about 4 seconds. Tea refills were also prompt and I didn't even have to ask, which is always nice. 

I am moving away from the Beach soon but I'll definitely come back for some more sushi here. Don't know why I didn't come by more often while I had the chance!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.

It's a tiny restaurant with not much of a street-front presence, so I found the restaurant through Yelp and the recommendation of a friend. The interior has a nice ambience and almost makes you forget that you're in the middle of nowhere at Keele and Steeles. They also pack quite a few booths and tables into the restaurant while still maintaining spaciousness and privacy.

A friend and I ordered four rolls - the Spider Roll, Philadelphia Roll (my favourite), Dragon Roll, and Rainbow Roll. These were great - absolutely no complaints with the food. They were, however, a little on the pricy side, especially when factoring in location.

The service was notably accommodating too, considering we came very close to their closing time at 10:30. 

Overall, my first experience at Genji was solid. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late dinner last night and had an incredible meal! The renos look great - very cozy inside. Food was incredibly tasty and fresh. The presentation of everything was beautiful. Service was top notch. Would highly recommend Genji to fellow sushi/Japanese cuisine lovers."}
{"text":"We love Genji!!! Although we don't get to go often, every time the food and, very important, service are amazing!! The sushi is displayed so beautifully. They are extremely family friendly...providing our little toddler with monkey chopsticks and a cat spoon! He loved it.  The service was over the top!"}
{"text":"Went this week for the 1st time, legit rolls with really nice service, will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall, in an area that's essentially a food desert, this place is easy to miss. Inside, there's a cozy ambience with booths that offer good privacy, and clean bathrooms. Service was excellent, our waitress was polite and prompt. 

Regarding the food, I have absolutely no complaints. As usual, I got my standard order of tempura and red dragon roll as a meter stick for any new sushi restaurant, and this place was appreciably above average. The tempura was battered nicely and quite light - there's nothing worse than broccoli caked with oily half cooked batter. The roll was excellent as well, with an excellent filling to rice ratio, packed full of avocado and tempura shrimp that was still crunchy. 

The one deterring factor is the price - the total for these two items ran me at about $30 including tip, which is a little meh in my opinion. Almost took this place to 3 stars for me, but not quite. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm sad this place is so far from home - the food is delicious and the service is great.

Had a large group (13) and they reserved a big table by the window - sort of our private area.

I ordered the spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls and they were yummy- fresh and a bit spicy.  It's hard to find ones that are actually spicy.  

While it isn't a big place, the menu has lots of options- my friends got the small sushi boat and there were plenty of variety for 2 people.  The prices are good - you are definitely getting your money's worth here!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. But hospitality leaves a lot to be desired. Still, with the lack of good choices in the area it's worth putting up with feeling like your presence is a pain."}
{"text":"So fresh and good presentation.
First time I came here for my lunch takeout.
I had bulgigi and sashimi. Delicious ~
This time I came to pick up sashimi dinner. What a beautiful presentation and great cut and I enjoyed every bite. So glad that I came and this place will be my regular spot for sure. I hope they give me more wasabi and ginger. Still no big deal. I love it"}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and the taste was amazing. We got a crab meat salad which we loved it was perfectly cut and so fresh.loved the place will go back."}
{"text":"The sushi & sashimi were perfectly prepared, fresh, and beautifully presented on the plate. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, and the kitchen was accommodating of allergies (gluten). Best sushi in the area by far!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Food was fantastic. Service was exceptional. Highly recommend spicy tuna salad and wasabi roll."}
{"text":"I was in Japan for 3 months and even had sushi at tsukiji fish market in Tokyo (which was truly life changing). Still, i believe genji in the beach stacks up! I wish you well!"}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant is good sushi place.
There is nothing else in the area if you like sushi.
Always fresh, clean and pleasant atmosphere.
The only thing during the lunch time it takes 30 min to get order. They don't take preorder over the phone, so if you really busy that's not right place."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves high quality food. Fresh sashimi, delicious maki rolls and one of the best dolsot bimbimbap. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone! The only reason why I'm giving four stars is because it is a bit pricy and they tend to give you less if you order takeout."}
{"text":"I struggled to find something wrong with this place, but I couldn't. I came here for a late dinner with a friend and we both had a great experience from beginning to end. My fat a$$ struggled with the fact that there is no AYCE, and it IS on the expensive end, but you truly get what you pay for with Genji!

I ordered the Spicy Spider and Fantastic Rolls which were... fantastic. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner special. Service was beautifully polite and non-intrusive. For $55 after tax and tip for both of us, we were satiated and our taste buds were elated. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I brought my fianc√© here on Saturday night for his birthday, and it was absolutely amazing! 

At first, our service was really slow. Our waitress was tending to other tables as they were getting ready to leave, so she was putting their leftovers in takeout boxes and cashing them out. After they left, she came to take out order.

My fianc√© and I usually only go to AYCE sushi, however for this special occasion and the fact that I dressed up, we decided to eat a la carte. The quality and freshness of sushi definitely made up for the slow service in the beginning. The fish quite literally melted in your mouth, and every bite was just as delicious as the first one. 

We started off with tea and miso soup, then we ordered 2 spicy salmon hand rolls, sakura rolls, volcano rolls, and tamago sashimi (I may be forgetting 1 more roll). We came here for sushi, but being half Korean myself, I would love to come back and try their Korean dishes based on the positive experience we had from the sushi. 

We made a reservation about 2 hrs beforehand, and we were seated in a little booth tucked in the corner. The decor was very cute and Asian-like, the environment was very pleasant, and overall I got a great vibe from this place.

10/10 I would definitely recommend, especially for a special occasion or a date night. You won't be disappointed!"}

Food is always great. Sushi is always fresh. 
A must if you work or live in the area. 

Small place so either book and or show up early for lunch"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and sashimi. Tempura batter is the tastiest one I have ever had! Servers were quick and polite. My partner and I enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"The place was busy when we arrived shortly after 1 pm on a wed.  Small place but we were seated promptly and the waitress was considerate giving us seating along the wall as we had our 1 yr old with us.  Everything we tried was great, crispy salmon came hot and crispy, spicy spider roll did not have the usual avocado which my husband prefers because he is allergic.  The sushimi bowl he ordered was fresh and well portioned and the chicken udon noodles was delish.  Not overly soft still had a little chew and the broth was great.  Not those \"soya sauce\" based broth other places serve.  Unfortunately my baby choked by having too much in the mouth and ended up vomiting at the table.  The staff was quick to hand out a roll of paper towel and plastic bags and took the chair away to clean.  Felt so bad and embarrassed it happened but then again you just can't predict things like this.  Happy that they minimized the shame I was feeling by being helpful."}
{"text":"This small gem at the corner of Keele and Steeles is a neat place to go grab sushi with friends. Price-wise, my friend said this place was more expensive than sushi restaurants around the UofT neighbourhood or Chinatown but it is still reasonable for student budget imo. 

I really like their makis. Last time I tried their Valentine roll and it was tasty and it filled me up. The place was not too busy so it was a nice dining experience for us with servers' full attention on us, but I left wondering why was this place not as popular as I expected it would be?"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  It's a very small place, the decor is welcoming and the staff very attentive. The fish is fresh, although it's a little expensive. Overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh sushi everytime! 
I've been here two times, I had the chirashi and one of the sushi sets. Will reiterate everyone else: the presentation is really beautiful. I haven't seen a sushi place like this, decorating the plate like a work of art! All the fish was fresh, the rice was soft and had the right amount of rice vinegar - I can't find anything wrong. The prices are fair for such great quality sushi and believe me, this beats AYCE any day. Service was wonderful, the waitresses are really nice and attentive. Great experience here, will come back of course!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better sushi places in the East end, and is clearly aiming for higher standards; it's the only one I've gone to repeatedly. So I really wish I could give it a stronger endorsement. The chef is aesthetically inclined, and the fish is always beautifully arranged, with flavorful little extras on top, but the fish itself is just good, not outstanding. I would prefer to have that base done perfectly first, before adding any extras. The prices are not unreasonable, and the service is extremely attentive and friendly, almost too much so. The amuse-bouche sample before the meal is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I would say the quality of food at Genji Sushi is alright for the price they charge. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. I was there at around 1pm and the place was packed with what seemed like people who work nearby. The food was alright, like at any mid-range Japanese restaurant in the $10-$15 price range. Would I come back here? Yes, if I'm in the area and happen to be craving Japanese food. Otherwise, I might go to Suliko for some Georgian food (2 min drive east on Steeles)."}
{"text":"This is a half decent restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Right off the bat, you will be impressed by how clean and well decorated it is. Complete with washitsu-style seating along the perimeter, it makes for an interesting and relaxing dining experience. The service is quick. We must have been in and out in 30 minutes or less. 

The Lunch Menu is served from 11:30-4:00. It is a mix of Bulgogi, Teriyaki style dishes and sushi combos. I couldn't quite find a combo that spoke to me. I picked the Salmon Sushi + Sashimi + Maki combo. 17 pieces altogether for $13.95. I think I will have to layoff the salmon for a while! Otherwise, the bento style presentation was neat. The fish was cut thick and looked quite fresh. I thought it was missing the ornamental stuff that makes sushi look nice and taste good. Some might prefer the focus shifted to fish. 

I will recommend this place to any poor soul who works in the area or goes to York, as it is by far the best sushi option in the area."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good too. When we arrived the chef was out grocery shopping so we had to wait 20 minutes till they came back which we didn't mind. The sushi is fresh and the tempura is perfectly battered. The prices are a little bit more pricey than average sushi places but that's just a minor set back. I will definitely be back here to fulfill any future sushi cravings while I'm studying at York."}
{"text":"Genji Sushi is one of the better Japanese/Korean restaurant in the area. Great to come here for lunch if you are in the neighbourhood. Especially they serves lunch till 4 pm, with 32 different items to choose from $7.95.

We decided to get these to share, all nicely presented in a bento box with salad and our orange dessert...

Spicy Bulgogi ($8.95) 
- with 8 piece of spicy rolls
- my DC commented that the bulgogi is a little spicy, but of course I found them to be A-OK

Lunch Combo Special B ($15.95)
- the fish selections are just little boring: Salmon and Tuna
- Good big portion but the price to match too
- Shari rice is nicely prepared

Waitresses here are nice and smiley, services are good and efficient.

Genji Sushi is a decent place to meet up your friends for lunch and chit chat a little if you are in the neighbourhood.. but doesn't really worth a special trip."}
{"text":"When here on a whim as we were in the area and hungry. The food was really good and nicely presented, the decor was really pretty and the bathrooms were clean. We tried a couple of different things and we're not disappointed. I'm not in this area often but if I am I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, friendly servers, and awesome atmosphere. They don't serve all you can eat but the quality of the fish makes it well worth it. They also don't cheap out on the fish. Every role is jammed packed with fishy goodness. This place is definitely one of the best sushi joints in the city!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It's a small little restaurant tucked into this nondescript brick building, but the interior is very nice. The employees were Korean, so am I safe to assume this place is Korean owned? 

The names of some of their dishes are very straightforward, as in they're literally what they give you. I ordered this salmon box while my friend got the chicken teriyaki one. It came in a cute little bento box with six salmon maki (was supposed to have avocado, but I asked for that to be removed), six salmon sushi, and a few cuts of salmon sashimi. There was also a bowl of miso soup, green salad, and sliced orange provided. The salmon did not taste or smell fishy at all, which is an obvious good sign as it indicated how fresh the fish was. 

I didn't try my friend's food, but she got chicken teriyaki, rice, and sashimi in her box (+ miso soup, salad, and orange). She told me that the chicken teriyaki was larger and more flavourful than she expected, which is always a good thing to hear! 

Service was standard. Both our bills came up to a little under 20 dollars each. If you're a student on a budget (like I'm supposed to be...), then maybe you should save this place for a special day. Otherwise, Genji is great, and would be a very cute date idea! 

*Note: I was not on a date, but this little restaurant had some vibes going f"}
{"text":"Not going to lie it's actually pretty basic, but there's also nothing really wrong here. This is a good place to go if you're craving basic 'sushi' or some other coinciding dish and don't care for any other aspect of the food. I'm not going to go here again as it is nothing special."}
