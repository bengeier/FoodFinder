{"text":"This was the worst sushi I ever had in life. I am disappointed that they called that thing \"Sushi\".

???? 
?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Went here and ordered Hibachi Steak and Shrimp. Took forever to bring out, then they brought white rice which I didn't order instead of fried rice and didn't bring noodles with my meal. I asked for shrimp sauce and ginger and they didn't bring it or come by for another 10 minutes after our food was completely cold. Not impressed, but once they realized they messed up, they were overly apologetic, however I wasn't going to make my wife and son wait 30 minutes for another meal. That was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Just had my second visit. The first was outstanding and tonight was less than stellar. The food tasted fine. The problem was the hibachi chef. There were two working the dining room tonight. One was great and put on the show expected at a hibachi restaurant- the second could have cared less and that is who we got. We were there to celebrate and instead of a hibachi show- I heard about all the personal problems of the chef from the end of his relationship to the loss of his car. I came here to forget about my problems and have a fun time, and we left disappointed."}
{"text":"good food at decent price for lunch combos!!!  love their sushi rolls and this one waitress, she is sooo funny... she always go 'hey girl', 'what would you like to have today, girl'."}
{"text":"I frequent Tsuki because it's convenient to my office.  The food is good but the service is TERRIBLE.  I don't dine in because the service is so bad.  Order online and it takes an average of 40 minutes to have chicken fried rice prepared.  They are not apologetic for how bad the service is, and are quick to tell people to go away if the restaurant is close to full.  I try to avoid Tsuki when I'm in a hurry for lunch because of the terrible service.  I can't begin to imagine how long I would have to wait for something other than rice....."}
{"text":"I've given this place several tries since they opened, and it looks like they invested a lot into renovating the new place.  They made some adjustments the first couple weeks, and now they are a great option I would recommend.

Pros:
Nice construction, decor and GREAT music.
Friendly sushi chef and manager
Sushi had very elaborate plate presentation

Cons:
Prices a bit high, but the quality is there to back it up.  (except a couple items)
Service is a little scarce once you get your food, but it seems like they're working on improving that.
Purchased the 10-piece sashimi, but only got 9 pieces. 

Conclusion:
Tsuki looks nice and has potential. I highly encourage others to try it out."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Charlotte. Try the Yellow Tail jalape√±o... the best dish ever. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food and service both times we've eaten there. Even food did take out hibachi and it was fabulous as well."}
{"text":"Great little find in the Ballantyne area. Excellent alternative if you're tired of Nakato but would like to enjoy some fresh hibachi. The portions are generous and the staff is great, I've never had a bad experience in the 2 years I've been going here."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty. Great lunch deals.  The greatest flavor around for dinner Hibachi.   And I'm an Asian fanatic.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Ok so our first time here. We walked in and the place was empty. Hmmm... Well we decided to try it. The sushi had way to much rice in it to the point that either the roll fell apart or it was to big to get in your mouth. To me that's not enjoyable. The waiter only appeared when it was time to take money, the other waiter was the one who got us more drinks. I would say that probably not going back."}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch today since I was craving suchi rolls and they got decent reviews here.....

Located in a nice shopping center, this place did not disappoint.  The decor inside is nice and simple, which is just fine.  I came in and ordered some takeout to bring home and share with my wife.  I ordered 3 rolls, a Philadelphia roll, a California roll and a Spicy Tuna roll.  All 3 were delicious and my total bill was $12.25.  The gentleman at the front was very pleasant and my food was ready in less than 10 minutes.

I will definitely come back and try their hibachi, and will most likely frequent this place more often for lunch."}
{"text":"Tsuki Awesome sushi

I went there on Saturday for lunch. The decor is fresh and inviting. Very modern. Also family owned and operated.  Our waitress was great. we started off with there pork dumplings which are made in house. You can taste the freshness in every bite. They were also seared perfectly. I had the sushi chef just make up what he wanted for me. So I told him I wanted white tuna. He made one of the best rolls I ever had. white tuna avocado, with crunchy white tuna finished with eel sauce. can't wait to go back and try there hibachi. My wife got a salmon roll and an eel roll with avocado. The fish is very fresh. Its about time we have a sushi bar that is different and affordable.

Service was great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the best service in the area. Michelle really gets to know her customers and does an amazing job. I bring my coworkers and wife here all the time. Best food in the area!"}
{"text":"Love having this location so close to my work. They have great hibachi if you're in the mood for a show, but you can also order from a regular menu anytime. Great lunch specials and they accept the Ballantyne Discount Card. Prices are very reasonable for lunch (shrimp hibachi for $8.95!)."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience.  Sushi just the right temperature, presentation awesome.  Prompt, polite service.  2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"It's been years since in last wrote a review about a place, something has to be very wrong with the food for me to spend the time writing about it. Here it is. 

I ordered a sashimi on rice for lunch.

- Salad was OK, it's soaked in ginger dressing, it's like a ginger dressing soup.

- the sashimi rice bowl came in on a flat plate, get it? 

- It says \"10 pieces of sashimi on rice\" on the menu. I got 8 pieces of small and thin fish with 2 piece is fake crab meat. Fake crab meat is not sashimi, get it right!

- Ginger tastes rotten, it tastes like medicine.

- Fish are THIN, and NOT fresh! It's very very fishy! I could not swallow the salmon the fish tasted like it stayed in the fridge for weeks!

- Rice has too much vinegar, it was too sour.

- There are loads of cilantro in it, it must be a Chinese or Vietnamese chef that prepared it. Sashimi does not require cilantro to accompany with!

I have had sashimi all my life around the world and I read about food preparation and cooking all the time. Cannot believe I spent $15 (with tip) on a plate of disappointment.

I'm never returning here again, period."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for their hibachi lunch. First time was about a month ago and service was sloooooow.  Went again today and it was even worse.  We (me and 2 coworkers) were sat about 15 til 1. Gave our drink and hibachi orders. Received our salads timely. Then, we waited and waited for the chef to arrive.  20 minutes after we ordered, a woman and daughter came in and server put them at our table.  Normally, this would be fine, but we didn't want time to be any more of an issue knowing we would have to wait for them to go through the whole ordering/drinks/salads...plus the chef still hadn't arrived. We ended up leaving. I'll never come back to Tsuki."}
{"text":"Great group meal and sushi battle! Sushi was beautiful and well prepared. The scallop sashimi with lemon slices was amazing!

The hibachi chef was a lot of fun and talked to us about the grill and hood and how a restaurant sets them up.

A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"First timer this evening - had the hibachi grill side. Overall, had a good experience and the kids got a nice show. What we were impressed with the most is the fact that it didn't smell like a hibachi Japanese steakhouse when you walk in the front door. Unlike the other \"larger\" Japanese grill places, we didn't \"stink\" of food when we left. Not sure if it's because the lack of volume of people or if the ventilation system is good; probably a mix of both. The food quality was good and our table chef didn't over cook the items. The shrimp sauce was good and not as thick as other places. We had a good first time experience and will probably go again when we need a hibachi food fix."}
{"text":"I took my wife and two little boys to Tsuki last night to give it a try (and to avoid the traffic getting to our usual hibachi favorite). I doubt we'll be back. 

First the good: as others have noted, it is clean and modern inside, giving the place a nice atmosphere. The portions are generous, and the staff was friendly and service was prompt.

Now for the problems. We sit down at the hibachi area. The chairs are about 3 inches too low for the table so you feel like you are reaching up the entire time. We had to get a booster for my youngest (who never otherwise needs one). Then they start cranking out pulsing techno full blast; this is at 5:30pm on a weeknight. Soup and salad is served. The salad was decent, the \"miso soup\" was basically broth with what looked and tasted like a few crumbles of French's fried onions in it. Not good. The hibachi chef arrives and greets us and confirms our orders. I notice he seems to be slurring a little bit. My suspicions are confirmed when he misses many of his tricks and other erratic behavior--the guy is pretty clearly loaded. Not a good idea when you are dealing with flames, knives, and young children. The food gets finished and served; nice sized portions as I noted. Quality wise, it is decidedly average compared to some other Japanese steakhouses in the area. Then the bill arrives. 2 adult hibachi chicken dishes, 1 kid's hibachi, some crab nigiri for my youngest, and a couple of drinks comes to $90 + tip. There are much better places in the area for quality and value...and chefs that aren't tanked."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Not bad but nothing to go out of the way for. I only had the sushi and some of the rolls were good. But I ordered the eel and avocado roll and I don't think there was any eel in it. Ok in a cinch but that's it."}
{"text":"Sushi is excellent, Hibachi is just ok but I was disappointed with our experience last night.  We had a coupon from the Clipper magazine.  One coupon said buy one hibachi dinner get one free. There was also a $10 coupon off of a $50 purchase.  When we tried to use the coupon for the free dinner $17.95 , the waiter only took $10 off the bill   I asked him and he showed me the fine print that stated it was a max discount of $10.  I felt this was false/poor advertising so I'm not sure I'll be returning anytime soon on principle alone.  I am hooked on their sushi though.  Just want others to be prepared if they think they are actually getting a free meal."}
{"text":"Found decent reviews for this place and decided to bring a group there for my husband's birthday. My first clue should have been that they had no problem accommodating a reservation at any time in a Friday night. 
When we inquired about sake bombs the waitress actually looked like she was disappointed in us and said we weren't allowed to bang on the table. Also, no attempt at any birthday celebration post- meal was made.
The prices were high for what was just ok.
The chef was actually creepy and was clearly making fun of us.
The decor was nonexistent. 
If you're looking to celebrate this is not your place!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch and it was tasty, for the most part. The real benefit to me was the lunch special in which you get a choice of 2 preselected Sushi rolls and a choice of miso soup or salad, for only $8.95. Yes please. Here's what I ordered:

Miso Soup - this was the 1st item to arrive at the table. When it was set down in front of me, I immediately smelled the BLEACH based cleaning product used to wash the dishes. With the miso soup being so delicate, it was severely overpowered by the chemicals. I sent it back and informed the server of my experience and she respectfully removed the soup and brought me salad. I highly recommend that they use a less severe, yet still effective, cleaning solution with the porous, plastic dinnerware and utensils. These items absorbed the soap and emitted their strong odor, which was unfortunately, very off putting.

Ginger Salad - iceberg lettuce, followed by a center concentrated dollop of the ginger dressing. Nothing special and not worth eating being that iceberg lettuce has \"0\" nutritional value.

Jalape√±o Yellowtail appetizer- this was delicious. The sauce that covered it was a bit sweet , which sweet sauces aren't my thing, but I added some soy sauce and proceeded to highly enjoy it.

Spicy Tuna - was a basic roll done right. Yumsters.

Shrimp Tempura Roll - this roll also had cucumber and avocado inside. This was also a simple roll that was good.

This restaurant offers a worthy deal for lunch."}
{"text":"Review for sushi only.

Husband and I came here on a Friday night. We got lucky and got ourselves a table, few parties after us had to grab a seat at the bar but no wait at any point for a seat during the night that we could see.

we ordered the sushi for two which came with two salads and soups, tuna roll, two special rolls (chef's choice) and combination of sashimi and nigri (chef's choice) - $55. I appreciated that we could ask for a few things to be not included, we asked for no mackerel and no cream cheese in the rolls and they accommodated without question.

Knocked off a star for the wait - it was way too long, way too long when compared to other sushi restaurants. It looked like other sushi patrons were also not happy about the wait.

Knocked off another star as the restaurant was way too cold, I had to eat in my husband's jacket (on top of my outerwear) and could see that the hostess was also cold as she was working in her jacket.

Service was good, food was good, price is reasonable - we might come back - maybe when the weather is warmer?"}
{"text":"Very average food. Udo tasted pretty salty. Probably will try something else next time"}
{"text":"I very much enjoy the whole package at Tsuki ... The food is terrific and the service is pleasant and the decor is clean and tasteful.

They have the best sushi that I have come across in Charlotte. Artful, fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

Bento boxes are plentiful with all sorts of taste treats.

We usually go for lunch but recently we had dinner there and tried out the hibachi side of the restaurant. That was also a great experience and delicious food. I really do enjoy sitting flame-side and having the chef do all that fast stuff with the knives. Fun stuff. However, be forewarned, you have to know what you're going to do when you come in the door. Turn right and get seated at the normal restaurant tables and order off the extensive menu. Turn left and get seated at the hibachi tables and the chef will cook for you stage center.

The food is spectacular but the wine list and the bar drinks are quite average (at best). So plan accordingly if you want to enjoy any alcohol ..."}
{"text":"The sushi here is decent, nothing overly great or spectacular. The hibachi dinner was okay - salmon tasted so fresh, pretty bland though. Everyone was very friendly, though the service was not great. Did not get one water refill while we were eating dinner. Wouldn't come here for the hibachi show, they don't have many hibachi tables. Overall, it was an okay dinner but we won't be returning. If their prices were lower, maybe but for the same amount of money, I'd much rather go to Kabuto or somewhere. Oh, but they did have a nice atmosphere, nice sushi bar with televisions."}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant with incredibly great tasting Sushi.  So a good friend recommended this place and instead of going to the same ol' Jade that has eye candy male servers for women and no room at the bar for a solo guy, I opted to come here.  Boy did I make the right move. 

I walked in and instantly got greeted by a few staff.  The place was 40% full at 8:30 on Saturday.  Of course I was a little hesitant to continue my experience but thought let me just try some place new and see what my friend keeps raving about.  

I sat at the bar and instead of the conventional pencil and paper to pick my sushi, they gave me an actual 5 page menu.  They offer more then sushi, they actually have a different area for hibachi.   I ordered the seaweed salad, super spicy tuna, and the whitetail sushimi.   I hate seaweed but my girlfriend always tells me to eat it since it's so healthy for you.   Let me tell you the portion was perfect, and the taste....  Awesome!   Not fishy, it was actually a great taste. 

The whitetail blew me away.  A nice big piece that was a little hard to handle with my chopsticks, but the taste was mind blowing!   Is this what real sushi taste like?   Have we been dubbed by too much aioli sauce and American Mayo flavor at these other sushi restaurants?   The super tuna roll was awesome great.  I wasn't expected fried panco bread crumbs on top but I'll exclude it next time.  

The verdict; my go-to sushi place in Ballantyne and South Charlotte.  The ambience is great to take my girlfriend, the staff were super friendly, and the food was perfect.   The only thing that stands out is that I asked for a kettle one and water and she skipped the water.  Hey, these guys are not bartenders, they are incredible Sushi makers.   I'll order Saki next time.  

Thanks guys, you  gained a new regular client."}
{"text":"After buying a Living Social deal for $30 my husband and I were excited to try out a new Japanese place close by. Located in Toringdon shopping center (with the Earth Fare), we stopped in on a rainy Friday around 5:30 for dinner. 

We were immediately seated at a cook top table by ourselves, with only one other couple there with their baby. I thought they might have only had one cook there because as soon as he was done cooking their food he came over to our table and cooked ours. It's a hibachi restaurant so they cook in front of you for dinner. I think for lunch it's more of a sushi place. You can still order hibachi, but the show is not included. 

We both ordered the Chicken Hibachi, which comes with clear soup, a salad, shrimp appetizer, hibachi chicken, vegetables (zucchini, mushrooms, onions, carrots), and both fried rice, and noodles. So much food for $15.95. They also have a good selection of beers. 

The food was very good, although the \"show\" wasn't much of a show. It was like watching someone cook normally on a flat top grill. The highlight being the onion volcano, which the cook had a hard time with... maybe he's new. They actually did have another cook there, who cooked the next couple who came in. He flipped around the spatulas, there was fire, kind of what you expect when you come to these places. So just be aware, it could be hit or miss. 

The amount of food, +the prices, which are pretty reasonable, after our deal + tip we only paid about $14 out of pocket. A nice date night."}
{"text":"Tsuki is a solid 3.5 in my book.

However, since you can't do half stars and they are pretty pricey for now they will get an A-OK 3 stars from me.

Tsuki is an absolutely beautiful space! I used to work in the area and the previous restaurant that was here pails in comparison to the decor now, beautiful wall murals, leather booths and a lovely bar. It's a very nice upgrade!

I met a friend for dinner and as previous reviews have stated the options here are pretty standard, sushi, sashimi, hibachi and fried rice.

For starters, we went with the edamame. I was not a fan. They were a little tough and not seasoned to my liking. Which was a real bummer, because I absolutely love this dish. 

For my meal, I went with the Rock 'N Roll. This is one of there cooked rolls with crab, tempura shrimp, avocado & cream cheese. It was really good. I loved the eel sauce and the freshness of the roll. I would definitely order it again and recommend it to anyone. 

My friend got the chicken hibachi, it was SO much food! It came with soup and salad, a huge portion of fried rice, veggies and chicken. It was very tasty! But you will definitely have leftovers! 

Service was great as well. So I  look forward to coming back, there are a few more rolls I'm really looking forward to trying. 

And if you want to be surprised, the chef will create any kind of roll you want!"}
{"text":"Charlotte does not seem to specialize in sushi. It's so hard finding a good place to have sushi. But I will say, Tsuki has really great sushi. The best I have had in Charlotte. The restaurant is simple and understated, but the sushi and the rest of the food is really good and the service is friendly and comfortably efficient.  We have also experienced the hibachi side of the restaurant which was fun and delicious. We are almost weekly regulars at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant was nice, good decor and all that.  Was seated promptly as I came in for lunch and I ordered dumplings, filet habachi, and a soda.  Already my cost was nearly $20, so it's not cheap.  The dumplings were good and I got a refill or two with my soda.  The steak filet habachi could have been better though; it was more geared to be pleasing to the eye, so the platting looked nice with the funny cut orange on the side.  The sauces were difficult to manage though as two different sauces shared the same plating, so dumping the sauce on the food without spilling the other was impossible, I also had no spoon so I used the fork to best deal with it (not everyone dips).  The steak filet didn't really taste that it was of a quality filet, but no matter.  After completing my meal I was still hungry, but I dared not to order more food since my tab was already high for a lunch.  Overall, I have had better, not likely to go back."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that one can not give zero stars. So any one star review can easily be interpreted as no stars. The steak and scallops was over cooked. Should have known this wasn't going to go well when we entered and waited several minutes before we were seated. It was a fairly slow Tuesday night. Service was rude as they said awful things to us not knowing that I also spoke Chinese."}
{"text":"Bad experience!!!!! Manager was rude and does not make any sense. 
You have a take out menu that says you get noddles with a dinner combination, but yet when you order it to go you do not get noddles at the same price. 
There are way better tasting and service Japanese Steak Houses & Sushi Bars in Charlotte. 
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Tsuki is one of the best sushi places in Ballantyne. Not only is it always consistently delicious, but the service is amazing. I come here often and am never disappointed. If you're looking for some top-notch quality sushi and Hibachi, look no further."}
{"text":"Skip this one!  After sitting down at the grill we noticed that our table was covered in a greasy film.  The hibachi grill and surrounding area was filthy, parts were covered in grease and looked as if they haven't been cleaned.  Our cook was very nice and personable but.... he was not very good at KnifeFu and over cooked everything.  Not sure how you overcook fried rice but it happened.  Wait staff was good and filled my drink several times."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and we were seated right away. The menu has all the items you expect in a Japanese restaurant  - sushi, hibachi, teriyaki, etc.  The decor is nice and modern and the service is attentive. I ordered the 10 piece sashimi lunch and an eel and avocado roll.  My hubby got the vegetable teriyaki bento box. My plate had 9 pieces of sashimi and one piece of a decorative crab stick - kinda of bummer when the menu said 10 pieces of sashimi. Other than that - we enjoyed our lunch and we'll be back."}
{"text":"This was really a nice place to dine!
we went there with my inlaws and husband and we had a great time. not only they sat us down right away (it was friday night, you cannot find that many places without a waiting time to sit) but the place was small and cozy.
The hibachi show was really good. The cook was very entretaining and engaged us in the show.
Food was great too.. not sure about the reviews below that say its not good.. i liked it a lot and it was a lot!
We will def. be back :)"}
{"text":"Seriously if you like sushi and hibachi this place is off the charts with fresh creative food!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Very clean restaurant. Staff is wonderful. Nice place to hang out. Food is excellent!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for my wife's birthday dinner after seeing a coupon in the Clipper.  The place is very nice and modern with one side being a bar and dining tables and the other side having three large hibachi tables.  The service was very good, the food was good, and the sushi was good.  They also give you a free fried cheesecake on your birthday which was very nice.  I'd say the place is nicer and cleaner than most hibachi places in Charlotte even if it is a little smaller.  The prices are about the same as the other places too."}
{"text":"I am an idiot.  Why, you ask?  Because i went back.

My Shrek-sized waitress walked away for ten minutes so I went to the bar to ask for more water.  She then comes around the corner and gives me a disgusted look.  After that, she wouldn't respond to me even when spoken to.  Another waitress (who was lovely) came and closed us out.

What a vile establishment... Never, ever, ever returning to this dump.  You shouldn't either.  

i am actually pissed that i had to give them one star.   You are gross, Shrek!"}
{"text":"Dishonest business that wouldn't honor its coupons from the GoPlaySave Coupon books. We (4 of us) went to Tsuki for lunch on Saturday. We ordered 2 rolls, 2 sashimi lunches, 2 miso soup, 1 fried rice and 4 drinks and our bill came up to over $70. 

Tsuki offers 2 coupons in the book, one that is valid for dinner only (after 4pm) and one that doesn't have any limitations. I tried to use the second one to get $10 off my bill but the waitress wouldn't honor it. 

She first said that it was valid for dinner only. I told her that it wasn't specified on the coupon. She said it was written on the main Tsuki page in the coupon book, but it wasn't. She then told us that the coupon couldn't be applied to \"specials\" which is true, that is what it says on the back, but nothing we ordered that day was a \"special\". She said the Fried Rice was. We replied that the menu didn't say that and, by the way, we ordered another 4 entrees/lunches on top of the rice. She finally said that the whole lunch menu was considered \"specials\" and categorically refused to honor our coupon.

It wasn't our first time there but definitely the last. Dishonest and rude."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised.  Green curry was fantastic!  Excellent appetizer of lobster salad wrapped in avocado....hope they make this again.  Yummy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food me and my family love going here. This is the only place I will eat broccoli its delicious! I recommend this restaurant great job keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars. Rating is because hibachi chef dropped his flipper/spatula and tried to continue using it until I literally told him no. He then proceeded to rinse it off in the side sink (no soap) and cook with it. 

When we went the sanitation rating wasn't great, maybe we saw why. 

The hibachi fried rice was awesome in spite  of above."}
{"text":"we came here for celebratory dinner and had an amazing selection of top notch japanese food. staff were very attentive. will be returning agin to work my way through of the other items available on their extensive menu. also they have really good show on the hibachi section.  I really did enjoy it."}
{"text":"We decided to try Tsuki Japanese Steak House after seeing it was so close to Earth Fare and had great reviews. We weren't disappointed. It was a mostly quiet evening (day before Thanksgiving) & we were over there to pick up our Thanksgiving Dinner from Earth Fare. We haven't ordered Japanese/Chinese food in a very long time, and this was quite a pleasant surprise. A lovely welcome, very clean softly lit place with nice menus (much to choose from, but not overwhelming) and a decent wine list. My husband had the Naki Noodles with Chicken & I ordered the sliced chicken, shrimp & vegetables in a lightly spiced brown sauce. Both DELICIOUS and generous portions. We'll be eating the leftovers tomorrow after Thanksgiving, YUM!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I was not impressed. There were only a few people dining yet it took a little over 30 mins for my rolls. The person who I went with got their food 20 mins before I did and was almost finished by the time my food arrived. The staff was stand offish and tried to give us our bill before I even got my food.

The second time I went was with a regular there and it was a lovely experience. We went in time for the lunch special (3 rolls for 11.95 who could say no?). The rolls came out in a reasonable amount of time and the staff were all super friendly. I'm sure to visit them again but I will probably stick to their lunch."}
{"text":"Husband wanted some Japanese for dinner on Sunday, so we decided to go pick some food up from here. When he brought the food home, the way that the food was plated in the to-go boxes made it look so appetizing. I ordered the shrimp hibachi and that came with salad, soup, appetizer shrimp and fried rice. My husband ordered the salmon and steak hibachi dinner. The dressing that came with the salad, I could have drunk a gallon of it, it was so good. The soup was also delicious. The veggies with came with the meal as cooked to perfection. They were cooked done but still with a bite. That's the way I like my veggies.  The shrimp and fried was very flavorful as well. My husband also enjoyed his meal. My meal was so good, I wanted to go back the next day and do it all over again. But my husband don't like eating the same thing twice in a week, so I am just going to have to go by myself. I will definitely be back soon. The reason for the 4 stars out of 5 is because my husband thought the price was alittle steep. But I had to remind him that this is not a take out hibachi place but one that you can sit at the Teppanyaki table to eat. So maybe that's where the cost come in at."}
{"text":"I went here with A $30 Groupon.  It just happened to be on half price wine night, which seemed to be a nice added bonus, since alcohol is not included in the Groupon anyway!  No go.  They said we couldn't have them both.  It was either/or.  We went to have sushi.  It was decent sushi, our server was fine, I didn't get upset at him because it wasn't his rule, but for a first time, and seemingly this place doesn't seem to be that busy and is competing with the well known Nakato and Kabuto just minutes down the street, I would think that they would try to be accommodating to ensure that they get repeat business and positive recommendations.  That isn't the case.  I will not be back on account of the fact that we left on a negative note, and their sushi is not any different or better than the 5-6 places nearby that I'm familiar with already.  It didn't wow me so, their loss because I am a frequent sushi eater and I would have been a great person to win over to be a regular.  I'm right down the street and it is convenient.  My old trusty yummy sushi places... I'm still yours"}
{"text":"Oh how I have wanted so badly to have this place be my new go to place for to go sushi (did you like how I did that there haha), but the only thing I wanted after my takeout experience there was a time machine so that I could go back in time and make a better choice as to where I got my dinner that evening.

I like the fact that they have online ordering so I placed an order for sushi at 4:40pm and it gave me an estimated pick up time of 15-20 minutes.  That seemed ambitious so I figured I would go there around 20-25 minutes after I placed my order just to be safe, but all that did was result in me sitting in the seating area by the register for about another twenty minutes while I looked around at the multitude of employees bringing in supplies presumably for the dinner rush. I thought by placing my order at 4:40pm I would avoid a long wait but it was about 40-45mins before my order was finally ready even though the restaurant was at less than 20% capacity at the time.

Oh well I thought, maybe the food would turn things around but boy was I wrong again. It's not that anything was bad as the food was...hmmm I guess average would be the best word to describe it. Not much flavor, no freshness shining through, it was just eh, a solid 5 out of 10 you could say, but if I want 5 out of 10, there are tons of sushi spots in Charlotte that can give that and I wouldn't have to pay Ballantyne prices to get it!

Even though it is close, I won't be going back as the quality, service and value just doesn't justify the pricing."}
{"text":"Tsuki is beautiful on the inside.   The sushi is pretty good - nothing that is out of this world of very impressive.  The staff is always very friendly, and they're usually pretty quick.  It could be cheap (for just a roll or apps)  or be very expensive - it's up to you.  The menu is very large, so I usually have a hard time focusing on what I want to eat - especially if I want to try something new.

It's nothing special, but for the price, and proximity to home, I'm pleased."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! I had the chicken and steak hibachi dinner and it was one of the best I have ever had!!!First time here and will be back."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Marriott and walked over to Tsuki. It's a very comfortable environment in a great location. I was apprehensive at first because it was small and the sanitation score wasn't above 95 but I thought I would try it and the scallops and filet hibachi was great. Perfectly seasoned and tender. You get a lot of food for the money."}
{"text":"I used to work in the Toringdon shopping center and would often take advantage of Tsuki's \"Lunch Bento Box\" special. As a vegetarian, I would order the teriyaki veggie option. For less than $9 you get rice, teriyaki vegetables, tempura (deep-friend) vegetables, 4-5 pieces of (basic) sushi, and your choice of soup or salad. It's a great lunch deal and I would usually have left-overs afterwards.

The inside is clean, trendy and quite nice. It seems like it would be a fun place for a date night, or a girls' night out. They have a pretty large bar area, too. The staff are friendly and helpful.

I didn't give it four stars because I have gotten the veggie lunch bento box several times, and the quality has not been consistent. Some have been absolutely amazing, others have been sub-par, and some have just been average. Please try to be consistent, guys! I want to love you!"}
{"text":"Has been my favorite place to go for a few years now - always wondered when the shoe would drop....   guess you can't have good food AND good service!!!!


Will admit I usually come at dinner - tried lunch today - maybe it is like a strip club - where the better crew works at night!!!!

Very sad - hard to find good Japanese steakhouse....."}
{"text":"Just ate a very entertaining dinner here!  The chef made it a fun evening!  The food was tasty and the service was good."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quality and quantity of food. Best hibachi sauce I've had and the service was very attentive for a Friday night.  This was our third choice after trying to secure a res at the other hibachi places, been to all the others and this place is now our favorite."}
{"text":"Great service.  Coolest Tuesday sushi special ever.  Always a positive experienece.  It's expensive which is the only reason for 4 stars"}
{"text":"I actually ate there about a month ago.  But I didn't want to post because I don't like posting when I'm mad.

We were really excited to try this place since our favorite sushi place recently closed.  But the whole experience was a train wreck.

My wife has allergies to pickled ginger, so we have to let servers know about it.  Of course the plate shows up with picked ginger on it.

Then the sushi tasted off.  We didn't like it.  We didn't want to make a big deal.  We just wanted the check so we could go find some food we could actually eat.  So we asked for the check and let them know we didn't want a box.

That's when it really went badly.  They sent no less than four people to grill us about why we didn't enjoy their food.  I just wanted to pay the check and leave...not be held hostage while they refused to bring me back my credit card.  So finally I called out that if they didn't bring my card back, I'd just call it in as stolen.  

All I wanted, was to leave.  Now I hope their business fails and they go into debt over it.  Few places manage to piss me off so completely.

And if they actually read Yelp reviews, I have one final message.  If someone refuses to shake your hand, you probably should get out of his face and let him leave."}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls and roll selection. Staff is always fast and polite. Great for lunch or a week night sushi dinner."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. Sushi is fresh and delicious. Try the pork dumplings and teriyaki steak."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese restaurant operated by non-Japanese folks, first of all. That is a serious problem for any Japanese person or the Japanese food experts.
I had Chirashi today and I was very very disappointed. Even though I asked the sushi man before I ordered my Chiarashi if the fish are all fresh and he of course said \"yes\", 2/3 of the fish I got on my Chirashi were not fresh. There were Tuna, Salmon and Yellow tail, 3 pieces each to make it 9 pieces and not 10 pieces as the menu says. Yellow tail was okay, but the tuna and salmon looked like they were sliced at least yesterday and just unwrapped from saran wrap. 
Another disappointment is the soy sauce they use. It's not Kikkoman, it's not Yamasa. I think it is a Chinese soy sauce which is totally not suitable for sushi because the flavor is much different from the Japanese soy sauce.  Wasabi was tasteless. Other than the fish and the rice, there were only the fish, 1 leaf of shiso, and shredded daikon. Very boring presentation for a Chirashi. My lunch companions all had cooked dishes from the Hibachi menu, and they looked good and they all seemed to be enjoying their food. This place is probably not for sushi but for Hibachi grilled dishes."}
{"text":"A lot of the comments had complained about the amount of time they had to wait at this hibachi restaurant. I don't think that is a fair criteria to use to rate a hibachi place. This was our 4th hibachi restaurant and at all of them we had to wait at least 20 minutes to either be seated or to order...in our opinions it comes with the territory of hibachi style eating. 

That being said, we really enjoyed this hibachi place. Service was good, probably the best we've had. Very attentive staff. Wasn't too busy on a Friday night. Food was good, but not the best we've had compared to other hibachi places. 

I am not a fan of teriyaki so I was pretty disappointed that their staple ingredient for all the noodles, veggies, and meats was teriyaki sauce. I wish the would have listed their chicken as teriyaki chicken instead of just plain chicken. 

Yes I would recommend trying this place, but would caution those who do not like sweet teriyaki Japanese food."}
{"text":"I went here to get some quick lunch. The sushi was delicious and the service was fast. They don't have a real hostess so other customers were standing there confused. I think they should provide napkins for to go. But overall I'll return again."}
{"text":"Any time I think of a place that is in \"Toringdon\", I sort of dread it - is it on the left (difficult to get into because of exiting off of 485)? Is it on the right (who knows how to get in there, because of all the people going to Earth Fare)? How will I know? When will I know? Once I find it, how in the world will I get back? Regardless, they do have some decent options, so I keep trying out places, and likely will continue to do so.

In the case of Tsuki, it was reasonable, but I have to say it may not have been worth all the effort. If I lived nearby, then I would likely give them some other chances. Or if I was staying in the hotel across the street, I would perhaps risk my life by scampering across the street to check it out (note: the smallish street to cross near Earth Fare - no way would I scamper across Johnston on foot, I barely do that in a car). 

Service was friendly enough, it just wasn't particularly memorable beyond that, and as a result, it goes back to the bottom of the list in case I'm looking for something different - but there are plenty of other options, even in Toringdon, so I suspect it won't be near the top for a good while."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and noticed there wasn't a lot of people there. We asked to sit in the hibachi section and we literally had our own table. I ordered the hibachi lobster, steak and shrimp. I think it's a nice bonus that it came with rice and noodles. My lobster was really overcooked and tough. Steak and shrimp was ok. The chef wasn't very interactive or friendly. Boyfriend got the sushi and he liked it. I think we will probably go back again. Food just wasn't amazing. The atmosphere is nice and cozy."}
{"text":"This Hibachi/Sushi duo was a great find for us as new Ballantyne residents. The service and food were great and the prices were about $2-3 lower than most competitors in the area. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Asian restaurant with a little bit of everything at a decent price! Excellent sushi, hibachi, Thai, Chinese...My kids even raved about the food!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, stopped here reluctantly because I was staying at a hotel nearby and I was in a mood for some udon.  It's pretty tough to mess up udon, I said to myself. I guess I was dead wrong. The dish was basically noodles in a wonton soup. What a fusion MESS!  Not sure what to make of it.  The description should read: udon in a wonton soup wth no wontons.  Soooo I decided to treat it like wonton and asked for hot chilly oil.  She brings me Srircha sauce. When I asked again for the chilly, she says, \"this is better.\"  When I asked her if they didn't have what I was asking for, she reluctantly goes and grabs me some.  I think I know what is better for me.  In fact, I know what is better for you. It is to get what I asked for -- thought to myself.  To be fair, the shrimp tempera that accompanied the soup was good but man, how can they mess this simple dish up?  Although this place appears to be a Japanese restaurant, they have Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food on their menu. This is not uncommon when you're outside major urban areas but if you're going to do that, at least get some basics right.  If I wanted a wonton soup, I could of grabbed one at Wok and Roll at the airport for $3 and not for $12.  Also, I ordered California roll except it didn't have any masago on it. When I asked, they said it would be extra charge.  Okay, so let me get this straight Ms. Ambiguously-Asian-fusion lady, it's extra charge for something that the dish should already have as standard. It's like ordering a pizza and charging extra for tomato sauce.  Maybe I've been spoiled living in NYC but this place is whack yo!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and head here for lunch. The lunch deals they have are great. I'm pretty easy to please and enjoy straightforward sushi rolls that are tasty and not necessarily fancy. The three roll lunch is perfect for what I'm looking for and the kani salad is delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout online. WIsh I checked the bag. I placed an order for a deluxe sushi package. And only 1/2 the order was there. I work 10 minutes away, and was at lunch, so I just cut it as a loss. My first experience with this place is my last. How can you forget 1/2 the order?"}
{"text":"We did takeout on Christmas night and the food was very good ... would like to try dining onsite next time!"}
{"text":"I passed this spot as I was heading to a different Thai/sushi place for lunch. When, thanks to a red light, I quick googled this place and realized their lunch special was .50 cheaper than the other place (8.50 for two rolls and soup/salad compared to 9.00). So I made the left instead of going straight. 

I was seated immediately in a quiet, quaint strip mall gem and asked what I wanted to drink. The servers were quite nice and never rushed me through anything. Everything that came out was fresh and tasty. I enjoyed everything, miso soup, spring rolls, spicy tuna roll and a boston roll. I will say that the filling inside the spring roll was a little thin compared to other places I've had them at, but that would be my only, trivial complaint. 

So why the four stars and not five? There wasn't anything here that blew me out of the water, but all in all, it is a solid sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"My husband has been here for lunch a few times and stated that he enjoyed his experiences, so we gave it a try for dinner.  The restaurant looks nice from the inside and outside, a much nice appearance from many other japanese restaurants that I have been to.  The menu was very hard to read in their lighting given that they are displaying it inside of Office Max-like page protectors.

The dishes that we did try, sounded like the usual menu items found at other Japanses restaurants, but the acutal food we received was different.  The hibachi chicken was served on a large, soupy bed of green bell peppers.  The tempura chicken was completely flavorless. Much different than usual Japanse food I have eaten.  Definitely not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and sushi...odd smell to e place though which kind of makes you wonder.  The hibachi chef was very entertaining and we enjoyed chatting with him."}
{"text":"Food - consistently good
Service - declining

Ok...I've been going to this spot for a while for my two-roll sushi lunch special.  I'm a creature of habit, so I would typically get a Boston Roll and Shrimp Tempura roll.  For quite some time, they were delicious.  However, last few times, I noticed the Boston Roll had an off taste and honestly not good.  Because of that, I haven't been for a while.  Today, I wanted some Hibachi, didn't want to drive far, and thought I would give their Hibachi a try.  Hibachi Scallop it was.  Well, the meal itself was OK; slightly salty....glad I didn't add any salt prior to tasting.  In fact, I liked it well enough to order again.  

Here's my problem.  The young lady at the register today was not friendly at all.  She didn't smile, didn't greet me, other than to say what did you order.  Everything about her said she didn't want to be there or be bothered.  I (as I have done in the past) asked for extra ginger dressing.  Yes, I like lots of dressing on my salads.  Never have I been charged anything additional.  I told her so, and even said if I were eating in, would you charge me extra?  No response.  I actually think she took pleasure in charging me more.  Not that I couldn't afford it, but I don't understand that practice. Why charge me more when I ask for extra condiments when I'm taking it to go. Even when I do carry out and tips are accepted, I always tip.  Today, I did not.  Say what you will, but I won't tip anybody for giving me attitude.  I can get that for free.  

Side note:  there use to be the nicest lady at the front register.  I guess she has moved on because I haven't seen her in a while.  Wish she would come back."}
{"text":"A solid 3 and almost a 4 but unable to give half stars . I was there at 6:30 on a Wednesday evening. I was the only person in the restaurant but there were two full hamachi tables in the adjacent room. I had the summer roll which itself was a little bland but the peanut sauce (which I usually avoid) was very good and not too salty. I opted for the sashimi deluxe which is a chefs choice of 15 prices. Mine came with be standard spicy tuna and salmon but also included  white tuna. It was all fresh and the salmon was like butter but the white salmon seemed a little lacking in flavor. Overall for service, quality and value I recommend but it is not not an overly traditional or higher end sushi place. Nice for groups but wouldn't call it romantic, intimate or recommend for a special couples dinner."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! The sushi was very fresh! Great service as well! I highly recommend this place to someone who is looking for an Asian-fusion themed style restaurant! The hibachi grill was exciting, they cook in front of you and perform a decent show! Would come back again. :)"}
{"text":"It's an adequate hibachi place, but the prices are high in my opinion for what you get.  I had a Living Social coupon, but I don't think I would eat here again without a coupon.  The steak and shrimp hibachi combo, for example, is $24.  Also, the menu states you are supposed to get a \"shrimp appetizer\" and we did not receive this.

Food quality was very good.  The hibachi/\"show\" part was so-so.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here overall and would definitely visit them again!

The roll we ordered was very tasty along with the tofu pad thai. Portions are very generous and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Quiet little spot tucked away in the Earth Fare shopping center, away from all the other Ballantyne eateries. Came here for a quick lunch with my friend to celebrate his last day at his now old job. They have a filling yet ordinary bento box lunch special for $8.95 (shrimp teriyaki) that includes 6 decent size shrimps, rice, 4 rolls of California Roll, veggies tempura and a choice of soup/salad. Their sushi were reasonably priced (spider roll $7.50 and crispy spicy tuna roll $6.95) and ok in size, perfect for lunch.

Service was ok, took awhile to get food when the place was empty.I hope it was due to day after Thanksgiving or I am afraid for their survival. 

Overall a decent sushi spot for lunch down in that area when you have extra time on hand."}
{"text":"You could almost never go wrong with a Benihana or hibachi style Japanese restaurant. This place is no exception. Service was great the Chef cooking the table had a great sense of humor would really catered to the people around cooking surface. The food was fresh and cook the way you like it. They had a great bar."}
{"text":"The place is nothing special, but the sashimi was terrific.  Got some unfiltered sake and it was a great experience.  A lot of take out folks coming in and regulars in the restaurant. Good job."}
{"text":"If you love butter than this is the place for you! The Hibachi chefs were hilarious tho. The food was ok and the place is nice. The area is awesome of course. Butter-Oil lovers rejoice!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure if some of the other reviewers ate at the same place that I did but I think Tsuki is great. The sushi is good, fresh and well priced. the hibachi is very tasty. the people are nice and welcoming and genuinely happy to see you. I've eaten here several times and plan to keep going. The 20% off they offer on dinners over $25 is a really great deal."}
