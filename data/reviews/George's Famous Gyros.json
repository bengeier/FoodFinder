{"text":"I've been coming to George's for around 3 years since I live close by. However, I will never come back after the horrible customer service today. I ordered a gyro plate over the phone for take out. When I got there to pick up my food I looked and saw that it was a gyro. I asked to make it a plate and was told that I would be charged for a gyro platter in addition to the gyro I had in front of me because I said plate and not platter. I was told, \"we don't have a gyro plate, we have a gyro platter.\" I've ordered dozens of times before and have never had a problem with the nit-picking of plate vs platter. They could have just thrown a scoop of rice in the box next to my gyro and charged me a dollar more and I would have been completely happy. Instead they chose to lose a customer of 3 years."}
{"text":"Best gyros in the valley! Amazing food. Fast, Fair, and plentiful! The service is an order taker, cashier, server and bus person rolled into one great young gal, who does it all with a smile and a quick fun wit. Wide menu. Some of their pasta plates are fantastic in an old school way. Chicago Greek food at its best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, can't go wrong with the Traditional Gyro, the chicken supreme gyro is also very crucial, served with fried or a Greek salad for under 9.00. Fresh made to order food that will keep you coming back for more. Delicious.   Check in on Yelp & get a free drink*"}
{"text":"I went here the other day and ordered the falafel, I couldn't eat them. They were very hard, and dark looking which I'm guessing they were burnt. I am very disappointed!  I thought I couldn't taste them right , I even let my friend eat some and she said, she couldn't take a second bite!!"}
{"text":"This place does a great business because their food is SO good. I love the souvlaki and always look forward to a trip to George's. The young lady who appears to man the restaurant single- handedly  is always  so friendly, even while getting swamped with the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"YES! Simple but delicious... Ive had the gyro so far and it was pretty good. Im sure happy to have them around the corner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I come here almost on a weekly basis. This is the best gyro place in ariozna and you have to come down here to try it. Also, staff is really friendly nice"}
{"text":"Good gyro.  For about $1 more than the gyro sandwich, get the gyro platter which comes with 2 pitas, fries AND salad and feeds two people.  Inexpensive and pretty good, the fries and gyro were greasy and the fries were covered in pepper.  There was also a lot of dressing on my salad."}
{"text":"This is a simple restaurant setup that was rock'n. Busy with all kinds of professionals. We had the gyros and side salad. They were BOMB! I got a side chicken breast for my 9 1/2 month old and he devoured it. The gyros were stuffed with lots of good quality meat and the tatziki  sauce was outstanding . Highly recommend this eatery to everyone! Yummy. Service was excellent as well. Can't wait to visit here again."}
{"text":"Always great food, great prices, and quick and friendly service.  I usually get the original with a salad and I've never left hungry.  Don't forget to check-in for a free drink.  Thanks, E"}
{"text":"The best gyros around. I'll pass 5 other spots closer and come here. The food is great and the service is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"My tummy is happy! fave: Gyro Picado & Spaghetti with sausage and marinara sauce"}
{"text":"George's Famous Gyros is located in a slightly ghetto strip mall next to a gas station, \"massage\" parlor, hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint, and a mail box store. From the outside it may not look like much but upon entering the dark exterior you immediately find that this is quite the popular lunch spot!   My friend, Jillana, and I ventured into this hot spot at around 12:30pm on a Thursday. The tables were packed and there was already 6-7 people in line ahead of us. Despite the crowd our food was served in a matter of minutes and the owner, operating the cash register, noticed that we were new customers and offered up drinks on the house. A rarity for today's economy! The owner was extremely helpful and attentive (readily changed our order from din in to to-go and made sure we had plenty of napkins and plastic-ware before he sent us on our way).   The place itself is rather small but has a rather fun, lively lunch vibe to it. I always love the 80's posters of the attractive Greek bushy-eyebrowed brunette enjoying a big gyro :-) Not sure how busy it is around the dinner hour but it seems that this place will certainly not be going out of business anytime soon.   My friend and I both opted for the classic Greek gyro, costing only $7.30 after tax. Great prices! The sandwich was quite tasty. The meat was well seasoned, packed with flavor. The fries were quite good and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her Greek side salad. The only drawback was that the meat was a tad on the greasy side for my taste. However, this would not deter me from frequenting George's. Next time I would ask for extra tzatziki, there was some on the sandwich but I would have liked a bit more. Plus, I love dipping my fries in the rich creamy goodness as well.   Overall, quite a good experience. Price, good. Service, good. Food, goooooood."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service even better lol.. Katie was the highlight by giving me more information on the food and beverages that would best compliment the meal. Hands down must try I guarantee you will love it 10/10 service 10/10 food absolutely excellent!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gyro and gyro supreme=wow. Chicken gyro=wow. The hummus and appetizers are just ok, but if you want to experience a great gyro, you will not be disappointed. Honestly, I don't think I can I get a gyro anywhere else now because this is just so good. Don't let the kind of crummy strip mall scare u away. If you're in the area, check it out!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that's not hidden these days because it has gained a great, well deserved reputation.  The food is delicious, varied, and affordable, and the service is generally sublime.    Sublime, you say, a carryout?  It does have a sizable dining area where one can eat, so it's not just a carryout.  When you enter, go up to the cash register, order and then someone will bring you your food.  If you're really lucky, that someone will be Katy, the cashier/waitress par excellence who seems to thrive when there's a crowd, which there usually is.  She is a master multi-tasker who can work the register, answer the phone, deliver the food to the tables and do it all with a smile on her face, as if you're the only customer in the place--quite an amazing accomplishment.  The menu has a lot of offerings including the standard gyros, souvlakis, and falafel.  The sandwiches come with salad or fries, or you can order a platter that comes with the meat,  breat, salad and fries, all for under $11.00.  I usually get the gyro sandwich supreme with fries and extra veggies in the gyro, very yummy, and all for just $8.50.  The falafel sandwich is also delicious, and well made.   The restaurant also has many pasta offerings, salads, soup, hamburgers, desserts--pretty much everything you would expect, plus a lot more.  The cheesecake is really delicious, by the way.  It carries Mexican bottled drinks, as well as the usual soda fountain drinks.  Overall, I love eating here.  It has a great vibe because of Katy and the owner, who are there most of the time.  It's very well run, clean, cheap, has good food and is relaxing,   Make this place one of your go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Made my order wrong twice and took over 40 minutes! Huge Waste of time."}
{"text":"There are some things you know aren't the healthiest for you but oh are they so good. George's Famous Gyros is a place around the corner from where i live so I indulge myself from time to time with their gyros. They truly are the best in town that I've had. The meat is moist and tasty (bordering on greasy) and stuff into the pita. You'll never think they skimped on it, it overfills the pita. Great stuff, that I wouldn't recommend having on a daily basis but man in that moment there are few things better. They really should get a mobile version of this and open up at 2am to clean up with the drunk crowd."}
{"text":"Been here many times now. Food is absolutely outstanding!  Very nice people inside. Food is always so fresh. Excellent for take out though you can sit there and eat. Strip plaza isn't appealing but this place is a rare gem!"}
{"text":"I spent a crazy day running errands around Scottsdale and found myself next to George's at 3pm while returning a projector. The server was friendly and service quick. I took my chicken gyro and a Greek salad down the street to Papago Park. Highly recommended! It was a perfect picnic!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  George's Gyros makes it fresh when you order. We eat here every chance we can when we're on this side of town.  The service has always been great and everything is perfect and tasty every time we go.    Note that this is NOT a fast food place and you are probably better off taking your hungry, tired kiddos to McDonalds or Taco Bell; you will wait a little longer for your meal to be prepared (fresh) than going through a drive thru - so please keep that in mind before you go here.  If you ARE in a hurry and need a gyro fix your best bet is to simply order ahead as take out so it will be ready for you when you get there."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood place.  The woman taking care of the restaurant was in constant motion - handling take out, dine in and at the same time talking with each guest to make sure everyone was welcomed - and in her free time she restocked and got ready for the next order.  The food was every bit as good as the service. I had the Supreme Gyro with fries and all of the vegetables were extremely fresh and tasty.  Next time I may go with the regular because the serving was large!  Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Discovered this place randomly and the food is real good. Restaurant is good with good ambience. I had the gyro picado and it was very filling. If you in Scott's and you need some gyro go here"}
{"text":"The place is poorly ventilated, The decorations suck, The staff  may have a grumpy attitude... But the gyros are so damn good it does not matter!!"}
{"text":"Georges Famous Gyros, on McKellips Rd., has more than just gyros.  Their meatballs (sandwich with 3 or spaghetti with 5) are really good.  I always get a salad with my food here and the Greek salad they make is consistently fresh and very good with a Greek style vinegar and oil dressing.  You can also get french fries.  The original gyro (my fav) with a salad is 4 meals for me.  The tzatziki sauce is a mild cucumber sauce that is a nice complement to the gyro meat, onions, tomatoes and pita bread.  If you want a spicier Gyro you need to get the Gyro Picado with grilled onions, peppers and jalapenos.  If I had any complaints about Georges it would be the fountain drinks.  This is a minor thing to me but could sway a customer.  Since I do not like sodas offered or any cola, etc., I will get the water or iced tea.  Their water needs to be filtered and could be better.  That would earn Georges another star with me.  And to Chris, whom posted that there is lettuce in their gyros, there is no lettuce in them.  That leads me to believe you have not eaten there and is a fake poster with another agenda.  Very disappointing.  Most of their meals are under $7.00 and as I said, I will get more than two meals out of them.  Also their Baklava is home made and a nice treat.  Oh, one more thing, the falafel is good."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! Service is great and the gyros are loaded with meat!  I highly recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Great food. Great people. Had the pleasure of speaking with the owner's son. Very nice guy, told me the history and that his Greek family has a lot of roots in Chicago. I spent time in Chicago and this particular restaurant is authentic as you can get in the U.S. Amazing."}
{"text":"For what you get, Georges can't be beat.  At least in the valley.  The gyros are huge, affordable and very flavorful.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  They make a good hot dog too.  I dig it.  I'm a simple man."}
{"text":"Best greek food ive ever had. My coworkers and i frequent this place as often as we can. Staff is amazing"}
{"text":"More than meets the eye... Ha HA!!!! I took my wife here for lunch and she about punched me when we walked in for taking her to a hole in the wall. I told her to be patient and give it a try.   I can't speak to the whole menu, but I'm pretty much addicted to the Steak Pita. She doesn't usually eat meat but I wanted her to try the steak pita that I am in love with and also the fries which are most of the time TERRIFIC! I don't even care for fries normally, but leave it to George to serve some of the best french fries I've had.  Well, she actually ate steak...at a hole in the wall...and liked it...a lot! Ha HA!!! I make her eat it (her words). I was right, she was wrong. George's is good. I don't have to sleep on the couch tonight.  FYI, I like my steak pita marinated/cooked with the vinaigrette sauce and then I add ceaser dressing on top for even more flavor. MMmmmm...I can taste the onions, tomatoes, steak, and pita in my mouth dripping with flavorful juices and dressing. Yummy yummy yummy!  The chicken pita made the same way is great too. I'm just not a fan of the Euro sauce."}
{"text":"Grade A lamb gyro for sure. Fresh tasting and cooked well, the overflowing amount of food provided will leave you satisfied. The ambience is somewhat lacking but I came for a feast, not to hang out. And feast I did. Prices are ok. Will definitely be returning to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Girl at the front desk is very friendly. I always get the Italian beef w/ mozzarella & fries (less than  $10). I think their seasoned fries are worth mentioning also. Will come back regularly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Nothing fancy just awesome fast authentic Greek food like you would find in Chicago.  The mustard style dressing on the chicken pita gets me drooling."}
{"text":"This is the really deal Gyros. I'm from Detroit and grew up going to greek family resturants. The food is great and the staff is awesome. I love small places with staff that makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. Excellent lunch place. Other than the falafel, everything I've ordered here has been good. The price might look a little high, but the portions are solid. Sometimes, they do get backed up during the lunch rush, but for the most part, it's fast. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  I admit it's probably not the best gyro you've ever had nor is it authentic Greek cuisine, but it's tasty, well priced, fast, and they deliver what they promise."}
{"text":"The Best Greek restaurant. Very yummy food. Service is great and the owner is very friendly. Everything I've ordered has been delicious. Great desert. Best Baklava!"}
{"text":"Tasty + cheap = win win.  They definitely don't skimp on the portions either!"}
{"text":"As many of you know, as a college student, our first priority is to save $$$ and get the most bang for our buck. Once George's Famous Gyros entered my world, everything seemed perfect! George's offers some of the freshest and most delicious Greek cuisine I have found in Arizona.   I can gladly recommend their chicken pita. This comes with either a garlic sauce or a gyro sauce, onions, and a pita crammed with sliced seasoned chicken breast. You also have a choice of great tasting fries or a bomb greek salad. All this for $6.75.  I also can recommend the cheese ravioli (cheese ravioli with marinara covered in melted mozzarella cheese) and the Greek pasta salad (rotini pasta with chopped vegetables, feta, with vinaigrette topped with either chicken or gyro meat.  The only downside to George's is that it's only open until 8PM during the week, open until 3PM on saturdays, and closed sundays. Being a college student, my schedule is pretty hectic, and I find myself eating dinner anywhere from 6PM to 12AM, so I generally frequent George's for lunch time. Another downside is the inside. It's pretty no frills, but what it lacks in interior design, it makes up in food quality and taste.  I give George's an easy 5 stars when it comes to DELICIOUS and FRESH Greek food."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here like its a religion, this place is awesome, and the owner is friendly and the staff has always been good to us."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Very greasy though. I think the high review is for the large portions and cheap price. I'd rather have good food than massive amounts of it."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pita with lemon mustard and it hit the spot! The flavor was amazing and the portion size was more than I expected! Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"The best place to get a gyro. Everything on this menu is outstanding. Try everything, you won't be disappointed. Not only having amazing food the staff is great. The employees have great attitudes, are very polite, and love being helpful. The atmosphere is very fun and enjoyable as well. Promise it is the best gyro ever. It's like you are I'n Chicago for your lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This whole in the wall joint has filled my belly and put a whole in my wallet because I can't resist their traditional gyro. The price is right for these large gyros and sandwiches. Don't go here if you expect the typical elegant Scottsdale dining experience. This place gets down to the point and makes good food, while not worrying so much about decor and presentation."}
{"text":"Just moved down the street so decided to try it out.  Ordered the Gyro and mac and cheese bites.  The mac and cheese bites were amazing.  I ate all them before even trying the gyro I was so full that the Gyro was just too much for me so I didn't really give it a try.  Going to go back many more times."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy. I found this place `because it was near my Mom's house. We are from New York, and enjoy seeking out independent ethnic restaurants. George's is great. The place is quite casual, but the staff is friendly, and the food is awesome. Mom had the gyro and fries, I had the felafel and greek salad. We started with spanakopita, wich was super tasty. Our entrees were wonderful, baklava so good that my Mom almost licked the plate. The prices are reasonable. A great experience overall. We'll be regulars."}
{"text":"This place is great. Get the sauce, best I've had on a Gyro. Original is great. Can be greasy sometimes though. Pita is so nice and soft, and you could even split one gyro between two people they are so big. I always pound a whole Chipotle, but sometimes can't finish these."}
{"text":"One of the few Mediterranean food places I'll actually eat, and I regret nothing about it! George's Gyros is almost always filled with friendly faces, and the food itself is worth every single cent. It won't empty your wallet, and instead fill up your stomach! This place is somewhere you'll definitely be coming back to again and again after the first time."}
{"text":"Gonna make it short and sweet. WOW probably the best Gyro i have had since moving down from Chi-town. Been working in the resturant feild for over 30 years and love to try new places, this one really smashed it outta the park. huge heloping of meat, the tz sauce was spactacular and diced toms instead of slice, great idea! will defiantly be going there again and again. So glad that I got the chance to try this place, LOve it George!!!!"}
{"text":"Please try the Falafel burger, they are so good!  I went last night, and can't get it out of my head.  Nice little place, clean, nice employees, the owner obviously really cares about his business.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you I NEVER write yelp reviews but this place is really just that good! My office partner and I are training in Tempe/Scotsdale area for work from California and we found this little gem. First of all the girl at the front is doing the job of ten people at once and is constantly running(taking orders, phone orders, delivering food, etc) but always keeps her cool and she's super sweet. We came twice in a row since the first time was so freakin good! Both times I got the chicken pita and my co-worker got the lamb gyro. Amazing each time with massive portions. Definitely the best pita I've ever had. Be prepared for a little wait because they are super busy with a tiny staff and small kitchen but it is so worth the wait. The saddest part about going back home will be leaving this place behind. Great job you guys! Come franchise in Sacramento any time :)"}
{"text":"It's aight... I'd rate it 3.5 If i could but yelp, yanno? Anyways, the guy that helped me said \"get the mac and chz poppers man, you'll have to get em next time\" ...little did he know... they were aight. Nice fellow though. So all in all, it's aight... and if I drove by again with an appetite, I'd stop by."}
{"text":"Great food and always smiling service! Try the Greek fries with your sandwich or gyro. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"If I'm ever back in the Phoenix area I will make a point of specifically eating at this place. Not only was the chicken gyro just fantastic, but the salad that came with was one of the best salads I have had in ages. I could eat a giant plate of just the salad. Not to mention that just $7 gets you a whole gyro and a generous serving of said fantastic salad. If this place opened a branch in Seattle I'd be there twice a week. Just delicious!"}
{"text":"They Original Gyro is the best around and I LOVE \"George's Pizza\" but watch the specials board. They don't just throw a regular item on there to have something there like other restaurants. A lot of times its empty. BUT, when they cook something special, TRY IT. They've had some awesome pastas and a 'potatoe, bacon, corn' soup to die for!"}
{"text":"I can only talk gyros and Greek salads.....the platter rocks. Forget the fries and go extra large salad for same price. Get dressing on side. Always is if you order out. Atmosphere is not anything to talk about, but gyro platter with extra large salad is!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! The gyros are one of the best in town!! Off the beaten path from where most restaurants are, so don't forget about this little, but GREaT, hole in the wall!! Confident staff and delicious food!! Always a hit and I notice they scored an A for cleanliness!! Double Thumbs up!! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Gyro's but I have had a problem ever since I visited Athens, Greece in 2009, I cannot find a Gyro in the US that even comes close in comparison. Thankfully that journey is over and I can now go about conquering the world, well my world at least.  Upon arriving at George's Famous Gyro's I loved that it was so unassuming in a tiny strip mall that is easy to miss at 40 mph. It truly epitomizes the \"hole in the wall\" restaurant.   My first time at a new place I always ask the staff what the best thing on the menu is to which I was told the 'Famous Gyro\" I ordered that with a salad for around $6.75. I was surprised by two things when I got my food. One, the amount of meat on the gyro was ridiculously awesome, it had to be at least 8 ounces and my wife's gyro was the same so I doubt this was chance. Two, for a salad with an iceberg lettuce foundation it was surprisingly good. The salad was riddled with fresh veggies, great tasting feta and great Greek olives (be careful for the pits)  When I was finished with my meal I promptly told my wife that I was never brushing my teeth again so I could retain the taste from the gyro for as long as possible. Upon further consideration of my marriage I quickly retracted my declaration of no oral hygiene. It is impossible for me to tell you how truly great the flavor was of the 'Famous Gyro\" it was stuffed with gyro meat, onion, tomato and the best tzatziki sauce I have ever had. All in all it is an authentic gyro right here in Arizona.  The seating is somewhat limited but very comfortable. The entire place holds maybe 30-35 people but it doesn't feel crammed. The staff is very friendly and the place was clean.  If you are a gyro fan on any level you simply must visit George's Famous Gyros.  PS: When I visited the place was filled with cops and trust me cops go where the good food is."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look the greatest from the outside, and upon entrance the friend I brought along was really hesitant to stay. Despite the somewhat seedy atmosphere, however, the girl who took our order at the register (I believe her name was Katie) was extremely kind and helpful in describing the dishes and making suggestions. We sat at the tables outside after ordering, and Katie brought out our orders along with napkins and utensils.   Upon receiving the plates, our first impression was amazement at the incredible amount of food we had been served. We then were under the impression that we had died and gone to heaven after digging into the absolutely delicious food. We ordered a Chicken Supreme pita sandwich and a Gyro Platter. Both dishes were pretty standard in cost as far as gyros go, but like I said, we got so much food for what we paid for! There were also bottles of Sriracha to use, which I always appreciate, and we also got free drink coupons from checking in on our Yelp mobile apps.   This place is a MUST! The meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the tzatziki sauce was fresh and flavorful. Both meals came with salads which were incredible and very authentic, full of different veggies and topped with feta and a great oil dressing. We chose rice to accompany the platter which was basic white rice, but was the ideal complementary side. We also had the fries with the gyro which were thick cut and addicting!   I would highly recommend dining here  to anyone and I look forward to returning and trying additional dishes from the menu. The only advantages that their nearby competitor Oliveo Grill holds are the option of delivery and being open late (George's closes at 8 p.m.), but other than that the food at George's Famous Gyros is above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the 1st time. Gyro w/salad for me and gyro w/fries for my friend. The employees were friendly and the food was delicious! Best Greek I've had since moving to Arizona. Will definitely recommend and return. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Once again a great salad here.. But even more impressive is Katie... This girl keeps this place the success that it is...buyer beware she does not receive the tips !!!! I suggest a give card ... Given directly to her!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great salads, fries, pasta and most of they gyros are good.  Today I had the veggie gyro and no bueno :-(  the veggies had a very burnt/bitter taste to them, and the liquid from the veggies made the pita quite soggy.  This is the first bad meal i have had at Georges.  I wanted to do this review to let people know that I would recommend everything EXCEPT the veggie gyro."}
{"text":"Really good food, good prices.  I had an issue where they put the dreaded mustard on a chicken sandwich once after I asked for it not to be there.  Nothing disgusts me more than mustard, and you really can't remove it.  They took it back after I drove it back, and gave me a free lunch for the future.  Big menu, good food, servers are great.  It is what it is, and I like it."}
{"text":"How do they do it?    George's Famous Gyros in Scottsdale (McKellips & Miller) has two combinations I love: great price with huge portions.  Top it off with really good quality, homemade desserts and specials every day, and you have yourself a winner for Greek lunch fare.  In particular, I'm talking about the Gyro Platter (don't confuse with the regular Gyro), which offers two Pitas, a Greek salad, a HUGE pile of crispy and succulent Gyro meat, and french fries.  This platter costs only $9.25 and will feed TWO very big appetites, and probably 3, or even 4, regular to small appetites.  I enjoy it so much I've neglected to try all the other items, except for their Baklava and bread pudding.    Disclaimer: I'm no Baklava connoisseur, but it wasn't the best I've had, due to it seeming a bit dry to me.  (Note I did only try it once.)  The bread pudding was very good, and I appreciate that they make different desserts - it's not always the same.  They have their staple items, such as hummus, pita platters, falafel, tsaziki, Greek salads, and daily lunch specials, etc.  It's enough for you to go back every day for two weeks and not have tried everything.  Their ingredients are good quality, food made to order and tasty.  The accommodation space is setup as a lunch type place.  They use styrofoam plates and plastic forks, emphasizing the fast and delicious aspect, if that gives you an idea.  It's got about 12 tables that seat 4, and a couple tables outside.  I didn't expect to see a good Greek stop at this location, only finding it due to using Yelp.  Don't let that fool you.  Bottom line: If you like Greek food at an absolutely great price, good variety, quality and quantity, you can't beat George's Famous Gyros."}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I am craving a gyro, and let me tell you, once you have George's, you will crave these gyros too. Not only are they delicious, but the portions are huge! So much bang for your buck! This place also has consistently great, prompt service. The owner is super friendly and down to earth. The girls who work the register are always smiling and give great suggestions. If there are any issues with the wait time being too long, they will give you a free drink to make up for it. I've even seen them give free drinks to people when it's their first time coming in. Definitely going the extra mile.  A bit of a \"hole in the wall\", but by far the best gyro you will ever have!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place while on spring break via Yelp. If you like Greek food and Gyros you must go to George's in Scottsdale. If you want a fancy dinning experience go some place else if you want great food go to George's. Gyro platter with salad will feed two to the brim. We're coming back next year and will definitely stop here, next time I'm trying the Vodka tomato pasta."}
{"text":"The best gyros in town!  This place reminds me of the great mom and pop Greek joints in Chicago.  My wife and I drive out of our way frequently to grab a gyro plate.  I have not been able to find a better Greek menu in phoenix area.  They have killer gyros and meatball subs.  The baklava is great too!"}
{"text":"the food here is awesome! the only thing that could improve is a remodel or a really good deep cleaning all over and repaint.  the bathrooms are always gross too but the food quality always keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The meat was especially good because it was spiced right.  My Original Gyro was piled high with meat, I just wished it had a little more tzatziki  sauce with mine - be sure to order a little extra.  It comes with either salad or fries.  My husband, who detests vegetables, was very happy with his \"Porky Athens\"; cubed pork and mushrooms over rice for the \"meat and potato guy.\"  He really enjoyed it.  I would order here again.  Big/large amount of food."}
{"text":"Had the gyro supreme with fries and some pita and hummus. The the pita bread was soft and tasty and served warm. Hummus was good. Great starter. Loved the crisp fresh vegetable in my gyro supreme as well as their meat was flavor just right along with their tasty sauce. Probably one off the best I've had."}
{"text":"Food is good, service gets to suffer if they get busy, order online and save the wait"}
{"text":"I don't know... I just can't get in to this place.   I was reinvigorated to George's greatness by re-reading some reviews. So I scoured the menu and pre-ordered a falafel pita for pickup.   As I remembered the service was not necessarily friendly, nor rude, either - simply adequate.   I paid for extra tzatziki on the side for my side of fries.  The tzatziki on my falafel pita was so sparse (not close to the quantity in the 1 ounce side container) that I had to get some salad dressing to cover the pita with to make it edible.  Less than one slice of tomato was chopped up and 3 medium sized pieces of iceberg constituted the other pita ingredients.  The fries were mostly nicely spiced, and awesome with the tzatziki.  The pita?  Sucked."}
{"text":"Now this is what i call service and good quality food.  Ill stop here every time I'm on this side of town. Thanks guys you rock!"}
{"text":"I don't know what they put on the chicken in the Greek salad - but it's damn near magical.  I get carry-out from here usually once a week.  So far I've only had the Greek salad, but can't wait to try other stuff when I feel like splurging."}
{"text":"The best Gyro place in Scottsdale, or Arizona for that matter.  Awesome, awesome food."}
{"text":"The Greek salad was HUGE!  Definitely get your money's work. The chicken was grilled, but lacked seasoning. The bread pudding was YUMMY!  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! I stick with the traditional gyro and fries. The food is always great, the cashier is great, and I've never had any problems picking it up during my short lunch break when ordering to go."}
{"text":"Food is great, good service, nice atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone who likes gyros and Greek food"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Tempe and love Greek and wanted to try something new and tried this place out and loved it. Love the Chicken Caesar Pita.  The food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great simple place for Mediterranean food. While sometimes the staff isn't the friendliest the food is always ready fast and it is very yummy. About on par with other similar places around and they've modified orders to be vegan or paleo without a hitch. Just a good place for gyros and fries in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went there on my lunch break with a co worker for the first time and the location wasn't far from work. I got a salmon salad with a side of onion rings and it was good but the wait was so long. Our lunch break was 30 mintues and it took almost half an hour for our food to be ready. We were late getting back. Now I know to call in in advance for pick up. Not thrilled about the wrong wait."}
{"text":"This place has fresh & delicious food. I did a take out order and waited 15 minutes but there was 5 orders ahead of me. The foodwas very hot and awesome . I will be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"So I visited this palace last night. My friends have all recommended this place so I was certainly excited to see what the fuss was all about. It's a very hole in the wall place, but in my experience those are the places that have the best food. Not to judge a book by its cover, I ordered the chicken supreme. It has a vast menu but as I don't eat lamb, I couldn't order the Gyro. The food was great as a whole. My one disappointment was that the meat was not tender. It tasted closer to \"Chipotle\" chicken than what one would expect from a spit roasted authentic shawarma joint. Ill come back again probably, but order something different."}
{"text":"Excellent chili probably one of the best gyros I've ever had... The staff is amazing friendly and helpful and I love that they have a digital display of pictures of their menu up on the wall so you can actually see what the food looks like before you order it. This was our first time but we will definitely be back, probably tomorrow"}
{"text":"Here for the first time letting Yelpers be my guide.  Wanted Greek spinach pie in the worst way as I hadn't eaten it in a LONG time.  George's is a simple store front restaurant where the menu is literally on the wall for all to see.  If you have questions you can go to the cashier/server.  We didn't know that she doesn't come to the table to take your order. So we kind of sat around staring at the menu/wall.  Then we had questions and went up to the lovely Katy, the young lady at the counter.  I say lovely because she was helpful and attentive and she thought we were a blast.  Hey, anyone who likes us that much can be called \"lovely\".  And yes, she really was.    Ordered the spinach pie which only came in appetizer portion and a pork soulvaki sandwich with fries.  Hubby ordered a pasta dish with green peppers, chicken breast and a garlic sauce.  His came with a huge side salad.  Everything appeared fresh.  The appetizer portion of the spinach pie had 6 triangular pieces.  Not so small for only $4.50.  Amazing.   My pork souvlaki sandwich served on a pita had onions and tzaziki sauce.  The french fries were well done as I had asked.  Pasta dish was enjoyed by hubby so no complaints there.   My sandwich was large enough to bring half home with some of the fries along with 4 pieces of the spinach pie.  What I am trying to say is that this place gives you portions.  No skimping here.   My only issue with my sandwich was that the pork had too much garlic and oregano.  Hubby thinks there is no such thing as too much oregano but you Yelpers out there know that too much of anything, especially oregano can overwhelm the food.   Hubby had no problem with the garlic and oregano in his dish as he found it to be dee-lish. Then again, it could be just me--everyone doesn't have the same palate.    So here you have it.  A simple greek place that doesn't take your order but smilingly brings it to your table and gives you great portions for very few \"drachmas\"   George's provides a good value in a clean and friendly environment.  All you Yelpers couldn't be wrong.  Thanks for the lead."}
{"text":"Best Gyros in town hands down. Nothing fancy just good food. Don't compare to the one on Country Club different owner."}
{"text":"This was, without a doubt, the best gyro I've ever had.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  I had the original and will probably have it again until I decide to be adventurous and try one of the many other combinations.    I had a good chat with George while my gyro was being prepared and appreciated him taking time to talk because my gyro was ready before I knew it.  It was just an all around good experience."}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had. Tons of meat! Ask for extra \"tzatziki\" (sp?) sauce. Side Salad is fresh too."}
{"text":"Good food, great Gyros, and pastas, not so good with the French Fry's.... order the salad....."}
{"text":"The guy that took my order was super nice. My plate is full. I ordered the original gyro with frys  and it tastes soo  good!! Waited 6 min for the food."}
{"text":"notes to self: Great deal. Super cheap with huge portions. definitely not health food, but it is tasty. The gyro picado has grilled peppers; the Texas gyro has bbq sauce. I'm curious about the Athenian stir fry...why are there no pictures of that  Maybe it's obvious but it may be faster to order a salad than fries"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I had a gyro sandwich that came piled high with lamb. So much so that the next time I go back I'll order an extra pita for the overflow. There is no such thing as too much and I'll never say it was, but adding an extra pita will greatly enhance your eating experience. Along with the gyro I had some of their tasty, crispy french fries which I'll ask them to add a portion of to my next sandwich, an Israeli delicacy that I very much enjoy. Though I took the food to go, the atmosphere of the restaurant reminded me of something you'd find in New York, lots of Greek art and maps plus a mediocre movie on television. If you go be sure to check in! You'll take home a free drink. A+ on this place, I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review.  George's gyros continues to surprise me and treat me well. This is why I will keep coming back to this place for years to come.   Today tried the new special. Wild mushroom capellini. Holy smokes was it good. Be advised you get a side salad and a piece of bread. It's a lot of food. But sooooo good.   Had some baklava after. And the owner even came by to say hello and bring it. This place is simply a gem. I might start coming two times a week."}
{"text":"I stopped by after reading some Yelp reviews. The place is not big but most of the tables were full of people when I arrived. The gyro sandwich was very tasty and hardy. The side salad was a meal in itself. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"gyros, gyros, gyros... but I love the hot dogs the best. wait! no the deep fried mac n cheese. yeah that is it. That is my favorite and they work with the Belly app!"}
{"text":"Went with the supreme gyro with garlic fries. The gyro was was huge and on point. Garlic fries were good but a little soggy and I'll take the blame for that since I got them to go which is almost impossible to keep fries crisp let alone garlic fries in an enclosed container. Very diverse menu though which makes me want to go back and try other things."}
{"text":"Consistently Good as I've been coming here for years.  I generally stay away from fries and rice as sides and opt for the plentiful greek salad when ordering the original gyro.  Large portions, fair prices and personable employees make this place a winner.  Simple, no frills dining area, order at the counter.  They do a huge takeout business so be patient.  Desserts are excellent here in the Baklava and Bread Pudding!  Nothing but love for George's, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here today.  Got the classic gyro, which comes with fries or a side salad, and a drink.  I think in total it was about 9 bucks.  The gyro was great...tender, juicy meat.  The fries were pretty good as well...sprinkled with salt and pepper and pretty crunchy.  It's always the best to put the fries in the gyro...adds another dimension to it.    I only had two complaints about my lunch.  The pita was a bit soggy, but nothing major...almost just a little too moist and chewy for me.  Also, it took a little while for the food to come out.  I was on my lunch break and a little strapped for time and was hoping it would be a quick lunch.  The place was packed though...so by no means am I holding it against them.  All in all a pretty tasty spot.  The menu was pretty extensive with different types of gyros and shawarmas.  They had burgers as well.  Definitely looking forward to going back for another lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We eat here at least 2 times a week and the food is always on point and Katie always has a smile on her cute face! Zee is an awesome chef and owner and it's always clean inside. Customer service is amazing! I can't complain about one thing ! Love love love!"}
{"text":"Everyone kept raving about the Greek salad so I ordered it for an entree and I wasn't a fan. Then again I don't really care for iceberg lettuce, if they used some other type I would like it a lot more. I had a bite of the gyro and I was definitely tasty and there was plenty of meat. If I am ever in the area and I wanted a gyro I would go here for it. I do wish they put more sauce in the gyro but o well. My sister got the gyro with a side salad and the side salad was a greek salad which was still pretty big for a side. I have had better gyros in California though."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have to agree with the lone dissenters on here - this place is not that great. At all. The standard gyro is bland, with little sauce, little tomato, and no lettuce. The fries were soggy and lukewarm.   This is the best gyro around? That's pretty sad. Where I came from in Ohio, pretty much any place is better than this.   And it's overpriced too. $8+tax for just a gyro and fries.  AZ obviously has no idea how to do gyros right. That's too bad."}
{"text":"It's hard to say which is better.  The food or the service.  I'll start with the service since that is the first thing you notice when you walk into the restaurant.  The lady who was at the counter when we arrived was wonderfully pleasant and very understanding of first timers and all their questions.  She was great with our 10 year old daughter and helped her get a meal she would be happy with eating.  The dining area is about 10 tables big so we got to watch everything while we ate. The staff as seem as wonderful as the lady at the counter, filling in with the same genuine care when she was away from the counter.   The food.   Everything we had was amazing.  The chicken and wild spinach over rice with mushrooms was absolutely fantastic.  The chicken parmigiana and my daughters pita pizza were equally good.  The flavors were rich and the freshness was great.   We will be coming here again."}
{"text":"George's has the best gyro meat! It has so much flavor and is very moist. I've had it in a original gyro as well as a daily special called a 'greeksteak' [I believe] that is basically a cheesesteak with gyro meat. Both are awesome! I still need to try the italian style with marinara and mozzerella. The portions are extremely generous, I usually have leftovers unless I am super hungry.  I also really enjoyed the hummus. They serve it with warm pitas, which is a great touch that sets them apart from a lot of other places. Also, the greek salad that you can sub for the fries is fantastic! I'm not a fan of fries with a gyro, too much starch, so it is nice to have another option.  They have a rewards program called Belly. Each time you eat there you scan your card and get 5 points. You can save your points and redeem for different rewards, like a free drink, free meal, or even creating and having a gyro named after you on the menu!"}
{"text":"I used to go here when I was at ASU. Best Gyro I've ever had. The owner is incredibly nice, super glad to see how high the reviews are- they earned it!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Everything I've ordered since discovering this place has been uber yummy. Katey and Tyler (cashiers/servers) are always kind, friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant where you can quick bite to eat hassle free. The wait for food is less than 10 minutes. The inside could be a little nicer but it's not bad. Obviously the food is amazing"}
{"text":"George's is the real deal. I eat here at least 3 times a month and we just recently had them cater our wedding. The gyros and chicken pitas are fantastic, and like another person mentioned, the tzatsiki sauce is unmatched anywhere in the valley. I've had their falafel, dolmades, hummus and pita, and the fried mushrooms and I would reccomend all of those.  The atmosphere at the restaurant is very friendly and it isn't uncommon to strike up conversations with complete strangers. The price is right and I'll definitely be eating there many more times in the future."}
{"text":"The fries were amazing! We got a gyro  to go but ended up eating it in the car. The staff was friendly, clean bathrooms. The menu is pretty extensive with lots of great choices. Il be back!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer. This is my go to crowd pleaser local restaurant.  I love the Giro salad"}
{"text":"On the way back to the Phoenix airport, George's Gyro's came up on my Yelp.  Willing to give this place a chance! We did have a plane to catch, so we were a bit rushed; service is a tad slow.  Full menu of gyro's falafels, hummus plates, salads, burgers, Chicago hot dogs, pasta dishes (seems unusual for a Greek place) and more.  I had the falafel pita and the Greek salad; pita was fresh, falafels were home made and delicious.  the Greek salad was tasty, greens, dressing, olives, feta, etc.  soooo good. Husband had the chicken sandwich, it had a nice charbroiled flavor and a good marinade, very good.  Sis had the hummus, very tasty, too bad we had no room for dessert!  Place is clean and friendly, service was a bit slip b manageable."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from George's! Excellent food and service every time. I am a meatball sandwich critic and I would say they have one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with George's when I first walked in, it's an older building and the location isn't impressive, but after trying their gyro supreme I can't go anywhere else! This was the best gyro I've ever had. They seem very authentic and their chicken gyro is amazing too. I don't know what they do to their meat to make it so much better than other greek places but it is unreal. Their appetizers are good/average but their gyros make this my go-to place for greek food."}
{"text":"This place has the softest pita bread! The chicken pita is delicious and the tzatziki sauce is so good. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with some work friends. Ordered the gyro patter. Took a long time to get the meal which on a lunch hour can be a problem. The food was like it says on their windows \"The best in Arizona \". The gyro meat was awesome, the fries,salad and pita bread all perfect. Can't wait to go back bur Wil order lunch ahead of time."}
{"text":"One of those times you wish the place was closer to home. Good food, made quickly, basic inside the restaurant, but I don't care as long as food is good. Had a gyro and fries, 10/10 would be back."}
{"text":"As a first timer, the food was good and the customer service was great!! On a side note, there was no ice in the soda machine.. And they were out of their baklava before 2pm. . Which seems odd. Either way, good food!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because I had a craving for gryo. Was tempted to go to Haji baba down the street but decided to try something new. Called ahead and ordered the original gyro with fries and was ready to go by the time I got here. Have to say I wasn't dissappointed. The portion was huge with gyro meat piled high atop a lowly peice of pita bread. I had to take off meat and put it aside just so i could take a bite! Not a bad problem to have.. definetly a first world problem! The fries werent bad either for not being McDs. The gyro meat was well seasoned--a little greasy but who cares.. still delicious! I'll have to order a side of Tzatziki next time since the meat to tzatziki ratio was out of whack! I'll definetly put this on my list of places to eat when I'm absolutely starving!  Tip: Dont forget to check in through Yelp. I got a free drink out of it!"}
{"text":"Finally got to visit !  Portions are huge ! Be prepared to eat ! Lots of meat for the prices . Service was fast friendly and nice . We will be back !   Very clean restaurant !"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today, YAY. Falafel burger was GREAT and loved the pickle fries. Looking forward to coming back for the jalapeno mac and cheese bites."}
{"text":"We love this place. Truth:: my husband and I go here at least twice a month if not more. Ekkkkkkk. Katie is a sweetheart and always on top of our orders. Food rocks. Service excellent. Quality and great portions for the price. GO HERE PEOPLE. SO WORTH IT. xx Beatty fam"}
{"text":"I just moved to the Phoenix area. In all the various cities I've lived in a don't recall ever having a gyro filled with so much delicious meat. It was awesome. Plus the salad was good and a good portion. For 8 dollars, I have a great meal. 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Not impressed. If you have another Gyros place closer to you. Just go there. I went a little bit more out of the way because of the reviews. Not worth it. Order the Gyros Supreme togo because of the review. Waited 20 minutes. Nothing supreme about it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Sadly, I haven't tried that many dishes because every time I go in, I HAVE to get the gyro and the greek salad. I hope one day to be able to broaden my palate and report on their other dishes.   The gyro is good - YES as another reviewer stated, it's greasy. That's why it's yummy. Skip the fries, they are nothing special compared to the other two sides available. The white rice with tomato sauce is awfully tasty but the greek salad is my favorite and it's what I get every time now. Nice fresh lettuce and a variety of veggies! I'm so picky about that.  Disappointment: One day while the cook rang me up for my gyro plate (Feeds 2 for under $10, you can't beat it) he was telling me how great his baklava is. So when I went to a dinner party the next week I stopped in and bought some to bring for dessert. Sadly, the baklava was not to my personal liking. It was chock-full of nuts as he described but there was not enough phyllo dough or especially HONEY for my tastes. Rather dry and nutty, not sweet enough for me. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Damn, I love this place.  Best gyro I've ever had, anywhere.  Everyone that works here is friendly.  You'll leave here stuffed for under $10.  What more to say?  If you haven't been, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Best gyros, fries, and Greek salad. Always the first place I recommend to anyone wanting Mediterranean."}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe how fantastic everything is at George's Famous Gyros. First of all, the cashier/waitress is curtious, sweet, engaging, polite, and so adorable. She was incredible with all the customers, even when slammed with customers and phone calls, and not only did she handle everything like it was nothing, she was concise, specific, and incredibly calm. She would be the reason to return alone.   Yet, there was amazing food as well. The dolmades were so fresh, you could taste the grape leaves and hint of lemon juice just melt on your tongue. The Tzatziki sauce was creamy, smooth, velvety deliciousness and just a dip into that sauce made you feel like you were on the Ocean in Greece. But wait...you must have the flaky, light, spinachy cheesy Spanakopita. It's golden brown filo dough handles the wildly original marinara dipping sauce with feta that is a mind explosion of flavors. And to cap my meal, I had to devour the delicate and slightly sweetened pistachio almond Baklava.  As I looked up when finishing this review, the store was slammed again with more customers who were digging into the Gyros and Pitas. Everything looks and smells so good you will want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"So I went here on two separate visits and on each visit I tried something different. On the first visit I tried the platter which I thought was good overall with the exception of the Greek salad which I mostly skipped over. On the second visit I tried the chicken pita w/ fries and thought that was just okay. The chicken seemed a bit too dry and lacked flavor for me. I will probably have to try something else from this place as I have mixed thoughts about their food at the moment...  The customer service here is good. There is a lady at the front who seems to take good care of her regular customers. It was nice and refreshing to see that."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! From the service to the recommendations on the menu! Katie was super polite and very confident that the food they serve was exactly what I had been looking for. She also made some nice small talk while the food I ordered to go was being prepared. The restaurant was clean and seemed like everything had a home for its self. The air temperature, the lights and music was very appropriate for the restaurant. I'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I live only a couple minutes away from this restaurant so I'm a frequent customer. The gyros are, of course, excellent, but some of their other dishes are a bit mediocre. I would not recommend the meatball sandwich, the Chicago dog or the pasta, but I would most certainly recommend the gyros! I gave this place one extra star because of the friendly and cute staff. Their service will make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast.  Purchased a gyro to go.  Checked for a free drink.  Skipped the salad and fries.  next time will ask for extra sauce.   The sandwich was very very good.  I could taste oregano and spices. Place was busy at lunch."}
{"text":"I discovered George's through my restaurant.com coupon.  My girlfriend and I ordered two original Gyros.  I had the fries and she had the salad.  We also ordered the fried mushrooms and jalopeno poppers.  The fried appetizers came out first.  And they were perfect!  We have had fried mushrooms in the past that were dripping in grease or still frozen in the middle.  These were absolutely done to perfection.  They were crispy and seasoned without leaving you feeling greasy.  The gyros and fries were also well done.  The portions were generous for the price.  This is my new Gyro spot for sure."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant for over a year.  I refuse to eat there any longer!!  It's never the food that is an issue.  It is good and yummy....if you ever can get it under 1/2 hour.  We thought we were smart and figured that if we called ahead, we could cut down the wait.  Well, that  didn't work either.  After waiting 40 mins today, we found out they gave our lunch to someone else and couldn't remake it until they got a delivery in.    We know you have to wait for good fresh food but REALLY!!  This takes the cake!!  We're done.  Hopefully, he'll figure out how to fix his restaurant.  He recently spruced up the decor but that never was the problem.  Too bad!!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! I got the gyro supreme and my mom got the regular gyro. It was delicious! Good pricing. Make sure to check in on Yelp for a FREE drink!   It was chocked full of savory lamb meat, and the fries were freshly made! The man even checked to make sure our food was good.   We liked eating outside. I included a picture."}
{"text":"Great food and good value and friendly staff, the girl that was running the front was on the ball. I could make two meals out of my order of chicken pita with 1/2 salad / 1/2 fries.  This location gets busy during peak times but worth the wait but know what your in for...If you're in a rush you might want to order ahead..hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Let me just say: WOW!!! How have I only just now been to this place? If you love Greek food, look no further.  We stopped in today for a quick bite to eat and were not disappointed. You know how I love lists, so here is a list of the things that we loved about this place: 1. Easily the best gyro meat we have ever had. Flavorful. Tender. The ideal texture. Just. Muah! *kissing motion* 2. The fries/salad were also awesome. Taaaaasty sides. 3. Generous portions. Holy cow, the gyros were gyro-normous! I almost had to use a fork! 4. The tzaztiki (I am butchering the spelling of that word) is out of this world. It, like the meat, has incredible flavor and texture-- not too much dill flavor/very creamy/not too thin. I'll take a bucket to-go, please. 5. There are  red and green bell peppers on the Gyro Supreme. YUM!  6. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. The prices at the place are ridiculous (in a good way), considering the caliber of the food you receive. We paid less than $20 for two of us. Can't go wrong with prices like that. 7. Family owned/local business. We were able to meet the owner (George). Loved that! 8. The decor. This tiny little hole in the wall place has really adorable styling inside.  9. Free drink when you check in on Yelp. 10. Only 5 minutes from the house.  All in all, this discovery was a complete win. While we were there, Rob (the boyfriend) actually used the word \"out-%$@king-standing!\". Seriously. That good.  We will be back ASAP! Thank you, George!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind. Friendly staff and spectacular food. My son eats here at least once a week, and we (the rest of the family) eat here quite often as we'll. I highly recommend this to family and friends and to all of you"}
{"text":"It's a blessing that this wonderful place is so close to my home!  Location: the location is nothing special. It is a whole in the wall, but I'm glad I tried it. The restaurant itself is small and not much to marvel at, until your food comes out!!  Food: lord help me this food is so good I could eat it everyday! The servings at George's are enormous (I can generally share it with someone)! I can always tell an affordable and hearty meal awaits when I see mainly men who do physical labor come in, one right after another. My meal however was even more hearty and delicious then I ever would have imagined! The amount of meat on my gyro was enough for two separate gyros at other Greek restaurants. Beyond that their fry's are amazing, (I'm really picky about frys) the Greek salad is a generous portion, and their baklava is to die for!  Service: I can't tell which is better, the service or the food. They have probably one of the sweetest humans as the cashier. This girl (I will have to get her name next time) says hello to all the regulars by name and genuinely asks them how their families are and so on. I'm by no means am a regular YET, but she always is so kind and welcoming. Even though it's obvious she doesn't have to, she always brings out our food and makes sure we don't need anything else. often times she will even pick up our plates for us. Mind you this isn't a sit down restaurant.   Tips: leave a tip!! This place is great and so is the staff!"}
{"text":"The BEST Greek food in town!!! My favorite is a gyro and fries!"}
{"text":"Very good gyros with excellent service. Even their burgers are good. This place doesn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5.  The food is good, but the gyro and cheesesteak my husband and I shared were a bit on the greasy side.  Although that is to be somewhat expected with gyro's and cheesesteaks, I feel like they were greasier than gyros and cheesesteaks ought to be.   However, I would not recommend their desserts.  The service was also good.  The reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars is because it didn't really stand out in comparison to other places like the Phoenician (not during the summers), but it was definitely better compared to places like Oliveo.    I think I will need to give this place another try, however.  I will update as soon as I do."}
{"text":"Its my first time going here with my beau. And the gyro with the side of salad is amazing! I wasn't able to finish the whole thing tho, but I brought home the left over for lunch the next day. And maaaan! Its amazing as it was yesterday. Definitely a recommend for out of towners."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, I can't believe I never wrote a review.  Their gyro sandwiches are solid.  They really stuff the sandwich and its nice because its not super greasy.  I've had their steak sandwich too - its weird how they package it kind of like an open faced sandwich, but it's decent.  It's chopped bite sized pieces of sirloin.  They season it pretty well but its a tiny bit tougher than I like.  The fries are decent though I like them crispier.  Everything tastes pretty fresh.  I kind of prefer the greek salad which they do a great job with, and you get a lot.    The baklava is also a wonderful addition to your meal.  I wouldn't get the chicago hot dog or anything, but other items are priced well so you get a pretty good value for your money.  The food is freshly made, seasoned well, and portioned nicely.  The wait is a bit long if you don't phone in your order ahead of time but this place is definitely a try if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Better then any greek food that I have had in Phoenix.  I don't say that a lot.  Will most definitely be back.  One critical thing is on me.  Next time fries extra crispy.  I was mischarged though according to the online menu.  (6.95 + 6.45) *.09= $14.60 not $15.14.  Oh well.  Great food."}
{"text":"Mandatory stop every time I'm in Scottsdale! The food is amazing and service is prestigious. They treat me like a king and feed me a feast! Only come here if you want the best gyro of your life!"}
{"text":"Really good Gyros! Very fresh and good. Really clean inside too. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff! Two thumbs up from a Greek!"}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews, I was excited to try out George's with my husband. We normally go to Pita Shack in Tempe when we are looking for a good Gyro but we were on the north side of town and wanted to grab a quick dinner. Looked up some options on Yelp which is what led us to Georges. My husband ordered the Gyro with jalapeños, onions and peppers and I ordered the traditional Gyro with a side salad. We also ordered some Spanakopita and 2 drinks. Honestly the best thing about the meal was the side greek salad. Gyro meat was cold... which was kind of a bummer as we waited just about 15 minutes for the two pitas to come out. What really irked me was after we had checked out and were waiting for our food, a group of guys walked in and the girl asked if it was their first time in and since it was, offered up complimentary drinks. It wasn't like they were busy when we came in, she was just very short and didn't feel like engaging with us. Maybe an off night for the staff and food, but I wouldn't be inclined to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! We've tried George's for the first time 2 weeks ago and have been back 5 times since. Staff is very sweet, friendly and treat you like family. Every item we have tried on the menu is scrumptious, fresh and cooked to order.  We will definitely continue to support our new favorite local business!"}
{"text":"Oh man, what can I say??? YOU MUST go here!!! The food was delish and awesome servings. Customer service could be a little better. I got the gyro salad and it was amazing, very filling. The gyro was also very good. If you're in the area, stop by, you won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Living in S. Scottsdale, I had never heard of George's Famous Gyros.  When a friend suggested Greek food, I remembered there was a new place in the Papago Center on the corner of McDowell and Scottsdale Road.  Well, come to find out that place is also called George's Gyros (without the famous.)  Sounded shady to me and seems like that place is trying to steal business from the original.  So, we took the extra few minutes to make sure to google and get the right place.     It was my 1st time eating lamb as guilt always took precedence over the deliciousness of a baby animal.  But, when my friend insisted that we order take out I finally gave in. I ordered a Greek salad (instead of fries) along with a kabob and just in case I didn't like lamb, a side of (cant remember name) rice rolled in a grape leaf.   We placed our order over the phone and after 20 minutes we went and picked it up.  It was ready and hot.  George told us there was only about 20% lamb and the rest was beef.  The whole meal was delicious.  There was plenty of leftovers for a 2nd meal.  I will definitely be back to George's FAMOUS Gyros."}
{"text":"After eating here usually within 24 hours I am already craving George's Gyros again.  Georges is the best. Great customer service, great food, great prices and a great place to fill up on warm amazing food.  By far my favorite thing from here is the Gryo #1 Combo. Already cant wait to eat here again.  I used to come here with my ex alllll the time.  I miss living in the area!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in the east valley! We have been their twice now and staff is super friendly and the food is awesome. It is worth the drive to stop by here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food (gyro, salad, and fries) was awesome. The girl at the front was very nice and professional.  The owner was very nice as well as he told us about the food.   The desert (baklava) was very good   The atmosphere was good as well. No complaints about this place.  5 stars for sure"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!!!  The first time I went, i tried there Greek club pita, and was blown away!  This was the best pita I have ever had.  On my next visit I decided to try the Original Gyro, and was so surprised with how delicious it was.  You get your choice of fries or salad...Take the salad its great, the fries could be better :(  Highly Recommend going"}
{"text":"It's great tasting Greek food at a low price.  Owner is personable and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"In town for work, had a craving for a gyro. This one hit the spot. Really clean and kept up on the inside. Beautiful girl taking orders like a boss. Very friendly, anybody that calls me sweetie gets an extra star. Overall the food was really good, fries on point. Awesome tatziki sauce. Only thing reason for 4 stars was not enough tomato and onion.  Absolutely recommend and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I wish there was one in Los Angeles so I could be a regular.    I had my first meal in Scottsdale here right after getting off the plane and finding it on yelp.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, the portions are large (enough for two meals),and the food is unbelievable.  I tried the gyro plate and the chicken pita.   I can't even say which one I liked more because both were so delicious.    I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best gyros I have had outside Chicago. Definitely worth the trip. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service with hearty portions. Had the original gyro it was enough for two! Appetizers were delicious and plenty... Tried the jalapeño poppers and onion rings. Chicken supreme looked fresh and the steak and cheese was a gooey hot sandwich ."}
{"text":"Because I love the food at George's so much, or maybe because as a neighbor I feel extremely lucky to have to have such a great place so close, I often forget my favorite thing about stopping in for lunch.  My favorite thing about Georges despite all of its excellence is the service!!! The young lady that takes your orders is simply excellent at what she does, she always has been. Her welcoming smile, efficiency taking orders , and her genuine kindness combined with subtle flattery that encourages you to finish your day after your lunch break ends.  I don't know her name, but I do know that face, and I certainly appreciate the service. Try the food, it's GREAT. but relax and let someone take over for 30 minutes, It's why this place is a great spot for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Referred by a friend....this will be my new spot! Awesome quality. Quiet location...a definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"The strip mall may not look the most welcoming, but the food is great! I called them for an order and the food was ready to be picked up within 15 minutes. The staff is nice and accommodating.  I recommend the tzatziki starter!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats that taste wonderful are a very hard thing to find these days.  Last night my wife and I had a couple gyros, hummus, salad, and falafel and the price was about $20.  Walk in to this place at any time of the day, and there are people eating here.  George knows his stuff when it comes to quality and affordability and I know that next time I'm needing my greek fix, I'll be knocking at his door."}
{"text":"Gyro platter was pretty darn tasty. Definitely get with rice over fries. Dolmades seemed wilty until you discover they're just coated in olive oil. The tzadziki sauce was very dilly but overall really good. Definitely a place that will become a regular stomping grounds for me from now on."}
{"text":"If you are in a restaurant before closing time they should serve you. It's pretty much just good business and customer service. Apparently this place isn't aware of that.  My dining partner and I walked in at 7:54pm yesterday (12/18/13). The door was wide open, all the lights were on, people were inside eating, and the gyro meat was still in the rotisserie in the kitchen. No one was at the counter so we stood around deciding what to eat. Someone working there came in through the front door, so he wasn't even IN the restaurant. He immediately told us they close at 8, which it now was since we had to wait. We were turned away and walked out the door at 8:02.  We went down the street to Philly's and gave them our money since this place didn't seem to want it."}
{"text":"WAS ASKED TO TAKE MY MENTALLY DISABLED SON OUTSIDE BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE.  He was making too much noise because the chicken nuggets I ordered for him were still not ready after 30 minutes.  When I explained his situation to them,  they were not accommodating in anyway nor offered any solutions to getting the food on the table.  I asked for my money back and left.  The staff is unkind, snotty and arrogant.  They act is if they are running a five star restaurant with white table clothes and fine wine.  It's not Le Cirque, Baby and a perfectly appropriate place to take loud children.  In fact, it is a dump located in a strip mall between a massage parlor and a trailer park full of meth labs - a place where a loud disabled child should expect to be served and treated with respect."}
{"text":"This Greek restaurant is the bomb. Best I've had in Arizona! Service was friendly and fast. The food was delicious and very filling. I would highly recommend this place if you are hungry for great food."}
{"text":"Drug use must be rampant in Tempe, or perhaps, there is a direct correlation between those who are high and those who review George's Famous Gyros on Yelp.    There is absolutely nothing good about this gyro except the quantity of meat.  There is essentially a pinch of lettuce, tomato and onion.  The sauce is there, but without much taste.  I've had better food at the ball game.    I think I will quit med school and just open up a gyro shop because apparently there is no competition since no one in Tempe knows how to make a gyro.  I guess all the Greek paraphernalia is analogous to an incompetent doctor with a great bedside manner, just because you look the part doesn't mean you are going to deliver in the end."}
{"text":"We are new to town and the hotel recommended George's! Man are we glad they did! We went there twice this week! The young lady behind the counter is amazing, the Gyro supreme with 1/2 fries and half salad is the way to go! IT IS HUGE! We got the hummus appetizer both times it was so good! This place is a sure winner! Then we got the Nutella cheesecake just because! WOW! Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Love this place & love the fact that it is so close to my job!  The best Greek food I've had since moving here 4 years ago.  The gyros plate is HUGE!  All of it delicious(meat, rice, pita, side salad and lots of tzatziki sauce).  Soup - out of this world.  Mac & Cheese bites (Gouda) seem out of place with all the authentic Greek food but they were delicious.  The Falafel burger is rumored to become a permanent menu item - it deserves to be!  Delicious meat-less option served with a dinner salad (instead of fries) and I'm almost forgiven for having the mac and cheese bites!   Menu options are vast & I'm sure there is something for everyone.  So glad I followed a coworker's recommendation & dined here.  We will be back - often."}
{"text":"It's hard to totally screw up gyro meat. I've generally been pleased any time I've gotten a gyro. I went to George's Famous for the first time last week, and I was more than impressed. I got the Original and my boyfriend got the Gyro Picado, which is really spicy with all the peppers and jalapenos. Both were really good, HUGE and like I sad, the meat was great. Apparently they make a lot of their own stuff right there. The tzatziki was one of the best I've had. George suggested I get one of the other dishes that has a Vodka Alfredo sauce next time. He said it's a favorite of the regulars. I forget what dish it's supposed to come on, but I'm sure if you mentioned it, he'd know! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've tried the chicken pita w extra diced cucumbers; tried w both a Greek salad and another time with fries. Both very delicious! Best fries!  Had the pita with siracha sauce and yum, added the extra kick of flavor with every bite! Hubby had the gyro and said it was to die for!  Everything is reasonably priced! Will be back for sure and definitely recommend to everyone we know! Staff is very friendly! They take online orders, too, which is very convenient. They will text you immediately with pick-up time! Thanks for the wonderful food and great experience!"}
{"text":"This place, by far, has the best gyros I've ever had and I've tried them all over the country and in Western Europe. I'm so impressed and not surprised that this hole in the wall joint knocks it right out of the park as it should. This is no heartless chain or a lifeless spot of mickey mouse fare, this is where it's at. I don't care where you are in the valley, the state, or the region. Get over to George's without further delay!"}
{"text":"I was missing my old neighborhood in Queens (shout out to Astoria!) as I sometimes do, and found myself craving a Greek salad. Not just an ordinary Greek salad, but one piled high with fresh produce and charcoal grilled juicy chicken breast. I knew it would be a task to find one near my Old Town apartment, but one day BF had a gyro craving and off we went.   After referencing Yelp, we had narrowed it down to George's Gyros and George's Famous Gyros (I'm in front of Ray's pizza! Famous Ray's? No, just original Jerry!). We actually decided on the non-famous George's, but they were closed on Sunday so our decision was made for us. I'm so glad we ended up here, though-it was delicious!   We ordered take-out and placed our order at the counter, so we waited about 10-15 minutes which ended up being just enough time to scope out the staff (who have fun with their job which I love!) and the location (with the office door marked \"Pirate\"). We also enjoyed the soda fountain-this is a Coca Cola establishment, hooray! And they have a good syrup-to-soda-water ration which is hard to find. Now, on to the food...  BF's gyro was GINORMOUS and stuffed to the brim with tasty gyro meat. He gave me a bite (so generous!) and it melted in my mouth. He conquered half of it before saving the rest for later, which he said was just as good cold. The fries that came with it were good, but I will warn you that they gave us Hunt's ketchup packets, so make sure you have your own ketchup at hand if you are like me and have an aversion to Hunt's.   My Greek salad was even bigger than the sandwich-TONS of grilled, moist, juicy chicken on top of a *big* salad. And they accommodated my request for no peppers or olives (which, yes, I know, makes it not a \"Greek\" salad but whateva) which was really cool. There was an abundance of fresh lettuce and veggies, and it was more than enough for two meals. It came with two containers of an oil and vinegar dressing, and hit the spot JUST like my fave Astoria haunts. And it came with garlic bread! Super buttery and crispy and plain delicious.   Oh! And the kicker was that both meals came to under $20 including tip, PLUS we got two drinks for free since we checked in with Yelp. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't get to eat here as often as I'd like to but I'm always very satisfied every time I do... The young lady that was working the counter last night (Sat 1/16/16) is one of the best customer service representatives I have ever encountered. I left telling myself that I should go back & offer her a job; I logged onto Yelp today for the sole purpose of paying her a complement...."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  I have been here a lot and always find myself coming back.  Service is outstanding, prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious.    The prices are slightly lower than what you would expect for the food quantity, but when you factor in the quality, you are getting a great deal.  This is a place where you will see construction workers and office people eating and no one leaves hungry or has to order extra.     The service at this restaurant is outstanding. They work from a small counter and with the efficiency of people that know their jobs inside and out.  They know many customers by name but even if they don't know you when you come in, you will feel like they do when you leave.  They manage to do that even when very busy.    Finally the food.  Great food, great quality, great quantity.  Don't think this place is only about Greek food.  They have an extensive menu.  I have not had anything bad here.  But the best part of any time I come is asking the owner, Z, what he has special and different.  The main menu remains fairly static. However they always have something on the chalkboard. Take a few minutes and ask them what's special and different. If Z is there, which he almost always is, you will be treated to a tantalizing explanation of something new he is trying. And his passion for food is incredible. It is worth the trip just to talk to him about his food.  Again this is a great restaurant with a great owner a great staff and great food. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Fast service and the fried bread pudding was amazing. Service was awesome. Chicken Caesar pita was very tasty.   Would recommend anyone who like pitas or gyros to give this spot a shot."}
{"text":"This place is just the best.  I've had the chicken pita, gyro, spaghetti and meatballs, dolmades, and the baklava.  Everything has been really great.  The baklava is the best I've ever had and the chicken is pretty phenomenal too.  I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Super yummy! All of it. Not my absolute fave but the gyro is good and the tzatzki is delish. The workers there are hit or miss and the place is kinda run down."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area so this place is right down the road and I am SO HAPPY it is! First of all, everyone is so friendly and the young woman working up front is always so helpful especially because I have no clue what half of the menu is!   Last night my boyfriend and I tried this place for the second time. He got the gyro and I tried a falafel for the first time. Both were so good and so filling! I had leftover falafel for lunch today. My boyfriend got the side salad instead of fries with his gyro and it was a pretty large portion with just the right amount of dressing on the side! Oh, and we also got fried mushrooms - also perfect!  We'll be frequent flyers of this place. There's definitely quite a bit on the menu I want to try!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this hidden gem. Try the chicken fettuccine or the pesto pasta with gyro meat. Big portions and the salad and bread stick is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I was thinking that a Gyro sounded good for lunch today on my morning commute. I was running my errands at lunch time and happened to drive by George's Gyros.  I decided to check it out. The young gal at the counter was very nice and took my order. I watched as meals were delivered and the portions were huge compared to ther Gyro places in the valley. I order the \"Original\" Gyro and not only was it a lot of food, but it was very tasty! I'm adding this to my list of places to grab a Gyro! Also, the menu is very extensive. I highly recommend you go and check it out!"}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path - when you NEED a gyro and are in south Scottsdale - this is the only place to go.  Portion size is huge - the greek salad is always super fresh. I have recommended this place for years! Conveniently located south of the Disc Golf course - I find I am here a little more often than I care to admit :)"}
{"text":"The food at this place is AMAZING ! I had the chicken pita w/salad and my boyfriend got the gyro w/salad. Everything was so fresh and the dressing is delicious ! My favorite thing we ordered were probably the dolmades. It's so hard to find good ones in Phoenix and these were perfect ! The baklava was also amazing. I would highly recommend everything we ordered"}
{"text":"What is there to say? It's a greasy little hole-in-the-wall dive that serves up great, hot Greek food at reasonable prices. Not sure I'd take a date here, but for a quick, inexpensive, decent lunch this place rocks."}
{"text":"If you are anything like me, you always go for a meal that you don't get anywhere else.  The specials are always amazing with the perfect mix of flavors.  I have never tasted anything here that I didn't love.  To top things off, you will never order from nicer people anywhere you go.  The people here at George's are the friendliest and most BA that you will ever meet"}
{"text":"Consistently great! I have been to George's 7 or 8 times now and they have never let me down. The owner/cook is wonderful; he is a friendly and gracious host. The food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"A no non-sense eatery...you get your Greek on and feel great afterwards.  My usual is the traditional, nothing special but always delicious.  I almost always get things to go as the place is normally sweltering hot, decorated with crazy random and old posters of the Mediterranean, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Had the original gyro with side salad. WoW a lot of meat.  -Fast and friendly service  -Great change from regular lunch options. -Clean establishment. - Actually had a employee come outside and ask if everything was good. Did not expect that a small lunch spot."}
{"text":"Good food, great portion and excellent service. It is so goos that it could be hard to find a seat during lunch hours, but it is the proof that I am not telling the lie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for greek food, I like a little mor upscale but I havebno complaints about GEORGE'S."}
{"text":"George's is by far the best place for a Gyro in phx! The food is always great as well as the service. My favorites include the Picado and the Texas. Another reason I love this place is George himself is almost always there to great you with a smile."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! The food is great, the atmosphere is great, and the lady that is always working the front desk is always super sweet.  She goes above and beyond every time. I order the chicken gyro with fries every time and it never gets old!"}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and the food is great. I cannot talk much about the menu because I always order the salmon salad : ) Huge portion, very tasty, fresh ingredients. I just need to visit here more often."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh and quick.  Always a tasty stop after a round of disc golf at Vista del Camino park."}
{"text":"We recently tried George's and could not be more impressed! Amazing food and huge portions. We have lived in the area for a long time and regret not trying it sooner.  We have been there several times over the past few months and everything we have tried has been good. Our favorites are the gyro's (of course), the pesto pasta and their Greek fries! The staff working the front are always friendly and  the food comes out fairly quick.  Only downfall would be that it is pretty normal that they are out of something on their menu but we never care because they are also always packed so we considerate it a good sign about their popularity.  Definitely recommend if you love a local low-key place with delicious food."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick bite or some awesome take out.  Every gyro is delish and the folks there are great."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty sums it up! Love em!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while and the food is always great. Best gyros in tempe. If you haven't tried this place you must come, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't correct me on how to say gyro.....you got a hard on for how it's pronounced you loose me as a customer."}
{"text":"Best gyro in AZ! Doesn't look like much of a place, but once you get a taste of the gyro meat you will understand why I am a fan."}
{"text":"Whoa... the gyros are filled with lots of meat.  In fact, I wish they put less meat and more veggies (e.g. - onions, tomatoes).  The good thing is you can get your gyros with a salad or fries.  I always get it with the salad to add some vegetables to my diet.  The salad is a greek salad with a variety of vegetables, not your typical iceburg lettuce salad.  I wish the gyros meat was a little crispier.  Lots of meat as stated above and  the pita bread is warmed so it's nice and tender.  I always get a little extra tzaziki sauce because there is so much meat.  Best to call ahead if you're in  rush.  Considering it's about 5-7 minutes from downtown Scottsdale, it's a nice alternative to eating there.  Also the prices are great, but the location makes you think you got lost."}
{"text":"Place has consistently great food everything from there the state to their euro to the chicken salad is perfect highly recommend it and the service is great"}
{"text":"The place was incredibly busy and it took probably 20-30 minutes to get my food, but once I got it I could see why they're so popular. Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"A pretty filling and tasty gyro spot, but oooooh-wee, that wait time was a killer. I'd have understood if the place seemed busy, but it wasn't. One gyro with a side salad = half hour wait.   The pros: The gyro is enormous. Very generous portions. The prices aren't bad either, and the cashier threw in a free drink for good measure. Probably one of the better gyros I've had in the valley.  The con: The wait time. I mentioned this already, and hopefully it was a fluke, because I do intend to eat her more."}
{"text":"I think I went to the other one on Country Club Road and I loved it. So I tried this one that's way closer to my place and I loved it as well. I don't eat too much Mediterranean food, but I thought this was good. Basically for $8, I got really good portions of meat in my gyro supreme and french fries. And with the Yelp check in, you get a free drink. So I loved it. The flavor was light and not too overbearing. I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood. And this place was pretty full during lunch time on a Saturday. So that may say that it's a pretty decent place to a lot of people. :)"}
{"text":"I was in here today for a late lunch.  The strip shopping center where this restaurant is located is a little sketchy but the restaurant itself is neat as a pin.  They have a large menu and I went with the Gyro Supreme.  This baby is huge and loaded with a lot of great tasting gyro meat.  I also went with the salad instead of the fries and liked the dressing, feta and olives that were on the salad.  They have a soda fountain for soft drinks as well as iced tea and lemonade.  Check in on Yelp to get a free drink!  Service was very friendly and I'll definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and not in the mood for a burger or taco.  I just happemed upon George's by wandering that area.  All I can say to not repeat prior posts is for a casual place, you get more than you money's worth in both quality and quality.  If the same food were served at twice the price in a more upscale setting, I would say it is less exciting.  But my expectations were exceeded.  My only criticism: the hummus is visually appealing and has excellent texture, but could stand more flavor, maybe a liitle touch of garlic."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick place to eat and i LOVE gyros.  So this little hideaway on McKellips between Scottsdale and Hayden was buzzing with customers.  (Fireman anyone?)  My supreme gyro was FULL of thinly sliced beef and loaded with vegies.  The bottom of the pita had lots of feta which I love.  The tzatziki sauce was also flavorful and gave it just the right amount of moisture and taste."}
{"text":"Food is super good. Service is friendly and fast. The restaurant is clean. We went to the carniceria next store while waiting for our food and it was ready when we got back. We got the chicken pesto pasta, dolmades, and hummus and pitas; all were great!"}
{"text":"This is sooo great! I got the Italian beef phily cheesesteak style, which is from the secret menu! My hubby got chicken ceasar pita both meals complete with your choice of a side salad or fries. Very affordable and large portion sizes!"}
{"text":"My favorite gyro spot in az!! I love love love their food. The staff is friendly and the food is of good quality. I always come to George's if I want a gyro. No other place can compare to George's. Trust me. I've tried many."}
{"text":"The food at this clean little strip mall cave is straightforward and you really cannot do any better if you're looking for Greek-American food. A big part of their consistently good food is the constant presence of the owner."}
{"text":"Great food and big portions ! I had chicken gyro and my partner had  The lamb one   We could not finish it  We ate salads before the sandwiches that  Were good too.  Great service  Place was very clean   We took dessert home I had the bread pudding  and my partner had the  Baklava.   Both were delicious! We highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Not much reminds me of Home more than a gyro. George's nails it!  The staff is friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is casual. The the food will make you come back! The gyro is cooked and cut perfectly off the cone!  The pitas cooked just right and the sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Their is another store with the same name in scottsdale but trust me this place is way better than the other one in scottsdale.  These people are Greek and the other store is a bunch of mexicans working their not Greek.  Don't be fooled go to this one!"}
{"text":"Gyros are ok, large portions. Mika's Greek is definitely better. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is so good it just melts in your mouth!! Never had one bad food item from here!! And when calling int too do a pickup order they always get it right!!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Portland for the summer and became quickly addicted to street meat in downtown. When I got back to AZ I had to find the closet Gyros spot so I could feed the addiction. Luckily for me I live very close to George's and he honestly makes one of the best gyros I've ever had.   Their greek salad/gyro combo is an awesome lunch, definitely hits the spot. And he'll give you a free drink every now and then if you don't order it. Nothing better than a gyro and iced tea on a hot phoenix day. I cannot get enough of this place! I looked it up online and George is only 27 and owns/runs this restaurant. That makes me want to come back and support his efforts often. Good for him! The rest of the staff are all very friendly and do a great job at keeping the service fast and quality!"}
{"text":"I'd give it five stars if they got serious with their rice. Who puts marinara sauce on basmati rice? This is the one thing that stops me from eating here on a nightly basis. I reside like 50 feet away and will drive to a place that uses rice seasoning rather than pasta seasoning.  The Chicago Dog is pretty solid. The chicken Caesar Wrap is the cats pajamas just make sure you get a side salad or fries rather than rice."}
{"text":"Great, cheap, and just a plain knock-out lunch spot."}
{"text":"Amazing, great, tons of food for a awesome price!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing .... and the gal (I don't know her name ) she works the counter .. she could not be more friendly and welcoming .... what a gem of a place ."}
{"text":"George's Famous Gyros - this place is a bit off the beaten path but is worth it. Not that its out of the way, just kind of tucked away. I have tried many dishes here and many dishes were delicious. I always come running back to the Chicken Pita, loaded with grilled to order chicken, some other shit, a bunch of other delicious stuff too. I think theres onions and some tomato, maybe lettuce, some delicious sauce? I add french fries instead of salad cause I care about myself and my mental happiness a lot. Side of ranch, bottle of squirt, and some franks red hot slathered atop the heaping mound of tastebud tingling delight and I'm happy for at least 24 hours. Never got the shits from here either, which is super nice. Not that I usually get the shits..."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had in my life, and I've tried finding contenders. The rest of the menu would also leave you hard pressed to find something you weren't happy with. To top it off the owners are great guys and big supporters of first responders, military and the community."}
{"text":"Don't let the location scare you, both the food and the folks were  fantastic! Hadn't been here before, and when I asked what was good, Katy at the counter suggested I had to first try the Gyro before moving on to something else, so I ordered the Gyro supreme...AWESOME taste, sauce, everything! What also impressed me was the warm banter that went on between Katy and the patrons that came and went, it was like every customer was family, giving me the feeling I was back in Bay Ridge. Ate the food so fast I forgot to take pics, sorry!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a craving for gyros and I'm in the mood to just pig out at home, I head to George's Gyros for takeout.  I've never eaten there so I can't comment on service but the takeout food has not disappointed.  The Gyros Picado platter is gyro meat piled with grilled jalapenos, peppers, onion, choice of rice or fries (my choice is rice), and a feta salad.  There's tons of food, it's really spicy with all the grilled veggies, and the feta salad is FABULOUS.  So good in fact that I ask for an extra side of it ~ and at $1.50 it's a great deal!    The tsaziki sauce (spelling?)  is really good too & I love smearing it on my bread before piling on the goodness.  They usually give me about 3-4 containers of it if iI ask nicely.   It's 'divey' but,  the food's good so give it a try.  I'm looking forward to trying all the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I went for lunch today and had a gyro with the greek salad, and it was legen....wait for it....dary. It's also super affordable and speedy. If you're in the area, you've got to try it!"}
{"text":"I will never stop coming here; honestly the best gyro I've ever had. You get so much food for your money. Gyros also come with your choice of fries or a salad. The salad isn't wimpy either; it's like a full on Greek salad with peppers, olives, and feta. This place should be featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Love it."}
{"text":"Sometimes, random yelping leads to great things. Other times, not so much.  This was one of those other times, unfortunately. I wanted to love this place. It rocks the divey-tucked-in-a-strip-mall ambiance that often signals hidden gems. But, to be perfectly honest, the food was average.   We started out with dolmades, which were crafted very neatly. The texture didn't tend toward slimy, like sometimes happens when they are done incorrectly. I had the souvlaki gyro sandwich with a Greek salad. The pita was so stuffed that I ended up eating it with a fork. The pork was still moist, but it could have been more flavorful. The salad was meh as well, but I'm fairly picky about my greens.  However, I will say that service was incredibly friendly. I might give George's another go and order something else based on this alone."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. I take friends and family here and everyone raves about it. The platters are a TON of food, and it's a two-meal-deal for me! Don't let the hole in the wall looks scare you away... George's is the place to get a great gyro in the area. It's quickly becoming one of our favorites and it's always on our short list."}
{"text":"We did the \"after-dinner\" crowd since a lot of reviews said it was packed at lunch. Weekday dinner time it was quiet. A couple of tables and no line!   I know the strip mall screams THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. Especially with the run-down Circle K and dirty sidewalks. So that loses them a star. If you're paying rent, as a tenant you should demand some cleanliness around the place.   My friend had the gyro but since I don't eat lamb, I chose a chicken pita. With only three tables, they still brought our food to the wrong table, plus my side was wrong. The food was good, not outstanding or fabulous but it was good.   One minus star is for having a DESERT menu. Don't we already have enough desert in Arizona? When I mentioned the faux pas, I was told, ya they knew. They just didn't want to reprint menus. Wow..."}
{"text":"This is the most basic gyro I've ever had.  Its the same as every other gyro place.  Why the high ratings? I have no idea.  People leaving five stars must have never had any other \"jyro\" in their lives."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip and always liked trying need Mediterranean restaurants.   First thing I noticed it is that even though is in a  more industrial area people from the area still drives in for To Go orders.   Right when you come in you are treated by a very attentive and friendly server.  You order in the bar area and then they serve your food.   $10 for a Gyro platter that comes with a side salad. Lots of food for the price! The meat is jucy and tender, well seazoned. It comes with french fries or rice.   I also had a side of falafel ~$5. They were perftly fried, crunchy in the outside and soft in the inside.   I would love to come back.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"5 stars are not enough. George's is THE BEST!!  Whether you want the BEST Gyro in town or one of their other delicious meals, you won't be disappointed. We come here a minimum of once a week and have never been disappointed.  The food is delicious, the service is A+++ and the price is on point.  They even have several specials that are not on the menu that are a must try."}
{"text":"I used to work nearby this place and whenever a new employee would ask me where to grab a good lunch I directed them to George's knowing they wouldn't be disappointed. I've eaten about 2/3 of their menu and almost all of it was great. My favorites include The original gyro (duh!), The sausage and Peppers sandwich, dolmades, gyro pasta salad, shrimp mikanos, the chicken pita (w/ tzatziki), the veggie pita (add tzatziki) or any of their salads. George, Z and the crew are friendly and always take care of their customers.   I moved away to North County San Diego and man do I miss a good Gyro! Can't wait for my next visit home so I can rekindle my love for George's."}
{"text":"I am lucky to work across the street from George's. Picking up or eating in are fast for those in the go! Bonus: you can now order and pay on Grub Hub, so it's even faster!  Now, be prepared if you hit the lunch rush to wait.  This place is jamming during that time with all the local businesses and contractors.  I highly suggest pre-ordering!  Bummed they close at 8, but they've got lives too!   The staff is always laid back and friendly. George is.the.jam. He's super nice, hilarious and appreciates his customers.  There is always something cool on tv, be it new or from days of yore. His business also always contributes to our yearly Christmas charity for kids. Decent.  Ok, to the food. There is nothing bad on the menu. The gyros are great. The salads are great. The pizza and pastas are great. My favorites are the spanakopita and the dolmades.  Though they are appetizers, the abundance of food makes for a great finger food lunch as well! Not feeling Greek? They have American and Italian selections as well.  To the reviewer commenting on the cold dolmades, if you have been in AZ a while, you may notice that most are served this way, especially since they are not meat dolmas. I will tell you this...if you want something a certain way to which you are accustomed, just ask! The staff at George's will certainly oblige if you want your dolmades hot.  I make changes and omit ingredients all the time and they are super cool.  If you enjoy basic Greek, you must patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"The Bomb!! Greek food usually tastes the same wherever you go, but once you go here all the rest can't hold up. I don't know what it is but all their food (I've tried many items) is excellent and I eat their about every weekend. They recently upped their prices slightly but it's definitely worth it. The gyros are the best I've ever had and they jam it full of meat and toppings. Don't let the unfancy inside bother you, it is the best Greek food you can get in Arizona."}
{"text":"I grew up eating gyros (year o's). George's has some of the best seasoned gyro meat and it is consistently the same.  The chicken pita is good as well, but nothing beats the original beef gyro. The fries are fresh and the greek salads are bomb! I agree with a previous reviewer about the dressing being heavy. Just get it on the side. This has become one of my regular lunch spots. I have driven across town to get here. Not only is the food good, but the staff is friendly and make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Staff were super friendly and very welcoming when I walked in. Received my free soda upon checking in. Jalapeño Gyro is a must try and exploding with flavor. I will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Yelped it because my boyfriend and I were nearby and were craving gyros. Our verdict: Everything about this place is amazing! Super friendly service, really good salad, AMAZING Mac & Cheese Bites, and of course the famous gyros were good too! Highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"I tried them for the first time and ordered the platter.   There was enough food for dinner and lunch the next day.  It reheated great and tasted as if I had just gotten it."}
{"text":"THE absolute best Greek restaurant anywhere....did I mention I'm Greek? Literally everything in this no-frills eatery, including the non-Greek pasta dishes, put any restaurant to shame, even the \"fancy smanchy\" expensive North Scottsdale Greek and Italian eateries!  I recommend anything and everything on George's menu.  George Salvaridis is a great guy who loves to keep you laughing while enjoying his food.  His restaurant partner, Zlatko Redzic, a Le Cordon Bleu (spelling? ) graduate,  makes every dish amazing, and mixes so nicely with all of his customers. We love this place and so will you!  Andrea Koukos-Paul....a very happy customer!"}
{"text":"George's is my favorite take-out in the area. The food is consistently amazing. Katie, the cashier, brings a vibrant energy to the restaurant. She is passionate when describing menu items and puts in 110% effort consistently. While I was waiting for my food on a busy Thursday afternoon, I watched her handle what could have been a stressful lunch shift with grace. When she only had 1 minute in between answering the phone and bagging food orders, she ran over to the dining area quickly to push in chairs, wipe down the tables, and even wiped up a small ketchup spill on the floor. Her energy, passion, and drive to serve customers makes this place amazing. Thank you, Katie for making a great day even better!!"}
{"text":"Was craving a meatball sub and came here based on the reviews. Got it to go and it was out pretty quickly. It was about $7 for the sub and a side of fries. Got back to work to eat and it was still really hot and the cheese was all melty and the fries were still crispy. The only thing I'd change is that the marinara seems to be all poured on the top but not inside the bread. I like my meatball subs a little more saucy, but overall it was still good and a pretty decent price.   The girl at the front was super nice, and I didn't think the appearance is all that bad like others are saying. It's in a small strip/plaza but it's not like shady or gross outside. I was not intimidated in the least and I think inside was fine too, it's a smaller place but I'd prefer that over a big commercial chain any day."}
{"text":"Wow. Seriously. Wowwwww. Amazing food, great customer service, quiet location. Really outstanding. The restaurant won't knock you down with ambience, but it's clean, efficient, and friendly. Go to this place. Now."}
{"text":"Delicious and greatly priced! I cant decide decide on the original gyro or platter BC I love them both so much. I love getting the platter to split. The gyro meat is so on point, I always order extra pita BC the meat is overflowing making it easy to make a second gyro. The staff is super friendly, I've never had service issues and the food is always delicious and consumed quickly!"}
{"text":"If Michael Scott opened a restaurant it would be called Mikonos. This place might be better though. More than just Greek on the menu. Tastes good!"}
{"text":"This place is spectacular! Definatly recommend the Greek Spaghetti! The food is amazing and the people are awesome!"}
{"text":"Had the gyro again, couldn't help it.  After having it again it's the second best gyro I've ever had.  Gave the humus another try too, it was delicious.  Also, if you go for the gyro, don't be afraid of the salad, it's great!"}
{"text":"This is a no frills place. The eating area is small and has little character..... but you don't CARE because you are eating some of the best food around. Tucked away in the little strip mall that can best be called \"iffy\" you might wonder what am I doing here? Get past that and order the original gyro and YUMMY!!! They give you a LOT of food. The fries are always hot and plenty of them. My wife and I often split a meal for lunch. They have many many choices. The chicken pita is great too. Prices are not bad either. The only thing why they don't get the last star is they close at 8pm, and around 7pm the choices are kind of limited. But who cares, get down there early and pig out!"}
{"text":"I'm a Greek American from Chicago. Where do I start? The chewy chicken? The bland tzatziki or the fact that \"thank you\" was spelled wrong in Greek on the menus? Mediocre Greek food at best. Lots of Greeks in Chicago. I'm embarrassed to share this fact with these guys. Not to mention the customer service was lacking. I asked for extra tzatziki for my fries and got ketchup (although after tasting the tzatziki I'm glad I didn't get it)."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place has unbelievably good gyro, but I've been here literally 75 minutes waiting for 2 salads to go!  There's no acknowledgment, either, just an overworked girl trying not to get yelled at by the hordes of people she mistakenly told \"30-40 minutes\".  I saw one guy go up and get a refund after an hour, and when he left what they said was \"oh he got all mad and left.\"  Actually, he had a limited lunch break like we all do and I know he waited longer than I did! Don't forget it's a small place, and we can all hear you. We love your food, George's, but unless you fix the wait we won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best gyro in the Phoenix metro.  Awesomely fresh meat with a slight crisp on the edges.  Fast friendly service and always made fresh to order.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I met one of the owners (George) at the restaurant depot, and called today to touch base with him. Unfortunately Katie who answered the phone assumed that I was a telemarketer and hung up on me several times. Not sure why Zlatko who I also spoke too defended his employee being rude to a \"potential\" customer, but I can honestly say based on that experience, unfortunately I will find another location to eat at! It is my opinion that it is important to treat every person that calls with respect and dignity, and not assume that everyone that calls in is a telemarketer!"}
{"text":"Everything I come in I have to get the same thing Gyro and Greek salad.   A must.   Super friendly service."}
{"text":"YUM.  I came here because of a Groupon and I am glad I found it.  I've been to Greece and I'm uber snobby about crappy Greek food.  The gyro was delicous as was the greek salad.  The hummus was creamy and full of flavor.  Next time i will ask for extra tzatziki, owever."}
{"text":"Went here because of yelp reviews. Only reason 4 stars service little slow but the wait was well worth it. My husband and I got supreme gyros and were not disappointed. Good job George."}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered the gyro plate with salad and fries. I also got pickle fries. Lady was nice. I only when here because mucha lucha (taco shop next door) glad I did was closed at 4 which is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The Gyro piccata is one of the best! They always have yummy looking one special, but I can't steer from my favorite Gyro ."}
{"text":"Nice place for a lunch.  I like Greek food, and the gyro and salad combo was pretty good.  They put a lot of meat on the gyro, but not much sauce.  All in all, it's a pretty good place to some lunch.  Just go before the typically lunch hour because there will be a long line."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and its been a delight each time. Im originally from Chicago where they have phenomenal Greek food, but I've been disappointed in my search for Greek food since moving out West (San Diego and now Phoenix) . However this place is run by Greek Chicagoans and was not a let down. My wife really enjoys the pasta there, especially one time when they made their special vodka sauce pasta. I really like their gyros, the meat is superb and plenty. Unlike some other Greek places I've tried in the area, this place is not only good but reasonably priced and you get a good quantity of food. I think I will stop checking other Greek places out, wasting my money, and just go to George's :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Friday night place to grab dinner. I am looking for a new place now. George hasn't been there the last few times I was there and you can totally tell with the cleanliness and service. It is so sad. The food is still good but the service has gone so far downhill. The drink machines are so dirty I didn't use my free drink. It makes me sad. The guy who tells everyone he is the owner is kind of rude. George come back!"}
{"text":"Just tried George's and my wife an I were impressed. The food was great, and the prices reasonable.   The cashier was nice and talkative, and only as we were leaving did we realized it was the owner. Nice guy, tasty food. We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"A fantastic little locally owned dive in South Scottsdale. I can't count how many times I've driven past George's, but I never had a desire to stop in because the strip mall it's located in is pretty shady looking. But then I read all the good reviews and decided I had to check it out. I'm glad I did.   The menu (which is posted on the wall, and takes up a lot of space) is huge. In addition to the pitas, there are pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers, platters, and appetizers (both Greek and American). The very friendly girl at the counter wasn't even able to tell me what the best items were, but that's because a guy sitting just inches away started to rave about everything. I decided to go with the Original Gyro (hey, the place is call George's Famous Gyros, after all. It's $6.75 and comes with a salad or fries (I went with the salad). I also tried the Baklava since the raving customer told me it was the best he's ever had.  The Gyro was phenomenal. As good as any Gyro place I've ever eaten at. It's all from Chicago, and you can taste it! It looks small at first, but you'll be surprised at how much meat the pita is filled with. I recommend paying the extra 25 cents for extra sauce. The Gyro is so stuffed with lamb, that you'll appreciate the flavor it adds. The salad is pretty big, but it's pretty much just a standard Greek salad. The Baklava was great, but pretty small even for it's $2.25 price. I would also suggest that George's drop the salad or fries and charge a dollar or two less for the Gyro a la cart. I really didn't want either, and would've preferred to save the cash. The wait for my food also felt a little long, but its probably because most of the food was made fresh, so I can live with that. I got my money's and taste bud's worth, and then some. I'll definitely be back at George's Famous Gyros to see what else is good here."}
{"text":"Great food. From the Gyros to the Athenian Stir-Fry. Always tasty."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com. one of the better gyro places I've had in the west coast, and the best one in AZ i've tried.  Not sure what to make for dinner? Just go to Georges gyros and get yourself a half chicken half gyro platter with extra taziki sauce.  you'll have enough food left over to take to lunch the next day... they give you sooo much food. if you're feeling like a fattie for life like me,  get yourself a baklava for dessert.   helpful tip: call in advance. if you go in person and make the order you will end up waiting 15 mins or more.. they take a while to make their food."}
{"text":"I love the mac & cheese bites  very good authentic Greek restaurant I love the fact that it's close to home the service is always good here  also the Burgers are great here! They really stacked the meat on the gyros and i will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What can I say best gyros around!!! love the gyro Fry's and the Greek chicken wings as well as the Nutella cheesecake customer service is fantastic always friendly love this place"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I was down the street at Goodwill when hunger hit. The gyro was packed with more beef than any other gyro that I've had, and it was flavored and seasoned perfectly. I disagree with other reviewers who say it looks like a hole in the wall - sure, its not your typical HUGE flashy restaurant, but they have a very welcoming staff and George himself is working there, ready to have good conversation. If you're hungry, give it a try - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Can't beat their price or their gyros! Their salad is awesome too and believe me I don't eat salad often. Go for the beef supreme gyro!"}
{"text":"Great food, tried the chicken platter which was great, ice cold lettuce in salad, fries were hot and fresh. Chicken was the star, crispy grilled strips. Also had the buffalo flowers (cauli, that is) very good veg choice although deep frying not the healthy choice! Great service"}
{"text":"I am a huge gyro fan, and these guys did not disappoint! When we walked in we were greeted and all our questions were answered promptly. They even let us sample the meatballs that they raved about. I ended up ordering the original Gyro. There was plenty of meat balanced with the regular veggies. Having french fries with a gyro is a must and their's are pretty good. Overall, we had a good experience."}
{"text":"My last review was 11 /15 haven't been there in a bit went in about a week ago my  gyro was so greasy it was hard to eat the meat was greasy the pita was greasy the salad look like it was old I have had great food there over the years so I thought they were just having a bad day or something today I went back first while I was waiting for my food a roach was crawling across the floor somebody told who look like the owner there was a roach he went over and got it and made a joke about it people wer pointing at it almost made me throw up little to say my food was The same greasy brown lettuce I threw it out I'll never be back"}
{"text":"George's is truly delicious. This place is a must have in the Tempe/scottsdale area! I've been eating here for years now and this is def our go to place for some comfort greek food. The portions are big, the meat is flavorful and the service is great. Although they are busy and wait times can sometimes be long it's worth it."}
{"text":"So amazing. Every. Single. Time.    I always get the supreme gyro and add jalepeno, 100% a go-to of mine!"}
{"text":"I went here because it was a Sunday and the other George's that I like is closed on Sunday.  We ordered a salad and a gyro to go and waited almost an hour to get our food.  From watching their kitchen during the long wait it was easy to see that they work very inefficiently. It didn't seem like they knew how or wanted to work on more than one order at a time.  I really wanted to like this place because it's so close to where I live and I enjoy Greek grill food, but after this experience I don't expect to ever try it again."}
{"text":"My recommendation is to stick with the original gyro instead of the supreme because there was way to much stuff inside that it was hard to eat. I ordered the chicken gyro and it was really good and flavorful. Definitely a hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Best Gyros I've had so far in AZ!!!! I've been here a few times and service is outstanding!!! Food is even better!! Gyros are perfect and side Greek salad is so fresh and good!! If I'm area for lunch or dinner stop by you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Food and service is always on point. I get the chicken cesar pita every time and my girlfriend loves the falafel pita. The girl at the front is always nice and my girlfriend is weirdly obsessed with her. You get a free drink when you check in. This place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great Greek place with solid gyros. Fair prices and large portions. Good service. Not the best gyro in town, but it's really very good."}
{"text":"By far the best gyro place in the Tempe area -- I have been searching for years and Georges is the best I have found in this area. After countless orders we have never been disappointed. Also, one gyro and Greek fries is enough to stuff my boyfriend and I with leftovers for our gyro loving pitbull. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at George's for years. Between my entire family we have tried everything on the menu at least once. The Original Gyro is wonderful and comes with your choice of fries or salad. Their chili is also great..... I love taking some home to make chili dogs the next night for dinner. Some of the dishes I would recommend are: - The Original Gyro - The Chicken Supreme Gyro - The Club - The Fish - The George Pizza - The Shrimp Pizza - Mac and Cheese Bites - Pickle Fries  You really can't go wrong. George and Z the owners are great people. The atmosphere is very laid back and kid friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone as there is a variety of foods to choose from. They offer great food at a reasonable price in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"The menu is great the gyros are huge and amazing best one in Arizona! The inside of the restaurant could use a good scrub and some fresh paint so I always have to get my orders to go but the sandwiches are worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyros and fries! The portion sizes were great for the price. Walked in was immediately served by Katie, who is a pleasant woman. Her service was very friendly and she was kind enough to explain the counter tops shimmering effect."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new Gyro place since I moved to Arizona. I've been stalking yelp reviews for a while, not wanting to waste time and money on below average gyro. came last minute with two other people during lunch rush. Food came out quick and the Gyro was amazing. so much meat. I am so full I can't even think about eating anything else on the menu. but... I know I'll be back! the menu has pastas and hummus. glad my search for MY gyro is over. staff was so cute, nice, and helpful! I love feeling welcome at a new place. Thanks *insert all the red heart emojis.*"}
{"text":"So.  Much.  Food.  So naturally, yes, I loved it.  The Original Gyro is a gyro, packed with meat and with a crapload of fries.  Or salad, if you're into that.  If you're a big eater, get the platter.  For two bucks more, you get basically another entire gyro, along with a full plate of salad.  Food was tasty, and the service was quick and very personable - he came by to serve us our food and even stopped by to check on us and how we were liking our food, a very nice touch for a fast food place (I'm not sure if this falls under the fast food category, but it's not a sit-down restaurant, so let's just go with that).  It's a little out of the way for me, but definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I ate here 2 hours ago and am still stuffed. The guy working said they aim to make you waddle out, not wall, and they succeeded. Oh my gosh it was all so good. I had the chicken platter and subbed hummus for the rice. The hummus was very thick, different from what I am used to. The chicken was a tad dry, but good when mixed with the tzatziki sauce, which they make in-house. My husband said the original gyro was the best he's ever had. And I am not normally a french fry girl, but couldn't stop eating them off his plate. I was curious about the meatballs, and the guy behind the counter brought out a sample for me and the hubs to try. Delicious it was, as well as the sauce on top. Great service, too. Nothing fancy inside, but overall great food."}
{"text":"Oh my... No wonder so many great reviews! They just recently renovated and it looks great inside. Service was prompt and friendly. But let me tell you about the food... Not only are the portions ginormous, the flavors are perfectly balanced out and just absolutely delicious. Their tzatsiki sauce is most definitely one of the best I've had. It's refreshing and garlicky, so it has a kick. So good! Thankfully, I couldn't finish my lunch so I got to have a second meal again of this yumminess."}
{"text":"Love this place! I eat hear at least a couple times a month. I order the same thing each time (steak pita with a salad) only because it is so amazing!   This is by far the best Greek food I've had in the area!"}
{"text":"While everything on the menu is fantastic, I go for the Gyro (Yee-roo). It is, and I have explored Gyros across Phoenix, the BEST!  The place is clean and the music depends on the combination of who is working there that day. If George and Z, his friend, co-owner and cook, are on, you get an easy mix of classic rock and contemporary pop. If Geroge's father is working with George, you will get Greek music (which I love...stay long enough for the theme to \"Zorba the Greek\"). If George's father and Z are there, you get a mix of everything.  With the police station across the street, lunchtime is crowded but safe. Off hours is easy and the wait isn't long.  Friendly and very reasonably priced with specials posted that one should not ignore. I hear great things about the chili. One day I will order a Chili Gyro. They may look at me for a moment, but they will make one and probably add it to the menu.  Friendly and great service. Become a regular and you're part of the family. Opa!  4/20/11 - Sigh! I stopped at George's on my way out of town, moving back east. My \"last meal,\" so to speak and I have yet to find the equal anywhere. So, dear diners, enjoy the fine fare at George's because you may have no idea how rare the place really is.  At this point I'm ready to ask him to FedEx me a dozen Gyros... not that I would freeze any of them. I would just sit on the floor and roll around on them, naked. Well, maybe not... but I would eat them all in one sitting!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! The Gyro Supreme is the only way to go! Well not only, but definitely a must try!! Not to mention they are from the wonderful city of Chicago. Great mixture of greek and american food. Very nice staff and owner as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch... I'm trying to cut back so me and my sis decided to split the gyro with salad. The wait was a little long but the place was packed. The girl at the counter was great at her job... Very up beat, called customers by their name (must be regulars) and when she brought out our food, she had the kitchen cut our gyro, serve on 2 separate plates and serve us 2 full salads!! The food was delicious and worth the wait. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, fresh and fast.  After having the original gyro my wife said, \"I don't want it to end,\" a phrase I have not heard her utter outside of the bedroom!  I had the Greek salad; while the base was a bag salad mix, the vinaigrette and other ingredients were delicious.  The burger patties (which my sons ordered) are nothing special (but hey, it's a Greek restaurant, not a burger joint) but the buns are homemade and topped with a delicious Dijon mustard.  I'd say stick with the gyro menu items (duh) and you'll be happy.  Restaurant was clean and orderly (George was bussing the tables himself!).  The only reason it's a 4/5 is because of the bagged salad mix and what I think may be store-bought hamburger patties; otherwise great food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the real deal Gyro this is the place. Try Georges Original with Greek Salad. Great deal lot's of good food and service."}
{"text":"I made that b***h famous!  Gyros at George's Famous Gyros in south South Scottsdale always stays lit! From the Greek isles comes to you Mediterranean food and American fusion! You see here is a SUPREME GYRO with your choice of house salad or fries. This gyros King, cause of all the lamb meat? I wanna say or beef or maybe both I'm not sure but it's a tasty treat if you're into gyros!  #supremegyro #supreme #famousgyros #scottsdaleeats #phxeats #azfoodie  Came here more than 3 times and why not it's next to my house. Always good service and always delicious unique food. Definitely check it out if you don't know what gyros are it doesn't matter they got Chicago style hot Dogs and Americanized food items on the menu also make sure you check out the menu online just in case always having a daily special as well"}
{"text":"There are many reasons to frequent George's.  The overstuffed gyros come with more meet than a Dagwood sandwich.  The salad comes with more than three vegetables and fresh kalamata olives, not black olives from a can.  The staff is friendly in a local neighborhood joint sort of way.  Don't be fooled by a similarly named establishment on Scottsdale Road, this is the place that was voted Phoenix's best gyro.  I also recommend the chili either on it's own or with fries."}
{"text":"The best steak sandwich and Gyro platters!! Well worth the long wait and is always hot and fresh. Reminds me of the great Gyro's I would get back home in Chicago."}
{"text":"Soo good!! George's has some of the best gyro meat in town! The pasta and Mac and cheese bites are amazing! Super friendly staff great service great food highly reccomend if looking for a quick amazing meal. Mmm tzatziki...."}
{"text":"George's is amazing! The Greek chicken salad is huge and always enough for leftovers. It's cheap, tasty and convenient."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Good size portions.  Very tasty.  One of the best I've had in the valley so far."}
{"text":"One word, Fantastic! Small tasty place right in Scottsdale. If your looking for real amazing greek food this is the place to go to. There salads are delicious and recommend this place to anyone family's, couples or just a quick place on your lunch break."}
{"text":"This isn't a sit down restaurant.  It's fast-casual with tile floors and self-serve fountain drinks.  Everything I've had here has been excellent.  I've had various gyros and specialty items off of their... \"specials\" menu (I think that's what it's called).  It's a great option for vegetarians, too. They don't skimp on portions.  You'll be full for $10.  The quality is there, too.  Great spot to check out if you're in the area.  In regards to service, the workers are very nice and polite."}
{"text":"I called ahead for pickup. I got the chicken plate with rice. It was a great portion. The chicken with veggies was very flavorful. The rice was a bit hard though. I definitely recommend calling ahead because there was a long line when we got there."}
{"text":"I love me a gyro. The wife not so much. So when she was out of town on business I made a point to stop in here based on yelp constantly recommending it as nearby.   The first night I stopped in and hadn't realized it was 15 minutes after closing time. Oops. The guy at the counter let me know and when I told him I was in for the first time while my wife was away he offered to get me a chicken gyro based on what was left. I decided to come back the next day.   The following day I swung by (on time!) and got a gyro and fries to go. It was less than 10$ and ginormous. Also a little bit of a wait so you know it's fresh and it was clear they make the fries fresh for the order. The meat was delicious and the sauce was good. The only thing I deduct a star for is actually being a little heavy handed on the meat and less so on the veggies and sauce which I prefer.   Overall I'm excited to go back next time the wife is busy."}
{"text":"Best Gyros, Yearos, giros, how ever you say it its great.  And its easy to find George here working hard to make sure you get the best.   \"A SMALL RESTAURANT  BECOMES THE ANCHOR  LOCATION FOR ITS SISTER shops, HOW RARE\"  I have tried all the Gyro spots in the immediate area. Georges is the Best bar non.  From the meat quality to the portion size, the meat is not weighed out the sandwiches are expected to be more than enough. The fries are great and you can sub them for a healthy salad.  Lots of veggies and a great dressing.    \"There is something to be said for a small restaurant that becomes the anchor location for its sister shops, how rare and exciting for the Valley.  Seeing a business succeed today allows me to value the spot so much more.  Thanks George, Your Gyros Are Famous!  FACTS, meats hand picked from Chicago, Great Salads, Best Gyro judged on size quality and fresh ingredients. High turn over means consistent product.   The employees lover their food"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food.  Been here multiple times and never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Best gyros around. Chicken Caesar Pita is awesome. I eat here at least once a week. Portions are large enough you won't be asking for more. Always greeted by name. Belly app makes coming here frequently even better. Free drink or entire meal, the more you come the more you get from Belly app."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price!! :D My boyfriend and I split the gyro platter that came with 4 soft slices of pita, a hefty serving of gyro meat, a very tasty cucumber sauce (i think tabulli sauce) as well as rice with marinara sauce, a bit confused on the sauce, and a greek salad that was AmAzIng, what made this greek salad stand out from the others i've had was the dressing, mmm so tasty! ...I only wish we could have tried the famous chili we heard rave reviews of but they were out, i guess we'll just have to call in advance next time, shoot! LOL"}
{"text":"George's Gyros is the best! We gave it a try  a month or two ago and I have become a slave to their gyros since. It's quality meat and their bread is so fluffy and delish. I have attempted to finish a whole one and haven't been able to do so. They are really generous with the meat and its awesome because I usually save the other half for lunch the next day. I love their fries and they give you a good amount of those also. I love the original gyro but I have been smitten with the picado gyro since I love me some spiciness!  The staff is super friendly and it seems like they all work together as a team to keep the restaurant going. The cashier is very nice and periodically checks on how customers are all doing. She stopped and had a conversation and talked about how's my people become regulars (and I can see why!). I will be coming here for the rest of my life! Best gyros in AZ in my opinion!"}
{"text":"It was good, not that great. The worker was super nice, but I ordered fries and they gave me salad but I think I was just confused while ordering since it was my first time there? They gave us free soda's for checking in though. But the food took a really long time & I didn't feel it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great spot for Gyro's. Straight to the point and great taste."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch a few times a month, and always get the Gyro Supreme. It is always great, and the staff there are quick and efficient, but also laid back and friendly. I know quite a few other people that go there often, and we are never disappointed. Great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Takes a bit to get your order, but it's worth it.  Great for take out or a very casual meal out.  DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Hi All!  This review is long overdue!  I have been to Georges numerous times, I have brought friends and family from Chicago as well.  I have to say Georges is my FAV Gyros place around!  The prices are fair and the food is very good.  I have only had Gyros but one of these days I will try something else.  The gyros sandwich comes with a choice of fries or greek salad.... I always get the salad, never tried the fries.  The salad is always a nice amount with a perfect amount of dressing...not too much but enough and it has feta, onion and even those yummy klamata olives.  The tzaziski is chunky and flavorful and is good for dunking anything in or eating plain.  The meat is well seasoned and ample and I have yet to be dissapointed!  One think I always look for when making repeat visits to any business is consistency and I have George to always be consistent.  A few visits ago the owner brought my friend and I a piece of  Baklava to sample and I would have to say.....the BEST I've ever had!  Sweet and savory but not that drippy saturated sweet, the perfect end to a good meal!  My only CON is that it takes an unusually long time to get the food, therefore I am not sure I would go there for lunch if you are on a time restriction.  Keep it up guys....you have rated high in my rating system!  I do reccomend Georges and really think you should give it a shot.  and until you do.........  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Well the ambiance isn't much to look at. Plastic silverware and paper plates don't help but the food is absolutely awesome. I had the gyro platter and my friend had the steak platter. Both were excellent. The pita bread was great and the hummus was some of the best I've had. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek food spot. It's a hole in the wall but the flavor in every dish beats every bland 9 dollar gyro plate from a cookie cutter meat shaving guy with thick eyebrows. I love the spanikopita. Try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Update:  they seemed to have corrected the problem regarding long wait times to get food. I can now call in an order, make the drive, and pickup my food in 15 minutes. This seems much more reasonable than how it was before."}
{"text":"Neither bad nor great.  Good and bad.  Good:  The food tasted good.  Place is clean.  Bad:  Menu board doesn't describe the items to provide enough information about what to order.  Coworker ordered a gyro supreme and I ordered a regular gyro.  The difference is the gyro supreme has a piece of lettuce added to it. Service is very slow as it took around 20 minutes to get our food after ordering."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for lunch!  The Chicken Supreme is awesome.  TONS of chicken!!!  You really get your money's worth.  Service is always great too.  Everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"Everything here is great! From the Chicken Pita to the Pasta. George is a really funny guy! You will have a great meal here and it won't cost you a bundle!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, laid back staff. We got an Italian gyro and Picado gyro. The meat and ingredients were excellent but the pitas were stale. Probably won't go back :("}
{"text":"Love the gyros and salads. Can't beat the customer service, everyone is always so friendly amd welcoming!!"}
{"text":"Took a while for the food but it did taste very good!  Luckily I wasnt in a rush so the delay for the grub was not a big deal."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for the first time and damn it's good. Ordered a regular gyro and fries and the gyro and tzatziki sauce are outstanding. The girl working the counter was very friendly and funny. I will definitely be going back.  Edit: I should note that I haven't even finished eating yet, it's that good."}
{"text":"How does a stop mall neighborhood gyros joint deserve five stars? First, by serving really good food. Second, by actually being innovative -- for instance try the corn fritters or the baklava. Third, by offering consistently friendly and courteous service that goes out of its way. Fourth, by offering large servings that deliver the ingredients you want, not just lots of fillers but lots of gyros or chicken; portions so large that my wife and I often share one main and a couple of appetizers and still take some home. And fifth, by doing all this with incredibly reasonable prices. A gem is a gem and five stars it is."}
{"text":"Best gyros in the valley. The meat is so moist and tender and full of flavor. If you find a better place please let me know."}
{"text":"Great gyros with plenty of meat, fresh tzatziki and all at a reasonable price! It was our first time in and he gave us our drinks for free. Thanks again!  Also, very kid friendly and they didn't mind our little hurricane creating a masterpiece on the table and floor."}
{"text":"New in town and have drove by a couple times and this place always looks busy. Finally stopped by and was not disappointed! (I get why there is always a line hahah) Grabbed the classic gyro and it had so much meat I could have made 2 gyros. Haha just needed extra pita. Okay, but really I'm leaving this review for the blonde girl holding it down, I didn't catch her name, so apologies! But she said something that just was so kind and really felt welcoming.   Literally was just, and here's your dinner while she passed over the to go bag. Not, here's your food, here you go, nope, \"and here's dinner!\"   Also totally holding down the phone, the line of take outs, inside and outside tables! Get it girl!   Just seemed welcoming."}
{"text":"The food is seriously delicious, the portions are substantial and the prices are reasonable!!  Highly recommend for a great meal"}
{"text":"This place had great reviews and it's down the street from my new job. I thought it was a traditional Greek place but it's not. I wanted beef and chicken kabob with rice pilaf but they don't have that here. I got the gyro and it's the same typical one you'd get at most Greek places."}
{"text":"I love anything that's filled with meat and wrapped in foil.  And if it's the size of my head, even better.  This place fits that bill.  Chicken pita is amaze-balls.  Fries are bomb because they use that good seasoning.  Salad-also delicious.  I'm generally not a huge fan of gyro meat so I can't really give it a fair critique, but I've tried it and it's pretty good.  This place will deliver until 7:30 pm but I've never taken advantage of that.  You can call in and pick up your order.  Or if you just order while you're there, it doesn't take long for them to make anyway.  There's some handsome dudes working there sometimes that you can creep on while you wait.  And you get a free drink if it's your first time there.  Nice work, George."}
{"text":"I was in this side of town and was craving Greek food. Checked out the reviews and thought this would be a good place to try...but I was extremely disappointed! I can't believe I'm giving the first bad review on their food... This is absolutely my least favorite place of all the Greek restaurants I've tried. They do have a young boy working the cashier/taking orders and he did okay for his age. The service was poor. I think this place lacks people skills. No one follows up to ask how your food was. Okay, yes...it's a small place and maybe the workers might be young, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't check on your customers. And they certainly didn't follow up to bring my baklava (that they forgot to give me in the first place). The food was...well...just like their service, it was poor. The food presentation looked great, but my taste buds just didn't agree. .:sorry:."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Gyros, this is the place. Compares to any top Gyro in the planet. The restaurant is clean and small. It takes a lil time to get your Gyro, so its best to call and order it 10 minutes ahead of time. One of my top places for a quick lunch with friends on the go!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I are huge fans of this gyro place. We have even turned our friends into coming here often. All their gyro sandwiches are amazing and extremely tasty. Their side salad is fresh and the french fries are seasoned perfectly.  There is always a little wait since everything is made to order, but we always call in before heading there.  Thank goodness this place is close to home and we order take out from here a few times a month! YUMMY!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The staff is nice and it is pretty clean. The restrooms are clean. Employess ask you if everything is good and see if you need anything else. They put a lot of meat in their food."}
{"text":"So here's the deal- I am on the fence about this review. The first time I had food from here it was ridiculously good. I had the chicken picado pita and everything about it was great. It was fresh, spicy, flavorful... just delicious in all ways. While eating leftovers of this sandwich the next day I think I said 'I could just eat this forever it's so good.' So, I return the next week, order the same thing but... no magic! It was still good, but not nearly as good as the first time. What's a girl to do? I'll probably give it another shot, but know that this place isn't very consistent.    Ps their greek salad is super yummy and the dressing is awesome."}
{"text":"Gyro - come for the gyro, it is delicious! It's large, full of meat. If you're not a big eater, I would definitely share it with someone else. I love that the gyro has an array of flavors and it's not just full of meat but it was lots of sauce and some vegetables like onions and tomatoes! That's how I like my gyro to be made.   If you get the gyro with the side salad, it's a lot of food. The salad is a decent amount. The salad uses iceberg lettuce though and I am not the biggest fan of iceberg lettuce. It's overall pretty good though.   George works there as well. He's a nice guy and was helpful in answering any questions I had!"}
{"text":"So good. ooooohhh gyros to die for. Had the gyro supreme with a salad. The salad was excellent too. Great dressing & tzatziki sauce. I just moved to the area & was looking for an authentic Greek place. Finally found it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to George's I always say that will be the last time. This time will definitely be the last time. The food is good but the wait is extremely too long.   Cannot recommend anyone going here unless you have one hour to waste."}
{"text":"Shout outs to their Meatball Sandwich.  It's the meal that makes my tastebuds (and my feet) dance.   I'd even recommend heating that baby up the next day.  The sauce is gushed in the center of this carefully crafted sandwich and cut in half.  That means if you're full, just accept defeat because it aint going anywhere!   Now the reason why it's a 4 star is because my wait times always longer than suggested.  Not my fault I'm trying to make moves.    The fries are less than desirable.  I've been there twice and both times I end up throwing away my meal without finishing them.    Finally, the girl at the register.  Holla at me.    Leggo"}
{"text":"No ambiance here, but if you're lucky, you might get to meet The George. Solid gyros/platters, and the falafel is tasty too! This is a go-to for my husband and me when we're craving gyros and anywhere near a George's location."}
{"text":"As I walk in I'm greeted friendly, by young lady working counter, place smells clean and appeals to all my senses. Food came out on a timely fashion and was well presented. Service Was great and quality of food was on point.  Prices are very well for proportion. My new go 2 place for Greek. Loved it. Had Gyro Supreme w Side salad."}
{"text":"Every time Im here, the young lady behind the counter is there and remembers me. She's always got a smile on her face and she knows the menu inside and out! She's definitely an asset to this company. That being said...I usually have the Greek chicken salad with is always amazing. Tons of chicken, bell peppers, onion, olives, feta, cucumbers and a greek dressing. I've had the mac n cheese bites with creamy gouda, so delicious. We did a chicken gyro with their homemade tzasiki sauce. It came with fries which were noce and hot and then we had the baklava. So delicious and nutty, not too sweet. If you want a diverse menu, great service and fantastic food....this is it right here."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here along with many people at my office about 2 times a week. The food is perfect, quantities are large and the price is right on spot.  The best part is the service and Kathrin who is there everyday I go is always the best."}
{"text":"Small little place on the border of Scottsdale and Tempe. I always order the Gyro and a Greek Salad, very good. The service is good and George always has good music playing."}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall in an old stripe center. If you are hungry, come here and try to decide what you what you will order, so many choices!!' This is defiantly a local fav, see the reviews, all good, just like the food we had...and smelled! Yum!!  Try sloppy, original, or even Italian....not to forget a Texan, with BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I have driven by this establishment several times going to either my friend's house or the tennis courts.  My friend told me its a pretty good place, so I thought I would give it a try.  I entered the restaurant and saw a wide variety of choices.  I told the gal to give me a minute as it was my first time.  After I ordered, I got a free drink as a first time customer.  I give them brownie points for that.  In addition, I wanted to add a little hummus to my chicken pita sandwich, and I got some hummus for no charge. The chicken was marinated very softly with tremendous flavors.    Next time I go play tennis, I got myself a post-match yummy meal!"}
{"text":"I seriously wish I could rate this place more than 5 stars. The staff is always, always kind, welcoming and accommodating. You can tell they take pride in their food. I've been coming here for about a year and never want to try another Greek or gyro place again. Their gyro meat is so juicy and flavorful, as is the grilled chicken. In the past year,  I've tried their cheeseburgers (\"the Catherine special\" with jalapeños, bacon and grilled mushrooms), spanakopita, baklava and deep fried bread pudding. Everything is made with love and incredibly delicious. Their portions are generous and the price is right! Anytime someone visits from out of town, I bring them here. Definitely will try more in the future, but their gyros are tried and true and what keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Reasonable prices.  Loved the Gyro Supreme.  Family-run.  The woman manning the counter was very helpful.  Left full and happy.  Our loved it too."}
{"text":"Great food. Always on point and the staff is full of wonderful personality. Katie is the most recent, of many, employees to help me fill my belly. This is a neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"Ordered the gyro with side salad and dolmades.  Salad was good...could have had more.    Dolmades were meh.  They were served cold and didn't really taste homemade.  The tazatziki served with the dolmades was mostly flavorless  Gyro was meh.  The meat was ok...nothing special.  The pita was ok...again, nothing special.  Again, the tazatziki was mostly flavorless.  It was also place on the pita vice on the meat.  The pita managed to soak up whatever moisture (and there wasn't much) was in the tazatziki.  The tomatoes and onions were also placed on the pita, vice the meat, which in turn obscured their flavors."}
{"text":"Outstanding hole in the wall place. Not much to look at but yummers! They are sooooooo nice here. The food is great. We both got Gyro plates and Baklavah and it was all delish! I would recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"Simple fast and delicious.   Casual.  Great food.  Styrofoam plates.   There is indoor seating a d two outdoor tables.   This place would be a regular stop if I lived anywhere near."}
{"text":"Great Place to eat. Owner is very cool & lady in front is very friendly. Of Course the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Best gyros I've had in this state, lots of meat, the steak one is absolutely delicious, baklava is nice, crispy and rich. Prices are pretty good and the portions of salad and fries that you get with your Gyro are more than sufficient for the money. Great service and food, I just moved to Phoenix but I still find time to get to Old Town."}
{"text":"A whole lot less for a whole lot more and a whole lot worse has been known to happen around these parts.  Good job George, love your place."}
