{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try this place out. This isn't your regular Mexican Restaurant. They serve only a few items and only carry Shredded Beef or Potatoes for their plates. You will not find your traditional Street Tacos or Regular Carne Asada Burrito here. Food is priced low but remember you get what you pay for, do not expect to get a big plate as portions are small. If you're in the mood for Hard Tacos/Gorditas/Flautas or Tostadas this place is for you."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  I first tried the food at the Yelp Art Event and fell in love with it.  Drove 20 miles out of my way tonight to take my fiance to try the food.  Soooo good.  At the event i only gotnto try the tostata but tonight we ordered one of each.   Also- the lady was so nice.  She gave us a sample of the Horchata & Jamica made fresh...so delicious!  There is outdoor seating and a drive thru.  This is not a sit down restaurant and it is hard to see from the road.  Just trust your navigator and rurn into the plaza- you will quickly find it."}
{"text":"This place has a very simple menu but it is fresh, authentic and DELICIOUS!! Try the tacos."}
{"text":"They just opened, so I had to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Excellent flavors, fresh food, great service. The owner, Ame introduced herself. Her pride and high hopes for this place are infectious. I will continue to eat here and recommend it to others."}
