{"text":"Poor customer service. I've been a fan of winco for a long time because they always have cheap prices and usually the employees are great! However both times we have gone here we found mediocre customer service and clerks that don't know what they are doing. I miss the friendly and competent winco employees from everywhere else. Please train your clerks how to scan bread, eggs, chips, etc, not by smashing them, pinning them between heavy items and tossing them carelessly, teach your meat people to throw away discolored meat not sell it hidden under good meat, (just because I am buying the ham on sale doesn't mean I want brown gross looking meat) and tell your cart boys to smile and be friendly, he should be glad he has a job."}
{"text":"WARNING TO ALL CREDIT CARD USERS


I will admit that they do have pretty good deals. But I will likely never shop here again. Being someone who has to live paycheck to paycheck while in nursing school, I rely heavily on my credit cards-which I always pay on time, I will add-to buy essentials. I filled my cart up, and got into the check out line. The cashier scanned my items, and was friendly enough, but as I went to swipe my card, I realized they didn't have a credit option. I asked the cashier, and he tells me they do NOT except credit. I had to have everything put back, which was embarrassing for me and more work for him. 

It wasn't that they don't accept credit that upset me, it was the fact the NO WHERE in the store did they state that fact. I wasted almost two hours of my time when I could have just gone to walmart, and it wouldn't of even cost me that much more."}

Prices are great
Variety

great prices on Deli food and meat section

{"text":"I have been giving Winco a try the past few months and let me tell you, I am not impressed! They are the cheapest grocery store chain... TRUE. They are employee owned... TRUE. But they're customer service is terrible! I asked a guy to look in the back if they had something, 20 minutes later I go to look for him and he is helping someone else. His response, they didn't have anything. I didn't come and tell you because I figured you would move on after waiting a few minutes! Also, they try and pass off opened food and resell it! This would NEVER happen at Frys Food / Kroger! I bought an opened bag of Gummy Bears last Friday but noticed it was opened and they put a plastic hanger on it so they could hang it, they knew it was opened! When I tried to return it, the woman at customer service was acting like I was the one who opened it. I had to point out the plastic hook they glued on it to prove that it was like that when I bought it. THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL! Also, most of their cans appear to be seconds from the manufacturer as I have gone through 3 can different can openers in 4 months. Can openers when I buy them last me for 10+ years each! Bottom line, you get what you pay for! If you don't want to ruin can openers and you want to experience good customer service, Winco should be avoided!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting pricing can be good if you shop it. Issues are not enough employees to help people with anything. Biggest issues are food quality bread and milk go bad fast, produce life is very short, cheese with mold was out for sale, and I purchased a roasted Chicken that when I got home was still bloody inside. Check dates if buying foods here and don't ask anyone to help you because they have no idea where anything is."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. Go here. Amazing deals without the pricey membership! The staff is so nice and the store is always clean!"}
{"text":"Prices are good on about anything.  Citrus looked dicey.  I didnt purchase grapefruit due to whatever they cake on it to keep the bugs and birds from eating it.  Speaking of birds...I saw a bird flying in the store tonight 7/11/2016.  No lie I pushed my cart pass the produce and saw the bird flying from the stacks of Pepsi to the produce.  I kept going to the bulk area to get my organic oatmeal and organic coffee.  Next I compared the prices of paper towels and trash bags.  Got my Brawny and taking a chance on winco trash bags.  A nice selection of beers but not at sale prices like local grocery stores.  Checked out and bagged my own bags.   See you next time Winn Dixie ..I mean Winco!"}
{"text":"WinCo is a great place to find new products at a great price produce is a great selection as well as other items in the store. It is a warehouse types shopping. You do have to bag your own groceries and you do have to pay with a debit card or cash. You can find great bargains here especially in the bulk section and the produce section. The Frozen items are also a decent prices as well as pet food i highly recommend WinCo stores"}

{"text":"This supermarket is a hybrid of wal-mart and costco.  The discounts are deep like wal-mart and the clientele is similar (over weight scooterers with kids running all over the place).  But is clean and wide open like costco and has many bulk items.  My wife and i choose this supermarket when we want to get all the groceries from one place.  if you want high quality veggies then avoid this place bc you wont find it.  If you are okay with buying veggies that will def spoil in a couple datys then you should consider shopping here bc you will save lots of money."}

 BTW open  24/7.   No crowd late night just stockers

 6 different bulk salt available    cheeses full row. But unhappy Victorville local.  Not friendly"}
{"text":"For what it is, this store is fantastic. I only go here for late-night munchies. They have ready-made food in the back, like packaged salads, sandwiches, dinner plates etc. Just heat-and-eat. 

They take every measure to keep costs low. You won't find any fancy decorations, gimmicks, or whatever else normal grocery stores do. Just a clean, blank, open-air supermarket. When I think about it, I appreciate this atmosphere. It feels more honest.

My tip is: don't be in a hurry. The check out lines can be rather slow. 

And yeah, the prices are unbeatable. Not even walmart nor costco has lower prices from my observation. If I was buying bulk, I'd probably come here."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL WHEN PLACING BULK ORDERS HERE. 

Did you know you can place bulk orders online for food storage here? Well I did. And then I realized I made a few mistakes so I called the store directly to let them know to cancel it. Sandra assured me the order would be cancelled no problem. Four days later I get a voicemail from them saying my order had arrived. I called back and said I'd asked to have it cancelled but that I'd probably be doing a corrected order sometime soon. Jamie impatiently told me that no one had told her to cancel the order and asked a little rudely for me tell her exactly when I'd be reordering because she wanted to get the goods out of her back room. When I told her the time frame she said to call her directly with the order so duplicate goods wouldn't be sent in. Being a team player sort of person I dutifully did just that. 

Fast forward a few days (this is becoming a novel. Sorry!) and I go to pick up my order at the designated time. I'm left sitting at customer service for quite awhile till the head clerk comes to tell me they only have part of my order. I asked why I hadn't been called and he said he was sorry but he and the bulk order lady weren't aware the modified order had even existed. They apologized profusely and said they'd order the stuff right away and it'd be ready by Thursday. Okay fine. 

The next day I get a call from Jamie saying she was placing the order but it wouldn't be in till Friday. What the heck? Okay FINE. 

On Friday I call before driving in asking them to please have the order ready to go at the front since I'd have my two toddlers with me. Sure no problem! I get there and everything is ready to go and the checkout lady was very kind. That's where the two stars comes from. I get back to my house and realize that that order seemed more expensive than I'd originally calculated. I got out my receipt and sure enough I'd paid $80 more than I was supposed to. So now I get to figure out what they sold me too much of and take it back. 

Three visits with two kids under three sucks. The communication at Winco (with each other and myself) sucks. 

Also Jamie is not to be trusted. Avoid Jamie."}
{"text":"Ahh, Winco. I have been to many Wincos all over California, so I was quite thrilled to find a Winco near Tempe. I am here quite often for all my grocery shopping needs. The staff is very nice and the venue is clean. Can't really say much but I felt the need to leave a review for Winco since, you know, I LOVE SHOPPING HERE. (The Wincos near Southern California can get, um, how do I say... next level ratchet.)

Pro tip: get all your spices and random foodstuff in the Winco bulk section first. DO NOT BUY OVERPRICED MCCORMICK SPICES ANY MORE, just go to Winco's bulk food section.

Their coffee ground selection is pretty damn cool too.

Another note, they have a knockoff hot Cheetohs that aren't as spicy but actually cheesier, in my opinion. Still decent TBH and wayyyy cheaper.

The Winco bulk brownie mix is honestly really good. (Shhh.) So is their bulk low fat maple nut granola.

One last note - THEIR FRIED CHICKEN DELI IS REALLY GOOD. Do it."}
{"text":"To reiterate the comments of Jim W. ----THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS!----  

This is not a store I would go out of my way for, but will continue to stop by for a few small items on my way to Costco.

Know your prices!  You can \"score\" big here, but then like a slot machine \"play it all back\" by purchasing items that are way over priced.  Just grab the bargains and go....understanding you will have to bag your own items which for me is a major drawback to doing any serious shopping.

And yes, as Jim W. wrote...the store is in Gilbert not Chandler.  It's next door to Costco on Arizona Avenue (Country Club) between Guadalupe and Baseline."}
{"text":"Clean store with great prices. We took a list of the food we buy most often to WinCo and other  grocery stores. WinCo was BY FAR the most affordable for grocery items. We drink coffee every morning and were paying $7-12 for a pound; we found the same coffee at WinCo for $5-7. You can find better deals and higher quality meat elsewhere but check the meat here too. If you watch the prices, you can get non-food items like toilet paper and paper towels at good prices."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed the selection of bulk bin items recently. I have been trying new recipes for a while, but I don't always want a big box or jar of something I'm just trying out. The bins allow me to try new recipes and then if I love them, buy big!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's always clean, the employees all seem mostly kind and wanting to help. They have great prices and they don't allow you to wait long in line , which is very important . They have competitive prices on veggies and fruits. They have many choices on nuts & spices. They have inside water bottle refillable area which I love. They keep the parking lot clean, even the customers seem to be kinder, maybe because they have huge isles, noone bugging each other. My only issue was a bad experience with a butcher, but maybe he's gotten his attitude adjusted. It was bad enough to complain but the manage handled it and took care of my needs. Thank you for being a great store!"}
{"text":"Prices were okay, but while some items are underpriced, other items are way overpriced. I want to get all my groceries at one place. I would end up spending more money if I did that here. Their fruits and veggies were old. I even saw mold growing on the grape tomatoes and spinach. Then I go to pay and can't use my credit card. This is a big deal to a lot of people nowadays. Put a sign up so people know you only take cash, EBT and debit cards! I only give it 2 stars because the employees were friendly. Also, I noticed most of their items didn't have expiration dates. I always check for dates. I think they don't have dates because the food is old (my assumption after seeing mold on foods). I will never go into a WinCo foods again. I rather spend a few cents more for food that's not outdated and won't make me sick!"}

I just wish they were consistent with their rules  and we will be back to prove my friend was just waiting for the real thing to show up in the mail. But seriously , if you don't accept paper IDS DONT FRICKEN ACCEPT THEM everrrrr ?! Wasted her time and her gas !"}
{"text":"I LURVE Winco!! As a gluten free shopper, they are super helpful with labeling a lot (not all) of gluten free items that are on the shelves. You CANNOT beat the price. 

I love that it has bulk foods, prepper foods, butter making machines. 

This location is pretty good. Haven't had any issues. Don't usually see employees out in the aisles so I don't really have experience with that. But the cashiers are very nice. 

Parking lot isn't ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been to the store about four times and I have found that the most diversified grocery store I have ever been in. This store has the largest selection and varieties of every item that you could possibly think of when it comes to grocery. They also have a very large selection of bulk items which range from cooking items breakfast items and all sorts of things including baking items. The stores is clean well lit and easy to maneuver. 
The only drawback is that the store does not take credit cards. They will take cash and debit. Also, you have to bag your own groceries.
Overall I would have to rate this store a four-star based upon the variety of items
The prices are a bit better than most of the other chain grocery stores in the area."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get... stick to walmart for everything but meat. At least walmart will let you scan your receipt and they will price match for you."}

They are incredibly cheap in some areas. AND.......I like to bag my own grocery's. I like to jam as much stuff into my own bags as I possibly can. WinCo is my place"}
{"text":"We are regular shoppers at WinCo.  Great prices and a friendly staff.  We love their pre-made deli salads and sandwiches.  We have no credit cards so cash/debit works great for us.  No one should be financing their groceries anyway. :)"}
{"text":"Hi, I am Jefe. Jefe likes saving money. My bank account likes me saving money. Other companies don't like me saving money. I don't like those companies. Point is, saving money is awesome, unless you are a communist. Are you a commie? If so, just keep scrolling comrade.......OK, American friends, I loved my first time at Winco. I will explain further, but in a nutshell, they have it all!

~What to Do~
Shop till ya dr-dr-dr-drop. This chain carries everything from produce to meat to random items like Tupperware and toys for the kids....all at great prices!

~What to Know~
Like I said, they have so much to offer. I was worried they would lack variety but I was mistaken almost immediately. I immediately checked out the healthy foods section to find numerous soy product options at lower than normal prices as well as a number of items I would never see at the regular grocery store, like Dino Kale (my personal fave). I internally price check everything, normally because I eat healthy and have specific items I am always re-purchasing. Based on experience, these prices are pretty darn low...Like $.50 less expensive tofu, which is the same brand mind you, here in comparison to anywhere else. 

~What to Watch Out For~
First, check label dates. Most items do not have a long shelf life left. Keep in mind that they have lower costs because a lot of these items may be going bad so they get them on the kickback.  A great example and something I did not notice until later when I left the store, was  the salmon I bought (at 5.98 / lb). It was old by 4 days!!!! I cooked it anyway, because from previous experience the fish is not gonna kill ya...But still, they should have pulled that item not 1...not 2.... but 4 days prior. Not good Winco! Should you come to expect old items on the shelf? No. But in general, check the expiration date ahead of time Yelpers. Some items are not as big of bargains as you might expect. Random good examples could be the almond milk and soy milk selection, which is plentiful mind you. However they had relatively the same price for all of these items as you can find at Fry's, etc.Also finally: THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. Please remember that when you go to shop and expect to blow $100 bucks and throw it on your card. Nope! They only do EBT or debit, so be prepared.

~Whammy Time~
In all, they get 4 stars, 2 for the amazing prices on the items I identified as needs, 1 for the variety for the general public, a 1/2 star for variety in my special healthy person area, and another 1/2 star for being open 24 hours. They lose a star for not accepting credit cards, and also for the old food that was left out. Four days guys.....and they never pulled it... Geesh. 

Enjoy, I will be coming back soon, once my debit account can handle it!"}
{"text":"I am so glad they opened a Winco near me. I use to have one near me where I lived in California. And one of there most awesome items is there fried chicken. It is by far better than KFC, Churches or Popeye's. I kid you not. Even after being in the fridge for a couple of days, after you heat it up in the microwave it is just as juicy as it was fresh. My grandmother would be Jealous, it's that good. There fruits are always fresh and their prices are even better than Walmart on most things. And I rather shop at Winco than Walmart any day. The people are very friendly and always helpful too. Thank you Winco for opening up near me. AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"I mean it is just a grocery store. But I love that there's never any lines when I go. You do have to bag your own groceries but that's not a big deal. And they only take debit so don't bring your credit card. Overall it's  pretty great for a grocery store."}
{"text":"It's BIGGER, CLEANER, and much CHEAPER than Wal-Mart.  You can actually see the savings rolling off your receipts after shopping there.  I'm definitely going to shop there more often.  The Wal-marteers know they now got competition.  Hence, the Savings Catcher propaganda. Er, I mean program."}
{"text":"Love shopping in your pajamas? 

Enjoy stocking up on bulk items without having to navigate around anyone that might be in your way? 

Like watching forklifts carry palettes around a giant store as the crew restock shelves?
 
Have some form of insomnia and need more orange juice?

Are you keen on the idea of sleepily buying a month's supply of yogurt without dealing with judgmental looks from those around you? 

If you are like myself, and answered yes to any of the former questions, then shopping at Winco in the middle of the night is your dream come true!

In case you didn't know, Winco is open 24 hours a day (which is pretty damn convenient if you ask me). What Winco might lack in beautiful produce, it makes up for with pretty solid prices and great bulk section. You can even make your own fresh nut butters here just like at pricier stores! Just be sure to be an informed consumer, check expiration dates on items, and know the general prices for what things cost at other stores (some items are NOT actually a better deal here). 

If Whole Foods, Smart & Final, Costco, and Walmart were spliced together in some bizarre science experiment then you'd get Winco. And if you like grocery shopping in the middle of the night with no lines at checkout then you go to Winco!"}
{"text":"They have an amazing bulk foods section. All kinds of grains, beans, legumes, dried fruits, nuts, baking supplies, and even less basic foods like cereals, granola, and wrapped candies. Also bulk honey and agave, much cheaper than you pay for bottled, and the honey is simply amazing. 

And, best of all, bulk spices. They seem to go through them fast enough that they stay fresh, and they are good quality and many times cheaper than you will find spices anywhere else. 

Now for the bad (or, at least, the somewhat annoying): they refuse to take the tare weight off bulk goods, so you can't bring your own containers to put them in. I'd love to be able to bring a jar and fill it with their delicious honey, but then I'd have to pay for the honey and the weight of my jar. Glass jars weight quite a bit. So instead, I have to fill a little plastic round with honey to buy it and then I have the extra work of transferring it and the extra waste of the plastic container. Every other store I've ever been to that sells bulk goods will weigh your jar and take off the tare, but Winco hasn't figured this out. The cashiers will look at you like you're crazy and say it's impossible."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the same one I go to that's on Country Club and Baseline. But that one is not on Yelp. Oh well. This place is like Costco without the membership.

The Good: Prices are cheap. You can almost buy in bulk. What I mean is there are lots of cheap items. There are other items that are in giant bins. You scoop them into a bag and weigh them and that determines your price.

The Bad: items and prices change all of the time. I think it's just what they can get their hands on. And no it's not costco or any other stores. You barely see any employees and things are basic to the bone. Freshness of the food is also questionable too.

Overall, it's a money saver!

Oh yeah, no credit cards accepted. Come with cash or debit."}

I WILL NOT RETURN!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I went into a WinCo store for the first time ever last night and lived to tell about it. I spent a couple hours wandering around looking at everything  and I was pretty impressed. They have a wide selection of many items for excellent prices. They didn't have everything I was looking for but they had more than the average store. I have been looking for Yuban instant coffee for months and no one seemed to carry it. I didn't really want to have to order it online and pay shipping but I've been looking in every grocery store, department store, drug store Etc that I've been in for many months and finally hit the jackpot at the WinCo.  I always thought it was the best instant coffee I ever tasted. (I used to use instant coffee all the time and then many years ago I switched to brewed coffee but do like to keep instant around for backup so I was glad to find it. I hope it's as good as I remember after all that effort to find it.)

They just opened stores in AZ a couple years ago. It's kind of like a Costco or a Smart & Final, huge, discount prices, bulk deals. They have a lot of bulk spices and grains, etc, survival foods like canisters of dried milk, dried eggs , dried honey, and such. It seemed like they had just about everything but I did not find any Big Red pop, diet or regular, no Vernors, and a few other things. And I saw a few things that I had looked at recently in other stores and knew that the price at the other stores was a little bit cheaper but many things where WinCo is cheaper. Oh, and they still had Egg Nog (1/18/17)! But I didn't need any yet and don't have any room in the fridge to buy something I'm not out of.

I wasn't crazy about having to bag my own groceries. Fortunately I didn't buy a lot so I just put the few food items in one bag and the non-food items in another bag so my food wouldn't smell like soap. They also didn't take credit cards which I would have preferred. Probably a cost saver.

There is no doubt I'll be back next time I need some items."}
{"text":"WinCo is a great grocery store with no frills (i.e. self bagging & no CC's), but you definitely see savings.

There are other stores with cheap prices, but WinCo unlike others does not have a limited selection.  There is a huge bulk item selection and many variations of popular brand items that I rarely if ever see anywhere else.

This store has always been clean and even on weekends isn't that busy."}
{"text":"I LOVE winco. The prices are great, the bulk items are a steal, love the bakery, but this last trip the romaine lettuce hearts and basil I bought had mold on them. Had to throw both away. I don't know if this is a winco issue or where the produce came from, but either way the quality should have been checked before setting out for customer purchase. Definitely won't be buying anything from that section of the store again."}
{"text":"This Winco has a sushi stand where they make fresh sushi, just like many Fry's stores, but the pieces of fish are bigger and better at this Winco.  I like the bulk stuff, and it is one of the only places that sells chocolate covered gummy bears!!!  Produce prices are usually pretty good!  You do have to bag your own groceries, but the setup is nice.  Seems there are not many registers open at one time, but they do have a self checkout."}
{"text":"Great bulk, but overall hum drum... quality issues in produce"}

{"text":"I love winco. Just moved to Arizona from Idaho.  I had no idea that there were winco locations in Arizona. The Gilbert location is the nicest one I have seen. I love it. The prices are better here than in Idaho as well."}
{"text":"I love to shop here... I have a membership at Costco but it's more convenient when I don't need to stack a lot of foods in a week and Winco is across the street to Costco which is nice, my daughter loves all the candy sections here, everybody should try.!"}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ and this is my go to place for savings.  I still will shop the sales on meats and cheese at other competitors, but this store is great for the variety it offers and their label offers a great reasonable alternative to brand names with good quality.  The bulk section is a plus because I can get just the amount that I need and a huge selection.  

The only thing that I do not like about WinCo is they don't accept credit cards which is a bummer for me.  I don't use a debit card and I don't have a local bank for cash.  I would spend much more there if I could use a credit card option."}
{"text":"This is where me and the wife do our weekly shopping.
It took a LONG time to convince her it is the right choice. She was brainwashed with all of the FUEL REWARDS from the big name grocery stores. I finally showed her that..the fuel savings as related to  how much you have to actually spend..is very low...compared to how much you actually save by going to Winco. 
For example..You goto Frys. Spend 200.  With that, you get .20 off on fuel
So, you fill up, lets say, 15 gallons...that ends up being 3.00 off on the gas...so your overall expense is 197.00.  
BUT..the same groceries at Winco will run you about 160.00 MAX.  Add the 3.00 for 15 gallons of gas you didn't save, and that's an expense of 163.00 
I would much rather pay 163.00 than 197.00.

I LOVE Winco's fresh made torilla chips. They also have a fresh peanut butter, and almond butter machine.
I also spend a lot of time in the Bulk foods section. TONS to choose from.

Oh yes, and one other thing. I LOVE the idea of bagging my own groceries. My biggest pet peeve is having to lug around 9 plastic grocery bags, with 5 bags worth of groceries. NO!! A half gallon of milk does NOT deserve its own bag!! So I do it myself, while the wife is taking care of checkout ( With MY debit card, of course)

:)

lifetime shopper here."}
{"text":"Winco has two other locations in the east valley and this one is my favorite so far.

I went there today for their grand opening and was very happy to see their store was clean and well stocked. They sent a mailer with coupons for free cake, brownie and frosting mix and they had plenty of those left around 4:30 pm!

I love shopping their bulk foods section, you can always find those rare items for great prices.
Having Winco so close by is great, now I can get all my groceries and don't have to make the long drive to San Tan area or east Mesa.
Just like at other Winco stores you will have to bag your own groceries, but it's worth it for the prices!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to shop. My husband will not buy coffee anywhere else! He likes the double dark French roast beans and grinds them at home! 
They have a few products we like that I cannot find anywhere else so for that and coffee we keep going. We have to drive farther than I normally would for groceries but it's worth it :). I also like the wide variety of bulk foods."}
{"text":"First time there a few days ago and I was back again twice before the week was over.  It's like Costco quality and pricing without having to buy in bulk.  Also, even at 3 am, practically every employee that I walked by offered to help me if needed.  I'll be doing the vast majority of my shopping here in the future."}
{"text":"Really great huge shopping center. Like Costco, but without the membership. That also includes the 'no credit card' policy- so bring cash or your debit card! Really great pricing on their products though and usually worth it compared to the 1% cash back from your credit card"}
{"text":"I'd consider this place a mix between Walmart and Costco. I hate shopping at Walmart and I love shopping at Costco. Here it's kind of meh. I've been through the whole place basically scanning the prices and taking note to compare. There are only a few things that are cheaper here than other places like eggs. I did enjoy getting store coupons every month or so when they first opened but it's been several month since I've gotten any. I love using my credit cards for cash back and that's a star off just right there. While bagging your groceries is fine, YOU NEED TO OPEN MORE LANES. I can't stress that enough. Almost every time there is only 2 lanes open and I always get stuck behind someone who is super slow and has a ton to bag. 

Fix the checkout and that's reason enough for me to check in more than once every couple months."}
{"text":"In college in California we had a WinCo and I did most of the shopping here because their prices are so great. One of my favorite things is their great bulk department. I stock up on most everything I can here like oats, rice, spices, nuts...everything and organize them all in my pantry in pretty jars and I'm saving a TON!  

My son and I discovered that they have orange chicken, his absolute favorite Chinese food, in their prepared foods department. While it's definitely a sometimes food I'll usually pick him up a container as a treat. He's even taken it to school for lunch!

Another great thing about the store is that their employee owned. I know some people don't like that they don't accept credit cards but I usually pay with my debit card anyway so it's no big deal. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I like stores that are cheaper than Walmart and Winco is it. What I like is they have people in the meat department. What I don't like, is I was looking for sourkraut and couldn't find Claussen refrigerated kraut.  But loved the free coupons. Another thing wrong is I was in the store with a friend and she almost fell because of a wet spot at the register."}
{"text":"Really...they have such a great selection of food.  Their bulk items are great (chocolate cinnamon bears yum)!  And the almond butter that you make is our favorite.  Great produce, and love it!"}
