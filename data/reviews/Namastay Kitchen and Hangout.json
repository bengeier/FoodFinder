{"text":"I wanted to love it. I loved the idea of it, but it just didn't deliver. The menu is very limited and the 2nd time I went (have been twice) I finally got a smoothie since the first time I went they said they didn't make them after 7pm. Not sure why. But the smoothie I got looked like sand (see pic) when I got it, but maybe it was sign the first time!"}
{"text":"We went there on Fri, June 3-party of 3. Food was very good, large pieces of sushi. Service was definitely lacking. Hope they can get it together. I'll give it another try for dining in but if the service doesn't get any better they will sink. Can't give away gift certificates every night for poor service."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I gave it 5 stars because everything we ordered was excellent and would order again.  I don't often say that.  The menu is great!  Want to try everything.

We split the avocado fries and caramelized Brussel sprouts to start.  Avocado fries were amazing...and much better than Tupelo Honey.  I love Brussel sprouts and these were the best I've ever had.  I had the fig and prosciutto flatbread topped with arugula for main.  Again, it was delicious!  3 for 3!  My friend had the kale Cobb with beet burger, and he loved it.  I will try the sushi next time.

The restaurant is very quiet and cozy...a nice neighborhood hangout, tucked behind the Panera Bread in Cotswold Mall.  Contemporary, clean interior, but still warm.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My meal was amazing!  Everything that my table ordered was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I'm not big on spicy sauces, but the jalape√±o aioli sauce was perfect. You cannot pick an item that would disappoint you. There are also great daily drink specials. It will become a go to restaurant for me!"}
{"text":"Great place! Interesting food and nice eclectic menu! Love the ambience and everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for us. Great drink specials and wine by the glass. Sushi was fresh and delicious and definitely the best in the area. Extensive menu. Great atmosphere with a very relaxed vibe. Will definitely be back to further explore the menu. Would be a great first date place to keep it casual. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've never written a review in my 25 years of life and today I have decided to write one. It was our first time coming to Namastay kitchen and I doubt we will ever be back. we were seated and it took 10 minutes before someone came to ask if we wanted water. We then immediately ordered and asked for a basic roll as an appetizer with two specialty rolls for our meal. It took 40 minutes to get those rolls which showed up all at the same time. Our server never came over to check on us or tell us it was coming soon. when they dropped off the food we immediately asked for our checks seeing as it had been an hour since we arrived for lunch and our server said okay. By the end of us eating she still had not brought them over. We wondered if we were supposed to pay up front so after waiting and making eye contact with several employees we walked to the front to pay for our meal. There were 3 servers and about 9 tables total. Being servers ourselves we are pretty understanding when it comes to service but I am still in shock at how awful this experience was."}
{"text":"Found this place today by accident and I'm glad I did. I ordered the sushi and my aunt ordered the namastay bowl. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because my food came out a good 15 minutes before hers did. I know this place is new, but like others said, the service could definitely improve.
Aside from that, all of our food was DELICIOUS! I'll definitely be going back to try the smoothies. This is a fantastic option if you're looking for a wide variety of healthy options!"}
{"text":"I think this spot has a fair amount of potential. It's definitely an odd location, being in a strip mall. It's a funky balance of sushi and healthy ish food. I had a spinach salad and sweet potato fries and red sangria. The sangria was pretty disappointing. The fruit was very weird, definitely not the normal sort. The salad was decent. I added fried tofu which was done well. It's a good size. The fries were definitely the best part. Just the right amount of crispness, and the right size. 

I'll definitely go back to try some of their more unique plates, just didn't have the appetite for it tonight. 

Another note - they seem to run a pretty healthy take out business, which is good to know!"}
{"text":"Got the bowl with salmon--really great food and not what you'd expect next to a yoga studio!"}
{"text":"The husband, toddler, infant and I came here today for Valentine Day as my husband wanted to give me a break from cooking. We made reservations via Yelp for 5:45pm and was seated immediately. I wanted to try a couple items on the menu and after sending it to my husband he too wanted to try some things. My review is updated but the stars remain the same only because of the amazing item I had which took up for the several that fell short of awesome or memorable.

My husband and I started with the spicy avocado rolls (small plate) which was far from memorable or flavorful to say the least. My husband also had the duck wings which he described as MEH' as they were not show stopping AT ALL. Our toddler had a cheese pizza which was yummy I say this because he is a cheese pizza critic and he loved it. My item was the BEST. I had the sweet potato falafel on a Naan which was AMAZING. I would definitely come back and have it again. Ooh my hubby had tacos as well the short rib and shrimp which were OK per him."}
{"text":"Been a few times, the food is consistently delicious and well prepared.  Nice little atmosphere tucked away in an alley."}
{"text":"QUIET SUSHI. This is a newer sushi place to charlotte. It is nice that it is undiscovered so far. The place was quiet and the service was outstanding. The servers / owner made recommendations and help me make the difficult decision as what to choose for dinner. The ambience was quiet and trendy. There was a good bit of IKEA present but tasteful. There is a nice outdoor patio that will be very nice when the weather starts cooling down. 

The avocado eggrolls were warm and a little messy. But they made up for it in there outstanding taste. The sushi was nicely sized and with some unique options on the menu. I and my group of friends will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and our three year old daughter eat here often and this restaurant never fails to impress. The menu is varied and as healthy (or decadent) as you want to be. Great specials, attentive and knowledgeable staff, and headed up by a veteran restauranteur who knows her stuff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for a celebratory Saturday brunch and were blown away by the food, service, and attention to detail. Our server Katie was kind, efficient, and made our meal even more enjoyable. The steak and eggs were cooked to perfection, the pancakes were moist and flavorful, and the sushi was super fresh and well prepared. The mimosas (mango) were so delicious- the perfect accompaniment for a boozy brunch! We will definitely add this to our list of best places to brunch in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a cool little place to grab a bite to eat. It's a small and cozy place and everyone is very friendly. 

I'd checked out the menu and reviews before we arrived so I knew I wanted to try the avocado fries for a starter. I also tried the cauliflower po'boy and fig flatbread. 

The avocado fries were delicious. I really liked the aioli dipping sauce. Also, the fried cauliflower was good. Adding the maple sriracha glaze was a really nice touch. The fig flatbread was just okay for me. 

I'd like to return and try one of their salads so I'm sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on a Sunday. It wasn't very crowded, but the space is small. Apparently, there is a new chef since I last came in. They offer $4 mimosas and $6.00 bloody mary's on Sundays. They also have a variety of brunch entrees, ranging from egg dishes and sandwiches, to benedicts, french toast, burgers and salads. I went with the fritatta of the day, while my companions went with the BEC and seasonal benedict. We also split the avocado fries for an appetizer, which were delicious. Everything was good, and we enjoyed the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mom. The smell of incense or patchouli oil or whatever it was overpowered the entire restaurant. It was a nauseating combo with the smell of the food. We got the fried avocado to start which was really good minus being distracted by the other smells. Unfortunately the rest of our food was not so great. The service was slow and inattentive. The food took forever! Overpriced and seems to be trying to have some sort of a concept but it's lost"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was a big let down.  Maybe I'm missing the point but salads and sweet potato fries don't work for me.  Since then they have moved on to Sushi and burgers?  

This place's menu has nothing to do with its name.  The branding is a serious problem.  Namaste is a Sanskrit word.  What does that have to do with anything in here?  Lost me on this one..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Very impressed.  Healthy, yet tasty, menu.  I had the fish tacos and my girlfriend had the crispy chicken sandwich.  Delicious.  Fresh ingredients and the presentation was wonderful.  Very flavorful.  The chef has put together some wonderful flavors.  Very impressed.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great food, terrific service from Amber (?), We sat on the patio which is kind of just overlooking Salsaritas but it was delicious - I had the kale Cobb which was terrific, for some reason I thought it was vegan because of the vegan ranch, but there was bacon on it which I did not have a problem with. Got a side of Gouda Mac and cheese that was ridiculously good as well. Wife had the cauliflower poboy that was good also, salad side was hugely portioned. Saw some fries go out in a huge bowl, was jelly we didn't get that."}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Delicious food. Good amount of vegan and gluten free options. Located behind Panera in the courtyard. The beet burger was amazing! Service was on point."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for veggie sushi! More than just cucumber or avocado, there were multiple ingredients per roll.  And the sauce that came with one of them was delicious.  Both rolls were very flavorful and the most creative Ive ever had.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's hard for us to write negative reviews, like this one. We want to like places.  We gave Namastay a shot on a Sunday afternoon, and maybe they just had an off day.  

But today was definitely off. The truffle fries were very good, as was the Gouda Grits dish. 

The waitress described that their \"medium\" is usually too pink for most & therefore we ordered Medium instead of medium rare burgers. They were both over cooked to the point of being a hockey puck, no trace that the party had ever once displayed a property of pink, much less red.

The kids meal came out 7 minutes after the adult meals, and those meals only came out after a very long time - where they actually took the orders around us before our order - even though we were there long before the other tables. 

One of the sides came out 5 minutes after the kids meal, at which point the adults were almost finished eating altogether. 

The kicker was: she offered us a 5 dollar coupon for our \"next visit\" to make up for all the issues.  I'm sure if you read this much, then you know there will never be a next time. Charlotte is filled with so many options, no need to waste our time and hard earned money here again."}
{"text":"The menu is HUGE so it was very hard to decide! I love the logo and the whole vibes this place gives off. We sat outside, which I can imagine to be very pretty at night. The service was pretty good. The only hiccup for us was that when we were ready to pay, the manager I think (not completely sure if she was) seemed to be in such a rush. We asked to split the check and she scurried us inside to pay, which is okay except she seemed so rush even though the restaurant wasn't busy at that time. 

The food was great! We got a Yogi Roll to share, which I highly recommend getting. The salmon on top gave the roll the perfect smokiness and the salmon tasted very buttery and delicious. I got a Namastay Bowl with grilled chicken. I am not a huge fan of the mustard sauce it comes with. It was quite watery and did not amplify the flavor of the entire bowl much. My friend and I were thinking how a peanut sauce would pair better with the bowl (especially with the carrots and red cabbage). The rice was undercooked and I am always a huge stickler for rice that is cooked well. I will certainly be coming back to try as many menu items as I can!"}
{"text":"I am HIGHLY disappointed and ANGRY. I ordered for take out at 7:34 PM. It is now over an hour later and I do not have my food when I was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. With no apologies, concern, or sense of urgency as to why my order was not ready. I will not be coming here again and I was very excited to try this place out due to advertisements seen. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"My homie and I agreed this place is easily 3 1/2 stars... for somewhat different reasons. So here go mine:

1. If I didn't read other reviews about this place being tucked in a corner behind the toys and co store, I would have been pissed trying to find this place as it's frigid cold, my back hurts from being preggers and I was hungry as hell. What's up with the signage? Like, there's wooden boards, signage, pigeons with notes everywhere advertising every place in the shopping center except for Namastay. It's like they want to be incognito. 

2. So I was immediately feeling the lady who served us. I felt truly welcome. She almost greeted me with a hug and had the biggest personality. You would've thought it was 8 am and she had 8 cups of coffee. She's the reason this place was bumped up to 4 stars. She was extremely attentive, giving detailed descriptions of every dish we asked about. She wasn't pushy and I could tell she was trying to stay out of our way when clearing the table while we were engaged in lady banter. She was dope. 

3. So finally the food. The Bahn mi was cool. I mean it ain't Bahn Mi brothers or Crispy Bahn Mi, but this place can easily hold its own. If there was one critique, it's that I like my Bahn Mi overflowing with pickled veggies. The meat was seasoned well and tender but I really need the extra veggies to really tie the sandwich together to hit a home run. So if you get it ask for extra veggies. 

I didn't try the Mac and cheese. My stomach wasn't feeling Cheese at the moment. 

The truffle fries were good ONLY with the creamy ranchy like dip that came with the avocado fries. The aioli that comes with the fries doesn't seem like aioli, it seems like mayo.... thick weird tasting mayo. So the avocado fries dip saved the dish. I think I asked for like 3 of those little dipping cups. 

I tried one of my homies avocado egg rolls. Now those were good with the avocado dipping sauce as well. I guess if you smear that dipping sauce on most anything it's going to make the dish good. 

For the prices I'm just not sure I'll go back. I gotta think about it, but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Namastay is a great spot in Cotswold Shopping Center, perfect for a small Sunday brunch crowd, or an intimate group of friends. The small space comes off its neighbor, Y2 Yoga, and offers healthy bites for yogis and non-yogis alike. Their menu includes sushi, small bites, sandwiches and pasta, with gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. I highly recommend the beet burger, which can also be added as a protein to any salad! The only criticism I have is the consistency of some menu items, which seems to vary slightly depending on when you go."}
{"text":"Me and my dad ate here last night! Plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options and also of course plenty of meat options as well.  We got the brussel sprouts  which were the best I've ever had.  Cawlifolour poboy, kale potato salad, sushi guru roll all of which were amazing!  This is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I wish I had known about it sooner."}
{"text":"I had no idea about this place until my husband decided to take me there. It was a Friday night and they had live music outside. The place looks more like a coffee shop than a restaurant but it is pretty cozy. The service was great and food good. My husband ordered shrimp tempura rolls and truffle Parmesan fries, I got the squid salad and cauliflower gnocchi. The rolls were good the fries had a good amount of Parmesan which was good but they were a little bit bitter because they were too well done in my opinion. My squid salad was great and my gnocchi was better than many that I have had in Italian restaurants. I was a little bit disappointed because the menu says cauliflower gnocchi and when I asked the waiter she said they mix it with potatoes but the potatoes are not specified in their menu. The menu is not too extensive but they have very interesting options. I will probably go back to eat the cauliflower/potato gnocchi."}
{"text":"I previously had a good experience here, but today was disappointing. The wine I ordered has been open too long and tasted skunky. When I tried to send it back they said I would still have to pay for it. The roll I tried to order wasn't available. My friend is pregnant and asked for certain items to be removed from the list and she neglected to get that right. I'll likely choose many other restaurants before heading back to this one."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Namastay Kitchen for the last 9 months eating there often and bringing friends. The atmosphere is inviting and the quality of food had been excellent.

However, something has gone terribly wrong. The last three visits have been inconsistent. My wait time for my food has been 30 minutes or more in a nearly empty restaurant and the food has come out cold. On all three visits I've had to send my food back including a steak that was undercooked on one visit.

On my most recent visit with a friend on March  26, 2018, I was so excited to go for dinner. The restaurant was empty with one guest eating when we arrived. The waitress was new and friendly. After we ordered our food Barbecue Salmon and Grill cheese with fries we waited nearly 40 minutes for our entrees which came out cold.

Our waitress quickly took my fries (my friend decided to keep her cold Salmon because she was starving and didn't want to wait any longer. 

When I asked for a manager, no manager was there. I left my number and name and asked that I be given a call to talk about my experience. No one bothered the call.

I love supporting local restaurants and there are too many good consistent places in Charlotte to patronize.

After my last three experiences, I'm taking Namastay off my list."}
{"text":"Super slow.  They don't tell you that it takes them 25 minutes to send anything out, and no bread or anything to nibble"}
{"text":"The decor was beautiful, however, the service and food were abysmal. We were one of three parties at the restaurant yet we had to wait a long time before our order was taken. It took a considerable amount of time for the food to arrive, and when it had, we found it incredibly bland and under salted. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Our meal was so incredible! We started off with the Brussels sprouts appetizer; the apple cider vinaigrette with bacon was so flavorful and absolutely the best brussels I've ever had! Then, we had the truffle fries...sweet potatoes! Seriously, so so good. My hands weren't even greasy. All of the flavors were complemented so well, you can definitely tell the chef knows what they are doing. Next we split a side of the Gouda Mac & Cheese. Holy cow! Creamy and delicious! We finished off the meal with the Guru Roll which was heavenly. This will definitely be our new go-to date spot. Not only was the food a home run but the service was great. Somehow our bill got charged an extra $4 and the manager on duty came over and apologized, without us even knowing, and offered us a gift card for the inconvenience. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Delight. My wife and I just visited this place late on a Saturday evening and the food was exceptional. Small, quaint and perfect for a dinner date. Lots of twists on good food and as fresh as fresh can be. Avacado fries, Brussels sprouts, Beet burger and Kale pesto pasta and left with a big ass Cookie. Great meal"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful but service wasn't so great. It took 40 minutes to have our food and she did not check up on us the entire time we had our food. I know it's not a problem to refill my own drink but it's just, I would like to see better service. When she gave my change back, she didn't even greet us. She put the tab on the table and left."}
{"text":"Decent food but super small portions. I ordered the fajitas and asked for corn tortillas. I was brought flour tortillas instead. The place is dead and looks really desperate for customers."}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday Chicken Sammy was great! Only bummer was the warm canned soda... served with ice (of course), but warm soda over ice just isn't good!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Food was amazing! Atmosphere was amazing! Prices were very reasonable! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I seen this place popup on my Yelp. 
The location is in the Y2 yoga place. I had a hard time trying to find this place, lucky in of the Yelpers had it I their review. 

FOOD: I had the Beet burger (see photo) and Cobb salad (see photo). The beet burger was THE BOMB.COM!!! I LOVED IT!! I will get that again. The Cobb(with just Kale) salad was ok, I wish had known the dressing came on the salad. NOW was it worth $19.00 Bucks NOPE, to know that the salad was the most and the beet burger was JUST a extra $5 bucks. I can do without the salad. Plus It was not even a lot of salad (see photo). It take about 20 mins for my order. Next time I will call ahead.

INSIDE: It's small on the inside but cute and very clean. With outside seating.

STAFF: Not overly friendly just"}
{"text":"This is a cool and quaint restaurant tucked back behind Panera bread and next to Y2 yoga. They have really cool twists on normal dishes like Mac n cheese and cheeseburgers. The indoor eating area is small, but nice, and they also have an outdoor patio area out front. The servers are attentive and sweet. I've been here twice and both times were very good, although the prices are a little high for my liking. The shopping center it's in is also always crazy so finding parking is challenging. Nice, quaint place though!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner w/ my daughter and they were steady/busy..appeared to be short staffed. My daughter's food came out wayy before my appetizer or meal came out, which was particularly weird..food was good (I had sweet and spicy avocado rolls and cauliflower po boy w/ asparagus and mac n cheese//child had rainbow roll) due to the diverse, tasty vegetarian menu and warming atmosphere we'll be back 4 sure. My cupcake and cocktail were great!"}
{"text":"Namastay is a personal favorite of mine, and whenever my dear acquaintance, Margaux, is in town, we always visit here! The atmosphere is intimate and quiet, and I love that even in the winter, the patio is open for seating due to the heat lamps that are stationed and in use! The menu offers a variety of choices all the way from Steak and Frites (fries) to Avocado fries and tofu! There is something for everyone here! 
However, in my most recent visit to said restaurant, my steak was dry and the red wine sauce, that typically is a favorite of mine, lacked the flavor and texture that It usually has. Thus, the flavor of my steak was diminished and consequently, the quality of my experience was lessened. However, I am willing to let this go, as my mother, whom I was dining with, thoroughly enjoyed her meal! 
I would love to return, and I look forward to the delightful dinner that Namastay offers. If you are ever in Charlotte, I would 10/10 recommend paying said establishment a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place tucked at the back of Cotswold Shopping Center! Sushi, sandwiches and salads with a variety of vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Fast becoming a new fave for me!  I have only done take out but I'm a fan!  Those avocado rolls are delicious and my absolute favorite!  Super tasty.  I had to try the worlds best best burger with such a claim.... it was tasty for sure but the worlds best is probably an overstatement.  It falls apart quite easily and I wish it was served on different bread but it is good.  I have also tried the namastay bowl which was okay but I wish it was a bit more interesting with a variety of veggies and maybe a suggested dressing.  The brown rice quinoa blend could have had more flavor.  
Overall the menu makes me hope as I can't wait to try more so I will definitely be back, perhaps done in.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming.  I love being able to order on line.  Makes my life easier"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!!! My husband really enjoyed the sushi and the salmon entr√©e was delicious. However, service was not attentive after ordering and the restaurant wasn't busy. I feel that our server should have come back to refill our empty water glasses from the bottle on the table as well as checking to see if we wanted additional glasses of wine instead of us having to seek her out. She was very pleasant but not attentive."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat for brunch, limited menu, food was good. Was able to make reservation as we were running late and they did accommodate. 
With just two servers working to accommodate the large amount of patrons coming into Namastay kitchen, that becomes problematic.I had to leave my seat several times during the meal  to find my server(salt, pepper, and she forgot my avocado fries) due to her having to attend to the many patrons that were here.
Will probably come again but during the week when there's a larger menu with more selections available."}
{"text":"This was located in a strip mall, it's in the back and it's connected to a yoga shop! The name of this place is what intrigued me, I love it and their logo the lotus flower ahh! They're menu is VERY big, there's a lot of vegan options & meat as well which I appreciate so so much. We ordered the Yogi roll to share, GOOD LORD I LOVE IT! The salmon was seared to perfection and it provided this fatty texture to the sushi roll so perfect! I had the Beet Namastay Bowl, I felt like it was okay! I love how fresh all the veggies were and it really filled me up. But the beet party didn't have much of a taste and I wish the carrots were cut a bit slimmer so I could eat it easier. (They were way too big and chunky) I feel like I would give this place 5 stars if I could try more things on their menu, so I'm really looking forward to coming back next time to ordered more rad food!! 
** update! Came here for dinner a second time and I love this place! I really recommend the fig flatbread and the sweet potato gyro! Both was so yummy and filling. I love how everything fills up & is so healthy! Plus it's \"real food\" bonus! (:"}
{"text":"I'm here a lot. And I always order the same thing because it's SO good. The Namastay Bowl is filled with quinoa, carrots, cucumber, and avocado with ginger dressing. I add tofu and order roasted cauliflower as a side. Crazy delicious and healthy. Bring your favorite vegetarian or vegan!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a couple months, but it took me a while to get over there. 

I went with a girlfriend, it took us a little while to locate the restaurant as it's tucked behind some shops at the Cotswold Village Shopping Center. Thankfully, when we got out of the car we noticed some sandwich boards that pointed to where the restaurant was. 

You walked into the covered patio area to enter into the restaurant. The covered patio is heated which we really appreciated for two reasons, the restaurant is small so they need the extra seating and it was a cool spring evening. When we first walked in we were greeted by a waitress who was on her way outside to check on some patrons. We asked if we could sit outside and had a little bit of a brisk interaction with the waitress who seemed annoyed that I asked her if we could sit outside (at any of the clearly open tables) -- it was a little strange. 

We were sat a little two seater table. As we were sitting they were slightly clearing the table too, it was a little odd. It mostly clean, but there may have been a napkin or something on it. We were brought water by the waitress, Nicole. She was very sweet and answered what questions we had about the menu. She was honest about her likes and dislikes which I appreciated. 

We eventually ordered the Namastay Bowl - quinoa and brown rice bowl with avocado, carrots, cucumbers, purple cabbage and I asked them to add on the sweet potato falafel and ginger dressing on the side. My friend got the cobb salad and also asked for sweet potato falafel. 

Our meals took about 25 minutes to come to the table. I found this a little off putting considering the restaurant was that full and our meals did not need to be cooked (minus the falafel). 

I was seriously impressed with the meal though! It was hearty, flavorful, and delicious. It was presented really nicely too. 

As I checked into yelp, I was presented with a 50% dessert coupon which I used. According to Nicole, they only had their big ass cookie (chocolate chip) and gelato because they are in the middle of changing their menu. We ordered the cookie... it will NOT disappoint you if you are into the almost doughy cookie thing -- which I am. It was really tasty and very large. We ended up taking about 3/4 home. 

Many items on the menu sounded good such as the turkey burger, gnocchi and pita pizza. 

All in all -- I'm impressed and look forward to future meals here. They do brunch as well, so I'll have to check that out!"}
{"text":"Decided to take my daughter, who is home from college, to brunch here. I've been wanting to try it and she's been diversifying her diet since she started school. I had the beet burger (no sprouts) with the vegan ranch. I know, vegan ranch doesn't make sense, but it was actually very good. My daughter had the chicken and biscuit. We both got the gouda grits as a side. The food was very good and the portion sizes are bigger than expected. Usually the fru fru spots double charge for half the food. Not the case here. I couldn't finish all my food; however, my daughter did, lol. 

Next time I'm taking my husband and we are going to try the flash fried brussel sprouts! I think we will go when they have the regular menu since he's not much of a brunch person. They have sushi, kombucha, and mimosas, so it's very trendy. Plus, it's kind of hidden away and in a shopping center where you can multitask (grocery shop) without leaving the general area. We enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have loved it each time. Today, I ordered the tacos, which the kitchen happily made vegan.  Their corn tortillas aren't vegan so they came inside lettuce wraps, even better! One taco had korean tofu, one had cauliflower, and the third was portobello mushroom.  All three tacos were topped with perfectly ripe avocado and pickled carrots. The vegetable of the day was sauteed red cabbage that went well with the tacos. 
On my last visit with my husband we ordered the brussels sprouts to start.  SO good! For our entrees I tried the Namastay bowl with a beet burger on top and my husband ordered the tofu scramble.  Both entrees were also excellent!  I highly recommend Namastay kitchen! The menu is diverse, cute atmosphere, decent service, and good drink menu."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out, the name sounded really cute! The food wasn't bad, it was just okay. I got sushi and some French fries (which both were definitely over priced) $3 for a side of basic French fries? Come on.

 The service was also kinda slow for it to only only be two other parties in the place when I was there. I will definitely try it again sometime and I do recommend others to try it as well!"}
{"text":"Found this place walking around waiting for our IHOP reservation, so happy we found this instead. Great menu selection of some higher quality food and ingredients. The service was great and friendly. Food was great. Definitely will be coming back. Also it smelled amazing in the restaurant and the music was on point."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of places that I'm able to walk to from my apartment, so when I was recently searching Yelp reviews and found this nearby, I wanted to visit. 
I went with a friend on a Wednesday evening around 730 and it was pretty empty (I think it's getting my popular though.) As others have mentioned, it is in the back of Cotswold village next to Y2 Yoga.
It is a cool vibe, with good music and fun decorations. They have an extensive menu of sushi as well as \"healthy\" food. It was difficult to pick something as they had such a large variety.
They also have a pretty fair drink list. They had a special (not sure if it was that night or always) where they had $5 glasses of wine for certain wines, so I decided to take advantage of their white special.
I ordered the Salmon Lover roll, the Ahi Tuna Tataki, and the Roasted Cauliflower side, while my friend got the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese, Kale Potato Salad and the Sweet Potato Falafel Gyro.
The Salmon Lover roll was incredible- great flavor, little bit of crunch (sometimes it can be overwhelming if they fill it with tempura flakes) and good variety. I would highly recommend this roll if you like salmon, even a little bit.
The Ahi Tuna Tataki was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away.
The Roasted Cauliflower was good, but small-ish for a side.
My friend really enjoyed the Sweet Potato Falafel Gyro and the Kale Potato Salad, but wasn't that impressed with the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese.
The servers were friendly.... but it was really slow. I waited about 35 minutes for the sushi, and by that time we were only 1 of 2 tables left. Luckily, they were nice but if you are expecting a quick dinner you will probability not find that here.

Overall though, great food, decently priced, and a good location in Cotswold for those that want to walk to avoid that crazy parking lot."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the outdoor seating is perfect. Try the Brussel sprouts, they are the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies and food great atmosphere and even better concept ! Love must try !"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, but they are a little disorganized.  If you are in a hurry, you may want to choose somewhere else.  Nonetheless, the sushi is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor seating! Food was great and can't wait to go back to try the Mac and cheese. Thursdays are also 1/2 bottles of wine night! It took a little while to get food (why 4 stars and not 5) but our waitress was super nice!"}
{"text":"Waiting 45 mini for a salad at lunch when the place wasn't even quarter full is ridiculous. They need to get it together! No apologies of any kind either. The terrible service and inconsistent food is going to keep me away from here until they get new management."}
{"text":"This is a tucked away/unassuming sushi spot but it is AMAZING! I honestly think it is the best place for Sushi in Charlotte. The menu has a nice variety of items so if you go with a group anyone could find something they would like. I love that they have delicious healthy items, but I can also order truffle fries or fried avocado. It is also vegetarian friendly. Did I mention they have half priced wine night?!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect for grabbing brunch with a couple buddys today. I eat a plant-based diet so I tend to be a bit picky about where we go. They had a great menu with options for all of us. I had a mimosa and the beet burger with sweet potato fries. It was delicious. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable and the service was friendly and helpful. I will definately be returning for lunch or dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Talk about the true definition of a hidden gem! I am really impressed with Namastay Kitchen. It is in the back of Cotswold Village right beside the yoga studio and across the walkway from Salsarita's so it is somewhat hidden but talk about a gem. Most impressive was how great the folks are there - very friendly and accommodating. The menu was pleasantly interesting. From sushi to some nice vegetable sides and vegan main course options, it covers a lot of territory giving diners some really good choices. I had the turkey burger with fries, all of which were perfect (especially the fries - I'm a fry snob, just sayin'.) My friends had the turkey patty melt special with roasted parsnips. All was really fresh and good. I already have plans to return for lunch this week."}
{"text":"The \"burger of the day\" was phenomenal !!!! Service was quite slow despite being less than half full! Will definitely be back to try the wonderful sushi selection."}
{"text":"Me and my fianc√© have been looking to try this place for a while, it seemed like a cool little spot to check out. Initially it took someone forever to seat us. The servers are nice but the service is slow.  The menu is limited, the food is okay. Overpriced in my opinion. If you're looking for great food with flavor this isn't the spot. Taste like hipsters and gentrification."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll probably come back!  Quaint trendy tucked away spot in Cotswold Shopping Center.  Kinda hard to find as the sign is hard to see from the street but next to the Yoga spot or adjacent to Salsaritas! 

Our waitress was prompt, courteous and honest about menu items we asked about. I like that! We chose to sit on the patio and our service did not suffer as could be the case with some places.  

We started with the Shrimp  appetizer and it was tasty  with a lil kick on the back end but the ran out of the crostini it was to be served with and we had to ask for a substitute! 

My hubby had turkey burger with fries and I had the famous beet burger with Gouda Mac n cheese - my beet burger was good and filling but a lil messy as it doesn't hold its shape very well!   The Gouda Mac was okay not horrible but not especially memorable as it lacked strong Gouda flavor I was expecting.   

If you check in you get 1/2 off desert and because they were out of everything but gelato  gelato  it was.  This too was good but not especially memorable either.  

Overall it was a good experience and I'll return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Calming atmosphere with a nice staff. A small venue so I would call ahead if you are headed there with a big group! Overall very good reviews of the food from the family. I had the beet burger which was good but was kicked up a notch by adding the vegan ranch. It's a stretch to call it the \"World's Best\" but if they changed the bread to be a bun and added more avocado and sauce, they'd earn the true title as \"World's Best!\" As my side I chose the roasted cauliflower and was not disappointed! Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Oh my Lord!!! Love this place!! Met an old friend for lunch at this cute little restaurant. It's connected to the Yoga place next door - same owners. I arrived early and was nicely greeted by a server (I'm so sorry I don't remember her name). Upon my friend's arrival, the server explained the menu offerings to us and was very knowledgeable about the dishes giving details and suggestions. She was very friendly. I ordered the Sweet Potato Falafel along with the Summer Strawberry Salad. Oh MY!!! It was SO delicious! Every single bite was yummy. My friend ordered the Namastay Bowl with salmon added. She also raved about her meal. During our meal we were already planning our next visit! The atmosphere, the service, and the food were all excellent!! Definitely will be back SOON!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was lacking as they seemed to be understaffed. It took forever for the food to come out and when it did it was very staggered. I got my entree and my side took 10 more minutes to come out. So even though i like the food, i would be in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Charlotte...this place has a little something for everyone.  Hurry and eat here before they get popular and you can't get in the door!"}
{"text":"A new favorite, neighborhood spot! You have to look hard for Namastay... It's tucked all the way at the back of the Cotswold Shopping Center, behind Salsaritas and the toy store, beside Y2 Yoga Studio. But, it's worth the hunt! Particularly exciting since there's a pretty serious deficit of good food in Cotswold. Sure, we love Block and Grinder and Pizza Peel. But, after those two, it's just a bunch of chains -- Panera, Chipotle, Smash Burger, oh my! -- or so-so spots. I'm not going to lie, I only wandered into Namaste because I had a Living Social voucher. My first meal there with friends was so good, I actually saved the Living Social voucher for a future visit with Ted. 

Everything I've tried on the extensive menu is fresh and flavorful. I'm a big fan of their Remix Salad with a protein (chicken, salmon and tofu are my fave add ons) for a healthy, relatively low-cal lunch. There are loads of other healthy opinions if that's what you're looking for. Or, if you're throwing your waistline to the wind, there's also indulgent items like gouda mac and cheese, egg rolls and truffle fries. Wonderful sushi selection, just a tad expensive compared to the other side of the menu though. 

Service is always really attentive and friendly. (Lunch time is slow and quiet in a good way.) I love their unsweet, iced green tea. It has a great, citrus flavor. I think they must add a squeeze of orange or something. And, it always smell so good in the main dining room -- a similar smell to the massage studio I visit -- I leave in a very zen state every time."}
{"text":"Namastay is connected to the Y2 yoga studio in Cotswold and offers a variety of semi healthy and tasty food options. I finally got the opportunity to eat here after eyeing this place for a few months. We tried the pork belly banh mi with sweet potato fries and the super spicy tuna roll. The sushi roll was actually pretty good although not spicy at all. The rice was tightly packed and it was a good proportion of rice to fish. The real reason I'm excited about this restaurant is the pork belly banh mi. I don't know if it was the aioli or the pork belly that has me craving another but I'll definitely make my way back for this sandwich!"}
{"text":"My wife is a yoga teacher at a prominent yoga studio in the city, but she's not a foodie.  I'm the one that cooks and enjoys fine food.   
This place does a really well with balance between good and trendy food.  Although some of the dishes are named after yoga moves, they spend more time on the quality then the creativity of the dish's name. 
We had fish tacos that were fresh, but lacking flavor, I wouldn't recommend them.
The ceviche wasn't really ceviche, but it tasted good.  It was chunks of different types of sushi in a martini glass with some type of citrus flavoring.
Quinoa side was bland.  
My wife liked this place a lot more than I did.  I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, vegan friendly. Beet burger and cauliflower are to die for! But, it's a bit on the pricey side for a casual restaurant. Wish it was more approachable for a quick mid week meal. But, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Hubby and the Littles brought me here for my pre-mother's day dinner, and I'm SO glad they did! Definitely added to my favorite spots! Hubby and I ordered two rolls to get us started:the Buddha Roll and the Baked Izumi Dai roll. The Izumi...WOW!! So, so good! Both rolls were big and hearty and had nice presentation. We also decided to split the special because it sounded amazing, and it's the weekend, so diet is not the priority tonight. The special: The Creekstone Grass-fed Beef burger (burger with smoked gouda, bacon jam, arugula, and garlic aioli). Again, amazing!! We also had cocktails (me:kinky pink, him: old fashion w/makers mark). Yummy drinks! Kids had chicken fingers w/ sweet potato fries. Fries were delish- crunchy outside, soft inside. 
So, to reiterate. ..everything we tried was absolutely delicious, and I can not wait to return to try more items!!! (Likely sans kids next time)"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the wait for the order was excessive.  I am not sure that I  will be back."}
{"text":"As a new vegetarian, Namastay was the perfect place to go. They have a menu with lots of options for those who enjoy meet and for people like me following through on their new years resolution of going vegetarian. I've ordered their Sweet Potato Falafal and it is amazing! 

Keep in mind - the entrance is hard to find and the seating area is not large. I've never had an issue with any wait time but if you have a larger group, I would definitely call for a reservation."}
{"text":"Food is super fresh, many vegan/vegetarian options. My favorite are the shrimp tacos! It's a cute little hideaway!"}
{"text":"After looking at the menu I was upset I'd never heard of this place!!

Everything is decently priced and there are many gluten free options.

My favorite thing was the Brussels sprouts. Definitely a must-try! The sauce is just amazing - I dipped everything else I ordered in it!! 

The sweet potato falafel sounded amazing but actually was just okay. The flavor of the sweet potato wasn't very strong. 

The cauliflower po' boy is very flavorful. You can taste every ingridient the chefs use. 

Everything on the menu seems well thought out and I've been happy with every visit! A must-try!"}
{"text":"We went to Namaste restaurant not really knowing what to expect and ended up getting small plates. The avocado eggrolls were delicious and the dipping sauce that was with them added a 
 spicy note to it. The roasted brussels sprouts with bacon were fantastic and the sweet with the smoky was delicious. We had grilled coconut shrimp which was really a nice change not having the fried and having the grilled version it was wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been scoping out this place for a while. I had heard of it but could never seem to find it. If you're looking in the Cotswold area you will need to walk through the breezeway behind the Panera, and the Salsarita's, to get to Namastay. It's a little small, but they do have outside seating available. Even in the cold weather they've got it tented off so that it still usable space. The menu is eclectic, and very appealing. They also serve sushi and are partnered with Sushi Guru in South Park. In addition to good eats they also have a full bar, handcrafted cocktails, and smoothies.
The staff was friendly and attentive, but didn't hover. I could see this being a problem for people who are in a hurry, but I was just relaxing so it was fine with me.
I had the pleasure of trying the turkey burger on my first visit. It was amazing! I can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Ate for our first time here yesterday and have mixed feelings.  First the good.  The food was great.  We had three of us including our 3 year old son.  He got pancakes and ate every bite and I tried them and they were very good.  Had a good crust on the outside but fluffy on the inside.  My wife opted for a salad with salmon and was very satisfied.  I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon avocado and pimento cheese. This was fantastic, the bread made this perfect and the eggs were cooked just right. The negative of the experience was the service.  We waited quite a while for the server to come take our order.  Once our food came we never got our water refilled and all three of us were completely out of water.  It also seemed to take a very long time for the food to come and it was not very busy.  They also should have non glassware for children to drink out of. If the service picks up this would be a 5 star review.  Overall great food with a interesting menu that has many categories of food.  They don't seem to have a focus on one type of food."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I've never actually set foot in Namastay, but instead have only ordered from it through Postmates. I've had mixed experiences and would rate closer to 3.5 stars but the delicious beet burger and thoughtful take out packaging knock it up to 4 stars. 

My go to order is the beet burger with the remix salad. The portion size of the remix for being a side salad is pretty generous and it's not just a basic salad in terms of toppings so that's great. The vegan ranch is very tasty! The beet burger is awesome though and I'm a fan of the bread that it's served on. The mac and cheese can be hit or miss. I've had ones that were excellent but my last order it was very bland. 

I would not recommend the sweet potato falafel or the kale potato salad, however. Both were frankly just not good. My mister wouldn't even finish them and he eats like a garbage disposal."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but sadly my first visit here wasn't very good. We were sat in the corner of the restaurant where the door to y2 is so people were coming and going during our meal and also it was very cramped and messy next to us. Then it took 25 minutes for our food to come out. I hope next time I come the service is much better because the food was really good"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very small and intimate.  They have an indoor and outdoor space and even a bar area.  They have some pretty good happy hour deals, worth checking out.  The staff is really nice and helpful with the menu.  They had some good suggestions.  

I first tried the avocado fries and they were delicious!!  Way better than I expected.  I also enjoyed the cauliflower po'boy.  It had a spicy kick, so beware!

It was a tad pricey, especially if you are just stopping for lunch.  But, the plus side is the happy hour specials and if you go for dinner, it's not too bad.  

I would come again and definitely have the fries, but wouldn't mind checking out some other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"A real nice place . Loved the healthy food options there . Staff is really cooperative."}
{"text":"Hidden secret and I am happy about it. Found this place on yelp by accident. Food, service and atmosphere was amazing. Strange diverse menu, but loved it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant connected to a yoga business. It's refreshing and simple. The food is outstanding. If you like Brussel sprouts, you will love theirs. I can never get enough of them. Their sushi is delicious and fresh. The staff is so pleasant. They kept us comfortable and checked in with us while we were waiting for a seat. We were pretty much waited on while we were waiting. This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start.....the menu is extensive and it was tough to decide as everything sounded so yummy. We had the BBQ Salmon, Gnocchi, Duck wings, Sweet potato falafel Sammy, smoked Gouda Mac & cheese and the Beet burger on the Namastay bowl. Not a single complaint in the bunch in fact talking gave way to yummy sounds and \"can I try that?\"  
The service was excellent, very attentive but not smothering, friendly but not false or smoozing for a big tip.  Ya know.  We were a needy and a bit picky bunch so I think they were very nice about all our questions. 
The atmosphere was cool, very zen. 
It is tucked into the space between Panera brea and the Toy store in Cotswold Square or Village....??? So you have to look for it. Just head toward Y2 Yoga and it's to the left. 
I will def go back again."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I would give Namastay a 3.5 but we all know you can't give half stars so I'm gonna go with a 3. 

I got there before my girl friends. I drove around the parking lot a few times and didn't see signage for this place. I tried to call their phone number but no one answered. I asked the security guard where it is and he had never heard of it. Finally, after walking in the freezing cold, I found it. I walked in and waited a few minutes before I saw an employee and was seated. Because I was early, I tried to get some work done (FYI: no WiFi). Our waitress was super sweet and checked on me without seeming pushy. 

My friends got there and we shared the avocado fries and avocado egg rolls. I loved the avocado fries (especially the sauce, which we ended up putting on EVERYTHING) but wish there had been more to the avocado egg rolls (maybe some black beans or something?). For my meal, I ordered the shrimp tempura and the philly roll. They were pretty good - I brought some home to my husband and he agreed that they were good but not the best sushi he's ever had. 

Overall, it was irritating to get to and the food was good but not great. I wouldn't dread coming back but won't make a special effort to return."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a girlfriend at Namastay on a Tuesday night. We were seated in the outdoor covered patio area and there were only a few other tables of patrons.

We perused the menu, asked a few questions, and the waitress gave us her honest feedback on what she liked and didn't like on their menu. I settled on the Cobb salad (added sweet potato falafel) and my friend had the Namastay bowl (also added sweet potato falafel).

It took a while for it food to come out, which was somewhat surprising given how empty the restaurant was and that we both ordered salads. 

The food was worth the wait - fresh, flavorful, and well sized portions. I especially loved the kale in my Cobb salad - it was not tough like typical kale. My bill was ~$20 for a salad and water. 

I enjoyed my dinner, and I'd be happy to try this place for lunch or brunch!"}
{"text":"wow... TERRIBLE food AND disrespectful staff... i had so many problems it was unreal. When i complained about the food the manager was rude and dismissive. Also... the atmosphere: drunk people screaming everywhere..... an ABSOLUTE waste of MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!  Barely any VEGAN options as falsely advertised on their site ! DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Charlotte! Attached to Y2 Yoga, this place has the most incredible sushi, salads, sandwiches. There are a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. 

I got the stretch sushi roll and my mom got the beet burger on the remix salad. The sushi was amazing and the beet burger was incredible. We also got the avocado fries as an appetizer which were good.

A must try for anyone in the area!!"}
{"text":"Namastay is truly a hidden gem. No, really, it is neatly tucked away behind Salsaritas and a toy store. Adjacent to Y2 yoga, the calming and relaxing vibes transcend into this space. It bodes the charm of an outdoor market, with colorful silkscapes draping the ceiling, but retains a welcoming and subdued atmosphere.
They have a wide array of fresh, made to order entrees, and most are vegetarian and vegan friendly. We did not indulge in sushi this trip, but from the rolls we saw being brought out, they looked delicious! 
I selected the beet burger and enjoyed it accompanied by sweet potato fries. The consistency of the burger was great, and the horseradish based topping provided it with the perfect amount of kick! The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, not greasy, and came in an appropriate portion.
We also got a flight of sake- I had never had other variations, and enjoyed trying mango and rose water sake.
Tips to ourselves for next time: try the sushi and fried avocado"}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience we had! My best friend and I came here for lunch. 

Upon being seated we heard drink specials, one which I couldn't pass up. The cucumber margarita. It was so incredibly flavorful and refreshing! After that we ordered the sweet and spicy avocado egg rolls. OMG OMG OMG! So much flavor! It was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. So good! 

Then after a bit we ordered our entrees. I ordered the chicken caprese panini. So so so good! My best friend ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread. It was good too! 

After deciding we had died and gone to healthy good heaven, I had to get dessert. I originally had ordered the vegan chocolate cake but was told they didn't have it today. No big deal to me. I ordered the oatmeal cookie ice cream sandwich. It was drizzled with honey. I can't even explain how delicious it was! My only recommendation would be to heat the cookie so it isn't so hard to eat. 

This place is amazing and I hope will become a staple for this area. 

Our waiter, Rex, was very attentive and offered suggestions. Always had our drinks topped off and on top of everything."}
{"text":"This was actually the third time we have come into Namastay Cafe and Hangout, and I am sad to just now be getting to the review! 

Short version: it's an absolute favorite and our new go-to neighborhood dining spot. 

Longer version: Namastay has the perfect ambiance to relax in as you wind down for a meal. It is a completely judge free environment. Come dressed like you normally would for dinner or in your workout clothes. They see it all, they are attached to Y2 Yoga and I like to come after taking classes at Flywheel down the street. 

At dinner time the tables always have soft candle light, the music is playing just perfectly, it's clean, and you just can't beat the menu. There are plenty of drink options from recovery smoothies to cocktails to wines and beer. 

**8/21/17 update**
Taking a star off. I still respect the food and how tasty it is. We also still come here often.  However, they desperately need to speed the service up. It has gone way way down since my first visit. The wait time for service and food prep is almost inexcusable. Please fix this! We love this place. But it's getting close to if this stays consistent, we cannot even fit into our evenings."}
{"text":"Namastay is perfect for one:one dinner or a date with your girlfriends! My husband and i frequent namastay, mainly for the Brussel sprouts and the beat burger. But we always start with a sushi roll. When I'm out and about in Cotswold shopping center or after yoga I grab a smoothie to refuel! The only down side is the service is slow and it takes a while to get food from the kitchen. I never go when I'm in a Hurry or when we have a big group of more than 5! 

Make sure you drop in on Sunday for the brunch menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good and a little on the eclectic side. However, the time it took as to actually receive our food was ridiculous. They had decent live music in the outdoor seating area as well. I received the plate of three tacos the cauliflower was underwhelming (and I love cauliflower) and the tofu was overcooked. I'd be willing to try it again if I were in a bind simply because the people were nice and the music was good, but if you have other options readily available, go with them."}
{"text":"Oh... I so wanted this to be better. It's a cute place with a nice patio, tucked in the back of a shopping center and neighboring a yoga studio. Service was good and we had a very nice bottle of wine (for half-price, even) but the food was lackluster at best. The ingredients are obviously good, but enough care wasn't taken in preparing them and seasoning was sorely lacking. The sushi was fine - nothing spectacular. Appetizers of Brussels sprouts and sweet potato falafel were bland. Gnocchi was overlooked, as it so often is. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Service sucked. This was my first time here. Service was very poor. I could hear a yoga class going next door. Food took forever to come out. They charged my extra for more bread for my hummus. Didn't give me enough to eat all of hummus. Food was good. Small portion size. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hard to find, but worth it.

LOVED the amazing contemporary decor and choice of inside or outside dining.

Service was okay.  It took a long time before someone took my order. 

The variety of vegan selections was impressive.
I had the sweet potato chickpea cake, avocado sandwich, and kale potato salad. All were good.

I would come again."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place...the menu is good.  However every time I try to carry out I am disappointed. I am in the restaurant now waiting to carry out my food.  The staff is very nice and said my order really would take the full hour to make because they are busy tonight...fair enough. Except it's Monday night. There are 9 people in the restaurant including me.  I ordered cauliflower Poboy, duck wings, Gouda Mac and 3 tacos.  Not sure how these seemingly quick dishes take an hour to make, but I hope they are mind blowing my delicious. 

If these dishes sound like they are worth an hour of your time, you should come to this restaurant. Check out the picture for how busy it is tonight.

Update: after an hour and 20 minutes I was offered $10 in \"Namastay Bucks\" (which are probably worth 5 Schrute bucks). You know the restaurant has a problem when they have a currency for their mistakes. After that I was told my food was still going to take 'a bit'.  Unfortunately I had to call it quits and asked for a refund. The staff was very nice the whole time, but until the management can figure out the kitchen I am going to have to stay away from Namastay.  

I returned my Namastay bucks because I hope they aren't a currency soon, just figure out the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Namastay Kitchen is a hidden treasure trove of healthy food choices. I was in a hurry so I chose the grilled shrimp with sweet chili and coconut. The shrimp was cooked to perfection, succulent and well seasoned. 

I'd love to return when I have more time!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our anniversary dinner at this place. Great food options for vgeterians. The avacado fries were one of a kind so was the beet burger. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Namastay is a great new spot to consider if you're looking for fresh, healthy food packed full of flavor. During my first visit I had the Avocado Sandwich which,honestly, was better than I'd even imagined it would be. While the bread was a bit tough to bite through at first (I'm pretty certain that it was because it's whole grain) it didn't stop me from devouring it. It came with a salad which was dressed in the house vinaigrette.
During my second visit I brought my best friend with me and i had the Prosciutto Fig Flatbread and that was one of the best things I've eaten since I've been to Charlotte. It's safe to say that Namastay will be one of our staples!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is a hidden gem! It's Located next to Y2 Yoga in the Cotswold shopping center. My boyfriend and I ordered the avocado fries and hummus. Holy guacamole!! Those avocado fries were SO GOOD! I got the lobster roll with truffle fries and my boyfriend got the beet burger and the kale potato salad. Everything was delicious! I don't know about the other negative reviews regarding the wait for the food, but we were in and out in less than an hour. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu with all sorts of interesting tastes combined in ways I haven't had before.  We went on a Saturday night when the small restaurant tucked into a pocket of Cotswold village was about 2/3 full.

The food did not disappoint.  I had the Namastay bowl, with brown rice, quinoa, carrots, cucumbers and avocado with tasty ginger dressing.  Yum!  For the \"protein\" there are lots of choices to add, including tofu. 
 I really wanted the steak added but it was outrageously priced at $12 for a topping. But it was very good.  My friend had the turkey burger which also had bacon and sweet potato fries on the side.  He really liked both.

The wait from the kitchen was quite long when the place was only 2/3 full so I'd hate to see it when it was full.

I'll give it another try though b/c the food was so good and I want to try the fig and prosciutto flatbread, sweet potato falafel and sweet chili coconut shrimp.

One more thing--it's listed under some headings for sushi, but there is no sushi on the menu."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and took forever, and they frequently lose take out orders. Will NOT be going back. Also the name is deceiving because the food is not Indian at all. Truly wish I hadn't wasted my time and money on this place- and a lot of it for a simple salad."}
