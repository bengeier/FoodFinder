{"text":"my oasis after a day's stroll in the city. i was looking for a coffee place to sit and hang around after going to the Museum and this place is perfect. couldn't be happier when they're serving Kombucha as well :) the guy there is so friendly and cheerful too :)"}
{"text":"Not very often do I see dirty Chai listed as a menu item at cafés. Typically when I order dirty Chai lattes at other cafés, I get a confused look from the barista and have to explain what it is (Chai latte with an espresso shot). So it impressed me to see it listed as the last item on Leaves Cafés menu. At $6 after tax, I do think it is a bit steep, especially for the size you get (equivalent to a tall at Starbucks), but they also use coconut, almond or soy milk at no extra charge. Only dairy free milk is available. Taste-wise, this was my first time getting a dirty Chai with coconut milk. I think the lack of dairy makes it less creamy and filing. I'm not sure if I like the coconut milk taste. I feel like it makes it a bit sour. Overall though, it's a cute cafe with some seating. If you're looking for some good vegan coffee options in the downtown Montreal area, this a good option."}
{"text":"I would give this Cafe between 3 to 4 stars in general. 4 because of the space. Although tiny, Leaves Cafe really maximizes it's space with small tables, bar seating along the side, and a beautifully minimal aesthetic. There is ample natural lighting and some exterior seating on the sidewalk. It is a great place to sit down and read a book on a lazy afternoon in downtown Montreal.   I would give it 2-3 stars for the coffee/food. This is a coffee store with a healthy range of drinks however they don't have any milk or dairy products because they aim to be cruelty free. While I don't mind being \"low impact\", I really do prefer my coffees, lattes etc with milk or cream in them. You have a choice of almond milk, coconut milk or soy milk. I was recommended the coconut milk as being closest to the real deal. They do take their time to give you a strong cup of joe by making it as a pour over, however I found the coffee to be quite acidic, possibly because there was no milk in it or maybe that was just the kind of bean they had.   Tip: there is wifi but I couldn't get it to work on my devices.   Overall, while I love the space, I can't quite get behind non-dairy coffee based drinks so I might return for a baked good or two but not for the coffee."}
{"text":"Tasty vegan snacks and drinks. There's a variety of different non-dairy mills for your drinks, personally, I like the coconut milk."}
{"text":"Très beau petit café avec ses divers cactus et plantes à vendre, ce qui explique pourquoi c'est l'un des cafés les plus Instagramable de Montréal. Bon service et personnel chaleurs. Le chocolat chaud est bon. Le seul hic de la place, est que c'est petit, donc il n'y a pas beaucoup de places quand tous les étudiants viennent étudier, mais c'est ce qui fait le charme de la place. Je conseille le Leaves Café!"}
{"text":"This cafe is so cute! I love the atmosphere here. The music that plays in the background is very chill. All of their drinks are vegan; they offer almond, soy or coconut milk. I got the matcha latte with almond milk. It came to $4.75 which is pretty typical for a latte. I sat and studied here; it's a bit drafty inside. The downside is that there isn't that much space. 15-20 people could fit in here, so if you get a spot to study congratulations! Their wifi works, but isn't super fast. Some pages won't load and the spinning wheel is frequent on Macs. Most people go in and out, so you'll be able to get a spot. They have different plants and cacti that decorate the walls and fairy lights strung across the ceiling. Bring a date or bring your laptop!  I was studying here for a bit too long and got hungry. I got their almond brioche and their baked goods are from Sophie Sucree! Except for a few things like their donuts! Pretty tasty and decently priced at $3!"}
{"text":"Un beau jour de printemps, ni trop chaud, ni trop froid, nous cherchions un lieu pour prendre un dernier café avant de rentrer chez nous. Ce lieu a attiré notre regard car 1- clairement ca n'était pas une chaîne, 2- la lumière du jour remplissait le café, 3- une petite table en devanture permettait de rester à l'extérieur profiter de la journée. En entrant nous avons été surpris par la quantité de cactus sur les étagères, certains en deco, d'autres a la vente. Beau decor qui donne envie de s'y arrêter. Du coup nous avons décidé de plutôt rester dedans pour profiter des plantes vertes. Le café propose des boissons chaudes et froides ainsi que des patisseries et biscuits, salades et wraps. Tout est végétalien. J'avais pas immédiatement remarqué car je ne cherchais pas forcément ce genre de régime mais quand j'ai commandé un matcha latte et qu'on m'a demandé 'quel lait', j'ai repondu 'bennnnn classique?'... et là on m'a pointé vers une liste de laits végétaux entre lesquels choisir. Donc j'ai testé lait de coco, c'était très bon, et même sans être végétalienne j'ai aimé ma boisson. Il y avait pleins de gâteaux sans gluten, et probablement aussi sans oeufs au final, mais moi ça m'a permis de choisir une collation alors j'étais très contente et mon 'browkie' était succulent! Nous y avons finalement passé 45 min a lire et nous reposer et on a passé un super moment!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! Very nice staff! Love their matcha. So peaceful and quiet. +Cute plants!"}
{"text":"Leaves café is a cute and worthwhile visit if you're looking for good quality bean juice!   I came here to grab a coffee and catch up with a friend. The interior is really small, but it has a cute charm. It can be a little hard to navigate, since its so narrow inside. There are little cups of cacti, which is a fun little part of the décor.   I ordered their chai tea latté with soy milk, and it was delicious. It was creamy, not overbearing sweet and the colour and latté art was beautiful. The service was quick, and I didn't have to wait long despite how busy it was. My latté came out to just under $5, which is average for a latté in Montréal.   Although there is bar seating and small tables, my friend and I took our drinks on the road.  Overall, I really enjoyed this café and WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK if I didn't live SO CLOSE TO PIKOLO.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Super cute café located in downtown Montreal! The decor is simple yet cute and it's quiet as well. Their matcha lattes are amazing (I recommend the matcha latte with coconut milk. SO GOOD) and the barista always takes time to make super pretty latte art! It's a vegan café too so for all you vegans out there (or non-vegans!) this is a must-try!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the aesthetics of this café: there are plants and cacti everywhere (which you can buy, by the way!). It felt small and cramped though, and it was a bit too loud to study. You probably shouldn't expect finding a place to sit down. I personally didn't think the coconut milk paired well with the acidity of their coffee, but soy milk was better. Prices are average for an indie coffee shop; I paid 5$ for a chai latte."}
{"text":"Delicious filter coffee!!! A lot of choices of vegan milk, great pastries, super cute space. My only complaint is the size of the bigger cup, I need me an even bigger morning coffee lol!"}
{"text":"I've actually walked by Leaves Cafe on De La Montagne many times before finally stepping in...to buy my Indie Cafe Passport. While I've initially dismissed it as just another third wave cafe, I was pleasantly surprised at how courteous the staff were.   Good: The cafe is a cute small spot that seats no more than 20 people at a time, with 2 baristas serving and maintain the place. I like that there's a little boutique wall that sells trendy cactus and succulent plants, as well as local handmade body care products. I've ordered a almond milk latte that was surprisingly really big and filling (I couldn't finish it), but it was pretty good! The barista later admitted to me that he was nervous making my latte because he saw my DSLR camera and knew he couldn't mess up my drink because he knew it was going to be photographed and posted on Instagram. I thought that was pretty funny, because HE WAS RIGHT.  Bad: Nay, I've had a pretty good experience here.  Bottom line: Definitely worth stopping by for a drink if you're in the downtown area. The cute little plants make this place so inviting. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe. Great staff! So nice. They make excellent matcha!!! Great quality. Yummy vegan desserts! I just absolutely love it!!"}
{"text":"Very cute vegan coffee shop! Friendly service and great \"insta worthy\" aesthetics (seriously, everybody I saw there took at least a few pics of the plants and drinks, some even stood up on their chairs for that flatlay). I had a chai latte with almond milk and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Such a unique spot in a great neighborhood.   Great vegan pastries, food and drink options. Very European feel to the place. A good spot to hang out drink and watch people.  Fun coffee shop. Love independently owned and operated shops and business and this one is no exception to my general rule.   Good selection of coffee and hot brews. The cappuccino was great. Very rich and well brewed. Almost felt I was back in Europe...  I also loved the customer service. Very personable and friendly.   I think this place is a great independent coffee shop in  the area."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. Not a whole lot of seating but if you're lucky enough to find a small table you will find a great selection of teas & coffees. There is also a nice assortment of pastries. It's very clean and nicely decorated. Would definitely stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"Café excellent, un plaisir d'aller au travail, je passe devant chaque jours et je continuerai à venir prendre mon café et de temps en temps mon petit plaisir sucre ;)  Je conseil vivement \"leaves café\""}

{"text":"This is my favourite café in Montreal. My friend brought me here on my second day in the city and now it's practically my second home. The vibe is social but relaxing. It's really comforting and calm- perfect for studying. The café itself is small but because of its size, it's really cozy. The drinks are all vegan which is perfect for me since I'm lactose intolerant. With the drinks, you can choose from a variety of plant-based milks, such as almond, soy, rice, coconut, etc. My favourite drink must be the matcha latte. I've always been a fan of matcha lattes but I've had difficulties finding the perfect lactose-free matcha latte. Leaves has the best matcha latte that I've ever had. I personally like it with almond milk. It gives it a sweet but also slightly bitter taste. The food/dessert are all delicious. My favourite is the feuilleté aux épinards. The texture is flakey on the outside and the filling is mouthwatering delicious. I think what makes leaves so unique is the wide variety of plants they have in their shop. They're all available for purchase. I bought a lily plant and a bamboo. They have a lot of cacti and other succulents. They also have a new loyalty card. You get a free food/drink after 6 purchases. Overall, their whole appearance is fresh and aesthetically pleasing. I highly suggest visiting Leaves."}
{"text":"So lovely! Used this place as an escape from a rainy afternoon after visiting the museum of fine arts. There are succulents and cactus everywhere and they lighten up the environment. Being a picky coffee drinker the Latte at Leaves did not disappoint. Recommend and would come back any time!"}
{"text":"I discovered this because of Yelp and I am glad that I did.  I almost missed it because it's a tiny spot!  There are only about 4-5 small tables inside and a few seats at the long table by the wall.  It's a vegan place that does their drinks and snacks well.  The service is really friendly as well.  I'm not a coffee drinker so I tried their Tisane tea and it was nice.  I also tried their spinach croissant and their almond croissant and wow...a perfect snack to get you through the day.  I especially loved the spinach one.  It tasted fresh and there was plenty of spinach in it - they certainly didn't skimp.  The crisp white against all the little greenery inside (small plants, flowers etc) make it totally pic worthy on IG.  It screams of modern cute.     I definitely will visit them again the next time I'm in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"It's a vegan coffeeshop which is great since I'm always looking for something new. You have the choice between 3 different milk (soy,almond or coconut). I highly recommend their matcha with any of their pastries! Their staff is excellent! They are super friendly and will try to help you choose if you never had coffee with those kind of milk."}
{"text":"Love this place! Go early to get a spot there if you're planning to study, really great vibes. The baristas are all super nice, and the coffee is wonderful! I had the cappuccino and the dirty chai, both of which I enjoyed. Also you can buy cacti here which is awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of those coffee shops you would expect to find on an episode of the show Girls. It caters to a young demographic that is trendy and urban. Great baked goods, coffee and friendly and bilingual service. It is very close to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and it has a modern, clean aesthetic. Not many tables but very homey and cool."}
{"text":"We went there a bit by accident, we were in the neighborhood, they have a excellent coffee, and all their pastries are vegan. We took a latté, two pastries, a kombucha and a cactus everything for 15$. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Charmant petit café situé sur une rue assez discrète du centre-ville de Montréal, Leaves Café est un établissement entière végane. Ici, aucun produit issu de l'exploitation animale n'est offert au menu (lait de vache, miel, etc.)! Lorsque vous commandez votre boisson, vous avez ainsi le choix entre 4 laits végétaux (amande, noix de coco, riz et soya). Au-delà des classiques comme le cappuccino et le latte, Leaves Café propose également d'autres boissons comme un matcha latte ou un dirty chaï (thé chaï avec un shot d'espresso). Si vous passez pendant les journées chaudes d'été, la plupart des items peuvent être commandés glacés. Des pâtisseries de Sophie Sucrée sont aussi disponibles. Évidemment, sans aucun produit d'origine animale non plus! Mon seul regret est que le café est petit et assez étroit. Il n'y a qu'une dizaine de places assises (et 2 de plus, à l'extérieur, pendant l'été). Par contre, la décoration est travaillée et soignée. Avec autant de lumière naturelle, de plantes et d'affiches sur le mode de vie végane, on se croirait tout droit sorti d'une photo Instagram! L'ambiance est calme et le personnel est sympathique et souriant. À noter que quelques produits de soin personnel, comme ceux de la marque montréalaise BKIND, sont aussi disponibles à l'achat. Il n'y a malheureusement pas (ou, plutôt, pas encore) beaucoup de cafés 100% véganes à Montréal. Leaves Café en est un et, si vous parvenez à obtenir une place assise pour travailler ou simplement relaxer, you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Cuuuuuuuuute café to hang out and study, quiet and neat even though it's close to downtown. The staff is really friendly and I really enjoy my time there! Their latte is pretty good but not the best, yet they sometimes have skilled latte master who can make really amazing figures (ex: My Neighbour Totoro), I will come back for that!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for coffee earlier this week and loved it. The cafe itself is super small and cute, but I loved the atmosphere. It's very narrow so it can be awkward when it's crowded. The service I received was excellent and the employee serving my friend and I was very kind and enthusiastic.   I enjoyed my coffee, and my friend said her latte was one of the best she's had. What I loved most is that they serve desserts from Sophie Sucrée, so there are several vegan and gluten-free options. Prices are a bit on the more expensive side, but nothing I wouldn't expect.   All in all, this is a nice place to come and enjoy a coffee with friends (if you find a seat) or study (again, if you find a seat)."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon passage à Leaves Cafe. Dès qu'on rentre dedans, on est comme apaisé, non pour vrai, le café est tranquille alors qu'on est en plein centre-ville. Je ne savais même pas qu'il était végétalien et j'ai apprécié le fait que ça ne soit pas revendiqué, que cela reste discret.   J'ai pris un chaï latté au lait de soya et un brownie sans gluten : EXCELLENT ! La musique était parfaite, la décoration épuré et simple était vraiment belle, le service à table et la fontaine d'eau n'est qu'un détail mais c'était vraiment apprécié. Les bas prix des cafés et thés m'ont étonnés, j'y retournerai sans hésiter !  Petite suggestion : Serait-il possible d'installer des porte-manteaux pendant l'hiver et de mettre des tables un petit peu plus grand ?"}
{"text":"It's a cute little cafe that also sells house plants! My friend Jules and I wanted a spontaneous adventure to Montreal last spring and so we hopped onto a bus of old art museum patrons and shuttled over to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. During our museum break, we wandered around the neighborhood to find a place to eat and we stumbled upon this lovely little cafe nearby. Because of my obsession with green tea I ordered a Matcha Latte and enjoyed it, all in my cute little to-go cup. I kind of wish I kept my cup for future repurposing but I guess I just have to come back to order something else. What was really striking was the shelf on the side that housed several potted plants and featured several Instagram photos. I really like this duality to the place. The plant shop obviously is referenced in the name, \"Leaves Cafe,\" and to build off that I feel like potted plants give the place a lovely and lively atmosphere. I'm enjoying new oxygen from the plants while also sipping on a warm latte. This place is definitely Insta-worthy, so come here if you want to feel like an artsy food photography blogger."}
{"text":"Last year, in a small space between fancy-pants shops on de la Montagne, a giant vegan cute bomb went off. Leaves Café emerged from the rubble and now we have coconut lattés and vegan croissants. Thank goodness.  Any drink you order gives you the option to use coconut, rice, soy and almond. Thus far I've ordered lattés with rice and coconut- both were steamed to perfection with well-rendered latté art. Cute cute cute. Even the staff is cute. There, I said it.  While I do like Sophie Sucrée, I also appreciate that Leaves features baked goods from other bakeries. It seems like the majority of spots that feature vegan baked goods are getting their stuff from SS which is great, but like, variety is nice.  I've never tried to sit and stay in Leaves, but I imagine it can be tough at times to wrestle up a spot in there. Maybe plan to take your coffee to go?"}
