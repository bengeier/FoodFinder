{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that focuses on one thing alone - tonkatsu.  They are very good at their specialty, not that soggy oily type.  Deep fried properly with good oil.  Try the fish or the pork with the broth.  Very delicious. Now, if you don't like fried food the obviously don't go, but if tonkatsu is your thing, then you must try this place (or the downtown location).  DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident as we were actually trying to grab a \"poke bowl.\" at a new restaurant that opened recently. Fortunately, they actually ran out of food for the day so after an impromptu stroll along Bloor St., we came across Mr. Tonkatsu!!!  (by the way ~ I'm writing about the Bloor Branch at 520 Bloor St, West, Toronto) Immediately, we were greeted by the courteous and attentive staff. Once seated, we were given a menu that offered all the Katsu a person can want!!! Being as it was my first time, I decided to try the basic signature dish: The Original Katsu Set (with a side of Soba ~ cold buckwheat noodles due to the hot weather). The food came very quickly. What most people talk about would be the sesame they present to you in a bowl for you to grind then add to the Katsu Sauce. I will not go into detail about that since it has been written about extensively by other yelpers. I will focus on the main dish itself. The succulent Katsu. Most poorly done Katsu are over-fried, dried or under / over-battered. The Katsu here was just perfect. Fried just right to be crispy but not dry, with the juices of the pork still intact. Not over or under-battered, battered just right and cooked just right (over-dry and still runny batter are the worst). You can taste the pork through the fried batter. The fried batter does not overtake the taste. Secondly, the sauce. The sauce accentuates the Katsu just right. In short, all elements of the dish compliments each other without overriding each other. End Result? Explosion of taste in your mouth!!! Notable mentions are: the house-made salad dressing, miso soup and the soba but come on, what we really want is MORE KATSU!!! Great place. Highly recommend it to all lovers of fried foods."}
{"text":"Mr Tonkatsu isn't fast food. Don't expect your meal to come quickly. We arrived at 1:50 pm, sat by the kitchen and figured that they turn out 2 tonkatsu orders every 5 mins or more. The resto isn't even busy but we waited 40 mins for our 2 pork tenderloin sets (@$13).   We're generally happy with the tonkatsu sets but found the pork tenderloin on the mushy side.  I'd say tender but mushy...  The batter is perfect though. Crispy, light and not greasy at all. Perhaps we'll try a different cut of pork or go with chicken next time.  Miso soup, salad and rice are all refillable at no charge.   Service is good. May take long to be checked in since the reception area also processes payment. Pay there on your way out.  Credit card accepted.   Even though they were supposed to stay open till 9 pm, they were completely sold out by 2:45 pm and began turning down new customers. When you see the 'Sold Out. Sorry' sign on the front door, you're out of luck."}
{"text":"They do take reservations over the phone. Not too busy on a Wednesday evening but very limited parking. The curry, the fish, the crispy chicken wings and the pork tenderloin were all amazing! The seats weren't comfortable and food came out pretty slow but the good food and friendly service made up for it!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times, service was ok  Tried their chicken katsu - it was great!  Not a fan of the cheese in the middle tho, it gets too heavy half way into the meal.  Definitely a go to place on a week night for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I stumble upon this restaurant due to a friends birthday. I liked the novelty activity where you have to grind your own sesame seed powder. It is a good time kill while you wait for the food. I ordered the pork loin and i think quality of the meat was quite good. It was tender and moist. However the overall experience is nothing special. Maybe because they stick to classic katsudon format where you get fried meat, rice and some  vegetables. I didn't find it to be social. It felt like I could get the same thing in other Japanese establishments. For this reason it's a 3 star for me. If you are looking for something new then this won't make the cut but if you want the a katsudon with quality meat then this would be it."}
{"text":"Their food is great. Service is good. But parking is beyond complication. You might think they have a huge parking. But no. They are gonna ask you to move your car from the parking and go all the way around the building to park while you eat."}
{"text":"I always had a crush on all things deep fried, and Mr. Tonkatsu just happened to open near my neighbourhood!   I've been here a couple of times, and compared to my first visit, the hype has certainly died down and the queue for a table is not as monstrous. We were seated within 5 minutes last time I visited!   I always order the same thing - Pork Cutlet with Cheese, served with soba. The gooey cheese that oozes out of each piece makes a great instagram photo AND tastes bomb! To share, I suggest the crispy chicken (they are amazing). I always leave stuffed and craving for more within a few days.   I can't speak for their downtown location, but I'm a fan of this place. Service is also quick and very friendly! Call me a regular!"}
{"text":"I went for tonkatsu donburi with soba. The bad: soba and donburi. Soba noodle was too overcooked and donburi had no sauce in it. It was literally tonkatsu on a bed of cooked rice. The good: They served the tenderest and juiciest tonkatsu I've tried in Toronto and I wished I had more. Great decor and service also contributed to 4-star rating. I would definitely come back, but probably for dishes not involving donburi and soba."}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in Japanese-style pork katsu with miso soup, cabbage salad and rice. Unfortunately, they do not meet the quality standards of good Japanese food. The miso soup tasted watered down and the pork cutlets were thin slices with mostly batter. Wanted very much to like this place, but quite disappointed.   note: only 3 parking spots for the entire restaurant available. Other spots reserved for Mr.Meat next door."}
{"text":"I like the North York location quite a bit more than The Annex one.  Though you can expect the same panko-crusted, fried, meaty goodness at both locations, Mr. Tonkatsu on Yonge has really friendly service and comfier (though some are still communal) seating.  Well durrrrr L, you may say.  It's brand new.  I know, I know.  But even the food somehow tastes better.  The pork cutlet is decently sized, and though I think the pork tenderloin has less fat than the regular pork loin, the tenderloin is softer.  In either case, the meat is moist and flavourful, with a substantially crispy outer crust.  Dipped in the ground sesame & tonkatsu sauce mixture, it's almost as satisfying to eat as it was to mash up the sesame seeds in the olden-timey mortar & pestle.  I say \"almost\", because when grinding it up I can pretend I'm Hermione or Snape, preparing a potion.  Whereas eating pork; well, that's just eating pork.  Service was really nice and friendly.  The lady at the cash offered my partner and I  free beverages on the house after another couple awkwardly sat beside each other at the 4-person communal table and refused to move (or sit across each other).  We didn't take her up on the offer, but it was nice of her anyway.  Unfortunately, there's no real way to avoid these awkward seating arrangements or additional wait for a lone table unless you want to continue waiting upwards of the minimum 1 hour queue.  The only suggestion I might make is to avoid the rush hours of 6-8pm, although you will likely still have a bit of wait around 8:30pm. I'd still do it again..."}
{"text":"It was Yelp who notified me there's a hot and new restaurant. I am thinking Yelp's suggestion shouldn't be too bad and so I gave it a try. I am attracted to the decoration inside the restaurant. The decor and the interior design of the restaurant is so nice. I can hardly to keep my camera down, especially with the new camera feature provided by Yelp. It makes photo taking much easier. I ordered a Pork Tenderloin Katsu Curry.   When the order arrives, it looks BIG!! Salad and a bowl of soup came together with the katsu, deep fried pork tenderloin. The outer layer of the pork tenderloin is crispy and yet not too greasy. The bite of the tenderloin is tender and soft and juicy. As well, the meat is marinated well. The katsu tastes phenomenon!! The curry is slightly spicy. It goes well with the rice. YES! It has to be rice! Rice and curry are a perfect couple. In my personal opinion, a cold beer may be a nice beverage to eat with the curry and rice.   The only drawback is this restaurant closes at 1:00 pm on Sunday. Without knowing the early closing time, I arrived at the restaurant at about 12:00. There's only slightly less than an hour to enjoy my meal. BUT, the experience is AWESOME!! I want to lick my plate at the end. I would bring my friends with me in my next visit."}
{"text":"Nothing special. But chicken and pork was fried nicely that insides weren't dried but I still wouldn't return. Food took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"I had never been here before.  Apparently, this place was called Mr. Tonkatsu before.  So, I walk in and the first thing they asked me was to move my car from where I parked it because the next door business would always complain.  There are only so many parking spots, and the neighbours don't apprecite cars taking the parking spots that supposedly belong to them.  Not a pleasant experience.  But the food was good.  I ordered a spicy Chicken Katsu.  I would return again.  A bit pricy at $16+tax, but then again, everywhere is getting expensive.  It was spicy, but not as hot as I expected it. It was a type of breaded chicken with a red spicy sauce, fried rice and a pickled salad.   C.L."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Saw others who instagramed about it and had to try. Breading was light and flakey, they said it was made in house. Got the set meal pork katsu. They offered free refills of miso soup and cabbage side. They bring little bowls of sesame seeds to crush and add to the sauce. I would return!"}
{"text":"We were a party of two and came here on a Saturday for lunch, we lucked out with parking as the parking lot is quite small. We arrived shortly after 12 pm and we were seated right away as a party of two had just left.  We were looking forward to trying the pork/chicken katsu with cheese but they didn't have cheese that day so we opt for the chicken katsu curry and honey butter chicken.  The honey butter chicken came in large portions and was quite good. The curry was average but nothing too amazing.  Will come back to try the katsu with cheese someday."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Quick service (after lunch) tasty curry katsu. Good price, will be back."}
{"text":"The owner promptly followed up with this issue and fully took ownership of the case. He recognized that his staffs delivered the wrong order. In an effort to resolve this issue, the owner offered me the choice of  (1) full refund; or (2) inviting my family to visit the restaurant again. I am very pleased with the way how the situation was handled. I would pay this restaurant another visit sometime in the future.   **issue resolved**  I got chicken karagge wings, charged me $15 + tax and thought I would get a decent portion, not seven pieces."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very generous portions. We ordered pork loin katsu with cheese, chicken cheese katsu with demi glaze, and fish katsu. My favourite was the pork loin katsu with cheese. The cheese was well-melted but still a little chewy, so it enhanced the already great texture combination. Their katsus were not oily and I love the crunch from the panko. Their decor is definitely a bonus. The only downside is their prices, it's definitely on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of pork Katsu, but this place just disappointed me. I ordered pork tenderloin Katsu and my boyfriend ordered the one with cheese. The rice was too wet, the pork was alright but not juicy and the sauce was too sour. Btw, do not order pork loin with cheese."}
{"text":"I ordered Pork Lion with Cheese set. Order came quick maybe because it was not at lunch time. Cheese in the pork was kind of heavy but the pork katsu was very crispy and not oily. Will try curry pork katsu next time. :)"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and unsurprisingly, it was really busy on a Friday evening. The menu is simple so it's easy to choose but space is a bit cramped. I can imagine in the winter, there will be space issues when everyone had a winter jacket.   I order the beef katsu set and my friend got the chick curry katsu. Both we're really yummy and we pretty much shared each others food since it was both really good.   This places charges for tea though, just a head up. Also, the wait for food can be really long when it's busy. There is also a small parking lot right outside..a VERY small parking lot. There's also no wifi...:(  Although the food was good, I feel like it is over priced. $16 for a plate of chicken curry is just too much."}
{"text":"This new Mr.Tonkatsu location is one block north of Yonge/Cummer, on the west side of Yonge. Parking is limited, but there are more parking in the plaza across the road. The restuarant has a nice wooden decor. I recommend the pork loin combo, which came with a rice, tonkatsu, lettuce salad, miso soup, and tonkatsu dipping sauce. You also get some seasame as topping. The pork loin combo was around $12 and it is relatively filling for me. The interior was juicy and the outside was nice and crispy. It reminded me of a katsu don I had in Tokyo. Anyways, the biggest issue (as pointed out by the other reviewers) is that the food takes forever to come out. I waited approximately 30 minutes from ordering to getting the first part of my order. Maybe I should not have expected tonkatsu meals to be fast food, as it is in Japan. Maybe if I went in with a mindset that Mr. Tonkatsu is more like a whitecloth French restuarant, maybe then I would have been ok with the wait."}
{"text":"I would advise making reservations at this place. It's small and popular location with very limited parking space. I did like the interior design. It gave a comfortable hipster feel with the decor and atmosphere in general.Staff was friendly and would stop by to refill our waters and tonkatsu sauce.   We started dinner with calamari (squid) and karaage chicken wings as an appetizer. The calamari was the biggest I've ever seen, mainly from the bread crumbs making it look bigger than it actually is. Not to say this was a bad thing, but what I found was how they prepared it to be very unique. It was nice and flaky as you bit into it. The way they prepared it gave almost a cushioning effect around the squid. Very nice, I like! For the karaafe chicken, it was crispy, hot, and juicy. Nothing to improve on this!   I ordered the pork tenderloin katsu with soba. Again, there's something about the way they breaded the katsu. The flaky texture was something I wasn't use to since the katsu's I've had in the past were normally jam packed. This was a pleasant change. There was plenty of meat in it as well and was cooked to a nice warm temperature. The soba was served warmed in a broth that tasted similar to miso soup. Cabbage was also served, but not much to say about it other than it was large and we were provided with some kind of dressing. The dressing was like the  thousand island dressing but more balsamic and vinegar taste to it.   The unique thing about this place is that we were provided with sesame seeds with mortar and pestle. This helped kill some time while they were prepping out food. Crushed it up to put into the tonkatsu sauce.  Overall, I would recommend checking this place out if you like eating Tonkatsu."}
{"text":"My new favourite guilty pleasure place. I got the Pork Loin with Cheese. It was cheesy, crispy, and delicious. I digged the sesame dressing you get to pour over your cabbage salad (which is limitless, btw), and I also liked grinding my own sesame seeds for the tonkatsu sauce. Not sure if the grinding actually made the sauce taste better, since the flavor of the sesame dressing is pretty strong with the sesame flavour, but anyway.  I ended up getting the extra meat for another $8 because I'm a fattie. But I think it's more worth than getting the curry katsu. Or maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"I live 1 street away from Mr. Tonkatsu. I have been watching the construction and the cute maskot definately interest me. I have been wanting to try but the line has always been long and the limited parking spot doesnt help. I finally tried it during low time. They served single packaged green tea, which my wife loved. I love curry katsu so i decided to try it. It was delicious! It could be better if it has more parking option and if it has double door. It was so cold when a lot of people comes in & out if you sit next to the door. Price was a bit too pricy to my tasting"}
{"text":"I liked the warm wooden tone interior when walked in. But the seating aren't that spacious. And parking is limited (like 4 spots?).   Ordered Curry pork cutlet - good size and batter very crispy. But curry sauce was a okay. 3.5/5 And also Pork cutlet Don (over rice) with soba combo - did not expect the soba to be warm lolll very mild flavour.  Cutlet portion was very small :(  Topped with poached egg. Cool.  3/5 Service was good 4/5  Not too sure if worth return. Maybe one more try."}
{"text":"A big hell yes I like this place.  Get to know me well enough and you'll soon learn that fried chicken is an integral part of my being.  Perhaps it ranks right up there with bacon or steak but whatever it's my favorite way of having this meat cooked, period.  Mr Tonkatsu is visually squeezed into a corner near the intersection of Patricia and Yonge on the west side beside a butcher place that has enough room inside their store to open another entire store.  Regardless it's cozy inside and it has an earthy feel to it probably because of all the wood everywhere.  I sat facing the wall but I had been facing a textured wall and the decor was not simply sterile.  What caught my eye was on a wooden weave type wall I caught some words on the strips and one of them was \"SEOUL\".    The menu was pretty simple to follow.  It's a single laminated sheet with no photos but everything if you know what it is - is pretty straight forward.  There are simple descriptions and our server explained anything that wasn't clear.  We had shared several types of fried chicken:  plain karaage chicken wings (8 or so to the serving), honey butter \"sprinkled\" chicken thigh boneless and sweet chicken thigh karaage (sauced).  What a great mix of styles and flavors!    The plain wings were basically just battered wings, thicker batter than what I'm used to seeing with Korean style fried chicken but still tasty and crunchy.  The wings were well cooked and not watery.  The honey butter sprinkled boneless chicken was amazing.  It was more of a tempura style batter, light and covered in a sweet butter type spice almost like a popcorn type topping.  The pile on this serving plate was rather high and the taste and look almost reminded me of something you would see at a carnival kind of like elephant ears but no, it's fried chicken!  Boneless thigh give good pieces of chicken and some pieces were long and thin but the batter and flavoring really made it something special.  Last but not least the sauced \"popcorn\" style battered chicken was good and while a little sweet for me it was still complimentary to the other styles we had.  One thing I'm not too fond of is when sauce makes the chicken lose it's crunch but still it adds flavor and changes the texture a bit so not everything is all crunchy and dry.  For my main I had ordered a chicken katsu set which includes cabbage, rice and miso soup.  The katsu came on a small cookie cooler type tray so by staying elevated it didn't sit in grease.  Before that they had given me a pestle and mortar type thing so I could crush my own sesame seeds to mix with my sauce.  I had no idea what to do with it until I asked someone what it was for.  The chicken was thin, crispy and panko golden breaded.  It was a good dish for only 14 dollars and the sides (rice, soup, cabbage) are in unlimited quantities.  I ended up asking for more rice and soup afterwards.  It seems at least for now that this establishment doesn't have their liquor license so beer wasn't to be had which was fine.  I don't always need to drink beer with chicken although I do enjoy it once in a while.  Overall the place is good and I would return.  There is another location on Bloor in Koreatown and I may very well check that out as well."}
{"text":"I was there on a weeknight, and all the tables were full. But we got seated right away. I really liked the wooden furniture, and the industrial look. Although there was a lingering smell of oil in the air - which I understand based on the menu.   I tried the karage chicken thigh - both sweet and spicy sauce. The spicy sauce was my favourite, but NOTE:: It IS actually spicy. I'd definitely go back for this. I think I also had the katsudon with soba. It was good... but it tasted like the oil has been used for a while. Not my favourite, but I am interested in trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The tonkatsu here is amazing! Batter is crispy and light without being greasy. I get the classic set with pork katsu. For $12 you get a fair portion of meat and rice/salad/soup are refillable for free. You definitely get your fill.  Their special sauce is addicting. Do follow the instructions to grind the sesame seeds and add them to the sauce. It's super tasty.  The place is very small and may not be the best for groups to just walk in. Call ahead and make reservations if there's more than 4 in your group."}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing this place on yelps hot and new.    Expected sushi and the offerings I saw in the images but was surprised there was no sushi.    I was impressed, simple clean place , will be too small for when they get busy after the lcbo license comes.    We all had the special pork or chicken cutlet with salad miso and rice.   A few appetizers tried were shrimp and chicken.  Chicken was a little greasy and was the thigh so wasn't great.    The food was great, service was good and payment at end was decent conversation around the place being only 2 months old and ensured I enjoyed ourselves.     I will definitely go to this place again and recommend it.   Was much different than other Asian offerings.     Btw we were the only non Asians there but which makes me feel like it's a good offering."}
{"text":"Went in without expectations considering the meek exterior. seating is sparse and strange. youre sitting on wood crates without any back support. decor is nice.  the menu is short with karaage, tonkatsu, curry and don buri options. had the karaage don buri which tasted great but very small amount of karaage (3pcs)! the curry tonkatsu was delicious. the curry sauce was the highlight. for two people $40 without drinks and apps, left a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5  Craving us something deep-fried, so we figured we'll give this place a go.  Wifey had the pork cutlet with cheese. Comes with miso, salad, and rice. Portion was big enough to share with the hubby. Batter was so light and flaky. It was excellent and thoroughly enjoyed by both. It's a cutlet with a twist! Hubby got chicken Kaarage. Portion was huge, definitely for sharing. Quality just average but still satisfying.  Side note: staff were amazing and very polite!"}
{"text":"Had the pork curry tonkatsu. The tonkatsu okay fried nicely, and the meat was not dried out by frying. But the curry was not especially flavourful. The meal was also rather pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Not too bad..however as a previous poster stated, the soba was a definite miss. It was soggy and bland...I'd not order again.  We all had the pork tenderlion and found it pretty juicy, but thinner than what we have expected for the price.   Parking was hard also, as there were only 3 parking spots that belongs to Mr Tonkatsu.  The friendly and cute korean waiters were....A-OK too! LOL"}
{"text":"Summary: good food, ridiculous parking/seating arrangements, probably too pricey.  I ordered the pork loin katsu with soba, which came with a cabbage slaw, miso soup, and the sesame seeds with mortar and pestle. The soba broth was lukewarm and a little watery, but it tasted good, as did the noodles. The katsu was delicious and crispy - great breading - and I loved the sauce. That meal plus a diet coke and a katsudon with miso to go was around $30, which I felt was a bit much for the quantity that was served. It wasn't outrageous by any means, but did feel a smidge overpriced.  There is a small parking lot, but most of it is reserved for customers of the neighboring store. There is actually a sign on the restaurant door stating that reserved spots are tow-away zones. We ended up squeezing into the back/side of the lot.  The seating was weird. In the restaurant, there is a high table with maybe 6 chairs, a bar-like counter with 4 stools, and some regular-height wooden tables for two - maybe 4 of those. The most comfortable place to sit is probably the small wooden tables, but those are basically communal. Our party of two was basically sitting on top of the neighboring two top. Also, a four top had just left and it took quite a while for the table to be bussed.  Overall, I might get take-out but I would probably not visit again."}
{"text":"The place was a bit hard to find at night, the black sign and no lights on it. there is some parking in the front but only about 3 spots? the service is attentive and food comes pretty quick. I think it's a bit overpriced for the size/portion.  the food is ok, nothing special.  tried the signature tongkatsu, a bit dry and needs to dip it in a lot of that sauce, the cabbage salad is tasteless.  the katsu don was super small."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner, waited for approx 20 minutes, right when we order we were told that they ran out of cheese. So we ordered the curry pork cutlet. It is approx $14 and taste like ordinary fried pork... Nothing special about the place and with this price, probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"2.7/5 Not impressed at all..  This place is charging their food for quality level restaurants. Unfortunately, Mr. Tonkatsu couldn't deliver the quality food nor service but the chubby bills.   I ordered cheese stuffed pork loin tonkatsu with soba, chicken tights and curry chicken tonkatsu. I received a small bowl of very sad old hot soba which I can only imagine to receive in independent k style Japanese restaurants as a compliment dish, A-okay cheese stuffed thin pork loin tonkatsu, over seasoned chicken tights that's no special and very water downed barely no-curry curry chicken tonkatsu. Both main dishes came with a scoop of sad and old rice and fresh but asian cafeteria style salad. I got a lot to say about what I received but the curry chicken tonkatsu was the top notch. I mean..  How can you call it a curry dish if there is not enough of curry to even finish the half of dish? And charges extra for little scoop of curry?? They better change the name of the dish into chicken tonkatsu with a hint of curry flavoured sauce. And you called that as a soba and charge that much ? I mean come on! That tiny bowl of soggy over cooked soba must been swimming in that soup for entire day! I was seriously considering maybe they don't know what real soba is ..   Ok, let's say these guys aren't really specialized in Japanese food but Japanese style korean food. I had tonkatsu in both countries and I can say they served better food for cheaper than this place.  And the service? Where is the service? They should just install an ordering machine on the table because there was no service what so ever! Servers don't know anything about their food but just want to abandon the customers so they can chat with each others. I had to grab a busser to get help. And this restaurant is tiny and there were only 4 soon to leave tables at the moment!   Everything was disappointing except using fresh meat even tho it was fairly thin and tonkatsues still have decent crunchness outside and moist inside. I was quite impressed with that, but it wasn't good enough to call themself a tonkatsu specialist.   I would give them a 3.2 star if their price tag was any cheaper but I don't think that's going to happen.   Definitely not coming back unless if they make a huge changes."}
{"text":"The Tonkatsu breading is extra crispy. The sauce is very strong so just use a little. Cabbage salad is a weird pairing to have with Tonkatsu. The Japanese rice is perfect. A lettuce salad would be better with a lighter dressing. Maybe some pickles on the side. Everything packed to go. A little pricey. I spent $18 for one Tonkatsu dinner and a Gingerale."}
{"text":"Very limited parking spaces. 3 for the entire restaurant. Japanese decor was clean and organized. Courteous service. Very prompt on business hours.   Had the curry pork cutlet. Meat was a little on the dry side. Panko layer was crispy and not too oily. Japanese curry was tasty and a nice compliment to the dish, but luke warm. Salad on the side was a nice balance to the fried pork cutlet, but nothing fancy. They never asked if we wanted a refill of soup/salad. Water was refilled once upon request only when the bill was presented.   Fair value. Not a must go, but a relaxed meal if you're looking for something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Passed by this newly opened restaurant, googled that there's one in downtown, and decided the try it out.  The food is fair, nothing special.  If you order the standard meal,  you can have free refills of shredded cabbage, rice and miso soup.  The rice was a bit cold and hard; miso soup was good tho, not the cheap instant one but real ones with bunch of seaweed.   I ordered chicken cutlet  and I found it's a bit too soft, even a bit mushy on the inside, batter was good tho.   BF ordered pork cutlet with cheese  inside, pretty good - hot meat with stringy cheese.   However, a few of the staff weren't very fluent in English and got our orders wrong (couple times. e.g. mixing up with cheese vs no cheese, soba combo vs  regular combo).  Although they tried to remedy by remaking the order and offering free pop, it just took too long for the order to get ready . Not a good place to visit if you're very hungry or in a hurry.  Probably won't have it again as I've had cheaper and better pork cutlet somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular chicken katsu set, and let me just say I was very satisfied. Chicken was nice and crispy but still juicy on the inside. Grinding our own sesame was fun and tasted good with ththe sauce provided. I don't remember how much it was because it was a while ago but it was worth it since I didn't feel any regrets afterwards! Recommend this place if you're in the area or if you're craving a nice delicious cripsy goodness  Customer service was great, food was served to us fast and everybody was friendly even when we asked for another bowl of rice"}
{"text":"Since so many people had been mentioning about this place I had to go try it for myself. When it comes to Katsu i'm a pretty big fan and Mr. Tonkatsu is now one of my most favorite place to get Katsu.    The customer service there is really great. All the servers are all very nice and service is very quick. The portion is good decent size and the katsu is sliced into fairly large pieces, larger than other places. The katsu is their specialty and I can definitely say they do it right.   The katsu is very nicely breaded and not overpowering and once biting in a piece it's crispy and tender. After trying the chicken curry katsu and pork loin katsu both were delicious.   Price is a little steep in terms of buying katsu but I can see that this place is different compared to others in terms of the quality. So the price is for more quality instead of cheap. Overall, big fan of this upcoming location and forward in coming again. Plus they have very cute and good looking waitresses working there as well ;) Makes the whole experience better when you have eye candy and good food =)"}
{"text":"When I went there on a Saturday evening around 6:00pm, the place was pretty packed. I didn't have to wait for a seat (5~mins). However, I did have to wait 55 mins for my food. The food was good but not great.  It was nothing special; and definitely not worth the wait. We ordered two Cheese pork cutlets but they told us 35 mins after receiving the order that they are sold out. I would not visit again."}
{"text":"This place is not called Mr. Tonkastsu anymore. It's now call Katsuya. Different menu:"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat alot of katsu but my wife and I decided to give Mr. Tonkatsu a try since it just opened, and we're glad we did.   The tricky thing with katsu is it can get quickly overwhelming and make you feel sick if not done properly. There were no such problems with Mr. T, as it does its katsu really well. We got: - Shrimp appetizer: Good, though I was kinda hoping to find a non-fried appetizer on the menu to balance out the taste of the main meals.  - Pork loin katsu: Fried really well, not overly oily, just the right amount of thickness for the panko bread crumbs so the ratio between coating and meat was spot-on. This dish also comes with unlimited rice and soup. Side cabbage salad was standard. - Chicken katsu with cheese and demi glace sauce: Same comments on how well the katsu was done. This had the added bonus of cheese (generous serving so it oozed out as I made my way through the chicken cuts) and demi glace sauce (couldn't quite make out what it tasted like, but get this if you like things on the sweeter side). Would come back for this dish.  Overall, a good meal (and this is coming from someone who isn't in love with katsu). A bit pricey (~$20/person) though servings are big (a meal can serve 2 not-so-hungry people). Place is also spacious, good lighting, and you don't leave smelling of the food. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing and the food, delicious! I shared the pork loin and karaage chicken thighs. The portions were huge. I was going to order a side of rice for the karaage when one of the waiters stopped to remind me that I get unlimited rice and miso soup. That was definitely a plus in service in my books. I appreciate when honest business is done. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch. Food was not spectacular, but still good. The service was really nice. The girl helping my friend and I was very kind and helpful. I don't know if they have a full bar. We ordered beers, so I know they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Haven't had tonkatsu since I came back from Japan, so I was craving some of that fried goodness. Mr. Tonkatsu delivered. We went for the pork tenderloin Katsu and the honey butter fried chicken both of which were fried perfectly. Love that the rice, salad and miso soup were all unlimited. It was way more food than what we could finish, so we ended up packing some to go. Service was a tad slower than I had liked but overall the service was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great interior, great food, great servers. I tried their tender loin Katsu,Demi-Glass Katsu, katsudon, soba, soy chicken and all of them are good! and the price was reasonable for such high quality food. I will definitely go here again and recommend to my friends and families. I've been to Katsuya but I can't compare this place to Katsuya! Much better Katsu, better sauce, there's nothing to compare. Overall, I'd give 6 stars out of 5!"}
{"text":"This place actually reminds me of the really good curry I had when I visited Japan!!! The fried pork loin is super crispy and tender, it's so delicious! And the soba is very good as well. You also get to grind your own sesame seeds while u wait for your food which is kinda fun hahaha passes the time"}
{"text":"Cheese pork loin 3.5/5 Sweet chicken thigh 3/5 Overall experience 3/5  Bottom line: good but not the best value. I tried both the katsu with and without cheese. With cheese it's above average, tender and not dried out. Without cheese, the katsu is very average. At the price point of around $12-$15, the quality is similar to some take out places I've had (under $10).   The wooden interior of the restaurant is clean and simplistic but the stools were quite uncomfortable - also impracticable with a jacket and a purse.   The wait for the food was around 15-20minutes on a busy weekend afternoon. The service was attentive but overall nothing special."}
{"text":"I love this place back in Korea town , I still love this branch in Yonge and Sheppard. Newly opened , this place is much lighter in decor over their KTown branch.   The food is the exactly the same goodness with every bite of my Pork Tenderloin Katsu. As the name suggests this is definitely tender . The meat was cooked just right with still enough moisture for my palate but reduced to keep the bread crumbs from being soggy. They grind their own crumbs from loaves of bread, which tells me they dont squint on quality. One serving is good to keep one person full and probably a child. They have th option to add extra meat, that is enough to share for two full grown adult. I was lucky that I had friends who had good taste order other dishes  and I got to sample theirs . They were all equally well prepared. Portions just as much to accommodate one person with a little left over . Among ordered were the Karaage wings (warning :some spicy tolerable heat ) , Cheese Loin with Curry Sauce , Chicken  with Demi Glace (sweeter sauce) .   Service was very good and accommodating , we can attest to this as we can be quite handful with requests. Parking on the streets starts at 6pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"After a month of anticipation, Mr Tonkatsu North York finally opened!! A definite must try! It's a very small restaurant! Special thanks to a friend of mine who constantly  call to find out when they were open and managed to secure a table for Friday night for 4 pax for 7pm!   We ordered four sets of Pork Tenderloin Katsu, Chicken Katsu, Pork Loin with cheese Katsu and fish Katsu plus the Karage chicken thigh!  All sets comes with rice, salad and miso soup!  The Karage is definitely a must-try! Will definite come back to have the Pork tenderloin Katsu and chicken Katsu again! I like how they use chicken breasts white meat on their chicken Katsu! The Karage was nice and juicy! The Pork Loin with cheese Katsu was yummy and definitely very mozzarella cheesy indeed! My fave is still the Pork Tenderloin Katsu! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Amidst the slew of Korean restaurants in Toronto's Korea Town, Mr. Tonkatsu branches out into authentic Japanese cutlets worthy of the lively neighbourhood it resides in.  Their Tonkatsu is thoroughly breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried to perfection. This crunch is different from Western fried foods - it's very light and doesn't make you feel heavy in the stomach (unless.... you eat a lot of it...). If you get their traditional Katsu plate, they give you a grooved bowl with sesame seeds that you can grind up and dump into the Tonkatsu sauce for that nice, complimentary nuttiness.  You can also get it with Japanese curry and rice instead, if you're feeling saucy. The curry sauce is savoury and is THE best with rice.  Whatever your choose, either or gives you an amazing Katsu experience."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place and how amazing the Katsu is here. So, I finally decided to  check it out and imo, it was alright.  First off, take a seat at the lower tables(if possible) as it provides a more comfortable experience. I was seated at one of the higher tables and throughout my meal, I had to balance myself on a wobbly stool and found myself to straighten my back every so often..   As for the food.. Nothing really special in taste in imo. I ordered the Pork Loin Katsu as many Yelpers have recommended. Like many have said, it's nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Flavour fell short on the Katus as I expected some wine/soju flavour in the meat like the other katsus I've tried. Well, atleast the sauce kind of saved it... Besides the Katsu it also comes with salad, miso soup, rice and a bowl of sesame seeds. Rice is just rice and the salad is just raw veges; that's probably the only description I can give. I really enjoyed the sesame seeds though. While mashing it, you can smell its aroma. It definitely gave it a kick to the dipping sauce and rice. Miso soup could've be served hotter as I found it to be just warm. It's not bad of a deal, all for $12.. Service was prompt; very warm and friendly environment and food came within 10mins after ordering.  Can't really say much since I've only been here once but as for this one experience, I'd give this a 3 A-OK. I would like to come back and try their curry though and other Katsu. So, will update once I revisit!"}
{"text":"I was on the way home from work and I was so hungry.  The big sign on the wall with a picture of a pig holding a knife/sword was what made me decide to try Mr. Tonkatsu out.  I ordered the pork loin tonkatsu (comes with cabbage salad, miso soup, tonkatsu sauce and rice).  I was amazed that the server gave me sesame seeds to crush so that I can use it to put on my green tea or pork loin tonkatsu.   Cabbage salad is just salad but I loved that salad dressing they had for it.  The Miso soup did not taste as if it was microwaved and rice is just rice .  So when I tried the pork loin tonkatsu it was pretty good.  It was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I had a good meal and the portion size was decent but kinda small for $16.00 that is including my green tea.  The service was ok but the staff did not check up on me and ask if everything was going well.  Although the waitress who brought me food apologized for the wait for my food (8 minutes).  I kind of felt ignored but there were 3 families in the restaurant.  So will be returning to Mr. Tonkatsu?  The answer is no.  It didn't really make a good impression on me.  You can get cheaper tonkatsu meal options at Japanese restaurants. The only thing I liked was the plating and the decor at the restaurant.  I mean it doesn't hurt to try it out but I thought I would just share my opinion .  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I was first drawn to this place with a very cute pig sign at the door. Parking is limited, so I would recommend either going during off hours or even try to find street parking. You actually enter the small intersection before the building. They are beside a very interesting mr.meat that looks like they sell very classy meat. Though I never been and will plan to go in the near future.   Let's start with the great take out presentation that nicely divides the rice, cabbage and meat. There is plenty of meat in a nice tender flaky coating and the rice is cooked to perfection. This was probably the best tonkatsu I have had. However, a low point would be the cabbage that could be spruced up. Overall, great food!"}
{"text":"Fresh hot deep fried pork katsu, I loved it. Friend thought there's too breaded though. Love the sauce and soup as well. Very few seating though. Reservation recommended."}
{"text":"On a recent Toronto visit I went to Mr. Tonkaksu, which is nice addition to the Asian food mix along the east side of Yonge Street in the Greenfield to Spring Garden food block. I had the pork with cheese Katsu meal, which was lightly fried with just the right amount of batter.  We noticed the bread loaves behind the the counter, which they explained they baked on site to be used  in making their batter mix. I also added the soba noodles for $4, which came out nice and hot. My wife was not as hungry and just ordered the Japanese Don Buri, which turned out to have a lot of food in the bowl with some great seasoning (see picture). Overall for $33 we thought the meal was tasty and good value.  The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is the new very modern decor is bright.  I'm used to Katsu places in NYC, which usually have lower lighting, which encourages the patrons to stay longer and have a beer.  If they installed a light dimmer the atmosphere would be perfect."}
{"text":"Like it's downtown branch, this Mr. Tonkatsu shares the similar artwork, nice service, long listed menu and quality katsu dishes. I had the katsudon and soba combo. Both bowls were somewhat filling, and I'd definitely come back to try other dishes. I wouldn't recommend bringing more than 4 people in a group because of the small size though. Getting there by TTC is convenient but if you're driving, then parking may be very limited if during busy hours."}
{"text":"So I came here for some takeout lunch.    Ordered some crispy chicken thighs and a side of cabbage.    I was gonna wait standing up, but the nice lady offered me a seat at a table... I got there around 11:30am and the place was pretty quiet, so I sat down.  Then I waited and waited and waited... the place started to fill-up... Then I got booted out of my seat for some sit down customers and was asked to wait at another seat... Then I waited and waited... then some more people came in and I got booted out of my seat again and was asked to stand.  :(  The lady was apologetic about it though...     Food came out shortly after that.  Took it back to the office which was about a 10 min walk and opened it up.  What I found was the most juicy, crispy, perfectly seasoned fried chicken that I've ever had.  God, that satisfying crunch on every bite... And this is after it was sitting in the box!  Seriously... This chicken defies science.  I damn near forgot about the Popeye's that just opened up in the area... damn near.    The cabbage on the other hand was just that.  Sliced thin... Cabbage... No dressing... no seasoning... just... cabbage... I mean... I guess that's what I ordered?  But... I don't know...  Would have been nice if they did like... anything to it.   Now, if this review was solely based on the crispy chicken - straight up 5 stars brah.  But factor in the wait time, the lack of seating, the cabbage, the 16 dollar price tag for chicken thighs (granted, the portions were quite generous) and its 3/5."}
