{"text":"First time here, excellent portions for the price and great taste. Will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good gyros at this spot.  Good enough to save a trip to South Side's Mike & Tony's.

Grab them \"to go\", dine-in service is...ehh."}
{"text":"Always preferred Tom's for gyros (for years) until I finally tried this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"This small, family owned restaurant in the South Hills of Pittsburgh is home to some of the best Greek and Mediterranean food around.  This part of Rt. 51 is littered with chain restaurant after chain restaurant, which makes this place seem like a breath of fresh air.  Although the atmosphere is definitely lacking, Gali's delicious food more than makes up for it.

The homemade hummus and tzatziki are both great and are served with a warm, soft pita bread.  It's my favorite tzatziki around...creamy, fresh, and just the right amount of spices.  Another appetizer that I really enjoy is the grape leaves.  They have a great texture and the rice filling is flavorful and vegetarian.

The gyros here are also excellent and can be ordered with lamb, beef, chicken, pork, or vegetables.  Plenty of meat and toppings, with just the right amount of tzatziki sauce.  I sometimes go for the Chicken Plate, which is sort of like a deconstructed gyro...it comes with grilled chicken, sliced tomato and cucumber, feta cheese, greek olives, pita, and a side of tzatziki, all arranged on a plate. Sometimes the chicken is a bit greasy, but it is nonetheless delicious.  

If you find yourself in the South Hills area, this place is a must-try.  Plenty of options for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a few times while in town, and finally went in for a spur-of-the-moment bite last night.  I have pretty high standards for my middle eastern cuisine, having worked in a lebanese restaurant for six years, so i am not the easiest to please when it comes to this genre of food... but i was pleasantly surprised.  

The hummis was pretty tasty-- obviously fresh and homemade, with a subtle tahini flavor and not overpowered by garlic (as it often is).  I also got fresh veggies to dip and they were crisp and delicious.  The grape leaves are awesome because they come vegetarian, and you can get 6 of them for only $3.50 (amazing!).  The only so-so item i got was the spinach pie, and i only thought this because it's too bready for me... it has layers and layers and layers of filo dough and not enough taste to the feta and spinach filling.  Oh and strangely, they do not have tabouli or falafel on the menu.

Overall, though, I will absolutely go here again.  It's so nice to have a good ethnic restaurant in this area that tends to be swallowed up by applebee's galore.  And, a bonus, if you or someone you go with are into super-American cuisine, they even cater to this crowd, offering pizzas, wings, and a variety of more common appetizers."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered for pick up but every time it's been consistently great and the counter staff are very friendly. The gyros are always tasty and the grape leaves have a great lemony tang to them. When it's the right day, we always pick up a pint of wedding soup."}
{"text":"This is a great place for gyros,  the cucumber sauce is excellent,  also all their food is very good.   A great place to eat in or take out. I recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"We traveled from NY and really know our food. We did not expect a lot but got a lot of nothing. They don't cook anything there! The cauliflower app was frozen, no flavor at all. French fries frozen, marinara sauce from jar as well as tsatsiki sauce. Baklava they don't make there, dolma they don't make there, I was dumb founded! Terrible!"}
{"text":"So, I almost always order chicken gyros because 1) I like to pretend they are healthier, and 2) My dog Molly sort of looks like a lamb...but I ventured away from this rule last Monday when after the MS 150 bike ride I was starving for some red meat and ordered the $9.95 gyro special.

Needles to say, it was awesome. The meat was juicy, but somewhat crispy from roasting on whatever you call that rotating gyro stick, the cucumber sauce was creamy but not overdone, and the greek salad dressing was some of the best I've ever had. Spend the extra $1.00 and add feta to that salad for a special treat (it's super fresh and an nice change from the fat free Sam's Club feta I'm use to!).

We also ordered 6 grape leaves, which were served hot and added on the homemade hummus with warm pita bread. By the time it was all said and done, the wife and I walked out for less that $30 and each had a  gyro, salad, iced teas, hummus & grape leaves. We were stuffed and I'm definitely looking forward to the next trip!

One final thought, if you hit it up early enough in the day, head next door to Pastries A La Cart & take home one of the best cakes you'll ever eat too!"}
{"text":"Always meant to try this place but its location is a bit of pain. Today however i had a hankering. I grabbed an extra large gyro to go, and man was it extra large, in fact it was just too unwieldy to eat without utensils. It was however delicious.

Its only my first visit but I can easily see this place being my go to for gyros. I cant wait to explore the rest of the menu, I noticed it was missing tiropita but most of my other favorites are there.

I have to update my review. I originally believed and reported my gyro lacked tomato. I was wrong, there is just SO much meat in the sandwich i didnt notice them lol. Still good reheated the next day too!"}
{"text":"Best Greek in town. We've always loved their gyros but now I'm hooked on the lamb shish kabob. Friendly people and good service to boot. No question that we'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"They do nice gyros. Order them to go quite often, and the staff are always really nice. Had the spinach pastry and couple times and it was good. It's not gourmet, but they might have to step it up with all the high expectations from these reviews."}
{"text":"Never once have we been disappointed. The service is always great and the GYRO? Best in Pittsburgh - hands down!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Traveling to Pittsburg stopped for dinner. The daily special of gyro with choice is side salad, soup or fries and a drink was a lot. The small chicken salad had lots of chicken."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in. The food is fantastic! Great Greek food made with fresh ingredients. The atmosphere is comfortable, the staff quick and very friendly. I can't find a better  $10 lunch anywhere...huge gyro, basket of fries or soup or salad, and drink. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"One word - DELICIOUS!

This restaurant is nothing fancy, but it is relaxed with a \"mom & pop\" feel, and the service was great. I ordered a gyro and the fried meatballs - amazing!"}
{"text":"Best gyros around pittsburgh hands down better than mike & Tony in south side but the waiters are a little moodie"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great gyro subs. Left there full! First time trying grape leaves and thought they were pretty good! Definitely coming back! Friendly service btw..oh and they have the BEST ice!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After being completely clueless about where to go for lunch, my mother and I wound up at Gali's. I was impressed from the moment I walked in, as this was the first time I had ever been in a sit-down Greek restaurant. Their gyro special includes French fries, soup, or salad along with your gyro and drink for 10$. I had the special, with wedding soup, and my mom had a salad. The soup was great, as was the gyro. The place got busy just after we got in, too, which shows how much business the place gets and deserves. The food, service, and atmosphere were all wonderful, and I would happily recommend this place to anyone and I hope to be back soon myself."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in the area hands down! Delicious wedding soup, grape leaves, and fresh salads as well."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek spot.  Gyros are the norm around the burgh and this one will challenge your taste buds to fight over the few other establishments that have a taste gyro.  Usually stop during lunch hours and it's not to busy to sit inside. Can't beat the lunch deal for how filling the food is. Great service and comfortable atmosphere. Will for sure return when in the area."}
{"text":"The BEST gyros! Also among the tastiest Mediterranean food I've enjoyed in the Pittsburgh area. I've never been disappointed by the food or the service here and would happily travel out of my way to eat here when a gyro craving strikes. Yummy! Bonus is that it's right next to one of my favorite bakeries."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have lunch!!! The gyros and greek platter are amazing!! Best gyro meat and tzatiki i have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years anytime I get a craving for a gyro. This place puts Mike and Tony's to shame. They are a generous size and come with delicious seasoned meat, fresh toppings, and the best tzatziki sauce I've had anywhere, hands down. If you love gyros, come here and order the daily gyro special. A large gyro with a side (soup, salad, or fries), and a drink for a little over $11. It can't be beat! Other than the gyro, I've also had their baba ganoush, hummus, and baklava. Although all were delicious, my only complaint was that the dips don't really come with a lot of pita, and it's an extra charge for more. The baklava was terrific and a pretty decent size though. Just the right amount of everything! Aside from the food, I've never had an issue with customer service either. Overall, if you love Greek/Mediterranean food, come to Gali's and for sure try a gyro!"}
{"text":"Love this place, gyros are very good, not small either.  You won't leave this place hungry. Best gyros in Pittsburgh. Soups are great, too. Place is nice and quiet, very very very clean. Staff always pleasant."}
{"text":"We go to this Mediterranean  restaurant often because it is on our side of town. I would like if they would put more gyro sauce on my gyro. And there prices are a little steep compared to other Mediterranean restaurants."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pleasant Hills 30 years and never been to Gali's. today we did, It was fantastic. Both had gyro's , tons of fresh meat, fresh made pita, a great sauce.also had chicken rice soup ,los of chicken,lots of carrots, it was great.A really nice clean restaurant. Go there. You'll love it. We are anxious to return!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's larger then I thought it would be. There are a decent amount of tables and the decor is pretty basic with a few pieces of Greek inspired artwork. The girl who was our waitress was very prompt and made us feel welcomed. 

Now onto to food. They have a daily special that is 9.99 for a gyro drink and soup, salad or fries. I went with the salad and house Greek dressing. The dressing was good and I even took a bottle home. The gyro itself was great. For me there are 3 main things I look for in a good gyro. The tzatziki must hold up to the meat and veggies. It needs to be creamy. 2nd the lettuce onion and tomato must be fresh and last but not least the meet needs to be tender and juicy. This place delivered on all front. For dessert I split the baklava. I wish I could have it for breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm looking forward to my next gyro that's for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The gyro was perfect, with awesome meat!  Erin was a fantastic server.  This was our first visit here and will not be our last!"}
{"text":"I travel often an look for places off he beaten path to eat. If you like Greek food, this place is a gem! Do yourself a favor and get the Greek platter!"}
{"text":"Best gyros we've had in a very long time!  My husband ordered the X-Large gyro and had two meals out of it!  Overflowing with meat.  We did take-out, but the next time, we'll probably eat in the restaurant.  For those of you familiar with Rt. 51 in Pleasant Hills, it's located in the same little plaza as Pastries A La Carte.  Try it.  I think you;ll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and looking for great gyros, this is your place.
Everything about this place was excellent.
1. Location - Easy to find, easy parking
2. Interior - Clean tables, floors, restrooms, and simple décor.
3. Staff - Very friendly and professional
Food
1. Plenty of food for a great price
2. Very good quality and delicious
3. Delivered to your table fast

Some small details that impressed me:
1. Our server brought a cold squeeze bottle of ketchup from the fridge. Not a room temp bottle left on the table, or packets guarded like they are gold.
2. My fries were perfect, straight out of the fryer, no skins, no salt(but in shakers on the table).
3. Crushed ice in the drinks, not cubes.
4. Server was very knowledgeable of the menu and provided excellent advice."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... I can't believe this gem exist in the decaying outskirts of the century III/pleasant hills area. It is amazing! If you leave here hungry, there's something wrong with you. Perfect, larger than life gyros at unbelievable prices. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great find on a business trip with hotel recommendation for \"not a chain\". Posted pix of amazing vegetarian platter put together upon request."}
{"text":"I'm goin' back to Gali's, Gali's, Gali's
I'm goin' back to Gali's, man, for a Gyro
I'm goin' back to Gali's, Gali's, Gali's
I'm goin' back to Gali's.

What to get: a Gyro, duhh
What else: this review is for the amazing Lisa, who sent me here (at gunpoint)
What else else: she should raise it to a 5 like she raised me to an 8

I know a lot about Gyros. Pittsburgh makes Chicago-style Gyros (arguably the best kind), shaved off the spinning rotating cylinder of ground beef-and-lamb. A lot of places use fake frozen strips of meat. Not in The Burgh and definitely not here.

Gali's is simply the best Gyro in the Burgh. There's plenty of competition, too, from the likes of Mike & Tony's, but this one is my favourite. It's consistent, it's delicious, and it always hits the spot, so to speak, in an eating sense, not in any other sense.

The Central Diner also has a very good one, but expensive, and the Istanbul Grille Gyro (and everything) is awesome, but Gali's edges it out, pricewise as well. Also, they have excellent service, both from the waitresses and the owner. Excellent.

It's out of the way in the southtowns, but it's well worth stopping by.

And if you don't believe me, let's allow LL Cool J to finish the review off:

I'm going back to Gali's, the Gyro's surprising
Advising friends to go here, they're sizing it up
If you wear bikinis - get a small; a large if you're tall
She said... she liked... the onions.

She showed me the Burgh, gave me a pita
and pulled out the tzaziki sauce
Now I thought that was fast, but this Gyro was ready faster
I'm lookin' for a real good meal
I said, \"Close your eyes, I got a surprise,\"
and I ran away with both of the Gyros

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali.. I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali.. I don't think so"}
{"text":"Great place for a gyro!   We came by on a Friday night before a movie.  The place was pretty busy, with plenty of tables and a lot of take out orders.  We did simple gyros, which were stuffed full and very tasty (if a little messy).  Service was good and quick - took no time at all to get our food.   Will definitely return to try some other things."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a delicious lunch here today 3/23/15! I had the grape leaves for an Appetizer and had a gyro for my entree! It was absolutely to die for! The grape leaves were so amazing! I had them at other greek restaurants before, but these were by far the best ones i have ever had in my LIFE!! So sweet & tangy! They came out nice and warm! They were delightful! The gyro i had was a monster! There was so much Lamb in it! I couldn't even get it in my mouth! It was so good! The lamb was so tender! The pita shell was so soft and tasteful! It was just an all around great experience! The service was a 5 out of 10, but the poor lady was all by herself and the place was so busy! You can't fault her for that! I couldnt get mad. I felt so bad for her! She did a stand up job! I wanted to help her! She was great! I CAN NOT wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd never find another Greek place as my one in NY. Well I was pleasantly surprised. They food was AMAZING! I am so happy to find this place. I love absolutely everything we tried."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant find while visiting family in Pittsburgh. The gyros are enormous and stuffed full of fresh and wonderful ingredients. The staff was super friendly, helpful, and over the top with pride for their workplace. The cleanliness of the place speaks volumes of the pride the owners, management, and workers must have over their work area.

*My only comment, would be they should add wine and beer to the menu."}
{"text":"Really good gyros I would stop and get then once every two weeks coming home from work great food and people"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today - three of us all together - our first visit.  We tend to order to share while honoring each others specific tastes.   What a wonderful experience!  I believe it exceeded our expectations and we fully intend to return.

After careful consideration (by me-it could possibly be my last meal- so be very diligent!), we started with the Special Greek Platter.  It included grape leaves, which we all enjoyed, fried meatballs (only two of us ate these - they are awesome), Spanakopita (delicious),feta, olives, tomatoes, and hummus (maybe the best I have tasted!) This is a great choice for 2-4 people to have a sample of many wonderful tastes or for one to have a very nice personal feast.

We shared two large salads, the Bifteki - greek salad (essentially) with 2 greek burgers and the Half & Half - again greek salad with gyro meat and chicken.  Our server was happy to provide an additional dish and offered more if we required them - nice touch!  Both salads were served with their greek dressing and cucumber sauce. I am a sauce and dressing person and tend to order \"extra\" - what was provided was quite sufficient for our party.  I really liked all of the meats as well as the salad itself.  For me the thinly sliced gyro meat was the star, then the chicken and lastly the greek burger.  The others in the group would have rated it differently, one with burger at the top, then chicken(she thought it a bit over cooked), then gyro meat (but she doesn't care for it at all and still said it was good) and the other gyro, burger, chicken.  Nobody was unhappy!!

The restaurant  was quite clean and comfortable for a very casual eatery.  The service was very considerate and attentive without being overbearing. The entire staff was very friendly and welcoming.

All-in-all an extremely pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"Service is poor. 
I mean hell, it takes 5 mins to get a order in. No refills bc the waitress never comes back. No extra napkins. This is at lunch with 3 waitresses. 
Prices are high
Cucumber sauce has too much dill.
Also the wedding soup had one meatball."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. My wife called in a take out order on Saturday. We ordered a Gyro platter and a gyro hoagie. My wife ordered the platter with extra olives and no cucumbers. After getting the food home and opening it she realized they gave her some type of salad. Salads are half the price of the platter. The receipt stated platter plus .80 for extra olives. It had 10 half pieces of french fries, 7 olives(paid .80 cents for extra olives), cucumbers (asked for without), green peppers(not on the platter), salad dressing(not on platter), stale pita wrapped in foil, and the 2 pieces of tomato were just the butt end of a tomato. She called and a so called supervisor got on the phone. The employee was totally ignorant on the phone. She told my wife that she doesn't know how to read a menu and the food we got was a platter. My wife has been in the food business for 30 years with a culinary degree. The employee did not even try to give an apology and hung up on my wife. Customer service could not be worse."}
{"text":"Their food is really great. I love this place. It's a bit expensive if your looking to feed your family. I prefer to come here alone or with just my husband."}
{"text":"This is our absolutely favorite place to eat gyros. The family who owns this restaurant is incredibly nice. The owners are always here and serving up their amazing food. Their wedding soup is the best I've ever had. The food is served hot and fresh. They also sell their homemade Greek salad dressing and olive oil. You'll want to take both home."}
{"text":"Excellent! If you are looking for a great mom and pop Greek restaurant,  this is it! Not easy access from Clairton rd, but definitely worth turning around for,

Tried the special Greek platter, everything was delicious.  I especially liked the grape leaves. Best I have had in a while. And the spinach pie was awesome!. Somehow.managed to find room for a gyro too.

A great deal for.the money, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the grape leaves for my appetizer.  AWESOME!  The large gyro was almost too much. Can't imagine what the extra large looks like. 2nd time here. Will not be the last."}
{"text":"We pasted by this place on our way through pleasant hills. When deciding between Subway and chick-fil-a, I decided I wanted something that was more local than a national chain. We decided to eat here because of the ratings plus i never turn down a good gyro.

The interior is pretty small til i seen extra seating in the back which i assume had booths but there was a wall blocking the view of the tables. we were seated but in chairs that kinda remind you your at the mall with the thin padding and jail bar backing. The menu was pretty nice with lots of choices of authentic greek dishes. I ordered grape leaves and my sis got the bubaganush which is eggplant hummus with pita bread. The grape leaves were tangy and the rice nice and soft, i really enjoyed the flavor. As for the hummus, it was GREAT!! the flavor of olive juice in the hummus made it so delicious with the soft pita bread. It wasn't too salty or bland but just right for my taste buds.

For our meal we ordered a 2 large gyros while my niece got chicken fingers and fries. Nothing special about the chicken fingers although the were cooked to order. The Gyro was HUGE!! Lots of meat i mean LOTS like 10 slices i think. When you add all the lettuce, tomatoes, onion and sauce, the pita could barely hold all the ingredients in. :D This made for a great looking gyro. The flavor was nothing too amazing but it was pretty good. It tasted like other gyros I've had but it just had more meat on it. The gyro only cost $6.19 which isn't bad for how amazingly huge it was. 

As far as being satisfied it goes way beyond that. I couldn't even finish my gyro even tho the grape leaves and hummus may be to blame for that. Regardless it was a pretty good meal and I enjoyed everything that i ate. The service was decent. The waitress informed us of how everything was house made (excluding chicken) and we even got to thank the owners who were authentic greeks. They accept credit cards which is nice too because from first glance they appear to be cash only. I would definitely recommend this place over the gyro spots in pittsburgh, the fact that they have an X-tra large gyro over the Large gyros that we ate blows my mind! You should definitely check them out!!"}
{"text":"Simple review - Best gyros in the south hills.  Hands down a go to for me. Been coming here since they opened and I will be coming here until I can no longer physically come anymore. Food is alway amazing, service is friendly and fast. The sitting room is a little small but I love coming in here to eat. You always run into someone you know. If you haven't tried them yet.  Please give them a try you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"The moment you enter this fine establishment you are greeted by the waitresses or owners and seated promptly. It is a quaint location right off of 51. This is one of my favorite places to go in all of Pittsburgh! I've tried hundreds of gyros from all over the world, and this by far is the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this delicious traditional Greek cuisine. They have a gyro special, for $11.29 you get a large gyro, salad or fries and soda/tea. It is a deal you can't beat. 

It is great for a quick lunch or enjoyable dinner, they can accommodate your every need. You absolutely will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food.  The Gyro's are huge and have great authentic flavoring. The fried meatballs and the three cheese pita are also delicious.  Very good prices and friendly service.  You won't regret eating here for a great Greek experience."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a while, lately the prices have been going up and seems like the food isn't that good anymore , we ordered three gyros and all seemed to be over cooked."}
{"text":"My wife hates gyros.  She ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY hates gyros.  But she loves these (and as a matter of fact is craving them something fierce as I type this).  I could probably end my review here, but let me elaborate further.

Darren W. is absolutely right -- eating one of these gyros is a truly Herculean effort.  I can just barely finish one, and I'm guaranteed to not be hungry for more or less the rest of the day.  And what a gyro it is!  Gigantic, toasty pita.  Wonderfully seasoned lamb, and tons of it.  Tzatziki sauce that is one part cool cucumber and two parts AMBROSIA OF THE GODS.  Crisp lettuce, juicy tomato, flavorful onion.  All wrapped up in a large foil package that contains all the wonders of modern compression technology therein, because the package itself is deceptively SMALL for what lies within.

Darren also jokingly claims that if you give the Minotaur this gyro, he'll be your friend.  I'm in absolute agreement, except for one detail.  The story usually ends with the Minotaur having the gyro for lunch, right?  At Gali's, the gyro is so huge and powerful that THE GYRO HAS THE MINOTAUR FOR LUNCH, not the other way around.

Highly, highly, recommended.

EAT GYRO OR DIE!"}
{"text":"Mount Olympus lies in the Pittsburgh suburb of  Pleasant Hills. No foolin'.

Hercules would walk out  of Gali's with a full belly. 

Gali's also sells pizza, hoagies, spaghetti, and the like for the unadventurous, but why order Italian or American when Gali's offers one Titan of a gyro?

I ordered four of these Gegenees thinking that two wouldn't be enough to feed my tribe. I barely surpassed one. The meat is so plentiful, the soft, fresh pita bread could barely contain it all. The tzatziki sauce was sweeter than Aphrodite, and the onions, tomatoes, and lettuce tasted as if they were harvested by Demeter herself. These were Thessaloniki gyros, meaning they were mammoths. 

Mom's birthday is due soon, so I ordered for her a Special Greek Platter which includes grape leaves, the best spanakopita I have ever tasted (she let me sample a corner of this phlaky phyllo phantasy pie), fried meatballs (lamb? pork? who cares? tasty!), feta cheese, tomato slices, olives, pita bread, that tzatziki cream, and a supremely smooth, nutty hummus. 

She's now readjusting her will. 

The Appetizer Platter has the meatballs, tzatziki sauce, and fried zucchini (cut properly into long strips), onion rings, more shaved lamb, and calamari so divine, it could have come from Pontos.

Gali's is proof that Pittsburgh's southern suburbs are not Tartarus."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in the Pittsburgh area. The Tzatziki sauce they put on the Gyro is authentic and absolutely the best I have had in Pittsburgh. The homemade Greek Salad dressing is awesome. Try the lunch special with Gyro, salad and a drink. You won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"5 stars all day for their gyros!!  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but will one day.  Their walls are plastered with Trib awards for best ethnic food and such, so other menu items must be good.  I usually stop for lunch take out or eat in.  Service is always cool and dining area clean.  I'd recommend here for any gyro lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Best meal every time! I have my whole family enjoying it now. Very clean dining room! Take out or dine in are both enjoyable.."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this place.  Definitely a big surprise considering it's on a relatively major road.  

The atmosphere definitely is not here, but the food makes up for it. At first glance, $8.99 for a gyro, fries, and drinks seems at the higher end (compared to the \"other\" gyro joints in town) but once you receive your order, you understand why.

I would go so far as to say they have the best gyro in the city.  The pita was perfect - large, soft, and well seasoned.  It was packed with well-seasoned lamb, and topped with just the right amount of tatziki.  As a gyro connoisseur, I would put this at the top of the pack in the area.  I'm wishing it wasn't 4 hours away (sarcasm, but South Hills  traffic, ugh) so I could try another one.  

If you're on miserable 51, stop in for a gyro, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Delicious wedding soup, and a gyro that was just way too much food, but who's complaining about that? Has the feeling of a down-home, family-run establishment (although I'm not sure if that's true or not, since I'm just passing through town). No music playing in the dining area the Monday night I was there, so I could overhear all my neighbors' conversations. Also, they don't take American Express, so plan ahead. 

Summary: Quality food, friendly service, homey feel!"}
{"text":"Super clean inside, nice comfortable climate, great staff, appropriate pricing, and very tasty food.  The wedding soup is perfect on a cool day.  Big fan of the gyro w/ feta cheese and everything else on it.  The veggies are fresh and the lamb is nice and hot.  This place fills up at lunch, for obvious reasons, so give yourself enough time to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was average. The woman who took my order seemed angry at the world... The portion size and quality of food was really good though!"}
