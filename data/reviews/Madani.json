{"text":"Honestly, their pizza is just flat out amazing. It's always fresh, flavourful, and it is very affordable. It's the neighbourhood pizza spot that will always be a favourite. 
I'm pretty sure the large one topping is $9.99 but don't quote me on it. Regardless the price , it's worth it. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Madani is a local grocery store that specializes in Halal meats, kebabs, fresh bread and take-out pizza. My friend heard about this spot by word of mouth and I am so thankful we gave this place a try. The store is a little crammed and messy on the inside but do not be fooled by the appearance because the food is amazing. For just under $12 (including taxes), you can get a large pizza with 3 toppings and a garlic dipping sauce. The pizza itself was delicious. The ingredients tasted fresh, leaving each bite as flavourful as the last and the crust was nice and crispy. We waited around 15 minutes for our order and it passed by quickly because we got sidetracked by all the neat products on the shelves. Overall, Madani was a pleasant experience and we would recommend it to anyone. They have very friendly staff and mostly importantly... an affordable menu!

Note: They accept MasterCard, American Express,

{"text":"Served us kabooli pulao that had gone bad, and smelt horrible (did not smell or taste like how kabooli pulao should). 

The man at the back made no efforts to compensate for selling me $35 worth of sour/spoiled food. Will not order again, bad customer service and unwilling to cooperate over the fact they sold me $35 worth of spoiled food.

I have ordered from here in the past, and it was good. But this time they served spoiled food."}
{"text":"Great food~Specially koobideh kabab and koobideh roll are my favorite. Very fresh tasty flavourful grilled meat. I like chicken but beef is better. Very affordable price yet generous portion."}
{"text":"Honestly, $9.99 for a three-topping pizza (and a scrumptious sauce included)? This place is legit. Madani is situated in a building that has seen many businesses come to die (A Portugese chicken joint and Elena's Ukrainian deli were the last triumphant warriors that ventured into this spot located in the midst of Richmond Hill's crowded Yonge & King intersection and left defeated. Madani, however, has (so far!) survived the test of time, and with good reason. Walk into this store and you may be baffled at just how much inventory the owners fit into such a tight space. Halal butchery to your left (at the back), pizza and kebab ordering area to your right, and tons of ethnic produce all in between! This is also a go-to for my family when we are craving koobideh or sheesh kebab (yumz!! The rice is so pillowy, the meat is perfect, the salad is drenched in a delicious but light ranch-like sauce and you get a little tomato too - all for about $7.99). I love that they have halal \"pepperoni\" (beef) for the pizza (there is halal salami sold at the counter to the right of the pizza part). The employees' primary language is not English so do be a little patient, but they are very friendly and helpful :) I am a loyal follower of the Madani way."}
{"text":"I come here for their pizzas. I always get great deals. It's tasty homemade-like pizza, I would recommend it to anyone who would like a great tasting and fast dinner ;)

The only con is how long it takes to make, I usually order for pick up and they say it'll be ready in 20 mins but on countless occasions it took longer. Like really it shouldn't take longer than 20 mins."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short and sweet so here it goes.
Whenever I'm in the area craving some nice Mid East food I drop by. The place is very clean. I haven't bought any meats from here but I have gotten take out on multiple occasions. Their food overall is good.
Decent place, decent food, decent prices, great customer service."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best kebabs in GTA. I have tried kebabs at the Iranian and Persian restaurants at North York and at chains such as Bamiyan and Paramount. These places do not stand a chance against Madani. Perfect seasoning, texture and flavors, and definitely worth the money - very generous portions. 
Give this place a try. This place is a grocery store with an awesome meat section, and obliviously the kitchen that serves great food... and Pizzas !!!

Kudos to Madani !!!"}
