{"text":"We came here for Tuesday night trivia and had a very mediocre to bad experience.  The service was slow, the beer list was nonexistent and the trivia was terrible.  We could not hear the trivia announcer, he did not explain the rules and he was not friendly when asked about them.  We tried to get a hockey game on the TV and it took asking three servers.  We will stick with our regular trivia at vinyl pi and will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with friends.  Good, tasty food. Fast service, with great staff. Theme nights are fun.  Never pricey."}
{"text":"Returned to Al's for the first time in a long time. Now in their new location in the same Magnolia center. Excellent bar atmosphere, great outside seating, great wings as always!, excellent service. We will put this place back on our list of favorite places at the lake."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed tonight. Got wrong beer order initially. We both ordered burgers, we're not asked how we wanted them, and they came well done. Waitress didn't check on us during meal and brought check without asking if we wanted another beer or dessert. We ordered beer anyway.
Entire meal and service a disappointment."}
