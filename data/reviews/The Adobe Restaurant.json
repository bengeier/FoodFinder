{"text":"My husband and I met at this restaurant in April 2005 on the patio during a political fundraiser. We chose to get married on the day of our 6th anniversary and wanted to incorporate the location where we met, if at all possible. We decided to host our rehearsal dinner at the Adobe Restaurant. There has been some fluctuation and instability at the restaurant in recent years as ownership and staff has changed. We worked with Jim Gallen to get everything arranged. Jim worked with us to meet our budget while providing an incredible evening for our guests. The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Our event was hosted privately on the patio and nothing could have been better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good especially for being at a golf course. The breakfast is awesome and my family loves it because you can sit on the patio and look at the golf course. The drinks are tasty too and service was very professional. Prices were fair beings it is in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Our gracious host took us out-of-towners to breakfast at the country club.

The food and service was good. They offered typical breakfast fare at slightly elevated prices, but then again, we're on a golf course with a parking lot full of Jaguars, BMWs and a Lotus Elise (I think) and properties that are on the market for a whopping starting price of $12M!

The outdoor seating was perfect for a warm Phoenix morning."}
{"text":"I have to say that I LOVE the Biltmore and I would go back to this restaurant. I just would not order what I did, the corn beef hash. It's not homemade. I had been there in the past and it was homemade. Apparently they had a chef/menu change. The thing that bothered me was this: on their menu it's listed as a 'signature dish'. I was pretty disappointed that a 'signature dish' at the Biltmore came from a can."}
{"text":"It's a great, casual restaurant again.  Good food, flexible kitchen--lovely staff.  It's even better than the old days."}
{"text":"I obviously had low expectations going in. It is just a golf course burger shack, after all. The chicken sandwich with tomato, cheddar, avocado and bacon wasn't too bad at all. The fries are cut so thin that you must eat them immediately: extremely thin fries like this get cold very quickly and are thus inedible.

The service, surprisingly enough, was the low point. Our server literally showed us the bare minimum of courtesy, not even greeting us upon arrival. \"Have you made your decision?\" was the introduction. A very simple \"Hello how are you?\" would suffice.

It is obvious that this job is just a temporary one for the wait staff, and it shows.

You get what you expect: simple menu, simple food, simple service...nothing to keep you away, nothing to entice you to come back. Basically this destination is the place to be when you're done practicing your swing."}
{"text":"Not bad for a small restaurant on a golf course. My sandwich was done perfectly (Adobe melt), but I wasn't a big fan of the tiny fries. Service was below par though as one server was visibly annoyed by doing her job."}
{"text":"We recently were there for breakfast and left thoroughly impressed.  First of all, the atmosphere is great.  We sat outside with a view of the golf course framed by the distant mountains.  The outdoor patio is dog friendly and we saw a variety of breeds, one cuter and friendlier than the next.  The food was excellent.  I had the yogurt with homemade granola that the staff was quick to brag about ( and for good reason).  We usually don't eat egg white omelettes but my wife ordered one and it was as good as any I ever had.   Our friend had the blueberry pancakes, which were also very good.  The staff was extremely friendly and helped each other out.  They seem very proud to work there and appear to really enjoy each other and  their customers. Finally, all of this for what I thought was a very reasonable price.  Even though they are next to the Biltmore, these were not resort restaurant prices."}
{"text":"Not a very inspired menu.  Hotel food and service that is average at best.  Nice golf course and good view from the patio.  I would suggest drinks and apps."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until today when a client asked to be taken here for lunch. He was an older guy, but I figured it would be good because I suggested Chelsea's Kitchen and he stayed on track wanting to go to this place.

Shortly after my whining tantrum caused purely by jealousy after driving through the Biltmore Estates we arrived at the restaurant. It is connected to the Golf Course but certainly isn't a \"Biltmore\" experience.

Obviously inexperienced wait staff (who did just fine, but a little awkward) and very limited menu. Just one side of one page with very normal stuff like burgers and turkey sandwiches.

I got a grilled chicken sandwich, by other two coworkers got sammies also. One a BBQ chicken and the other a burger. Our client got a turkey sandwich. ho hum..

Nothing to rave about. Several other older folks at tables. I'd say it was just fine for the price point but certainly not a place to go to unless you are hungry before or after a round and want a bite to eat. Considering the options in the area, I won't be back."}
{"text":"\"Slightly elevated prices.\" Great location, very quiet and peaceful area on course. Good was fine. Avocado toast was delicious (medium portions). I would suggest early morning breakfast (7am) as we head into summer. $5 mimosas not bad! Service was great... the golf course has a pace which translates to their service. Felt welcomed in a sea of older folks - very much appreciated. Would likely return."}
{"text":"Menu selection disappointing. Cob salad was good though. Being named the Adobe restaurant i expected a couple tex-mex selections.  Nope, typical golf club restaurant.  Expected more from the Biltmore.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Great fries but that was about it. 

It's a club house restaurant that serves sandwiches and burgers and caters to the people there to golf on the course. The food wasn't spectacular. I had the turkey reuben and tried some of my friend's Adobe melt and it left me with me with a \"meh\" experience. I just figured for the price, $11 for a sandwich, that I should have a \"yummy\" experience. 

I do like our server. She was nice enough to split the check for the large party we had and was honest about the guacamole. Apparently, its not so good there. 

So if you ever end up lost on the greens at the Biltmore and end up at Adobe, just get the fries. That's about all I wanted to eat."}
{"text":"While on a business trip, I stopped here for lunch and overall I was very satisfied. Comfortable, good service, and good food made for a relaxing Sunday afternoon lunch.

I seated myself in the indoor part of the casual restaurant in front of a TV playing the golf tournament. It took several minutes before a server came to give me a menu, but I wasn't in a hurry so that was tolerable. I got an iced water to cool off after being outside in the hot Phoenix sun, and the servers and busboys kept it full throughout the meal which was much appreciated.

I started with the \"frickles\", a basket of deep fried dill pickle spears that were fantastic. The pickles inside were very flavorful and tasty, while the fried batter was super crispy and delicious. Probably the highlight of my meal, they were excellent.

The place has tons of burgers, salads, and sandwiches that sounded good, but what caught my eye was the Sonoran-style hot dog: an all beef Vienna sausage with a sesame seed bun, topped with bacon, guacamole, chopped tomatoes and jalape√±os, and a spicy aioli. I was hoping it would be a little spicier, but a little Cholula helped kick it up a notch. Decent, but I think it could've been a little more flavorful.

Overall, the experience was casual, comfortable, and satisfying. Definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"We had lunch after golf . Our waiter had a difficult  time , he brought  out an ice tea when we ordered  water. We asked for appetizers  and it came with  the meal. The chips did not taste fresh . The salsa was too thick. We were overcharged. It took 10 minutes  to get our bill and 10 minutes  to get a take out. Box. It was a challenge"}
{"text":"As golf course clubhouse faire goes, you could certainly do worse than Adobe.  The dishes here won't blow you away and the prices are a bit inflated for what you get, but when the weather is nice this is a charming little gathering spot for groups both big and small.  A great view of the Biltmore golf course and a casual relaxed atmosphere have been drawing my parents here for weekend brunches for years.  Another part of the draw for many is the fact that many don't even know this place exists, or that its accessible to the general public.  Ergo, its almost never crowded.  As was the case today.

For those who've never heard of this place, a quick tutorial.  Enter the Biltmore at 24th Street and Missouri.  Take the main road (stay on the right side of the road the whole way) all the way till the road ends at the Biltmore Golf Course parking lot.  Walk towards the clubhouse and you'll find a large outdoor patio area.  Head to the doors that open to patio and that's where the hostess is located.  There's attendants in the parking lot in case you get lost and you don't have to be golfing that day to dine there.

Today I came with my Dad as this is always his weekend brunch standby.  There's seating for probably about 100 altogether, so we've never had to wait for a table.  Today the patio was pretty packed with golfers so we dined inside.  Their brunch menu is pretty much all traditional American faire.  Burgers, sandwiches, omelets, the usual suspects.  One dish that my folks and I have here that stands out is their California Eggs Benedict.  Turkey, poached eggs, avocado, arugula, and hollandaise on an english muffin.  It's not cheap at $15, though the portion is big enough that you don't really need a side.  Today it was just as good as I remembered and I left pretty satisfied.

I will echo some (though not all) of the comments regarding the service here.  The staff here has always been super friendly to us, though I will agree it can be a little slower than it should be.  Today was actually pretty adequate, though we have oftentimes had long waits for our meals and/or long waits for the bill.  The other thing that I will say is unfortunate about this place is the patio is basically unusable during the summer months.  If they would put misters and/or a larger shade structure outside over the patio area you might be compelled to chance an outdoor dining experience during the summer.  But so far, no dice.

So if you're playing a round at the Biltmore or just in the neighborhood, the Adobe is a fairly decent spot for traditional American faire in a relaxed environment.  No lines, no pretentiousness, no riffraff.  The ambiance is quite pristine given the big city hustle and bustle that surrounds the area.  Its not a goto for me the way it is for my folks, but hey, to each their own."}
{"text":"We had a great afternoon at the Adobe!  The frickles were awesome!  The service is top notch and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I should start off by saying that the breakfast that I had at the Adobe on several different occasions was far better then the lunch I had the other day. I don't want to give a negative review about the entire restaurant because I had one bad salad. I love Caesar salads and this time, it was the worst salad dressing I have ever tasted. It taste like pure mayonnaise on my salad. I could barely eat what I did and the grilled chicken was not very tasty and the texture was rubbery.  I'm not one who likes to complain about service or food to an establishment, nor do I want a free meal. However, as the server was taking my barely eaten salad away, one would think the obvious question and the server might've asked the customer was how was everything? When I mentioned my displeasure with the salad dressing, I was ignored. This will not deter me from coming back because the Adobe is a special place to sit outside and enjoy the view. It's also very dog friendly and right in my backyard. So to sum things up, I give their breakfast a three-star and their Caesar salad should only get one star."}
{"text":"El Hefe is the best server ever - we asked for a pitcher of mimosas and he delivered!"}
{"text":"It's a club house at a Golf Course, exactly what you'd expect.  Traditional fare, mediocre execution, inflated prices, but with a great view of the course."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money on this place.  We waited 20 minutes to get water to the table. Finally, two different busboys delivered sets of water glasses to the same talbe!  The bread/rolls never came at all.  Finally a waiter showed up, and without apology or explanation, asked us for our full orders (drinks and food). The food, when it eventually arrived was okay, but we needed to ask a couple of times for missing things.  We asked our waiter for example why the baked potatoes didn't have any butter with them.  He replied that the chef \"always\" melts butter on the potatoes.  We told him we were pretty darn sure there was no butter on these potatoes and it took him another 10 minutes to find us some butter pats. This is definitely one place worth skipping, even with the lovely patio and firepits."}
{"text":"This place gets a little better every time I go there. 

Normally, golf course restaurants serve overpriced wanna-be fancy food so they can sleep at night for charging you fourteen dollars for a glorified hot dog. Not here. You order a hot dog, and you get a hot dog, and a pretty good one, if I do say so myself. 

They have some healthier offerings but none of it is pretentious or gives you the typical golf course food feeling. I have gone here for lunch a few times and it feels almost more like a sports bar where people just dress a little funny. Which, relatively speaking, is a good thing."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Terrible service, no bread until requested three times, bland unseasoned food and 16 bucks for a salad. Pass on this place. Only the valet was worthwhile."}
{"text":"My family and I used to live nearby and we used to walk here almost every Saturday for breakfast. It's been about four years, and so it was great to come back and see how the place has changed. The interior is updated, the windows are fresh and new and there is a incredibly comfortable couch and chairs in front of a massive fireplace. 

We walked over here for breakfast this morning from the Biltmore and of course we had to have the big AZ burrito, this cannot be beat and when you are in Arizona, This is what you need to have for breakfast!

My husband and I split it because it was big, A bowl of fruit along with coffee.. total breakfast cost was $26 before tip. 

The views here simply cannot be beat, you are sitting directly on the golf course, with views of Camelback

Service was prompt and efficient from Melanie.  

Worth the trip folks!"}
{"text":"The Adobe on the Biltmore Golf Course has a great burger and cool relaxed bar and patio. When others places are charging for sides and fries, the Adobe burger was $12 and included a huge burger with tons of sweet potato fries. Check it out, definitely worth a lunch or breakfast visit."}
{"text":"Last time we were here, this was place was pretty basic. It seems as though they have stepped it up a bit! The food was great and our server was cute as a button.

We came to hit balls and hang out since the weather finally got sunny and nice again! We had a few drinks and were able to partake in the $5 boodys and mimosas which they offer on Sundays. Not sure if they offer it any other time but I was happy I was there.

I had the cobb which was HUGE but delicious. Hubs had the turkey burger, friend 1 had the burger, friend 2 had the eggs benny cali style. Everything was delicious! The fries are yummy shoe string fries and the onion rings are thick and tasty.

From the first time we went, to now, we always talked about going again and hitting balls more often and we don't end up doing it, but I hope this is a reminder for us to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Two words....Don't bother!  Service terrible. Came for a quick breakfast. Not a lot of options. Ordered scrambled eggs, bagel and fruit. Fruit was the best part. Sent back the eggs. Couldn't even take a bite. Bagel tasted like it was from the grocery store. Brought cream cheese and no butter. By the time we got the butter the bagel was cold. Delivered our food and we only had one set of silverware. We wanted to hit the pool and not spend time driving to breakfast. Worst mistake!  If you're looking for great breakfast go to Matt's Big Breakfast and Snooze!  They were amazing. Amazed this place is attached to the Biltmore. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was friendly but very slow. 

I wouldn't recommend it for the money."}
{"text":"We used to go there every Sunday morning because the food was excellent and the staff was so friendly and efficient. You just felt welcomed and special. Then a change in management ... well we go somewhere else now."}
{"text":"This place is convenient for anyone who lives in one of the many communities surrounding the Biltmore Resort or golf course.  Recently remodeled, in the winter it's cozy to gather around their fire place or if the temperatures are moderate, eat on their patio.
     As for the food...that's another story.  This restaurant has possibly THE WORST coffee served in the Western Hemisphere.  It's bitter, acidic and tastes burnt.  And the chef is apparently a primadonna.  Asked to have an omelet served 'scrambled' he (or she) instead chopped up the omelet rather than bother to wisk it in a bowl (as any properly scrambled egg dish should be done). 
     The wait staff is 'hit or miss'....several of them are attentive and care but one or two seem bothered at having to wait on people. 
      So the net: location 8+ Food 4-  service, uneven."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting here which was a great experience... the service was great, food was good, price was ok and the location and view was nice.   This is a great place for lunch to relax and get away from the crazy city scene."}
