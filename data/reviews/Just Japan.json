{"text":"This place is amazing, we ordered the shrimp dynamite roll and the dinner plate number 2 with a mixture of different things and it was delicious. Super fresh and very flavourful, the positions are large as well so you are getting what you pay for here. Staff was very nice and overall it was a good experience I would definitely recommend it and will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Attempted to crush my sushi cravings but should have thought twice!  I decided to come here for lunch and grab some takeout, seeing as I was in the area. When I walked in I asked for a take out menu and to my surprise everything was overpriced. Ive been to other sushi restaurants in the area and the prices were comparable to boutique sushi restaurants. For a typical bento box it was 20$ or more. That didn't phase me too much..... until I was told the fish I wanted was not fresh....  I had already placed my order and paid and just wanted to rush out. When I ordered a miso soup I caught the workers sipping away at the pot to see if it was okay. Which was understandable because they didn't want to sell a bad product. But then I got home.... and opened the \"soup\" (which was just a stock), and could understand why they were going at that pot for 5 minutes. I had a bite of the sushi and the salmon had no flavour, which was extremely odd..... Needless to say I didn't eat and wouldn't go back there again. The service on the other hand was nice, they were very sweet people but I would question the prices and food quality."}
{"text":"We decided to try this sushi place because it's around the corner and the sushi craving hit hard.  On a Monday night we were the only customers, and all three employees came out to greet us.  We noticed the prices were on the higher side, and settled on the dynamite roll, spicy salamon maki, and an order of sashimi.  The food came out shortly after  we ordered.  The pieces were very large but the taste was lacking."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, and it is by far the best sushi resto in south Etobicoke, hands down. Always fresh sushi & sashimi, and delicious miso. Yes, the space is not fancy but for lunch or a casual dinner & take-out it is perfect!!!  (Period) On top of all this the owner is SO Nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service with VERY reasonable prices and a great lunch selection. Taste and freshness has been top notch - I haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy from here. Everything tastes great but my favourites are the spicy salmon roll and yam tempura."}
{"text":"I rarely go there to eat (not sure why, it's nice enough), but I have ordered delivery a few times and my guests always ask where I order them. They always compliment on how good the sushi tastes."}
{"text":"What did I just eat? It was such a mix of good and bad, I really don't know what just happened. I ordered the Moriwase Set A for $39.95 which is supposed to come with a mix of nigiri sushi, sashimi and two rolls (1 x California and 1 x what \"I think\" was a dynamite roll).  Here are my thoughts on each part:  - Nigiri sushi: each piece was very small overall (which I don't mind if it means I'm eating less white rice) but to make matters worse the pieces of fish were very thin  - Sashimi: Good in thickness but they chopped regular pieces in half. So one piece of good quality fish was cut into two to reach their promised number of pieces - not cool.  - California Roll: Meh  - Dynamite Roll: Tempura shrimp was soggy in spots, crunchy in others. They did a very thin layer of spicy mayo on top  Finally, the presentation was not very appealing, the pickled ginger looked brown and dry and the chef had used wilted browning romaine lettuce to add separation between the various elements of the set. Call me old-fashioned but give me the fake plastic grass for separation any day - at least it can't spoil.  Won't order here again... waste of money  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Sushis taste great, it would've been perfect if the service was a bit fast. This place deserves much more attention!"}
{"text":"I decided to go to Just Japan since the sushi place I normally go to was closed. I did not have high expectations for Just Japan but I was craving sushi.   I got takeout and when I picked it up the lady opened the sushi box and asked what kind of sauce I wanted on it. I was kind of confused since iv never been asked what sauce I wanted on my sushi. I said I did not care , whatever sauce she thought went with my rolls. She picked up the bottle and put a single drop of sauce on each roll. I thought that was odd, why ask me what sauce I want, then put such a tiny amount i can't taste it. Anyways, the sushi was not fresh at all and looked sloppy. Each roll was cut a different size and falling apart. I eat a lot of sushi and I have to say this was the worst sushi iv had. I don't want to be to harsh since it looks family owned but after eating it I wished I saved my money and made dinner."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give zero stars that's exactly what I would have done. This is easily hands down THE WORST SUSHI I'VE EVER EVER EATEN! On our way back we commented that we would have expected better quality sushi from the 7-11. It's impossible to overstate just how mediocre and lazy and tasteless this sushi was. We couldn't find any difference in taste amongst the rolls and we couldn't find any fish in them either. We are avid sushi lovers and have dined at many excellent and so-so sushi places around the world, but this takes the cake as the worst. I don't know whose idea it was for a double roll where you wrap your maki with an extra layer of rice and seaweed but it makes for an enormous tasteless 400 calorie bite. I am never ever coming back and advise anyone reading this to try literally any place else."}
{"text":"This place is a little on the ghetto side, and pretty far from a flash place to eat. But the sushi is actually super tasty, the staff/owners are really nice, and the variety is great.   The menu doesn't make much sense, and there are a bunch of rolls with no descriptions, but weird names. But we've been pretty happy with nearly everything from here, and it's a quiet place for a quick lunch in the area. Best to pick-up/deliver though, really.   Totally fair for the prices, the rolls are pretty big, and their vegetarian options are a bit of a switch from the regular fare. One of the better places in the area, for sure... just not necessarily by the look of it :)"}
{"text":"Small place, very close to a streetcar. The staff are generally pretty friendly from the 5+ times I've gone, but one time I asked for a refill of tea and the owner lady kind of glared at me so that was awkward! All the other times after have been decent and the food is fine too.  It's not the freshest but it's not super expensive for a lunch combo."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the neighborhood. Convenient and affordable for the area. Love going there for little takeouts."}
