{"text":"I never have been a big Hardee's fan but let me say, their food has improved tremendously and this location is very clean (compared to about 5-7 years ago). Workers very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 2 stars because its a Hardee's and they actually do a good job with their breakfast food.  The reason why they aren't getting 5 stars is because of the service.  I've been to this location a handful of times since it opened and it has always been slow.  Last weekend I waited in the drive thru for 15-20 minutes, that's not what I call Fast Food.

Saturday morning we stopped by to pick some food up before a day trip to the zoo.  I went in to order our food, by the time I walked in the door and got our food, 25 minutes had passed.  The only reason I didn't leave was because I promised my 3 year old a sausage biscuit from Hardee's.  While in the restaurant, another customer made a comment about something to the manager, the customer pulled the manager to the side so everyone else around could not hear, but as he turned to walk away he said, \"Whatever\", at that point the manager turned to walk back to the kitchen and said loud enough for everyone in line to hear her say \"yeah, whatever\".  I understand manager's get frustrated, but this manager was extremely rude.

This restaurant lost 10-15 customers in the time I was there due to slow service.

If you want fast food and polite service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, food has gone down hill, pricy for what you get, and I've never waited less than 15 mins in the drive thru even when I was the only car. If I could give it less than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to give ZERO stars, but it's not, so one star is it.

I'm not expecting much whenever I do fast food, but not much was exactly what I got at this Hardee's. My little nephew begged me to take him there for a hot dog, so like the doting Aunt I am, off we went to Hardee's.  I think it was the evening of October 2.

The place was filthy--sticky floors and unwashed tables.  Yuck.  There was one person ahead of us, who stood there forever before he was waited on.  I watched as a zombie-like clerk expended all of his energy in taking this man's order.  It was hard to watch.

Then it was our turn.  The zombie looked at us, turned on his heel and disappeared for a ridiculous amount of time.  I'm pretty sure we stood there five full minutes before a female zombie showed up.  With no attempt of a smile, and dull, glassy eyes, she asked, 'what do you want?'  Wow.  We placed our order, making sure she understood that we wanted a plain hotdog--nothing on it at all--with fries and a coke.  With all the effort she could muster, she collected our payment and turned and walked away.  No smile, no \"thank you,\" no \"that will be just a minute.\"  Nothing.

After about fifteen minutes, we went up to the counter to see what the delay was (considering we were only one of two customers in the building).  We showed the zombie our receipt, who took a very long time to read the receipt, before turning away and disappearing in the back.  Again, without a word.

Ten minutes later, she appeared with out hot dog.  Covered in mustard.  We reminded her that we asked for a plain hot dog, specifically stating we wanted nothing on it.  She mumbled, \"that's how our plain dogs are--with mustard.\"  She just didn't get it.  Rather than making the poor thing expend another ounce of energy, we asked her to remake the order with nothing on the dog, and to please not just wipe off the ketchup--make a new dog.  And also, where are the fries?  She rolled her eyes at that one.  I guess we were asking far too much of her.  Poor thing.

The new dog came back.  I use the term \"new\" loosely, as this poor dog was basically the consistency of vulcanized rubber.  And cold.  At this point, we'd been here about 45 minutes, and I was in no mood to deal with the incompetent zombies again.  My nephew stoically nibbled on the dog before asking if he could just eat his fries, to which I agreed, of course.

My nephew summed it up when he said, \"Aunt T, Hardee's was my favorite place before.  Is it ok if we never come back here again?\"  Of course, little man.  Never again."}
{"text":"A SNAILS PACE. Their still slower than ever. The move at a snails pace. I've watch grass grow faster than they make the food here. It's in no was fast food."}
{"text":"manager - please tell your employees not to wrap the burgers so tightly that it makes a bread ball!!!!
your burger rolls are not designed to be crushed by a careless employee. all i got was this / not in a bag to get crushed, but in my hand delivered like this:

unacceptable......... no bread balls!!!!"}
{"text":"Octavia was incredibly sweet and attentive. The restaurant was very clean and the food was much better than many of the other fast food restaurants around here. Thank you for being awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to update this review based on my visit today.  Had a coupon for $1 double cheeseburger which was good.  Place is pretty clean, and the employees working wash their hands often.  The woman working the register today knew what she was doing  too, so it wasn't as slow as usual.

Food is okay for a \"fast\" food joint.  \"Fast\" is in quotes because this is one of the slowest places you will ever eat at - fast food or not.  The people seem to be nice enough, but they don't have a clue as to what they are doing.  Every time I go here it takes about 10 minutes to get my food, even on a Monday evening with hardly any other people in there.  The only reason I go back is the burgers are halfway decent (although not as good as advertised) and they send out a plethora of coupons making meals very cheap.  The hand breaded chicken tenders are okay, but there is too much bread, not enough chicken, and the bread is rubbery."}
{"text":"The absolutely slowest \"FAST\" food place I have been to. 3 cats at 7:45 am and it took 10 minutes."}
{"text":"So I don't frequent fast food restaurants often, and it's usually because of the experience I just had.

A friend and I went through the drive through (it was just before 9:00pm). I tried to order chicken tenders and was told that they don't have anymore for this time of night. I know in fast food terms, that just means the employees have gotten lazy and stopped making them. Not even an apology. I was stuck ordering something I didn't even really want.

I ordered the nachos. Although there was a car in front of us, I do feel like waiting 15 minutes for our order was just far too long for a \"fast food\" restaurant. It's clear to me that this particular Hardees is just mismanaged and should probably be evaluated.

Also - just as a side note as to the attitude of the employees - lights were flickering on and off and so when I looked inside, one of the employees gave me a very discomforting look."}
{"text":"Sharron Was The Cashier.   Walked By Me A Few Times Before Greeting In A Less Than Enthused Manner.   When I Walked Up $10 Was On The Counter.   About 5 Min Later Cashier,  Sharron,   Came And Picked Up And Put In Drawer.   After Ordering food Did Cone Pretty Quick But Looked Less Than Appetizing!   Bacon Was Wet And Limp With Only 3 Small Slices.   Lobby and Eating Area Could Use A Wipe Down And Sweeping. Not Likely To Return!"}
{"text":"Worst drive-thru I've ever been to, mostly because in the three times I gave this sorry excuse for a restaurant a chance, twice it screwed up!  The first time they didn't give me half my food and I had to go back for the rest.  The second time we pulled up to the drive-thru with three hours to spare and sat there for three minutes waiting for someone to come to the speaker.  When they didn't, I tried to go in to order food.  THE DOORS WERE LOCKED!  Yet when someone else approached the window they instantly took their order!  Complained to corporate, which trickled down to regional, which got passed to the restaurant itself.  Their response?  Basically \"Oh well.  We don't give a crap.\"  I give you two tries then that's it.  Don't bother with this place.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Been craving a Carl's Junior burger since I moved to the east coast 18 years ago. 

Was surprised by my wife and son today with Hardee's.

Long story short, it is a long drive to Fort Mill for a fast food dinner. even though they where slow and they still screwed up the order. Only one burger was what my wife and son ordered. She just ran out to get my son something he will eat at Jack in the Box. 

We won't be back to this Hardee's, shame."}
{"text":"5-21. So I wanted a biscuit and gravy this morning not sure why I came here but nothing has changed. I walk in stood at the counter while the drive through cashier was handing an order out the window to the only car in the drive through as I was the only customer in line for food. He stayed over by the window and looked at me and the cook was all caught up with about 50 biscuits on display behind the counter. Not one person said MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER.  What is wrong with such a brain dead society. People have absolutely no sense of urgency or even common courtesy to do the job they are hired to do. Enough said I walked out and drove 5 miles up to Tega Cay and went to Bojangles I went through the drive through and 1 minute and 30 seconds I had 5 biscuits and gravy 6 OJs and a Chicken biscuit. Hardee's go study how Bojangles operates or better yet try emulating a ChicK-fil-A"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, you cannot give zero stars! The last time I ate in this particular Hardee's I want to hotdog. It was so overcooked and dry and they acted like they didn't even care and I ended up getting sick and throwing up. I suspected that the hotdog might've been sitting there for quite a while because of the rubbery texture, but I just didn't feel like complaining because I figured I get more of the same. They need new management. There are six dollar burgers used to be outstanding. I only live a few blocks from there and I wouldn't ever step foot in that place again and less I saw that it was under new management or ownership."}
