{"text":"Horrible service. The food took a very long time to be ready and when it was ready it was cold. When I asked for it to be heated the waiter was very rude to me. I felt disrespected."}
{"text":"Where to find a slice of pizza on a Monday afternoon? I am happy to say Pizza Old Roma in downtown Glendale has a great slice, The Greek - Gyro meat black and green olives, fresh sliced tomato, feta and pepperchini! They are located on the north east corner of Glendale and 58th Ave. Not next to the comic book store as Yelp first advised. Nice old town feel and sweetheart cook. Happy stomach and soothed soul. ( ="}
{"text":"Great pizza! Went as a team, from Small Business Financials, as part of the Lunch Mob with the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. We will be back, soon!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today for the first time and loved it. As I ordered a calzone the staff did mention it was not a New York style but their own version, I loved it. It is a smalL homey place where you can enjoy great food and people watch out the front window. The staff were great and friendly, I have a new calzone home! I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I loooovvveeee this place. If I have to pick a favorite pizza place, this is it! It's a little mom and pop shop so when I first went there I was ready to be easy on them. Ya know, maybe they ran out of certain stuff, maybe they are busy and flustered...They aren't a chain or have multiple locations so I know they may need some areas to improve. But, damn.... damn good pizza. The guy was really cool, down the earth. I picked up a salad and some pepperoni pizza. So delicious! Even my brother who is SUPER picky about pizza loved it (An amazing feat because I kid you not he makes me drive to scottsdale sometimes for his favorite chinese food. So picky). I will always recommend this and can't wait to stop in again."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever had.  I ordered a slice of cheese.  The guy served it to me straight from the pizza warmer.  The pizza was luke-warm to cold and the cheese was still congealed.  The cheese was separated from the crust, so the bread part had the consistency of slimey bread.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Old Roma's is the best place for pizza in Glendale. Better than Chain restaurants and all the other Mom-Pop shops. The atmosphere is very homely and warm. The only thing is, when they tell you that your plate is hot, that means it's HOT! :) Great Place though, worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had a really poor experience here. The place is very old and that makes it look very dirty. There were flies buzzing around the restaurant. The bathroom was so disgusting that I walked back out. Our pizza took over an hour and there were not enough people there to warrant it taking so long. The pizza was missing some toppings too. Overall, the pizza wasnt very good. We haven't gone back and probably never will."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great pie, the crust was so light and fluffy that you know they have they hand-tossed secret figured out. Normally a crust that looks like theirs does has a certain texture. Theirs is different, in a very good way, very airy and tasty! You have to try to understand....  I was part of the Small Business Financials team that visited this site with the Glendale Chamber of Commerce.   We brought a large amount of business into this small establishment and they handled this challenge with ease. Great crew!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place.  The pizza is amazing, wings are too.  Definitely where I go when I am in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"This place gives me exactly what I want from a pizza.  Freshly made dough, fresh veggies (for when I am pretending to eat healthy), cheese that is grated in house.  Add the bottled beer selection and you shouldn't really need anything else.    Laid back atmosphere, and free Wi-Fi.  I read the reviews for this place before I decided to add this one.  I have been a few times and haven't been disappointed.  If you have not yet done so, stop in for a slice if you want a snack, or a whole pie if you are in the market for a meal.    There is an item that is not on the menu board, and if you are bold enough, ask about \"The 100 pounder\""}
{"text":"Really good pizza. The sauce is a little on the sweet side but matched well with the crust and fresh toppings. Red onion, green pepper and pepperoni. The crust was not too think or too thin and the cheese was melted perfectly. The price is defiantly right by the slice or the pie. An added bonus is the free parking garage a block and a half away - and a great comic book store across the street."}
{"text":"I live very near down town Glendale and have always wanted to try their pizza, well last week I finally did. The fact that it was empty should have told me something. I have to say that it was no better than pizza hut, dominos, or other chains. The salad was not exactly fresh, the dressing tasted funny. The pizza had a great crust but that is all I really liked. Will not be returning..."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. The pizza was good and the service was fine.  Good place for a somewhat quick bite to eat. One bad thing i will say is that Im not a big fan of bringing your kids to work.  That kinda made me uneasy."}
{"text":"The pizza this evening was good, not as good as previous times.  Tonight the sauce and crust were bland. Used to be a little sweeter.  Will still return again."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. First time stopping but would again if had opportunity. Nothing fancy just good pizza and friendly."}
{"text":"My kids love coming here anytime we're in downtown Glendale and are in the mood for pizza we come here. Prices are not that bad I paid for my youngest and I about 16 bucks. I got large drink 2 cheese pizza and 6 piece wings. Food has always been great.they have seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has positive reviews...  GF and I ordered two slices and salads and the pizza came out of a rotisserie warmers that a gas station would use.  God knows how long it was in that warmer.... Unfortunately it tasted like a long time...  The store itself had different style booths, a tv in the corner with the plug hanging next to it unplugged, and a cool old fashioned Pepsi sign on another wall, again with the plug hanging next to it...  On another wall theres a picture frame with openings for multiple 5x7 photos but instead of photos, one opening has the thermostat, two were blank and the last one framed the holes in the wall.    Kinda gives you an impression that financially, things aren't so great.  I would say I would give it another chance but I don't see that this place has anymore to give... and I think it took too much considering I can't un-see the what I've seen."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Excellent service! We arrived famished and a little grouchy after waiting for an hour and never receiving our meals at The Hop Stop;  we were so hungry that I told our server we needed our food fast! He told us their pizzas take 10 minutes to prepare and he was right! The man who prepared our food was fun to talk to and took time to just chat, which was nice!  We met the owner and were shown a new piece of art they are going to hang up.  We ordered a large pepperoni and black olive pizza and it was delicious! The crust was the perfect thickness and had a great flavor, the sauce was perfect and not over-powering. Pepperoni and olives are always great! My brother, who was with us,  is a caterer and knows good food so the fact that he raved about the pizza should be proof enough to anyone reading this that the pizza was not ordinary. Thank you, Pizza Old Roma for a quick but delicious meal!"}
{"text":"awesome little hole in the wall!!!!  we each ordered one single piece of pizza, expecting them to be taken from a pizza already made.. nope!!!  each piece was made fresh to order and they were SO SO GOOD!!!!  happy we came across this little place!"}
{"text":"Great place for a causal slice.  Not world class, but great for what it is.  The staff was friendly and the outdoor seating worked well to chat and people watch.  Good food, great value."}
{"text":"First let me say the don't have coke products was about to say no to my boyfriend because of it but so glad I didn't. Pizza was amazing we had the large pepperoni. It was fresh out of the oven and it was absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had. We also tired the mozzarella sticks and wings because we like to try it all lol. The wings were very good if you like them hot go with the hot if not I would recommend the medium. The mozzarella sticks were delicious!! Seriously a great place to eat. The only bad things (bedside the coke thing lol) is their ac was out so it was a little warm to sit there but seeing as we live in AZ I didn't mind it helped burn the calories lol. Still worth it for me to eat here it was great we will be coming  again"}
{"text":"Love this little pizza joint!!! My bf and I came and ordered calzones and they were delicious....you can put up to SIX toppings for same price (so awesome!!!), so we had sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom. It was very very good, my daughter and I split ours because it's that big...very worth it and prices are reasonable. Next time I'm coming for the pizza because they make it from scratch and you do have to wait a little but who cares it's so worth the wait....because you know you're getting it  FRESH :-) This little restaurant has about maybe 10 tables inside but what I love is the old glendale scenery, if you want to eat outside and enjoy the weather they have a few tables out which reminds me of Italy. Nice place to chill and relax guys"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Yummy pizza and really good service. a friend ordered the wings and raved about them. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little local pizzeria, popular place.  It is casual and inexpensive.  Pizza slices seem to be made to order, instead of throwing items atop a slice and re-heating it like other places.  My 5 year old says \"It is SO Yummy, it's delicious!\" and I must agree.  He inhaled his cheese slice faster than I've ever seen him eat a pizza before."}
{"text":"Came because the German restaurant didn't open until 4pm. Best...decision...ever!  Even though the inside is small, the Greek pizza we had was huge on flavor. From ordering to eating, we only had about 10-15 minute wait for all the food to arrive in all its fresh from the oven glory.  I'll be back here again soon."}
{"text":"The pizza was good pizzeria pizza. No real service. Go to the counter, order your meal and drink, collect your plastic utensils and paper napkin and find a place to sit down.  Clean, but nothing special. If I'm in the area and hungry again, I'll go here if my favorites aren't open."}
{"text":"After spending a hot afternoon antiquing in town, this pizzeria looked like the most convenient place to grab a quick bite. The dining area is minimal but clean, and the servers are very friendly. I ordered two cheese pizzas with pepperoni--all their pizzas appear to be cheese and toppings are extra--with a drink (they carry Pepsi products). The pizza came out hot and greasy, like one would expect from a good pizzeria, and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"ROCKSTARS like me, who like eating some BIG FAT GREASY DELICIOUS STEAMING PEPPERONI Pizza, dripping with some hot melted mozzarella cheese and an ice cold drink should stop and have a meal here! Every Wednesday I come in, order 2 slices of cheese pizza, a side salad and a small drink for about 5.50 ! I often add pepperoni, but for a dollar less you can eliminate the side salad. Who eats something healthy like a salad anyways when you are about to eat something that will bring your mouth full of flavorgasms of delight?  Rockstars always do something to set them apart! One thing you can do is try Manzanita Sol (Apple Soda) on the fountain drink, I can't think of any other places that has that, so it separates this place apart from the rest, also,  I don't mind a small cup since I always get free refills, why should I pay for a bigger one? Right?  If you are eating with friends, since all ROCKSTARS have friends, get a large Roma Supreme for under $20 ! That's the true way to go!   The guy Colby who works here, super cool dude.  Major props to him always!  ROCKSTARS DON'T  buy from a pizza chain, keep those Arizona dollars in state and get a pizza here!"}
{"text":"took my 2 sons to eat after getting hair cut. boys sai pizza was best they have ever."}
{"text":"I grew up eating in this joint when it was at Valley West Mall... decided to take a trip down memory lane. Things have changed, the pizza is round now!  Otherwise it's as I remember, very hot and very good. Staff is friendly and helpful, the shop is clean and we'll maintained.   Very happy to have stopped by and will again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after I did some field experience at the school nearby. I've been by this place before but I decided to try it out today. That and I was really craving some pizza.  The place is a nice little shop and the man behind the counter was super nice. We actually had a conversation and I wasn't rushed away like some other places. Luckily for me, they were making a batch of cheese pizza so I was going to get the first hot slice.  The guy brought me my pizza and it was pretty delicious. It wasn't the best pizza in the world but it was a million times better than any pizza chain out there. If you're into atmosphere, it is very casual. A great place to have a date night or get together with some friends.  I probably should have got a meal deal because it would have been cheaper. Luckily there will be a next time because I really dig the pizzas they're making. So glad I came here for a slice."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch the other day after walking by dozens of times over the years.  I had 2 slices of pepperoni lunch special.  Pizza was hot and fresh and very good and tasty.  I've been to places where the lunch-slices are sitting out for a while and are like wet cardboard, but  not here.  Will eat here anytime I have a chance!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Glendale!  I came here with a bunch of friends in high school and fell in love. Now I am out of high school and still loving this place. I bring my daughter here all the time.  I always get pepperoni but I have tried the greek pizza with chicken and it is so good!! There is a small 5-10 minute wait, but that is only because they make the pizza fresh to order. Wouldn't go anywhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza Old Roma is an excellent establishment in downtown Glendale.  The owner, Kolby, is a great guy, and is super personable with all his customers.  He's got some really good lunch specials, or you can buy a whole pie.  Definitely check it out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the first review we have ever written.  The experience we had was the worst we ever had, and felt it was needed to inform others, at least as a warning.  Yesterday we were waiting for La Piazza (if that is how it is spelt) to open for dinner, and we were starved.  So we crossed the street to have a little appetizer.  We ordered chicken wings.    The discomfort set in when we watched the kid behinde the counter place the wings that looked like they were cooked yesterday, into an oven to warm them.  They were in there abour 4 minutes when he removed them, went into the back and came out a minute later with sauce on them.  I thought maybe they just prep them in the morning and store them well, so getting them ready when they are ordered is a little faster.  I'm actually ok with that.  We took our first bite, and realized it needed to exit our mouths quickly! The bitting and spitting into a napkin happened in sync.  The chicken was not only cold in the middle and burn on the outside.  It was the texture (and same moisture level) of old jerky.  I'm not kidding that these wings had to have been cooked at least 48 hours earlier than they were served, and left out on the side walk to dehydrate.  I'm not just saying that it was dry chicken.  This explanation is not exagerated.  I don't litterally think it was left on the side walk, but the chicken resembled what it would be if it had!   We were so disturbed we left (after explaining the horror to the kid behinde the counter, and refusing our refund, just to leave as soon as possible).    WORST EVER!!!  NEGATIVE 1000 STARS! I'm thinking of calling who ever needs to be called when a restaurant is serving harmful food."}
{"text":"Okay... this is going to be a tricky review. My boyfriend and I usually get pizza for dinner every few weeks, and sometimes we venture from our usual spots. I remember trying this place years ago, if I remember correctly, a coworker said her son owned it.  Anyway... this pizza place is located in Old Town Glendale, right by where events such as Glendale Glitters occur. I love coming to the stores and shops nearby, because I don't live more than a couple miles away and I drive through the area to get to work.  On our first visit, we ordered pizza and wings to go, and we asked for the pizza to be well done. We looked around, they have seating inside and in a patio area that is shared with the neighboring Java spot.  The pizza and wings smelled amazing and smelled even better during the drive home. We normally eat up to two slices each- but I think we ate all but two slices this time! The pizza is just wicked good! I went back a few weeks later and got another pizza, not knowing if it would be at the same level. Well, it was and we smashed it once we got home, nom, nom! I think we ate the entire pizza that day, but good thing we got it right around lunchtime."}
{"text":"There was a line out of the door for pizza when I arrived.  I took a look at the menu and there were a few different pizza flavors that looked good.  So, I stood in line for a very long time.  When I got to the front of the line, I placed my order.  The person behind the counter said \"We don't have that kind tonight.\"  So, I ordered another flavor.  \"Uh, we don't have that kind either.\"  So, I asked, \"Which flavors are available tonight?\"  She said: \"We just have pepperoni tonight.\"  Super, super disappointing as I was extremely hungry and walked quite awhile to get there.  It would have been helpful to post a sign on the big menu saying, \"We only have pepperoni tonight and do not have this long list of other options.\""}
{"text":"This place has everything I like in a small pizza joint.  Pizza by the slice-check Small salads & Wings-check All you can drink soda-check An inviting dining area with two nerds playing Dungeons & Dragons in the corner-super check  If your in downtown Glendale & want a quick slice of pizza then you owe it to yourself to check it out."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Stopped in this little place in old town Glendale...as we were right around the corner for 2 graduations...the employees were fantastic and helpful! Ordered half meat trio and half veggie and it was so great...perfect topping to cheese and sauce ratio..crust was thin and crunchy ..totally worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"We frequent here when activites are happening downtown. I love the gyro pizza and my daughter could not get enough of the pineapple one! My husband always tries something new. Super yummy. The insides are pretty divy but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Ok gatta say, \"Hell Yeah\"!! Finally found some good A** Pizza!! My bro at work told me bout this place. Had to check it out! Even thou its in Old Town Glendale an i live in Suprise! But worth the trip. All the ingredients was fresh, with the right amount of cheese an sauce! Got the wings an they was banging too!! The whole experience was good! The staff seemed really nice!! An the price wasnt bad at all! Plus it was cleaner than most stores you just walk in. So YES I will be back!! Over an Over again!! LoL. Its worth the stop!!! An parking isn't hard to find. But you might have to walk a little distance! Still worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"Love this cozy pizza place for their friendly service, by-the-slice options, and mozzarella sticks. The prices are great, the pizza is delicious, and they have patio seating in the shade in a cute courtyard right in the best part of downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday. Couldn't decide if I wanted to go here or the other pizza place that's literally right down the block. Came on Yelp and saw that this place is cheaper and has fountain drinks. I didn't feel like spending lots of money so I thought I'd give this place a try. Got the two slices and a soda combo for $7.00. They didn't have any pizza lying around so they made it fresh for us. Pizza was really good. Would I say it's the best I've ever had? No. Best in Glendale.. I haven't tried all the pizza places in Glendale, so no. But it's pretty good if you just want a couple slices and not a whole box."}
{"text":"Wasn't planning on coming here, but the food at the chocolate fair was overpriced and gross looking.  So i walked in and had an okayish salad and a tasty pizza. this place also had live music but it was of poor quaility ."}
{"text":"This is good cheap pizza for those moments when you don't care whether the mozzarella came from buffaloes who had their hooves massaged daily -- you simply want lunch to be cheap, pleasant, filling, and served politely.  The decor that emphasizes vintage Volkswagen buses, presumably to remind the Glendale retirees of eating pizza like this when they were students at UC Berkeley, between protests. This is a very good pizza to fill you up, ridiculously cheap, when you're exhausted from a hot day of protesting.  It tastes like good, ordinary pizzeria pizza slices used to taste, back before pizza was a gourmet thing. The crust is thin, mildly salty, and pleasant enough that I ate all of it, though not in the vein of uttermost crust rhapsodies, more with the \"don't mind me, nothin' here to see\" feel of eating the broken cookie bits from the Chips Ahoy package. Don't order the ham on your slice, as it's unexciting ham: get pepperoni or sausage. Toppings are 26 cents each on slices, and the slices are large, so it's quite economical to get exactly what you want, though with slices of this consistency, I would stop at a maximum of four toppings. A fork's likely to be wanted, unless you believe in doing pizza-slice origami.  I've gone back and forth between three and four stars because it's fairly ordinary pizza, but it's ordinary in a good way, and if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably eat here a lot. My eating the crust justifies the higher rating, as does their delightfully old school method of having customers make iced-tea by pouring tea from a hot-pot with teabags over ice."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast and affordable. Old style slices. Loved it. Been here many times. Def worth the visit."}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot if you're looking for local, inexpensive pizza. Personally, I find this to be a bit on the salty side, and the tart sauce doesn't help with that. However, I always have to appreciate a good pie made fresh by people who care.   Prices are insanely low. You could probably feed two people for under $10. I appreciate that it's very clean, and that one time, they delivered it across the street to my friends and I at OTG Wine Bar. Glendale is slowly being invaded by chains like -bertos an Caramba's. Join the resistance and give this place a try."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch today and was so happy I finally did! This might be the most authentic to east coast pizza I've ever had in AZ! The crust was perfectly floppy and something about the tanginess of the blend of the sauce they use and the type(s) of cheese that was perfection. They came together reminding my taste buds of my fav pizza from home!  I'm not sure what you do differently from every other pizza shop in AZ but please - don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Not like the Roma Pizza of my Childhood but SUPER delicious nonetheless. The people are super friendly, the pizza crust is light and airy and the sauce is super old school delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We got three slices of sausage pizza for ~$7.  It was super cheesy!  Very tasty, and a great price to boot."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have ordered by the slice as well as a fresh baked pie. I hadn't been there in 2 years though, so when some friends and I decided to go to Glendale Glitters, I was very excited to have to opportunity to come back and eat here. Even when ordering by the slice (when the pizza has been sitting out and reheated) the pizza always tastes fresh and the crust has the perfect crunch. When we got there this last time the line was out the door. The staff never missed a beat and was fast and friendly. The restaurant was packed and noisy, but the restaurant was clean and staff made sure they were heard when they called our names.  I should come back more often!"}
{"text":"I can walk to this place for lunch for my work so I've been here a few times.  It's a tiny place with around 8 booths.  They have lunch specials with slices and salads.  I usually get the two slices of cheese.  It's pretty good.  I always recommend getting a fresh pizza but the slices are good if you're by yourself.  I really like the flavor of the sauce and the crispy crust.  The guys who work  there are quick and relatively friendly.  I think they only deliver on weekends.  I've never tried the pastas and I've had a basic garden salad which was nothing to write home about.  But I do like their pizza and recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"2 big slices of pepperoni pizza for 2.75, just can't beat that... great flavor all around. So good I ate the crust, which I rarely do.  Awesome employees, very friendly.  Will definitely be going back regularly, very happy I gave this place a try...  Highly recommended to all."}
{"text":"Indie pizza places always warm my heart Tables outside on an alley remind me of Paris But I know I'm in America because the soda has free refills"}
