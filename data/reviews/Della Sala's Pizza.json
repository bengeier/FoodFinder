{"text":"This pizza is fantastic.  The owners are real nice and everytime I come home, that is the first thing that we get.  I am visiting next week and I can't wait.  The price is right, the food is great.  Cash only.  Sicillian, which means square."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from them for the 1st time on Saturday 12/3/11... And it was not the best at all. I had stated on the phone that I have never ordered before so I wasn't sure what type of crust they had. The man on the phone said that they only had one so it did not matter. I ordered a large which is a 16 cut and they are square.. Not round. I picked it up in the given time of 15 minutes and noticed that it came in two different boxes. When I opened it at home it did not look done. The cheese was only have melted. The pepperoni did not look cooked just oily. Because bread, cheese and sauce is good no matter how you eat it, the pizza was edible. The dough seemed to be very chewy though. The next day we baked it in our oven for 10 minutes and it was much better. The crust was actually crisp and the cheese was fully melted. I will not order this pizza again... There r many different pizza shoppes that serve better pizza."}
{"text":"Grew up on this pizza. Hometown favorite! Best Sicilian pizza out of a garage. Toppings overflow on this pizza and it's always fresh. You can also take it home raw to cook yourself. Family owned and operated. I believe it's cash only."}
{"text":"Its the best in the burg. The sausage is to die for. I like sausage & anchovies on mine.the price is right.its worth the trip."}
{"text":"I know a lot of places get reviews like the one I am about to post, but I mean this from the bottom of my heart;

THEIR PIZZA IS THE BEST PIZZA IN THE PITTSBURGH AREA.

At first, I was a bit weary of this shop. You have to drive through a residential area in Verona and then you'll arrive at a little white garage. I was afraid of what I was getting into. My first impression was that it looks a bit run down from the outside (but these the types of places where the best food is born). 

My first time ever I ordered two boxes of the half baked pizza and I must have ate a whole box on my way home. You're supposed to finish baking it when you get home but it didn't get that far. The cheese, the dough, the everything is amazing. It's a hike from where I live but it's worth it every single time. So far I've gotten a few other people swearing it's the best pizza they ever had."}
{"text":"Dellla Salas is a legendary spot...cash only, best pizza around. Been going here for years and its just as good every time. Super reasonable, couple slices is only a few bucks. Absolute hometown favorite."}
{"text":"Garage pizza.  The ultimate yinzer experience.  I visit every time I am home:)"}
{"text":"Damn good Sicilian pizza! Probably the best in Pittsburgh! 

This is a cash only take out joint. If you don't have GPS drive slow or you'll go right past it. I think it used to be a auto repair garage as the kitchen is Smurf small. No matter where we go for pizza whether it's Cafe Milano, Minneo's, Napoli's, Vento's, Giovonni's, Pizza Parma etc. we get the same thing. Pepperoni, mushroom and extra cheese so we didn't need to look at a menu. When we pulled up a guy in the car next to us was having a make out session with his pizza. His windows were all fogged up. He was gettin' down! My wife went in and ordered our pizza and ten minutes later we were on our way. We got a large which was 16 cuts and cost about $21. 

The pizza is outstanding! Once it cools down a little I would advise you to remove it from the pizza box to prevent the bottom of the pizza from sticking to the pizza box."}
{"text":"This is not burgher king! Square Pizza by the slice coming out the garage. I highly recommend getting pepperoni and sausage on your slices. I also love the way the pizza is packaged in a little box. One of the greatest pizzas in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I read many good reviews for this place so I had to check it out.  I called today and got 4 slices for lunch to try.  I got 4 cuts for less that $4!!  So first impression, the price point is fantastic.

They only serve sicilian style and the crust was great.  Very buttery and cooked perfectly.  The sauce wasn't very sweet and had a good flavor.  I hate when pizza sauce tastes like it's loaded with sugar.  My least favorite aspect of the pizza was the cheese.  It tasted much like what comes on a cheap frozen pizza.  

Overall, I'd be willing to order again-perhaps with extra sauce and extra cheese to make up for the overbearing (but still delicious) crust.  You can't go wrong with the price and supporting a small business.  Side note: this place looks scary as hell.  It looks like a dirty mechanics garage and the signage in front is amateur at best.  It's truly what's inside that counts in this case."}
{"text":"The best sicillian pizza around! Cheap prices and sold by the slice. No seating, just walk in and walk out."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and got pizza and bought a couple of their TSHIRTS :) This place is legendary since 1959......The pizza is excellent and very very unique.......you won't find this taste matched anywhere- it stands alone......the crust, the sauce, the cheese and toppings- all add up to a unique pizza that's wayyyyyyyyyy superior to the 'cookie-cutter chains'......all them franchise pizzas taste the same, more or less........THIS pizza is just terrific and unlike any other......I just love this place......my whole life ! ......I was waited on by a very nice guy and the lady who got me my tshirts was a really kind, sweet person....If you are REALLY a pizza-lover.......ya GOTTA try this place.....if you are traveling along Allegheny River Blvd.....you can easily make a turn and get on VERONA ROAD and find the place in a minute......it's worth the drive......of course, you are reading a review from a person who once drove 10 hours to Boston to try a pizza !!!!!! But ya........check it out......I just love this place.......great pizza....reallllllly nice, good people."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza!!  Not a thing about it has ever changed.  I always get half baked and buy extras because it's never enough to have it one night!  Way to go Mr D"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've ever had. The customer service was the best part of my experience though. They gave me a job recommendation to Pat McAfee from the Indianapolis Colts and barstool sports. Pat is from Pittsburgh and close with the owners. That man knows his pizza better than just about anybody else so if he gives it five stars, you know this place is worth a try. Make sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza, My wife used to get it and i was never a fan but after a while of not having it you realize that you crave it and have to have it.  Weither you get it cooked, half baked or cold its great because the next day if you take it to work and microwave it the pizza tastes exactly the same.  Try it once and you will crave it.  Bonus, did I mention its cheap.
Bring cash as it is the only way to pay"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a kid! Consistent quality, and just plain delicious while also being a bit addictive. Their pizza is sicilian style and light as air, which I think is much better than when sicilian pizza is too dense. The outside can be easily mistaken for a garage and I have passed it up by accident. I love it!"}
{"text":"You've tried the rest, now try the BEST! 
Cash only. The best pepperoni & hot sausage pizza
on the planet, IMO. Now I got to go pick up some!"}
{"text":"Pizza sold by the slice (square). Sicilian style pizza.  Very good crust and sause.  If you like sausage on pizza its the best hot sausage ive had on pizza in a very long time.  I would recommend it and will be going back. Staff is very nice and polite.  It is cash only"}
{"text":"The absolute best Sicilian pizza in Pittsburgh.  I've enjoyed this pizza for over 35 years having grown up on it.

I usually buy 30-40 cuts that are half baked to take home and freeze for later.  Simply the best crust, sauce, and cheese around.

There's always room for Della Sal's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super hole in the wall place. Easily mistaken for an autobody shop, if it's your first time use GPS.  Dont let the dingy surroundings turn you away!  The pizza is top notch, and seems they prefer you buy by the slice. Pepperoni and sausage is a must try.  You can make any combo with the basic choices.  I also did peppers, mushroom, and bacon.  They pile on toppings, so 2 to 3 at most is best.  The slices come only in squares, and the bread is nice (not too doughy). Best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh!"}
