{"text":"I found this place a few years back and I must say, this review is past due. I have been on a mission to find the best sushi place that is delicious and worry free of breaking the bank.  And this is the place for me! Their all you can eat sushi is the best, somedays the fish is obviously a little more fresh than others but all in all it is still damn good. The service on the other hand....ehhh not so great as the food. The younger servers seem to be a little nicer and attentitive, whereas the older women tend to come off as annoyed or pissed off (especially when you go in a group of 4 or more), so I'm always glad when I don't have them as my waitress."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers to Orient for the last 4-5 yrs. Until recently we would've given them 5 stars, they barely deserve one anymore. 
They used to have 3 servers who knew us by name and also had our regular order memorized. The service and food were perfect. Slowly they have all disappeared and now it seems like the servers are brand new each time. I'm guessing the turn over rate is due to the Manager/Owner lady, who is always so angry and rude, speaks broken english which is impossible to understand and has the worst energy ever. 
We have recommended this place to lots of friends and family over the years because we loved the food, it was always consistently good. Now it tastes different every single time. The service is horrible. They get every order wrong. They don't refill drinks. They don't bring plates or chopsticks, and worst of all they make you wait the longest for the bill! 
THAT LADY IS RUINING THAT PLACE!! 
Someone tell her to check out YELP if you're lucky enough to meet her."}
{"text":"I love this place for their delicious Dynamite Sushi... for their Wonton Soup (no pork)... walnut shrimp and honey chicken...
The place is cozy, and they just expanded the space... and then, the best thing is you can get a beer for 1 CENT, on Friday & Saturday night... ;o)"}
{"text":"For my sushi cravings to take home I choose this place. They are always nice and their service is quick. The food is so tasty that I go there once a week!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the service sucks. Always busy, but they are always short staffed. Servers need to get a better attitude and understand that service is everything. Tipping is about service. I will continue going back to see if they are getting it right."}
{"text":"Orient sushi is delicious and the prices are amazing. The Chandler roll is by far my favorite. The service is speedy as well."}
{"text":"$20 all you can eat, pretty good food. The salmon is really tasty and the server me and my girlfriend had was an excellent waiter, one of the best we had. Quick, friendly and he delivered food timely. Overall great food and great environment."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed. This is our 5th or 6th time eating in and countless times getting takeout.  The all-you- can eat sushi is a great value if you are hungry. Ingredients and fish are always fresh and tasty. We recommend all of their house special rolls especially the Dynamite roll. Aside from the great sushi orient sushi grill offers a wide variety of Asian dishes not just Japanese. Our favorite standout dish is the Thai coconut curry. We usually order with shrimp but chicken has been tasty too. Both brown and white rice are nice. Ice tea is the best!"}
{"text":"We love Orient Sushi.  We have been going here since the restaurant opened up.  We have done take-out, all you can eat, lunch specials you name it.  The quality of the fish has always been good, the service is also very good.  They even know my husband by name from all of the take-out orders we have done over the years.  My kids now are old enough to start enjoying sushi and they love it here too.  

The food is fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the prices are very reasonable.  My favorite is the Norway Roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! 

The prices are totally reasonable; all sushi is 50% off all of the time. So I think an avocado roll ends up being around $2.50 (which I still love as a former vegetarian) but the fancier rolls (like to Tootsie Roll) only go up to like $6.00. The pieces are a good size too, I've been to a lot of sushi places that have great prices then you get the sushi and it's a total disappointment. It's definitely not like that here. And it's great because with their prices as cheap as they are, we got to choose a whole bunch of rolls and our bill was only like $30.

They also have this dish called Bonsai Noodles, you can choose what kind of meat you want in it (we chose seafood), how spicy you want it, and what kind of noodles you want in it. It was AMAZING - and hearty like a gumbo. And the portion is gigantic. We had so much left over! 

The penny beers are pretty sweet, too!

The only reason I'd take a point off is that the service is a little slow. Not that we're not willing to wait. And for some strange reason, every time I go they get my drink order wrong. One time I ordered a diet coke and got a Dr. Pepper. Another time I ordered an Arnold Palmer and got a Green Tea. No big deal, but a little odd.

Anyway, Orient Sushi rocks. I just hope with their prices like they are they can afford to stick around!!"}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer and love the sushi here. I typically dine-in. I decided to order sushi and was told it would take 45 minutes to deliver, my order arrived 1hr and 15 minutes later. When I proceeded to tip the driver $7.00 of 22.53 bill, he looked at me and said \"that's it!!\" Are kidding me?!? 

Like I said, the food is good. But the delivery service is not."}
{"text":"My fianc√© & I are regulars here. We've brought family in too & they liked it a lot as well. We always just order the rolls. Our favorites are the Chandler, Elliot, Rainbow, Seafood Dynamite, & spicy yellowtail. Our son really likes their Kung Pao chicken. Their Miso's good too. Highly recommend. We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"So I haven't reviewed anything in a whiles, but my experience at Orient is deserving. My bf and I stopped in for what we thought would be a quick, 20 min takeout pickup order, but boy were we wrong. 

Orient was quite the happening spot during prime Friday din hours (1 cent beers, 3 max), so we thought that was a good sign when entering. However, after 50 mins of waiting for our order (utterly RIDICULOUS!!), i would probably eat my own hand and it would taste relatively good. Yes, I did complain about the extreme wait, but it was apparent they put all of the takeout patrons on the back burner, while serving the dine-in's first (a man next to us was waiting equally long). After passing us multiple times, the owner finally stepped in and apologized and offered us a beer while we waited (big spender! *1 cent might i remind you*).

In their defense, we had a fairly large order - 1 app, 2 soups, 4 main entrees, and an udon dish, yet nothing unmanageable or 50 mins forgiving! 

Prices were very cheap (entrees ranged from $7.50-9), but would I choose this over its counterpart i.e. Pei Wei? Hell no. We ordered the crab puffs, hot and sour soup, Special Japanese Udon, Spicy Sun Devil, Garlic Mayo Shrimp, Orange Peel Chicken, and a Pepper Steak. The Udon and Shrimp were the best bets, as the others underpleased and were mediocre. Would I return? Possibly if there were no other options, but the service and lack of \"wow\" food would suggest otherwise."}
{"text":"Best Sushi on the Eastside, the owner and all the staff are on top of it great service.    but the sushi is great."}
{"text":"Love this place.  great sushi with a great price!  service is awesome!   only knock.i would give it is the tempura ice cream.  big frozen block of ice cream covered in way to much tempura batter."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and wanted to rate them for a while but I didn't have a yelp account yet.  I have to say that the food is delicious!! (I only get the sushi) and service is usually pretty good. Although there is an older lady there who isn't too friendly. She dresses like she is at home, I'm guessing the owner? But all the servers and sushi chefs are cool. They have Music playing at an enjoyable tone if you're sitting in the TV area."}
{"text":"AYCE is worth it. Try the chicken lettuce rap, salmon hand roll, tempura, seaweed salad, and calamari."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time because my daughter recommend it.   They have the best hot and sour soup!  I also love their teriyaki chicken.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. This is my first review I've left, signed up because I've NEVER had such a horrible experience. Visiting my family on vacation, we as a party of 7 went out here for all you can eat sushi. Keep in mind, I worked as a server, my two siblings with me both worked as servers. I'm a regular 20%+ tipper. We were the first ones in for the dinner session. We sat down and waited 1 hour and 45 min for our food and only got 30% of it. Finally I grab the manager, and explain how the the other 8 tables thst sat after us have all been served and some even finished and paid, before we got our food. He was rude and unnaccomadating. Very disappointed. Will not return under current management."}
{"text":"Love the Elliot roll, and the Super California. Both are must tries if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have never been disappointed!  The sushi is fresh and the price is right!"}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful variety for a great price!  The service is always awesome and very personable.  I live in Ahwatukee and I go out of my way to have sushi here"}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona from Los Angeles.  I probably ate sushi once a week in L.A.  I always look at yelp for places to go. Boy was I lucky I came across this place. Back in L.A. most of the sushi restaurant are owned by Japanese or korean. This one is owned by Chinese. I have never been to a Chinese owned sushi restaurant.   I'm lucky I did. Not only do they have ayce sushi, they also have some Chinese dishes on the ayce menu. The sushi here is amazing!!!  For $20 ayce you can't beat it. Of course you dont have to get ayce. They have a full chinese menu and sushi that's not on the ayce.  If your looking for sushi and you dont know where to go, try this place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi restaurants in Arizona. Very reasonable prices. Sushi deluxe, rainbow roll and spicy tuna rolls are our faves. Chow Mein noodles are decent. A bit shady on the meat inside but still good for the price. They are sometimes busy and can be unorganized but overall a good spot for sushi. They have all you can eat also, that's the next thing to try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good atmosphere. Very friendly and helpful staff. Totally handicap accessible. And you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"The food is great I had Cali rolls and NY rolls both were better than what I'm used to. My wife had the red boy and I think we both found a new fav. The service is outstanding even with a packed house. Linda our server was very friendly and fast to refill drinks as needed. She even refilled our drinks after we paid the bill which is very strange since I've never seen that anywhere before, so refreshing. Prices are really good for sushi standards, out bill was $36 for 5 rolls and 2 sake bombers. This is definitely going to be my new spot for sushi."}
{"text":"Please PLEASE do NOT eat here...

A friend and I went here saturday night and had the all you can eat sushi
The sushi looks good on the plate and in pictures but once you put it in your mouth it is mussy and WARM!

We did the all you can eat sushi

The lettuce wraps are lacking flavor and greasy.
The crap wonton are hard and taste stale.
The calamari is OK. Still not very good and was not hot.
The miso soup taste like a can make it from a powder packet from the store.
We had 1 rainbow roll ( mussy and warm )
1 salmon and avocado ( Mussy and warm I also spit out a seed of some kind while eating a piece of this one )
And 1 crunch roll which was just disgusting and I only ate 1 piece .

This is an honest review and I really dont understand why they were so busy when we were there. 

Their sushi and apps that we had were horrible and made us feel very sick after we were done. Very much NOT worth the 60$$ we spent

We will never go back and will stick to our normal sushi place ( Sushi Go Round )
Where the prices are cheap and the sushi is GOOD AND COLD.

Thank you."}
{"text":"Great little hidden treasure!  Great food!  Great service! Great prices!  The best Chicken Fried Rice!  Great staff!  Kyle is especially nice!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi! I've been looking for a local place and have found one I can look forward to returning to. The lunch specials are amazing and such a great price. You get soup and salad with your rolls."}
{"text":"When someone first told me about Orient Grill, I was a little apprehensive. In my experience, \"all you can eat sushi\" means \"bland, low quality sushi.\" While this wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, it was still damn good. And for $20 a pop, you can't beat it. I expected a small AYCE menu but it was actually rather large, with everything from more traditional sushi, to the more Americanized rolls. Even better, the \"buy one beer, get another for a penny\" deal. And it was GOOD beer too! I expected Coors or Bud Light for that price. Nope, I had two big bottles of Kirin. Also, friendly service and not too crowded for a Friday night. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good sushi place and we finally found one!!! The dynamite roll is the best!! They have a full bar too! Also tried Norway and Philadelphia roll. All you can eat $23.95 or All you can eat Sashimi for $29.95! You gotta check it out! Service was great too very attentive but not overly so. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The quality of sushi combined with the decent prices makes this my favorite place every time I am in the valley."}
{"text":"This is our favorite date night location!  Delicious food, good service, great prices!  Always busy so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"A Gilbert Gem! Great food, great people and service. The owner is always around and eager to make sure things are the way you want it."}
{"text":"Wow!! There is only one place I like sushi but I thought I would give this place a try since it is so close to my house. I am so glad I did because this place is amazing!! Great service and delicious food! My new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The server (Helen) and owners were very friendly.  Went with 5 other husky males who are veterans of ayce sushi.  We ordered about 20 rolls and 30 rolls of sashimi thinking the sushi chefs would take a while to send out the food.  Little did we know that the sushi chefs were veterans themselves and accepted the challenge.  Within a half an hour the plates kept coming with more and more food.  Just when we thought we had our food, more rolls came out.   Halfway through the dinner we started to slow down.  Luckily one of our teammates gave us a peptalk and reminded us of our skills and reminded us of where we come from.  We continued to put down the sushi until we were victorious.  With a nod of acomplishment from the chefs, we left the restaurant as winners with our heads held high and our bellys extended.  We would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes ayce sushi for $25 per person."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was pleasantly surprised. Finding good sushi in the East Valley is such a challenge, but this place is great! I recommend the Gilbert Roll if you like cream cheese; it has that plus tempura fried sweet potato inside and eel on top. Also, the seaweed salad is worth ordering, which has the refreshing addition of cucumber in it. If you like spicy tuna, try the Crunch Roll! The service is good and the prices are really reasonable considering the satisfactory portion size. Overall, I'd say go here to get your sushi fix!

Update: I went back a few days after my first review to try the lunch menu. For less than $7, you can get a really great meal. It comes with soup and is in a bento box, which has compartments of rice, the main option, salad, and a few pieces of fruit. It was so much food that I took home home leftovers. This is just another reason why this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times in the past few years but I will not be going back after tonight. The food was not bad, it never has been. However, the service was beyond horrible. We got a total of 9 rolls and it took over an hour to get one roll (they were not packed). Next the waiter returned with a refilled drink that after drinking out of my father figured out wasn't his, it was the women's next to us that she had already drank out of. It took 30 minutes to get the bill when we asked for it. When we went to talk to management about our server he interrupted us to take a call and told us to wait. Needless to say we had had enough at that point and left."}
{"text":"Sushi was too warm. Squid sashimi has mucoid feeling as I bite into it. It was ok AYCE. The service was ok since I had  to ask to refill water. Typical sushi place with nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. And I love the sushi here. We go as a group and go to be able to eat and catch up. A couple of times we have been asked to leave because we have  stayed too long and there is a wait. I guess that is OK. Strange... but the sushi is so good so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi I've had in the valley yet. Great prices and the sushi excellent. Quick and friendly service. I would eat here everyday"}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite spots for years! Always fresh and always good. The service is fasy and friendly whether you dine in, pick up or order delivery.

The kids order a california roll. Hubby lives the norway roll...spicy salmon roll with fresh avocado and salmon on top. I am partial to the salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri.

Not a sushi fan? Don't worry, they also have awesome hot dishes. Try the mongollian beef, kung pao chicken, chow mein noodles or a hot noodle soup. You wont be disappointed with any option."}
{"text":"We've eaten in restaurant and ordered take out twice.

$19.95 All you can eat sushi (which includes entrees & appetizers!) is awesome. I loved the section on the menu. The Gilbert Roll is my favorite.

Not into sushi? I'm not a huge fan of the raw stuff either. The entrees are delicious. I've had the Chicken Katsu & the Honey Chicken. The honey chicken is ah-mazing! Just enough sweetness. I'm not sure how the entree dinners are served in the restaurant BUT with take-out the portion is huge!  I really think I could have shared with 2 other people. With that the prices are great.

We also had sushi delivered (which we were nervous about aft first) which arrived neat and ready to eat - there was even a bag of ice to keep it all chilled.

Overall, great experience here!"}
{"text":"Fish was okay. There were a lot of rice and not enough protein. Options for AYCE is very limited. Drive another 40 minutes to Akitas Sushi; it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"good sushi at a good price. I love the fact that they deliver. I have eaten there a few times and the atmosphere was great. I do delivery a lot just because it's easier."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch and a couple for dinner, over the past few years, and I have always been very happy. I am not an expert in sushi rolls but have tried sushi rolls in other places and have always felt this place is better than  most places I have been to. There lunch combos are also very good. The prices are very reasonable as well. I really feel like I get great value for my money when I come here. Service has always been great too."}
{"text":"Fresh, inexpensive! Friendly. Quick! Did I say Fresh? I have been coming her for over 5 years. You won't be disappointed if you are a true sushi lover."}
{"text":"This spot is always good. Food is always delicious. They even have a $24.99 all you can eat sushi which I've taken advantage of many times. My only gripe is the decor. I'm huge on ambience and it's just sub par. If you don't care about that and just want delicious sushi, here's your spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I have become regulars here. Delicious food, fresh fish, and a great value for the money. 

We originally came in after a menu was left on our door. We were skeptical about placing a delivery order for sushi, but the \"all the time\" special sushi prices and all you can eat sushi options got us curious.  Now it's our go to spot, and yes, you can trust their delivery sushi. Even on 120+ days in Phoenix! Our sushi delivery always arrives on ice and cold! Unless it's a deep fried roll and those are always still warm and crunchy. 

The Chinese and Japanese cooked food is good too, especially the crab wontons and the teriyaki and orient chicken dishes."}
{"text":"Had some cashew chicken with white rice. We ordered the tempura shrimp and a California roll. It was super yummy and they were so nice while picking up the order."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo GOOD! Plus the happy hour is the best! If you go - I highly recommend the Philly roll and the Las Vegas roll. This is a place you crave afterwards and can't wait for the next time I will be eating there."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. Ordered the mongolian chicken and received beef... They fixed it extremely fast!
The sushi was amazing and fresh. Sunomo salad was very fresh and cold. The edemame were huge!
I cannot wait to come back again and try other sushi items."}
{"text":"BOMB.COM Go here NOW! You won't be disappointed. All you can eat sushi that tastes fresh and delicious! YOU MUST try the avocado salad.  We tried 8 rolls and then tapped out.  The calamari was sooooo good.  We tried the spring rolls-good too! Least favorite rolls were the oriental roll and las vegas roll.  But other than that everything was great. Favorite roll was the shrimp tempura roll! SOO worth it. GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! Some of the best and cheapest sushi we've found thus far in the surrounding area.  We got some of the \"under 30 minute meals\", which were served on cute plates, with soup and salad. 

Sushi was cheap and tasty (California rolls and some sort of shrimp roll) and salad dressing was tangy and citrusy. Portions were plentiful and we took leftovers home. 

We'll definitely be going back to check out the super hot noodle bowls and penny beer."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh Sushi  Plus you cant beat their prices! The staff is friendly and service is fast. So bomb! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever!  They have the all you can eat sushi and they don't skimp on the fish or the options that you can choose from on the all you can eat deal.  They even have entrees and appetizers to choose from.  The sushi chefs have great attitudes and are a lot of fun to interact with as well.  Will not go anywhere else for sushi anymore.  Their other entrees are yummy as well especially the honey chicken.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better prices. Go to place for sushi. Service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I've came here on a whim.  I got the restaurant's pamphlet in the mail, skimmed through the selections and decided to there to try it out considering it was only a few blocks away from home.   

The food is absolutely delicious.  My fiancee and I went with the All you can eat Sushi  (19.95 per person) which has a large selection of food to choose from. The all you can eat menu also included non sushi items like miso, edamame, tempura, some entree items, rolls and many more.     

My Fiancee and I stuck with the Maguro, Octopus, Tuna Roll, Mixed Tempura, Miso, Red Snapper, Super California Roll.  All were great but the super California roll was a bit sweet for my liking, but my fiancee loved it.   The portions and ratio of rice to fish slice was great, they weren't holding back in cutting. :) 

Our server was great, he was helpful when we had questions regarding the all you can eat menu, he checked on us and promptly refilled our drinks and came back to fill our other orders.  He never had us asking, \"where's our waiter\".   Too bad I can't recall his name, but he was one of the best waiters I've had at any dining establishment.  

For the amount we paid for, I punched the numbers and it came out to over 120 dollars, and we only paid 2x19.95.  


I definitely appreciate the quality of the food, service and price.   I'll be going again, once I've done digesting ALL the food I've eaten.  If you go expecting to order from the all you can eat menu, make sure you're wearing your stretchy pants!"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi in town but a great value during happy hour. I've been here several times and the service has always been good, I'm giving 3 stars because of the competition."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. The Rainbow roll is delicious!  Just be prepared to be there awhile,  because the service is not that great. Every time I've eaten here the food comes out late. We ordered spring rolls & gyochi (also delish) as appetizers. They brought out the gyochi which comes with a special house dipping sauce,  but not the spring rolls. We used our dipping trays for that sauce,  Then when our sushi was brought out, the waitress didn't bring clean ones for us to use for soy sauce & wasabi. We waited for her to come back, not able to start digging in...but she never did.  I stopped another waitress & asked her to bring two clean ones,  she brought one.  After completely done with our sushi,  They finally brought the spring rolls we'd ordered as an appetizer. We would have ordered dessert,  but dreaded the wait once again.  Great sushi, rolls are pretty big,  but not the fastest service if you don't have a lot of time."}
{"text":"Hello? 

Yeah sure, I'd love to go for all you can eat sushi for $20...but I'm sure it's all rice.

What, it's not? Well then you probably can only pick from 3 types of rolls...

What??!! There is a whole bunch of rolls to pick from and they're tasty as hell? 

And WHAT? That $20/per person also includes a large selection of appetizers and entrees? I'm freakin' in

No, it was not the best sushi I've ever had, but I've been to Japan. For $20 you can't complain at all. And try the crab puffs...there's actually more crab than cream cheese...holy shiznit!

And to top the evening off, you can buy one beer at regular price ($3.75 for Tsing Tao) and get the second for a penny.

My hubby and I are now fans. Thank you Orient Sushi & Grill!"}
{"text":"OK- went for all you can eat sushi.  Now, my expectations were low, but I was surprised anyway.  The portions sucked first off.  The fish quality was ok, but TWICE I had a little roach crawl away from the plate after they put it on the table.
Roaches and sushi restaurants do not mix, I will not be returning.  Sometimes cheap is just cheap, you know?  Maybe when you want tons of food for cheap, sushi isn't the best idea."}
{"text":"Go here.  Service is tops, the sushi is great and the place is ALWAYS hopping.  Friday and Saturday nights they serve penny beers.  Super fun and they make an effort to remember you.  This is the place you bring friends and eat good sushi!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night around 7PM and the entire place was packed and with a 20 minute wait. We asked to sit at the sushi bar and got seated right away.

We ordered some salmon sashimi, the Gilbert roll, the spider roll and a chicken Thai curry. The salmon sashimi and rolls were a solid good. The chicken Thai curry was average. The chicken slices tasted like soggy fish and I felt like it was either overcooked or old. We were hesitant to take any of it home. I recommend coming here only for the sushi or sashimi."}
{"text":"This place is very good and their lunch specials are such a good price! Also my kids love their kids meals of sweet and sour chicken!!"}
{"text":"1st try at this place and we ordered for delivery ($20 minimum  purchase).  We ordered hamachi kama, California roll, spider roll and new York roll for 2 of us.  Everything taste good, the hamachi kama has a lot of meat in it which is great.  The food arrives about 30 minutes after ordered, it takes credit cards over the phone and sign after they arrive.  They charged  $2 for delivery fees (which I didn't know and I didn't check the recipt after they arrive and they didn't tell me),   and I tip them additions for delivery...(which is a mistake afterall).  Anyways, good food good service and good at the prices.  I like it has delivery service.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I've never had sushi where the fish was cooked before putting it in the roll. That was a first. We ordered a roll with salmon and took one bite, and spit it out. The spicy beef dish we got was your typical $7.99 all you can chinese on every corner quality meat, rubbery and really couldn't be distinguished between any other meat. The hot n sour soup was excellent I will admit. The service was poor and thats being nice. The waitress was polite and we got our drinks right away but we didn't see her again until our check came 40 minutes later. So we had that awkward we need a refill and the check right away because we're on our lunch break and please hurry. Prices are terrific though! You won't find cheaper food, quality of service, or cooking methods anywhere!"}
{"text":"After trying literally EVERY all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in greater Phoenix, my oldest daughter (my sushi buddy since my wife won't touch any salt-water creature with a 10-foot pole) and I had basically given up on finding a local restaurant with a sushi selection worth the $20+ price.  I am so glad we found Orient Sushi & Grill.  Not only are the sushi options extensive on the AYCE menu, but a wide selection of appetizers AND ENTREES is also included!  We were able to even get Orange Chicken as part of the AYCE sushi menu.  This is more-than-worth the $23.95 price, and for us, the 1-hour drive."}
{"text":"After living in the neighborhood for a couple years, this has become my wife & I'd favorite standby restaurant when we don't feel like eating at home. Even friends from Phoenix and Scottsdale look forward to visiting us East-Valleyers just to go to our \"neighborhood sushi place.\" I've had better sushi in my life but Orient is reliable, convenient & good. Heck, I'm a regular! 

PS: all you can eat sushi is now $25 I think. Still not bad. And permanent happy hour?? No complaints."}
{"text":"Last night was an amazing dining experience I've had in a while. I am very particular when it comes to sushi. I went there with a few of my friends and we had All You Can Eat Sushi. The quality of the fish is fresh and at perfect temperature.  The Sashimi was amazingly delicious, so tender.  The man tended to us frequently even though they were swamped. He makes us feel important and welcomed.  The customer service was professional like a five star hotel.  I never saw the place so packed, full house.  I had such an enjoyable night that I had to write this review! I am satisfied and will definitely be returning this weekend with my family."}
{"text":"I love this place but will say that I can't stand it when the owner/manager is our server.  She is very rude.  If she's a manager she needs to be fired, and if she's the owner she needs to take a back seat and pay someone else to do her job.  This is the ONLY thing giving this restaurant a 3 star rating because it ruins the experience when she is our server.  If it wasn't for her, we would easily give this place a 5 star rating.

My husband and I have a hard time finding a sushi place we like, and come here 2-4 times per month.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is tasty.  I don't recommend the all-you-can-eat because the amount of sushi you would need to get to make it cost efficient could feed a small village.  The rest of the servers here and the sushi chefs are very friendly and good at their job.  The servers even recognize my husband and myself and will come chat with us for a bit when we first arrive before asking if we'd like to start out with our usual drinks and soup.  Even when the place is packed our drinks get refilled quickly and our food comes out quick.  Occassionally the food will come out in a weird order or not all at once, but that is pretty rare and doesn't bother us."}
{"text":"Orient Sushi never disappoints. Their all you can eat Sushi and Sashimi platters keep me coming back all the time. It's totally priced right and the fish is so fresh and plump. The service has always been great and helpful when we've had questions or needed anything at all. I drive almost 30 minutes to eat at Orient Sushi, but it's always worth it to me."}
{"text":"I could eat sushi for every meal, but my husband can't stand it.  This place is the best of both worlds for us!  The selection of the sushi and other dishes is great, the service is friendly, the quality is excellent, and the price is just right (1/2 price sushi).  My husband ordered the cashew chicken w/fried rice last night (it was so delicious).  For the price, the portion size was big and we had plenty of leftovers to take home.  As others have mentioned, this place is a hidden gem and we're so glad to have found it after recently moving to Mesa."}
{"text":"Prior to today, I've never had a bad experience at this place. That ended today. You can't have wait staff that don't speak English and expect the orders to be right.  My food was wrong despite the guy next to me saying I'll have the same thing and his food being right! What the heck? Further, the waiter didn't know what ingredients were in each dish. And then we waited 20 minutes to get the bill after we were done eating. Usually I tip at least a pittance no matter how bad the service is. today was an exception to that rule. I will be looking for another cheap Chinese place before I head back.

One more thing, major health department violation. If you take the glasses off the table and into the kitchen to refill them then you have to bring back fresh new glasses. That is the law we have no guarantee that when the ice T came back we got our original glasses back but it was clear they were not new glasses."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Sushi/Asian restaurant. The restaurant is clean and visually appealing, the portions are large, the prices are affordable and there is a ton of selection. (They also deliver within a certain radius!)

I tend to be the type of person that is hesitant to branch out and try all the items on the menu, But here, I haven't been disappointed yet.

Their Chicken Pad Thai and their RedBoy roll are my favorite go-to items as far as taste and price. But don't be shy about substituting or adding something to your meal or Roll. They are open to special orders are tend to only charge 50 cents to a dollar extra. (We added cream cheese to our cucumber roll)."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Great prices, we got 5 really good rolls for around $40. Really impressed, and when we asked for a special roll of the chefs choosing, we got the coolest dragon roll (see photos for a picture!) really nice place, will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I found this little gem 4 years ago, since then I have yet to go to any other sushi restaurant. The quality of fish is excellent, the staff are friendly, and the sushi... oh the sushi. The Phoenix roll is my favorite thing on the menu. Their spicy tuna mix in unlike any other sushi restaurants. You can actually see the chunks of ahi mixed in with the ground ahi and spices. It's so good! I will drive out of my way from Tempe to get sushi from this place. Bonus: they have permanent happy hour!! Good quality fish at a decent price is more than I could ever ask for! My friends and I all agree, best sushi in Arizona"}
{"text":"Place is spot on. My wife and I get to go dinners every few weeks. Always very friendly and the order is always ready to go with no wait. I can see they care and I'm happy they are in my community. Keep it going guys..."}
{"text":"I ususally have a \"go to\" sushi place I go for dinner/ lunch ...have gone for years to that same location but, lately they have been closing early without prior notice and it is really disappointing to show up hungry and a sign there saying \"sorry, we are closing early\" or coming in and having the staff (ladies) have a smug look in their face telling you that. The customer service has also declined drastically. (My sister and her husband feel the same way about the customer service and have stopped going there as well)... I love sushi and am very picky about it being fresh and the quality of it... I was sadden that I was going to have to look for a different location for sushi... A coworker of mine recommended this \"Orient Sushi Grill\", she knows how picky I am about fresh sushi and customer service.... I have been there at least 7 times in the last two months and OMG! I loved it! The sushi is Fresh, the quality is on point and the customer service has been Amazing every time I've gone... this little \"whole on the may\" may not be as popular as other sushi bars but, it's one of those places you tell your friends about!
Absolutely impressed! I have found my new sushi place."}
{"text":"Our  male waiter had  bad customer service. Great food tho.  He looked like he was having a bad day"}
{"text":"Love love love sushi!! Orient Sushi and Grill is a small cute restaurant located in Gilbert. It is not a fancy place but it's great for a casual meal with friends, family or your special cuddle buddy . I ate here twice; once during the week at a time when the place was not too busy and the second time on a Saturday night for dinner when the restaurant was full. The service was good and fast, both times. Our waiter was friendly and our sushi rolls were delicious. I attached photos of the menu to show the prices for the meals they offer."}
{"text":"Really good food at a great price! The salad dressing is something to be admired, the sushi is always fresh and affordable. Try the curry chicken!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for all you can eat. Little bit of a hole in the wall place. Pretty fast food service. They need to learn how to slice jalape√±o. Other than that a solid three star joint."}
{"text":"Great specials and really good sushi. Very unassuming from the outside but always busy. Quickly becoming our go to place."}
{"text":"Did come back as I promised!  This time earlier in the day, and after doing the math, the wifey and I figured it was worth doing the AYCE.  They do have some rules: no taking home leftovers from AYCE, and you aren't supposed to share with other member you are with if they aren't also doing AYCE.  Well, it was a good thing we both did it, because my wife ordered too much and I had to help her eat some!  

I started off with the shumai (shrimp dumplings)...very good with the dipping sauce.  I also had veggie spring rolls.  The filling was good, but outside was a bit oily.  

All the other rolls were good. I found something interesting in the sushi pieces: the rice actually had a touch of wasabi on it, the way it's supposed to be done, but few places actually do it.  Listen to the waitresses' advice: order just a few pieces at a time (or rolls), otherwise, it is easy to order too much and then not be able to finish it all.  Note that, when you aren't that hungry, the regular \"half price\" menu is usually the better deal."}
{"text":"Always made fresh and the tastes always good. Pricing is decent and they do have an all you can eat option. I enjoy their calamari appetizer as well. It's a small restaurant but the quality and freshness is there."}
{"text":"This has been my #1 sushi place for a long time. I always order the New York roll along with others. However the last several times I ordered they changed the salmon. When I've mentioned it they deny it but it is not even the same as the fresh salmon they have pictured. They treat me as if I'm crazy. I'm not one to usually complain so therefore I'll just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I didn't try the sushi. I didn't need to.

The wife and I actually came here because they were advertising 1 cent bottles of beer. Goes to show you our priorities... Anyway we walk into this fine establishment to find the penny beers waiting for us. Typical Bud Light/Miller Light, but who cares! They're a penny!

They ambience is great. Low light, quiant booths with a bar on one side. When I use the word quaint, I don't mean small. Yes, it IS small, but it is a very pleasant small.

Well, I've been on a quest to find all the yummy ramens of the valley.  Lo and behold, whats on their menu? You got it! Ramen.  Chicken or Beef or Seafood or Spicy Bonzai, you can't go wrong.  I got the beef with the Udon noodles and I SWEAR to you... they brought out a GALLON of soup. A GALLON! There wasn't much to it, but it was tasty.  Noodles, sprouts, seasoned broth, and beef.  We also ordered a plate of the Honey Chicken and it DIDN'T disappoint.  It was twice the size of PeiWei's similar dish, and MUCH tastier.  With it, came a dish of white rice.

This place was right under my nose.  I will definitely be back! I want to try the spicy Bonzai ramen.  They say if you can eat 2 bowls, its free! That would be... 2 Gallons of soup."}
{"text":"let me preface this with the fact that I have been a loyal customer for almost 6 years... until now

I had a party of 12 arrive at 6pm and the restaurant was fairly empty. 

it took over 5 minutes for a server to greet us and another almost 5 minutes to receive our water.

There were no napkins, plates, or soy sauce dishes on the table. When another member of my party got up and asked the manager for some plates and napkins (due to the server not being around), she told him \"yes yes yes we will get it, now go sit down\"

I don't think anything needs to be said about the rudeness of that above quote.

Myself and a buddy both got the all you can eat. After ordering the sushi,  it took approximately 35 minutes to get the first round. The server took the paper for us to write our next round down and it took almost 20 minutes to track down the paper. 

While trying to write the second order down,  the manager came over in a hurry and demanded to see our paper after telling us we had a rainbow roll (we told her we didn't order that). She continued to demand our paper until we handed it to her. She then hurried away.  We handed the paper to the server with our second order and approximately 45 minutes after that, myself and my buddy had to ask what the status was. The server said he would check on it.

Approximately 20 minutes after that, another manager brought out my buddies two rolls and none of mine. The server asked us if everything was good. I informed him that I was missing my sushi rolls and gyoza and my buddies calamari. 

They brought all of the checks out at this time (weird since I didn't even have all of my food yet, same for my buddy)

The server stated \"it will be a very long time for the gyoza\". I was shocked and asked why. He stated that the orders were very backed up. I told him forget it.

We finished our food and I wrote on the check that it was the worst service I've had in 6 years...

it's a shame because it used to be the best place to go. now the prices are hiked up and the service is way below par. 

do yourself a favor and find another place.

hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"Very good! I had the Sun Devil Chicken, Wendy had the spicy glass noodles soup, and we shared the Hamachi fish - and of course Meiya had the avacado roll and miso soup.
Very reasonably priced for the quality, and the service was attentive and friendly.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is our neighborhood sushi place so we go there/order take out quite often. It's consistently good, pretty good prices on sushi, the rolls are all decent. My son is a big fan of their orange chicken and I am too, I must say. It's not overly spicy and just the right amount of batter and crunch. Some places put so much batter on chicken that you can't even taste the chicken. I'm also a HUGE fan of their walnut shrimp! I've tried it at several different restaurants and Orient's is one of the best. Plenty of sauce, big shrimp, and just overall delicious. 

The reason I can't give them 5 stars is that they do not know how to serve wine for some reason. I've ordered white wine on several occasions there and it was brought to my table room temperature. Not good. But really have nothing bad to say about the food."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I usually only go during happy hour since i like to go on a regular basis at least once a week. A friend of mine told me about Oriental sushi and since it was in the middle of gilbert i didnt think it would be that great, I checked it out and it was honestly the one of the best sushi places  i had ever been to! Places like RA or Kona grill are good but this place gives you such a variety of choices and its all you can eat for only 19.95. you also can get as many entrees as you want with your sushi. I love this place not only for the great food but also for the great staff! I know each waiter and waitress and sushi cooks personally now and it really feels good when they greet me by name when i come thru the door. My favorite Sushi cook is Allen he really hooks it up with the best and most creative sushi dishes, If your looking for great sushi, food or just a good time check this place out"}
{"text":"Exceptional value.   Nice to see many specialty rolls on the AYCE menu.   Soup is not listed but they were happy to offer either miso or hot and sour.  Pleased at the variety of options on the appetizer menu allowing us to sample many different things.   Sushi was pretty solid for a place cranking the rolls out.  Rice could use slightly more vinegar.  Nice clean place to visit and worth a try."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and both times have been during my lunch break.  They have great friendly and fast service.  I love their Chirashi bowl.  It's the cheapest and freshest slices of fish you can find in Arizona.  
I definitely want to try this place out for dinner on a busy night to see how the ambiance is."}
{"text":"One of the best in town. Best AYCE value around and the Sushi is good, but you should also try other dishes on the menu. The combination fried rice is excellent."}
{"text":"great sushi at great prices! my go to place for sushi rolls .. pretty packed during the weekends but the service is still great. favorite item on the menu is the baked mussels they're amazing! i order them every time! and just recently tried the spicy ramen noodle soup also delicious and a good serving amount ."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for sushi due to the reasonably good sushi and prices.  But at the risk of spoiling it for myself, I will add an additional star for my meal on Friday.  I went by myself for a quick lunch (yes lunch) but decided on having the AYCE sushi and a couple of beers (due to the 1 cent offering).  But on this day they also had blue fin toro on the AYCE menu for a mere $2 more!!  Yes, just $2 more, even if you ate 20 order of toro.  I still wanted variety so I \"only ate\" 4 orders or toro, and 6 order of various other nigiri choices.  Boy, what a deal!!!  Hope to luck out one day and get toro again the next time I go back."}
{"text":"I love this place for sushi on a budget and great service! Plus it's the only place I know in the Chandler area that delivers sushi so even on the laziest of days it can't be beat. They have a half off sushi menu or the \"all you can eat\" menu (which is my favorite) that is chock full of all sorts of choices. Some nights they even do \"buy one get one for a penny\" beers. So if you have a hankering for some sushi and want to keep it local and on a budget, this place can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem!!! Hard to notice when just driving by, doesn't pop up when looking up all you can eat sushi. I was brought by some friends who told me that they served all you can eat sashimi. My reaction was like \"probably serve a limited,small amount of sashimi for a ridiculous price\" but low and behold this place is awesome!!! Yes, for sashimi and sushi all you can eat is $30 bucks but well worth it! Portions are big and generous, service was good and quality rocked!!! Will be back many, many times!"}
{"text":"YES!, all you can eat sushi, appetizers and entrees, all brought right to your table! It's like the ultimate lazy-mans buffet. They give you an order form and you can keep ordering and ordering..."}
{"text":"The BEST kept secret in Gilbert! Love this place. Delivery is fast and sashimi is so fresh! Highly recommended by me :)"}
{"text":"This is our go to local sushi joint and we have been several times. I love that they deliver sushi!!! Their portions are very generous and reasonable pricing. This place is great, fast, and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the prices are so cheap! They have all of the deluxe rolls. Everything is fresh and they really care about the service! The vegetable tempura is nice too."}
{"text":"Wow.  I read the reviews and wanted to try a good all you can eat AYCE sushi place while in town and picked Orient Sushi & Grill.  I ate at another sushi restaurant yesterday and was quite disappointed.  

The restaurant interior is nice, not overly fancy.  Nice and clean.  I sat by the front windows which I didn't love since the sun was shining on my table.  It was winter and during the summer this wouldn't be an issue because of the location of the sun.

The first thing I noticed about their menu is it is not just sushi.  They had classic Chinese American dishes as well.  The AYCE menu had not only sushi, but some appetizers and some of the non-sushi dishes.

I started the meal off with some fried squid and crab wontons.  The squid I didn't much care for, but the crab wontons were awesome.  I could have just order the wontons for my entire meal.

I tried 4 different rolls.  They were huge!  Usually I expect smaller rolls with lots of rice, but that was not the case here.  They had just the right amount of rice and tons of filling and toppers.  One of the rolls was called the Dynamite Scallop roll.  It was a California fill with baked scallops on top.  These weren't little tiny scallops either.  They were dollar coin size scallop pieces.  It was great.

The service was wondeful.  They refilled my drinks and check on me often.  If I was to offer any type.of critcism it would be about their eel sauce.  It was not quite as sweet as I like it. 

Overall a great AYCE sushi.  Too bad I'm not a local."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and delicious. Good service. Comfortable seating. I am their newest loyal customer."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I've had their chicken katsu bento box (thin fried chicken, small salad, rice in a square lunch... food holder), sushi rolls, and udon noodles. The prices are GREAT. They have a good selection of asian foods to choose from to feed your asian fix at a great price. The people are very friendly and nice. DO IT."}
{"text":"I go here all the time!! I love love love their spicy scallop sushi and it's just so good every time I go. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews Me and the Wife decided to try this place and we are sure glad we did the all you can eat sushi for 19.95 per person is well worth it. From the tuna rolls to the dynamite roll that I had it was awesome. Great atmosphere. The waitress was very attentive. and the staff was very knowledgable and  just a great place to eat and enjoy a night out. I highly recommend this place and will be back with our friends."}
{"text":"As Orient lured me back into its good graces for a 4 star review on 2/18/16, Sunday night we ordered take out. 3/6. About 2 weeks from our last visit.

And let me say I wouldn't have wrote THIS review if it wasn't for the poor response we got from the owner. i would of chalked it up as a bad experience.....but he pushed my buttons.

As I ate my beef and vegetables, the texture wasn't great. Very slimy as I tried to chew and I knew after the 3rd bite to stop. I continued to pick and eat the veggies. 
I also ordered some chicken lettuce wraps as a back up because I was starving. I doctored up 2 on my plate and shoved the entire first one in my mouth.....hmmmmmmm funky.  Unusual crunchiness and a pungent after taste like a strong cheese was in it........as I take a bite of my 2nd one......again.......funky.  I'm done with my meal.
I'll pass on the details to follow that night.

We simply called the next day to tell the establishment that it was NOT good, we became very nauseous and we would like our dinner money back.
\"NO ONE ELSE SICK\"
\"THIS IS WHY WE HAVE INSURANCE\"
\"GO TO DOCTOR AND TURN INTO OUR INSURANCE\"
\"NOTHING I CAN DO\"
\"NO REFUNDS!!!    NOT EVER!!\"\"

My wife and son are more lunch time regulars than I am, and she always gets a BIG welcome every time she's in there with him. With dozens of Asian restaurants in the Gilbert area we will simply take Orient off our list.
ATTENTION OWNERS.......this is where a kind....\"I'm sorry your meal wasn't good last night\" would of spoke volumes to us a valued customer. Even if thats all we got and you STILL refused our refund, a simple \"Sorry\" would of kept 2 regular lunch customers coming back. 

I'm Sorry for my one star review."}
{"text":"Always amazing and super affordable, just moved here from California and had a hard time find good quality sushi in Az, so happy I found this place"}
{"text":"My sister and I frequent Orient Sushi on the regular! They have great prices and friendly service. I really enjoy how their menu describes every roll unlike some restaurants that keep you guessing! They have happy hour pricing all day long and even offer an all you can eat sushi menu. Personally, I've never had it but if you can eat I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just went here and the food and service was excellent! The quality of food for all-you-can-eat sushi was top notch. Our server was constantly checking on us and making sure our drinks were topped off.

They had many sushi rolls to choose from and for excellent prices. I plan to make this my go-to sushi establishment."}
{"text":"I love trying new sushi places but it's always hit or miss on whether or not the sushi is fishy. I always know that when I order from here it will be excellent. This is my go to when I want yummy sushi and I am not in the mood to take a chance on it not meeting my expectations."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because they have half-price sushi for take out orders and my normal sushi place doesn't do half price for take out. 

The sushi is good. Kind of small but good. I really don't like that they put smoked salmon in most of their rolls instead of just regular salmon but hey what can I do?

Every time I've waited for my take out order I can hear people being loud and drunk. Take that as you will. Some people like the loud drunk fun atmosphere but other people like quiet. Probably not a good place to bring a first date or family even if it does look really classy.

I hear they have some good deals that involve one cent beer night and all you can eat sushi. That's pretty sweet."}
{"text":"The service could have been a bit better. Aside from that, I really appreciated the portions for the seaweed salad as well as the cool combo options offered. I'll consider going back for the combo if i'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's favorite place to go to for sushi.  It may not be as \"creative\" as Stingray, but you can get the staples and specialty rolls.  They offer all-you-can-eat sushi, but we've found that ordering off the menu is less expensive because all sushi is HALF PRICE!  Yes, it can be busy, but they do their best to get rolls to you fairly quickly.  Don't be turned off if the parking lot appears full -- B Dubs is next door so chances are people are grabbing wings and a drink while watching the big game."}
{"text":"After looking specifically for an AYCE sushi place near by, I came across reviews for this one. The sushi was very fresh and the AYCE menu was not skimpy and included a fair amount of special rolls and plenty of sides and entrees. The staff was very friendly and attentive, although it was pretty slow while I was there but got busy just before I left. I highly recommend this place, especially if your looking for a place with normal hours and great sushi and really want AYCE for 19.95.

Update: I have returned about a year later to enjoy this place once again but was a bit displeased this time around. The sushi was warm and not nearly as flavorful as the first time around and the salmon was tough (yes, the salmon) and I could not bite clean through it. I would have given this place a three for this visit so I have split the difference and downgraded them to a four. Hopefully next time will be better. I'll give it one more chance with the hope that this was a unique bad experience."}
{"text":"We did a huge party of 20 ppl and they got all of our orders out super quick and perfectly done. The staff was so friendly and helpful we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"OMG SOOO GOOD.... A penny for a 12oz beer with the all you can eat dinner sushi. By far hands down best!!! Serving size of salad & apps are amazing!!! The rolls are great tasting and well presented 32 flavors!! Surprise is they have 1/2 orders on kitchen entree ( didn't do this time) but it is all the classic dishes (11 of them). The calamari is LIGHTLY breaded and clean tasting, the sauce to dip was amazing. 

The servers are hospitable and happy. 

We are so comming back!!!"}
{"text":"You can get AYCE sushi here and you can also order other dishes such as gyoza, seaweed salad, spring rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, hand rolls, and etc. All for just $23. 

Service is great and although it's definitely not the best sushi I've had, it's very good for the price you are paying. If you're craving sushi, check this place out. 

The owner is Chinese I believe so there are also Chinese food items on the menu. I'll have to try them next time."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi here is awesome! I've been here about half a dozen times and each time was great!

It's so rare to find a place like this, where I cannot think of anything that could be done better. The fish has always been fresh and really tasty and the service was on point each time as well.
Being able to order all you can eat sashimi alone is a huge selling point, but there are so many other options available on the all you can eat menu.
I had some of the kitchen food as well and each of those dishes were great too.
I feel like the price for the all you can eat is legit too. In Tucson I think you can get all you can eat sushi but it never includes sashimi and costs the same amount.

If I'm ever in Phoenix and can't find the time to stop here, I always feel like I missed out.
If you can put away some sushi and want some quality cuts, this place was made for you!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices, super fresh fish and some different rolls, most of them are even half price! They deliver too which is awesome when I just want to eat sushi in my jammies LOL. Friendly staff and yummy food! One of my favorite places for calamari salad...try it, it's great!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to town and was a nearly weekly visitor to an \"all you can eat\" sushi place back home.  One of my first missions in Phoenix was to find something comparable.  I set a few bookmarks on Yelp and tried this first.  I really liked this place.  Even though it was busy and prime time I walked right in and sat down at the sushi bar.  The sushi was very good and they had a high variety of rolls and fish on the all you can eat menu.  They have the standard \"pay for what you don't finish\" rule so I ordered in a way that I THOUGHT was conservative.  Please order lightly when trying the all you can eat for the first time because everything was HUGE!  I panicked when I saw the amount of food in front of me and was sure I would be paying the price literally and figuratively for the reef of food in front of me.  I managed to finish it all and limp out to my car.  I'll be back and MUCH more careful in how much food I order, as these pieces of sushi are very large."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ!! Don't you dare go anywhere else. I kind of don't really want to write a review so no one knows how good it is so the prices stay so low. This is the best sushi you'll ever have."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place anytime we're in the mood for sushi.  Come with a  good appetite and order from the all-you-can-eat menu.  I can't get over the fact that it includes a bunch of different appetizers that are just as good as the sushi!  And to the restaurant's credit, even though we order massive quantities of food and I'm sure they doubt that we can really eat that much (we can!), they have always been super polite and never tried to discourage us from ordering it or skimp on anything.  They just bring out lots and lots of incredible food.  We also request a couple small modifications like cutting the squid pieces in half so they're easier to eat, and they're very nice about doing it for us.  The only thing I wish is that they had a little more dessert available!  But to be fair, it's a sushi restaurant, not a dessert restaurant."}
{"text":"I had to come back and give five stars because they deserve it!  My only problem back in 2014 was that wait staffs were bad at taking orders.  Now that we've been eating here for over two years we got wiser.  When you sit down they will give you the menu and two paper order form.  One is for all you can eat sushi and the other one is for individual Sushi you want to order.  I just write down what I want on the individual sushi form and not even worry about it.  I know I don't have to do that since current wait staffs are AWESOME but it became my habit.  Now I take everyone there.  Lot of our friends are taking their families there for birthdays and well just simple Fridays and Saturdays for yummy lunch or dinner.  Their sushi is amazing but you have to try their spicy noodle soup.  This winter and spring is way cold for me and luckily their spicy noodle soup is helping me get through those cold weather.  Oh and I don't know if the older lady is Manager or Owner but she's super nice."}
{"text":"This place was awesome service was okay but even if before all that I spoke to a gentleman named Scott and he was probably the main reason why I even came to this place excellent customer service but our server was alright she could be a little bit more social but other than that food was good"}
{"text":"I am one of those people that travels quite often and always look for an AYCE Sushi place. I was in Phoenix area twice lately, I went to Mido Sushi in Chandler and it was quite good.

I figured I would try Orient Sushi Grill this trip. What a disappointment. I ordered several pieces of Nigiri and there so so much rice in each piece I could not even taste fish. I was so stuffed after three piece not sure I could finish. Well it was as if I ate 3 huge rolls of just rice. My guess there was a quarter cup of rice in each piece and a paper thin piece of fish.

I  would guess there was more rice in every piece than a full roll would have. I felt totally ripped off.

I have been to a few that play this trick in my encounters around the US but this one is WAY MORE than other one I have tried."}
{"text":"Very good... Low prices. Keeps me going back for more. Haven't had a problem with customer service. Greeters are always pleasant."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Passenger - Let Her Go)

Well you only eat sushi when it's freshly roll
Only miss the spice when you start the sauce
Only know you love it when you let it go

Only know you've been hungry when you're feeling low
Only hit the sake when you're missing home
Only know you love it when you let it go

At the Orient


Honestly, my first thought of this place was okay when I first walked in.  The place is a fusion of all the major Asian cuisines; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.  All you can eat sushi for $25 and Sashimi for $30.  

The place itself is a mom & pop owned place with pretty good service I thought!  

I ordered the Regular Sushi entree, while my family ordered the Pad Thai, Bonzai Noodles with Udon noodles, and some of us got the full on buffet.  Overall, my sushi came with 2 Tuna, 2 Salmon, 1 Yellow Tail, 1 Shrimp, 1 Eel, and set of California Rolls.  I'm not a sushi snob, but overall I found it fairly fresh to the bite and perfectly plated.  I also ordered a side of Tempura Vegetables, which I thought was a lot, but boy did I scarf it down; love the crunch of tempura!  I think my favorite taste of the table had to be my sisters Bonzai Noodles.  Strong spicy broth that I thought would have been great if she ordered Ramen Noodles with it.  

In the end, all you can eat sushi and sashimi is definitely a big draw for this place, but the food is surprisingly good for what I would consider an Asian fast food diner! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times over the past year or two, we LOVE this place... until a recent not-so-good experience... but today I decided to give them another chance.  Monty said he's been here about 5 times since this not-so-good time and that its been top notch, so on his word we decided to go for lunch.

Guess what... Orient and I are reunited - and it feels SO GOOD (I know I'm lame - whatever!)!  I had my favorite, Spicy Tuna roll, a Tootsie roll and at Monty's urging, I tried the albacore sashimi.  OMG sooo good, better than I remember...  fresh, delicious, and that albacore was literally LIKE BUTTA!  I mean, seriously... I think I need to excuse myself... eh hem... 

Let me just say this:  that albacore is fucking sexy!

Go here... I'm going back for the all-you-can-eat for $20 bucks!  Choose from appetizers, entrees, sushi, whatever!  2 dollar beers too.  YUM!  MUAH!"}
{"text":"Great food, for a great price. Every sushi roll we have tried has been amazing. We love the tempura and my kids love the sweet sour checking.  This is our favorite take out place :)"}
{"text":"Place has good food but service has gone downhill. Literally waited hours for food with the all you can eat sushi. Server super confused. Very disappointed in this visit probably will not visit again."}
{"text":"Service was good but the quality of food was only ok. Flavors were more on the Chinese side than Japanese. Overall a good deal if you're looking for quantity rather than authenticity."}
{"text":"Sushi sushi sushi! All you can eat sushi! Which is one of the ways they offer their sushi here, for under $21 dollars, all you can eat sashimi is a few dollars more though! I know what you're thinking, you can go to an Asian buffet and they have the same... not exactly though! Here you'll get your own rolls made of whatever you choose and they'll send it right out to your table, fresh! Not only can you choose from a large variety of sushi rolls but there's an appetizer section, soup, and entr√©es! Yes. I did say all you can eat sushi but they also allow all you can eat in other categories too, if you choose the all you can eat sushi option! Isn't that awesome!!?? These rolls and entr√©es aren't dinky either! Only catch is you have to finish most, if not all of your food before they start sending out the rest.. they don't want food wasted obviously, and I don't believe they'll give you a Togo box either, unless it's towards your last one or something. But either way it's a great deal! 

Servers there over the passed few years have gotten better, they're a tad bit more attentive now and less of a language barrier.

Recommendations: Chandler Roll, Scallop dynamite[or seafood dynamite], volcano roll, and their bonzai noodles"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I have eaten inside and have done delivery. My experience with delivery was great! My Philly roll was even served on ice to stay cold! I also ordered the honey chicken, which was recommended from many Yelp reviewers and for me it was too sweet and soggy;  I would not order again. I came back a few weeks later with a friend and ate inside. The place was not busy yet we had to wait for a table, then were seated at a small table that had rips along the seats. This isn't a deal breaker but certainly didn't leave a good first impression. Service was slow, our waiter was very quiet and hard to understand. We ordered 3 rolls (the Gilbert roll, the Vegas Roll and the Philly Roll). The Gilbert roll was outstanding!! I have never had sweet potato inside a roll but it was sooo yummy!! The rest were so-so, nothing great. I did like the fact it's always happy hour so prices were very reasonable! They also do an all you can eat, which I found out after I had already ordered, darn it! I will come back because of the prices and the fact it is so close to my house. Is it the best sushi, no. But it's A-OK!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant, I've been coming here for the last 4 almost 5 years (about once a week) The service is great and the food is second to none. If you like deep fried rolls, ask for the brother roll.
Great prices as well, most places are more expensive and do not compare to the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Amazing place and for an amazing price..I don't know what anyone is complaining about (except the roach person) this place for.  Look at the pictures, the portions are good, the sushi is fresh (AND HALF PRICE ALL DAY!), beer is a PENNY Friday and Saturday nights and AYCE not only sushi, but apps like BUTTER CALAMARI and entrees too!!  

I will be bringing my family back, and my friends for sure, in fact, I think I will be going here for my birthday next month!  Thank you for places like this, who keep great food affordable in this economy, we need all the help we can get."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and decided to break away from the normal Kona Happy Hour. That was a fantastic decision! This place is much closer and fabulous prices. My boyfriend had the dynamite seafood dish, he absolutely loved it. I just had my normal California roll and that was yummy. This will now be our normal sushi spot. 
The Gilbert roll is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The rolls are huge and priced really well. Their kids' fried rice is a really big portion and is delicious. Everyone is really nice. Our go to sushi place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I am from Las Vegas and I've had my fair share of all you can eat sushi. I came to Orient sushi with an open mind knowing that good sushi is hard to come by here in AZ. 
We ordered crab wontons, seaweed salad, miso soup (not on the ayce menu but they made an exception), yellowtail, Albacore, red snapper, tuna, phoenix roll, chandler roll, and crunch roll. The crab wontons and miso soup came out within 5 minutes of submitting our order. Then came out our Phoenix roll. Everything was good. As we were waiting for our food to come out we noticed what looked to be the owner scolding her employee in front of customers.  Then 30 minutes later our yellowtail, red snapper, and tuna came out. Upon this delivery our server informed us that the Chandler roll isn't on the AYCE menu (which we specifically asked if it was and our server said yes) we then asked where our albacore was... He said it was still being prepared. Twenty minutes later our server then came to us to let us know that Albacore is sold out for the night. Then that's when we asked for the crunch roll it came out fairly quickly it tasted like old fish.  At this point my husband was livid. We had never complained in a restaurant before until now. My husband has worked in the industry for 6 years and we understand that restaurants have bad days.  But this was unacceptable. We went to the owner of restaurant to complain and he was full of excuses.  Our server was defending us because we had waited long periods of time to receive our food and the owner scolded him right in front of us. Being an owner of a restaurant who claimed to be (and I quote) in and out of the business for 36 years should know the following things,

Your employees are reflections of the mangers/owners. Meaning if the owners aren't professional neither will your employees. 

Never use excuses. Everyone knows that there are bumps in the road. As a owner you should never give excuse as to why food/service was as terrible as it was. Just take responsibility for what it is. There is no need for excuses like \"you came in after a rush\" or \"one of our chefs got into a car accident\" 

To make a long story, not as long... At the end the owner did apologize and did compensate. But to me it just was a really bad experience overall food quality, service, and professionalism. I really wanted to like this place because as we sat there waiting for our food it did seem like regulars do come often. I don't know if I can say that I won't come back because I do believe that sometime restaurants need a second chance and the owner did seem sincere about his apology."}
{"text":"The sushi is good for the money. This is a great place if you want to get full on sushi without breaking the bank. The staff is great and the food is tasty. I also recommend the butter fried calamari as it is delicious!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for 20 bucks!  Hell yea I'm down for that!
Went with some friends for some sushi  on a Thursday night, and I have to say I don't know who lost on money here, me or the place, we all had the all you can eat and had quite a bit of sushi and rolls and normally that would have been more than 20 bucks for me.  And if you're thinking you are limited to the types of rolls or sushi you can have for the all you can eat, I can tell you safely they have so much for you to try, that you won't be able to, and if you're not into sushi or the rolls they have other dishes to have to instead on the all you can eat.
Everything we ordered was delish and perfect! I have found me a new local sushi favorite!  I for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times ,absolutely love this place. They are so fast on getting your food out to you .I never seen a sushi restaurant with such fast service and boot they are extremely nice!!"}
{"text":"I've never wanted to stop eating sushi because the fish tasted weird. I've never ever had that happen until I ate from this place. I picked up food to go and within maybe an hour after eating some of my sushi, sorry to say this but i had serious stomach issues and had to use the bathroom several times if you know what I mean. On the other hand when my boyfriend had gotten home to eat his portion in which I wish to god I would have said you know this sushi tasted off and kind of threw my stomach threw a loop I thought his stomach would be stronger. God was I wrong and I felt so miserable for the next 4 days because he was having throwing up and having diarrhea for a whole day and the diarrhea for the next few days following. 

When we get sick from places it makes me never want to step through their doors ever again. And it is severely unfortunate that the two places him and I have gotten this type of reaction is from sushi places in Arizona. I love sushi but at the same time if I have to fly back to my home town In Northern California or go to Huntington Beach i will just so we don't have stomach issues from bad sushi."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi was good quality. Waitress said we could not finish but we proved her wrong! Four stars because dining area is tiny."}
{"text":"Not exactly authentic sushi and rolls however it's tasty. With 50% off pretty much their entire menu all day, it's a steal.

I personally enjoy the Hawaii Roll and the Spider Roll (also try the soft shell crab appetizer it's great).

I wish the raw selection was a bit better (the cuts were not as good as expected), but the rolls make up for it."}
{"text":"Love the ACYE! great quality fish. They have a wide variety of rolls and appetizers. However, I didn't like that they didn't bring us food after a while even though we ordered. I felt like they were trying to get us to leave and not eat up all there food. They also have an individual order sushi thing, but it is more expensive. Good if you want quality sushi, but service here is not very good."}
{"text":"Sad day.

I came here with my girlfriend who wanted to get \"All You Can Eat\". She ordered and the sushi itself was very thin on double the amount of rice. She brought this to the attention of the waitress (she was polite) and the owner ( who was making the sushi) stated that he was not going to put less rice and it's how he makes the Nigiri. He continued the rice to sushi ratio is 70/30. The sad part is the owner not wanting to just add a little less rice for the skinny piece of sushi. It normally isn't this bad but they aren't consistent.

I attached photos to show rice to sushi ratio

Not coming back"}
{"text":"I had gotten a recommendation for my coworker to go to Orient Sushi. As we showed up the place is nothing special from the outside but very clean on the inside. Sushi was very good and came out amazingly fast though it was not very busy the time that we Whit. Service was a little spotty but it was toward the end of the night so it seemed as though they were closing down. Would recommend Orient Sushi, very good sushi, and a really good price"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall sushi but pretty good. Price is decent and they serve Chinese food as well."}
{"text":"This please is just ok. The service started off pretty slow but started to pick up after being there awhile. I'm from Southern California so the sushi there is definitely different (aka better). But for an Arizona sushi place it's alright"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the 20$ all-you-can-eat sushi/entree deal.  Fish is always good and the saki-bombers specials are well worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Has huuuuuge soup bowls. If you order a chicken noodle bowl becareful... It comes out pipeing hot and is enough for 2 or 3 people.  Really good though.

The sushi is friendly and nice.  We also have ordered the lunch specials there. Kung Pao, and the Sun Devil Chicken are pretty good quality.  They serve it in a box with salad as well as rice.

Great stop for lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great food for the price!  We had a Tempura roll, Tempura veggies, a California roll topped with Scallops and a Green salad.  All very tasty!"}
{"text":"Just tried Orient Sushi for the first time last sat. evening.
My advice:  if you enjoy sushi and eating sushi, go during the week because its a zoo on the weekends.
The bar has a bunch of seats but its in the redzone......where everyone is walking ,talking etc. , waiters grabbing food, kids running about  etc....those seats were empty during rush hour when we were there. No wonder.
I'd pass if you think you are going to have a quiet dinner with ambiance with your significant other.  It is NOT that place.

Its a sushi factory that pumps out an insane amount of food to hungry people.
Their  sushi is good...... And for 19.95 , i got 3 large rolls including a huge shrimptempura roll, 2 large pce. Yellow tail sashimi, edemame. 
My girl had the teryaki chicken with fried rice.....very good and the portions are large!
Enough for a full second dinner of leftovers.

Great value, good food but a place to simply chow down..... You'll never miss a sports moment because they have flatscreens on the walls.

If you're looking for a quiet evening......try a weekday or head elsewhere.
I may actually try their delivery service.
The staff clearly works hard and was very quick to help us throughout dinner.

I'm glad i live close by....... :)"}
{"text":"The food from here is usually pretty good.  Typically the Pad Thai is the best around, but I was disappointed today.  It was dry. I hope they didn't change their recipe-it just wasn't right today. Much of the food delivered was cold, and it took over an hour rather than the 45 minutes we were quoted. I get it... it's delivery... it's not going to be as hot as it would in the restaurant. Cold tempura is awful. Egg rolls are edible cold-ish. The shu mai didn't remotely seem like it contained shrimp, although the texture and the sauce were good. The crispy crab wontons were just awful. Usually it's the best around, but tonight they were cold, limp , a bit too dark, and had non-existent filling. They were my dinner, and I could barely eat one. I was SO disappointed. We didn't get any fortune cookies, and we definitely missed them bc they're very good. Just a terribly disappointing experience. We usually look forward to ordering from Orient, but it's a good thing this wasn't our first experience, be it would have been our last. We'll give them one more shot, but if it's like this, that'll be the end of this relationship. Also, when you deliver, hand the person the pen and receipt first. Not the food, and then expect them to juggle when their hands are full and you hand them the receipt to sign. Delivery 101."}
{"text":"Currently on the sofa recovering from a night of vomiting and other not-so-pleasant side effects as a result of consuming the sushi here. 

Last night was my first visit here and I was ordering under the AYCE sushi menu. As a sushi fanatic from Southern California, I made my typical big first round order that I would do at any other AYCE sushi restaurants. With salmon beinf my favorite fish, I especially made sure to order a good amount of those. Unfortunately, it was the salmon that had gotten me sick. With my first bite of Salmon nigiri, I noticed right away that the fish was definitely not fresh and tasted awful. I started giving other fishes a try (albacore, tuna, octopus, etc) and although some of them might been safe to eat, I started feeling nauseous. I wasn't even full or anything but the sushi that I had I ate was on the brink of coming back up. 

At that point, I spoke to the manager to voice my displeasure and explain that I was unable to finish the rest of my order. He insisted that their fish were bought fresh daily and eventually decided to overcharge me for not finishing the rest of my order. He was not sympathetic of how their food had gotten me sick immediately after consumption rendering me unable to eat the rest of the food. Perhaps he thought I was faking my symptoms but I assure you all that the sushi they served me was the cause of my food poisoning. I paid the overcharged bill anyways since I wanted to leave so bad. They offered me to take the remaining sushi to-go but I declined in hopes that the sushi be discarded in the trash where it can not contaminate anybody else. 

To comment on other aspects, customer service was alright. I've read others complaining about the manager being rude but I disagree. I think it's just the way he speaks. All the other stuff I had ordered was lacking as well. Just a very poor attempt at a sushi restaurant. 

I typically do not post reviews but I must warn others of the risks of eating here. Their decent reviews swayed me to give them a try and boy do I regret that decision."}
{"text":"Philly Roll is one of a kind! Never had anything bad here. Be sure to try out the Spicy Scallops, Philly Roll, & Gilbert Roll!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting little restaurant. The food was delicious and came out fast. Nothing bad to say about the food.
It seems to be family run and there were a lot of random people walking in and out of the kitchen as well as kids running around. This also might be due to their midday closing. 
Great service and good food. Pricing is weird and thankfully explained by other yelpers."}
{"text":"Love this place ! The crab puffs are amazing and everything else we have ever gotten has been amazing great job guys ! Keep it up !"}
{"text":"I' ve been to a lot of sushi restaurants but this is really the worst one I've ever been to. We came as a party of 14 for a birthday; one of the first ones to be ones to be sat down (before the rush) and one of the last ones to leave (after the rush was over). The first part of our order for half our table came on time, but everything went downhill from there. The other half of our table waited over an hour for their order. There were parts of our half of the table's order that they completely forgot but marked that they brought it out. There were several tables that came in WAY after us but got their food way earlier and left even before we got our food. The sushi was so inconsistent for every order(somebody's eel sushi would come out nice while someone else's would look horrible). Service was also very unorganized and unwelcoming; our table was practically ignored the entire time. NEVER coming back here again for overpriced crappy sushi. If you want to get better all-you-can-eat sushi, go to Akita.

P.s. the server set our cake on fire."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. gave it 4 stars because it's wasn't my top ten places for sushi. All you can eat sushi is good."}
{"text":"This is my sushi place of choice. I have tried many of the sushi places near my house and the service is awful or the establishment is dirty.  Every time I go here the sushi is delicious, the staff is nice, and it is clean.  The prices are great and they have a one cent beer special."}
{"text":"Save your time energy and stress. Don't even step foot in this place. Such a joke. From the moment we walked in the manager (owner) I'm not sure was being rude to her employees scolding them like children. The server looked embarrassed. 

We were seated by said rude lady who didn't really say much and dropped the menus. We came here since it was recommended and bypassed or normal Sushi spot. Big mistake.... So once we were seated nothing there were multiple people working yet no one would come to our table to serve us. No one even brought us water. 5 minutes in I was annoyed... I was hangry when we got there and was looking forward to miso. Server came to the table next to us we tried to get his attention.... No luck. I told my husband we should leave, we decided to give them 3 more minutes, since now we have been there at least 10 minutes with absolutely zero acknowledgement. Another table was sat two away from us they get served right away. Someone comes to their table and asks what they would like to drink/eat. 
That was my breaking point. We got up to leave and were walking out, only to be finally acknowledged with a thank you for coming, I let him know we had never been served, so we were leaving. 

I would suggest Ninja for all you can eat in the close vicinity. I will not waste my time or energy ever again at this poor  excuse for a restaurant. Learn to serve your customers. Be pleasant to the customers and acknowledge them or at least let them know a server will be right with them."}
{"text":"Love their Magolian beef but hate their Kun Pao Chicken"}
{"text":"We ordered from here for the first time today and it will certainly not be the last time! 

We had pad thai, chow mein, Philadelphia roll, Gilbert roll, and spider roll. I really think they were to die for! Would highly recommend this place!
Delivery was incredibly fast as well!"}
{"text":"First time trying it and it was BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"So I had a mixed reaction to the Sushi from this Oriental Grill... my daughter and I visited this location Monday and before entering the local ... we came across three young men (nice looking young men if I do say so myself)...any how we asked these men if the food was any good... they at then assured me that it was and that it was reasonably priced ... this peeked my interest \"Whattttt! Reasonably priced Sushi!!!... Who, What, Where ... and What's the catch?'.... I guess I should have been concerned by their statement seeing as half their food from dining in appeared to be in the carry out boxes they held.

So we entered and was created by the hostess who directed us to the to go menus.  My daughter and I reviewed the menu and as the hostess has disappeared we then went to the sous chef that was preparing the sushi. \"Can you tell me what's in the Maki?\"... I asked while showing him what was on the menu they provided ... his response was a \"huh, and I don't understand\"... fine I'll chalk it up to not being fluent in English.  So I asked the next chef ... who proceeded to tell me that they don't have Maki... (hmm but it's on your menu dude)... okay whatever let's see what else you got 

I then see something called Firecracker shrimp ... this looks good... at this point the hostess re appeared \"Hi, can you tell me what's in the firecracker shrimp?\".... she like old at me like I spoke a foreign language ... I repeated.   She proceeds to tell me that she doesn't know and then she goes to the back and then calls the owner up front to assist us ... and boi was she a firecracker ... after much debate between the two of them ... for which I didn't understand what was being said I decided 'Forget it'... so I see the fried rice and it says clearly in its description ( rice fried with egg, carrots, peas, onion, bean sprouts and green onion)... I again point to it and say ... \"I'll just get the fried rice\"... this lady is so rude and keeps trying to push meat on me to get on the rice... and so I'm like 'ah, nooooo!'.....I don't want no meat just the rice like it says on the menu'.... I mean really ... so this lady catches an attitude with me and gets mad and says 'we have to charge you for a large order and add extra egg ... okay fine whatever ... ya lucky I'm hungry cause she was being so EXTRA!... then she asks me what else ... 'what else what!' ... I don't want anything else!  I finally just paid and left to go to the car .... and wait for my daughter to bring the food back to the car ... I was over it !

The food was okay... when I got my rice there was a huge fried egg on top along with the fried eggs on the rice itself ... 

The service ... the service ... hmmm it doesn't even bear repeating ... let's just say ... if you have a menu, honor the items you have on the menu ... and don't be rude to ur customers. As they could be a foodie like me and write a review.  I can honestly say that her husband came out and was very friendly ... so I don't know if he was cleaning up wifeys mess or if he was one of those husbands that was just trying to roll with her punches 

Atmosphere... the atmosphere was nice for a day time spot where you could dine and enjoy a quiet moment before that next business meeting"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. We have gone once and the food is SO good, quick service and the saki deal is one you cant beat. We used to drive out to Tempe for sushi and pay triple the amount until we discovered this little treasure. 

Only side note to pay attention to, they close for a few hours during the day from 2:30pm-4:30pm (mostly likely when they were slow due to people working etc) so, double check the hours before heading out!"}
{"text":"I always crack up when I get the bill here. Granted, my dude and I go late afternoon/early evening for our weekend feast, but we get 2 Saki Bombs, 2 apps, an entree, and 2 rolls of sushi for ~$30. Clincher--it's great food and we bring home a second meal! My review would be 5 stars for sure if they brought the old recipe back for drunken noodles. That dish WAS my favorite from anywhere in the valley. It used to be perfection, now it's kind of dry and there's too much fish sauce in the recipe...I think that's what I taste anyhow. I still like the dish, but it used to be a little saucier (but not fish-saucier). Anywho, it would be awesome to see my fave dish restored to its original brilliance. I would 5-star this place like crazy."}
{"text":"Gem! We love to eat here, quality food, customer support and always clean! We go here about once or twice a month. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and bring family.  Staff is friendly, food is fresh and its at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone to this place several times and really enjoy sitting at the sushi bar.  The food is consistently good. The reason for the 2 stars is the poor customer service. We normally order one saki bomber.  The menu says $6.50 but when you order, the server offers a large beer without mentioning this \"penny\" beer special so then we are charged 11.50 for the 6.50 menu bomber.   We talked to the server twice and nothing was done. If you are going to run a great beer special then offer it to your customers.  There are a couple of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better food along with good customer service and who promote their specials.  Not going back to this place again."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this sushi restaurant. They have a fantastic menu with a variety of food. The service we got was excellent. The waiter was quick and helpful. We ordered and within 10 minutes we had our sushi at our table. The turn around time is quick and efficient here. We ordered three rolls and all three were delicious. Very good rolls and fresh fish. The flavors were bold and so fresh. Finally, the pricing you can't beat. They have super competitive pricing for sushi and you can't get much better than this. Great price sushi that is quality. I look forward to attending this restaurant again. My overall experience was great, because the service was fantastic, the atmosphere was great and the sushi was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the valley. Love the food and customer service. Never had a bad meal or experience"}
{"text":"Blah. Appetizers were good. Calamari was yummy. That's where it ends. Got 4 different rolls. None were memorable. Stopped eating them because the taste was off. Server was too busy doing her side work to leave to take care of us. Sodas stayed empty, no check backs but she cod ask for the Soy Sauce on the table to refill with the rest. It was only 8pm and they close at 10. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Lady taking a takeout order could not speak much English at all. Very difficult to understand. 

I asked for the curry chicken very spicy.  She laughed. Sadly, as you can see in the pic the chicken curry came out as MILD/MILK TOAST as possible. I feel cheated. Seriously. What a sad situation. ABSOLUTELY NO SPICE AT ALL - my mom could have eaten it - and KETCHUP IS TOO SPICY for her. What a letdown. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"My opinion....best in all of Phoenix! I would love for someone to recommend one they think is better because Orient Sushi is AWESOME! If there is one better I would love to try it but I've been to a lot around town & so far nothing better. The quality & price is the best. The staff...the best!  I have not had one bad meal there...love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"Visit on 9/11/15:

I was in the mood for sushi and this place came up on my yellow pages find.  I had seen it a few times when I use to go to Wild Buffalo wings next door, but never tried it out.  When we got there, there were 2 groups ahead of us waiting on tables.  There were only 4 chairs to sit down on, and not a lot of room in their foyer.  There were seats at the sushi bar, and booths along the south wall.  Behind the hostess desk were tables and booths, a massively large TV, and cases of imported beer against the north wall.  I think we waited a total of 15 minutes before being seated.  We checked out the entire menu and decided to order soft shell crab appetizer.  The crab was small, breaded nicely, and came with a tangy but sweet sauce.  We ordered a California roll, soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura roll, and tuna roll.  The food came out in 2 sections which made it easier for us to eat and digest our meal.  With our drinks, our bill came to $38 before tip."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Great sashimi and sushi for the price! I love the friendly sushi chef Allen and waitstaff. All you can eat at 19.95.
I am trying to get back here on a weekend night for 1 cent bottles of beer. Sounds great to me!
The price/value cannot be beat imho. The very very large soup bowls look fantastic and the rolls are nice and fat!"}
{"text":"The unlimited sushi was very worth it. Infact the wife and I ate about $80 dollars worth of food and only walked with a $50 bill. Not bad for unlimited food. Next time I go back i'll get the sashimi deal. I like straight raw fish better than having all the sauces, avocado, rice, and cream cheese get in the way of tasting the real sea food flavors."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. They got our entire order correct and the food arrived at our table quickly. Everything was prepared well and was delicious."}
{"text":"My go-to spot in Gilbert to get my Sushi grub on! My wife and I usually do \"all you can eat\" here, and we go a step higher and upgrade to the \"all you can eat sashimi\"! It is SOOO worth it to do this!!! The difference between all you can eat and the sashimi version is $24 vs $30!!! BUT, this is OUR preference so it may not be yours. The reason my wife and I do this is because we LOVE salmon and tuna! And without eating rice, we NEVER get full without getting our moneys worth, in fact TWICE our moneys worth! We will seriously wipe out a whole slab of salmon before we've decided to switch to another fish or other item on the menu. 

A negative though to this sashimi all you can eat, is we experienced getting some still-frozen salmon sashimi when it was really busy and when we order a ton of it. We get it, they probably didn't have enough to accommodate our huge order, PLUS it was super busy, so they didn't have time to thaw a lot of the frozen salmon slabs. 

To pay $6 more to avoid that excessive amount of rice you eat when you try to stuff your face with all these sushi rolls is definitely worth it. I feel like I can order a lot more rounds of sushi, and it's actually quite healthy if you're only eating fish, maybe some rolls if you're feeling the urge for a little rice. 

This place is probably the best sushi place near Gilbert but trust me when I say, we're not the only ones that knows about this place! They are many loyal customers that will come here often with their kids, their families, and their friends so here are some helpful tips:

1) Best things to order are: sashimi salmon, sashimi tuna, baked salmon and scallop roll (THE BEST roll ), crunchy California rolls with eel sauce, eel sashimi, spicy scallop, and more salmon! Lol
2) you HAVE to go at less busy times, or else the wait is pretty long, AND your \"all you can eat\" experience will be hindered since they have to accommodate to so many people. You might end up waiting for your next orders for quite awhile! 
3) don't waste your time on the additional fillers on the all you can eat menu like fried rice, or weird dim sum items that shouldn't even belong in a Japanese restaurant"}
{"text":"So first of all, let me start off by saying that I'm usually a super nice guy when it comes to food service and quality and I usually give them the benefit of the doubt.  But I did NOT enjoy my visit to this place at all. We came here in a large group for a birthday. We drove almost 50 minutes out here because we heard from another friend that it was pretty good (he is no longer our friend after this). As a group we have been always big on sushi and have tried most of the AYCE sushi joints in AZ so 50 minutes is worth the drive if we can discover a new go-to place. We were split into 3 ordering sheets because we were rather large which made sense. I was in the last of the 3 groups to turn in the ordering sheet. The first group received half their order in about 25 minutes which included a sashimi boat and some appetizers. The presentation was pretty nice I'm not going to lie, but as they all say.. looks can be deceiving. The first thing that I heard them saying as they took the first bites was that it tasted like it just came out of the freezer. Also, the way they cut the fish was not like other sushi restaurants. It seemed like they cut random different parts of the fish in every order of the same sashimi/nigiri. 

We finally got 1/3 of our order after 40 minutes, another 1/3 of our order after another 20 minutes, and the last part of our order NEVER came. They gave us the the sheet back and we can see that they would cross out our orders of 6, after giving us only 3. The other groups had missing items from their sheet as well. I mean I can see why they took awhile to get our orders to us because 1) we were a large party and 2) it got quite busy after we came. But that's no excuse to not complete our order. 

To be honest, I am easily pleased with the quality of food compared to most of my friends, but I couldn't stand to eat much here even though I blew off (31$ including tip and tax) on the bill. Also, the raw salmon was really mushy which was disappointing because it's one of the things I look forward to most.

It's safe to say that we won't be returning to this place... EVER... Our top choice is still Akita Sushi in Scottsdale. Their prices are so much more reasonable, and their quality is a lot better.

*If you do decide to go here for some odd reason, try the Gyoza, it was actually decent."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for sushi, GO HERE!  Orient is amazing.  I've been coming here for 3 years and it's by far my favorite affordable sushi joint.  

Their selection is good, and the prices are unbeatable.  My husband and I come here and make it out the door for under $20 for dinner (including tip).  On top of the great value, the sushi is always fresh and delicious.  I've never been disappointed in a roll.  And if you like fried rice, try the House Special Fried Rice.  It's incredible.

I'm surprised to see that some reviewers were disappointed in the service!  We have always received excellent service here, even when it's busy.

I'm glad to see Orient is still around & thriving, despite the failure of other restaurants in the complex.  I'm happy to be a patron of a local restaurant that goes above and beyond in the areas of value, service, and quality.  I'll be a customer for many years to come!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Sushi restaurant! I absolutely love the Gilbert roll. The prices are great especially for the sushi that you get. Me and my husband went on a Friday night and he was pretty busy but we were seated immediately at the bar. The atmosphere is great! And they have an all you can eat option if you're feeling up to it. And I love love love this place"}
{"text":"Been hitting this place hard for the last four years and I keep coming back for the tea, drink specials and the understanding that I want fish. And I want it now. I bring all my work friends and we tear up the all you can eat. They are always happy to see us. They don't give us the \"you eat and go home Na eat sushi all day\". They welcome everyone's requests for extra spicy mayo and never complain when we go through dish after dish. We make compitions on who eats the most sushi. Regardless this place doesn't hold back when I have ordered to go. I get free food with my orders. They love me here. They know who I am. The chef prepared my chirashi without asking. I couldn't ask for better service or fish. This isn't a high end perfect cut sushi. It's a home with friendly faces and hot miso soup. No matter what people say. This place is a gold mine in the land locked Arizona state."}
{"text":"Sushi delivery!

I know it sounds weird, but these guys are legit when it comes to sushi delivery. They pack the cold stuff in ice and pack the warm stuff separate. All sushi is half off all the time and the minimum for delivery is $20 so you get a ton of food for cheap.

Fresh, delicious, fast, cheap...what more could you possibly want!?"}
{"text":"Great Sushi and other dishes  with reasonable price!
I love the softcrab/eel sushi and Pad Thai, grilled fish...
Service is beyond most of other restaurants."}
{"text":"I.. had a dream: A quality AYCE sushi joint was located in my very own kitchen so that I would never be too far from the endless plates of mouth-watering seafood creations. Of course I then woke up to the harsh reality that I need to actually drive to get to one - life ain't easy folks.. Sometimes, when life serves you lemons you just have to make - er.. Sushi?

Shmeagle Warning: We WILL remove this review if my precccious gets too crowded with all you hungry hobbitzes."}
{"text":"You cannot beat their all you can eat sushi. Ordering off the menu. Not the typical boat that drifts by with cheap rolls. This was the good stuff. And for a penny more, you get a beer. What more can you ask for. But you better eat it all."}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday night and they were pretty busy, love that you can do all you can eat sushi for $23! The choices are not bad either. However be aware since it is all you eat you cannot leave any sushi they see as wasteful on your plates they do charge if you waste. Which I get that but could be a problem if your a person that over orders all the time thank goodness I had my hubby and son help me out, they ordered their own choices from the all you can eat as well. We do try a lot of sushi places and the sushi here is good. I probably stick to the revolving sushi places we usually go to though."}
{"text":"This is my new fav Asian cuisine. Sushi and service are great, but the Orient Chicken and garlic sauce are amazing!"}
{"text":"Hour after I place my delivery order I get a call... asking  why I haven't picked up my order.... I told them delivery 3 times...I bust my ass I the kitchen all day and the only day I choose not to cook these idiots fuck it up.. I just want fucking food... now it's too late to order anywhere... never again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last year since we moved to this area. This place seems to never disappoint and is considered a hidden gem among sushi places in the valley. It's tucked away in the shopping plaza and often driven past from the Elliot rd. 

I've tried almost everything on the menu and everything has been great. The sushi is really good and affordable , the portion is just right and isn't anything to argue with. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Great place for drinks and food! 

The take out experience was also fanatic as I ordered 2 rolls and 1 main dish. They pack ice under your rolls so they stay cool during transit. Very considerate in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been a consistent customer and recently moved. I moved 5 mins more down the road and they refused to deliver to me even though I was still in the area! Horrible! I have spent so much money here and this place is LAZY!"}
{"text":"We usually go at lunch time, their specials are excellent and reasonably priced. Last Friday we went for dinner, they had a 2 for 1 beer special, $4 for the two Japanese bottled beers. They had a raw clam special that was very tasty. Their potion sizes are ridiculously large which could be a problem but we just asked for the to go boxes in advance and split the portions to a more manageable size. 

They do have a problem with the music that they play. For some reason 'Danny Boy' has been playing every time we have visited. I will ask about it next time."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to review this place! Ugh! Well for starters, me likey! My bestie lives right across the street from this place and she's a regular here w/her hubby. One time she suggested this place as one of our lunch dates a couple of years ago. Props to her! I haven't had the \"all you can eat for $20\" sushi deal (which she loves), but I do come for a couple things each visit. I really LOVE their Orient Special Chicken - boneless chicken marinated with a special sauce & fried to crispiness, served with garlic and onion sauce. I also like to accompany that with their Roll Combo A - 8 pc CA roll and 5pc shrimp tempura roll which I share with either my oldest son or hubster. My son loves their Chicken Katsu! Their bento boxes have great portions and there's a soup that comes with the meal (egg drop or hot and sour).
FYI - this is during lunch hour (the best time for these deals with their prices!).

The ambiance and the music playing overhead is dull and they could put on something else on the TV other than CNN, especially when they seat you towards that area in the side/back. I think the staff could be a little more interactive with their customers, but the food is what takes the cake and I'm happy with that!

I'm a CA native and I've had really fresh sushi, but this will satisfy my sushi cravings just fine AND it's close by! I only come during the weekday lunch hour because of the deals, but will have to try it out during dinner time & on the weekends..."}
{"text":"Their all you can eat is really good! The one cent corona that comes with it is a nice added bonus. Fish always fresh. Very nice staff. The appetizers are also worth the try, especially the tempura calamari."}
{"text":"Best place to go for all you can eat sushi AND sashimi! 
Very reasonably priced for all the options you get when choosing from the all you can eat menu. They also have a big menu for the non sushi friends you bring. They have more than just the standard teriyaki and rice bowls. I always want to try their regular food but the All you can eat sashimi wins my heart every time."}
{"text":"I came here with Gene T. and Hillary T. on Saturday July 6th. She got the chicken katsu deal, he got the sushi roll combo and I got the all you can eat sushi (of course) The miso soup I got was pretty good, average honestly. I got some crab wontons which were a little too dry for me, but still okay.... i think if you order all you can eat you should get a half order of like 4 instead of 6 or 8. I also got tempura which was also average. The masago was great, no compalints at all :) The makarel was also average. I can't remember the other fish I got, but I also got a Las Vegas Roll which was okay, not the greatest. But hey for all you can eat I think its a decent place."}
{"text":"I have dined here several times and always have a good experience.  Last dined here on June 5 and had another great meal and excellent service.  Their all you can eat sushi dinner special is a great value and the food is always very good.  This is one of my favorite neighborhood eateries."}
{"text":"We love this place!! We have been coming here for years and it just keeps getting better!!! Great food at very reasonable prices!! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi but not the best customer service .... would have loved to give this place 4 stars but their customer service and attentiveness was not the best - we had 4 people ignore us and one guy finally help but he was in a really bad mood - we had a party of 5 for their sushi a la carte on a slow Sunday and it seemed as though they really didn't want to service us .... the food was good and we liked it but really wish the customer service was nicer"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for sushi! We have been coming here since they opened. We typically get the all-you-can-eat sushi for a little over 20 bucks a person, which includes a seaweed salad, avocado salad and soup. We tend to eat early ...  On the few times we've gone late it does get busy but well worth it!! Service is friendly and we don't wait long for our order once we have placed it."}
{"text":"Decided to come back and give it a second try, and this place is still shit.. I was nice and kind to the server and informed him that the HR is handroll instead of a full role and his reply was \"i know\" with a retarded facial expression. Tried the sea weed salad and it looks dead.. The sushi is still trash tasting. Do not come."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that their sushi is always 'half off' which equates to it is cheap. I went here for lunch today and had a cucumber roll and the sushi with the egg bar thingy on the top (good description, huh?). The sushi was tasty...although it's pretty hard to mess up this order as it doesn't have any fish, but my cucumber rolls were not cohesive. They came apart at the seems and everything started falling out....pretty not great, but otherwise it did taste good. I would go back because it is cheap and convenient (right near my internship)."}
{"text":"A sushi place that delivers!!!! What!!???

I got one of their flyers in the mail and saw that they delivered so I figured I'd try it out. I've never heard of a sushi place that delivers before. I ordered the philly roll and the chandler roll. The chandler roll comes with crab meat, avocado, topped with baked salmon. My boyfriend ordered their chicken Katsu since he doesn't eat sushi. For $9 it's actually a very big portion. He had plenty of leftovers for the next day and it was actually pretty tasty. 

I think the sushi is pretty decent here and reasonably priced. Everything was half off. And the delivery time was around 30 minutes. They also have $23.99 for all you can eat sushi. You can also get penny beers with this special."}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Saturday. We were the only people in the place through the whole meal. It is in a strip mall and the ambiance feels like a fast food place.
  I ordered the sushi combo B. I got a California roll and a spicy tuna roll for about $7.00. this came with a salad and pretty good hot and sour soup. The sushi was fresh and very good, nothing exceptional. I would put this place on my list of sushi places to return to if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. We have tried a few in the valley and keep coming back here. Prices are pretty good and they have a decent selection of soup on the cold nights.We love shrimp tempura roll for only $5."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place! They have both Ayce and regular menu. Ayce menu is great because for 29.95 you get Ayce Sashami! First place I have been to that does this and it's amazing ! 

If you love fresh sushi, this is it. Come in on the days they get it delivered, I believe Monday, Wednesday and Friday's for the super fresh taste. I am picky and do call beforehand to make sure it came in that day, I feel like it just tastes better. With Ayce you get all the Sashami you want and no fillers. 

Be careful when ordering anything else as they tend to be large. Do not order the kitchen dishes like Mongolian beef off the Sashami Ayce unless you're a large party as it's a full size meal! If you know how Ayce works, you pay for left over food, so order slowly what you can eat. 

Tried almost all their different types of Sashami and they're all super yummy. My personal favorite is the Salmon and the yellowtail. 

Their butter fried calamity was scrumptious !

Pro tip : for 2$ order Fresh wasabi .. so much better tasting than the horseradish stuff.  

Hands down the best sushi place in Phoenix. Trust me we've been to like all of them and always were disappointed. I do like sushi station too but this is different level."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi snob and all you can eat is not my thing.  Also, this place is chinese owned and operated.  With that being said, they do have decent fish and you really can't complain about the price.  Even better, go on Saturday and get your second beer for a penny.  The guys behind the counter and the wait staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! Avocado and Gilbert Rolls are great. Goes great with Chicken Katsu or Honey Chicken. Great neighborhood place to eat."}
{"text":"I will never waste my money here again. This is the second time I've ordered and the sushi is mediocre at best. First, I live within 5 miles which is their delivery range. Google Maps says I am 4.3 miles away yet they charged me an extra $2 because they said I was not in their delivery area. Then I realized they had forgotten the hot mustard that I had asked for so I called them and they delivered that but I gave the driver an extra tip since it was not his fault. So that was more money for something that should have been delivered to begin with. Lastly, when I called to tell them that they had forgotten the spring rolls I ordered and paid for, the woman gave me a very half hearted apology and offered me a credit for next time. They can take their credit and put it somewhere that will flavor their food better. The fried rice is tasteless and the chicken is spongy. The sushi rice was not sticky but rather gooey. The tempura was bland and the sauce was completely flavorless.  They claim to offer huge discounts on their sushi, but that's because they jack up the price and then cross it out on the menu as if they are doing you a favor. Save yourself money and go anywhere for sushi but this place. And if their fried rice is an indication of the rest of their food, don't bother going there for anything Asian at all."}
{"text":"Generally good quality and pretty fresh. Great for lunch and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Thsi place has great prices and great food, small
But cool, saw some crazy hot hookers here. Love the sushi and the regular
Orient food, its greaaaattt"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite neighborhood spots. Friendly, service. The owner is a wonderful lady and always remembers us and the kids. We have been coming here for years. It is our goal to spot for sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place the sushi is always fresh, rolls are always 50% off. 

It is a typical hole in the wall place. Atmosphere isn't the greatest but the food makes up for it.

On average when me and my partner go out for sushi we were usually spend $60 or more. But when we come here it's around $20. 
Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I struggled between 3 and 4 stars.  The staff is friendly, this is our go-to sushi place.  I noticed a couple of months ago and again last night, how bland and ordinary all of he sushi looks.  The taste is good and fresh but the presentation is lackluster and presentation is part of the experience. Does anyone know if they just make them look more plain for the all you can eat, because Im looking at pictures and ours looked nothing like those.  WE had about 8 different rolls and they basically all looked the same.  Is that unusual???After reading my own review,  not sure if I will return"}
{"text":"I would never frequent this place as it's 40+ miles from our house, but the husband works out in Gilbert so today I came to visit him and we went there to eat.  The place is great!!! And very inexpensive!  I ordered the Orient Chicken Special and for lunch, it's $5.95 and comes in a bento box filled with a large portion of chicken, garlic & onion dipping sauce, salad and rice.  Before that, it came out with a bowl of soup (I chose the hot & sour which was delicious).  The husband ordered the bento chicken katsu, which again came out as a large portion.  Our son had the kids chow mein with chicken for $4.95 and it came out in this huge dish!  The service was good and the food tasted great.  Oh! And their sushi is always half off, with the exception of their sashimi and specialty rolls.  We ordered the tootsie roll for $5.00 and it was really good!  If we lived closer, I'd definitely be eating at this place a lot more.  At least the husband has a great lunch spot to go to when he's at work."}
{"text":"This place is delicious ! So far it has been the best AYCE Sushi near us. Coming from the East Coast.. we have been here twice, both times we had a good experience. Plenty of options off the AYCE menu, just keep in mind portions are huge !!!"}
{"text":"I stopped for a quick lunch. I wasn't expecting much since last time I went was so so. I was great! You can't beat their lunch deals, soup, salad and 2 sushi rolls for $6.95! That's a lot of food. Everything was very good and it was very quick. 
I definitely will return!"}
