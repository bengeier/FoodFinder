{"text":"They have this baked red snapper roll with some sort of mayo sauce. Don't know the name but it's a must! It's not on the all you can eat menu but def worth the extra money to get it! Their all you can eat has a great selection and their fish is always fresh and taste great. They also have Tempenyaki tables in the back where they cook on the table."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi in the area. They also serve sushi to vegetarians, very delicious too. Me and my friends' favourite restaurant these days."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Price, food and service was pretty good tonight. Considering it was vday and without reservations, this places did a very good job.   The cook could've been a little more entertaining, but other than that a pretty decent place for teppanyaki.  Other Japanese places would usually give you a little scope of ice cream to finish off the meal but, this place actually was pretty generous with their scope.  Will i come back... hard to say.  Not because it was bad, it is more of a location issue."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Staff also very courteous. Wish it had more parking."}
{"text":"FRESH, FRIENDLY STAFF , GREAT PRICE!!!!   Sushi den is BY FAR my most favourite spot to go for my weekly cheat meals on Sundays. There is no other sushi spot like them in the area , I even would choose them over a lot of spots downtown Toronto and or where I use to live in Oakville/Burlington area. They even have brown rice which is also very tasty. You won't ever be disappointed!  I can't wait until this coming Sunday lol :-)"}
{"text":"We have been to the Sushi Den quite a few times but last night they nailed it.  The ambiance on Saturday night is so exciting with the Tapanyaki area always full and a general liveliness throughout the entire restaurant.   The staff are very friendly and seemed to all be involved with our table, ensuring that we didn't go any amount of time without what we needed. They offered a complimentary 'amuse-bouche' that was absolutely delicious!  Everything that we ordered was prepared to perfection.  Our best experience yet, definitely will not be our last.    It appears as though they have very high standards and take feedback seriously.  They've raised the bar and it shows. Highly recommend Sushi Den."}
{"text":"WARNING TO ALL PARENTS - the food may be outstanding at this restaurant but if you bring a child, get ready to pay an adult price for your child.  I took my 7 year old there and did not realize this at all. What child eats as much as an adult? Completely wrong to charge adult pricing for children. I confronted the owner and he did not care the least.  Extremely disappointed and felt ripped off. An average child price at sushi restaurants is $11.99 not $23.99.  The food was definitely good but the feeling I had in the pit of my stomach after leaving was just awful. I don't mind paying but there's a difference between paying and purposefully over charging.   If your taking the kids, go somewhere else, or be prepared to pay through the roof for your wee ones to eat."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Place. E-V-E-R. Period. Most creative a-la cart! Presentation, atmosphere, variety and of course quality. Been a fan of this place since it opened and cant eat sushi from anywhere else. Once you go - you know."}
{"text":"Went for the AYCE and it was very good.  The kitchen dishes are excellent, and you can really tell that all of their fish is fresh.  The rolls are good, but the AYCE doesn't give you a massive selection to choose from, but it's still sufficient.  Service is very very good as all the servers are extremely helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Top star restaurant in Aurora!  Amazing costumer service and atmosphere for new families and those around in the area. Great pricing and totally worth your money;  creative a la cart and all you can eat lunch/dinner. There isnt some of good stuff on the lunch menu than there would be on the dinner menu but, other than that its still great! Sushi Den never disppoints anyone, known for great reservation, events, get togethers and birthdays! Not only is there just sushi and all you can eat but, they have teppanyaki. The chef's are great and very entertaining!"}
{"text":"A place where quality and quantity can meet ! Great sushi and rolls. Always fresh every time I go here. I've been to many all you can eat sushi places in aurora, here or sushi kui are probably the best."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Overpriced sushi, service is o.k. No mints... Taste of the food is o.k. Thus, not a recommended place I would go to."}
{"text":"Food is great with friendly service. Lots variety sections.   Bento boxes prices are very reasonable. They offer A La Cart menu or All U Can Eat menu."}
{"text":"Was at sushi den for dinner, didn't realize their AYCE is only available at lunch time. The dinner menu prices and the teppanyaki prices are a bit on the high side. Having said that, the sashimi dinner we ordered was quite good. The fish was very fresh and the complimentary cucumber appetizer was delicious. I find that it is quite quite pricey, especially the teppanyaki combos. Would come back, but won't be often due to the prices. Definitely more than $$"}
{"text":"Good fresh food.  Lunch specials till 3:00  Also offer all you can eat for those whom are hungry! Or you can order off regular menu.   I would go there again.   Parking is kind of brutal though. be fore-warned."}
{"text":"One of my fav Sushi places in the area.  Food is fresh and has great flavour. Service is quick. Also many delicious options for those who don't necessarily enjoy sushi."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to go to this place because I'm not the biggest sushi fan in the world, so the AYCE offer wasn't all that appetizing to me.  But my friends really wanted to go so I gave it a chance. I am SO glad I ended up going.  First off, the sushi is REALLY good, particularly for an AYCE place.  It's fresh and well prepared.    But even if you're not into sushi, the AYCE menu is packed FULL of amazing dishes.  There's pad thai, Singapore style noodles, crispy beef, popcorn chicken, gyoza, fried scallops... you name it, it's on there.  The sizes of the portions are perfect for groups as it's small enough for a couple people to enjoy a little.  They are surprisingly quick with the service, and the food always comes out fresh and yummy.  I can't recommend this place more.  Great price for really fantastic food.  I've been a couple times now and the service is consistently great."}
{"text":"Such great amazing food! Great service and my favourites are cucumber rolls and the sweet potato rolls"}
{"text":"It's disappointing that my favourite sushi place has taken such a downhill turn. I hadn't been in just under a year, and went the other day expecting the level of quality I am used to. I feel like it might be under new management or something, because how does a restaurant slip this much? Consistency is hugely important to me. Especially if you're something of a regular, and your expectations aren't even ALMOST met. Keep in mind, four years ago I made a yelp account JUST to rave about finding such a great local AYCE sushi place!  I get that prices naturally go up. But when prices go up, and quality goes way down, I don't feel I should support the business.  A lot of my favourite signature items have changed, with the quality and type of ingredients really downgraded. So all the things I normally get was just one disappointment after the other.  The service is still good, but unfortunately not much else is. I will probably go back in a little while to see if anything improves but other than that, I'm sorry to see the state this place is in. Friends of mine have lamented the same about this place, so I can't even suggest that they had an off day."}
{"text":"General atmosphere was nice in the restaurant, we were greeted and seated promptly.  This time we remembered to make a reservation since last time they were too busy to take us.   As a group we decided to go for the AYCE menu.  There weren't too many options for me here as a vegetarian (which was expected).   I had about 4 different types of maki sushi, the spicy sweet potato, and avocado roll were definitely my favorite. Tempura sweet potato was quite flavorless and I found the servers often weren't sure which item/roll was which - which concerned me a few times.    The ginger ice cream was surprisingly delicious!! I will be back, but next time I will definitely order from the a-la-carte menu since many options on there sounded more interesting compared to the AYCE menu.  Also will request a special table where they chef prepares each dish in front of you - seemed like there was a lot of excitement coming from that area of the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Their Teppanyaki cooking is amazing. Cozy little section in the back with seating enough for family and friends at one table. The chefs are entertaining, cooking your food in front of you and giving it to you piece by piece so you can sample everything in its glory. Be prepared to spend longer than usual eating. You will be happily dated at the end of your meal. Will definitely be back to try their AYCE sushi menu next time."}
{"text":"Located along Wellington just west of Industrial sideroad (and almost hidden by the Aurora GO Transit station), lives a secret mystical den... a Sushi Den.  From the outside you'd expect this place to be a small, modest venue with a traditional sushi counter and a few small tables, however upon opening their doors you enter into a vast chasm of a restaurant with high ceilings, a gorgeous bar area, a raised dining area to the left and an open Teppanyaki area to the back.  Thanks to the Yelp app, I was able to find this place when a sushi craving hit recently and my 'regular spot' just wasn't cutting it for me anymore. I'd seen the change over from Honba to Sushi Den several months ago and had put it on my mental back-burner to try.  Being seated for lunch, I was amazed at how inexpensive the AYCE lunch option was. Consistent with others in terms of offerings (no sashimi - made me sad), I'd do this for lunch on the regular based on price alone. To echo the sentiments of several other yelpers here, aside from price, the clear x-factor at Sushi Den is the attention to detail and high quality standards. One of the freshest sushi spots I've had the pleasure of dining at in recent memory - it's easy to understand why their rating is so high on Yelp.  Staff were friendly, quick, and efficient, and ready to clear dishes the moment they were emptied... OH and so polite! Our server actually did a slight bow at one point!!  The lunch was enough to get me to come back and switch allegiances in Aurora, but what's got my interest piqued for dinner is their Teppanyaki tables at the restaurants read which we were informed came on a sliding price scale AND the main guy who does it is apparently hilarious! I can't wait to return and I hope the staff, food quality and prices all stay the same - they are perfect just as they are!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere - great value! Had the chicken teriyaki, very tasty. Came with soup, appetizer, chicken, veggies and dessert for around $20. Go to the back to experience the Teppanyaki presentation. Good service, clean. Best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Wonderful special  sushi rolls and presentation. Decor extremely casual, but don't let it fool you. Food is great. Must try: Tex Mex, Fire Roll, Crispy Salmon , Jalapeños/Spicy Tuna, and Ginger Wasabi Rolls. Lastly, service was pleasant and accommodating. Will surely go back next trip to Toronto..."}
{"text":"Never had the Tenpanyaki, but the Sushi is amazing. The only place I've ever seen add green onion to their crab slaw, I always sit at the bar and enjoy my meal watching the brilliant sushi chefs and the head chef work away. Everything is well above standard and it's the best AYCE place in York Region."}
{"text":"Awesome and fresh sushi. Lunch all you can eat is very cheap for the size of the menu and quality of the food. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed by Sushi Den's a la cart menu and service when I went with a party of 7 (plus 2 toddlers).  The service was very friendly but not very good.  To start, our server only took half of our table's order then left.  When we finally realized that she wasn't coming back we had to ask someone else to take our order.  I ordered some nigiri sushi, a spicy red dragon roll, and seafood udon.  The server told me that my roll didn't come in spicy and I had to show her the menu where it explicitly states that dragon rolls can be made spicy.  When the food arrived, I got a spicy green dragon roll and sent it back because I wanted a spicy red dragon roll.  I got a non-spicy red dragon roll.  I also received a fried seafood udon instead of the soup.  The server took that back too and came back with the soup.  I will say that the server was quite pleasant throughout this whole ordeal.  The food itself was good, not great.  The nigiri had too much rice and the fish wasn't as fresh as I had hoped.  The dragon roll (aside from not being spicy like I ordered) was tasty but the udon surprisingly didn't have too many noodles.  Overall, I guess I can't complain too much since it is an AYCE restaurant, so the quality was that of an average AYCE restaurant.  I've been here for AYCE as well and haven't been impressed.  I feel that Sushi Den is pretty average overall although the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Sushi Den Teppanyaki is a new restaurant that takes over of where Honda used to be.  The place is renovated and now owned by Chinese (Honda was owned by Korean -  thus, no more Korean food on menu).  Overall the food was pretty good and service was excel.  They even gave us a free appetizer.  Lunch special starts from 7.99 and most of them include miso soup and salad.  Since it is newly opened, teppanyaki was not ready yet.  I will definitely go back again to try teppanyaki."}
{"text":"My husband likes this place way more than I do. I have a few faves on their menu including the Ebbi shooter and mushroom and beef rolls. Eating at that teppanyaki table is a fun treat. The chefs interact with the guests in humorous ways including food throwing, volcanic smoke and egg cracking. I think the staff are all very friendly but some need more training on alcohol knowledge."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating is an average between my two visits. On my first visit, my fiancé and I had their a la carte sushi. Everything was presented beautifully and fresh. Service was quick and friendly and I loved how they put carnation flowers in their sushi for the added wow factor. Martini glasses were used for dipping sauces and everything was done to make sure we were impressed by their sushi, which we were. That visit deserves a 5 star rating.   Recently, we came here for their teppanyaki for my fiancé's birthday. A large group of us went and it was pretty easy making a reservation for 15 people. Drinks were constantly refilled and service was prompt and friendly. A few things were out of stock in terms of sushi that was ordered a la carte, but they were very apologetic about it. We were a bit disappointed with their teppanyaki. Price wise, Sushi Den is on par with other teppanyaki places. The standard miso, green salad, fried rice, and dessert are included with whatever protein you choose.   We were underwhelmed with the presentation factor. Going to teppanyaki even in Mexico, I found they made more of an effort for the show factor. The chef was upbeat and funny in Mexico. Here, they did the standard egg toss, egg breaking with the guests, and the onion volcano. Other than that, nothing was done for the show part of dinner. Our chef was very kind, but not as outgoing as I'd hope. Food was cooked well and to our preference.   The reason why I am not giving the teppanyaki portion of my review a higher rating is that the other half of our table apparently had a chef that didn't care for what he was doing. From what we heard, he drank half a beer in front of our friends and wasn't very enthused to do the standard teppanyaki tricks. He even left half way through his cooking and had our chef finish for him. Very unprofessional if you ask me.   I would give the teppanyaki portion 3 stars. I would come back for sushi, but not teppanyaki. Maybe we will try their all you can eat next."}
{"text":"People and food are very good. Nice decor and good menu. One issue: some of the rice was hard to eat - very vinegary. That's an unforgettable rookie mistake.   Won't go back even though it's one of the best choices in the area. Desert also took a very long time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi restaurants in the GTA and I like that it's so close to home. I've had both AYCE sushi and the teppanyaki on different occasions. The service is great. The teppanyaki is a show in itself, their chefs are talented and have a good sense of humour. They have a few rolls which are exclusive to them but I especially love their sushi pizza. I must get out there again soon!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is for AYCE. They have an extensive menu for their AYCE dinner ($23.99) Offerings include appetizers, sushi rolls, hand rolls, sashimi, and dessert. The freshness of the sushi is average. The hot menu items were delicious. I enjoyed the salmon teriyaki, chicken katsu, and marinated beef short ribs. Atmosphere is nice and great for a date night night or night out with some friends. At the back of the restaurant they offer tepanyaki which  seemed lively and entertaining."}
{"text":"Sushi Den was pretty great. I came here on a Sunday for lunch.  As Kris said, it's located beside the Go station on Wellington. It is beside a day spa I believe. There is parking in the front and in the back. The interior was nice and dimly lit. We were seated on a raised area by the window which was pretty. All you can eat lunch was about 15 dollars with tax (I like dat). The food was pretty good, they give you big portions. I thought with 3 guys at the table it was okay if we over ordered but we had a tough time finishing it all. I ate A LOT. I tried salmon sushi, spicy salmon sushi and maki, tempura, seaweed salad, and spicy crab maki.  The spicy salmon was good, although not great. I didn't like the tempura (although I'm not the biggest fan to begin with). The salmon sushi and seaweed salad were really good. I also really liked the ice cream, the green tea one tasted so creamy. They only offer green tea, mango, and vanilla ice cream for dessert during lunch. The service was pretty good. The tea was delicious and always refilled, the only issue I had was we were never given a bill nor told to pay at the bar. We were just left waiting at the table for ten minutes until we decided to go find the register. A heads up would have been nice. I liked Sushi Den but would probably want to try what else Aurora has to offer before I returned here.  ***I almost forgot*** they gave us some complimentary rice paper spring roll thing to try which was AMAZING.  I don't know what it was called but I loved it, I wish I was only eating that for lunch. It was so good."}
{"text":"Want a show with you yummy fewds? Heck ya... Chef doing tricks with eggs on the cooktop as he prepares your food in front of your eyes, its good entertainment espically when your with a group, good for corporate meals , that sort of thing. On a side not there is a all you can eat sushi menu if you didnt want the whole teppanyaki show and meal and everything is nice and freshly prepared, good sake to sip on with your meal or order a sapporo to wash your yummy food down with. Honestly not the cheapest place to eat but worth the extra few $'s . Check it out !!"}
{"text":"Review of the sushi part of it, have not tried the tepannyaki side.  On One of our visits, we got the sushi boat (for a smaller meal), and a great part of it was rolls with imitation crab. The boat did not have much variety. The food is good, but did not stand out much.  Service was good, restaurant is clean...  The all you can eat is probably better, the choice is up to you. We also got take out on a couple of occasions, reliable."}
{"text":"Expectations Anihilated.  It had been a while since I visited, when it went under the name of Honba.  Still a nice place, less Japanese looking and more in line with a nice mainstream restaurant.  The hostess offered me the choice of menu or AYCE.  I looked at both, because I find it hard to trust AYCE.    Inspecting the AYCE menu, I noticed something strange--Sashimi?  On an AYCE menu?  I thought the point of AYCE was to load you up on carbs so the restaurant saves on the cost of protein!  I was onto their game.  I knew the sushi would likely be thinner on the fish than I like, so for each piece of sushi, I ordered a piece of sashimi to make a legal sized morsel.  Then I noticed they had Tuna Maki, so expecting the heinous \"white tuna\", I asked the server.  He confirmed it was Red Tuna (the primo or \"ichiban\" stuff).  So I went with the AYCE, ordering about the standard amount I have for a light meal.  MISTAKE!  The Salmon sashimi slices that arrived were the size of a Chevy!  The Tuna Maki that is about the diameter of a pencil at other places was as thick as your thumb!  And the Red Dragon Rolls?  HUGE!  This is a place that, for a couple of bucks more, gives you a serious feed of sushi.  Great quality, upscale environment.  And no need to travel to Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Fun place for a big meal and some easy-going entertainment.  My family (husband, kids, in-laws) went here for my husband's birthday and really enjoyed ourselves. We were looking for a local Teppanaki spot for a bit of fun and we're happy to find this place only a few blocks from our house.  The lady who served us was excellent. We were there on a Tuesday and the place was relatively busy (one large Teppanaki party and quite a few smaller tables for sushi) but we were very well attended to.   Pros:  Service was excellent. Our server (I think she might be the manager or owner) took a lot of pride in the food, culture and experience. She proactively made recommendations and checked on us often without crowding us. I also thought it was really neat that she shared some I information about Sake tasting.   Our Teppanaki chef was very good. A younger guy, he was nice without being over the top. Admittedly, I enjoy the funny show that some places put on (there's a place near Vaughan Mills where we had a hilarious show with a very flamboyant chef), which this place doesn't do, but he was still really good; very personable and GREAT food. Yes...we got out onion volcano and lots of fire!  The Teppanaki comes with a lot of food. I would recommend one of the meals with scallops. Not only are they super tasty, but if you save the sauce, put it on your fried rice for pure bliss. Wicked.  There are only two Teppanaki stations, so best to make a reservation in advance just in case. We were a group of 5 (plus one baby) which was an ideal size. I think each Teppanaki table seats 12.   Cons:  One of the Teppanaki tables is situated next to the emergency exit. Not a big deal, but just wanted to point it out.  Located next to the Aurora Go station which can be good or bad depending on what time/day you go. The traffic in the area is brutal when a train lets out.  Like any other Teppanaki spot, it ain't cheap. It's a lot of food, so it's no bad value at all. You won't be grappling with Benihana pricing though!  Bottom line: I would recommend Sushi Den for Teppanaki.   I will provide an update if we go for sushi there."}
{"text":"Went there first time with my hubby, because saw it recommended by a Food Channel show. It is very convenient to get there, they were located just outside the Aurora GO Train station. Tried the sushi all-you can eat. The food choices offering was not huge, similar than in any AYCE restaurants. However, undoubtedly the fish was super fresh and tasty. The sushi rice under the sushi was made in perfection and soft. The noodles were actually Udon which was chewy and made perfect. I love the ginger ice cream which was not offered in many Japanese AYCE places we went to.  They also have Teppanyaki table section, what we can see, the people eating at there were having so much fun, there were lots of laughter and clapping. We saw the chef was using his flipping tools to throw foods into the people and they were trying to catch the food by their mouth. Their friends were taking videos and photos of it. Very entertaining.  The AYCE dinner is quite pricey compared to other restaurants. The decor of the restaurant was ruined by its plain scrap paper as tablecloth. It reminded me of parents who used to cover the table with paper so they don't need to clean the place when their kids make a mess. I think we as as grown-ups should deserve a decent tablecloth.  Parking is limited but we really like our server, a young western boy who was super polite, always telling us what the food was when he bring it to us. He was always so quick and proactive in taking out empty plates and offering us more hot green tea. Very polite and hardworking server indeed! Bravo for him! GOOD JOB AND REMEMBER TO KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT SERVICE!   I will definitely go back there for their taste, perfect for locals."}
{"text":"Went here for the teppanyaki with my teenage daughter and her friend for dinner.  Love this style of cooking as its very entertaining and was sooo good.   Fresh fish, lobster and sirloin and cooked perfectly.   All the sides -  rice, veggies and noodles were all very good.  Thank goodness for doggie bags as we had a lot of food to take home"}
{"text":"I think one of the better sushi joints close to my work!  You can pre-order for sit down or take out which is a blessing if you are short on time.  Their menu has lunch specials- I got the 2 sushi for $10 (spicy salmon roll and crispy sushi roll) and it was delicious.  It comes with soup and salad. Such a great deal!  It's decor and ambience leans to a nice restaurant you can take a date to.  The service is prompt and friendly and they offer 10% off cash orders over $25 (excluding lunch specials)  Definitely my go to spot!"}
{"text":"Went with my entire family for my birthday, the show was fun, however the quality of the food was mediocre, the chef kept tossing eggs, which is fun at first but when it was time to eat no one cleaned the raw eggs off our table and I was running around trying to get napkins to clean up myself, I think they can do much better, we paid $$$ for the entire group, I expect more."}
{"text":"Found myself in the area after a personal issue had arisen. I'd just got back from Portugal and Spain and there was no way I was eating Sushi in Europe with all the good local options there.   I had read up on this place and found it intriguing.   Positives:  Super friendly staff who are out to please. Great decor. This place has been recently updated and you can certainly tell - great furniture which has a higher end vibe to it.   The prices were also very reasonable. $18 for AYCE lunch.   Negatives:  Honestly, their sushi was too big. Jumbo rice with a huge piece of salmon. I like taking my time when I stuff my face and there was none of that here. My recommendation to the Management is that they reduce their portion size. They're blatantly trying to get you full fast.   A few of their other dishes were a miss (fried tofu), but quite frankly, the overall experience was good.   I can't give it a 4* because I just couldn't feel it but they're almost there.   Given that it's AYCE, they can afford to reduce portion sizes - but I do understand the increased work load."}
{"text":"This was the place where Honba used to be. I prefer Honba than Sushi Den. Too bad it closed down. This is not bad, but Ive had better."}
{"text":"From an Asian eating lots of AYCE, this restaurant doesn't worth 4* at all. Probably this can only fool local people. Rice has bad quality. No sashimi from lunch AYCE. Sushi is sliced horribly. The Hot and Sour soup is so sour that can't even take a second sip. The sushi roll is cut unevenly. Overall, very bad quality and the selection from lunch AYCE doesn't worth $14.99. Won't ever come back again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot to eat at in town. The don't leave you waiting, and they have such a good selection- along with nice staff."}
{"text":"I am glad to see Harry back with a new restaurant in Aurora. He started Sushi Kui off Yonge street several years ago. He was there for about seven years and the place was packed most of the time.  Like his previous place, the food is fresh, creative and well presented. His lunch menu also includes sashimi as part of the standard buffet. However, the buffet is only offered for lunch. This new location also has two Japanese style cooking \"areas.\" Essentially, there are two restaurants in one. You can order from an extensive Sushi menu or from a Japanese food menu where it is cooked in front of you.  My wife had food from the Japanese menu while I had sashimi. We were able to sit in the main part of the restaurant as we wanted more privacy. The food was fresh and quick and the staff were attentive. I also like the overall design and atmosphere of the restaurant. It has a modern feel - the kind you would expect in downtown Toronto.  If you are looking for good Japanese and Sushi, I highly recommend Sushi Den. I hope this review was hopeful.  We highly recommend Sushi Den."}
{"text":"Great food and good service! Went here for valentines day!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 had ayce sushi at this restaurant. I think this is one of the average ayce place considering that we've been to many ayce places in the past. It has the typical and basic sushi and rolls. Not much selection on cooked food. I would come back to try their teppanyaki menu though."}
{"text":"We had a great New Years Eve dinner!  I was very impressed by the attention to detail with my gluten allergy - several of the staff came and checked in numerous times to make sure certain ingredients were ok to include.  Service and food were fantastic, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were in Aurora for some teeth cleaning and after that was done, we opened up our yelp app to see what was around and lo and behold, an all you can eat sushi place was nearby.  The wife and I decided to give it a try and see how it goes.  When we arrived, we were promptly seated.  The decor of the restaurant was a bit outdated both exterior and interior wise.  The lights were very dim and gave off a somewhat romantic vibe.    We went straight to order our food and was given a sheet of paper and a pencil to make the order.  They didn't have those touch tablets you would find at most ayce sushi restaurants nowadays.  Their lunch menu selection wasn't that big but was enough to satisfy our  pallettes.  The service was good, the food came fast and fierce, and the taste and quality overall was alright too.  I would say it is comparable to any ayce sushi place you would find in Markham.  We would probably go back if we ever find ourselves in the Aurora neighborhood and were in the mood for some ayce sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Den Teppanyaki reiterated the expression, 'never judge a book by its cover.'  I don't know why, but I also found myself scrunching up my nose at the building every time I drove by it. Something about it just didn't seem right, alas, after a long day in Toronto for Comic Con 2016, my posse and I were both starved and tired and opted to eat closer to home as opposed to eating downtown, and so the great food debate concluded upon someone uttering: \"sushi?\" followed by, \"hey, what about that place on Wellington?\" I felt myself grimace, sure, I was curious... but how good could it be really, especially in that ghastly building?  When we pulled into the parking lot, I was stunned to find it was completely packed: this should have acted as my first sign that I was about to experience something good. When we finally managed to park the car on an angle (which I haven't experienced since I was in Florida) we we were surprised to enter the building to find a dimly lit, tastefully decorated sushi and teppanyaki restaurant: you have the option to pick either all you can eat, or teppanyaki. (Recommended to make reservations for teppanyaki, as seating is sparse.)   This was easily some of the best sushi I've had in the Aurora/Newmarket area in 3 years. Everything tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. The servers were attentive, and our glasses were never empty. My boyfriend's brother has a severe nut/soy product allergy and they readily had information on hand about what ingredients were used. (no nuts, yippie!)   As it was a nicer dining experience, and the food was really good, pricing was steeper than normal at a whopping $25.99 a person (which, I suppose isn't that far off from other all you can eat places) but I will gladly pay that money to go back again, and with it only being a short drive away from my house, you can definitely count on me coming back soon.

{"text":"I would like to preface this review by stating that it only covers the All You Can Eat Menu.  My son was all hyped up about going to a new sushi place so we went out of our way to try this one. His initial reaction was to walk right out when it was painfully obvious that his wheelchair was not going to get him close enough to the table to eat. I noticed some other tables in the Teppanyaki area of the restaurant and they allowed us to sit there to accommodate him. We filled out the ACE order sheet and about 10 minutes later the Hot and Sour soup came out. They should have called this Hot, Sour and Sweet soup as I noticed a tinge of sweetness that I am not used to in Hot and Sour soup. Then the sushi came out. As expected, great big balls of rice covered by sliver thin pieces of fish. This is pretty standard for ACE menus as they try to fill you up with cheap rice rather than expensive fish. These type of places though do not realize that there needs to be a balance between the rice and the fish and this place failed on an epic scale. This was especially true of the Hand Rolls: Far too much rice with a small amount of other ingredients. It was my son who picked up on the over sweetness of the sushi rice. Kyle has spent most of last year eliminating sugar from his diet. He dropped 20 pounds just on that one change. So when he is confronted with even the smallest amount of sweetness in a food, he will notice. Pad Thai and Green Curry of Chicken also displayed unusual sweetness to them. It appears that the chef has a love affair with sugar that needs to be corrected. Sugar is a POISON. All sugar, even the ones found naturally in fruits is a health risk with prolonged use. I have not cut it out to the extent my son has but even I could taste the sugar that was in nearly everything that was presented to us. It is our usual MO to go check out the ACE menu first and then try the A La Carte menu on a second visit. The amount of sugar in the food caused us both to feel drugged. Needless to say there will not be a second visit."}
