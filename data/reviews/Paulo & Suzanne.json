{"text":"meilleur putine de Montreal"}
{"text":"If you are craving diner food, Paulo & Suzanne is the place to go. I discovered this gem a couple of months ago and have since returned multiple times. The grilled hot dogs and poutine are my favorite. There is nothing like an all-dressed dog grilled to perfection. As for the poutine, you have an array of choices. I tried the chicken and onion poutine and it was bowl licking delicious. The only downside is regarding payment method; they only take cash and most of the time the ATM is not working. Bring your dollars and your experience here will be unforgettable."}
{"text":"Best place in town to have a Poutine , the Phillybomb is my favorite though I haven't tried the nacho one which looks really good on the menu. It's breakfast anytime of the day and staff is pretty efficient, friendly. The only downside is that they only accept cash so if you don't have any well you've gotta hit the ATM which charges a fee of course! Overall it's a nice place to hang out with a vintage look to it."}
{"text":"The best gravy ever!! The only problem i had was the meat they used didn't taste that good.. Kind of ruined the poutine for me personally but overall it was pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"The quantity of 13$ smoke meat poutine was pitiful. When we asked for more, we were told the quantity was set in advance."}
{"text":"Wonderful lady who spoke only French was very patient in conversing with me in English.  Food is typical bar/coffee shop items, but it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Great comfort food.  Staffs are friendly.  Place has the classic look which I really enjoyed.  Small place, but food was really good.  Big portion."}
{"text":"Diner style restaurant.  Small parking lot in the back.  Cash only.  Found this place on yelp.  Was not disappointed.  Out of towers looking for Poutine and couldn't be happier.  Philly cheese steak was on point.  Friendly staff, great service."}
{"text":"J'y ai mangé un repas hamburger steak comprenant soupe, dessert et café, le tout pour moins de 15$. Excellent repas et service rapide et attentif. Je recommande et j'y retourne."}
{"text":"I didn't like the outside look . But  I loved their chicken Burger. Chefs Angelo made it with care. Quality of the chicken was 4/5 , price is reasonable, service is good. MacDonald or subway charge the same for less of quality. I want to try the beef philly next. Go n try.."}
{"text":"Bar/Coffee shop type of food, but it tastes better then most.  I had some philly cheesesteak bomb and it was fantastic.  The waitress spoke only French and she was able to understand what I wanted and was very pleasant.  I am definitely returning to eat at this place."}
{"text":"It's 3 am, you sit down and ask, \"Do you serve breakfast at this time?\". The answer will always be \"yes of course\" followed with a smile. I usually get the stink eye from waitresses from other 24 hour joints whenever I ask that question in the middle of the night. No matter the time of day, you will always get great service at Paulo & Suzanne.  The menu is great, from the breakfast to the philly steak sandwich to the POUTINES. Ah yes, the poutines. I am a big fan of the BBO (Bacon/Beef/Onion) myself. If you do decide to pick up a poutine and love pepper sauce on it, ask to change the sauce on it. Paulo has hands down the best value for money poutines in Montreal and would probably rank in the top 5 overall on this island.  The ONLY flaw it has is that it's a CASH only establishment and their ATM isn't always functional.  I would gladly take great service and food over a functioning ATM. Anytime!  4.8/5"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese = Killer ! Un twist original sur un plat si simple. L'endroit idéal pour du comfort food."}
{"text":"I love this diner. Especially after a late night out. Whenever I go to Montreal, I go there to eat the Quebec staples: \"Steamy\" and \"Toasty\" Hot Dogs and of course poutine. *Drool*"}
{"text":"Paulo et Suzanne : LE meilleur spot a la sortie des bars.  Ok, c'est pas du tout dans le bout des bars Mais... Je vous jure que vous pouvez soudoyer le conducteur designé pour y aller en lui offrant un des choix suivants :  - Une assiette dejeuner pas possible - Une crepe au Nutella contenant au minimum un demi pot - Le Burger ultime avec bacon & pickle - Une poutine siiii bonne, soit originale ou avec saucisse et autres.   A cela, ajoutez un petit : jte juuuuure tu vas capoter !  Bon appétit !  ça y est, j'ai le ventre qui crie. JE VEUX DU P&S !"}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place since i was 12. Im now 26 and my opinion didnt change. Best. Poutine. In town! Its has that old school diner vibe, and the service is always good. In the summertime the terrace is almost always full but worth the wait. They have a little parking in the back of the diner. Doesnt disappoint."}
{"text":"So I came here because my brother told me they have the best poutine. I got the poutine with smoke meat. Was nothing special at all, smoked meat made it way too salty and unappetizing. Fries were nothing special and saugy... Would have rather went to la belle province or the julep for a 24 hr open resto that services poutine. Service was very slow at 1am and there were barely any people in the dinner. My BF absolutely hated it too. Even though I live minutes away, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Bon club. La poutine est immense, mais très bonne. Un incontournable comme resto lorsqu'on est dans le coin. Le service est toujours efficace et sympathique."}
{"text":"I've recently been back . and all i have to say is that this place get better .. they now have a breakfast poutine and their single size portions are fit for a king ... if you haven't been to Paulo & Suzanne .  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR !  GO .. JUST PUT DOWN THE DEVICE AND GO"}
{"text":"Open 24hr sdoesn't mean that quality will suffer. On the contrary, this establishment has been serving consistently excellent food for over 30 years! From breakfast to dinner, eggs benedict to steaks, you will find a wide choice of local comfort food you would expect from a Montreal diner. Although there are 8 different variations to choose from, I personally have a weakness for their classic Poutine. Definitely worth a stop if you're around the corner. Also a good time to say \"hi\" to the local law enforcement agents who regularly hang out there."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for business and legend has it that they have some kickass poutine in this neck of the woods so I sent out to try to find out if the legends were true.  I looked on Yelp to see if there was a place that was close to my hotel and stumbled on Paulo & Suzanne.  It's a cozy little diner in a fairly residential looking area.  Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak poutine on the recommendation of the waiter and I have to admit - I was pretty impressed.  It's certainly nothing like the poutine we get here in Vancouver, which is just fries with gravy slopped on top.  This was almost like a gravy and fries stew.  I enjoyed it and the one serving of poutine was enough to fill me up without ordering anything else.  Paulo & Suzanne's was a great introduction for me to real poutine and I have to say, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Les amateurs de restos \"diners\" style classique, avec des portions copieuses, banquettes rouges et places assises au comptoir, vous serez servis! Les \"must-try\" du menu: philly cheese sandwich (OMG!!!) et ... Toutes les poutines! Je n'ai pas encore fini d'essayer leurs spécialités, et je compte bien en tester plusieurs parce que tout est fait sur place, c'est bon, et c'est un plaisir coupable... En plus, c'est ouvert 24h!"}
{"text":"J'avais entendu parler de ce fameux casse-croute de Cartierville, mais je n'avais jamais été. Le choix de poutine y ait. Les sandwichs et gyros aussi. Vous pouvez commander tout type d'hamburger. Bref, un vrai casse-croute où on sent qu'on va sortir de là le ventre plein.  Quand je suis aller vers 21h du soir, un lundi, il y avait quand même beaucoup de monde. J'avais envie d'un hamburger, mais quand j'ai vu le menu de poutine, j'ai changé d'avis. J'ai pris la poutine jardinière. OMG QUE C'ÉTAIT DÉLICIEUX. UNE POUTINE DÉLICIEUSE FULL DE SAUCE AVEC PLEINNNNNN DE LÉGUMES (tsé pour me faire croire que j'ai fait un choix santé) et du gros poivre noir. Un bon délice. Et la poutine est immense. Comme si vous arrivez à manger cela one shot, chapeau. Ma soeur à pris celle avec guacamole, crème sûre et pico de gallo...hyper bonne. C'est sûre et certain que je vais y retourner.  Le temps d'attente est un peu long...mais on le voit car ce sont des produits frais.  AH OUI, LE RESTO EST OUVERT 24H!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's lowkey and it has the best poutine in town. Not very expensive and large portions."}
{"text":"A late night grub place on Gouin near the Sacré-Coeur Hospital, it's a great diner. They serve burgers, poutine, smoked meat with the works. I mean, it is not a life changing restaurant, but it is open 24h and the food is quite good. Everyone comes here, from cab drivers, people in the neighborhood and hospital workers included. When I'm stuck,starving, late night, in the west side, I usually end up at Paulo & Suzanne for a bite.  I usually order the Bacon, Beef, Onion poutine (BBO) or a poutine au poivre à l'ancienne, which comes with a pepper sauce. It hits a spot and it is enjoyably fattening.   The place is quite expensive for fast food tho, you have been warned. This is why it lost 1 star."}
{"text":"Best poutine hands down the regular one always hits the spot but if your in the mood for a little bit more, the Italian poutine with extra sauce is indescribably good. I wish I could make that meat sauce at home but they didn't want to share the secret.. Go figure but who can blame them. Been going there for years and I've never been disappointed. There's a great terrace in the summer. The food is served fresh and fast. The quantity and quality for what you pay is so worth it."}
{"text":"hands down the best poutine in the city! The staff is AMAZING! The owner is outgoing, warm, and gregarious! He engages everyone in such a positive way and everyone knows him by name!"}
{"text":"Just what you expect! My brother and I hyped up this places for weeks without actually going, On a random Saturday evening, we decided to actually go and test it out. Let's get more in details now.  Located in the Ahunstic-Cartierville, at the edge of St-Laurent, this small restaurant is easily missed. There is a parking right behind the restaurant. Another important is that they also take cash there. The environment inside the restaurant was really cozy, and the service was great.   The food itself is exactly what you expect: some good Quebecois food, which includes fries, hot-dogs, club sandwiches, poutine, etc. I went for the combo of 2 steamed hot-dogs and fries while my brother went for a poutine. I, unfortunately, did not have the chance to taste the poutine, but heard very good words from my brother. The steamers were actually good, exactly what you expect: soft bread with a sausage in the middle, with a set of condiments. The fries were also good with a generous portion.  Bottomline, would definitely come back if I am craving poutine or some junk food ;)"}
{"text":"Tried the smoked meat poutine and a grilled hot dog. This poutine was far more delicious for me and the grilled hot dog was just right.  I strongly recommend what I ordered and will be visiting again.  Service was great and the prices was affordable."}
{"text":"It's 3am, you've just finished partying, and your hungry...come here.  I've gone here many times with friends after a night out and I must say, it hits the spot.  The burgers are great and they come with a generous amount of tasty fries. If you'd like, go half fries and half Caesar salad to balance it up.  Service can be slow at times but that's how it is when it's packed. The prices are cheap considering the amount of food.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Solid poutine the hotdogs were good. The portions here are massive! The service was great. The place looks like an old diner and seemed very clean. The fact this place can put out a solid poutine at 4 a.m is a major plus! Great late night spot"}
{"text":"We were adventuring on Gouin Boulevard - an old road wrapping the top of the island that passes by a massive 19th century prison, sacre coeur hospital and waterfront parks, when we passed a bright casse-croute diner sign with the magical words \"24hrs.\" We pulled over for steamies and poutine, found a tiny 2 person booth and had food within minutes that was hot, huge, delicious, and inexpensive. Serving up satisfaction guaranteed for 30 years, the staff are cool, friendly, pros, seemlessly bilingual. Regular poutine was good, Italian poutine was great, steamies were perfect, and all the old people sitting around the counter were eating giant plates piled high with stuff I'm going to have to come back and try. Paolo and Suzanne are open 24hrs and serve breakfast all day ie; je t'aime."}
{"text":"Never lets me down, tons of options and open 24 hours. This place is a classic and will always be busy. I was born in the hospital across the street so this place is special to me. The consistency of the food and service is great. Hats off to the staff."}
{"text":"First of all I would have given this a 5 star. But the fact that the parking fits 4 cars in it really sucks and there parking on the street is so limited I have gotten so many tickets there. LOL but the foods fantastic  I have came here countless amount of times. Everything is good, there poutine sauce is different from the rest, there's a slight citrus note in the sauce it's phenomenal. The Paulo burger is also really good, it's a double cheeseburger it's massive... But my favourite thing here is the crepes with English cream.... These are the best crepes I have ever had period. And there English cream let's just say u can drink it and you wouldn't be embarrassed.  If ever in that area try this out its amazing, great service and friendly people."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Montréal, I always go here for the poutine.  In fact, that's all I've ordered as I would feel bad *not* ordering poutine.  The have your traditional poutine, and their variations are pretty simple too and nothing that was too froofy (ie: truffle shavings, vegetarian brown sauce, mix of four artisan cheeses).  That's pretty much all I feel qualified to say.  For in-town poutine, I love Paulo & Suzanne's."}
{"text":"This is a really typical place where Laval people and West Islanders of Montreal will go after a night at the bar. The heavy drinker requires some remedy before going to bed feeling like crap. Paulo&Suzanne is a snack bar opened 24/7. Really typical with the possibility to eat breakfast whenever the F*** you want! Now that's the spirit. Poutine, hot-dogs, Philly steak sub, Hamburgers everything's got fat in it and that's what going to help you get over that intense drinking that. You need to fight Fire with Fire.  The place is near Pont Lachapelle (well known by Lavalois), Hopital Sacré-Coeur, and the 68 busline which is one of the only bus that will bring you back in the WestIsland ( Roxboro, Pierrefond, DDO, Ile-Bizzard). A MUST when you need that little extra before-sleep snack."}
{"text":"After clubbing a group of friends and I decided to Munch on fast food but did not want the regular  \" Big mac \" . We found this small corner restaurant and decided to try it out after going over its reviews .  At first look , nothing very particular from the local 24 hr diner. Their menu was very well presented with everything you can think of : from pasta to pizza to burgers ....   Unfortunatelly some of my friends did not like their meal. Some had to send their burgers to the kitchen as the meat was not properlly coocked on the inside but mine was fine .  I took the \"Poutine Cheeseburger \"  The bill was about 15$ including soft drink"}
{"text":"Great place to get ur grease on! Or have a delicious breakfast at any given time. Small place,limited seating but fun & tasty!"}
{"text":"After a couple of takeouts and a satisfied stomach, I can say that Paulo & Suzanne knows how to make divine poutines. Let me tell what you should expect from this place: soft gnarly golden fries soaked in perfect gravy and semi-melting cheese curds. On top of that, if you opt for it, most vegetables topping your poutine should be soft and nicely caramelized. If you want to indulge yourself then you should try their burger in a poutine doused in Southwest sauce combo (I forgot the name of the dish.) It tastes better than it sounds even though it does sound convincingly delicious.   You have artery problems? No worries, the Hôpital du Sacré-Cur de Montréal is right across the street to fix you up and to prepare for your next visit to P&S.  One of the great things about this place is that they're open 24/7. Instead of hitting McDonald's after a night out with friends, why not impress them with Paulo & Suzanne?"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast. My bf and I come here at least 1 a week. Everything on the menu is AMAZYing! The people, the waitress and food is what makes us a regular customer!! I really recommend the breakfast and poutine!! Yummmm :)"}
{"text":"Tout simplement la meilleure poutine à Montréal. Ceux qui vont dire le contraire sans y avoir goûté sont des hérétiques. Depuis que j'ai découvert leurs poutines à la sauce aux poivres, je n'ose même plus revenir à la traditionnelle. Le casse croûte a l'air de rien comme ça, mais il en vaut le détour."}
{"text":"En arrivant, j'ai tout de suite remarqué l'affiche avec la petite photo de France d'Amour qui dit que c'est la meilleure poutine en ville. Ça m'a fait sourire! Les poutines sont ÉNORMES! J'en ai eu assez pour 3 repas! Tous les ingrédients sont exactement comme il le faut pour une bonne poutine et bien qu'elle était très bonne, il n'y avait rien d'extra pour que je l'aime un peu plus que d'autres. Peut-être que si j'y avais été à 3 heures du matin au lieu d'y être à l'heure du souper je l'aurais mieux appréciée?"}
{"text":"Better than Decarie Hotdog's poutine.  Peppery sauce, crispy fries, lots of toppings (meats, cheese curds), and decent portion.  As for seating, there is a terrace and indoor seating. You order at a small counter and can wait at the tables on the terrace.  Only thing though, is that one of the cooks seems somewhat racist (either that or he has a bad sense of humour). He was telling me that their biggest poutine was for chinese kids, because apparently chinese kids need to eat more to grow bigger."}
{"text":"One of the best places near Laval to go to! Open 24 hours so it's great for after clubs-bars if you need to go back to Laval from Montreal, not really far. The must: Roue 66. Every poutine is unique and different but Roue 66 is my fav. They have generous portions and most of the time I don't finish it all. Make sure to have cash since they don't take cards."}
{"text":"For those 2 am cravings, this place never fails. Everything on the menu is amazing! The grilled cheese with spicy cheetos inside is just ridiculous, the poutines are all very good and the subs are mouthwatering."}
{"text":"Très bonne Poutine ! Et ouvert 24h quoi de mieux pour une fringale en tout temps. Je le recommande !"}
{"text":"Its CASH ONLY so make sure to bring some with you or use the ATM there.  This is my first time in Montreal and I saw the reviews so I had to try it.  Service:   My French is almost non-existent but I at least try and the waitress was so nice to me in speaking English and even taught me some good French phrases! I would definitely come back again!  Food:  We got the crepe supreme and it was HUGE and TASTY. Some crepes can be  gummy or too dense but this one was perfect.  The texture was fluffy with substance,  the fruit was plentiful and fresh,  the nutella was not too much and the creme anglaise was light and had just the right amount of sweetness.  I even had enough to bring some home.  Oh, and they use real whipped cream in the hot chocolate.  Definitely a plus."}
