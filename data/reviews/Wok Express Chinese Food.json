{"text":"I've been coking here since I was a very little kid with my parents and its something we still look forward to. The service is quick and amazing the man would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. And the food don't get me started on the food. Just come and check it out your self I promise it wont disappoint."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. The staff is friendly. Just basic chinese food."}
{"text":"Good and fast Chinese food at a reasonable price.

There aren't that many options for a quick and cheap lunch in this area, but this one satisfies both needs for right around $5.  It isn't absolutely amazing and the lunch portion sizes aren't near as much as a lot of the cheap Chinese places are, but do you really need a to-go box at lunch?

I took a friend and we got the sesame chicken and the general's chicken.  It comes with rice and an egg roll.  Both entrees had a decent fried crunchy texture and a note of fruit.  The sauces were a little thinner than most places but I don't mind not being dowsed with a ridiculous amount of cornstarch.

If in the area and not trying to deal with nuances of Piscies \"all you can eat\" sushi lunch special I will be back.

FYI, take a look at the pic that had been submitted if you want an idea of portion size."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20 years. The owner is the original, he is an amazing guy and truly cares about his business and customers. Service is quick at lunch, expect ?eating to fill up quickly. 

I'm not much on standard Chinese fare like General Tso's or Sesame Chicken  but with the amount I see going out it must be pretty good. The egg rolls are great, well done like I like them. The won ton soup and hot and sour are standard fare, solid dishes overall. Crab Rangoons are quite good as well.  One of my favorites is the curry chicken, have him add vegetables for a real treat and get it with steamed rice to temper the heat. Not a huge fan of the fried rice here, a bit heavy on the soy. In the winter try an off menu favorite, chicken and vegetable soup. White meat chicken with standard vegetables, bok choy and bean sprouts in a won ton broth. Satisfying yet light. 

Portion sizes are good especially for lunch and prices are low especially this close to Midtown. Certainly a worthy establishment that appears to be overlooked by other more trendy Asian themed locations nearby."}
{"text":"I never eat Chicken wings at a Chinese restaurant but thay have the BEST I have ever eaten!! Super Yummy!! I also recommend the crab ragon! Great food and Prices!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.  

The one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth."}
{"text":"This place is everything that you expect from the name, and it does not disappoint. My girlfriend and I dropped by around 2:30p after school. A couple customers were eating in the comfortable, quaint booths, and it was pretty chill. On our way in, as we were deliberating with a menu, one gentleman even said \"The food is good, you'll like it here.\"

I can't really say that the food was amazing, because it was fairly standard Chinese takeout fare. That said, I couldn't have asked for it to be better without asking for it to be something completely different. I enjoyed my sesame chicken, fried rice, egg roll, and crab rangoons.

I think this is a husband and wife operation, and the quality of service really sets this restaurant apart. After eating a crab rangoon and egg roll, I moved to grab my fork and clumsily dropped it on the floor. I got up and walked to the counter, and by the time I got there the gentleman was holding a fork out to me and was ready to take the dirty one back. He was both paying attention, and he cared. It would have been very easy for him to ignore me, or simply to have not been courteous. Definitely a sign of A+ service."}
