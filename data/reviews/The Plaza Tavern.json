{"text":"Yeah, yeah. The burger is good and something to go see, if you're a tourist. 

But once you become familiar with the Plaza you realize what its real beauty is. 

This is hands down the best drinker's bar in town. If you haven't visited here and raged it with the regulars, you haven't truly been to Madison. 

The bartenders pour free drinks if you are extra \"nice\" or amuse them. Hell, they'll even take a shot with you (or 4). 

I knew an employee there who would take bets with customers over whether they could outchug him. I never saw him lose. 

The food is basic and delicious, the bar staff and waitresses have, um, personality, and the owner is ridiculous. 

Plenty of attitude and cheap booze make this one of the few places in town you can spend all night. Just don't ask for a margherita. Or piss off the bouncer."}
{"text":"Everyone gushes about the food.  How hard is it to deep fry a potato? I think the history of it is more impressive.  There are not many places that have endured."}
{"text":"I will never forget this place because it was here, at the Plaza, that I took my first conscious bite of a fried cheese curd.

A dive for sure. I don't remember this bar having the most character but it's nice because you can drop by in the late afternoon, perhaps in jeans and a wife beater with no makeup, and eat greasy food and cheap alcohol and not have to worry about a darn anything . . . except the calories you are consuming. 

Because I lived about a block away, I'd stop here out of convenience. I had a great time playing pool here on a few random occasions."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand why people like the Plaza Tavern?! It looks like a guetto, trashy, rundowned bar, and it doesn't seem the owner cares too much about the business at all!! Plaza Tavern isn't real competitive with the other bars downtown, they have no lines Friday, and Saturday nights, except for Thursday night, but who cares, that's not a weekend night!!!! 

As far as entertainment, they have no live music, no bands, they don't provide what most college kids want!! I honestly don't know why people like going , it's just really boring, a dive!!!!!"}
{"text":"Drink when you're thirsty. Eat when you're hungry. Sleep when you're tired. And when you want to walk - stroll. These are the primary tenets of mountain time. It should not be confused with Mountain Time - the time zone 2 hours behind New York  - that guides residents of the Rocky Mountains. No, no, this is something far different. 

This version of mountain time isn't kept track of on your iPhone. It exists in your soul. Ticking away each second until you're ready to meet your maker. There are no heroes in mountain time. No clocks. No capes. Extremes thrive here. Your ascent begins at daybreak and ends at nightfall. 

I once climbed the mountain at the Plaza. With a local buddy who goes by Bart - son of JR, father of Cock - we had a few pitchers ate burgers and sang late into the darkness. I'm not from Wisconsin. But I could be. We all could be. If you don't believe me, try the Plaza."}
{"text":"Okay, its an institution...the burgers are okay, the clientele more authentic, but what the hell, you got someplace better to go?  Didn't think so, have a Miller and shut up.  Oh, sorry, fell into character there, just go and have a burger and beer, you'll be happy.  If not, its no skin off my...  Oops, there I go again, see what this place does to you?!"}
{"text":"Plaza is synonymous with Dive.

That said, this is a place where everyone is welcome.  There's no pretentiousness.  Come dressed up.  Come in pajamas.  It doesn't matter.  The clientele is so diverse you're never bored crowd watching here.  The decor is back-woods garish with dark paneled walls and giant pictures of deer in the woods.  The vinyl booths are ripped and the tables in the back belong in the dump.  I don't think anything in this place has changed in the last 30 years.

Despite the fact that every time you leave here you feel incredibly dirty (and incredibly inebriated), you have to love the Plaza.  Why?  Because everyone needs a favorite dive bar."}
{"text":"$2 Long Islands last night. That makes for $4 doubles. Fun was had by all."}
{"text":"A no frills Wisconsin establishment at its finest.  I'm a fan... the booze is cheap and the food is good.  

The place really gets kickin' later at night on the weekends with a fairly diverse mix of people.  They've got a jukebox that I somehow always manage to pump with some 1970s Rod Stewart gems...SOMEBODY'S got to get that crowd MOVIN

I've been here more than a handful of times and have never left unfulfilled."}
{"text":"A State Street classic you can support just by eating Plazaburgers.  We take the kids for dinner once in a while and plazaburgers are always a favorite.  They are not the huge burgers that are all-bread that some places serve.  The secret sauce is awesome, the buns are a nice soft whole-wheat, and the burgers are always cut in half.  With dimmed lights and an atmosphere that hasn't changed for decades (booths with chrome coat racks, huge \"up North\" murals, old-fashioned beer signs), the Plaza is a place we return to once a month, at least.  Great, friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"Diver.  All they need is a ping pong table and would be 5.  Kinda sketchy though."}
{"text":"It takes one bite. Only one. The Plazaburger at the Plaza is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Its not because of the bun or the patty. It's because of the secret sauce that oozes through the beef. It's incredible. There isn't another burger like it. By no means am I a burger expert, but I've eaten my share. I know in my heart that this burger can stand up to any burger that takes it on. It's that good"}
{"text":"It is hard to find a dive bar in Madison that isn't full of sweaty freshman taking ownership over the shuffleboard table. The plaza guarantees at least one game to play and cheap drinks along with the best neighborhood sconnies in the city. Don't miss this place if you are looking to shoot some quarter pool or pinball."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Madison.  You can't have a bad time here.  Unless the surly bartenders are yelling at you, but that's simply to be considered part of the experience.  I love you, Plaza."}
{"text":"Stop by American Apparel, pop on your high-waisted short shorts and let's get our hip groove on to a jukebox playlist. Now, our chosen jukebox dollar ditties probably won't play until tomorrow's bar crowd comes through but no biggie, this \"Wonderwall\" request will do. Limbo under the pool stick as that guy goes to break and your next long island's on me, girl.

The place isn't fancy by any means but it's a college kid favorite, which means people-watching is prime on a Thursday when the long islands are only $2. Education is expensive, amiright? And when you're trying to keep up with the youngsters as they down their drinks, treat yourself to a Plazaburger and be thankful you did. This cheesy, greasy goodness, as truthfully described on The Plaza's homepage, \"is sopped with secret sauce and delicious.\" S-o-p-p-e-d. Ain't nothin' wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty cool. it is kind of off of state street so it is kind of a hidden gem. It has a really cool atmosphere with a jukebox, some video games, dart boards, and a pool table. They have a really nice front area an a pretty big bar. It has great accent lighting along the walls right next to the booths and such. Yeah it has a little bit of the dive-y feel to it but this place makes it work somehow. I generally don't like dive bars but this one has a great feel to it that makes ya feel like a regular right away. The bartenders are really nice and extremely attentive! They also have cheap drinks and great specials!"}
{"text":"The Plaza Burger is a Madison institution that should not be missed. Plaza sauce is sorta ranchy and makes the burger pleasantly moist, eliminating the need for ketchup and mustard. I suggest ordering a side of deep fried mushrooms (with a side (side side?) of plaza sauce for dipping with the burger. Also the beer here is good and very reasonably priced. A great, laid back place just off State that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I feel like the plaza tavern has been in Madison for a really long time. I would consider it more like a dive bar. They do have 2 pool tables and a giant screen where you can watch tv or a game. They also have a couple of arcade games. I did not try any of the food but we did go in to try their Thursday drink special which is $3 Long Islands. They were good for the price you pay and they only take cash so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"The classic Plaza Tavern.....never fails. I've been coming here since I was a kid.   A true gem in Madison.  You can't the cheap beer and delicious burgers."}
{"text":"\"Ahhhh, the memories. When I think of Madison, one of the first images that comes to mind is this rustic, downhome, northwoods bar which was THE favorite Madison hangout for a very large social network that included a great many of my friends and acquaintences. From the vinyl booths lining the walls, to the backroom pool table and dart game machines, to the bartenders in full white traditional barkeep shmatas behind the counter, there was no pretention here. This old haunt was the essence of my Madison experience. They also served up the best bar food I've had, especially the classic Plazaburger dressed with the famous Plaza Sauce. And you couldn't beat it for the price either: burger, $2.80, fries 65 cents, grilled cheese, $1.75. Even the prices are from another time and place....\""}
{"text":"The plaza burger is sooooo good. I visited Madison for work, I stayed downtown and was told to get a Plaza burger. It did not disappoint. Well done Madison, well done!!! Oh and I like my burgers medium rare. Sooo good."}
{"text":"The Plaza Burger is amazing! We were seated right away and the service was great. Make sure to put the Plaza sauce over everything on your plate! Also, there are some great TVs to watch all your Wisconsin sports events."}
{"text":"Great nostalgia at this joint. Still looks the same as it did when I was seeking in here underage in 1997. Although, a lot less smokey now. I'm sure it looks the same as it did in 1977. Favorite parts: the artwork, the Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga machine, bubble hockey, the booths, and the Plazaburger. 

About the Plazaburger: it is currently $5.25. It is the same size as a McDonald's hamburger and pretty much the same quality. However, it is actually cooked and not microwaved. I guess that makes it worth another $1.50 over the $1 menu burger. It also has the great \"special\" sauce, which is delicious! Maybe that is worth another $0.50. That brings it to about $3. My point is...you should get almost two (or at least a double) at that $5.25. Way too pricey, but it is a Madison fav and Johnny Cash and Bill Murray have been here before, so...."}
{"text":"Look. Contrary to every hipster in Madison's opinion, the Plaza isn't actually the best fucking bar on the face of the earth. It isn't even the best bar in Madison. I've drank here on many different occasions, and I don't honestly think there's much that sets this apart from any other good bar. That being said, it is a good bar. 

Downtown Madison is swarming with obnoxious frat boys and wasted 19-year-olds on any given Friday or Saturday night. Almost all the campus bars are so loud you have to scream to have a conversation, and are so dark you can't see two feet in front of you. Perfect if you're looking to get felt up by weird and desperate strangers, not so much if you're not into that.  But if you come here, you get a lot less of that. 

It's not a dive bar by any means. Not even close. You still run into large crowds and you may have to wait in a line, though it will move a lot faster than the line outside the Church Key or the KK. There's several pool tables, and surprisingly, you can actually get one on a busy night in a reasonable amount of time, and even have the elbow room to move your cue around. 

The drink specials are nothing to brag about. Cheap, but just as cheap as anywhere else in town. But the Plaza really steps it up for bar food. Not only does it taste great, but it's also unbelievably cheap. Burgers and other sandwiches are around only $4 each, side dishes average about $2. 

The burgers kind of remind me of the burgers you'd get at McDonald's, but hey, McDonald's didn't get rich off of selling burgers that don't taste good. Like McDonald's, the burger is a thin, greasy patty inside a sweet-tasting bun. My guess is that it's honey wheat, and it goes well with the burger. I highly recommend the plazaburger. It's covered in a signature sauce that strongly resembles tzatziki. They'll also put any toppings you want for free. Order more than one, they're small.

The Plaza also serves some of the best french fries you'll ever get at a bar. But the \"large\" order of fries was literally just enough to fill a small saucer. Their coleslaw is good stuff too. Really sweet, though it's unfortunately a little soggy because they don't bother to make it to order.

So if you come in to the Plaza believing all the hype (and there's a ton), you're probably going to be disappointed. This isn't the best bar ever. But the food alone makes it worth coming back. Not a bad place to come drink if you want the comfort of a big college bar without all the headache of your typical loud, overcrowded campus watering hole."}
{"text":"Thursday night $2 long islands. Very busy. Pretty hipster, but fun! Get there before 10:30 unless you want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Oh, the Plaza.  Where to start?  I spent many a nights here in college and after.

Best fries ever.  Burgers rock.  Awesome beer choices, great drinks, kickin atmosphere, rockin bartenders.  Jukebox rocks.  Cheap!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger, good potato salad, fast, friendly service and the perfect atmosphere for someone visiting Madison for the first time and wanting something that feels authentic and real. And, sososo cheap! My meal plus a pint of pbr was less than $11!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap food, full bar with top shelf stuff, and both inexpensive domestics and great German beer. It's a great place to hand with the old decor, pool tables, and darts. Been going there since 1988."}
{"text":"I first heard of this place in a pub in Minneapolis' Dinkytown. They had a tribute to the Plaza Burger. Good, but not great.  So... 20 years later, I stopped in with a friend and sampled the original. Five years later and I never come to Madison without stopping here."}
{"text":"Historic, classic, Madison staple - the Plaza is great. The inside is from another time, but that's how we like it. Have been going here for years but recently went twice after a few years away. The people working here are so nice and offer really good service. Love the atmosphere and how it really makes you feel like you went back in time. But mostly we went for a Plaza Burger. I remembered them being good - but WOW they are so yummy. I really could eat two easily so get it with fries or plan to fill up on drinks. So unique though and so tasty. The bar can get busy depending on when you go - but its worth it and always fun."}
{"text":"The original hip bar that never tries to be hip. This place has cool decor (it looks like a '70s bowling alley in there) but the crowd can range from really cool to downright obnoxious. If you get a chance, go try their signature Plaza Burger that's steeped in legend. Not all that special, but then you have bragging rights to it once you try it."}
{"text":"The Plaza is a great, dimly lit dive bar that hasn't changed its decor since the 1970s, and that is part of the reason it is so wonderful.

All of the food is extremely reasonably priced, and you get exactly what you order, no frills; straight up bar food.

The Plaza Burger is great, a simple burger with their awesome Plaza sauce.

The atmosphere at the Plaza is ideal, from its employees to the crowds who hang out there both day and night.

In all, its retro charm and simplicity make this dive bar a winner."}
{"text":"If you know what it and set your expectations accordingly you will enjoy yourself. This is a dive bar, with a concrete floor from the 70's. It looks like a bar you would more likely find in Northern Wisconsin than Madison. A healthy mix of good natured college students and locals. 

Generally everyone there is without attitude and is there to have a good time. Wont impress you with its aesthetics, but low priced drinks add to the allure. A good place to drink without worries."}
{"text":"To those fellow reviewers who mentioned the Plaza Tavern feels like a bar out of a movie where they know your name and drink, you are spot on. I left this place feeling like a character from the movie \"Going The Distance.\" It just has the nostalgic feel to it. The Plaza Burger is good, the This place feels like a small town bar where everybody knows everybody. One thing that disappointed me was they are not open on Sundays. Overall I would recommend going there for the Plaza Burger and cheese curds."}
{"text":"The Plaza isn't just my favorite bar in Madison, it's my favorite bar ever. It was the first bar I went to legally, and since leaving Madison, I've struggled to find a bar that can compete with the Plaza in terms of amazingness. It's been a really tough struggle, no joke. The Plaza is pretty big, which is always good, especially since the Plaza tends to be pretty popular. The jukebox is pretty sweet, although they changed it between when I lived in Madison and when I went back to visit. The drinks are pretty reasonably priced, and sometimes they're really shitty (the Long Islands are, frankly, awful, but when they're $2 who cares?), but not always. They will, however, ALWAYS get you drunk. And isn't that the point?

Everyone comments on the decor. It's old. It's bad. The only place that can out Sconnie it is the Caribou. It looks like your uncle's finished basement circa 1973, but without the pea soup colored shag carpeting. And that's all the charm. Combined with the fact that literally every type of person hangs out there, the Plaza has an ambience unlike anywhere else in Madison. If I could only go to one bar for the rest of my life, I would absolutely choose it to be the Plaza"}
{"text":"About as close to a 'real Wisconsin' joint as one may find downtown. Mostly full of locals after a long day of work. 

Beer is a little on the pricey side, $4.50 in a dive bar feels like a buck too much, but it was a nice draft of Spotted Cow. Their big attraction, the 'Plaza Burger' is a fairly priced frozen patty cooked--but unfortunately not seared--and dowsed in a strange concoction of sour cream and mayo. If you ask me it's just a package of French Onion dip with some extra seasoning. I wouldn't say I loved it but I can say that I ate everything on my plate. There are better burgers abounding within a 10 minute walk.

Worth a stop through for out of town-ers, and those looking for a chill place to avoid undergrads downtown while unwinding with a burger and a draft."}
{"text":"I have no comments about their food, as i've never had it.  But I will give a handy bit of advice.  If you're looking for a place to go out on a Thursday, this is the place to be.  You might have to wait in line for a little while, but once you get in, it'll be grand.  It has good drink specials, fun staff, a lively atmosphere (Personally, I always see a lot of people I know there), and some classic activities like darts, pool, table hockey, and arcade games.  It's a blast!

On any other day, it isn't nearly as exciting.  Barely anyone there, and the drink specials aren't as nice.  If you want a more calm place on a weekend, then the Plaza might be your niche, but there's better places for that purpose.

Plaza is a 2 on a normal day of the week, but it'd be a 5 if every day were a Thursday, but sadly only 1 day is.  So i'm giving it a 3."}
{"text":"A dive is great except when it is overrun by douchebags..which happens to this bar on the weekends. Otherwise it's great to hang out with friends at during the week to play pool, have a burger and shoot the shit. There is waiter service on these nights as well. On Thursdays, skip those $3 Long Islands unless you have a tongue that no longer tastes."}
{"text":"If Donald Trump ever made his way to The Plaza Tavern there's no way he wouldn't call it a sh*thole.  Don't get me wrong, I like a dive bar just as much as anybody else, but I struggled to find any redeeming qualities to make this worth while. 

For starters I let the whole \"cash only\" thing slide since that is quintessential to the dive bar experience or the staff who where on their cell phones the whole time.   That's all fine.   What's not fine is the value.  Dive bars are suppose to be cheap and offer good wholesome food.  You aren't supposed to feel ripped off at a dive bar, which is exactly how I felt after leaving. 

I was actually looking forward to Plaza Tavern given it's institution status.      I rarely carry cash on me, but today I had a crisp ten dollar bill ready to for my plaza burger.  I should have kept my cash for the tolls....

The plaza burger was a very anemic burger on a drink coaster of a bun.  The \"famous\" plaza sauce reminded me of spackle mixed with ranch and mayonnaise.  Worst off was that the burger ended up costing me 5.25 not including tip.  Somehow this donkey sauce knockoff is suppose to be worth a 50 cent up charge.  Fine, you're not here for plaza sauce you're at a dive bar to get effed up right.  The pints were 3 bucks, hardley a unique deal given what a dump this place was. 

Do yourself a favor.  If you want a dive bar experience you'd be better off sitting in your office storage closet with bag of culver's and a six pack of spotted cow...."}
{"text":"One of the best dive bars in town, if not the best. The burger/curds/secret sauce combo is the most delicious dish served in the state. Guaranteed. 

Cash only establishment and on Thursdays they have a $2 (might be $2.50 now) deal on long islands. They finally changed out the figurines in the bubble hockey game so any cons I could think of are fixed now! 

It has a northwoods feel in the middle of the big city. Great place."}
{"text":"This place is a Madison classic!  They are famous for burgers and their signature \"Plaza Sauce\".  Just over from State Street, down from the Capitol of Wisconsin.  Great service and a great bar burger.  There is parking just outside if you are lucky, if not, there are parking garages nearby."}
{"text":"If you have never been here, go at least once. Get the Plaza Burger, first invented here in 1964. Suck in the dive bar prices and atmosphere. Revel in the fact that tens of thousands have shared this same experience, including Johnny Cash and Bill Murray. Appreciate this used to be an old bowling ally, and the first woman to ever bowl a 300 game did so right here in 1930. Notice the smoke damaged paintings on the wall may be that old.

Good staff, great nightlife, and I know two married couples who met here during college. It's a Madison institution."}
{"text":"Gotta love the 'Za.  It's like an up north dive bar in the heart of Madison.  :)  It has ugly old paintings on the wood-paneled walls, uncomfortable non-matching chairs, cracked floor tiling, horrendous bathrooms, and a deer hunting arcade game.  And it's fabulous.

They have cheap pitchers, good drink specials and great cheese curds (the Plaza Burger is also supposed to be delicious, but I've never tried it--blasphemy, I know).  This place introduced me to Catdaddy Moonshine, which the waitress described as tasting \"like Christmas.\"  She meant that it tastes like eggnog, and boy, was she ever right.  If I remember the Plaza for anything, it will be for introducing me to this amazing, highly-alcoholic and wonderfully tasty liquor!

Anecdotally, one time a group of us were sitting at one of the booths, drinking our weight in liquor.   The group of bartenders toasted our deep pockets by heralding us from the bar and doing a shot with us in our honor.  Nice.

I don't like this place later at night.  By 11 or 12 Thursday-Saturday, it randomly becomes filled with douchebags.  Where did they come from?!  Before then, though, it's excellent."}
{"text":"MMMMMMM...Plaza burgers.  Shakes.  Beer.  Memories.  I miss it!"}
{"text":"This is a divey type bar and if that's what you are into, it is pretty cool to go with a group a friends. However my experiences with staff and customers alike is that they aren't very friendly and every kinda keeps to themselves as much as they can. Kinda takes away from the fun of a bar if you ask me. As for the food, it is typical greasy bar food. Nothing very stand out in my opinion. This bar is cash only, so come prepared and bring enough to tip your bartender and waitress!"}
{"text":"The Plazaburger. It's their thing.

No, the patties aren't grass-fed massaged Kobe beef hand formed or anything like that... it's all about the sauce with this here monster.

That sauce is the stuff I'm sure lots of Madison legend is made of.

It's some sort of aioli ranch dill-onaise hybrid, and this sauce? The biz nasty, folks.

The Plaza Tavern boasts a bar food menu replete with items for you to dunk in that storied sauce.

Cheap drinks, a dive-y feel, Big Buck Hunter/other assorted video games, one of the most random genre-spanning playlists I've encountered in awhile, and really friendly bartenders. Giant-ass paintings of landscapes adorn wood-paneled walls. A back room with a pool table, beer neons, and well... you get the idea.

Were this spot in MKE I'd definitely hit it up for some curds and a few beers every now and again!

Cash only; there's ATM on site, however."}
{"text":"Plaza burger was really good. The service was absolutely horrible. She gave us our bill right away before asking us if we wanted anything else. She was very short with us and was not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Large retro dive-y place with very friendly staff. Thanks for the recommendation of the amber beer on draft! It was great!"}
{"text":"College indie crowd.  Good music.  Love the thursday night cheap Optimator... delicious.  Gave it a three cuz it's often too packed and kinda has a dingy feel to it."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love The Plaza. You can catch me here almost every Thursday night for the $2.50 Long Island ice teas playing a game of pool in the back room. There's definitely a hipster crowd that likes to congregate here on Thursdays; it's a more relaxed alternative to the state street bars. 

The bartenders are all gems. 

Thursday nights pull a crowd and you may end up waiting outside for 20 minutes if you come around 10:30pm. Any other night is basically dead. I hear the plaza burger is really good, but I have yet to try it because they close the kitchen before I usually get there."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get.  The Plaza is basically unchanged since I have been coming here in the early '90s (other than the juke box being replaced by a touchtunes...).  College kids, regulars, tourists-I like that it can feel home for anyone that steps inside.  It's not flashy but I wouldn't call it a dive bar as some reviewers have in the past).  It is a simple Wisconsin tavern that happens to be located downtown Madison.  The plaza burger is an institution and while it may seem pedestrian in the times of crazy burger creations, it still brings back memories.  The Plaza doesn't try to hard and it doesn't need to.  It's real.  It's authentic.  And while they still only take cash, I can put that aside as I slide into one of the booths and reminiscence about the time that I have spent there living in Madison."}
{"text":"Greatest bar in Madison. 

Great drink specials. Great drinks. Great food. Cheese curds and the Plaza burger are so good. The long islands will do the trick (especially on Thursdays when they're $2.00). The juke box is awesome and the bar  draws a great crowd. Only con is it's cash only.

Love the Plaza."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bar with good specials and that solid old neighborhood bar feel, Plaza's your place. Cheap drinks every night of the week, plenty of TVs, pool, lots of seating. This place has everything a classic bar should have, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else - which is why I love it. Higher end bars aren't always a bad thing, but whenever you want to ditch the fancy drinks and get some good bar food instead, Plaza's here for you.

Oh and DAT BURGER. Pretty sure most of the world's problems would be solved if everyone just ate a Plaza burger with cheese curds and some Plaza sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Okay wtf. I asked for water and they gave me pickle juice. 
Just kidding. 
Great people great service, but the pin ball machines are freaking rigged.
The sauce was the baus!. Pickle juice on fleek.

Darby was nice Katya was so/so. Jk great service from both."}
{"text":"Let's just say it has a reputation for putting roofies/date-rape drugs in women's drinks, so please, please, please use caution and make sure your friends are looking out for you when you hang out at this bar."}
{"text":"My dad used to take me here as a kid when I did good on my report card or something for a Plaza burger. He used to drink here in the early 80s when he lived in Madison. 

Things haven't changed much, and the Plaza burger is still just as amazing now that I grew up. Not too big so as to make you feel disgusting afterwards (like Five Guys). The sauce is incredible. I wish I could buy it in bulk. Get the fries too. Simple, but an excellent addition. 

Got to love the hockey arcade game (Wisconsin vs. Minnesota) and the awesome murals. The legend is that a patron ran up a bar tab he couldn't pay and painted the murals to settle up. 

All in all the Plaza is an institution and the $2 long islands on Thursday are just an added bonus. If you want real Madison, this is it."}
{"text":"Thursday night is the only night I have ever and will ever go to Le Plaz. 

$2 Long Islands and $2.50 select craft beers on rotation (Hoppalicious, Bedlam, etc.). Play table hockey for $1 and gloat over your friends all night! Winning is temporary, bragging is forever.

Visit the Plaza for a trip to the past. If you find yourself feeling like you're in a bad 70's disco dream (velvet paintings included)... don't worry, you're not dreaming."}
{"text":"In town and visiting U of W and after a nice dinner at Graze, my kids and I walked into this college town bar and soaked in the atmosphere.   Kids were on spring break so yes, it was quiet.  Played Cricket Darts.  Tastes some local beers and had small talk with some locals.  I can imagine how fun this bar is during the school year."}
{"text":"This place is everything I want in a local Tavern. Cheap stiff drinks, ice cold Budweiser, awesome bartenders (Erica is really cool) who know what you drink, solid jukebox, games, and surprisingly good bar food. It seems like everyone is a regular here and they are really friendly, even to new people. Plus, it's a Madison classic and a must try. Plaza sauce should go on everything! Dean the owner is a bad ass, FYI. Great spot to watch a Badger game if you can't get tickets."}
{"text":"Thursday night $5 double long islands. Let me say that again, Thursday night $5 double long islands. Let me sing it again (Sisqo voice), Thursday night $5 double long islands.

Have one, maybe two. Probably three. Plus this place is cool looking as all hell. Try to get in there before 10pm because the undergrads will show up en masse. The space inside is large enough to accommodate all, but you don't want to wait in line if you can help it."}
{"text":"I agree with the fellow Yelpers, The Plaza is an excellent drink venue. I loved the service as well. As soon as I sat down at a table with my friends in the \"back end\" section, the waitress came to take order. 1 min later, my delicious rum&coke came, 3 more min later, hot, right-out-of-fryer onion ring came. Both my stomach and I appreciated the quickness so much.

The pretty spacious back room has 2 darts machines. My friends and I had good time chatting, drinking, and playing darts.  

This place will be on my \"to go back\" list."}
{"text":"I love the Plaza. Great specials and awesome food! Environment is more relaxed and it's nice to get away from the bro bars on University and the crowds on State St."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Madison to get shit-faced. Sometimes you'll need to toss a few undergrads out of the way to get a drink - no big deal."}
{"text":"For my 100th yelp review I want to take a nostalgic stroll into my past.  I haven't been back to Madison in 20 years since I graduated, and my parents moved away.  I spent ages 5-22 living in Madison, and it's a lovely town.  I sometimes wonder how I can get back there, except I'll probably end up elsewhere, like Santa Fe or Newmarket New Hampshire or somewhere in Europe or India.

Anywho, I started going here when I was 16.  I was carded on my 19 birthday, which was ironically the first time I was legal.  

Do they still have the cool landscape paintings?  Do they still have the Lucky Strike pinball games?  Do they still have Plaza Burgers, which I tried when I was in Rochester MN, and realized that the Plaza served burgers.  Does the same family still run the place?

Fond memories of a gentleman going around smashing bottles into a trash can and yelling, \"get the F#$! OUT!  Plaza time was of course 15 minutes fast to build in buffer time.  They used to have a really early closing time, when they moved it back, that took some of the wind out of that sail.  Used to go here to find the cool after-bar parties.  

I now see those endless pitchers of bud as misspent youth, but I have a zillion fond memories of the place, so can it be that bad?  I hope it hasn't changed much.  I might have to go back to Madison to check the place out.  So many fond memories."}
{"text":"The Plaza is a dive but it's a crowded old dive on weekends after 1 a.m. there are douchebags a plenty, but hey it's Madison and it's a city ordinance that douchebags have to be out and drunk and... well, douchey at 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. 

I digress. The Plaza has cheap pitchers, pretty kick ass drink specials, and some interesting clientele.  (yes, yes I'm thinking of the couple I saw dry humping in the back of the Plaza about 2 months ago...)  It's also centrally located and a fantastic place to end up after you've blown some serious cash at other more expensive bars."}
{"text":"The Plaza! Wow what a fun, cute and welcome feel you'll get when you walk in. 

Not too busy for a Saturday afternoon but there were around ten people.  A few families with babies in strollers came in after us, so a good place for families too. 

We had the plaza burgers; which were good.
Plaza sauce is great; tastes like sour cream, mayo, and ranch dressing powder.
We also ordered the half order of fries.  Too small for two and we should've known better, but we were trying to watch our weight.  They were so good and crispy we could've both ordered the whole order and eaten them all. 
Nice brew selection; and I had a crisp apple Crispin Cider!! Really great!
Probably will go again. 
Service was sweet and polite.
Food was good but not great."}
{"text":"Best bar in madison.  Sort of divey, but I might be a divey-sort of girl.

Somehow, I always end up in random bar-conversations here more so than anywhere else... (go ahead, blame it on the alcohol)

The mixed crowd allows for some pretty good people watching.

Also, while other bars may be packed to the gills on a Friday or Saturday, the bouncers do a reasonably good job at limiting the number of people inside at any one time.  You can actually breath."}
{"text":"The Plaza doesn't have the best fries ever.  It doesn't have the best food ever.  Plaza sauce is great on my burger, but it's not the most amazing burger ever.  You can find similar drink specials anywhere in Madison.  Sometimes there's a stupid line that you have to wait in.  

So what is so great about The Plaza?

Two words:  Bubble Hockey.

Flash back to 1983.  The Cold War ended but there's still tension and resentment between USA and USSR.  What better way to settle things than on the ice?  We all know how the 1980 Olympic game turned out...

(I'll sound really stupid if the teams aren't USA v. USSR and are UW v. someone else instead.  I just can't remember.  Too many beers...)

Always good times and good memories at The Plaza."}
{"text":"Everyone wants a bar like you see on tv.  
Where everyone knows your name and your drink.
This was what The Plaza was to me and my friends back in college.  Sure it was a dive bar but it was THE dive bar.  We sunk all of our extra money into this place (which translates to selling your books back to the University Bookstore for beer money). It was worth every penny. 

Home of the Plaza burger.
Air hockey.
Real phone booth.
Plastic darts.
Best jukebox.
Pool tables with actual pool sharks that brought their own schticks.  
Plaza burger with special sauce and FRIED CHEESECURDS!
Best bartenders in town.  

Holy macaroni I miss this place.  
They used to have drink specials every night of the week.  I remember my friends and I would each get a pitcher of Red Hook.  That would set each of us back only about $3.  My all time favorite drink back in the day was the Long Island Iced Tea.  Tuesdays they had two for one $2 Long Islands.  When you're a girl and with a plan of action jackson these were the answer. 

Thank you Plaza for nearly getting me kicked out of college. 
Thank you Plaza for putting me into the major leagues of drinking.
Ahmen."}
{"text":"she's a dive.  you got some smoke, a lot of drunks.  the staff is nice and the grill cheese is awesome.  they have a really cool hockey table game."}
{"text":"This is the most underrated bar in Madison.

Not for the average bar hopper, but incredibly fun. You will see every type of person in The Plaza, for better or for worse. 

The food is extraodinary for how simple it is. Get the Plaza sauce with everything. It is the best condiment I have ever tried, and I will never know what it is. I love the cheese curds with a Cheese Plaza burger.

Thursdays are the best for $2 long island nights. It gets very busy, so be sure to get there around 10-11.

Some of my favorite servers no longer work here, but they always have the most interesting people working. 

Don't buy a song on the jukebox. You will never hear it. Luckily the staff and customers have an enjoyable taste in music, so you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Good cheap drinks. The bar is a dive, but that's OK, who cares? Everyone said try the Plaza Burger. Awful, awful, awful! The burger tasted like the place looked."}
{"text":"The plaza burger. Get the plaza burger. Get extra sauce on the side. Get extra pickles.
I don't think I can be rational in anyway in my review of this place because those burgers are so good, I don't remember anything else about this place.
Honestly though, this is a great little tavern bar. I don't think I've been here after 7pm since I was in college, so I cannot attest to the \"bar scene,\" but it's a great lunch spot. Service is always quick and friendly. Good beer on tap. Usually not crazy busy for lunch or an early dinner."}
{"text":"My mom used to go here when she was a student at UW and now I am following in her footsteps (for good reason). I'm obsessed with their dive bar atmosphere and the people/staff are all really friendly. It's great for lunch (PLAZA BURGER OMG) and really fun for nightlife and drinking. Plaza is truly a gem of Madison that should be a staple for all Madisonians."}
{"text":"Two words: THURSDAY NIGHTS. Another two words? PLAZA BURGER. Last couple of words AND THE PRO TIP of this review? Add on some cheese curds to your meal and dip those curds on some plaza sauce! Thursday nights are definitely popular here. If you are in college this is a perfect place for you to start and stay for the night. After college, it's still a great place to start at and jump start your night out! Their most popular deal is their 2.50 long island ice teas, but even better is getting a double for 5 dollars. It's not your fancy cocktails, but they do not skimp on their alcohol, so drink responsibly, my friends. If you are not feeling the the long islands, my girlfriend's personal favorite discovery is their long beaches! Instead of coke, they use raspberry iced tea (shameless has become my favorite as well)."}
{"text":"Came to the Plaza Tavern on Thursday night, which is their famous 2.50$ long island night. We came early (7pm) and found a table, but as the night went on it got pretty packed. This place has pool tables, darts, and other bar games. The booths are pretty small, but we were able to fit 4 people into one. The Plaza is your typical dive bar, but it has a very comfy feel to it. It kind of reminded me of a bowling alley bar in a small town, but this gave it some charm. The long islands were cheap and very strong. We did not eat here, but I heard rumors that the plaza burger is what they are famous for in terms of food. I enjoyed the plaza bar and will come back for the cheap drinks, good atmosphere and large variety of bar games."}
{"text":"The plaza is usually great.  The bartenders are usually really nice and the waitresses are also great.  However, last time I was there, I was treated like shit.  I asked the bartender (bald guy) a question and he made a rude retort and walked away from me and it wasn't even busy.  Now I never want to go back there and it was our favorite spot.  I guess now that I remember that guy has always been a dick.  I thought bartenders liked tips.  I guess not him."}
{"text":"Can be a hit or miss.  Decent drinks and bar food (the Plaza burger is a bit over-rated but still worth checking out).  Pool and some darts.  At one point, they had a Time Crisis arcade cabinet. 

Gets an extra star for having the fastest cocktail waitress I've ever seen.  Seriously, she was like a ninja serving us whiskey."}
