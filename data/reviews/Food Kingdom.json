{"text":"This is a good hk style cafe. Do not believe the negative reviews below. The food is great for this kind of restaurant and not to mention the price!  Where else can you get a dinner special for $7.99 in this same area with soup and drink included?  The decor is nice and cleanliness is not a problem when I visited. The home style fried rice noodle is better tasting than a lot of other hk style restaurants I frequent. I highly recommend this restaurant if hk style cafe is your thing."}
{"text":"Cash only! The staff got lost with our food, gave us things that we didn't order, forgot to give us our bill, and the food was pretty bad. My fried dough sticks that came with my chicken congee were drenched in oil and I could only eat 2 of the 6 sticks before starting to feel sick. The chicken congee also had more chicken bones than meat, and more ginger than congee. My boyfriend's pork paste spaghetti was also very bland in flavour. The cost was pretty reasonable in terms of amount of food, but the quality was pretty bad. I have had better food here previously but their standards have definitely dropped in the last few times. Shame that it has gotten worse after they did all these nice renovations."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would have never found this spot if it wasn't for a recommendation from a friend. It's quite hidden in the Splendid China Tower near the larger restaurant on the right side of the mall. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant what you would expect from your typical HK-style cafe, crowded with lots of chatter. 

The service from the staff at the restaurant were satisfactory, and took the time to explain the menu to us when we had questions pertaining to the meals and how their pricing models work for certain items and meal sets. The wait time for food was relatively short, being served the soup and the main course shortly after. 

While the service game was strong, the food was overall standard by my usual HK cafe standards. The was a decent portion of food, with a very generous serving of the carb of choice (rice or spaghetti). The variety of the menu is quite vast, making choosing a meal a bit of a daunting task. The coffee-milk tea combination drink fell a bit short in terms of taste. 

I wouldn't say that this wouldn't be my go-to HK cafe restaurant, given the location of the heavy traffic of the area. While the experience was relatively positive, there are quite a few local alternatives that have better tasting drinks with a similar quality of food. 

As a tip, their daily menus are not exclusive to the labelled date. If you would like to order a set meal for another featured day, you just have to add a small price increase of $1-2."}
{"text":"New restaurant replacing lay doh. Not a great dining experience. I ordered a baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice. They were very understaffed we had to ask for water, drinks and even cutlery for our meals. When the food arrived it looked displeasing. The chop was thin and dry. It definitely was not cooked today and just tasted old. I told a few bites and decided to leave it. I make it a custom not to complain in these kinds of restaurants because 100 percent of the time you will get a rude response and a offer of something else. Looking at the menu and what the rest of my group ordered there was nothing wroth waiting for. It's easy to say restaurants like Phoenix and uglier but still a better choice May doh mops the floor with \"food kingdom\". The name sounds like an after life for food which I guess it's true since food came to die here."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I've had only positive experiences at this restaurant. I've eaten here for dine in and take out around 10 times in total. 

My favourites are the curry beef with rice, black pepper pork chop with spaghetti, and the chicken steak with spaghetti. They have daily rotating specials ranging from $7-$10. It comes with a soup and an HK style drink. The food here has always been fresher than other HK cafes and I don't know about you but I'd prefer to pay 50 cents to a dollar more instead of eating a dish that obviously came straight out of a microwave. 

The chicken steak is pretty moist, easy to cut and goes well with the sauce. The curry is on the thicker side but has the creamy texture I prefer.

The service has always been quick and attentive. The decor inside is more modern and clean, but the lighting is a little weird in there. 

Overall, I really do prefer here as one of my go to cha chaan teng places so I would definitely recommend it for lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"This place replaced Laidoh, and the Dinesafe poster said \"Conditional Pass\". I took a leap of faith because I saw many people waiting outside, so it must not have killed anyone, right? 

The new owner completely changed the decor and mood of the place. It's dark with intimate lighting, so I'm assuming they want to promote a cool spot to hang out. It looks cleaner than when it was Laidoh but could it be just because it's darker so we don't see much...? 

The spoons had water marks. As in, they didn't wipe down the spoon and we could see where the droplets were Okay... we asked to switch the spoon and they gave us a new set of spoon+chopsticks. Meh. Okay. 

We ordered Yeung Chow Fried Rice (very safe thing to get, also pretty much a benchmark dealbreaker if a place messes it up), Singaporean rice noodle, and Curry with potato and fish on rice. 

The Yeung Chow Fried Rice obviously had food colouring in it to make the rice more yellow. They didn't add sufficient egg. Their shrimps were huge, but some were not deveined and some were. Consistency...? 

The curry rice didn't have too many toppings. The table next to us got a whole bowl-ful of potato + fish but we had literally 4 pieces of potato and 3-ish pieces of fish. I say \"ish\" because one piece was literally just the batter that was supposed to go around the fish. However, we did some quick maffs and counted that we only had 2 pieces of fish meat and 1 piece of fish batter. Uh.

Also, the curry was very oily. My mom was not a huge fan of it. 

Singaporean noodles were good. Spicy enough to give a kick but not to make you die from breathing fire. They skimped out on the toppings but flavours were definitely sufficient. This was the only positive experience.

My meal came with a drink and soup. Please do NOT get the cream soup because it was literally goo with corn in there. LITERAL goo. Their water to mix ratio was definitely not correct. 

My lemon water was strange. Water had a waxy or oily surface to it. I'm thinking they didn't scrub their lemons clean enough so the wax came off. Or someone had waxy fingers? Either way, ew. 

For a place that wants to promote a cute, intimate atmosphere, the cups used were not very cute. They used those \"dai pai dong\" cups that were metal, so it looked really cheap. I'm not sure what mood they're going for here, but I was quite confused. 

In the end... I wouldn't recommend it. Hygiene is always top priority with me, but to see that they skimp out on so many things and try to cut corners, it's definitely not worth coming back. I must say that I regret making the long commute to try this place. I had initially wanted Laidoh but only stayed because we had driven so far to come here."}
{"text":"Went for afternoon tea on a weekday.  Only 3 or 4 tables of customers.

Ordered fried pork chop with fries.  Came with 2 chops.  Coated in breadcrumbs not batter.  Tasted pretty good.  Generous serving.

Tomato pork chop rice came with chinese soup.  Nice large bowl of soup.  Pork chop rice was pretty good as well.  Decent portion.

Dinner menu had lots of interesting options.  Same with breakfast menu.  Good value.

Complimentary newspapers is a nice touch.

Only minus is it took us a long time to get our change.
Overall, food was tasty.  Menu looks good.  Nice decor.  Will visit to try both breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"This newly hk style resturant replaced lai doh. I came here in the morning at around 8 am and a few tables were taken. They did some renovations and it seems like its alot cleaner. Their breakfast portions are quite big. We got the satay beef vermicelli combo which comes with garlic buttered toast and a hot drink which was $5.25. Beef was fresh, the satay sauce actually has satay flavour and vermicelli portion was quite big. The buttered toast was also quite nice because they add sone sort of garlic flavour. We also got the double egg eith luncheon meat vermicelli which also comes with toast and drink for 5.25$. The last item we got was the slice pork with perserved vegetable vermicelli which also comes with toast and drink for 5.25$. All were flavourful and portions were huge for us. 

Everything came our fresh and hot. Service was mediocre. It is only an extra $0.50 to change to instant noodle which is cheaper than alot of prices as they charge $1.00. Their lunch combos seem cheap as well, will definitely check it out later."}
{"text":"The Food Kingdom is a decent Hong Kong cafe for lunch.  We ordered typical Hong Kong cafe items: salt fish and tofu on rice, baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice and Singapore stir fried rice vermicelli.  All tasted on spot.  The tofu was impressively soft and fresh.  The stir fried vermicelli had a pleasantly strong curry spice.  There was a lot of tender pork chop in the baked dish.  The rice was really nicely made, but I wish the tomato sauce tasted more like tomato, however (LOL).  The portion of each dish can feed 1.5 person.  Unfortunately, the service was slow, from front of the house to the kitchen.  Maybe it was due to the long weekend.  

The pricing is not expensive when taking portion into consideration.  We will return for lunch."}
{"text":"Freaking eating Hong Kong style cafe and they make it like French fine dining coz you have to wait super long for everything!! First time here and will be the last time for sure!! Went here because my friend and I have a hair appointment in the same plaza and needed something quick, there was a lot of people inside, only 1 table left. Once we sat down, we looked at the menu on the stand and realized it was breakfast and afternoon tea menu (it was 1:30pm so neither applied) so we asked for menu. Had to ask TWICE and two different waitress before getting it, and it only had daily specials by days of the week... we say another menu on the table next to us, and decided to just ask the customer to pass it along since the waitress had no clue what they were doing. We ordered two sandwiches and milk tea, then it was 15-20 min wait time. While we were waiting, several ppl sitting around us was complaining about how long it took for their food to come; there was no chopsticks when they brought the food to their table; her arms are sore from keeping it raised just to get the waitresses attention, and much more, to the point that I just laughed coz obviously it wasn't only is that was getting the \"special waiting treatment\". The guy next to us ordered the beef brisket with rice, which was their daily special on Friday's, and he was waiting for at least 15-20 mins for something that didn't even need to be made fresh!! It's literally a beef stew, so all they had to do was scoop it from the pot and serve it with rice!! 
Then I finally got a waitress and asked her to pack our sandwiches to go instead of dine in, and to also get the bill, she asked me \"who took your order and what did you order?\" I bluntly replied \"you guys have a computer, can you not check the system to see if our order is ready and to pack it to go?!?!\"
Then after another 5 mins, our sandwiches came, on plates!! I had to ask for containers again to put them in and ask for the bills once more, and they brought containers and the bill without plastic bag! I can only laugh at this point, and seriously never, ever in my life will I ever come back again!!"}
{"text":"Here comes another HK style cafe! Located inside Splendid China mall lower level.

Food is ok but staff personality not so much (not rude but not welcoming either). Tried this place first time from family friend recommendation.  Tried the hainanese chicken, sweet and sour pork chops, curry potato with pork chop rice (daily special) and soy sauce beef noodles (daily special).  

Both daily specials came with tea/ coffee and soup (borscht, chinese soup of the day and cream soup).   The chinese soup was really good, flavourful and not salty.  The borscht was a sweet tomato soup; bit too sweet for my liking.   For the dishes, 3 out of 4 were well received and the one that was not a hit was the curry potatoes with pork chop which was made \"almost\" japanese style but less crusty.  For about $38.50 after tax, it's an ok find.  If it wasn't for non-daily special dishes that does not come with a bowl of rice, it may actually become a regular on my list.

Would I go back?  Maybe due to price and fairly ok flavourful food"}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars Mediocre hk cafe with forgetful staff

Food Kingdom has replaced Laidoh and tbh i'm not happy about it. They did renovate making it more enjoyable to dine in but portions have since been reduced. We ordered the curry chicken and bolognese pasta. The curry was lacking, it tasted more like portuguese chicken sauce. The milk tea is very bland, not the least bit fragrant. 

The servers are very forgetful and it was not because it was busy. They forgot to give us soup and the milk tea that i took togo was sweetened though I asked for no sugar. She asked if we needed boxes to pack the leftovers when we asked for the bill but she didn't end up bringing it.."}
{"text":"There is nothing \"traditional\" with my Noodle in Traditional Sauce ????? ($5.99).

Just imagine using the Hong Kong Style Cafe Bolognese meat sauce and add preserved pickled veggie topped on noodle and served with a side of corn?!! One of the most nasty lo mein I ate in a restaurant.

Luckily the complimentary Hong Kong Style milk tea was decent.

Maybe Food Kingdom menu is just too big. Maybe trimming down their menu will help? If some items are not good enough to serve or just caught the kitchen by surprise because some one really ordered that, please just take that off the menu.

I don't know if I would be brave enough to come back to try out other items. But with so many other options in Scarborough, Food Kingdom would be a pass for me."}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as the reviews state. It's your typical HK cafe, though feels a bit cleaner.

Lots of daily specials at reasonable prices - food wise it's pretty average fare too. They've got your club sandwiches, congee, noodles, baked rice and  spaghetti dishes, as well as lots of sizzling plate items like steak and pork chop. Nothing exceptional except for the long lines on weekend which talk to how much the locals like this place.

I'd say it's definitely worth a try if you don't have to line up that long!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for Sunday lunch. There was already a line outside the door. There were four tables ahead, waiting. The inside seating comprised of booth seats by both walls and long rectangle tables in the centre of the room. Chances of having to sort of share a long rectangle table with other people are high, unless waited for a booth seat. The restaurant was pretty busy so getting a server's attention and them doing what was asked for was a bit of a mission.

Pretty standard HK diner menu. Breakfast, afternoon tea, daily special and the normal menu. Ordered from both menus today. The portions were very decent and the daily special was a good deal, price wise. Have several options to choose from, comes with drink, soup and newspaper. The soup that came with the meal was also larger than other HK diners. Everything was average, if not a little below because of the saltiness. Woke up this morning craving noodle in soup, ordered just that but couldn't have any of the soup because it was just too salty. The pork chop rice was good after most of the tomato sauce was scooped off. As for the Hainan chicken rice, the rice had a mild flavour but lacked the oiliness making it a little dry. A very filling meal in the end.

Overall, there are better HK diners so there won't be a second visit."}
