{"text":"The Oyster Po Boy is the Bomb!!  My husband and I were down in NC and had lunch here. The restaurant lives up to its great reputation."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ever had the pleasure of finding. What there for lunch with a large crew worm work service was fast and food was great."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is a cool atmosphere!  If you're a foodie, you'll love this place!  I had the scallops for appetizer...a little on the salty side, but how can you go wrong when sautéed with bacon?!  The blackened flounder with country ham grit cake and sautéed veggies was delicious...so much flavor and very well prepared textures!  The sweet tea served in a mason jar was a neat touch.  Oh, you MUST get the cobbler of the day...the peach was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food at Jake's. The prices are very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food. Everything is presented in an interesting and appetizing fashion and the food is simple, but still interesting. The kids meals are great and the chicken fingers look housemade and fresh. The BLT was also a hit. I really like the fried green tomatoes, though I'd prefer a remoulade type sauce to the balsamic it's currently served with. I don't think they serve any alcohol, not even beer or wine. Otherwise, the atmosphere is rustic, but cool and the food can't be beat. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ok, drove past this place a thousand times, never gave it much of a thought, infact assumed its was an abandoned gas station.   Glad  we stopped in amazing food, NOT diner cheap but very reasonable.    Fried green tomato was best ever had!  Shrimp and oyster po boy was comparable to the ones I had in New Orleans !  Scallops were amazing ! Done to perfection !    And for dessert we shared a peanut butter pie,  it was just Amazing we rolled out of there full and happy.   Great meal.   We since went several times and still go at least once a week.  What a great little place !!"}
{"text":"Almost always good. Almost always crowded. My only complaint is that his Pork Chop was a little undercooked. I highly recommend the venison quesadillas and whatever they have on special.   It is obvious that the chef enjoys making great food."}
{"text":"I'd give them a '4' if the service was better. They always seem to be understaffed. The food takes forever (even for something simple) and the staff is usually not attentive (one new, blonde girl seems to be doing better)  Good food.  Reasonable prices.   I absolutely hate that they never give you a fresh drink refill (they use pitchers full of drink + ice = watered down drink)   Food impresses.  Homemade sauces make most items very good. The deserts are also impressive.  It's the details that annoy me about this place.  I usually have to be dragged to eat here."}
{"text":"Best food and really cordial service . Try poboy or shredded chicken.. try ever thing on menu"}
{"text":"This is actually my second time here, but I wasn't super hungry the first time, and just mooched off my dining companion, and he got hot wings, which I loathe, and the BBQ plate, which, well, oh dear, should I admit to this on a North Carolina page? well, I don't like vinegar sauce at all. He sure knew how to protect his lunch!  Anyways, reading the other reviews, I'm mega-bummed we didn't get any biscuits while we waited for dinner.  :( There were also no specials that night, and they were out of salmon.  It was crazy busy (short staffed maybe? There was only one waitress and the old lady at the front register.) when we got there and we ended up waiting for a while before getting seated, luckily there's a lot of random stuff on the walls/shelves to look at so you don't get too bored.  I had the oyster po boy and it was good! It probably had a little too much mayo and made a bit of a mess combined with how the tomatoes and lettuce were stacked, but other than that, no complaints. I didn't think potato chips and honey mustard was a combination that'd work but it totally did, what a nice surprise.  I also tried a little bit of the blackened chicken with fettuccine alfredo and it was interesting, the alfredo sauce's flavour reminded me a little bit of mac and cheese in a positive way, although it was a surprise when I tasted it.  I heard the waitress telling another table that there was only one dessert left that night so we decided to pass on that. Overall I'd probably come here again for lunch since its nearby."}
{"text":"Been there a few times. I agree with the other reviews, service is a little slow, but always friendly. Jake's is a small place and not a lot of staff. Food is good, Fried oysters are amazing.  We will keep going back. And you can always find them on Groupon."}
{"text":"Overpriced! They give us the check without price so when we paid at the counter... 38 bucks for  entrée of salmon with risotto, pulled pork sandwhich, extra fries and toast. The servers are ok but their food is blah overpriced."}
{"text":"Things are always good here. This time we had The BBQ chicken with the homemade mac n cheese, and it is to die for. The BLT sandwich was so delicious. Brimming with Bacon. Reasonably priced, and the wait staff Elias so attentive."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the chop its huge.friendly service and down home atmosphere."}
{"text":"WOW!  What an amazing experience of southern hospitality and fresh home cooking!  Gotta love the fresh biscuit that comes out for each guest.  The fried green tomatoes were so delicious and the wedge can compete with any I have ever had.  The feature of the day was Jean's pot roast and it melted in my mouth.  It was over top of amazing garlic mashed potatoes and a medley of fresh vegetables.  I cannot write enough good things about my experience.  Great place to have a laid back home-cooked meal and relax.  Thank you - I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! The pork chop is divine and the bacon braised scallops are the best! So far everything we've ever had here is wonderful! The service is great and the atmosphere is quaint. Would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great find on the far East side of town!  More \"upscale\" than I expected for a refurbished gas station!  BBQ was excellent and the (apparently) home-made blue cheese dressing to dip you chips in was a great surprise.  Didn't order the \"large ticket items\" off the dinner menu, but I bet they are as good as the BBQ.  When I am out on I-485 East of Charlotte, you can bet I will stop by..."}
{"text":"We kept going by Jake's for over a year and once day we just said lets try it . we were pleasantly surprised and extremely happy we did. The burgers actually tastes like a burger should, nice and juicy and cooked to perfection. The fries were perfect and better then any fast food places. I highly recommended it to anyone out and about on Albemarle rd. Menu is on line so you can order on your way. You won't be sorry you did."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. I took my wife tonight for a o pre-Valentine dinner.  The food was adequate, but expensive.  The service was the worse we have experienced in a long time.  Even after ordering a salad, asking fir it twice, I never git it. When I asked the waitress to take it off my bill, she acted as if she was surprised.  To blond to realize she never brought it to me. My wife was ticked and told them so. She was ticked that they wouldn't show us the bill. We are not sure that they took the salad off.  The bill did not add up.  I don't think l will be able to get my wife to go back. Service was truly terrible.  You are warned."}
{"text":"Great food. I mean everything is great. Nice, quaint place.  The only drawback is limited seating and no reservations so you need to go early or late.  Prime time is out the door."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to Jakes because of the previous review.  However, i left very disappointed.  I ordered a BLT that was dry with white lettuce.  My mother ordered a hamburger all the way.  The bun was just a cheap grocery store plain white bun and the meat tasted funny, so it was left uneaten.  At least, I thought I had the pie to look forward to.  But no.  They were out of pie, which left us with lemon squares that had absolutely no lemon flavor whatsoever.  On the upside, my daughter enjoyed the wings  and the homemade chips were very good.  The people who work there were very friendly and the atmosphere is has a nice country appeal.  Someone had a great idea.  They just need to make a few food quality adjustments."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out this small, local restaurant and were quite pleased.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  The food was delicious - cooked to order.  My husband had a rib-eye steak and said it was cooked perfectly. We'll be back!  (Dinner for 2 + 1 dessert = $35)  Located at 12721 Albemarle Road, Charlotte, NC, near I-485.  704-545-4741, open for lunch and dinner only"}
{"text":"Just plain awesome. A must try is the pork chops. Great friendly atmosphere. Great eats"}
{"text":"I've never had anything but an excellent meal at Jake's. The 3 of us had filets and they were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Went with the family for a late lunch and had to wait for about 20 minutes; the restaurant is small and several other parties were waiting to be seated, so we sat on the Adirondack chairs outside.  Skip the artichoke dip (lacking in richness and seasoning), deviled eggs (filling was far too herbaceous--dill and parsley--and the eggs were overcooked), pimento cheese on celery (nothing special here), chicken wings (again, very generic), and burgers. The fired oysters were outstanding--perfectly juicy and with a pleasantly crisp cornmeal exterior. Sea scallops were very nicely seasoned and charred beautifully, although slightly overcooked inside and one had a fair bit of grit. The venison quesadilla was very flavorful and cooked beautifully--crispy tortilla and tender, flavorful venison with richly caramelized peppers and onions along with cheese inside. (It came with a side of pepper jelly and shredded iceburg which rounded things out nicely, but I still feel as though this dish could have been even more perfect.) All the seafood was extremely fresh. The sauces, as well, are very good--a flavorful, rich ranch with the chicken wings and burgers and a very lovely homemade tartar sauce with the oysters. Overall, the food could have had a bit more salt, especially on the delicious homemade potato chips which came with the burger.  Desert was disappointing. Portions were skimpy and the \"coconut cream pie\" and \"chocolate cream pie\" (which was really more like a brownie pie) were poorly executed. \"Homemade pound cake\" was nothing special at all--a bit dry and rather un-interesting."}
{"text":"It's a gamble going here. Sometimes you have great service and food and other times they are understaffed, waitresses have bad attitudes, and totally different food. Just never know what to expect."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been at eating at Jake's for about 2 years. My eyes light up when we decide to eat there!! The place is cozy and the staff are so nice. The only downfall is there is limited seating; if you arrive after 6:00pm be prepared to wait....but it's so worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I had the Po boy shrimp sandwich and it was fresh and above average.  My husband had the meatloaf and it was average.  The kitchen time to get your food was longer than average and there was only about 3 tables occupied because we went outside the lunch hour rush.  Don't go if your in a rush.  The wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food.  Long waits for food that is good, but not worth that long of a wait.  Soda refills by the pitcher variety (ensure warm and watered down refills)  Very good burger for lunch that is surprisingly cheap, if you have 1.5 hours to burn  I get the urge to go here, every few months.  It could be a 4 star pretty easily, with a bit more staff"}
{"text":"Fried oysters. Banana pudding. Salmon. Friendly and helpful waitress. Nice presentation. Comfy, cozy.  Review for 5/18/2010"}
{"text":"Apparently this place really doesn't need business. Tried to place an order to be picked up for a local family dinner for four. Was told that they simply couldn't accept an order at the time. That is certainly an experience I have never had. This is a novel place, but the novelty is probably not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Time of visit: Tue night 7:00 Wait time: 5 mins.  We got lucky.  Cool that they offer beers out of an antique cooler while you wait. Food: Honey Hot wings, ranch, celery sticks - meaty and delicious, homemade ranch? was a nice compliment to the wings. Shrimp Po Boy w/homeade chips and a pickle - phenomenal, crunchy roll, garlic mayo was very tasty, shrimp was jumbo and cooked to perfection, cold, fresh toppings were a very nice compliment to shrimp and roll.  Lots of texture.  Better than the po boy I had in New Orleans!  Pulled BBQ Plate with cole slaw and pasta salad - Pork was above average, sauce wasn't too vinegary, pasta was a big portion and good.   Would like to try the BBQ chicken and pork chops next time. Drinks: Sweet Tea in a Mason jar, nice touch Dessert: Next time; we were in a hurry and although the peach cobbler sounded good, I was craving banana pudding. Decor: Old gas station antiques spread throughout sets a nice ambiance.  The xmas lights, however, do not. Service: Efficient, friendly and they all worked together very well. Food was out in about ten minutes. Price: Walked out with a very reasonable bill for two entrees and an appetizer. Return: No hesitation to return to this joint. I've already referred a couple people."}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\", so a group of friends wanted to check it out.  When we got there we were quoted a time of 15 minutes (group of 8 on a Tuesday night), an hour and a half later they said it would just a few minutes more.  Then after 15 more minutes, we were told they could see us if we ssat at 2 different tables.  We waited a bit after being seated, then after ordering we received our food about 30 minutes later.    Looked like they were short staffed.  The food was delicious (I had the Pan Seared NY Strip), but they ran out of desserts.    When our checks were delivered 20% gratuity had been added even though they separated our party...DISLIKE!  Most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"This is a Good As It Gets for Sure!!!!!!   I ate here the first time today, and the flounder was absolutely fresh and cooked to perfection.  The applewood smoked bacon made the best BLT.  The tomatoes are vine ripened--not like from the supermarket.  The prices are very reasonable.  Easy to Get to, right off 485, Albemarle exit (E) just up the street.  The pasta salad was superb.  I can't wait to come back again.  I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"From the outside....a run-down old timey filling station advertising Meritta Bread with no pumps visible...on the inside...still has the feel of a country store....but more. Very attentive wait staff from start to finish...knowledgeable about specials as well as all menu items. I went for the special which was fresh grouper \"blackened\" along with incredible REAL mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. My wife was not as hungry and decided on a house salad with their vinaigrette dressing. I could not resist ordering the fried green tomatoes which prevented me from enjoying one of their many homemade desserts....but I assure you...the fried green tomatoes served served on a bed of braised leeks with a vinaigrette sauce was well worth the miss on dessert this time around...cause I know we will be back....with friends! Oh yes..and the small HOT homemade biscuits with butter were a nice touch as well as we waited on our meal.   The menu is not overwhelming and they serve their lunch menu at dinner as well...a nice change. Lunch items includes a shrimp and oyster Po boy (which we noticed several people enjoying that evening).  Check out their current menu with this link: http://www.jakesgoodeats.com/menu  Just remember they always have some nice specials which seem to be according to fresh, local, and the chef's whelm!   I know we should be careful ever awarding 5 stars to any restaurant....but for my tastes including nice casual dining, friendly and attentive service, and GREAT food...this one hit ALL the marks. We were calling people on the way home to let them know they needed to come and try Jakes."}
{"text":"The food was really good and fair priced. I dig the feel of the place."}
{"text":"Ok ok. Here we stand in front of what use to be a gas station. It's cute and all but never did I imagine what wonderful culinary surprises waits for me inside. The decor is rustic and just so adorably country. Gas station antiques strewn about in a very organized and delightful way As we sat down we were treated cheerfully by the owners mother who was quick as a fox and friendly as an old neighbor. We were offered cold drinks in mason jars and given our menus to browse. The napkins were mechanics orangey towels and I thought that was a unique touch. We were told by our waitress of the specials and encouraged to try the Pan Seared Scallops over Bacon Braised Spinach and Venison Quesadilla with Grilled Onions! With Roasted Peppers and Melted Monterrey Jack Cheese. We also ordered the Turkey Burger served on a toasted bun With roasted red pepper mayo, lettuce, tomato, apple smoked bacon and melted provolone cheese as well as the Pork Loin sandwich with home made potato chips. Can I just say that the first bite of the scallops exploded a slightly crisp, tender, and flavor filled gift to each and every taste bud in my mouth. They were eaten very methodically so as not to waste a single nuance they offered up. The bed of spinach they were nested in was just as special and eatch leaf danced deliciously all over my sense of taste. Then came the Venison Quesadilla. That was a perfect way to follow the scallops. It was an unusual paring with the pepper jelly but it was just meant to be. Just like the perfect sunset, you just would not change a thing. Now for the main course for our lunch. I could go on and on about dancing flavors, explosives delights, and beautiful sunsets but I think it is suffice to say that we we will go back again even though it is an hour and a half from our home! Thank you Jake and thank you Good Eats!"}
{"text":"My mom lives out this way and it's a wasteland food-wise. But lucky me, used my trusty Yelp App to find a suitable lunch spot. I can't believe this little gem was so close to her casa and we had no idea!   The exterior is easy to miss from the road. It doesn't look like much of a restaurant and the sign is sorta low-key. I guess the location is an old convenience/gas/food store? The interior is plain but very cute! Lots of throw back, vintage accents and decor.   My family and I split an order of fried green tomatoes... YUM! They were gone in moments, ha!  They're definitely not the best I've had (I prefer mine a little thicker/chunkier) but there was nothing to complain about regarding the taste. The braised leeks were an unexpected twist. The balsamic was nice, but no substitute for a creamier sauce.  My only major complaint about Jake's is that the menu is NOT vegetarian friendly. Other than our appetizer, there was nothing available on the lunch menu for me to eat.. WHAT? Fortunately, the chef was kind and was willing the prepare the ONLY vegetarian entree option... The Seasonal Veg Plate. Which was delicious! It was a TRIO:  grilled asparagus, grilled zucchini/squash/carrots/tomatoes with olive oil, and a cheese tortellini with cream sauce. The pasta was my least favorite but the veggies were the BOMB! especially the ASPARAGUS... mmmmm.   My mom ordered a Hamburger with chili and slaw, which she at every single bite of. My brother ordered the Stuffed BLT which he inhaled, basically. Both sandwiches came with homemade potato chips. I tried several of these.. super yum. Perfect in that some were super crispy and others a little chewy still... which I love.   Best part about our visit to Jake's? The price? Lunch for three people + appetizer? $30 before tip? Now that's a deal!!"}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. I was really excited to try it out and was not disappointed.   Great atmosphere with very homey decor. My friend and I had an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. They were served with a balsamic vinegar sauce that was excellent, the tomatoes were on the thin side, some tasted like only fried breading with  no actual tomato but other than that they were good.   I had the BBQ sandwich with slaw while my friend had the fried oyster po' boy. Both sandwiches were a delicious lunch option and I would recommend getting both. Unfortunately I'm not from the Charlotte area so I don't know how many times I'll be able to test out different items on Jake's menu but I have a feeling most things would be pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon after hitting the nearby trails.  The group had an appetite and was in for a treat.  The fried green tomatoes are absolutely ridiculous.  They are crazy good.  The burgers and special can't be beat. Fried egg and bacon on a burger.  I'll type that again....fried egg and bacon on the burger.  A little gravy on the top is a perfect capper.  A near-perfect mix of lemonade and tea was a great chaser.  The service was very, very good and all folks there were very attentive.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me one saturday and drove me out to Jake's. He had never been there before and was excited to try it. Once again, the food was fantastic. We ordered a wedge salad to split and they split it for us in the kitchen and brought us our own little portions. PERFECT! He got a burger (all the way) that was amazing. I tried the tuna salad and it was fantastic. If you're a sweet tea fan, I recommend trying it! Yummo."}
{"text":"This was our first culinary stop in Charlotte and well worth the detour.  The completely unassuming exterior (an old filling station), and funky interior in no way prepares you for the tasty treats on the menu. From sandwiches to creative main dishes, the food is prepared with great care.  I had the delicious blackened flounder with crayfish sauce on a cake of grits with country ham and it was delicious. My wife was very happy with her salmon and the adjacent table seemed to relish their po' boys.  They also have surprisingly good wines on their list where you would not expect them.  It was definitely worth a return trip.  Service was very friendly and good.  It made you happy to be there."}
{"text":"The food was a 5 but due to our waitress, I was forced to rate it a 2  Our waitress, Tanis, was extremely rude during the entire experience.  We had a party of 15 that had traveled from out of town for Thanksgiving 2012.  They saw this restaurant featured on Diners Drive ins & Dives, and were DYING to try it! Tanis ruined the entire meal.  As we were leaving, we very politely informed the cashier of what had taken place during our meal-mid conversation Tanis comes around the corner and aggressively verbally attacks one of our family members for complaining. My family and I have never felt so threatened.   Overall the food was EXCELLENT~However, we WILL NOT return because of Tanis. She was an awful server and would never make it in an upscale restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little joint off of 485. Smaller menu with good selection. We had a shrimp boy and shoestring fries which was amazing also had a bbq sandwich with pasta salad which was good but wouldn't get again, They were both somewhat bland.  Our waitress was nice and attentive as much as she could be with how busy it was."}
{"text":"Jake's Good Eats is a great restaurant. I have lunch there as often as I can. I always get the Scallops appetizer. They're excellent! I always get the Shrimp Po'boy for lunch. Amazing!!! Service is always on par. Prices are very reasonable. Dessert is homemade by Jake's Mom and always delicious!!"}
{"text":"What a delight. Practically gourmet american food in a quaint diner setting. Fried oysters and fried green onions were great appetizers. The pork chop and flounder entrees had us all raving. We had four desserts to share between 5 all great but the strawberry pecan bread was unique and wonderful. Service was excellent and friendly. Nowhere to beat Jake's in the area. It's a tiny place worth a visit for foodies."}
{"text":"FOOD: My husband and I tried two different items from their entree menu which sounded like it had some great tasty twists on traditional foods. The food tasted fine, but it wasn't nearly as exciting as the menu made it sound. I can recommend the salmon, but the chicken and mac&cheese was a little bland. Altogether, we would have been quite happy with it - if the dishes hadn't been 18 and 14 dollars respectively. For that money I can eat at a much better restaurant.  SERVICE: Service was very friendly, but also very slow. Long wait for a table, tables were left with dirty dishes on them for over ten minutes while there was a dozen people waiting. Our waitress didn't refill our drinks until we stopped her and asked for it. Food took a long time to come out, but I usually accept that if the food is good and made from scratch.  ENVIRONMENT and UNIQUENESS: The place is cute, has a rustic retro-coca-cola style. It feels like Jake's is trying to be like one of those typical southern diners/restaurants but with a slightly better quality/higher-end menu. I suppose it succeeds in that, but again, if I want to spend that much money, I would personally go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. They take their time preparing and presenting your meal and you can taste the love in every bite. The environment isn't for everyone but we love the small gas station feel. As for the food pricing I would probably say it's  $$. Always a good experience for us!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and just as good as my first visit I think I could eat the fired green tomatoes all day the cut is perfect. The only thing is if you don't know where you're going you'll miss this spot! This is the type of place you'll want to keep in rotation. Servers were good both visits and entrees matched."}
{"text":"This is southern dining at it's finest!  I dine here as often as I can. From it's rustic appearance (complete with live horses) to it's friendly staff, Jake's asks you to come on in and sit for a spell. Then the keep you coming back with incredible food, including the best po' boy I've ever eaten and venison quesadillas that are completely out of this world.  I'm so glad they finally got the license to sell beer. It completes the experience.  Be prepared to wait on weekends, but otherwise you can walk right in.   Jake's ranks tops in Carolina eatin'!"}
{"text":"Heard really great things about this place since it was on that food show but honestly it wasn't all that great for me.  I ordered the chicken sandwich. My food was just \"warm\", drinks were \"flat\" (ordered 3 different kinds), and prices were higher than expected.  The chicken was seasoned ok but dry. I tried to eat my food rather quickly due to all the flies also wanting a taste . My coworkers seemed to enjoy their meals though. Maybe I should have ordered the burger! Our server was nice and the ladies restroom was clean!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a ton of times without really noticing it. Finally, I decided to check it out.  This place has a real country feel. Not that \"fake\" country that some places try to put on. It felt authentic. Your new name will be \"sugga\" or \"hun.\"  Mason jar of sweet tea, and the refills kept coming. They offered to give me a to-go cup of tea when I left as well.   I went with the cheeseburger all the way. All the way meant Carolina style, which I love. Chilli, slaw, mustard, sauteed onions. The burger was cooked perfect. Real juicy with just the slightest hint of pink. The chilli, oh the chilli. This stuff was the best chilli I can remember having on a burger or dog. The little bit of \"kick\" or \"twang\" from the chilli is balanced by the subtle sweetness of the white slaw and caramelized onions.  The burger was a little on the small size. It came with homemade photo chips which were very good.  Next time I think I'll try to shrimp po'boy."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh made to order.  The menu has a lot of variety and most days they have an off the menu feature that has never disappointed. Their wine and beer selection is basic, but covers enough to complement the great food. It's a small place, the hours are limited and in a remote area between I 485 and highway 51 on Albemarle Road, but well worth the visit. The food and service is always top-notch."}
{"text":"Ok....I really wanted to LOVE this place.  It's near my hometown, it's in an old gas station and it offers a decent menu.  But, alas,  everyone was right, the service is not the best.   I ate lunch here today with my father and was surprised at the amount of people there at 1 p.m. on a Tuesday.  I wondered where they all came from on this desolate stretch of 24/27.  We only had to wait a few moments for a table so I was hopeful that the service would be just as fast.    We ordered the Venison Quesadillas as an appetizer and waited and waited for them to arrive.  They were very flavorful, a little heavy on the oil/grease from the sauteed veggies but delicious just the same.  Don't be scared to try them thinking they'll taste \"game-y\".   I ordered the Flounder sand which with their homemade chips and my father ordered the Turkey burger (chips as well).  30 min. later while several other people that were seated after us seemed to get their orders, our food arrived.  Now to me, it doesn't matter how wonderful your food is, if it takes too long to bring out my order, I won't be back....(I'm talking about you Comet Bar and Grill).     The Flounder was good and like all fish sammies, it was a little soggy.  What I ate that wasn't sandwiched in between the bun was pretty decent.  I don't know why they don't put fish on a heartier bread than a regular hamburger bun, it always falls apart.  The first chip I bit (or rather chewed) into was very soft and so was the next several chips.  All in all, the batch of chips my dad and I received were a mix of crunchy and stale chips.  Now, I know we were there close to closing and they probably didn't want to \"whip up\" a new batch of  chips just for us but come on, the amount of time it took for our order I would have appreciated it.  My dad said the Turkey burger had a certain spice that he didn't care for and I think he was referencing the Pepper Mayo that came on it.      Needless to say, due to the extra long wait time for our food and underwhelming presentation, I won't be back for lunch again.  I may give them a last chance and try the dinner menu but given the lack luster lunch and high cost (for what you get), I think I'll probably end up taking my money, and time, elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our experience at Jakes!!! Greeted when we came in with pleasant conversation from the owner, the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was sweet and comfy!!! Our waitress was on her game!! Everything was on point and we have made this one of our main restaurants for great food and atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Had the shrimp po boy and pasta salad for lunch.   I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I was in NC for the weekend, visiting friends and family. A bunch of old high school friends wanted to meet up for dinner, and a friend suggested this place, since she saw it on DDD (Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives). They don't take reservations, but we told them we were coming and to get ready. ;) When we got there, we had to wait for maybe 15 minutes until our table was ready. Our waitress was as sweet as she could be. First thing she does after dropping off our drinks is bring us a stack of johnny cakes to munch on. They were pretty good- kind of like cornbread in a pancake form. I ordered the veggie plate (about the only entree a vegetarian could eat), and it was awesome! I think it changes every so often, but that night it was grilled asparagus, sauteed spinach, a veggie mix of yellow squash, zucchini, and onions and then some cheese tortellini. Everything was excellent. I was still a little hungry afterwards, so a friend and I split a blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was really good, but I like to have a little ice cream in every bite, and there wasn't enough ice cream on top. A friend got the scallop appetizer and said it was excellent. Another friend got the blackened flounder, and although she said it was good, it was a little too spicy for her. All in all, what I ate was very good, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Did you say meatloaf sandwich? Jake's is a Hidden gem.   I love this place! Food is amazing. As a picky eater (rarely ever eats burgers and never eat leftovers), I can't believe Yelp never showed me this place.  Literally been living by here for 5 years and finally went inside.  The fired green tomatoes and meatloaf sandwich have me addicted. After eating here three weeks in a row for Saturday lunch, I hate to miss it tomorrow.   I've had the same beautiful waitress, who now knows exactly how I want my order. Staff is patient. Has a flat screen tv to watch the game.    Can't wait to try their dinner.    Tip: There will be a small wait, but it Is worth it.   Might get to see the horses out back or play checkers during the wait."}
{"text":"We went back to try Jake's for dinner and were not disappointed.  We started with the spinach & artichoke dip served w/house made flour tortilla chips. The chips were light, warm, and tasty. The dip was very good - just the right mixture of spinach, artichoke and cheese.   (4.5 stars) Then, we split a wedge salad (minus the bacon) - the blue cheese dressing was very flavorful. (4.5 stars)  For the entrees, we ordered the shrimp/crawfish etouffe served over rice and the grilled BBQ chicken (served w/grilled broccoli & mac-n-cheese).   The etoufee was wonderfully flavored with just the right amount of spice.  (5 stars) The BBQ chicken was slightly sweet, but had a nice flavor. The mac-n-cheese was made of penne pasta and white cheese sauce. It was not the traditional southern style mac-n-cheese that I was expecting, but it was good. (3.5 stars)  The portion size of the bbq chicken dish was huge - definitely enough for 2 meals. We decided to splurge and try a dessert too.  We went with the chocolate pie.  It was good, but a bit too sweet for my tastes.  (3 stars)   Our server told us that they had 1/2 price bottles of wine on special, but we skipped the vino on this visit.  I didn't see a beer or wine menu so not sure what options they have.   I think our bill came to around $43 for all of this food - not bad at all.   The place was packed, so we ended up sitting at a bar table in the front by the door.  This is not an optimal spot - with cold air blowing in each time the door opened and a crowd of people standing around watching you eat as they waited for tables. Definitely plan to get there early so you can get a seat in the main dining area. (Also, parking spots can be a bit tough to come by if you arrive at a busy time.)   One downside to Jakes is that they have a pretty limited menu. I know in the restaurant world, that is actually a pretty good thing in terms of managing inventory and keeping focus on doing a few things really well... but for me, I think the menu options here are limited to the point that I probably won't be back that often.  It might be nice if they had some really killer specials on rotation to keep things interesting.  (Like the chicke & waffles I had on my lunch visit - THAT was something I'd come back for!!)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich with homemade chips and the banana bread cupcakes for dessert. All of it was awesome! I couldnt believe I ate the whole sandwich, it was sooo good. The chicken was moist and tender and the bread was tasty. A new favorite. The banana bread cupcakes, were small. But packed a lot of flavor into them. You dont need a big one. Perfect size. Wait staff were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Impress a date...try something different...try something out of the ordinary...Try JGE.  A renovated gas station turned into an awesome restaurant.  I love the feel of this place when you walk in its so homey, dishrag for napkins, and drinks served in mason jars. The service was beyond friendly and we were very well taken care of.    I first heard of this place on the Food Networks Diner Drive-ins and Dives so of course I went there for all the delicious food I saw Guy Fieri eat.  My first choice for the appetizer was venison quesadillas but unfortunately they were out of venison - however the owner apologized and explained that they only serve products that they know are good and they weren't able to get the shipment of venison in from their regular vendor..so forgiven but I still really want to try them.  Chicken wings, caesar salad, and pan seared salmon over a potato cake with dill sauce - I was really happy with my meal overall and can't wait to come back for some more good eats."}
{"text":"A different place with a different take on restaurant theme all together. An old gas station turned into a restaurant, Jake's good eats is a definitely a place to go if you dig BBQ. Drinks served in mason jars was a first for me. The pulled BBQ chicken sandwich is the best. Goat cheese BBQ risotto and the fried green tomatoes are awesome for vegetarians. Home made hand cut fries are crispy crunchy and not too salty."}
{"text":"So sad, we saw this on triple D's and went out of our way to come and they were closed for the 4th of July week. I would have called if this was the 4th but this was the 6th of July and I was shocked that the entire place was closed. Definitely, call before going to make sure they are open."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the staff is wonderful!  If you go in on a night they have wings make sure you get an order bc they are great!"}
{"text":"This place is literally right at the end of my road. I've lived here for almost 8 years and had only been in once for lunch, but had never taken the family. We finally decided to give it a shot and went with a group of nine. This is a small sized establishment, but they were very accommodating to our group which included three children. They didn't have a lot of space, so they put us at three separate, but adjacent tables. Service was excellent even with our large, disconnected group.   As for the food, it was fantastic. I had the duck with mushroom risotto and it was both delicious and beautifully presented. We had a couple of vegetarians in the group who were probably not as enamored with the menu as I was, but my food was fantastic.  Parking is pretty lousy, but the food is excellent and the service even better. Great local spot!"}
{"text":"Burger good, but not as great as expected from all the hype.  The much anticipated and high priced friend green tomatoes were really thin, too thin!  You didn't even know there was a tomato.  Service was pleasant, but very slow.  Our friends had to order several times until they had what they wanted.  They were out of everything, but maybe it was because it was late Saturday and they close on Sunday.  I would possibly return, but it's not high on my list."}
{"text":"Oysters for appertizer...go ahead and ask for extra cocktail sauce...they don't put enough on the plate...and you will never get someone to bring more.  Fried green tomatoes awesome...again, you will probably need more sauce and relish...so ask now!  Their pork chop is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Incredible!!!  The service here sucks out loud. I have never seen more servers dash about...so busy, but so incredibly inefficient. We had to track someone down for appetizer plates...then they were removed one by one by various people dashing about. Seriously...they are busy...but there is no rhythm or efficiency in site. I'm talking 12 tables...and 5 servers!!! It is crazy!  The food is really good...but the service is so frustrating."}
{"text":"This place is really small, but we went before noon on a Saturday. We both got the BBQ on a recommendation from a friend. So far, this is the best BBQ I've found in Charlotte. The vinegar-based sauce is the only choice, which is just fine with me. It could have been spicier in my opinion, but it wasn't bad. It was relatively inexpensive compared to the other menu items (especially dinner items)."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" and am always interested in trying out new places, so my wife and I made the trek out to East Charlotte a few Saturdays back for lunch.    We split an order of fried green tomatoes to start, and then had the shrimp po' boy and the hamburger all-the-way.  The fried green tomatoes were fantastic, and I don't know if I'll ever get around to trying any of the other appetizers.  I'll probably just order them every time I go.  The shrimp po' boy and hamburger were very good too, but both were a little on the small side.  I'm eager to visit for dinner and try some of the entrees, but I hope they're a little more filling.  I was definitely still hungry when I was finished, but everything I ate was delicious.  Although everyone who works there seemed very friendly and helpful, there seems to be a disconnect between the capacities of the kitchen and dining room.  It didn't matter this time around because we were just out having a leisurely lunch, but based on this visit, I would not recommend Jake's if time is a factor.  We waited almost a half hour for a table even though there were several available and there seemed to be plenty of wait staff.  We were told \"the kitchen is backed up\" and they couldn't seat us until they got on top of the lunch rush.  When we were finally seated, it still took quite a while to get our food.  The dishes at Jake's are pretty gourmet for a little roadside cafe, and it seems that the kitchen has trouble keeping up with the restaurant's popularity.  If this is indeed the problem, I'm not sure what a good solution would be.  The unexpectedly complex dishes are what makes Jake's so great to begin with so I wouldn't favor simplifying the menu much.  Also, the menu doesn't seem to be loaded down with a surplus of options that could bog down a kitchen.  In the end, maybe the were just having an off day and were understaffed.  I'm looking forward to going back and giving them another try soon."}
{"text":"Jake's is one of the places where the concept is such a cool idea that people keep coming back even when the reality proves to be very lack luster.   I've been here a handful of times, and have left each with the intention of not coming back.  Service has almost always been a problem,  I've also experienced a number of quality  issues with the food- under cooked, over cooked, bland etc.   However I find myself returning every six months or so to give them another chance.  The draw of the cool location and concept with the idea of creative southern food overrides my common sense.  Most recently I didn't even get into the dining room.  I was with a party of three at 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Walking in, the front area was filled with people waiting while I could see that there were at least a half dozen tables clean and open.  The girl acting as hostess and cashier was less than thrilled and was clearly overwhelmed ( seems to be a constant here).  After 20 mins of watching this mess and several passive aggressive comments by the hostess we gave up and left.      Hopefully this time the lesson will sink in and I won't find myself at the door step of Jake's again.    Instead I'll enjoy an establishment that can deliver on its promise."}
{"text":"Outstanding surprise of good food, service and deserts. I'll definitely be back. The homage chips were served warm and the pulled pork tacos were much better then expected. Save room for desert as well."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Maybe it's because Jake's is a refurbished country filling station with an out-the-door line at peak times.  Maybe it's their quirky menu that is so out of step with my expectations  (e.g. venison quesadillia?!).  But, I think it's because they cook their food so damn well.    Jake's is a true anomaly with offerings unique enough to say, \"oh, yea, gotta try that\" and with prices just high enough to keep it from becoming a dive.  Did I say I like this place?  Yep."}
{"text":"Jakes is our go to place for dinner. Try the BB Q chicken with Mac cheese. To die for."}
{"text":"Been to Jake's initially from a Groupon and have returned several times for dinner. The food is typically WONDERFUL... they obviously have a real chef.  Tried 2 desserts and nothing as great as their entrees. The service is usually friendly but far from being as impressive as the food.   It's in an old gas station and the only A/C is from a window unit which made dining at our table nothing short of physically miserable and the waitress was too busy to care...or maybe she just didn't care. Overall, we'll be back for sure and will be aware of what we will get and what we won't get."}
{"text":"Not eating here again. I got stuck in a corner and basically forgot about. Whenever the waitress did come by with the food or drink, it was a quick set it down and run off. No interaction, not friendly at all. The food was pretty good but horrible service."}
{"text":"With family in Albermarle, I have seen Jake's many times and knew it was on Triple D many years ago; however I had never dined there.  We went on a Saturday night which also happened to be the last weekend a Groupon would be valid, so everyone else had the same idea.  We were told the wait time would be an hour and forty-five minutes to two hours.  We sat in the bar/counter/lobby area and drank beer which you grab out of a  Coke cooler.  Our wait time ended up being only an hour and five minutes which was not bad.    We knew what wanted so we ordered immediately.  The fried green tomatoes were lightly fried and delicious.  The amount of batter was not overbearing.  I had the free range chicken served with mac and cheese and broccolini.  I was expecting southern style mac and cheese but it the noodles were not macaroni but penne pasta.  It was different but good; however I would have preferred real macaroni.    The wife got salmon served with asparagus and risotto and she liked that.  The service was rushed but so were we and that was understandable.  Jake's is a cool place in an old gas station serving decent food.  Some of it seems slightly overpriced, but the Groupon made it reasonable.  Most of the workers were friendly although were extremely busy.  I would return.  Oh, I really like paying at the front after the meal too.  This prevents servers from walking away with my card and also frees them up to do what they need to do."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything and Jake did not make a very good one.  It sounded good and apparently many people think so otherwise we would not have waited 30 minutes for a table. We ordered the Scallops for an appetizer. You only get 3 or 4 scallops, though they are big. I ordred the wings, but I can't review them since they were out of them?!  Well thats okay I was looking forward to the biscuits, but I can't review those either because...they were OUT of them. Well we said at least we'll have room for dessert, but guess what?  Yep. OUT (all 10 of them)!  I got the pork chop for my entre with a \"Dollop\" of mashed potatoes. The pork chop was presented well surrounded by lots of white plate.  This is a good meal for maybe a first date where you don't want to eat too much or perhaps anorexics.   This place is going to be on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I'm sure it will look awesome on TV, but I won't be back.  Oh and they did have dessert. A big healthy portion of \"Check\""}
{"text":"Outstanding place. Love the unique atmosphere.  My wife and I enjoyed dinner and almost \"inhaled\" their baked pork chops... juicy and wonderful flavor. Then came dessert....real banana pudding and coconut chess pie! !!!!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! If someone tries to drag you here, resist as hard as you can. It's not worth the diarrhea!"}
{"text":"This place is just so-so. The only two side choices they had with their sandwiches were homemade chips or pasta salad.  I got the pasta salad and thought it had way too much dressing. The artichokes in it were also too hard. The parking lot in this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. I was afraid I damaged my car because there was a steep hole that I drove through because I didn't see it. They need to fill in some of the hole with grav"}
{"text":"Had an awesome BLT today!  and great banana pudding.  This is a frequent lunch spot for me - love the servers and the facility - in an old service station.  Food is always good!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite place to eat. We have never had anything that we didn't like. The fried green tomatoes and fried oysters are to die for. The barbecue chicken with white cheddar mac and cheese is scrum-diddly-umptious!"}
{"text":"After seeing Jake's Good Eats featured on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and  Dives\", I knew I would have to check it out (especially since it's located within a 10 minute drive of my house).  After months of mentioning it to my wife, I finally convinced her to go to dinner there last night.  Jake's Good Eats is located in a building that was originally built as a Gulf filling station in 1929.  The restaurant opened in 2008 and has quite a loyal following, especially among local residents.  Much of the original structure of the building is still in use, and the restaurant's decor is perfectly accented to give diners the feeling of going back in time.  The menu is a blend of old Southern and new Southern cuisine, with such offerings as fried green tomatoes and crawfish/shrimp etouffee.  Their most well-known items are the venison quesadilla appetizer and maple-glazed pork chop entree.  Entrees are served after 5pm, while the lunch menu is available all day.  Entrees range from $8 for a vegetable plate to $23 for a New York strip steak, while lunch items are priced from $4 to $9.  My wife and I decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip.  The dip itself was not too heavy or rich, and the spinach was very fresh!  The homemade tortilla chips were absolutely delicious, and both my wife and I concluded that we could have made an appetizer on just the chips alone.  We both decided to order from the lunch menu on this visit.  I went with the BBQ plate with white slaw and homemade chips, while Heather ordered the cheeseburger \"all the way\" with chili, mustard, and onions.  (Slaw is also available, but she requested no slaw).  My wife kept on saying \"Mmmmm, that's good!\" with each bite of her cheeseburger, so I'm going to guess that she liked her meal.  The BBQ plate -- -chopped pork with an Eastern Carolina style vinegar sauce -- was excellent in flavor.  There was not very much smoke in it, but I did not expect there to be much smoke.  The slaw was very fresh and not overly heavy, a perfect complement with the pork.  We also splurged for dessert.  I ordered the banana pudding, and she ordered a slice of chocolate and almond butter mousse pie.  In one word: WOW!  Both desserts were very rich and delightful.  I started out with the banana pudding, and Heather had the pie.  About halfway through, we ended up switching desserts.  Either way, it was a winning proposition.  If I had one complaint to make about Jake's Good Eats, it's that there were several flies in the dining room that kept irritating us throughout our meal.  As we were walking out to the car, my wife turned to me and said, \"You did a bad thing, Wayne, by showing me this place.\"  That pretty much sums up our feelings on Jake's Good Eats, as we will definitely be returning to dine here again.  Jake's Good Eats is located at 12721 Albemarle Rd., Charlotte, NC 28227.  Their hours are from Tuesday thru Thursday from 11am until 9pm.  On Friday and Saturday, they are open from 11am until 2:30pm and from 5pm until 9pm.  Their website is http://www.jakesgoodeats.com.

{"text":"Pretty good food, I may be downgrading because I went withn a fish special instead of the pork chop like I really wanted, my problem not theirs.  The fried oysters were really good."}
{"text":"While I had expectations of having a great experience,  I was sadly let down. Went with two girlfriends and my 8 year old son yesterday (Saturday night at 6pm) for dinner. The restaurant is cute and kitschy, it was not crowded,  and we were seated right away. However,  we waited almost 45 minutes for our food  We had the fried green tomatoes and they were hard,  crunchy and salty.  You couldn't even taste the tomatoes. The balsamic wad good,  but there was not nearly enough.  And the \"bed of leeks\" was a small pile on the edge of the plate the size of a quarter.  Not even one bites worth!   One friend ordered the scallop appetizer for her main dish and said they were tasty. But she only got three of them for $12! My other friend got the bbq chicken. She was told it would be 1/2 of a chicken,  yet it was the size of a small chicken breast.  When she asked the server she was told it was a free range chicken and they run small. It was served overt a large helping of mac n cheese which she stated was bland.  I got the pork roast. It was delicious!  A large portion served with collards and sweet potatoes.  Everything was great! Especially the cherry glaze!  While there was no children's menu,  they made a grilled cheese sandwich for my son.  He wanted fries but we were told that it came with chips and there were no substitutions. The chips were homeade and good,  but very hard and tough for a small child. He wouldn't eat them.   Overall,  50% of the food was good. The wait was terrible. And it was expensive! My bill alone was $38 before tip-and that was for one dinner,  one kids meal,  a diet coke and chocolate milk!   We won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time on a Tuesday evening for dinner. When my date and I entered we had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated - there were maybe 7 total people dining in the whole restaurant.  My date and I ordered drinks and the highly recommended venison quesadillas (from the Food Network) as an appetizer. The appetizer was \"meh\" - nothing that I wouldn't expect to get from a basic chain restaurant (if they served venison) and the venison had a spongy texture to it. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I kind of wished we had tried the fried green tomatoes instead.  For our entrées my date ordered the vegetarian dish and I ordered the the barbecue chicken dish - I also substituted risotto for the mac and cheese that it normally comes with. We waited for our food for quite some time. My entrée (the barbecue chicken) was mediocre. The risotto was undercooked - al dente risotto does not mean it should be \"crunchy\". I expected the barbecue chicken to be fully marinated in barbecue sauce, however it looked like it was boiled chicken with some barbecue sauce just drizzled on top of the chicken - it wasn't very flavorful. My dates dish - the vegetarian cheese tortellini with various vegetables in a cream sauce - was relatively tasty. I sort of wished again that I had ordered that.  Overall for the quality and taste of the food here - I find this restaurant to be extremely overpriced. I've heard good things about their lunches and I might return to try a lunch dish - but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. More than likely I'll never return for dinner based on my experience. Huge Food Network fail."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, interesting atmosphere.  It seems like nobody knew how to dress here because there was a guy in a bow tie at one table and a kid in a tie-dye wife beater at another.  Definitely not an upscale place.  You can tell it used to be a gas station.  However, the food was phenomenal.  I had the special which was tuna with eggplant ratatouille and fresh spinach.  The food was definitely better than some more expensive and classier looking places in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is out in the middle of nowhere... We'll sort of. I found it a few years ago while hunting down Diners Drive ins and Dive places. This one lives up to the shows reputation as crazy good food and interesting lineage.  Everything from atmosphere to service to food items is just great. Comfy down home comfort food and friendly home town feel is the subtext of this fantastic eatery.  I will visit every chance I get and if you are in the Charlotte area it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I. Love. Jakes.  Literary everytime I'm in town I come here. It's fresh homemade food and it does not get any better. I've had just a bout everything on the menu. The pork chop is to die for. The food is always well prepared and the deserts especially the chocolate pie is a favorite  To someone that didn't like the tortilla chips, if want bagged chips and canned dip go to Applebee's. Jakes home made tortillas are awesome. Crunchy outside and soft inside. From the first time I tried them I was amazed. If you don't like the food here you've been eating processed garbage too long.   Keep it up Jake!  I think DDD needs to come back for a redux episode."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove from York, SC to eat at Jake's Good Eats and waited an hour on a Saturday evening to have dinner. The maple glazed pork chop with apples, garlic mashed potatoes and bacon braised spinach was proclaimed \"the best pork chop I've ever tasted\" by my husband. I thought it was descent. The blackened Flounder over grit cakes with mixed vegetables was his meal and I thought the grit cakes had too much sage but I ate every bite of his summer squash medley. We had the cornmeal crusted oysters as appetizer-every bit as good as advertised; and the chocolate cheesecake for dessert- good but more like chocolate pie with only a vague hint of cheesecake flavor.   For the time invested and food items that we ordered I'm sorry to say only the oysters lived up to the hype. The service was sufficient but not gracious. I would eat there again as I usually give places a second chance. I'll let you know if next time is better."}
{"text":"This was one if the most satisfying lunch meals I've had the pleasure of enjoying in quite a while. The flounder sandwich served upon a high end whole wheat bread was fried expertly and served with lettuce, thinly sliced tomato and homemade tartar sauce. It was crisp and juicy! The home made  chips and blue cheese to dip them in were scrumptious. The young waitresses were so polite and great at their job!!! Do yourself a favor stop by for lunch or dinner. Oh yes the fried green tomatoes were some of the best!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Large serving. Mason jars for drinks. Good service. Decent variety on menu."}
{"text":"Best pork chop I've ever had. Amazing fried green tomatoes and venison quesadilla . Favorite place when I want a great meal close by."}
{"text":"I've had the grilled chicken sandwich and the meat loaf sandwich and both are great. The setting is very informal and country. The meat loaf tastes like it was homemade and I advise you dip it in ketchup! A great experience with wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of parting with cash at this place. I stopped by because it was on Guy Feirri's show Diners, Dives and Drive Ins. It looked likely find of place. A nice rustic converted gas station. But then I got the menu and the descriptions horrified me. It was all froo, froo California fare. The more the girl described the specials the more my palate and brain cringed. The combinations sounded terrible. So I pulled the trigger and said \"Hey why not try the Venison Quesadillas. They can't mess that up, right?\"  Well they did. It cost me $16 and it was the most bland quesadilla I've ever had. I asked the waitress what the smear on the plate was and she said\"It's pepper jelly! Try it!\" Unfortunately I did. Gross. Clash of the palate! She swung by and asked if I was finished and then grabbed the plate from me without listening to my protest as I was trying to wash the taste of that abomination from my mouth with the lettuce. When I cashed out the other brainless employee asked about my meal and I told her that it was buzzard and some things should never be put together. She was clueless. So I told her that the food tasted like California. To which she responded, \"Great!\" \"Nope, that was not a compliment. It means that you wrung all of the flavor and life out of the food and had the audacity to not only serve it but charge me double.\" Evidently the staff does not know how to respond properly to guests feedback. It's a real shame that I had to drop by a Wendy's to get as frosty to cleanse my palate of the glue taste from the appetizer. My $5 chicken combo tasted better that the venison. For shame! You have been warned about this place. Don't say I didn't warn you. ddc"}
{"text":"So....My BF and decided to venture out to Jake's after seeing it on DDD and reading reviews. Yeah, uh no. We went on a Saturday 3/15 at 6pm. They were open from 5-9pm. Our wait was an hour. The place is small, with no waiting area inside so we joined the other 25 or so people waiting outside.   The service: Our server came quick, took drink orders and disappeared. When she returned with the drinks we were very ready to order. She brought our app (spinach dip) quick. She then informed us they were out of 5 or so items on the menu. And asked if we wanted to reserve dessert since it would soon sell out. We did. We placed our dinner orders and that's when it all went down hill! We waited 35 minutes for our entrees. OMG! Seriously. Our server NEVER came back, never gave an update, never refilled drinks. A young couple sat across from us, they ordered (I'll get back to this shortly).   The food: The spinach dip and homemade chips were great! The dip was fresh, hot and heavy on the spinach. The tortilla chips were flour, not corn. Different but good. My BF got the Fried seafood platter sans oysters, extra shrimp. The breading was insanely good! He inhaled his food. Homemade tartar and cocktail sauce were a nice touch. My meal was a different story. I opted for the server recommended BBQ chicken with mac n cheese and broccolini. EPIC FAIL!!!! The chicken looked and tastesd boiled..not grilled, baked, seared, broiled....BOILED. It was topped with a lack luster \"chicken BBQ sauce\" whatever that means. It arrived sitting on a full bowl of penne pasta with a white cheddar sauce (no flavor at all) and was garnished with 3 lonely unseasoned pieces of broccolini. So....I sent it back and ordered what my BF had.  Back to the service....  The service cont: While waiting for my second entree we noticed the table across from us had no food, at all! Not an app, not bread, a fry, nothing. The empty beer bottle they had was still sitting at the end of the table, hence no service. At the same time one of the two older women at the hostess stand began to shout that they were \"running out of food\" to all the patrons who hadn't been seated. She continued to say  \"We no longer have anything fried (out of breader), we have 4 steaks left. No crab cakes, no BLT, No chicken sandwiches, no desserts.\" WTH?!!!!! There were at least 20 people waiting for tables. She began to take orders in advance and try to secure food. I was told I got the last fried platter. As the waiting crowd shrank so did the food in stock. It was a sad sight.  When our server came by (still no update on my new entree) I asked if she secured our desserts...she responded with a blank stare. I also mentioned feeling bad for the couple across from us, as they had been sitting for over an hour with no food.   Final thoughts: All in all, the place is neat. Kitchy and different. The service suffers due to young staff. The fried food is amazing (if they have it) and the wait is insane. We won't be going back, but it was nice to say we had the \"experience\"."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal here.  I tried something different and went with the blackened flounder over grit cake. yum!  My wife had one of her favorites,  pulled pork.  So good we bought a pound to go. We highly recommend this casual fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Came here since we are visiting my folks in town. My mom kept raving about it, so we came here for lunch. The food was so good! It's the southern comfort food I've been missing ever since I moved up north!   For starters we had the fried oysters, and the fried green tomatoes. The oysters were good, and the fried green tomatoes were amazing! I never thought a balsamic would go well with fried green tomatoes, but it was perfect. Delish!   For entrees, I had the bbq chicken with Mac & cheese. The chicken was so tender, the sauce was good- tangy and a little sweet. The Mac and cheese was sooooooo good. Creamy with perfectly cooked pasta, and not over done. My bf had the pulled pork which was also delicious. The pork was tender and moist.   For dessert we got the peach cobbler and banana pudding. Both were great!   I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place because we were passing through and it was on one of our favorite shows Diners, Drive-in and Dives, so we decided to take a detour. Must say that it was definitely worth it. The unique southern \"grandmas house\" feel makes you feel right at home. If you aren't looking for it you'd probably drive right past it since it looks like a gas station/ old house. My husband got the Glazed pork chops and fries (since we were there at lunch and they only make their mashed potatoes at night to keep them fresh) and my husband LOVED IT. The price was a little steep for a \"diner\" it was $23. I got the pulled pork with fries and it did not disappoint! ($8) also ordered the peach cobbler which was pretty good but not the best we've tasted. All in all the staff was super friendly and would recommend this if looking for a neat place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a very long time. My hubby and I ate at Jake's last night. At first glance, I was a little bit shocked at the prices of their entrees. For a supposed \"dive\" place, and locations, the entrees were priced pretty high. I ordered the meatloaf sandwich with homemade chips. What an amazing sandwich. It was so good. I loved it. Not to mention that their blue cheese was homemade (I dipped my chips in it). My husband ordered wings and they too were fantastic. Large wings, cooked with the right amount of crispiness. It's a very cute little restaurant in an old gas station. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Jake's def has some good eats!  We tried this place today with a Groupon....and already said we'd be back after only the appetizer!  To start Spinach dip....fresh homemade tortillas-soooo good!  Tons of flavor.  Next, wedge salads.  Delicious flavorful homemade blue cheese dressing!  Then, pork plate.  Was good, hubby loved the sauce, I loved the chips and homemade ranch!  Lastly, peach cobbler.  Hubby loved it, I like a more crunchy version.  Everything is and tastes super fresh and homemade!  Cute, small atmosphere.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Time to write an (accurate) review after 5 meals here... Jake's doesn't look like much from the outside but the quality of food and service has been very consistent and keeps us coming back!  We have enjoyed everything we have ordered; venison quesadilla, firecracker shrimp, shrimp po'boy, fried flounder (can get it blackened too!), BBQ and etoufee.  I don't understand some of the negative reviews; the parking area is fine (although not paved) and spacious enough and there is no \"froo froo California fare\" here.  They regularly have \"specials\"; each we ordered has been great and when in doubt just request what Guy Fieri ordered. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"They've got fresh specials every day, and the prices are really reasonable. There aren't a lot of interesting places to eat in this part of town, which is pretty near where I live. I was excited when I heard about this place, and it hasn't let me down yet.   I love the garlic mashed potatoes, and I've had wonderful experiences with the desserts as well. I really enjoyed the lemon squares that Alyson J. didn't like.   The prices are really good, and I like the laid-back scene. It's a little off the beaten path if you live uptown, but it's not as far as you might imagine. It's worth the trip out."}
{"text":"Had the Cobia blackened fish sandwich special. Fish was good but did not really care for the lemon sauce. Great shoe stings fries and service. Would certainly come back when In the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this was my third visit to this establishment.  The first time was fine; food and service were good.  The second visit, the food was good but the service was very slow.  After the third visit - NEVER again!  If I could give it less than 1 star, I would.  I bragged about the food at this place to my parents (who were visiting from out of town) so we went for lunch 4/23.  We were seated before anyone else (we arrived at the 11:00 opening).  I was truly embarrassed by the time we left.    SERVICE:  Slow.  We ordered two burgers and a chicken sandwich and did not see our food for 35 minutes!  People that were seated 10-20 minutes after us received their food before us and left before we did.   FOOD:  The fried green tomatoes appetizer we ordered had a long (8\" or more) dark brown hair under them.  I wanted to complain, but I did not see our waitress for 20 minutes after she dropped them off and she came and took my plate while I was in the restroom.  Also, my parents ordered the turkey burgers and received regular hamburgers, although the waitress insisted they were turkey after we questioned her.   STAFF:  Heather at the front needs to be disciplined and/or FIRED.  This employee has an extremely nasty attitude.  We questioned her about our Groupon (which does not disclose ALL of the rules in the fine print) and she was very rude.  She told us to \"go talk to Groupon about it\" and that \"it's not my problem\".  Actually, the restaurant sets the rules and limits with Groupon, so it IS their problem.  Either way, it was her bad attitude makes me never want to come back here again.  She was nasty to the lady ahead of us (about the same issue, we found out in the parking lot) and the couple two people ahead of her (yeah, the line to get out of this place was that long).  I think the novelty of DDD has worn off, and we're seeing what this place is truly like."}
{"text":"I love stopping here! Homemade ketchup and sweet tea to die for! I love the turkey burger and the meatloaf sammach! Don't judge me! The chips are killer too!"}
{"text":"Great little place---very reasonably priced.  Salmon was best I've had in a long while. Came on top of a delicious fried potatoe cake with tomatoes and dill sauce.  Had pecan pie for dessert--outstanding. (Apparently the banana pudding is great too.) The hot homemade biscuits were just like grandmas. The only downside was they were reluctant to give us more than one biscuit. Not sure why. Overall, I'll be back again but may need to bring back-up biscuits."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had wanted to try this place for a while so we finally decided to go for dinner on Thursday. We both loved the charm of this quaint little 80 year old gas station turned restaurant. Unfortunately that was the only thing we loved. It started after waiting 20 minutes to get seated, which in all fairness the place is small. Our server came by about 5 minutes after we were sat and was a very pleasant girl. She took our drink order and returned several minutes later. My wife's drink tasted funny so she asked for something else which seemed okay. I got the fried seafood platter and my wife got what the server recommended which was the maple pork chop and my son got a corn dog. It took roughly 30 minutes to get our food and when it arrived the server re-filled my wife and son's drink with water (which is not what they were drinking to begin with). The seafood platter was good especially the fish and the home made cocktail sauce was pretty decent but the fries were stone cold. My wife tried a fried oyster and like it so I tried a bite of her pork chop. The first bite was okay but when my wife cut into the other part of her pork chop I noticed she was having trouble cutting it. I thought she was trying to cut into the bone so I did not think much of it. After I was done with my food I looked to see my wife stopped eating and did not look happy. I asked to take another bite of here pork chop and when I did, I realized why she looked unhappy. The pork chop was way overcooked and I could barely chew it up. It took 2 sips of tea just to get it down. She then told me the potatoes taste powdery too which I believed her and did not try. My son begged for desert after his corn dog so he split a slice of peach pie with my wife. I tried a bite and was so-so. In the end I would of given at least two stars even after the drink mix up and the terrible pork chop BUT this was the deciding factor........Two sodas, one tea, pork chop dinner, fried seafood dinner, corn dog, and one slice peach pie....OVER $64.00 BEFORE GRATUITY.....OMG!!! We have eaten at upscale sushi restaurants and paid the same price. TOTALY not worth it! Needless to say we will never go back there again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken sandwich which was pretty good. It had tomatoes lettuce honey dijon and Applewood smoked bacon on it, with Texas toast as the buns. Service was impeccable, as always with Jake's. Food and service were good if not excellent, food got to the table fast and drink refills were quick, fast and aplenty, you seldom will have a empty glass. The dessert selection AND quality is good too."}
{"text":"Jakes is one of my favorite go to places to eat.  Tonight however was just ok.  I had the Shrimp and grits.  It was extremely salty and I almost sent it back. The spinach dip appetizer was just ok too.  The chips were greasy and the dip was a little dry.   My daughters chicken Cesar was average and nothing special.  My husbands Turkey burger was the best.  Wonder if they changed chefs."}
{"text":"We ate here the other night. There was no wait at 6:30 and we sat right away. Our server was very nice and did a great job, the food just was not very good.  The spinach dip appetizer was not what we expected. The menu said tortilla chips, but the chips were almost like fried pita bread or they use flour instead of corn tortillas. The chips were chewy and greasy. We almost wanted to ask the manager to come out and try some of the dish and see what he would say.   The fried fish plate was big, but somewhat on the salty side. The breading on the shrimp and oysters overpowered the flavor and texture of the seafood.   We were disappointed with the food and will not return."}
{"text":"I'm still in shock! We went for lunch today and had waited 25 minutes before our order was taken. The server said we looked busy talking? I thought all friends talked when they went to lunch! After another 40 minutes of waiting and tables around us being seated and served and still no food for us, we politely asked what the delay was. We were patronizingly told that because we ordered grilled chicken and not fried, it took longer.  Finally our food came. When paying at the counter my friend very nicely told this same lady that we felt like we were dismissed and if just an apology had been offered it would have helped, and that no matter how chicken salad was ordered, it didn't make sense that it would've taken so long. The employee lost it and told us so loudly that we were embarrassed , \"GET OUT OF HERE!\"..We literally were kicked out of the restaurant! The people in line to pay were embarrassed for us. it was such an awful experience and even thought the food was decent, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Restaurant is ok at best. Our daughter loves salmon, which comes with risotto. When we ask to substitute to mac and cheese we were told it would be an additional  $5 charge?? Also the menu is fairly limited and expensive. We went on \"Taco Tuesday\" night, but we're told we couldn't order tacos because they weren't ready. It was 5:40. I suspect their constant use of Living Social deals implies they aren't doing too well."}
{"text":"Had the pork chop with horseradish mashed potatoes...so amazing!! The best chocolate cake for desert!!  Had a great experience at Jake's!! Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Took my family for lunch. It's over rated. Nothing special and the cashier was a smarty pants. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Delicious green fried tomatoes. Cozy, family-friendly atmosphere. Delicious homemade salad dressings! Fresh food. A new favorite  :-)"}
{"text":"Good food.  Good people.  Great pork chop- get the pork chop every time"}
{"text":"My husband brought our son & I here because it was on diners, drive ins & dives. When we arrived there was an older lady behind the counter that looked at us but didn't say a word to us. I was under the impression she was the owner, but later found out she's the owners aunt - either way take a moment to open your mouth and say hi when staring. About 4 minutes later a waitress finally came out and sat us. We then had about 20 minutes to look over the menu as she busily ran around the place ... Not assisting a single patron. She was the most unfriendly waitress I've ever dealt with, no personality at all. Husband got po boy-wasn't impressed, son got pulled pork-dry and tasteless, I got pear spinach salad-too much pickled dressing, got horrible heart burn. The prices were not worth the food - my husband advised he'd eaten there before & wasn't too impressed, and now after they were on food network they have this idea their food is amazing or something (bleck). I guess we could have dealt with food but that on top of the old lady's judgemental holier than thou attitude & the horrible service by our \"server/waitress\" we'll never return. Sadly I heard how great the cook/owner is - too bad he's to focused on cooking than the insulting service being given to his customers beyond the kitchen doors."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and have been back twice.  Once just myself and my fiance and it was a pretty good experience.  Food was good and service was great.  Definitely seemed to be either locals who are like family, people using the Groupon or people who heard about it on the Diner, Drive-in's and Dives show.  Second time we brought family and had a group of 8.  Service was sub par and two of our orders were wrong but they were extremely busy (about a 30 minute wait or so).  It's pretty close so I'm sure we'll be back and will update the review."}
{"text":"Love all the food.  Great service, great prices, great value.  One of the very best lunches in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I have driven past Jake's and had no idea that it was even a restaurant.  It looks like an old gas station.  Probably one that wasn't even in business, or maybe not even open, since there a no pumps.  But they are.  According to reviews, they've been open for at least a couple of years now.  Interesting.  Whatever the case, they do seem to have a dedicated following - so you'll want to get there somewhat early.  We pulled in around 5pm and the place was a ghost town.  By 6 or so, it was almost full.  Consider yourself warned.  Service was good all around, from the start to the finish.  That's definitely their strong suit.  Unfortunately the food doesn't quite live up to the homey feel of the restaurant or the friendly service provided.  We started on the venison quesadilla.  It was actually really good.  Where venison can sometimes be gamey or even tough, here it worked, and the flavors were excellent.  My wife, who doesn't typically like venison - both for flavor and because it is eating Bambi - enjoyed it.  Though not enough to eat her entire portion, so I was able to finish hers.  Sweet.  Then she had a salad wedge.  I've never been a huge fan of the wedge, because it means you get a head of lettuce and cut it into quarters (or some other section).  Come on - chop it up.  Wedges are a cop out.  But she seemed to enjoy it.  For dinner, she had a flounder sandwich and I had a blackened flounder plate with grit cake.  She enjoyed the sandwich.  My blackened flounder had next to no flavor.  The grit cake wasn't bad, but had a really strange consistency.  Instead of being a cake, it had a very thick outside and an almost runny inside.  Then there was a mixed mess of veggies on the plate, which was probably the best thing that I had.  We also had a blueberry cheesecake thing for dessert.  Not bad, but not overly impressive.  It's like a no-bake cheesecake in a graham cracker pie shell.  I'm sure their ingredients were fresher, but about anyone could do something similar in their kitchen in a short amount of time.  Though I didn't have a sandwich, I'm thinking that's the strong suit here.  Of note: They have custom-painted cornhole decks out front, with the initials \"EEK\" on them.  I'm wondering if they were done by Erin K. (who has the eek.yelp.com domain).  Erin - is that you?  Sweet Tea Report: The sweet tea was nicely sweet and quite drinkable, and served in glasses that looked like old mason jars.  Cute."}
{"text":"Under assuming in appearance, but overwhelming in food quality and flavor. Servers were genuinely gracious and attentive. Definitely a \"do-over\" and look forward to sharing with visiting family and friends!"}
{"text":"Oh my God, I'm going to get so fat. I'm going to be so fat. The food is absolutely scrumptious. For reals try the fried green tomatoes and the houser sandwich, you won't be disappointed. I have it on good authority that the desserts are pretty epic, but I had no room, so next time."}
{"text":"I didn't find it all that special. My tuna salad was salty. The fried green tomatoes were thin and fried to death. Maybe I'll try again but I'm not in a hurry"}
{"text":"Guy Fieri strikes out again (and no one looks shocked)...I've only been to 2 restaurants he's featured that I liked (and one of them isn't even under the same ownership anymore). Sadly, Jake's Good Eats is not one of them.  I'm not the biggest fan of Southern food, I'll put that out there. Something Savannah style, I'll entertain. But \"traditional\" Southern, not my thing. And Jake's is VERY Southern. It has a very country-home vibe (I half expected lace doilies on the table). Lots of people dig it...not my thing. That said, I attempted to maintain my journalistic integrity and remain as objective as possible.  Lots of expected things on the menu: fried fish and oysters, fried green tomatoes, pork barbeque. Quality is very hit-or-miss. The fried green tomatoes were \"eh.\" I got the oyster po' boy. It was heavy on the lettuce and the oysters were on the bland side. I found myself reaching for the S and P at the table...oh noes.  What they do execute well, however, is service. Everyone was gracious and attentive and managed their busy rush well.  Which is a final point: due to \"Diners,\" they are slammed. I'm fine with busy establishments (especially when they handle the traffic well, which Jake's does). But the parking situation...you'll need a drink by the time you've managed to find a space after backing up and turning around in their tiny, awkwardly-shaped gravel lot several dozen times without backing into someone.   Give it a try to say you've tried it (especially if Southern food is your thing). But don't look for me there."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Don't waste your time, horrible/poor service...   Lets just say we showed up at 6:20 pm and told they were running behind and we would have to wait a bit for food, which ok, we drove all this way we can wait no biggy. We set up our \"own table\", sat and waited. Twenty minutes passed, we watched the waitress serve two other tables, refill drinks and polish silver ware.  The whole time we sat parched with no service and treated as unwanted guests.  After seeing the waitress giggle with her co-worker numerous times as we sat unattended, we finally had enough of the poor service and walked out the door. I am sure they didn't care and were rather happy that we left because it was one less paying customer to deal with.  That will be the first and last time we ever try Jake's especially with my out of town family members, thanks for the great story that we can tell over and over again."}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger. I loved the feel and atmosphere. The cheeseburger prepared \"all the way\" with mustard, onions, and chili was awesome. It's hard to find good chili, but theirs was top notch.   The freshly made potato chips were hit or miss. Some were soggy and some were perfectly crispy.   Some people have commented on the service. It was a busy day when we were there and we had about a 10 minute wait. Despite this the server was attentive and we never felt like we were waiting around for anything."}
{"text":"My Wife and I went to Jake's last night.  Could not have been happier with the staff and the food.  She had crab cakes and I had the pork chop.  As a side, we had fried oysters.  Everything was just outstanding as always.  Highly recommend the place.  It is very quaint, but the experience is fantastic."}
{"text":"First time here and was greeted by friendly people and seated immediately.  Ordered the Pan Fried Scallops that are made fresh to order on a bed of fresh spinach.  Melt in your mouth  yummy!  Following that with a hot dog  and chili.  Felt at home and treated like family.  What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Jakes scores high marks from me because it is a locally owned eating establishment oozing with character.  That alone makes it fairly unique for this area.  I have been for lunch half a dozen times and the food has always been fair to really good.  They do offer daily specials (I had the cheese-steak sandwich recently), however, the lunch menu could use little updating.  The deserts have always been top notch..specifically the banana pudding and the blueberry cake.  I have not been during dinner, so I cannot comment on those items.  Overall, Jakes is a place I look forward to stopping by when I'm in the area and my kids love the place."}
{"text":"Wow!  Like two different restaurants...  Been here several times, in part because I live close by and in part because of the press and national recognition.  The food is always very good.  Never, ever had a problem, good front of the house, good service, good food, served timely.  Tonight was different, the girl that was working the front of the house was very short, snippy, not so nice and in general, nasty.  I asked her a couple of things and I'm not sure I ever heard the answer but it was clear she was having a bad day.  As for the rest of the dining experience, great server and good food.  I was in the hospitality industry and if I know one thing, it's that the front of the house is the face of your business, the first face you see and in Jake's case, the last face you see.  It's so important that they be nice and accommodating and she was neither.  I don't know if she had a bad or what but your don't bring it to work.  I would put her somewhere that she would be more useful, away from people or elsewhere.  I have a Groupon that I purchased prior to this experience that I will use but that will likely be my last time there.  It's terrible that patrons feel like they should walk on eggshells to check in and check out.  Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Back to Jake's Good Eats for 2nd experience (with Groupon to boot!). Emailed earlier in the week and learned Valentine's Day had no special hours, and (still) no reservations, so the hubs and I headed out early. We got there 10 minutes before opening--and already a line! (No real surprise) Door finally opens at 5:05 and everyone makes their way inside. Naturally we just missed the 1st dining room seating, but were first for the 2nd round! 1-1.5 hour wait, still no biggie... it was early, right? So to pass the time, we splurged with each a glass of wine, amongst the crazy crowded 4-seater, 20+ standing room only bar area. After all it was Valentine's Day! Well, a full 1 hour 15 minutes later we finally get a table! Woo Hoo! So, we decided on our order and the waitress took the order, but when shown the Groupon she stated she didn't think Jake would accept Groupon because of Valentine's Day. At this point, I was ready to leave! Nothing on the Groupon indicated there would be any exceptions, and I am familiar with those---always playing by the rules. Undoubtably Mr. Stegall makes up his own rules, however... and it was confirmed that he would not honor the Groupon. Well, after at least 1.5 + hour wait time, my husband was not going to leave. He knew how much I had looked forward to returning to Jake's Good Eats and was not wanting to disappoint me. So we stayed. He ordered the Seafood Platter and I ordered the bacon-wrapped-crab-stuffed NC rainbow trout (with garlic mashed potatoes and pico). Patiently we waited another half hour, and the food finally arrived. By then we were hungry, but let me tell you, my husbands flounder was more like glorified fish sticks (didn't even LOOK like fish---literally were fish sticks!); the shrimp were great, and the fries were straight from the McDonald's play book! My rainbow trout was not bad, but the crab meat was nearly invisible, the bacon was mostly raw, and the potatoes had no flavor at all (what happened with the garlic?) Still we ate, without complaint or making a scene. So to the register we go... another wait (surprise surprise!) No one in site to take our cash. But, again... we do the right thing and wait patiently. It  did give us the opportunity to speak to another couple, waiting to pay... who asked if this was our first time. We admitted was our 2nd, and very disappointing--compared to the first visit.. They - in turn - didn't seem impressed and most likely won't be back for a 2nd visit. As for us, there won't be a 3rd visit. It truly makes me sick to my stomach that the Valentine's dinner I had so looked forward to was so disappointing, in so many ways. Oh... with tip we wound up spending 85 hard earned dollars. No doubt they will be the last ones spent at Jake's Good Eats by our family."}
{"text":"Came here since we heard about it on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives\" and we had a couple of people actually recommend it.  We felt sick afterwards.  The chicken wings were ok as a starter, but the fried flounder sandwich is what I think did it.  The tarter sauce wasn't good.  The pasta salad was not either...maybe their mayo just went bad.  The vinegar slaw was nothing special.  The service was good but this place was a little too dirty for us.  It was a one and done, probably won't come again."}
{"text":"By far, one of my favorite restaurants to go to. The wing sauce is perfect, scallops app fried in bacon oil and the steak entree are exceptional, and a great cheeseburger! Pretty cool this place is the closest restaurant to my house."}
{"text":"I tried Jakes for the first time last week and i liked it so much, i returned on saturday. Both times i visited i had the cheese burger all the way. Let me tell you, those burgers were out of this world. A messy masterpiece! I will most likely drop by again and try something new...but then again why mess with perfection lol. Oh, we also tried the banana pudding. It was delicious! It was warm which is something I'm not used to but it flowed perfectly. If you're ever in the area check out Jakes."}
{"text":"Went to Jake's tonight with my husband. Would love to be able to say if Jake's eats are good or not.....but I can't. We waited 45 minutes for a table. We ordered immediately after we were seated and 45 minutes later we still did not have any food. We got up to leave, only to have the older lady look at us and say \"Oh you haven't  eaten yet?\" No, no we had not eaten. Starving and angry that we had wasted not only an hour and a half trying to get food, but that we had wasted an hour getting there and still had an hour to drive back home.....with empty stomachs. I will not ever go back. Absolute waste of time."}
{"text":"I live within three miles of this place and have been thrilled in the past.  Imho they are resting on their laurels and publicity.  Our last visit we waited forever for a table and by the time our food finally came 3 of our party of 6 had their foreheads on the table, having achieved \"eat or kill\" status and needing to withdraw from society.  My husband's fish tasted like it was doused in kerosene and set ablaze.   Nothing but fuel taste.  It was a Thursday and the service was terrible and they were out of half the stuff.  We ate our meal in silence, so starving none of us were fit company.   Paid the bill which was over $100, and drove off wishing we'd just gone to Burger King.   It's going to be a while before we try one last time."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for the first time and had seen the DDD segment on this place so I had to check it out (on a Friday get there before 5 because it begins to fill up quickly).    The first thing that impressed me was the service and the friendly staff.  I can't remember a time where I had such great service at any restaurant.  For example, I had a glass of iced tea and left the table to make a call and by the time I returned 2 minutes later they had topped it off -- even though they were busy.    This was the first time I had tried fried green tomatoes and found them to be addictive.  Their special was Ahi Tuna with wasabi sauce, mashed potatoes with asparagus which turned out to be remarkable.   This place is unique in that you experience top-notch food with such an eclectic atmosphere where authentic shop rags are used for napkins -- minus the oil stains.    Loved the food and loved the staff.  I just wish they had one here in Virginia because I'd be there every week."}
{"text":"The food was satisfactory if you have had southern food before but compared to other restaurants I would not say it stands out. The service was also satisfactory for the waiters but the manager was just rude. After telling her how displeased we were with her attitude, she told us \"You can choose to NOT come back if you choose to do that\", in other words , she told us not to come back if we did not like how she treated us. After telling her how we felt we deserved an apology she said \"I am sorry if you feel that way but I have been doing this for 8 years and I treat everyone the same, I will only apologize for how you feel not how I treated you. \"This conversation is finish\".  But she did not treat everyone the same. Some people were told there was no room in the restaurant for the rest of the night and some people were seated. I do not know if this was racism or just a dislike for the people who entered before the white family but IT WAS UNFAIR. We returned our other Groupon voucher that we purchased and we will not be going back. We will try to get in contact with Jake from good eats before going to tell our Food Network associates."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, it takes a lot in order for me to leave a 5-star rating.  I can without a doubt that Jakes Good Eat's deserve's 5-stars plus a few more. My husband and I stumbled across JGE via an old episode of DDD. We live in Noda and JGE is not in our general vicinity of Friday night go-to spots. In other words it's kind of out there (Harrisburg or something like that), but oh was it worth the 20 min drive.   The view: When we pulled up we were greeted by  beautiful horses in the pasture behind the restaurant. Ummm can you say romantic?? The restaurant was pretty busy but the hostess greeted us immediately.  She was super sweet and when she realized we had never been there, she gave us the low down on how to order a beer (additional details to come) and filled us in on the specials (Octopus ... Go figure).   The bar: When we ordered a beer from the hostess/bar tender she told us we could grab what we wanted out of the cooler. No lie, my husband and I thought she was kidding. Sure enough, we grabbed what we wanted out of the cooler, the hostess told us our server would add it to our bill, and we grabbed a seat in the Adirondack chairs outside.   While waiting for our table, we chatted up some other patrons waiting for their tables and before we knew it our table was ready.    The food: our waitress was phenomenal. She was sweet and made excellent dinner suggestions. We started off with the fried oysters. Oh Em Gee (OMG) where they tasty. Definitely recommend.  We then went with the Pork Chop and blackened fish (sorry can't remember what it was) with a jumbo grit cake. All I can say is WOW!! The pork chop was juicy and tender and the mashed potatoes and apples that came with it was beyond flavorful. Fish and grit (cakes) was to die for. I'm from he south and have never had a grit cake but will certainly look forward to ordering them in the future.   Not only was our waitress (and the food) spectacular but each person that came by our table was helpful in terms of answering questions and/or fulfilling request. We even (randomly) asked if anyone remembered the theme song to Andy Griffin (bc we were sitting in front of a photo of Barney Fife (sp??) and they totally helped us remember it!! How great is that?  Finally Heather the manager was a peach. Our experience as JGE was spectacular and even though we live NO WHERE near it, we will certainly be back. Thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place...it was on DDD. The best part of dinner was the croutons. BBQ chicken was dry. Pork chops (which was what ddd had) was dry. Mashed potatoes tasted instant. Very disappointed and won't be going back. Definitely overpriced considering the quality."}
{"text":"Great Stuff! Started with the Fried Green Tomatoes served on a bed of braised leeks with a balsamic reduction.  The tomatoes were sliced thin and seasoned and fried perfectly, the leeks and balsamic were a great compliment. Next up, the Wedge Salad,  Super fresh lettuce wedge, generous crumbled bacon and a garlic laced homemade blue cheese dressing.  Very Good. I had the Cheeseburger, \"All the way\", with sauteed onions, chili and slaw.  Our server told us that the burger was #15 in the Charlotte Magazine readers poll.  I would have thought they would finish higher.  Great burger, excellent chili on a toasted bun.  Outstanding.  (For all us Southern California transplants, very reminiscent of a \"Tommy's Burger\".)  Served with homemade chips that are probably the best I've had in Charlotte, with your choice of homemade dressings or ketchup.  I had the ranch which was very good. We were told by our server that all their desserts are made fresh daily.  We opted for the Peach Cobbler and were not disappointed. The service was friendly and efficient.  Can't wait to go back and try the dinner entrees."}
{"text":"A colleague of mine tried to take me to Jake's a couple months back.  I talked him into Pinky's North.  (Which was a disappointment)  Well, we did finally got to Jake's for lunch and it was awesome.  When you walk in, the greeting isn't overwhelming and there isn't a sense of urgency by the staff but...it's not bad either.  Once we were seated the server was not exceptionally warm but wasn't unfriendly either.  (I know I sound wishy washy)  The burger and fries were very good. Cooked correctly.  The server warmed up as the meal progressed.    The place is cozy.  When we checked out (you pay at the front), the wait wasn't too long."}
{"text":"Eaten lunch here a few times with my wife. Interesting retro feel - the gas station, country store feel.  We usually start off with the fried green tomatoes, which are tasty. I've had the burger, which is fine - but I'm sold on the stuffed BLT. Plenty of bacon. Reasonably priced, too. I know there are bolder choices - but that's what we both normally get.  When it gets crowded, service can suffer - especially with only 1-2 on the floor. Overall, solid choice if you are in that area."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Jake's tonight and it was absolutely fantastic. We arrived around 6:30 and had a 30 minute wait. We sat at the front bar area and had a drink. Within 10 minutes, a crowd had descended upon the restaurant. After seating, our waitress immediately greeted us and took drink and appetizer(oysters) orders. The appetizer arrived quickly. Several tables were sat just before us and the kitchen was slammed. Please know going in that the place is very small, with a small kitchen, and it doesn't take much to cause a delay on orders. You will be rewarded, however, as the food is fantastic. Our server recommended our entrees, free range bbq chicken and the pork chop. Great suggestions to go along with the amazing oyster appetizer.  We took home a slice of pound cake and are enjoying it now. We will definitely be back and will highly recommend Jake's."}
{"text":"What a fun neat place to sit and eat! After getting a Groupon for Jake's we hit the place up and I nabbed a Shrimp and Oyster Po Boy. Let me tell you, the shrimp where big, and breaded deliciously. The Po Boy was huge and the bread was pretty amazing!  We also got the quesadillas with venison. Yum, the jalapeno jelly was a great touch. The overall staff was friendly and helpful. The decor was simple, mis/mash farm stuff. With the property backing up to a lil ranch you can see the horses out back.  I really enjoyed the food here and will be back!"}
{"text":"My whole family did not like. We had grilled chicken sandwiches, they didn't like the honey mustard. We had blackened flounder with grit cake, nothing special. My daughter ordered flounder sandwich, it came on cheap hamburger bread.Only thing I liked was their side pasta salad and my mixed veggies with my flounder. They need a better system to sit people, it was not organized. Hostess told us 30 minutes was more like 1 hour and 20 minutes! We are not a tough crowd to please either but this was a fail. Reason for 2 stars is only because we had a great server.Maybe my expectations were too high since I seen this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives."}
{"text":"Wow what a train wreck of a meal.... My mother and I are sick to our stomachs.   I luckily opted to stay home and have my parents bring me takeout. Dad paid $18 for slimy salmon... farm raised which mind you is only $5/lb. Mom had the oyster po'boy ..... it only had two oysters and all lettuce and mayo... she isn't feeling too hot.   Now for me... I ordered the wedge salad and the BBQ pork sandwich... wow was that bad... I took two bites and threw it away... I wouldn't even consider giving it to a dog... the pork truly tasted old and rancid... now the wedge... not that difficult of a salad to do... yet they screwed that up... forgot the bacon... the only thing that saved me meal was the blue cheese dressing... wtf... not sure where or how you have trained your palate and thinking this place is worth anything, I am not sure. But the thing I do know for sure is that my face will be hovering over the toilet to get rid of that vile pork!   Triple D.... this is the third place you've been to that I've tried and it blows!"}
{"text":"Diners drive in and dives introduced me to this place. I seen it about 2 weeks before i vacationed down south. literally the night before the same episode aired. i knew i had to go.  it was a toss up between this place, and BBQ King, which was also on triple D's.  Jake's is a cute lil restaurant run by two brothers who wanted to take their fav foods growing up and serve it there style. its located in an old gas station which gives it a unique look from the outside.  when you walk in, it literally seems like family is greeting you. when i got there it was empty, the only guests in there. which was perfect, because by the time i was leaving it started getting busy.   Its not a big place. maybe 15 tables at most. the service is great! server came over after we settled in and our drinks came out fast.  Now onto the food. oh man. they have a pretty decent menu considering how small the place is. a dinner menu which starts at 5, and a lunch menu with a full list of many sandwiches and such. for appetizers, my boyfriend and i ordered fried green tomatoes and fried oysters. i have never had either of them and boy were they awesome! the oysters literally melted in your mouth and the sauce that was served with it was a perfect compliment to the oyster. the fried green tomatoes were so lioght and crispy, exactly what i pictured it to be. SO GOOD!  Entree time. We ordered exactly what was featured on the episode. Blackened flounder with a crawfish sauce, served with a side of mixed fresh veggies, and a double porkchop with a maple glaze, apples and a side of mashed potatoes and spinach. this was by far one of the best porkchops i ever ate in my life, seriously. they serve it medium well, but i had mine medium. the flounder was cooked perfectly, the crawfish sauce was incredible! a nice little kick to it, not fishy at all. perfect combination. my porkchop was amazing. the maple glaze with the apples was on the money.  you would think after all that food, we'd be stuffed. Nope! we had to order dessert. they dont have a dessert menu, i guess its different every day, and they are made fresh every day so when they sell out its done. We ordered the chocolate cake. it didnt stand a chance once it hit the table. we were so pleased with it, we had to order another dessert, the blue berry cobbler. sooooooo freakin good! so moist and delicious and billions of blue berries.   this place is a gem! service is great, food is amazing, they constantly are refilling your drinks. wish i could go back!!!   ETA: completely forgot about our salads! we had a ceasar and a wedge. the ceasar was soooo good, and the wedge had a nice home made bleu cheese dressing with crispy bacon. do it!"}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good but each time I've been since, the quality has gone steadily downhill. This time, there were so many things wrong that it was overwhelming. All of us agreed that we won't be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been popular since appearing on the Food Network show, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\".    A couple of things to consider before heading here.  It sits outside of I-485.  The restaurant does not take reservations and if you are meeting a group there, your entire party must be there before being seated.  It's not a big place so I understand why they do this.  Why have empty tables when there are other people waiting to be seated.  The restaurant itself is in an old gas station and has gas station memorabilia inside and outside of the restaurant.    The staff was friendly here and will answer any questions you have on the menu.   The food is homey southern with an upscale twist.  I had the maple glazed pork chop which was sweet and savory.  And for desert they had a blueberry cobbler which was one of the best I've had.    This is definitely worth the trip outside the loop!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that we really enjoyed the first 90% of our experience.  The GOOD:  We were greeted/seated very quickly at 6:00 on Wednesday night. We started with the fried green tomato appetizer which we both really enjoyed. We asked to split the wedge salad and they brought it out on two plates which was great! We both really enjoyed the blue cheese dressing. My fiance had the veggie tortellini and really enjoyed it. The balsamic reduction really made the dish. I had the bacon wrapped crab stuffed trout which was excellent. The pico was very fresh and a nice contrast, there was spinach on top of the mashed potatoes that had a smoky flavor, really a nice touch. We didn't wait long for the food and the appetizer/salad/entrees were delivered with good timing. Even our check came quickly after we were done.  We were really excited as this place is very close to our home and there aren't a ton of other options nearby... and then...   The BAD: As we were getting up to pay (pay at the front), we overheard a server telling an adjacent table that the Groupon MUST be shown prior to sitting down. Since I was also taking advantage of a Groupon I felt like I had done something wrong. I gave the girl at the register our check and the coupon and she quickly typed the ticket into the register and then turned to us and in the nasty tone of all nasty tones said \"you're supposed to show that Groupon before you sit down, its in the rules, can't you see the rules?\"! I was a little caught off guard and explained that we had used Groupon a few times before at other places and it was never a problem. I asked why it was such a problem at Jakes? Her response was again just rude. She pointed to the ticket and said \"read the rules, you can't use this. Read the rules, its in the rules.\" At this point she was causing a scene in front of several waiting guests so I said fine and while getting out my wallet asked why it mattered, just out of curiosity.  I kept thinking to myself... Were they going to give us less food if they knew we had a Groupon? Her response was \"because its in the rules. Just give me it.\". She then proceeded to use the Groupon and acted like simple subtraction was going to be the death of her.   The RESULT: After a great experience we were already talking about when our next visit would be. After the checkout process and the lady with the worst attitude I've experienced  in a long time, we will not be returning. We really value the experience of dining out and its a shame that a bad attitude can completely ruin great food and service."}
{"text":"love this place... best place to eat in Mint Hill hands down... If you're a wing guy like me, eat the lemon Pepper wings... I'm pretty sure it's not on the menu but they will serve it to you.... They are the best wings on the planet..."}
