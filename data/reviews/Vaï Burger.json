{"text":"worst  service ever i  got  2  trios and  the   fries are  not even  cook wat  a bunch of  idiots"}
{"text":"Great food. Absolutely delicious. Only reason I removed two stars is the following:  Service can be slow. Takes time to get your order.   False advertising. All of their pictures on the menu show sandwiches that are not the same as what you receive. Example: the chicken burger shows that it has lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles in it. In reality, the burger only comes with lettuce.  You can't mislead your customers like this.  When I argue back with them that everything is missing, they say too bad that's how it is."}
{"text":"this place started with decent food quality but unfortunately the quality is dropped and it is so bad that i will never return to this place. I wish i could give the lower starts but there is nothing less available. You will go to this place only if you want to waste you money and ruin your mood. Sorry but unfortunately the worst experience that i ever had."}
{"text":"Super bon, super chaleureux, bon service!! Pas trop de bruit. Prix raisonnable pour la quantités et variété. Très interessant dû au nombre de variété. Cela est très originale!"}

{"text":"Went there with two of my buddies to eat and i took the django a mix of filet mignion and chicken and it was delicious. The service was great and ask for the spicy sauce its excellent and people were very friendly. The place was clean and even the back store was super clean ! I really recommend the place !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times in the past. They have large portions for their sandwiches (as long as you don't get their burgers). They have about ten different choices for their sandwiches. I usually get their Red Light - their combo arrives with fries and a drink. One thing I do love is their sauce they have for their fries. I refer to it as the spicy sauce and they know what I mean (not sure what it's called).  They're located near the metro and the many bus stations. I sometimes end up missing my bus because I underestimate the length of time it takes to prepare the sandwich. If you're in a rush, you can call in your order as it takes about 10-12 minutes to prepare a sandwich."}
{"text":"If you knew how many times I've walked by this restaurant and never gave it a second thought you'd laugh. So after reading lots of positive reviews i decided to give it a try...and I'm sold! I really enjoyed this corner spot restaurant pretty much contected to cote vertu metro.  The owner greeted us upon walking in and gladly explained all the dishes to us one by one. The thing that I read in other yelpers comments was a complaint about the time. Personally it took about 5 minutes to receive our dish, and that's great because i know they had to actually COOK my meat and not just heat it up. They had THE BEST FRIES...an exact replica of McDonalds, and the portions of fries were huge. They also have this amazing dipping sauce for your fries that had me licking the container once it was finished.  What did i eat? The IRON MAN sandwich, which was nicely spiced tandoori and Moroccan chicken smothered in cheese. This sandwhich is a definite try!  Would i come back? Yes...and often!  P.s. another great thig is that this place is Halal"}
{"text":"Not bad. I mean I'll have it again in the future, you know when you have something that is good but not OMG great but is satisfying? We its just that, the fries are good thin cuts and fresh , I just tried their Django sandwich it was nice, filled me nicely till likely dinner time. Only little con, it takes long for the fiod at least 15min, not good if you have a short lunch break."}
{"text":"Came here and got the Tony Montana. Essentially an elongated bun with 5 beef patties, two hashbrowns, some lettuce and a bunch of sauce. Very rich burger, but very delicious. Lots of flavor. For what it was, I'll give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a new halal restaurant in the Cote Vertu area. The sandwiches come in a soft and what seems like a freshly baked bread. The meat is freshly grilled and full of flavor with some veggie garnish thrown in the back. The meat is the central focus of the sandwiches. It's a nice place for a quick, cheap bite in the area"}
{"text":"Ironman. The sandwich that defines how good that place is. Good staff, which seems to always be the same. And when we went with my niece, I remember them changing the sports channel to a children's movie."}
{"text":"Vai Burger is one of my regular lunch spots.  Modeled real closely to Centrale Bergham, Vai Burger is a halal fast food joint that provides a variety of pita sandwiches and burgers. I've had 3 of their sandwiches (Tony Montana, Desperato & The Samurai) and they were..... all phenomenal!!!  My favorite was The Samurai.  You can upgrade to a combo option which consists of fries that are very similar to McDonald's which comes with a few sauces of your choice.  I'd rate this place 5 stars but will dock one as the drink in the combo is fountain based. Fountain based soda generally suck to me and theirs provides drinks that are somewhat watered down. Why not simply give us cans with these combos instead? It may cost a little more but they're vastly better than fountain syrups. This would seal the deal for me.   Also I'm not a fan of paying extra for decent soda in a combo option."}
{"text":"Huge portions but excellent food! A variety of options. Unlimited drink refills. The staff is friendly. Their poutine is one my fav menu options."}
{"text":"Love their Red Light sandwich. The tandoori chicken is really well seasoned, nicely grilled and with the right amount of heat. Their bread is very soft and warm, which goes well with the overall taste of the tandoori chicken. Definitely get it with their hot sauce!! Their sauces on the side that come with the fries are to die for. The people are really friendly and the place is always clean. However sometimes the waiting time can be inconsistent. Usually they're fast, but I've had times where the place was completely empty and it took 30+ minutes for them to make my sandwich (maybe the forgot my order). But otherwise I'd recommend this place, it's cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Came here on our first night in Montreal. Service was fast n friendly. Person taking our order helped us select from the menu and also cut the sandwich in half when asked. We got the vendetta, iron man, and red light.Portions are huge. The fries are also delicious. They realized we were visiting from out of town with all our questions and explained their menu to us. Gave us coupons to use next time. we came back again the next evening."}
{"text":"Vai burger is an other sandwich place just like montreal star or central bergham! Competition is strong in that type of sandwich, Vai has an amazing product and the sandwich tasty .. They need to work a little on the branding .. Wrapping burgers in paper that probably came from a fish & chips restauramt isnt very attractive, the tv was very loud and on top of that both tv were playing different shows, you can imagine the chaos... The choices of sauce is nothing compared to their competitor that is 2 streets away. The fries were tasty and a good replica to McDonalds, woudlve really enjoyed with more choices of sauce :(! Not living in the area i wouldnt drive for Vai burger but if im around i wouldnt mind grabbing a sandwich :)!   The staff was very nice and helpful in making the right choice"}
{"text":"The food is yummy .. I order the iron man and my hubby got desperado ( we thought it was best to get food that matched our personalities ) lol the food is great  not sure why a halal Place has bacon on their menu but the sandwich was filling .. at $23 ( I have given up caring about the exorbitant food and gas cost in Canada  ) I think the food was amazing !!! All the late night snackers this is a great place to go ( open till 12)."}
{"text":"Les frittes de la poutine manquaient clairement de cuisson. Autrement le sandwich \"le parisien\" était délicieux. Ça faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas mangé un sandwich aussi bon. Suivant un régime sans gluten, j'ai évité de manger le pain en picorant avec une fourchette le contenu.  On a été dérangé en plein repas par le bruit perçant, strident et grondant d'une perceuse qui drillait dans le carelage du sol juste derrière le comptoir ! Ça nous a bien bousillé les oreilles et ça m'a bien fusillé les nerfs. Toujours sympatique quand on veut juste profiter du dernier repas de sa journée tard le soir quand on est bien creuvé et qu'on souhaite juste savourer son repas et parler avec son amie tranquillement.  Ils auraient pu attendre la fermeture pour faire des travaux par simple respect pour leurs clients ou du moins prévenir les gens qui commandent qu'on va leur envoyer plus de 110 db pendant 20 minutes. J'ai trouvé ça totalement irresponsable de leur part, tant commercialement qu'au nivrau de la sécurité. Le niveau sonore avait de quoi laisser des séquelles.  Donc de la bonne bouffe mais un staff complètement inconscient."}
