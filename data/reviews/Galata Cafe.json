{"text":"Perhaps because I am from a small town in Northern Ontario with limited variety & selection but I must say I appreciated the wonderful flavorful food, warm hospitality of this quaint shop. I had a lunch combo which consisted of a Gozleme and a Mediterranean salad. The Gozleme is a crepe like soft triangle filled with cheese and spinach. Divine. I believe the owner teaches how to make the dough but being from away, I will need to rely on other means of instruction.     I will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing place to hang out if you live in the community. A nice morning breakfast. The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Previously, I'd never heard of the place, but I was taken there by a couple of friends of mine and really enjoyed my meal. Since then I've been in a number of times and look for excuses to head that way around lunch time.  The friendliest service ever. Each time I'm there I'm made to feel welcome.  Try them out. I'm sure you'll enjoy Galata Cafe."}
{"text":"I went here once accidentally while walking along Dundas St. I have no idea about Turkish cuisine, but the waitress helped and explained to me the different variety of food they serve. First, she made me try their garden salad with raspberry balsamic dressing. Then she served me with traditional Turkish tea, also called as Chai or black tea. It was very fancy. What I love the most was the Baklava dessert made by the owner herself. It was classic, not very sweet. All in all, the staff was very friendly. The owner asked me several times if I'm okay, she's very friendly. The place was very quiet, it is a good place to read a book while having breakfast or just drinking tea. I paid around $11."}
{"text":"There are not many places to try Turkish food in Etobicoke, so this little place is the best. I went in without knowing a lot about the cuisine, but wasn't disappointed! The Turkish breakfast omelet is delicious, and you can't beat the coffee and $1 mini-cookies!  Best bet for breakfast in the Islington village."}
{"text":"For those of you who saw the Istanbul episode of No Reservations and suddenly developed a deep craving for Turkish food you've never even had, I feel your pain. Then we randomly stumbled upon Anatolia, an unassuming little storefront along an almost derelict looking strip mall near Six Points. And the Turkish food craving was palliated. Today we tried a divine triumvirate of homemade mezes - hummus, walnut dip, and patlican ezme (glorious eggplant dip) - served with honestly the most addictive pide bread I have ever had. This alone was probably enough for 2 poeple, but not knowing the giant portions we ordered a g√∂zleme (spinach and cheese folded flatbread) which was great as well. Owner brought us complimentary strong Turkish coffee and delights to round out the meal. Amazing value for price point - we left a hefty tip, and we could not finish! Bright, cheery ambience with checkered tablecloths and fresh flowers. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my husband and we were not disappointed! Some of the best Turkish coffee I have had! And the owner was so friendly and even taught us how to make it.   We had their Turkish breakfast platter that comes with your choice of omelet. The bread is served warm and everything was fresh and delicious!  Will definitely be back to try their pastries!"}
{"text":"I'm having a difficult time trying to digest the other three reviews, especially about good value and portion size. My friend had warned me it was expensive but I didn't know what I was in for.  First of all, the menu items in the restaurant/store are actually more expensive than noted on the website. Also, there is no pricing on a lot of the items (i.e., hummus, bread, eggplant dip, etc.).  I wanted to order some hummus because I love what they serve at the restaurant a few doors down. The server confirmed it was the same product and she said she would give me 500g but didn't completely fill the container so it was more like 400g. I asked if I could get the same bread that they serve at the restaurant but she tried to push these Turkish bagels on me. She let me try a piece and it was alright but way too heavy to eat with hummus. The problem is that nothing is really on display so it's hard to get a visual of what to order. Anyway, I requested the bread again and she asked me how many I wanted. I had no idea because, again, it's not on display so I don't know the size. She told me the bread was $1 each. She brought it from the back and it was pretty small so I ordered three. She said she just baked them so she'll \"give\" me five pieces. By \"give\", I assumed the other two pieces were free. Then she started to try to sell me something with spinach but I told her next time.  When I cashed out I was literally stunned that the bill was almost $20! Really, $20 for a bit of hummus and some bread! I know, I should have asked ahead of time about the price but who charges that much hummus - it's chickpeas for God's sake and not cavier! I really thought it was going to be, at the most, about $10 (with pita and/or bread) like every other place in the city. In fact, at Kebob 49 and Tarboosh, for example, the bread is free. I didn't even get an itemized receipt so I don't know how much the hummus costs and if I was charged for the extra bread. Luckily I didn't agree to the bagels and the spinach thing or it might have been $40.  At that price, I was expecting the best hummus in the world but it was just average/kind of runny and definitely not what I've eaten the at restaurant and, unfortunately, the bread wasn't fresh as she indicated as the edges were hard.  I've written close to 250 reviews and I'm always honest. I understand that everyone needs to make a living but I felt like she was taking advantage of me. For that reason, I would not recommend it and I would not return."}
{"text":"Amazing food and really nice little cafe.. perfect for a weekend breakfast and sadly they removed the omelette option out from their full platter deal.. so now it's super expensive:("}
