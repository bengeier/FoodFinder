{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Thursday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were seated by the window with the fuzzy cushions, which appeared clean, although I am not entirely sure if it is hygienic to have communal plush items in a restaurant.   I ordered the Chirashi (assorted sashimi on rice) and my hubby ordered curry shrimp with coconut rice. We were a bit skeptical about the menu being Thai AND sushi (it's hard enough to excel in one type of cuisine--why would you choose to do two unless maybe you were mediocre at both rather than excellent at one?), but our doubts vanished when the dishes arrived. The sashimi in my bowl was generously cut (large slices) and fresh (minus the butterfish which might have been ever so slightly freezer-burned). There was a great variety also; I think we counted at least 9 different types of seafood. Hubby's dish had plenty of shrimp and the coconut rice was surprisingly flavorful. We had leftovers which tasted just as good the next day.   The only down-side is that this place isn't super cheap ($15-$25/main sans drinks, starters or dessert), but it isn't unreasonably expensive either. It's a nice place for a date or casual group celebration."}
{"text":"I live around this area but never have a chance to try this restaurant, but apparently my girlfriend decided to try thier food one day as she found online discount a Groupon. So she called for reservation as recommended in voucher, when we arrived their we got seat...perfect ! as we went their on Friday night quite busy and almost full. The servers were friendly and smile even they were so busy. The decor look like lounge and modern which good for dating night.....if I have one.  We order sushi and other Thai dishes, the food was nice and fresh as well as sushi too, we like decoration of the plate as we order something called \" Dragon\"...not sure what the name is which came out big and decorated like dragon wow.  Overall after use coupon we endup pay about 25 $ as we also other some drink too. We definately going back there"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was good.  It's a bit of an odd decor inside.  It's like it was a lounge in a past life and is now a sushi restaurant.  Our food was served on what I thought was really fancy plates for basic sushi.    Food was basic.  Nothing bad to say but nothing spectacular either.  If you're looking for a basic sushi place for lunch I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food flavors, small portion, and make sure you have time. We ordered avocado sushi rolls for the kids and we thought were overpriced: we typically pay less than $4/ea anywhere else. Here are over $7/ea."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. I recommend the coconut shrimp and the tempura. I did take a star off as they use packet sauces (plum etc) too much and I think making your own is much better. Delivery is super quick and generally this place is really good value for money and tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this is a good place for sushi, but it definitely is NOT good for Thai. Actually, this was the worst Thai I've ever had. The space is ok and so is the service, but not the food. We ordered Basil noodle with chicken and Beef with Cashew Nut Sauce. Both were a total miss! The only good thing was the beer..."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! The lunch specials are amazing, you get everything you want, entree - soup - spring roll. The spring rolls are really good so is the spicy salmon roll."}
{"text":"Sat down and ate at the restaurant for the first time, enjoyed the food, service was okay.  Decided to come back and bring friends over, again food was good, service was alright.    Then I decided to order out.  Arrive to pick up my order which was waiting for me in a booth seat, pay and was on my way.  Arrive home to find out we payed the say price for food but with half the portion they would give in house.  I then noticed my carrots were black and white.  I called they place and they said it may be the sauce causing this issue, which may be the case it must have sat in bag a long time for the food to change black and white...  After a bit of back and forth about the issue, the woman on the line tells me the next time I eat in, to let them know that I have a credit and it will be honoured simply by giving them my number.  I didn't feel like going back there so I agreed to her offer.    Five mines later she calls my phone to say she doesn't believe me, to send her a picture of these lovely carrots for proof.  I agree only to never hear from them again.  I was going to give them another chance, but after this terrible service, I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the location, good decor and ambiance. Food is always fresh and good quality- a bit pricey. Service is friendly & efficient. I usually get the spider roll- it's huge and they do a good job on the soft shell crab. I find the other Thai curry dishes a bit on the sweet side and not as spicy as I usually would  like. For Bloor West, one of the better Asian food options for sure."}
{"text":"I stop in for lunch or I place an order for pickup. The food is fresh and they have always accommodated my children by altering food items from the menu so that it's easier on their palate.  The service is okay, it could be better but I've had way worse.  The decor is decent and the staff is friendly.   The spicy salmon hand rolls and fresh rolls along with Tom Yum soup are favourite."}
{"text":"Their Crab Rangoons are AMAZING!  The Golden Curry is pretty delicious too.  Their sushi/maki/sashimi is fairly average and a bit overpriced.  Stick to the Thai side of the menu and you'll be a happy customer.  Note:  I always order delivery, so I've never been to the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service. Very good gluten free menu and selection. Gluten free items are indicated right on the menu. Went in about an hour and a half before closing, an felt like we were an inconvenience and rushed out by the serving staff."}
{"text":"I feel that the best way to rate this place is to think of results vs expectations. The moment you combine sushi and thai in one place, you know neither will be the best ever. The place is small and unassuming, rarely full (I was there on a Saturday night and barely half the place was full - and got even emptier around like 9PM) and does not try to over impress with anything. From my perspective, the place is nicely decorated, clean and has a nice vibe to it. Tables are pretty close together but the emptiness allows you a lot of privacy. Not a bad place for a date :) Service is a bit slower than expected as only one waitress works there. Not the best thing, but when the place is so empty you really don't need more. We got served and used the waiting time as a nice moment to chit chat with my girlfriend.  The sushi mix plate was quite nice - not mind blowing, but did the trick (I will admit I am not a sushi fan). I had the yellow thai curry and my gf had the vegetarian pad thai. Both really good (my yellow thai curry with the coconut rice was a great experience and enjoyed every bite of it). Did any of them beat the quality of a top sushi or thai restaurant? No... but then again, enjoyed fully in a nice clean place and the experience was really nice... just like the price. Very decent prices overall. Take the place for what it is and enjoy it... not a great place but you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here last week to pick up some pad thai on the way home and all I have to say is the place looks cool but the food is pretty bland.. As most have said, nothing special about this place.  Service was pretty good, I didn't wait that long for the food.  Not sure I'd recommend this one. Save your $$"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a gal pal and ordered from their lunch specials; ended up going with my fave Thai noodles, chicken pad thai. With your order they serve a complimentary wonton soup and one vegetable spring roll with a sweet and sour dip, which I really liked! The soup was bland.  I've honestly had better pad thai from other places worth the same price or even less. So nothing special about theirs but still pretty good.   I really liked the d√©cor of the restaurant and their bathroom stalls were clean! Service was good too.   It was my first time here but I wasn't blown away by the place and I maybe it's because I've had better selection of thai food from other places. I don't think I'll be coming back here, unless if my friend drags me back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I love the selection of sushi, especially if you are a vegetarian like me. My favorite is the mango avocado sushi. It tastes so good and very fresh too. I also love the yam rolls and their avocado salad. The service was great and very attentive. The decor lovely too. It maybe more pricey but it is worth it. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"According to a friend who works in the 'hood, Sushi & Thai has only been open for a couple weeks. Given their newness, I was especially impressed. They didn't have any of the normal kinks to work out. And the dish I ordered? Phenomenal.  The food here gets an \"A-\". Mine (Cashew Nut Tofu) deserves an A+ and since I'm the one writing this review, I ultimately determine the overall rating. Apparently the mango chicken was good but nothing to write home about. The other dishes were described as good and the presentation on all of them was quite nice! The dessert was good, to boot. The downside? We ordered coconut and mango ice cream and it came covered in chocolate and nuts. Given that it wasn't advertised as such, two of us were impressed with this addition and two of us were annoyed.  The owner came over to speak to us to see how we enjoyed our experience and we all had positive things to say (we hadn't yet received our dessert). The rest of the service was prompt, friendly and helpful.   The atmosphere was nice with dim lighting and lots of reds and blacks in the decor (may be a little loungey for some, but we liked it). The bathrooms were cleaner and more stylish than the average Toronto resto.   On top of all this, the prices seemed about average for Thai restaurants in Toronto but they seem to deliver a much nicer experience for your buck. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love  this place!  They are usually on deal sites so you do save a couple bucks.  We live in the neighborhood so please don't ever go away!  Service is friendly, sometimes could be a tad slow.  Never had an issue with food - everything is tasty and delicious so try it!  Our favorites are the Green Curry, Basil Chicken, Tom Yung Soup...etc (we prefer the Thai selections over the Japanese rolls).  D√©cor is wonderful and comfortable.  They also have a big party room in the back - maybe one day I will book it for a special occasion!  Ginger honey tea is delicious.  Love coming here with my husband."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend soon after the opening. Being a sushi lover I was interested in their interesting approach to the ingredients such as a strawberry and tuna combo! It was delish! I also had the curries which were tooooo diiieeee foorrr! Wonderful addition for sushi & Thai in the west."}
{"text":"Food is decent, not amazing. They serve a combo of Japanese and Thai food, although if you're looking for Thai - the Friendly Thai down the street might be a better bet.   The sushi here doesn't look super fresh.   The food was decent, but a bit over priced.   Servers were not Japanese, Chinese or Thai - make what you want from that."}
{"text":"PROS: -Ok food.   CONS: -Atrocious service. Crabby waitresses and food takes forever to come out. I asked for separate noodles for my Tom yum and it came out cold, sticky, undercooked, and when I was halfway through my soup.   -Empty water glasses. -_-'   -Really dirty washrooms with an unappetizing view of the dish room.   Overall, really unimpressed."}
{"text":"It's the one spot in my neighbourhood I hadn't been to - I'm glad I went. We had a Groupon so it was relatively reasonably priced. The lychee juice and calamari were great! The sushi wasn't bad. The service was good, considering how busy they were (lots of locals on a Thursday night). It was clean, bright (nice skylight). Pretty decent neighbourhood joint. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I ate there Friday night, yes ,I would also have to say the staff looked like they all wanted to be somewhere else , not a friendly place. The food way over priced, It would of been cheaper and a better dining experience to eat at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi for delivery. Wow....it was the worst sushi I ever had in my life. Stale rice and the rolls was essentially all avocado. I didn't pay 12 bucks for an avocado roll. Fish was also horrible. Did not try anything on the Thai menu and don't plan too."}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi place ever.. We ordered delivery and it was not only pricy but the quality was absolutely terrible. There was one spider roll and it was rotten the taste vile it made me want to puke. The other items were only decent quality like the ones you get in the grocery store that are left there for a while. Absolutely disgusting and horrid would not get anything from here again. You can order something even better with a lower price than what they charge.   I would avoid this place at all costs. Do not go here I would also question the way they handle food for it to be rotten. NEVER HAVE I EVER HAD ROTTEN FOOD IN A RESTAURANT BUT THIS ONE IS MY FIRST. Just talking about it reminds me of the nasty taste. Should be re-evaluated by health and safety. I also would not be surprised if they failed it more than once or got conditional passes."}
{"text":"Preface: Came here for lunch with Groupon voucher and the restaurant would NOT honor them because I ordered the lunch special, although no indication or warning was given beforehand.  My girlfriend lives somewhat close to Bloor West, so we decided to give this a try since there was a $25 for $12.50 deal. Came in for lunch on Civic Day and it was very empty (1 other table with customers). The waitress was curt and did not seem to care, but we decided that maybe she was just having a bad day. We ordered 2 lunch specials, the teriyaki salmon set and the 8pc sashimi set. They were both priced at $12 a set so not that cheap considering that this was on their \"lunch special\" menu.  Now the food. When you order an 8pc sashimi set, you'd expect EIGHT pieces of sashimi, right? Well, what my girlfriend got was 6 pieces of sashimi and 2 pieces of IMITATION CRAB MEAT. We both looked at each other a bit in disbelief but decided to just try the food since we were using a deal anyway... I guess more surprises awaited us. The 2 pieces of yellowtail was dry and stinky and we could not eat it. We decided to leave the sashimi set at that, and finished the teriyaki salmon set which wasn't too bad.   At the end of our meal, we let our waitress know that we wanted to pay with the Groupon but she adamantly refused to honor it, since we ordered off the lunch special menu. What?? There was no indication from her that we could not, so we were a bit peeved. We spoke with the manager regarding this and the unfresh fish, and not only did she not honor the Groupon, she also called us liars for telling her that the sashimi was unfresh. Ridiculous!! Only after we had her smell and taste the fish did she agree that it was unfresh, but still refused to give us anything to make up for the poor meal and service.   All in all, $28 for lunch that could be better spent anywhere else! Yes, even the Mickey D's down the road!"}
{"text":"Came here because it was a hot and rainy day on Bloor and this place was A/C or so I thought.  Wanted to go to \"The Works\" down the block but no one was in there, empty restaurants are never a good sign.  We were told to sit at the front of the restaurant by the window which was kind of uncomfortable, I don't like sitting with someone directly on my right side, sort of like sitting in a letter L  Anyways, I wanted to sit at a table but the seats either had crumbs or it was stained.  Not a good sign.  Ordered the Chicken Terriyaki lunch and spicy salmon roll.  The Chicken Terriyaki was just ok.  Salad dressing was too powerful.  The Spicy salmon roll was good but pricey at $10.95 for maybe eight pieces.  Service as just meh, not spectacular but just ok.  Would I come here again?  Not if I can help it"}
{"text":"Scores 4 for food, but 2 for decor/service.  The food was much better than expected, both on the sushi and the Thai side of the house.    Coconut soup was delicate and fresh, certainly recommended.  The mango salad was a variation of the standard green mango salad, with as one might guess, a riper version of the fruit.  This made for a sweeter experience enhanced with a thicker honey dressing.  Yummy.  Spring rolls were good, fresh rolls were less so.  Phad Thai was good too.  There is a contraption attached to the door, like an HVAC unit that comes on whenever some enters from outside.  Loud and annoying.  The red felt on the chairs was badly stained and desperately needed a reupholstering or deep cleaning.  The service was functional but not friendly.  This place will be a delivery/take-out only spot for us, as the food was very good."}
{"text":"The food quality is good; however, once you factor in price this place is not worth visiting. The Thai food has slightly better pricing than the Japanese options but a regular assortment of sushi is $26, deluxe assortment of sushi dinner is $40, standard rolls like spicy tuna, California, etc. are $11. Basically this place is 40-50% more expensive than any sushi place nearby. If you want sushi/Thai go to Spoon and Fork on the Qeensway - or if you're after standard sushi Momiji near Royal York is a fairly good option. Go here only if you like getting overcharged for typical sushi."}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon deal otherwise I wouldn't dine here, especially after this experience.   Service was terrible, they had three servers on but was very very slow. It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive and I was pretty irritated with their attitude. They did not seem to know the menu very well or much less care about the customers.   My friend and I ordered the Spicy Scallop rolls, Midnight rolls and Pad Kee Mao. The worse was the Pad Kee Mao, it was overcooked and was very unauthentic Thai food. The noodles were soggy and all I could taste was an overload of spices. For the price of the food I expected much more.   I was not impressed nor would I come back here again. Please don't venture here if you're hungry because you will leave here hungry."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the food at Sushi & Thai.  We ordered the crab rangoons on a whim and wow...  They were full of flavor, crispy and delicate.  The green curry is light and finishes with a hint of heat.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I bought a voucher for this restaurant and came here for an early dinner on a Saturday. It was not very busy at all, and the service was really good. I ordered the seaweed salad, mango roll, and apple ice cream for dessert.   The presentation is definitely part of what makes this place memorable. Everything came out looking like a work of art (seaweed salad was served in a martini glass) I tried to take pictures of a few things but I have a bad habit of eating before I remember to snap a photo.  My husband ordered a Thai stirfry and the rice arrived shaped in a perfect heart. The sauce on the stirfry was pretty sugary, so if I came back I'd stick with the sushi side of the menu. The ice cream/sorbet is really neat - it's served in a frozen fruit shell based on the flavor you order. Go for it!  Tables are very tiny so try to get a booth. Bathrooms are very clean."}
{"text":"I want to preface my review by saying that the service here was excellent.  Our waitress was very attentive and jovial - even with a full restaurant.  The decor is also very appealing and I enjoyed the ambiance.  There were, unfortunately, a few irksome elements to the dining experience.  I was in the mood for Thai, so I can't personally comment on the Japanese cuisine that they offer. I got the Panang Curry (peanut curry) and was shocked to find that the rice wasn't provided with the curry.  I would argue that the majority of people eat their curry with rice and it should therefore be included.  The rice is an additional $1.25 - it comes in a cute lil heart shape, which is all well and good, but I'd forgo that added pageantry not to pay extra.  The curry itself was also a little too sweet for my liking.  I was also disappointed that only their house red and white wine are offered by the glass. I think that they should offer a few more options (3 of each would be more appropriate).  Although, as I said, I didn't have the sushi myself, my dining companion did and she was less than impressed. She ordered the sweet potato maki and found that some of the pieces of sweet potato were still quite raw.  I feel that if they made a few changes this would actually be a fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"The server was friendly but it took half an hour just to get a salad even though it was empty!  Plus although the food was just okay it was way overpriced.  I doubt this place will last when there is so much selection in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad..decor needs some cleaning n sprucing up...food was out pretty quickly but price was a little high for what you got for sure.  Not a bad choice in a pinch"}
{"text":"Wholly Underwhelming.  We went in last night and had a less than stellar experience.   Basically, they were understaffed so much so that not only were we not acknowledged, but ended up seating ourselves and waiting the better part of 10 minutes before we got menus. They only had one server on the floor, and no busser or bartender, so she was very busy. It's not her fault, but still frustrating nonetheless.  We only ordered soups, a salad and a few handrolls, but it took almost 30 minutes just to get a seaweed salad. And let's be clear: this is a seaweed salad, which is 100% made offsite and already ready to go - all you do it plate it. Yes, presentation was nice, but it does not take 30 fricking minutes to slice 3 cherry tomatoes and add a slice of carrot.  The soups ended up coming out last (a miso and a seafood thai soup), and it had taken so long that we ended up having to get them packed up to go as we had tickets to the theatre and weren't missing Book of Mormon for this slop.   My miso ($3) was pretty expensive considering what you pay in most places; although it had more tofu and seaweed than other restos, it was still powdered miso. The real problem was the thai seafood soup - for $8, it was a horrible value. Frozen seafood, stinking broth and rubbery calamari. The only redeeming part of it was the large mussell. But the serving itself was less than 2 cups. For that price and size, I expect more than fake crab, a single shrimp and one ring of calamari.  For 2 soups, 1 seaweed salad and three handrolls - 40 DOLLARS. You've got to be kidding me. Absolutely terrible value!  Yes the room was pretty, but there's no point in having a nice looking resto if you have no idea how to run it.  We won't be back - ever."}
{"text":"Love it! I'll definitely be back :)  i went with a groupon, and ordered thai peanut curry which was scrumptioous. and also ordered a chicken teriyaki meal which was prob the best teriyaki i've had. the waiter was so very helpful, he helped me order food, and said not one word that i was eating all that food alone.. :)  yay, it'll be my new go-to restaurant in Toronto when friends come visiting, because even the atmosphere and seating is  comfortable and lil trendy."}
