{"text":"As English speakers in a predominantly French area, some restaurants prove to be a little difficult. However, this place was not one of them. The women who was working (who I also assume is the head baker because of her knowledge of the product) explained her specialities and helped us through what to order. I ordered an egg sandwich which was AMAZING. Fresh homemade English muffin, egg, ham, cheese, and sprouts. I also ordered a latte which was as beautiful as it was tasty. It was very smooth and creamy. This is a very good coffee shop and breakfast spot. All the pastries looked delicious. My mother had tried  a pastry that looked like a bun, with a croissant texture and as the women explained it was a mix of brioche and croissant infused with citrus. It was delectable! We will be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Mignon et bon!
L'endroit est magnifique et les biscuits sont bons! il faudra revenir pour le reste. Take away possible. Wifi réduit."}
{"text":"Wow ... it was a very hot day, so I tried the soup of the day, a cold spinach/coconut milk and it was amazing ... also the Cappucino and baked goods were wonderful.   Great cozy spot, well worth a visit !!"}
{"text":"Though I have only visited this cafe once briefly for a business meeting, even that quick coffee was a memorable experience. While munching on a piece of delicious passionfruit cake, all I could do was marvel at the beautiful woodwork detailing the restaurant. Handcrafted tables, sleek but warm design, and a state-of-the-art glass-encased kitchen to keep the cooking staff cool in the heat. Amazing! Friendly service packed full of charm."}
{"text":"such a charming cafe. delicious sweet treats and yummy coffee. I love the decor and the little details - initials carved into the tables, crown moldings , beautiful pastries on display. it was so quiet in there you can sit in peace and quiet. neighborhood gem in the village"}
{"text":"Quite a big café, grabbed a cheesecake, quite good, didn't like the base though, not moist enough"}
{"text":"Bonne pâtisserie et repas du dîner intéressant. Un peu dispendieux mais ingrédients de qualité et bio."}
{"text":"Excellent pastries and paninis. They serve a daily soup indicated on the menu board posted on the wall."}
{"text":"Nouvelle découverte pour moi dans ce quartier du centre-ville. L'endroit est assez jolie, avec un look quasi baroque romantique et tellement moderne à la fois. Mon choix s'est arrêté au grilled-cheese aux pommes, dis comme ça cela ne paye pas de mine mais en fait, c'était extrêmement bon, avec un bon fromage vieilli, c'était coulant fondant, un vrai délice pour les papilles. Je ne peux pas donner la cinquième étoile à cause du prix, je dois admettre que c'était fameux et délicieux mais assez cher. Je reviendrai avec plaisir."}
{"text":"Lovely, bright café with a relaxed and friendly vibe. I stopped in for lunch and had an amazing sprouts salad, which was served with two slices of toasted homemade bread. I thought it tasted amazing, and 3/4 of the way through I saw the dressing hidden behind the bowl, added it, and the salad was even more amazing with the dressing. 

I branched out a bit and tried the lavender latté ... ce n'était pas à mon goût. Next time I'll stick with the standard kind. I was intrigued by the chocolate chai latté but it wasn't available dairy-free, so please try it for me and let me know how it is.

Their baked goods looked delish but I had used up my budget on lunch & coffee. Another time."}
{"text":"Cozy and adorable little spot on Amherst serving pastries, sandwiches and salads. The coffee is not great (the cappuccino in a mug is HUGE, equivalent to a latte in general coffee standards) but the sandwiches and salads are unique and tasty. Loved the pan fried pork panini!

Great little spot to sit and enjoy a book on a sunny winter day :)"}
{"text":"Super cute café located in the village. Lots of Pinterest-like details in their charming decor. 

Not a lot of space so it gets filled here quickly, esp on weekends. 

I opted for the cappuccino bowl and it was HUGE. It was good but I couldn't finish it. Their egg sandwiches are wonderfully constructed. 

****Free WiFi!"}
{"text":"Toute de blanc et bois, cette place est décorée avec gout ! C'est calme et cosy, les vitrines sont magnifiques et les sandwich sont originaux."}
{"text":"Looking for a relatively quick espresso and amazing croissant and I got both! In fact, I felt like I could have chosen any of the pasties and it would have been a great choice. The main thing I'm sad about is that we didn't have time to hang out longer because I really loved the atmosphere here. It was really conducive to hanging out and kicking back."}
{"text":"I visited this cafe because it was walking distance from where I stayed, but it left me pleasantly surprised!
I ordered a breakfast wrap that tasted more among the lines of a breakfast burrito, and my friend ordered a breakfast bowl with melted chocolate, nuts, and fresh fruit.

I would give 3 stars for my order (nothing special) and 5 stars for my friend's order. It tasted divine! The gooey chocolate with berries, passionfruit, peaches combined with the almond slivers somehow had complex flavours that left me wanting more. I still remember the taste so clearly, and I hope they keep this gem on the menu!"}
{"text":"Un joli petit pas si petit café sur Amherst, ouvert depuis quelques années déjà. Ils ne servent plus juste de la pâtisserie, bien que toujours aussi délicieuse. Des sandwiches déjeuner ainsi que des salades-repas font aussi partie du menu. Pour ma part j'ai adoré mon latte lavande, un goût subtil, inusité et très agréable en bouche. Accompagné d'un très bon & généreux sandwich aux oeufs. Une expérience agréable. 11$. Du WiFi via Île-sans-fil est disponible et les étudiants/travailleurs autonomes y sont les bienvenus. À y retourner."}
{"text":"Très sympa et très cozy, mais un peu cher j'ai trouvé 
Pas assez de choix de menus pour le brunch, dommage!
Cependant, à tester car original, pour le café du matin ou le thé de l'après-midi!"}
{"text":"Très déçu de cet endroit qui existe depuis des années. Des prix réellement excessifs pour des portions vraiment moyennes - mention spéciale aux tartes aux fruits de 3 cm de large pour 5$. 
L'accueil de la serveuse et de ce qui semblait être la maîtresse de maison était relativement froid, et donc forcément décevant. 
La décoration elle, est charmante. 
Je ne reviendrais pas dans cet endroit."}
{"text":"Cute place. Fantastic bakery items. Very accommodating with English speaking customers. Highly recommend the brioche cinnamon rolls. They were amazing! We even got more to go for the next morning."}
{"text":"Very cute coffee shop. I had the Lox and bagel and my boyfriend has breakfast sandwich. I am pretty jealous of the breakfast sandwich on English muffin. It was warm, crispy, and cheese melted perfectly. If I could go back, I would definitely have gotten that. Lox and bagel was good, but not the best I have ever had. Atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place. I went therr with a bunch of friends for brunch. The food is really good, in a decent portion. It happened that I wasn't that hungry that day so I took the second part of my panini home. 

The staff is friendly. Service is good too. I guess nothing that \"Wow'ed\" me but I believe it's still worth 5-stars :)"}
{"text":"Charmant, réconfortant, invitant. Ce café vaut le 8 minutes de marche à partir de Berri UQAM, pour ceux qui hésitaient encore à faire le détour. 

On rentre avec l'envie de prendre un café et un repas léger, on finit par s'assoir à l'une de leur mignonne chaise avec une pâtisserie ou une viennoiserie maison, un latte à la lavande et un pain de la boulangerie Le Pain Dans Les Voiles sous le bras, pour déguster plus tard avec notre souper. Ils offrent également de savoureuses salades, soupes, paninis et autres plats réconfortants qui vous feront revenir encore et encore. Bob Dylan nous berce pendant qu'on tappote sur notre laptop dans l'espace réservé aux tablettes et ordinateurs, tabourets et grande banquette vintage pour notre confort, afin de laisser la place aux gens qui veulent discuter bien au soleil sur les petites tables à l'avant proche des fenêtres. Le staff est discret et souriant, le café bien exécuté; on vend même de ravissants gâteaux qui se mangent avec les yeux avant d'en savourer les arômes, une menue bouchée à la fois. Vous n'êtes toujours pas convaincus? Ils ont aussi de la bière de microbrasseries pour ceux qui aiment de gâter à toutes heures de la journée. BAM, vendus."}
{"text":"Toujours un plaisir de venir prendre un sandwich déjeune avec un café. Depuis plus de 4 ans pour moi c'est un passage obligatoire à farine et eau fraîche chaque mois. Beau décor belle ambiance super Marie-Lou ( la propriétaire et chef de l'établissement) et c'est avec triste que aujourd'hui j'ai pris mon dernier petit déjeuner montréalais avant de prendre mon avion direction Vancouver ! Avec plaisir et gourmandise à bientôt lors d'un passage à Montréal. Sacha un client satisfait :)"}
{"text":"Super endroit! Très beau, très bon et original. Pour les moins, j'irais chaque semaine si c'était un peu moins cher. Je commande habituellement le bagel au saumon fumé qui vient avec un mini yogourt et un café, ça me reviens à 22$ avec pourboire. Ce n'est donc pas à tout les matins! Aussi, je comprend la restriction sur les ordinateurs portable, mais me faire déplacer au comptoir avec mon bagel a 22$ alors que le restaurant est vide j'ai trouvé ça ordinaire. Surtout de me le faire dire après la commande."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!
The whole front is opened up (in the summer of course) making the atmosphere that much more amazing. White and simple interior that is stunning!
Coffee and food are great. Nothing too mind blowing. Cute pastries and delicious sandwiches. My favourite and go-to is the TONKATSU. It's pork that is pan fried and the combo of ingredients is so yummy!! There are some laptop restrictions but this is a great place to go and catch up with a friend or read a book.

{"text":"Went in near closing time to shield ourselves from the evening chill.

There's tea and coffee and a wide array of baked goods. The tea selection is not vast: classic blacks and rooibos, greens and whites; which is a plus if you subscribe to the paradox of choice. My friend and I both enjoyed a white tea, each came in a fancy teacup and small teapot. 

Service is quick and friendly. Crowd is young: some students on their laptops, a couple speaking in hushed tones in the back, and others reading in their favourite spot.

Wooden tables and soft lighting lend this shop an intimate feel. Ideal date spot."}
{"text":"Had the English muffin w bacon and the salmon crepe. Was sooooo good! Great service! Enjoyed my coffee by the bowl."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little bakery and teahouse. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was charming (light jazz). My wife enjoyed her chai chocolate and I had an Assam tea (kind of like English breakfast). Be careful of the milk dispensers.

Overall, I would rate it as a quite nice place to relax for a short time."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best croissants I've ever had. The plain was fantastic and the almond was simply perfection. I also had a little cookie decorated like a pair of lips, which was cuter than it tasted, but worth it for the Instagram. :D"}
{"text":"There are only a couple of decent joints near the CBC building on Rene-Levesque that I could recommend for a small bite in a pleasurable atmosphere. Thank goodness De Farine has arrived on the scene! The owner and chef has done a great job on maintaining a balance between friendly and efficient. Her innovative pastries are incredible: try the bacon and cheddar croissant, corn muffin, or matcha biscotti-like treat. Her sous-pastry chef puts love into every goodie she bakes. The smoothies are cray-cray (they accommodate for non-dairy too). 

The interior is visually unique to the Village too: minimal-baroque mixed with rustic, exposed wood. De Farine in a word? Charming!"}
{"text":"Nice spacious café in the gay village, with the best coffee in Montreal, yummy pastries and décor with good taste. The atmosphere is relaxing and chill, music not too loud, and not as packed as many other popular cafés  in Montreal, perfect for those who would like to take an afternoon coffee break with a nice book and cake. Try the allongé if you are into strong coffee."}
{"text":"I didn't get to stay but I did pick up a cake on the fly for a good friend of mine's birthday.  She's not much of a dessert person, but I do know that she enjoys a not-too-sweet slice once in a while. 

The service was great, I got some help picking out  a Coconut-Lemon Olive Oil Cake and found a cat cookie to place on top! (She's one of those cat people) I did notice how busy the cafe was, and wished to stay for a cup. They had these cute little cakes inside variety of cake stands.

Side Note: I kinda love the business card, it's simple, and to the point, and not of typical size.

Taste verdict: 8 of us enjoyed the cake a lot, and she shared the cat cookie with us, that for some reason tasted like berries to us! The cake was moist, not overpoweringly lemony, and most important not uber sweet! I can't wait to try the other products here."}
{"text":"Le meilleur sandwich au Saumon bio en ville!"}
{"text":"The decor of this little coffee place is what really makes it unique and so charming. Looking at their pastry selection, you absolutely want to try everything. Plus, there is free wifi and a space for people with computers if you are looking to get some work done in a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Friendly, fresh and nice atmosphere. The food is clearly made with care."}

Very small, quaint, cute shop
Egg salad sandwich with bacon on pumpernickel was good without being too eggy
Wife enjoyed egg on English muffin
That cappuccino bowl was F'ing HUGE. Its like 6 American cappuccinos, probably more. But, it's not as strong as American cappuccino.

Good coffee
Although we didn't order he price fixe brunche, it looked scrumptious, however it looked like A LOT of food...order only if your hungry
Donut was good

For some reason, I expected more out of the orange juice"}
{"text":"This place reminds me in Paris and France...
Lovely cosy place to Brunch...
The food is tasty and delicious, but the coffee and the Café au lait is amazing and mind blowing !!! I will definitely miss that taste when I'm back to Boston.
I'll visit this place again on my next trip to Montreal !
C'est super!!"}
{"text":"Very  trendy and cozy.  enjoyed  my Espresso in a very  relaxed way! Probably  not the ideal snack  place,  but if you are up for  a hot cup of coffee while watching the winter  outside,  the place is an ideal location."}
{"text":"A chic bakery serving delicious pastries, coffee and small dessert items.  The breakfast pastries were light , fluffy, and full of flavors.  It has a lovey interior.  It's great for a leisure stop to enjoy the beautiful interior decor or grab and go."}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up a few treats and stayed for a cappuccino and a brioche. The coffee was delicious, and the brioche (topped with icing and filled with raisins) was one of the best I have had. Though at first I was disappointed that it was a bit small, the taste was incredible. The ratios of bread to icing to raisins was perfect and I think the size was perfect, actually. The donuts looked delicious also, and next time I want to try one. Another patron was eating a salad which looked very good.

I took home a small box of cookies to have with my afternoon tea, and they were all great. The earl grey cookies could have been a bit more flavorful. However, the taste of earl grey, or similar flavor profiles like lavender or rose, is also easy to overdue, and I would rather have too little flavor than too much. The other cookies I got were playfully decorated. I especially loved the chocolate 'bisous' cookies.

I will definitely come back for a coffee and a snack. DFEF has a wonderful atmosphere - nicely decorated, clean, and quiet - and is great for getting some work done. 

I would consider purchasing one of their exquisite looking cakes, but perhaps only for a special occasion since they are a bit pricey. Still, you get what you pay for, and here you are definitely paying for high-quality foods that are expertly prepared."}
{"text":"I always stop by DFEF for my morning fix every time I'm visiting Montreal. Their pastries look and taste amazing. I found my favorite latte here which was Lavender Latte. The falafel salad is also good!

You must try a bowl of Assiette de pommes de terre croustillantes & crème sûre à l'oignon vert for $5!"}

{"text":"Let's start with the pros: 
1. What a lovely place! I really didn't expect it, specially in this area! The interior design is really great.
2. The food looks awesome! It's a decoration by itself. 

Now the cons: 
1. Unfortunately, the food is not as tasty as it looks (greasy or too sweet), which is even more disappointing considering the average price.
2. Laptop owners be aware that during lunch break (starting at 11.30 am) you won't be allowed to stay in the common area, you'll have to seat at the counter, the very smelly one (right in front of the kitchen), even if the place is totally empty. 
3. It is veryyyy quiet. Don't expect to meet or talk to anyone here, as it is clearly not the purpose. Basically it's the kinda place where you feel lonely, but if it's what you aim for, go for it! Bring a book, and it would be your best friend!"}
{"text":"Magnifique petit café avec souci du détail, bien décoré & bien meublé. Mon expresso était bon. J'y retournerai probablement pour goûter leurs sandwichs & desserts, si je passe par là."}
{"text":"Quel magnifique endroit ! Vintage et coquet, il y a de grandes tables où l'on peut travailler en paix (WiFi gratuit via l'Île Sans Fil). J'y allais simplement pour étudier en sirotant un café, mais impossible de résister à leur étalage de pâtisseries maison : cake au thé à la rose, sablés au chocolat à la fleur de sel, pots de crème caramel... Vraiment alléchant ! Le latte à la lavande était tout à fait original, l'arôme de lavande était bien dosé, ni trop présent ni trop subtil.  Le service était irréprochable. La musique était agréable et pas trop forte. J'ai adoré ma première visite et j'y retournerai sans faute."}
