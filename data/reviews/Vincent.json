{"text":"I ordered a large lasagna with more sauce for delivery. It was delivered 1.5 hours later (there was however a snow storm), but the lasagna was very dry, with only about 1/2 cup of sauce! Good thing i asked for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"The lady whom I spoke to on the phone was very illeterate and was yelling more than actually speaking. Although I usually love their take out service for pizza, I would not recommend it for anything else! I found bones in my chicken cream and my chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and calamari were fried to the point that they were burnt! Extremely disappointed about my service tonight."}
