{"text":"The guy that works there and who drives the green Volvo with California plates and has greasy Jerry Curl Mullet hair style needs to learn how to drive in a parking lot. He almost T-Boned us in the parking lot while we were truning into a parking spot. He was in a hurry to put their sign up. Confronted him and we exchanged words he told me he did nothing wrong and shut my mouth. Nice customer service you Jerry Curled bitch. Your actions and attitude towards me is what made me not come into your establishment and is going to keep me from coming into your establishment . You definitely ain't from the south. More like a Gay New Yorker. SLOW DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"I am an avid supporter of small business, and also as a chef I am always anxious to try new restaurants. Heard about Bebe's on the radio and though to give it a try. So my wife and I made the trek from Maricopa to the west side of Phoenix. I was utterly disappointed, not just as a customer, but also as a Chef. They were out of Chicken breast, Macaroni & cheese, and collard greens. So we settled on a chicken sandwich. The chicken was hard, the bread was hard, rather than leaf lettuce, or even a leaf of iceberg lettuce it was salad size chopped lettuce and super soft tomatoes. My wife's meal was just as bad. Rather than make a scene, we just left and went to our regular favorite soul food spot. Ezekiel's on Warner in Ahwautukee! Now that's good food."}
{"text":"Been wanting to stop by and try this place for a couple months now. Had the day off so today was the day...  Ordered the BBQ Chicken Dinner (comes with 3 sides) with Collard Greens,  Red Beans and Rice, and Mac and Cheese...  While waiting for the food the staff was very friendly and engaging...  Felt very welcomed... Got home and the food was great... I will definitely be back to try more of the menu...."}
{"text":"Eating soul food in so many states as I was a major traveler.... We ordered to go the wait was at least 25 mins so we were expecting the food to be great. I looked up reviews on here so I took a risk and major disappointment.... 1 large catfish (which was 3 very small pieces) 1 small fried chicken and peach cobbler for $36
That's way too expensive.... We didn't even eat the food the coleslaw was brown and smelt bad the chicken was just ok
What a waste of money 
Never going there again
I wouldn't go there .... Not worth the money"}
{"text":"When I saw this place I was so excited to have some Soul food near by. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I order the fried catfish and was disappointed. It was just okay. My hopes may have been to high as I am use to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and Miss White's. Now that is some delicious Soul food!!!"}
{"text":"That was the most nasty food we've ever tasted! Canned collard greens tasted cheap! The potato salad tasted so nasty! The Mac and cheese had some nasty black stuff inside! The fish was so tiny and tasted slimmy, old, and nasty. The cornbread tasted old dry, as if they added water only! This was the worst Soul Food restaurant we've ever ate at! That nasty food will have you sick to your stomach! The restaurant is hidden in a ghetto area, was one red flag right there!  When we arrived,  there was not one Customer sitting inside the restaurant, and we should have followed our first minds not to eat there, but we gave it a try. There was only one old black man doing the cooking, being the freaking waiter, and cashier too! Folks too stingy to hire workers! Seriously, those people needs to close their doors!"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order on Uber Eats and just received my order. I ordered the fried chicken and always check my chicken from anywhere before eating. I am so glad I did my chicken was undercooked as in still bleeding!!! If you order from here make sure to check your chicken before eating. I also ordered baked beans but they gave me red beans and rice instead. After seeing the undercooked chicken i didn't even eat the sides so can't review them."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Decent portions, very flavorful, Authentic, And a large selection of sides. We had cornbread muffins, candied yams, mac n cheese, red beans n rice, fried okra, bbq chicken, n ribs. The cornbread was okay, everything else was amazing. My boyfriend had a nice glass of kool aid, which tied up the meal. My ONLY complaint....it was very hot inside,  a/c could have turned down a little more (must have been 85-90 degrees in there), but I just pretended that I was back in Georgia, where that is a common thing in restaurants etc. Give it a try! Finger licking good"}
{"text":"I ate here once. The ribs are very good. However, the greens were extremely salty and because I look forward to eating the greens I was disappointed so I haven't been back."}
{"text":"This place is utter bullshit. First off the service is horrible. Whoever the lady who doesn't greet you is horrible. She didn't acknowledge us until we said excuse me can we order, after being there about 10 minutes just standing at the counter. Then the food is way overpriced and you get very little portions and to top it all off, it's flavorless. I'll stick to KFC and Church's, heck even Fry's has better food. Stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm 7 months pregnant and I've been craving some really good fried fish. I was blessed to find BeBe's online. I've been really particular in my food selection; especially now that my taste buds are in enhanced. BeBes exceeded my expectations. I had the fried fish, mac  and cheese, mashed potatoes  and corn. l loved it. I have a hearty appetite and the portions were more than enough. My husband had the bbq chicken and ribs. He let me try some of his and It was AMAZING. This will be my new spot to get really good home cooked food. Especially for those days I don't feel like cooking. They had a pretty good drink selection the kool aid and sweet tea was really delightful. The thing I liked the most about the drinks were that they weren't too sweet."}
{"text":"All the food was cheaply made and the service is very poor and rude to any customers that are not of afican American orgins after i called in my order the total was $46 when i came in to pick it up it got knocked up to $75 just for adding a couple $3 sides the man that worked the register had a very ugly attitude because i added to my order i felt unwelcomed and i had to wait at the register to pay for at least 20 mins while he served the pepole at the tables even though my food was already on on the counter waiting for me who knows how long so by the time i paid the overly expensive meal and left to my disappointment the entire order was cold not to mention they didnt give me any condiments for the fish dinner. the mashed potatoes were flavorless and the mac n cheese as well also the warm extremely  sweet potatoe salad was watery this is not by far soul food.. so much for a mother's day dinner"}
{"text":"I placed an order through GrubHub. The food arrived timely and was good. I would have liked my fish cooked just a little longer, I was skeptical
of the mac and cheese b/c it didn't look baked, but I was wrong, prepared very well. I will be visiting or ordering from Bebe's again."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I drove from Surprise to taste this food. The side was smaller than the sides from kfc or churches chicken. I could not believe this. You will only get maybe 3 spoonfulls out of the sides. Very disappointed. Then the cornbread was smaller than a silver dollar. I order fried chicken. It was nasty as hell. No seasoning at all. I am pissed that i spent 15.00 for unseason chicken and 3 teaspoons off greens, yams and dry mac and cheese. I will never and i mean NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. I PREFER TO DRIVE TO LOLO's....

The owner then sent me a nasty message saying I was lying so now I have enclosed pictures to prove my point. To prove her sides are not the size she is claiming. Lier. And I am going to make sure people read what you sent me. 


Hi T, Fairillia T. sent you a message on Yelp:

Subject: Your Review\"TG, hi, I am sorry that you feel that you had to write just a nasty and low review. I talked to the manager and cook that were there when you came in yesterday, they both said that you came in complaining even before you received your food, talking about bad reviews. we served the same size as all other restaurants. we eat out a lot and this is what size everyone else uses for their sides. We really take pride in our cooking and customer service. The manager said that she went out of her way to please you, she went over and beyond, but you came in complaining. You really need to ask yourself a question, are you being fair to us writing such a nasty review for everyone to see when you know that she tried hard to please you, if your mind was made up, there was nothing that she could do to satisfy you no matter how hard she tried. We served good food and it was seasoned, please be fair to us and do not write reviews like this when you know that we bent over backward to please you, It is not right."}
{"text":"Purchased a deal from groupon a while back and since we were in the area, decided to stop and use the discount.  

First I would to point out that the strip-center this restaurant is located in is not very appealing or safe looking.  We sat by the window and watched our car the entire time!

The food wasn't bad.  We had the ribs. It appeared that they were grilled in front of the restaurant on a home griller earlier in the day -- maybe this is one reason the owner likes this location, a more upscale strip-center would not allow a griller to take-up a parking space in the lot.  Anyway, the cornbread and veggies that came with our meals were very tasty -- especially the okra.  

The service was good.  Waitresses were both extremely friendly and helpful.  The restroom was not as clean as I'd like for it to have been, nor were the floors in the entire place.  There was really no décor to speak of.  

They had a number of customers come in that I'd say were \"regulars\" as they all seem to know each other.  So they seem to do a decent business.  

I'm afraid that we won't be returning. The safety issues were too troubling.  If they moved to a different location, we would, however, give them another try."}
{"text":"Not sure how long this has been around.  Wife wanted to eat lunch here.  The food was bland/tasteless felt very cheap quality way overpriced.
We will never go back here.  We would not recommend to any of our friends."}
{"text":"im torn, server  couldn't have possibly been nicer , service was top notch. had fried chicken and 3 sides, while food tasted fine, thought it was a bit pricy for what I got chicken pieces weren't very large for the price .  I left still a little hungry  considering the meal was 13.99 . im going to give it another try and try the barbeque.  im willing to chalk it up to a bad day"}
{"text":"The food was still good however the seasoning on most of the food was under used. Besides that, everything was great. Love the kool aid as well."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night.  I had a groupon and took my family out for my mother's birthday.  Let's start out with the positive - our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  We were the only ones in so we received all of her attention.  The cook in the back was also friendly.  Now for the bad - the food was beyond terrible.  We started off ordering 2 orka's.  They were very small amounts when the came out and not the portion size of other restaurants (I saw a similar review saying the same thing before - I agree).  When we talked about ordering the 2-meat combo, the cook said there were two ribs per meat (so we would get 4 ribs total).  Food came out with only two ribs and the waitress apologized that it was a misunderstanding and only 1 ribs per \"meat\" (again with the small size of the food).  I ordered the 3-meat combo (BBQ chicken, rib, and fried chicken).  I received one rib, a chicken leg, and a very small fried breast (that looked more like chicken fingers).  Now the really bad part, the rib was cold!! Not a little cold but right out of the refrigerator cold.  I tried the mashed potatoes and they were the same - frig cold!!  My son ordered wings and they were also cold.  We sent it back and I could hear the microwave ding when my food was heated up.  WOW!!!  The waitress (and cook later) apologies for serving cold food.  He was in a hurry to get all of our food out so he missed a couple plates.  Again - WOW!!  If I wanted leftover food that had been cooked hours (maybe previous day?) before and reheated in a microwave,  I could have bought a frozen sandwich at the 7-11 on corner and used their microwave.  This was the worst meal my family and I have had that we could all remember.  Just terrible is all I can really come up with as a thought.  The bill was $60 for two 3-meat dinners, 2 okra, wings, and 5 drinks.  Way over priced even if the food was good - which is was not.  Let me end on a positive note about the server - she was apologizing throughout the meal and did give all of us free deserts to go.  She invited us back to try it again.  I will have to pass and would recommend that you pass on this restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats. It was not very good. The ribs were dried out and tough. The rice and gravy were very bland and almost mushy. The corn muffin hadn't risen so the center was only 1\2 inch thick. If I had made it at home, I would have thrown it out, let alone serve to a customer. The only thing half way edible was the macaroni and cheese. The clobber had very little topping and was more like peach soup. Thought giving an independent restaurant was worth the chance, but in this case, their food showed little attention to detail or care."}
{"text":"The smothered pork chops were great along with the sweet potato pie. I mean I could take a bath in the gravy! The staff is friendly and fast. Our family ordered smotherd pork chops, greens, mac and cheese, black eyed peas, fried chicken, okra, sweet potato pie and German chocolate cake, it was done and ready for pick up 20 minutes later, NICE!"}
{"text":"Went in when we first moved to the area (about a month ago) hoping to find something close to a once local favorite restaurant back in California... the waitress was very friendly, absolutely no complaints about the service, but the food was severely lacking and overpriced for the quality. Had the food been as good as we were hoping, and the portions a tad bigger, we would gladly pay the price and return, but as it stands we won't be."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon and was looking forward to trying Bebe's. I took my son in for dinner last night and  the waitress noticed that I had my Groupon in hand. She said that the owner decided to no longer honor Groupon? She explained that some people would  only spend  $22 and instructed me to call Groupon for a refund. I can not review the food because i will never eat there, They have been on there for many months and just now decide not to honor their word? No wonder the place was completely empty at 6:30pm!"}
{"text":"Tried waking in here tonight at 6:30 pm and was stopped at the door and told they were closed. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food. I showed up right as they were closing down, and the guy that took my order was kind, and made my food from scratch. The food was so fresh and tasted just like i was in the south. I will certainly be coming back today. The only downfall and i mean only downfall is I wanted smothered pork chops and he didn't have any. Instead i had smothered chicken and it was worth the switch. Not to mention the red velvet cake was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for soul food... This is a great west side stop. We had the catfish and the BBQ ribs, both were full of flavor and tender & juicy. The sides were good too, especially the collard greens - yum! We tried the fried okra, red beans and rice and black eyed peas. All hit the spot and we were crazy full. The rice in the rice and gravy side was over cooked, but overall we were really happy with the food and the service. If you're looking for some fancy ambiance, this isn't it. If you're looking for some good ol' southern cooking in a mom and pop shop- I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Some black people have a lot to learn about business and everything involved with running a successful one. I can say this because one my family ran  a business for 35 years for which I was a willing participant and two I am as black as the ace of spades. So yes your correct im pulling the dreaded race card. Be Be's restaurant , I don't mince words sucked the big weenie. I'll tell you why, portions are small, prices are high, the employees/owner argue freely in front of customers like they was down on Grape st. in Compton. Allow me to make one thing absolutely clear. I dine out strictly for pleasure, I like to cook and I'm a good one. If I wanted to hear black folks fussing talking smack and bickering with one another whilst burning up food I could have just stayed at home. Perhaps the biggest reason that I didn't enjoy my dining experience was that the owner or proprietor had a self-serve standup beverage case that housed his  beer. The case was rather close to where patrons sit adjacent to a long counter top. With a five dollar bill with my left hand up and right in front of him with my right hand I got a beer from the self serve case. \" I cant have you getting beer out of my case\", Nigga please I thought to myself, a self serve case is what it is. Besides that I got more beer at home then he kept in his stingy little box. Anyway I spent 80 bucks in that greasy spoon and I'll tell you what there went his tip. On top of that I was one dinner short when I got home. I called and by the way the person on the other end doubted the validity of my claim I thought they were gonna request Deoxyribonucleic Acid to see if I had really been there. The owner for sure needed to hone his cust relations skills he treated me like I was the enemy. Hummmm....maybe I am."}
{"text":"No longer accepts groupons. Food is too salty. Only one staff member provided good customer service."}
{"text":"Thanks guys for the reviews....I frequent the strip mall and wanted to grab some from...went inside of BSC and notice two older women waiting to be served..RED FLAG#1(Only 2 customers in a busy strip mall).  RED FLAG#2 Prices are extremely high and this establishment only received 2 1/2 stars.  I have never had any issues w/my safety or my car and frequent the strip mall often.  I followed my first mind and grabbed a soda to go the older gentleman was very nice.  RED FLAG#3 I noticed two older women in the back cooking the food w/no hair net.  I have drove several miles and over 45mins for some great soul food(PAPA JOES) 2019 W Bethany Home Rd Phoenix, AZ 85015 
Phone number  (602) 973-7003 its also in a strip mall and not a great neighbor hood,but the food is great and reasonable and worth the drive and my gas, yes its a \"hold in the wall\" but the food is \"BOMB\"  No disrespect \"LOWER\" your prices and I'm sure your will get better reviews and take down that tacky\"ass\"sign on a white sheet of copy paper and menu written with a red marker."}
{"text":"Food was very good guy came to my house to drop it off the only thing is they forgot my cornbread but other than that everything was very delicious."}
{"text":"The food here was awful!  Price's were crazy, average meal per person 25.00. The sides including collard greens were either from cans or badly prepared from instant packaging. The meat....I won't go there! Do yourself a favor and stick to tried and true Soul Food Restaurants in the valley. They wouldn't honor their groupon! SHAME ON YOU!#!"}
{"text":"Y'all, I'm torn on this one.

The chicken was well seasoned (borderline too salty, but I like salt...it's one of the staple spices of Ohio) and all dark meat, which is what I like. The mac and cheese was good, especially the chunks of real cheddar. The greens were okay--rather plain and not enough smokiness or heat for my liking. I'm not a fan of cornbread, so the muffin was lost on me. And the millionaire's pie, while very tasty, was quite pricy. But it filled me up; I cleaned my plate and ate with my fingers, making certain to get all of the moist flesh I could gnaw off the bone and practically linked the plate for that crispy skin. And since I was the only customer in there at that time (the only other patron was finishing her dinner as I entered, and she ordered two desserts to go, one for her brother. Such a sweet sister! That's directed at you, Jodi.)

As you may have guessed, I was house sitting in the area. And I  have been craving good fried chicken, ever since that fiasco at Tom's Tavern downtown when they served me up deep fried and broiled chicken leather. Gah! At least the chicken at BeBe's was redeeming. The best I've ever had? Well, it's Arkansas style cooking. I'm a Lo-Lo's guy, for sure. Different style, right. So, was it bad? No, not really. With some hot sauce, it hit the right heat-point. Hot sauce also aided the mac and cheese. I wanted spicy vinegar for my greens (yo, Lo-Lo's) and more ham hock flavor. But, wait: I'm not at Lo-Lo's. That's not necessarily faith to BeBe's. And all the great things that have come out of Arkansas. Like, am I right?

Service was good, not overly attentive (I dislike hovering people. That's directed at you, ::insert specific family members here::). I've grown accustomed to the aloof presence of Millenials. But I scored a BOGO coupon. Is that how the kids are saying buy 1 get 1 free? Will I use it? Certainly. They have catfish on the menu, so I'll give that a shot.

Ultimately, if you go in expecting a Lo-Lo's experience, you may be disappointed. But if you go in with neutral expectations...well then..."}
