{"text":"This is a pleasant, outdoor showcase for McAuslin's beer. It has a very simple menu, hamburgers, sausages and tofu.   The ambiance is like a very relaxed barbeque. It is very kid friendly and regularly has families pulling up on bicycles.  It closes early, at 21h00 but you can now drift over to the Annexe pub which is equally enjoyable but is open later and is more 'pub-like'.  I'm an unabashed fan, so bear in mind I really like craft beer, and a come-as-you are ambiance. If you are looking for conventional drinks or a broader menu, you might not be satisfied.   The Terrasse St-Ambroise does what it does very well."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite ones to take a beer and relax! It is by the lachine canal so you can also take a nice walk before/after taking a nice beer. They offer different types of beers and also seasonal ones. If you plan to go as a big group don't worry you will always have space to sit and enjoy your time!  Cet endroit est un de mes préférés pour prendre une bière et relaxer! Situé sur le bord du canal lachine... Parfait pour prendre une marche avant ou après une bonne bière. La brasserie mcauslan offre une grande variété  de bières. Il y a même un choix de bières  saisonnières. Si vous planifiez y aller avec plusieurs personnes vous n'avez pas à vous inquiéter il y aura assez d'espace pour vous accueillir!"}
{"text":"I can't even believe they actually sell frozen undercooked burger patties and stale buns as overpriced burgers. The food is absolutely atrocious -- one of the worst ever in my life. If you go there to enjoy some beer, please do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The St-Ambroise terrasse is nice and located right along a lock on the Lachine Canal. That is really the only thing going for it though.   Their beer is mediocre at best. And it will cost you more to buy it five feet from where it is brewed than most bars in the city sell it for.   The service is ok. Cocky young 20 year old types who would obviously rather be anywhere but there.   The burgers are garbage and the \"chips & salsa\" means the broken ends at the bottom of a bag with such a small amount of salsa you run out before getting halfway through the pile of crumbs you paid for.   The owner/manager guy walks around looking miserable and giving people shit about having dogs even though they claim to be dog friendly. Such a bad vibe fellow.  I don't know. It just seems like a much better idea to buy some good Quebecois beer (like Dieu Du Ciel or À l'Abri de la Tempête); hitting up the Atwater Market for some real locally sourced food; and sitting along the canal away from this place. At least that way you won't be subject to the shittiest bar music in Montreal."}
{"text":"Met a new friend at Dieu de Ciel and he recommended this place. SWEET! So happy that he did. It's about a ten/fifteen minute walk from the subway but totally worth it. Walk along the waterfront to take a leisurely walk! Plus, I came in through the other side of the street and could NOT find the opening to the terrace for the life of me!! You need signs directing people McAuslan!!  Anyways, the terrace has a beer garden-like setup and you can purchase basic bar food i.e. hamburgers, hot dogs, chips and salsa, etc. We started with the beer sampler to get our taste buds working and I fell in love with the raspberry ale! Also really enjoyed their apricot ale and their DIPA, which my boyfriend is now calling the the Pliny of Quebec. Definitely a spot worth coming to if you enjoy beer!"}
{"text":"A bit off the very busy Notre dame street but far enough that you're guaranteed to always find a spot. They offer the regular Mcauslan beers as well as some specialty beers brewed on spot only. The pale ale Mac and cheese is sinfully good. Butter Chicken pie is another hit. Quiet enough that you can have a normal conversation without yelling or using signs to communicate. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"We ended up here at the end of a bike tour. There is plenty of space outside and quite an unique view of an old factory.  The staff was friendly and offered us multiple tastes of their various beers. I had the Session IPA which was tasty but the best on by far was the Apricot ale. It's not too sweet while maintaining just the right amount flavor. Definitely try that beer first.   It's surely worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood and good enough of a brewery to justify a trip out there if you are not."}
{"text":"Great brewery, we took the tour (interesting!) and had a tasting (interesting and tasty!).  Afterwards we hung around the terrace a bit.  Everyone was very friendly.  I think their website says they only do yours on Wednesday, so check and reserve before you go.  If you're going to go, you can walk along the water instead of on the streets of this factory neighborhood.  We only realized this once we were already there.  If you've ever wanted to see where McAuslan was made, this is the place to go.  If you've ever wanted to see where Moosehead Lager was made, they actually make it here, too (for Quebec)."}
{"text":"Yes it is in a sketch part of town. But! The beer is great and a knowledgeable passionate group of people await to tell you about the brewing process. Not sure of tasting hours and what not but I went here for a tasting event and enjoyed everything from the Blonde to the oatmeal stout."}
{"text":"The bathroom is finally opened!  Yay!  Last time I had 2x20oz cidre and had to walk REALLY really fast to back home :)  At least it's EXTREM emergency situation, I can't let myself to use the portable toilets.. just I can't!  Anyway it's not the cast anymore, more beer for me now.  Try the pink cider.  It's delicious and so very refreshing after nice walk on Lachine canal~ The raspberry beer is very good too - It's not like Lambic, not sweet at all but just the nice smell.  The apricot is good too but the smell is little too over powering - but dry..   So see you around at this place when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"The McAuslan's terrasse is an awesome place to enjoy throughout the summer time for great beer and really laid back, cool, company! I came with a few friends for the Funk n Jazz Festival, which was awesome. The line ups for beer and BBQ deliciousness were quite long but seemed to pass at a decent pace, I felt more bad for the guys taking care of everyone's orders in the scorching heat.   Not sure if it was solely this time around or something they finally introduced, but they were accepting credit/debit cards!   (But seriously, why don't you guys EVER have Framboise on tap for me?! Now I have to wait til next year...)"}
{"text":"The St-Ambroise Apricot Ale must be the best \"fruity\" beer I've had. Great sweet and subtle aroma, and simple smooth taste. It's not very tart for those who like strong beers. Faith in fruity beers regained.  The Scotch Ale is a darker stronger 7.5% beer that was extremely smooth and sweet. Low carbonation, and comfortable to swallow. It's one of McAuslan's highest-rated beers on RateBeer so give it a try!  Finally, the Rasberry Ale was a bit uninspiring compared to the Apricot Ale. It's neither sweet nor malty, hints of a watered-down cocktail more than a beer. But for those who don't like beer, by all means try one.  A 12oz glass is $5 and the 20oz is only $6 tax included - there's no reason not to stop by the terrace and replenish if you pass by on the bike path."}
{"text":"So besides the amazing size terasse is there any other reason to come here ?  Decided to try this place out because well all the terasse around here are meh and wanted something large and awesome. We got nothing more then that.   It's self serve and I get it because the place is HUGE. You would need 5 +waiters/waitress to keep an eye on Everyone. Nobody wants to stand up waiting for beer when you come to kick it and relax in the sun.  Food     Hamburger= 9$ .. (no sides) Dry. Veggie wrap= around same price & cold Cauliflower salad=7.50, went in the garbage.  You are better to stuff your belly down the street before or after because it's not cheap to eat here and you won't enjoy it both Taste wise and money wise.  Beer is good, two pints of pale ale $12.00 Nothing I haven't heard of so price I'm used to. If I were you order pitchers and leave it on a shady table on the terasse because getting up to get a beer sucks and you'll keep your beer cold.  Would 100 percent come back just wouldn't eat anything and would stick with pitchers. Also after 5 it gets busy so come quick."}
{"text":"There's nothing like seating outside on a warm summer's day and having a cold one! The terrace on Saint-Ambroise is a really nice rest stop when biking on the canal, and worth a visit if you are in Saint-Henri area. During summer this place  measures up with any Montreal bar. The large outdoor terrace is a heaven for those looking to relax and kick back. They serve several beers on tap and some cheap pub grab. Just wonderful! Unfortunately it's hard to get here by public transportation (it's at least 10 minutes walk to the nearest metro). You are better off driving or riding your bike over. The parking lot is on the Saint-Ambroise street side, and the bike rakes are on the canal's side. Santé!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to drink in the summer time and now I can go whenever I want because they recently opened a bar inside, literally a two minute walk from the terrasse to the bar.  The terrasse is awesome, right of the bike path on the Lachine Canal. There's always a great ambiance, with live bands, people are there with their friends, their kids and their dogs. The terrasse is huge and it's always packed. The beer is awesome, my favorite is their apricot beer and their cider! Nothing more refreshing on a hot summer day. Their food is good too, nothing amazing, but keep in mind it's a bar. Burgers, veggies burgers, chips & salasa and euro hot dogs. The burgers and hotdogs come with chips & salsa too. Again, it's not a restaurant.   The inside bar is really nice. Made to look like an old irish pub. Their menu inside is a little different. First there was no cider on the menu, apparently they don't know if the cider will be coming back. The food well you have a choice of a Pretzel with two kinds of mustard which they sale jars of if you want to take some home, it's delicious, their beer dijon mustard especially. And you also have Nachos with jalapeno, black olives and pineapple (i know pineapples on nachos sounds weird, but it's really good).   St-Ambroise is really one of my favorite places to go to."}
{"text":"Hit the terrace after a long bike ride, which was one of my better life choices. Great outdoor atmosphere, friendly staff, plenty of velo parking, dog and child friendly. And obviously, DELICIOUS BEER.   There's a tasting paddle for $12, which doesn't come with a huge amount of beer, but if you're genuinely trying to make up your mind before ordering a delicious 12oz-er or pint, they'll let you taste anything. Pints average around $7, depending on what beer you get. They have some specialties. (I totally recommend the apricot and I don't even usually like fruity beers.)   So I'm taking off one star for the snacks, which were really really really average. We split a burger and some chips with salsa, and while the burger meat was actually decent, the chips were totally straight from a bag and kind of stale, and I dunno, the whole thing kind of lacked finesse. I would love to see them just bring the grill up a single notch and it would be perfect.  This is a wonderful thing to do if you have guests in town (which we did) as the brewery is not too far away from anything and is a fantastic pre- or post- (or both) stop along an intense bike ride."}
{"text":"What a great place to spend a nice summer day in Montreal. This terrasse is fabulous - there is a main bar where you can get beers, a food stand, wifi (although weak),  outdoor tables (some in the shade) with great views of the water. For those not from Montreal and without a car, you may need to take the public bus here and walk through the parking lot to enter. Otherwise there are plenty of bikers who just leave their bike and grab a couple of brews with friends. I'm glad I found this terrasse. Somewhat in the same area as the Atwater Market for those visiting."}
{"text":"This is a really fun little place. Right on the canal. You can go for a pleasant bike ride and then pull in for a couple gallons of beer and a hot dog. Then you can get back on your bike and try not to ride straight into the canal;)   But seriously, if you're in the area, stop in! They have a beer tasting rack that comes with every beer they make. but you might want to wait for spring to come back around!"}
{"text":"What a great place to have some great beers! Even though it is a little out of the way, it's definitely worth the trip. They've got beers for all seasons and decent snacks to go with. They bar itself is homely and reminiscent of an old timey pub, which is a good thing. If you're sampling the microbrew scene in Montréal, this is a worthy stop."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best things about summer is McAuslan's terrasse! It's a community affair and everyone is after the same things: Sun, Relaxation, Laughs, Music and of course Beer from St-Ambroise!  Picture this:  Friday afternoon, people of all ages, great social vibe, english and french mix, and live music - right next to the Lachine Canal.  This terrasse is accessible by foot, bike, rollerblades, skateboard, car (big free parking lot) and located just west of St-Remi on St-Ambroise, and has an entrance off the bike path.   It can get crowded, and your drinks may take a while, but the atmosphere is unbeatable and is quite the little gem of St-Henri. They have BBQ foods available but don't expect a grand variety. As each year goes by, they have added a bit more to the place. Downside: porta-potties, upside: at least they have many of them to help curb bathroom times.   It is still a cash only establishment, so don't forget to stop off at the ATM!"}
{"text":"The beer is decent, and the location is awesome. Such a great place to chill, and you can incorporate it into a nice walk or bike ride cause it's right on the river.bPerfect place to savor an evening. Plus, it's puppy friendly!!"}
{"text":"The terrasse is a wonderful place to spend a summer evening enjoying a great pint of beer. Currently they have an AMAZING apricot beer that is so refreshing! I tried several different beers while at the brewery and I was not disappointed in any of them. One warning, the kitchen closes a little early, like 9:30 or so. If you want something to chew on while enjoying your pints, then order your food early."}
{"text":"We were biking on the Canal Lachine and we decided to stop for a nice cold beer and maybe some food. The beer St-Ambroise is very good especially the Apricot beer! For any reason, I had cider that day, the \"pink\" one and 3 glass later and 2 bags of BBQ chips, I was craving a burger. We had the burger and hotdog, super juicy and delicious!!! The pickle jar goes low at the end of the day so you have to hurry up! One con would be that the service is slow, you could be waiting 20 minutes before you get to the only bartender, so you need to prepare and stack up!  Can't wait to go back. The location is perfect, on the biking path plus there was a Raegae music band that played from 5 to 7.....it was simply perfect! All kind of people and age. You can also drive to the place, there is plenty of parking!!"}
{"text":"My original five star review for McAuslan and specifically for its amazing terrace got somehow transferred under the Annex. So here I'm writing another five star review for the BEST beer garden in Montreal. It is simple, unpretentious, relaxed, friendly towards kids, pets, bikers and everybody else, and it makes people happy, or at least it makes me happy, and I believe it makes my friends and relatives happy. I'm happy when they open in the late spring and I'm jumping on my bike to get there with the ultimate goal to drink my first apricot pint in celebration of the approaching summer. I'm happy when my sweet heart orders another pint of IPA and raves about it, and we put our big smiles on our faces. I'm happy when my friends order a pitcher of cream ale as it is one of the most elaborate beers ever made. I have a very happy picture of my mom sitting in front of one of these six glass tasting boards. I'm even happier when the fall approaches because it means there will be pumpkin brew as it is the best I have tried and I have tried a lot. I only regret the maple season is during the winter and I can't drink the most amazing maple ale at the terrace. And this is all I have to say! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic terrasse, right next to the canal. Decent beer at an okay price. It's a bit out of the way, but it's one of the best terrasses in the city on sunny days, and is large enough to avoid being overly crowded much of the time."}
{"text":"This place is only open in the warmer months, so enjoy it while you can! Just off the canal bike/walk path, it's a great place to have a great beer outside (preferably in great weather). This is where they brew MacAuslan beer in Montreal.  There's not too much in the way of food here, so come well fed if you want to get your drink on and not get too messy... Maybe that's just me. Sometimes they make burgers but not always, other than that they just have potato chips. The Atwater market isn't a far walk down the canal (and it's a nice walk too) if you need real food."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my friend and his dog a lot. I like that it's dog friendly and it's a chill place to go for beers especially on a nice sunny day or warm night. I hadn't been back yet this summer. So I went back yesterday with my colleagues and I was so impressed with the renovations that they did. It's so much nicer now. There's less picnic tables and I like that they added the bean bag toss game for people to play. I did pretty well!  Normally I just come and have a pitcher of beer but this time I had their food too. My boyfriend and I ordered the pumpkin beer pitcher. My favorite kind of beer is a white (blanche) beer but unfortunately St Ambroise doesn't make any. :( The pumpkin one is good though. I've tried most of their beers but I won't go into that because I'm biased and will drink pretty much anything.   We shared the cheeseburger and the hot dog. You can add whatever condiments you choose and they have a big range such as ketchup, mayo, mustard, relish, pickle, jalapeño, and like a ranch type sauce. They both came with a side of nachos and salsa. It's more expensive to get the nachos but it's so worth it. The nacho chips are big and the salsa is homemade. We asked for extra salsa because they give way more chips than salsa.   I will definitely keep coming back and I recommend it. I heard their pizza is good but unfortunately the pizza station was closed when we went so I gotta go back and try that."}
{"text":"Nous étions quelques collègues et nous avons fait le tour de l'usine. Le ''guide'' était vraiment motivant et on sentait sa passion pour l'entreprise. Nous avons appris quelques trucs cool sur la bière et sa confection. Je crois qu'il faut réserver à l'avance pour une visite. Nous avons commandé le plateau de Rosette de Lyon, les huîtres et les nachos et tout était très bon. La bière est vraiment pas cher, parfait pour un 5 à 7 entre collègues! Le menu de L'annexe est très simple et ne contient pas beaucoup de choix. J'ai commandé la soupe à l'oignon mais ils n'en avaient pas :("}
{"text":"La plupart des gens qui commentent font référence à la Terrasse St-Ambroise, située du côté sud de la brasserie, et qui donne sur la piste cyclable du canal Lachine.  L'endroit qui fait davantage battre mon coeur est l'Annexe St-Ambroise, soit le pub dont l'entrée se trouve sur la rue du même nom. J'ai la chance d'habiter très près et ce sont les soirs de semaine qui font que j'y retourne. La réputation de la bière n'est plus à faire. Le pub est juste suffisamment animé, c'est à dire que vous pourrez y tenir une conversation sans crier mais que vous ne vous sentirez pas seuls et mal à l'aise :) De plus, les jeudis, il y a un DJ qui fait jouer des disques vinyles. Je me rappelle y avoir entendu des classiques motown au moins à deux reprises ce qui me plaisait beaucoup. Il doit y avoir environ 50 places assises mais l'aménagement est créé de manière à ce que tous trouvent un coin qui leur convient, soit sur des grandes tables de groupes, au bar, sur des chaises, sur des banquettes et, ce que je préfère, dans deux espèces de \"booth\" plus discrèts.   Finalement, la nourriture est okay, mais le menu est court, alors je préfère manger ailleurs et n'y aller que pour une pinte."}
{"text":"Afternoons here on the terrasse are so Montreal in food, beer, and atmosphere.  Apple Cider Du Minot White + Vegeburger"}
{"text":"great view, absolutely zero service, it's a self serve system where you go buy your beer and you have to stand there the whole time waiting for it. For them it's totally more profitable but for the costumer is ridiculous.  The nachos were ok, sauce is a bit spicy, there was a couscous salad doesn't taste much and the pulled pork tacos where actually pretty good. The hog dog not impressive besides its size suppose to taste like beer but it doesn't."}
{"text":"La brasserie McAuslan offre pendant l'été accès à sa terasse qui donne vue sur le Canal Lachine. Endroit parfait pour s'arrêtér pendant une promenade en vélo pour se rafraîchir avec leur fameuse bière Saint-Ambroise aux abricots. Elle ferme un peu tôt (21h) mais c'est une belle découverte bien cachée."}
{"text":"Came here for the funk & jazz afternoon yesterday and the conditions were perfect: the sun was shining, there was plenty of room on the grass for everyone, the music was great and the beers and BBQ grub were fantastic. My only complaint is that the beer queue got out of hand a few times with only 3 staff members busting their asses as fast as they could, but I forgive it seeing as it was 30 degrees+ and everyone was collectively thirsty. Oh and seriously, pleeeeease stop running out of the framboise, it's seriously good shit and it's a long trek to get to the brewery! Make more, I dunno :P"}
{"text":"Nice setting and odd seasonal beers.  Service was good and everyone just seemed happy to be there.  The setting is outstanding, but you need to know this is around, or you're likely to ever know it was there.  It's nice to see Montreal still has its \"off the beaten path\" type establishments."}
{"text":"I love st.ambroise beer, so I was happy to visit here! We went inside the annex because it was too chilly to hang out on the terrace. There were posters all over the bar advertising their tangerine IPA, so we were excited to try it! Too bad our waiter informed us they didn't have any left... which makes no sense to me since their beer is literally brewed right next door... we asked if they had their raspberry beer in stock, same story. There were a couple of other beers they also didn't have in stock despite them being on the menu. We were then informed that the terrace had all these beers in stock and if we wanted them so bad we should go there... how does that make any sense!? We ate some cheese inside (which was awesome!) And had some tasters of basically the only beer they had in stock... finished and went to the cold as hell terrace to try the tangerine beer. When we informed the barman that for some reason they didnt cary it indoors, he promptly said \" the organization here makes no sense.\" That told me everything I needed to know. Good beer but terrible organization and service."}
{"text":"Amazing terrasse just front of water and bike path (canal lachine) parking for bicycles and many tables all around, some trees and amazing view of the sky ;) !"}
{"text":"During the summer, the Terrasse St-Ambroise is my favourite place in the city. Beyond the normal diversity of people you would find on any montreal patio, the addition of kids and dogs enjoying the terasse gives the place a special community vibe that is as rare as it is wonderful.   The limited menu of BBQ available is great both in terms of taste and price, and is readily available when you find yourself a bit peckish.   Follow the terrasse on facebook as they have special events and movie nights.   Watching Point Break on a warm summer night, projected onto a delivery truck with tragically wonderful french subtitles has been one of my favourite experiences in the city and could only be had in Montreal (the disparity between the rendering of colorful metaphors in the english dialogue and the French subtitles adds an extra layer of humour)."}
