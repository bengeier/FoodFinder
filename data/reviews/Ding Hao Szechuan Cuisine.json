{"text":"Trying out this spicy szcheuan place my parents told me about.  If you go, be sure to skip right to to the last few pages of the menu, their traditional dishes so much better.  Got the noodles and dumplings, that numbing feeling is what I remember, but could use a tiny bit more salt, otherwise pretty damn good, would come back for sure"}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant one night with my friend and asked if they made ma pa po tofu. I had enjoyed this dish in shanghai during a business trip but had been disappointed in versions in Canada. To my surprise this restaurant made the dish just as I remember. I have been to this restaurant 4 times now and every time I order from the Authentic dishes. I am vegetarian and they have many options for myself and also for my non vegetarian friend. I would recommend this restaurant. Prices are reasonable and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Great spicy Szechuan food, very traditional Cheng Du City cuisine."}
{"text":"Stick to their Szechuan menu, their spicy dishes are on point!  The rest of the Chinese food is pretty Westernized.

Go for the SPICY WONTONS, that chili flavor lingers in your mouth for minutes.  SPICY GREEN BEANS WITH MINCED MEAT is also on point. 

Noodles weren't great, maybe will try fried rice next time.

Service is great, very attentive and wow, the food came fast and furious!!  It was cool, as soon as we ordered, we could hear the big stoves being fired up in the back.  The restaurant is a bit quiet, need to turn on some music in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food. Came here for lunch and the \"Canadian\" Chinese food was just done right. More traditional Chinese menu available and will be back to try the spicy kind."}
{"text":"nice restaurant with true Szechuan cuisine, try 3 tropical spicy dishes. If you looking for spicy Szechuan cuisine, you should come."}
