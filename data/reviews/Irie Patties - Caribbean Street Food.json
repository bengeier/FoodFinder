{"text":"Great food and excellent. The jerk chicken wrap is amazing, and pretty healthy. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant word of mouth. I typically get my Caribbean food fix from Taste of Jamaica in Cleveland Heights.  I went with the jerk chicken.  The large jerk was worth the $8 (which is $2 less then the competition), it was a solid meal, but unfortunately it did not pound for pound touch the same dish at Taste of Jamaica.  Good cost effective meal, but not on the level of Taste Of Jamaica."}
{"text":"In town on Business and had a taste for Jamaican Cuisine..looked al over and ended up here. Not a fan of Mall Food but they have won me over! Polite and Friendly service, Food was off the chain and the portion size was way over a single serving. I'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken!!!  Really enjoy the cabbage and fried plantains as well!!  For $8 you get a lot of food!"}
{"text":"How have I not seen this place before? Good food, big portions, good prices. What more do I need to say? BTW, I had the stewed chicken and beef patty."}
{"text":"After returning from a birthday trip to Jamaica in 2014, I've had a soft spot for Jamaican meat patties and jerk. Fortunately, Irie Patties is located close to my office so I often stop by to pick up dinner on my way home from work. The service is excellent though the owner is a bit shy (don't let this deter you, he is really great!) and the food is delicious. The portions are substantial and the prices represent a great value. I would put this place a very close second to Taste of Jamaica in CleHts, but ToJ is more annoying to get to for me and only accepts cash, so I am very glad Irie Patties has stuck around."}
{"text":"After hearing that the jerk salad was good I decided to try it out for myself. The first time I went here when they first opened I was not pleased with the food at all but I decided to try it again.   Beef logo say, I once again was not pleased with even the salad. It included jerk chicken, onions, cucumbers, mangos and cheese. The dressing options were ranch and a raspberry vinaigrette. I really think the dressing would have possibly  made it better if there were more options to choose from.   I give it three stars because they had plantains and they were great along with the customer service.   I would not make a special trip to Richmond Mall just to eat here though."}
{"text":"This place has the best Jamaican food in the county.  I've visited many times in the past, but decided to leave a review after my last visits; two days in a row.  The food is cooked to perfection and they give generous portions.  I take quality over quantity, any day.   I'm just happy to have both in abundance at this establishment.  My favorites are the brown stewed chicken, plantains and beef patties.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"got the large oxtail meal here. think it cost 12 dollars. large heaping serving of delicious oxtail, rice and peas and cabbage. also got a chicken patty to go. the patty was yummy and authentic. the cabbage was a tad salty. plantains were good. will be back to try the jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Owner refused to accept a Restaurant.com coupon I purchased one day ago."}
{"text":"Irie patties is located in Richmond mall.I have to tell you this is one of the best Caribbean restaurants I have been to the food is fresh.The prices are great you're paying a reasonable price for home cooked food it's better than any restaurant in Richmond mall I hope this place stays around for awhile the owner is very nice and friendly. He is very helpful this is one of my go-to spots weekly. My favorite here is the jerk chicken plate. Come Here and try for yourself."}
{"text":"Good food! Had the jerk chicken with plaintains, red beans and rice and cabbage. Large portions and great price.  I opted for stewed chicken gravy on my 2nd trip back instead of jerk gravy n enjoyed it more.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant at the food court in the Richmond Mall. The food is fresh and delicious. I got the curry chicken dinner with plantains and cabbage. I would make a trip to the mall just to eat here."}
{"text":"Wow, in a mall, but the food is amazing, and they will accommodate your eating preferences. i advised i like spicy food. They cut  up a habenero  pepper for me. Wow, really who the fuk does that, in a mall none the less.  Curry chicken wast great, so much food and very tasty. I only ordered the chicken and a side of cabbage.  Fantastic. They used chicken thigh. really/ so impressed, for some reason it is hard to find a place that understands chicken breast  is horrible.   Ire puts out a great product, crazy good and it is in a mall in Richmond HTS.  Run. do not walk, t AND you will be happy  Fantastic food by people who are super cool. Sorry for being so cheesy."}
{"text":"Awesome Curry Chicken!! I came back 2 days later and the chef recognize me Haha!!! For $6.00 you get a lot of food. They also have jerk chicken and oxtail ! Have to give it a try even though they're in a mall. Best mall food I ever tasted."}
{"text":"Very good fall off the bone jerk chicken at an extremely reasonable price.   It comes with rice and beans, cabbage, and plantains.   Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food I've had outside of Jamaica. My favorite is the curry chicken but everything else is great too. The only downside is the location I would like to get my food without a Charley's subs employee shoving a sample in my face."}
{"text":"\"Good fowl sey im a guh a market, senseh seh im a guh to\" is what I usually say about Yelpers but this place is me all day.  Honest, good and cooked with soul.  In the food court of Richmond mall that is basically dying.  Only thing left is sports apparel stores and random cellphone places.  Drove here after work just to try this place and I didn't mind the 35 minutes back to the West side either.  Started off with the middle of the road jerk chicken.  They have curry and oxtails which I will try next time for sure.  Dark meat chicken with red beans and rice.  Side of plantains.  All for about 8 bux.  It was so big I ate half in the mall and and Im heating up the rest as we speak.  Ask for extra jerk sauce.  It tastes like my own when I make it at home.  People were coming in the mall just to get food here and go.  Hands down the best reason to come here.  Everything served in styrofoam to-go.  Only gripe is that it could of been a tad warmer and spicier.  But its really damn good.  So all you pothead, Bob Marley folk trying to re-live your college days and suburban Rastas come here and Livey Up Yourself.  You will love it..."}
{"text":"I went there today, and had their Jerk Mac and Cheese \"meal,\" which consisted of just some shredded jerk chicken over generic mac and cheese. Naturally, I figured that since this was a meal, it would come with rice, plantains, and cabbage like their other meals. At least, that's what you would assume from looking at the menu. Apparently, that's \"not the case.\" There was nothing on the menu saying as much, and the guy at the counter absolutely refused to acknowledge that it could be confusing, mumbling a few words and shrugging his shoulders. The food itself was ok, but nothing worth going out of your way for. Save your money and time for something else.  Oh, and right before I got my food, another customer brought his salad back with some complaints, so this doesn't seem like an isolated thing. I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Boy! This place is Great. I was visiting from Toledo!  Ordered the Mango Salad!! So amazing and tropical and healthy!! Get the vinegraet dressing too! Will recommend to all people alive!! this place is located inside the Food Court inside the Mall!! Staff was polite and helpful!!"}
{"text":"I ordered an oxtail combo which came on top of red beans and rice, with a side of cabbage and plantains.Okay..Man let me tell yall I don't know what other people are talking about but the oxtails n rice was so bland I didn't try to finish it! The cabbage was the only thing seasoned in the combo! Did not taste at ALL like Jamaican/Caribbean flavored oxtails n rice! I also ordered a beef patty which was the best tasting out of the whole meal. Will not return food is not good, What kind of place doesn't at least add a little salt?? The one star is for the cabbage and beef patty. I wonder if Daily's on 116th is still open? Now the have good authentic food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the food court of Richmond Mall and serves street food that you would find in the Caribbean. The food tastes fresh, delicious and is relatively healthy.  The counters and food areas are kept clean.  Some of the menu items are stewed chicken,  oxtails,  jerk chicken,  pepper steak,  plantains,  rice and beans,  cabbage,  curry chicken and you will get large portions of each.  Be sure to try the plantains!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Caribbean food!! I had the Oxtails and they were delicious. The beans and rice with the oxtail gravy was so good also. The plantains were a little over done, but decent. I really enjoyed the cabbage, reminds me of a restaurant in DC. The server and cashier were both very friendly!! Good food for a great price. Portions were really good!!"}
{"text":"I believe the food here is good for the mall. I think other reviewers are ignoring that fact. (Irie Patties is a made to order restaurant similar to a mall Asian restaurant) I order the oxtails, jerk chicken salad and chicken curry meal. I do agree that the rice can use a little more flavor/spice and I'm not a fan of the chicken curry (it's very bland to me), but those will be my only complaints. The salad is very fresh and made to order. Romaine lettuce with veggies/fruit (tom, mangoes, red onion, cucumbers) cheese and jerk chicken. The jerk chicken had the perfect spice to me and is very tender. The oxtails are also very tender and are not spicy at all. The cabbage and plantains are my favorite and they come with every meal. I have been her many of times and will continue!!!!"}
{"text":"As a person of Caribbean background, it's difficult finding good Caribbean food in Cleveland. I'm so glad to have been introduced to Irie Patties, the food is always on point!"}
{"text":"Was a little weirded out that my foodie boyfriend wanted to grab some mall food but the place was backed by the Yelp community so I knew it had integrity. Unfortunately for a mall location the menu is limited but I'll describe what I had:  Ordered a large chicken curry meal which came with rice mixed with beans, steamed cabbage and fried plantains. For $8 this was a massive heap of nutrition. Plantains were cooked perfectly. Curry chicken was not super impressive but still tasty. For a carb free option skip the rice and just get a the cabbage which I felt paired well with the chicken and curry.  Couldn't leave the place without trying its name sake. These little parties are just like Spanish empanadas just a little flatter. Beef inside was like a pulled pork. Nice snack.  The chef was kind to let us sample his other concoctions, oxtail and jerk chicken. The jerk chicken had a pleasant little spice kick which I wish I got instead. The oxtail were little bite sized nibblets and a little oily for me"}
