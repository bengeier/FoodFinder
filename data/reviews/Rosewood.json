{"text":"Patience, patience and more patience is what you need if you decide to go for Sunday brunch here. Even with a reservation we had to wait for about 20 minutes, though we had Coffee offered while we were waiting then we had to wait almost O N E hour for our food to come out and beleive me, it was worth it every single minute, the saulmon toast with avocado and the side order of panckakes were outstanding! Also the great and attentive service the barman gave us made our long wait fine. Because of the long waiting he managed to take out from our bill ALL beverages."}
{"text":"The food was meh and pricey for what you were given, but the Yellowfin burger was good. The service was irritating, taking plates and napkins from you before you have had the time to swallow you last bite (and there was no rush for our table at the time). Pushy with the drinks. Halfway through your cocktail they kept trying to take it away.

All in all ok but no more."}
{"text":"Belle terrasse intime. Cuisine plus qu'excellente, très raffinée. Superbe assiette de morue ce soir. Tacos au buf en entrée et bonne bière locale (du Archibald Québec). 
Service très parfait. Je recommande sans crainte!!"}
{"text":"Excellent drinks.   Good conversation.   Relaxing environment.   Polite bartenders & staff.    I didn't eat, but my friend thought his burger was delicious.    Music was festive.  Looks fairly subdued from the street, but I enjoyed my evening.   Tons of options in the area.  Give them a chance."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while looking for someplace that wasn't $40 per plate. The food here is great, and cocktails are even better. If Sam is bartending you are in for a treat, ask him for a a \"crossroad\". Also, the Cesar Japonais is a new delicious twist on a ceaser.  I wish I lived in Montreal, so I could be a regular. We were only here 4 nights, but we came back for our last night meal because it was so good!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the hotel Place D'Armes across the street, and had made plans to meet up with a friend at Rosewood due to its proximity to the hotel.  This place turned out to be my nemesis before I even stepped foot into it.  On both nights of my stay at the hotel, I could hear the band (mostly the drums and bass) and people hanging outside on the street smoking, and hooting and hollering. (The bar next door also contributed to the noise.) This went on until 1 or 2am each morning, interrupting my beauty sleep!

Anyway, not wanting the hassle of changing plans, I ended up here for a late lunch on a Sunday.  The space is interesting;  2 storeys, and an a-ha! for me when I noticed the stage is set up right in the front of the resto, thus explaining why I heard so much bass.

There was an interesting crowd here;  and despite it being afternoon, it was still busy.  Overall,  service was casual and friendly.  And the food was just OK;  nothing to write home about.  But after food arrived, we were checked on a few times to make sure everything was OK.  Sunday was their brunch menu, and I had the breakfast sandwich while my friend had the chicken and pancakes.  The breakfast sandwich was OK;  however, I wasn't asked whether I wanted bacon or sausage (and I had forgotten to specify when I ordered) and it defaulted to a sausage patty.  The chicken was nuggets and she said it was \"meh\" but the serving was a generous size.   While we didn't partake, many did order their bottomless mimosas.

An average meal, with an average price point.  While the food wasn't memorable, I will always remember this place as the cause of two nights of lost sleep due to their noisy customers!"}
{"text":"this place is the worst! the worst service ever! service so terrible and rude that it needs to be written! 

the staff here was rude and condescending and totally awful warranting this review.

first, the food .... alright for the price and presentation was just ok. it could have been presented better with probably a better attitude.

second, the service .... the worst!!! never go here if you want to be accused of something that was not your fault but still yelled at (in a condescending manner) therefore losing your appetite and unable to eat.

it took every fiber in my being not to throw the plate (after he dropped with without grace) right back at his face!! 

again, this place is the worst!!! do not go!"}
{"text":"I cant emphasize enough that the customer service goes above and beyond! Maybe it's because im from NY but the staff was fantastic.  My husband and i showed up without a reservation on a holiday weekend but they seated us right away, even though theyre usually a reservation only establishment. First of all, they had (strong) endless mimosas for $25. If that wasnt good enough, while the wait was unusually long for our food (winter holiday weekend in a ski area) they gave us a free bowl of fruit while we waited and a discount on the bill. The food was excellent. Our table was also in an awkward location so the bartender gave me a pitcher instead of constantly refilling my mimosas across the room. My husband and i could not be happier and would recommend Rosewood to anybody visiting the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! We came on Sunday hoping for lunch and found out they only do brunch on Sunday's but this ended up working out perfectly! I had the breakfast burger which came with a side of very fresh fruit and home fries I was very happy with all of it and it wasn't too big! I was able to finish the whole thing. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry pancakes which were gone within 3 minuets of our waitress setting them down. Bartender and staff are very friendly. Great noisy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! We had a to wait a short time on a Sunday for a table of two. The eggs Benedict were delicious and the bottomless mimosa was a nice add (they definitely made sure you get your fair share, continuously refilling)."}
{"text":"From the fantastic tunes and hip vibe, to the incredibly yummy eats, you can tell the staff at Rosewood is passionate about their craft (they are all very cool/friendly too). Try their homemade lemonade and unique cocktails: original, tasty, and fresh. Delicious food, lively atmosphere, and good company: all great reasons to go back!"}
{"text":"I've never had service so bad that I felt the need to write a review. The service for this restaurant was terrible and I can't believe there are people like this working in the service industry. I found a piece of hair in my avocado toast and politely let the waiter know and he was quick to apologize and said he'll get me a new plate right away. Mind you, the hair was MIXED in with the mashed avocado. I put my knife and fork in and the hair came to surface immediately. 

A different server came back with a new plate and said that he searched all over the kitchen and there was no one with 8 inch dark hair in the kitchen, insinuating that it was my hair in the food (my hair was tied up in a tight ponytail by the way) He then said that I should be careful because he could've charged me for two plates. Then he had the audacity to tell me to calm down when he was the one that was being accusatory and raising his voice. 

A apology and new plate of food would've solved the problem - I think this is pretty standard if a restaurant messes up an food order. We notified the manager and he said sorry but we could tell he it was not genuine when he started making excuses for his staff.

Giving this place a 1 star is generous."}
{"text":"Great team! The folks from joeverse have outdone themselves with this burger and beer joint in the old port. Totally a chilled place for drinks or food or both :)"}
{"text":"A great setting and amazing service. Weak beer selection.  Snacked,  but the food served looked and smelled delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped by Rosewood tonight for dinner and a few drinks while in town on business.

I really enjoyed my cocktail (Cherry Poppins) and the Burger Le Massif.  The cocktail was well-made; sweet, but not too sweet.  The burger was reasonably sized, but absolutely delicious.  Mmm, foie gras!

The place wasn't crowded (everyone was headed out to watch fireworks), the bartender was friendly and struck up a conversation.  There was a also a really good movie (Almost Famous) playing on the TVs with subtitles.

Strong work, Rosewood.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"DO NOT come here if you want to leave feeling like a decent human being, the kitchen staff will come out personally and accuse you of wrong doing - expecting to have a none confrontational brunch was too much to ask! 

We had made a reservation for twelve people on a Sunday morning, the place was still quiet. When the food came, my friend had pulled out a long piece of hair only 2 bites in, it wasn't laid on top of the food, we saw her pull it out from within the sandwich with food stuck to it. She quietly placed it back onto the plate and pointed this out to a wait-staff, he took it away and said another one would come right out. 
Then, the star of our story, a kitchen staff personally brought over the new plate, and said 'I checked this plate and made sure there was no hair in it, also checked that none of the waitstaff has long hair, so just be careful this time.' We asked for clarification, did he just accuse us of putting hair in the food?!!?
He repeated himself again, in a less subtle manner this time: 'I'm just saying that there is no one in the kitchen with 8 inch long black hair, but I'm looking around the table (12 females with hair) and just be glad we are not charging you for this 2nd plate.' 

WHOAH, WHOAH, WHOAH. At this point, we all lost our appetite. THE NERVE! There was no need for accusation, we were not whaling about finding a hair in the food in the first place as if trying to scam the establishment out of a free meal, also, it is a waste of food & time on us to 'claim' there was hair just for a fucking new plate. It was very unprofessional as a service establishment to accuse their customers of being criminals. 

If you want to know about the actual taste of the food, it was only subpar. My salmon on the avocado toast was dry, and I didn't think a sandwich of this nature could be flavorless, but it was def on the bland side, so get your hot-sauce ready!
The waiter pushed for the house cinnamon buns as a 'starter', it turned out pretty good.

Lets hope you won't run the risk of dealing with that egoistic prick from the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas is what I came for!! Cute little place, great food.  I had the breakfast sandwich.  Great service & such nice people."}
{"text":"First place we stopped at when getting into Montréal. First walking in it seemed like it'd be a great/ fun place to have Sunday brunch. Had bottomless mimosa which was really bottomless OJ with a tad of champagne. The Bartender was more interested in showing everyone he was hip than helping customers. Food was pretty good though... if they don't have what's on the menu, don't worry!If you are at the bar the bartender will take 10 minutes explaining the replacement and how unique it is."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on our trip. Ambience was very unique and hipster. Cult classic movies on (no sound) and music kept the noise level high but not to the point where you couldn't hear each other. The food was great, we shared 3 plates and non disappointed. Def worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I hardly give a 5 but when I do it's because a business is amazing and the service too. I am a Vegan and they had very limited options for me. I was with a group so I had decided to stay and just have whatever I could find. 

The kitchen came out and said they would make something extra special for me. I have no idea what it was but it was super amazing !! They also have us great starters to try as well and free shooters. 

I loved the upstairs and the great seating. It is very busy on Sundays with their unlimited mimosa's but it's a great vibes and wonderful staff. There is street parking and in the lot outside. Great bathrooms and they also have live music throughout the week."}
{"text":"Great vibe and atmosphere. Food was alright -- the Cheesesteak Montrealais was interesting, but not as flavourful as I would have thought. The Le Massif burger was fantastic, though. Fries were delicious. Poutine was interesting -- brandy in the gravy and made with some sort of veal -- either veal stock, veal fat, or with veal in the gravy itself.

Beer selection is decent, and all are priced the same. No pitchers, just 64 oz. growlers -- looks cool, but not very practical for pouring at first.

Prices seemed a little steep for portion size, but that may be status quo for the area.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Really cool environment with delicious cocktails. Interesting mixture of drinks and cool decorations. Came here for a nice cocktail before I headed back home. The cocktail was a gin cocktail with berries and herbs, really delicious, made fresh in front of you. Because it was a Sunday, it was a bit dead."}
{"text":"This is an off the beaten track place that you should absolutely try!  We went on a Sunday and they had unlimited mimosas for $25!   The food was hot and fresh and our server was super attentive and really nice.  Everyone who worked there said hello in passing-unexpected but so nice.  They were not terribly busy so they lost a star because our food took about 45 minutes.  It looked like there were only two people actually working in the kitchen but a lot of servers.  The food was good-the poutine is exceptional-it's not the normal street kind and was over home fries. They were a great twist on this favorite, plus the home fries by themselves were really really good too."}
{"text":"Love the space. Burgers were good but small. Expect to eat many things if you go for dinner. Drinks are great, they create their own sodas. Overall I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Rosewood is, as much as I wanted to love it, nothing special. 

Came here for a big birthday brunch where the entire top floor was essentially booked for us and I was underwhelmed since before we sat down. The restaurant made zero effort to create any type of cohesive seating arrangement to accommodate our group so we broke up into tables of 2-6 depending on availability. 

Apart from that, the bottomless mimosas were super diluted meaning that we paid $25 per person essentially for juice. And finally, the food was seriously lacking in taste. We were four people at our table, each having ordered something different: chicken sandwich, steak and eggs, breakfast sandwich, and the smoked salmon plate yet we all found our food extremely bland with two from our table even returning their food barely touched..... 

Honestly, wouldn't come back. Service was meh, prices are meh, food is meh... tons of other great places in the city to eat at. Sorry Rosewood!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, reasonable prices, and very delicious food.  They have bottomless Mimosas on Sunday for only $25 which my wife ordered and thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered the Breakfast Poutine. It was absolutely delicious and very filling. I highly reccomend this place, and I can't emphasize enough their high quality of food and customer service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the drinks were strong and tasty. We started with a charcuterie plate which had a lot to offer. My companion got the fish, which he rather enjoyed. I got the short rib, which was excellent! We also split the poutine. The gravy on the poutine was phenomenal, but the cheese curds were so cold and they were not in the slightest bit warm and melted. Definitely too much food for two people, but worth it. I drank the watermelon spritz, which was very tasty and refreshing! My only problem with this place is are the TV's. Our table was seated directly next to a TV which was playing a vey bizarre movie the whole time we were there. We were hoping for a more cozy dinner experience, but was hard to have while a bizarre movie is playing next to us."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, although it was quiet when we went. Great food, great service. 

Daily specials were great, and take advantage of the long happy hour. 

Great recommendations for items to accompany your meal."}
{"text":"Open on a Sunday. Fair selection of draft beer. Really not a Sports bar; they have one tv over the bar.  Limited Sunday menu of only breakfast fare.  No sports bar munchies. Nice people."}
{"text":"Endroit super cool pour  se retrouver entre amis après une journée  de travail! Bonne bouffe bonne bière!"}
{"text":"super chill vibe, friendly staff, cool decore. Wish I found this place sooner as I was staying across the street.  look it up."}
{"text":"Our day started off very nicely. Service was great, we felt like we were in for a great boozy brunch.
We had the bottomless mimosas, and food, 6 of us total. 
After the food was served, service got dramatically worse and worse. It took longer each time to get a refill on our mimosas, the longest we waited being 35 minutes after we specifically asked for a refill (to which the waitress replied \"when I get to it\". Meanwhile we watched the waitress dance, take shots, and play with a kinder surprise egg with other customers. Then we finally get champagne poured. But no orange juice. Waiting another 10 minutes for the orange juice, then over 20 minutes just to get our bill.
Poor service, poor attitude. I understand when a place is busy and under staffed, but a little courtesy goes a long way.
The table next to us (table of 3) realized that gratuity was added as a service fee on their bill (it was not on any of our bills) and had to argue to get it removed. 
Food was nothing special and they don't do substitutions (switch ham for bacon, etc). The Rosewood Famous breakfast was 2 over cooked eggs, 1 small sausage, 2 strips of bacon, a small square of ham, and the most over peppered handful of potatoes I've ever had, with 3 small slices of fruit, for $14.
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Ayant ouvert ses portes il y a quelques mois dans le Vieux Montréal, le Rosewood offre une ambiance rock chaleureuse parfaite pour les 5 à 7 entre amis ou entre collègues. Il y a de la place, les plats à la carte ont l'air super appétissants et les serveurs sont sympathiques. Les prix, un peu élevés pour certains trucs, sont meilleurs pour d'autres, notamment la bière. 

J'y suis allée pour un 5 à 7 avec des collègues. Même si nous étions nombreux, nous avons été servis assez rapidement. J'ai opté pour un burger de poulet et je n'ai vraiment pas été impressionnée. En fait, je n'ai pas aimé du tout; je n'ai pas terminé mon assiette. Tout le reste était délicieux, en passant par les grignotines (popcorn et bretzel avec sauce épicée au fromage, miam) jusqu'aux frites. Mes collègues ont aimé la nourriture, mais ont trouvé les prix assez élevés; il faut compter environ 14 $ pour un burger qui n'est accompagné que d'un minuscule bol de popcorn. Il faudra prendre une portion de frites à part pour combler son bedon ( 5$, je crois). Si on s'en tient à la bière et aux petites entrées, par contre, on s'en sortira avec une facture pas trop salée.

Ceux et celles qui n'aiment pas la musique trop forte n'aimeront pas trop la place, en tout cas, pas à l'heure des 5 à 7. Pour ma part, j'ai adoré; en plein l'ambiance festive que j'aime pour prendre un verre. La musique, surtout du rock des années 90, si ma mémoire est bonne, était excellente!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Terrible service on top of below average food. There were maybe three slices of avocado on the 'avocado toast' and the breakfast sandwich was the saddest thing you'll ever see. The restaurant was close to empty but you wouldn't have known with the lack of attention from the staff... Best part was when they blamed us when hair was found in one of the dishes! We had politely pointed it out and the obvious thing to do was just to replace it. Simple. Instead, they were rude, made ridiculous accusations, and ruined the mood for the rest of the meal. There are plenty of restaurants - skip rosewood, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Didn't get to eat in here. Was very busy place for brunch time and we were stuck waiting for about 10 minutes for someone to finally walk up to us and tell us the waiting time and availability. Looked like a good atmosphere but little space."}
{"text":"Brunch was soo delicious!! Everything is seasoned and cooked to perfection!! Quality mimosas as well, best in town!!"}
{"text":"Very good service, excellent oeufs frits bénédictine with a thick slice of medium-fat smoked meat, and hollandaise a la Yuzu (you can't really taste it, unfortunately). Mais à ma grande surprise : Finally a place where you don't have to pay an extra to get REAL maple syrup and extra Hollandaise sauce on the side. To me that makes a difference. Who wants that plastic syrup?! Lol My boyfriend had the fried chicken and pancakes (American fluffy pancakes) and thought it was very good, maybe not enough chicken and too many - wayyyy too many - pancakes? We counted like 8 pancakes for three little pieces of chicken, but overall we really liked our experience :) Will probably go back soon since they have an All You Can Drink Mimosas menu for $20! Yay!"}
{"text":"Bunch of us, Yelpers, had a wonderful class of pole dancing next door. We were super hungry; we arrived at Rosewood for brunch.

It's a beautiful two floors restaurant. The service was wonderful; our waitress always checked on us, by bringing water and making sure we were enjoying our food. 

Since we were from Yelp; there were complimentary dishes, like brioche with icing and topped with bacon and toasts with chicken pâté. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try them since I am a pescatarian. 

From the menu, I order poached egg, avocado and salmon toast with greens on the side. My food was delicious, except the salmon was slightly over cooked; the texture felt pasty. 

In the end, we received complimentary shots; that was good and fun. 

Great restaurant chosen by Mariko... thank you!"}
{"text":"What a fun surprise that was! Walked in to live music and got a seat right in front with some comfy couches and pillows. I was greeted by a nice young female waitress who brought us the menus right away.

I got the poutine Which was excellent huge chunky cold curds served with a special gravy that made normal poutines seem blaze. I got the Smokey old fashion which was out of this world. Check video :) 

I had a way better time here than Joverse as that
Place turns in to a real bell hole after 9 pm. They own both these locations and I had a way better time here as I had to leave Joverse because they didn't place our orders and it was over crowded. So if you're in the neighbourhood check out this place especially if there's live music going on."}
{"text":"If you want overpriced appetizers as your main entrees you've found the right place! Don't come hungry and you'll be satisfied. The manager and waitress asked us if everything was OK with our meals and we expressed our disappointment with the miniscule portions and they said they would sell us more food and suggested an appetizer. It's obvious that we could simply order more food and did not want to hear that as there answer. No customer service. Nice atmosphere and the food tasted decent but this was all a very big disappointment for $70. for 2 of us. We would have been better served at McDonalds on the same block because we would have at least left there full."}
{"text":"Rosewood was decent. Decor is very cool, location is great, but the food was quite simple. Yes, prices were equivalent, but when you order a salad, you expect more than 5% of toppings over romaine lettuce."}
{"text":"Great craft cocktails. The bartenders know what they are doing. Cozy atmosphere and the band is fantastic. I mean they made the night for us... and we are just getting started."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had brunch there on Sunday. The drinks were great! I had a Grey Goose pear screwdriver and the lemon ricotta pancakes with fresh lemon  infused maple syrup. Simply delicious!!"}
{"text":"On our first night we looked for a dining spot no further than across the street from our hotel, being very weary travelers.

Fun bar like setting, amazing service, we had a blast.

We had our first-and-only Pountine here....and an amazing bottle of wine, as well as glasses of Maple Whiskey.

GF and I split a salad and a shrimp appetizer to keep it on the light side.  Salad was wonderful, shrimp appetizer was just OK.

We were so surprised at the Pountine.  Made of wonderful real fries, and a homemade gravy, it was much better than I expected.  Cheese curds were a nice touch too.  It was very rich, and filling.  Now I can say I tried it!!

Great spot for a casual meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Serendipity...I'm one of those people that dislike reviews that talk about their day before they get to the stuff I care about, but I'll have to break my rule and describe the circumstance of the 5 stars for this review...

After a food coma nap from poutine at la banquise it was 9:15p on a Tuesday and we had just been turned away from the restaurant we had set our eye on for dinner due to them closing the kitchen early. Someone from the resto gave a rec for this place and our hotel being across the street it was a no brainer. So by luck, we found ourselves seated right in front of the stage on the first Tuesday of the month eating and enjoying some drinks on their \"jam night.\"

Food - we ordered a salmon tartare and steak sandwich to share. The salmon tartare was refreshing and came with an interesting combo of fried oranges (yes, make no mistake...oranges) and onions that was tasty and inventive. The steak sandwich was juicy, tender, and came with a side salad and crispy fries. Overall, I would rate the food 3.5 stars.

Drinks - Had a \"last word\" and the hubs ordered an old fashioned that came with a mason jar filled with smoke to add the smokiness to the drink. Would highly recommend the old fashioned as I drank rounds of that for the rest of the night. 4 stars for the drinks.

Ambience - Wow. This is what drove this place to 5 stars. Every first Tuesday of the month they have a jam night where musicians (many of them strangers to each other) come and jam together and the result is both amazing and magical. I am a fan of live music but the talent from the people that played on stage was mesmerizing to watch.  As my hubby and I promised to leave after every song we ended up staying till 1am due to FOMO on the great music that was to be had before us. Add this to a clean bathroom and the above said good food and great drinks...I was in bliss. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you, rosewood for making our last night in Montreal so memorable. Couldn't have asked for a better night!"}
{"text":"Umm so the ambiance is cool but the food is plain, for a second I thought about giving it 2 starts but that wood not be fair. Service was nice, music was good, young crowd."}
{"text":"A great place for a Sunday brunch. We had the chicken sandwich, the lemon ricotta pancakes, the steak and eggs and the tourtière. All great choices. The pancakes were beautifully fluffy with the nice tang of lemon. The steak was perfectly cooked and flavourful. The tourtière was interesting in that it was a little sweeter than you might find normally. And the chicken sandwich. Wow. All in all a great place with good service."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. In town 4 days, dinner here twice and I'm PICKY about my food and drinks. 
The cocktail menu's accessible-sounding drinks belie the deep complexity of these concoctions. I'd try anything with the booze of your choice. If Sam is your bartender, challenge him and you won't be disappointed - this is someone who takes pride in his craft and it shows. 
The food is stellar. The chicken nuggets (yeah, I know!) are top notch and come with the best ranch I've had and one I wish I could have always. (This from a ranch-hater!!) Both the \"cheesesteak\" and Chic Fillet are excellent, and the Thai popcorn has me trying to replicate the recipe at home. 

Very impressed with this newcomer -- from someone who usually reserves a first visit till after 6 months in operation. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service here is ALWAYS on point!!! From the management down to the staff. Very friendly and very efficient service. First time I went I went for their brunch. Bottomless mimosa for $20 and a brunch menu to die for! I had the classic breakfast, my girlfriend had their breakfast poutine which was awesome. Last night however out of the 5 times I went, I wasn't too pleased by my experience. First my beer was at an unpleasant temperature, somewhere between cold and room temperature! I tried the croquettes de poulet (Chicken nugget) and they were a little burnt and tough in the inside! I also ordered their \"Popcorn Shrimp\" to go, which is normally sooooo good! What I was told would take 2 minutes took 15 minutes and weirdly I sat there while my take out container sat on the ledge of the kitchen window however I was told they weren't ready. The manager Dan was awesome and compensated me with a free beer, which I didn't finish because it wasn't cold enough. By the time I got my order and went home (home is connected to their parking lot), the shrimp that JUST came out the fryer was ice cold! Could it have been because they were sitting their the whole time? I went back and had my order \"fixed\" right away. Which in other words was throwing the shrimp back into the fryer. This we know because the meat was over cooked and the same shrimp my girlfriend picked at was in the container. Not happy last night, hope that was a one off!"}
{"text":"Brunch review :

Trendy place with fun crowd, good music and cool atmosphere. Service is fine as well. 

Food is good, our plates where a little cold but generally the food was good. If you're here for the bottomless mimosas you better like orange juice. I would t recommend this option whatsoever. 

Happy to have tried it out once."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a colleague to come here for brunch. I was pretty disappointed with the food, it was only subpar and the service was not great either. The food was bland, i got the avocado toast and it was flavorless. My wife got the pork belly and it was over salted.  I asked for water and coffee refill and it took over 10 mins for someone to come back with it and the restaurant was pretty empty with only two other tables."}
{"text":"We went to Rosewood for Cocktail Invasion week and tried a few cocktails. The vibe was great and the staff were really friendly. We only had an appetizer but I will definitely be back to try the full menu. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The space itself + the ambiance gets 5 stars, but I can't give them more than 3 after having had their food.

We came here for bottomless brunch - the mimosas were fine, but the eggs Benedict was absolutely subpar. Instead of traditional hollandaise sauce, they use some clementine-infused sauce, which caused a zesty flavor and ruined the entire dish. Additionally, the smoked salmon in the dish was gross. Not fresh. 

Come here with friends for a drink or two [or three], but I'd opt out on the food."}
{"text":"The staff here were unprofessional and rude.  We had reservations for 11AM and were seated on time.  The restaurant was pretty empty.  We were a big group.  We didn't have to wait long for the food.  One of our friends found a strand of hair inside the salad and requested a new plate.  The kitchen staff returns with a new plate and accused us of putting our hair in food.  Spoke to the manager, who only apologized for his behavior.  

Overall, we had a bad experience here and the food wasn't all that great.  I had the steak and eggs, which were overly salted.  Needless to say we did not finish our food after being wrongly accused."}
{"text":"After researching the restaurant online and reading several articles for this brunch spot, we were really disappointed with the brunch and pre made mimosas that were so watered down, and we didn't even get a buzz off 5 drinks. Very limited items for brunch and sub par food. My friends whose bday it was had to send his breakfast as it arrived cold, under seasoned, and portions are small for the price you pay. Like a handful of mesculin  greens on the chicken burger was nothing special. Staff were nice, but the rest... nope."}
{"text":"loved this place last night.
Every employess there bends over backwards to make sure you served and happy."}
{"text":"Joverse owners have opened a spot next to Joverse that is similar to Joverse but open Mondays! So that's good. There are a bunch of TVs tuned to hockey and there's top 40 playing fairly loud. It's a little cold and downtown cookie cutter feeling somehow, maybe just the business men clients drinking around us turned us off. The staff was friendly and cool. The house drink I had with homemade grape soda was tasty but a little over sweet. I'm really thankful for these new options in old Montreal but would love to see the mark of a passionate focused owner pouring soul into the decor, beer list and every detail."}
{"text":"This is a tiny bar on the outskirts of Old Montreal not far from the basilica. We just stopped to grab some drinks. We did not eat here. The drink menu is pretty straight forward and they offer a good variety of beers. They have live music play on the weekends. There is also a little alley/patio that is a coo place to hang out. There is nothing horribly wrong or amazing about this place. I would stop and grab a drink here again if we were close."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nice and open with a well maintained bar and appropriately placed stage. Staff were all nice, plates were mostly well composed and balanced. Their basic egg/meat/toast dish was overpriced however I considered the other menu items to be a good value, particularly considering the location. Certainly planning on coming back for both brunch and a music night. It's very much a \"girls brunch date\" kind of place based on the crowd."}
{"text":"Amazing food...had brunch here, never had eggs that taste so delicious. The ambience was beautiful and the servers were friendly and happy! 
I wanted to go back there everyday for breakfast but it was the last day of my trip when my husband discovered this place. We r regular goers, surely will be regulars on our next visit!"}
{"text":"We came here on a friends recommendation as he knows the owner. The overall experience was ok, but we were not impressed with the service and the food quality. We had to consistently ask for our mimosas to be refilled, when the food arrived it was cold. Now that being said, the food tasted very good, but the fact that it was cold put a damper on things . Changes to menu are not an option, so for our gluten free friends it was a little difficult to find something to eat. There is Also no wifi available to restaurant patrons . Overall a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch! 25$ bottomless mimosas and the menu items where decently sized and yummy. Photo is from the salmon avocado plate. Cozy and comfortable seating with friends. Not crowded so worth passing by!"}
{"text":"The staff were so friendly and helpful however the poutine was a bit salty for my taste. Be aware that this place is not vegetarian friendly. Besides a side salad and fries there are no vegetarian options besides dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome, creative cocktails and both bartenders I interacted with were absolutley top notch. Bravo to Rosewood, we visited many bars in the area and they are certainly one of, if not thee top one."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem--such good vibes and the owner Marcel is a really great host! They have live bands that come play and we were here on a Saturday night, and the group that played were amazing! We got the soon to be called 'tough girl' sangria and old fashioned which were really great drinks both in terms of presentation and taste. The food was alright, but the salmon tartar specifically had too much mayo in it. Otherwise the interior is really nice and clean, and theyve done a great job with the space they have for the terrasse. Totally recommend it for a chill night with great drinks and music!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on a Sunday afternoon with two friends. The place and the ambiance are okay, music was fine but a little loud making it a little hard to communicate. Their brunch menu is simple with 5-6 choices. 
The service was not good; my friends had to ask twice for their coffee and it came 15 minutes later, as for the food, it came after 50 minutes (not exaggerating a bit). I ordered the steak and eggs, which says on the menu that it included 2 fried eggs, however it came only with one (and after 50 minutes!!). The food overall was alright, nothing special. I also want to mention that tables around us were also waited for their order to arrive a long time. Unsurprisingly, we also had to wait to wait 10 minutes to pay for our bills. Only positive thing is that they gave us a small discount on our bills to apologize for the terrible service.
I don't recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Montreal.  Service  was impeccable.  Food superb.  Jeremy and Michael are
the friendliest and best people I have met in this town.  Which says a lot considering everyone in Montreal are super friendly.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars...

I am absolutely apalled by how awful the food was and how much we were ripped off. I went to the battle chefs event and each person had to pay around 57 bucks to get a full meal and watch the event. I assumed that the price was so stiff because we were getting a quality dinner including a drink, app, main and dessert. I was clearly dumb to assume that because there were only 3 app choices and 3 main choices (2 of which were fish, 1 veal... weird). No dessert, no drink, nothing. And tip wasn't included. 

Anyway, I ordered the veggie spring rolls, which ended up being frozen in the centre. Clearly store bought. I sent them back and they returned frozen YET AGAIN. Clearly, whoever runs the place has no pride and will charge exorbitant fees for mass produced, frozen food. For my main, I ordered the veal with kalamata olive mashed potato... worst combination and simply inedible. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed and won't ever go back again. You can't try to fool customers like that."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this bar! Walked in and felt at home - two straight times in a row......that's not something that happens unless it is truly a spot that not only the owners (Jonas is a rockstar) but the staff (Tanya is AMAZING) is excited about!  It felt like home....period!"}
{"text":"First time in montreal and stopped here for a casual dinner.  Drinks were awesome.  Food was very good. However. ...service.... this is why they got 5 stars.  Impeccable! !  Our server helped us read the thru the menu as we don't speak French.  She made wonderful recommendations. She even treated us to dessert when she found out we were celebrating our anniversary.  She made our day.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend desperately wanted to watch some kind of basketball game while we were on vacation (ugh), and this was the sports bar closest to where we were staying. Crowd was certainly bumping on a Thursday night, and I'm sure the $5 mojito special helped with that. It certainly helped me get through that basketball game at least...

On the food side, we ordered the poutine to share. It wasn't the best I'd ever had, but decent enough. Mojitos were great, if a bit on the weak side. 

The service was really friendly - this was a theme throughout our time in Montreal - and the poor server spent upwards of 20 minutes trying to find the channel that was broadcasting the game, never once making us feel like we were being a bother even though we definitely were. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but it seems like a decent place to get the night started or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Good spot for casual brunch, dinner & music show. I've been here for the latter a few months back, the food was good but I would say that the portion was a bit on the small side.
We came back here recently for brunch with some Yelpers after an event and were seated upstairs. The staff is friendly and attentive. We were offered some snack while waiting for our food (bacon bits cinnamon rolls & chicken liver pâté) and it was quite good. The menu is short & sweet, nothing fancy but like I mentioned, it's casual. We got steak & eggs, egg benedict, avocado toasts and salmon toasts, etc and were offered a shot of Galliano & espresso which was yummy as well.

It's a nice place to hang out w your friends.
I would come back for an easy-going sunday brunch :)"}
{"text":"The place looks very trendy, hipsterish, and has great lighting and cool architecture. Sadly, food doesn't follow the ambiance there. 

First of all, Rose & Goji berries lemonade was too sweet. I had a medium (way too small) Japanese Ceasar salad (Yuzu dressing) with tuna. Only five pieces of seared tuna. Not even fresh. It looks like it just came out of the fridge. Classic burger was small but ok. The only positive thing with this recent dining experience was the poutine gravy and the service. Staff was friendly. 

Overall portions are very small and food is SO expensive. Def overpriced. 

Considering the fact they just opened 3 months ago, I'm sure they can do better. I would recommend people to wait a while before trying that place but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is to die for. One of the best restaurants I have ever been to.

I will start with the poutine which is the reason that we came here. This poutine is super fancy and elevated. I loved the veal gravy! The portion was very generous.

My husband and the husband and another couple that we were with got this delicious-looking burger. They both devoured it and loved it. Portions were huge and the chef was super attentive to how  my husband like his Burger. All of the food here tastes like the chef has studied the food and worked his best to find the exact ingredients to perfect it.

For my entree I got homemade chicken nuggets. They were delicious. Fries were well-cooked the perfect amount of crispy and potatoey. Chicken nuggets were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and tasted like real chicken. I love the sauce they have to dip it into I think it's like a spicy BBQ sauce definitely homemade. They also have a ranch that's out of this world. My only recommendation was that I would have ordered the salad it would have paired better with the chicken nuggets.

I can't really comment on the drinks because I didn't drink alcohol there but I know that the rest of the people in my party really enjoyed their drinks and my soda came out really fast. 

What really sealed the deal on me for this restaurant was there wait staff. We came very late when they were obviously already cleaning up in the kitchen and they seem to have reopened the kitchen just for us. It meant so much because we were only in Montreal for one night! And our waiter was the perfect combination of respectful of our space and conversation and attentive to what we needed as far as sides drinks Etc.

This restaurant is so good that I would consider going to it twice over trying a new restaurant next time I come to Montreal. Bravo."}
{"text":"I came here with my girl friends on Wednesday night during MTL à Table. They were hosting a cocktail competition where we got to try two different cocktails for $12. Honestly I didn't like either of them. One was a gin cocktail but it tasted like Chinese medicine. The other was something similar to cranberry vodka. Nothing special. I also ordered a bloody Caesar that was better.
 
For starters I had the crispy pork belly with cucumber, radish and shimiji mushrooms. It had a hoisin vinaigrette, chili caramel, micro coriander. This was $4 extra. It was just ok. I feel like i could get much better pork belly in Chinatown or elsewhere. Next I had the filet beef with Provençal butter, red wine sauce and roasted and steamed vegetables. This was also $4 extra. I felt like it was a bit dry. Lastly for dessert I had the brownie served warm with homemade vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. The brownie was hard and cost $3 extra. 

Yes the MTL a table menu was $21 but everything I wanted to order cost more and it wasn't worth it. The food was really not memorable. I've definitely had better pork belly, beef and brownie elsewhere. I did not enjoy the cocktails.  I will not be back and I'm sorry to say that I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Terrible service and just eh, ok food. No wonder it was pretty much empty on a Sunday morning for brunch. 

I had the breakfast sandwich, which was disappointing. Way too much bread with measly fillings... one-egg omelet, 1 thin sausage split in half with cheese and standard toppings. It tasted fine, but nothing to write home about. A few of my friends had the salmon avocado toast and were also highly disappointed (ummmm... did you forget the avocado???)

The service was slow. Granted, we were a big party, but also the restaurant was empty and there a manager and a waiter were both around. Rather than check on us to see we had our coffees and waters topped up and that everything was ok with the food, they thought it best to hang out by the kitchen and chat. Needless to say, we had to flag them down a few times.

On top of that, we had a very unfortunate incident with the food and a member of the kitchen staff. He's obviously not fit for this industry if his ego is sorely bruised when someone sends back a dish for an unsanitary strand of hair in the meal. To accuse the customer of being the one to blame for it is beyond rude and unprofessional. Gordon Ramsey, you have your next kitchen nightmare.

There is amazing food and service in Montreal. This place isn't it. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tragically, I haven't brunched in a while. With a friend coming to town and a Sunday morning free, I knew what had to be done and made a reservation for the first place I could find that had bottomless mimosas. 

The food was fine, the service was good. Candace was disappointed that they replaced the salmon lox bagel with avocado toast, but did enjoy said toast. It didn't blow me away, but they had mimosas, so I'm happy."}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted to get poutine before we left. We stumbled upon this place while we were strolling in Old Montreal. 

I cannot describe in words how delicious this poutine was - you must try it! The cheese, hash browns, sauce, bacon, to the egg paired together perfectly. The food was fresh and mouth-watering! We both enjoyed this dish a lot, we would come back if we visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge fan of leaving negative comments through Yelp, but the experience at Rosewood left me speechless. First and foremost, the food was okay and presentation was pretty nice. It's a little pricey for what you get. However, we decided to come here because of other Yelp reviews....

My friends and I took our girlfriend out for a nice bridal bunch. Everything was okay until my friend found a strand of hair embedded in her food. I don't blame her since I wouldn't want to eat food with hair in it. She kindly told the waiter about it and he willingly agreed to bring back a new plate. After the waiter took the plate away, another staff member (I assume part of the kitchen staff) returned and accused her of putting it there herself.  I couldn't believe the manner in which this staff member acted. We were humiliated and felt so sad that our friend's bridal brunch was completely ruined. She ended up not even touching the food (we still paid for it, which was fine with us). 

Overall, I couldn't believe that this happened and I highly recommend not coming here. There are plenty of other places that will treat their customers this way."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on Sunday with a group of friends. Though I called on Thursday to make a reservation, they didn't have it in their computer. However, they were super accommodating and still seated us.

We got bottomless mimosas which were filled with generous ratios right at the table.  One of my friends had to go study after, so she only got one mimosa, which was $9, so it's definitely worth it to just get $25 bottomless.

I ordered one of the daily specials, house-smoked salmon on multigrain bread with poached eggs, avocado and a bunch of other stuff. The avocados were a bit darkened, which I don't mind because I hate food waste, but avoid getting that if you're nitpicky about that type of stuff. Otherwise, the dish was absolutely divine.

My friends who ordered the chicken and pancakes had to order extra syrup because there was not nearly enough.  The servers were a bit forgetful when we asked for extra syrup, but I can't really blame them because they were super busy refilling everyone's glasses while juggling their regular duties! I also wouldn't say it was understaffed because it definitely would have been too crowded with another server.

Since it was my friend's birthday, we also got a complimentary dessert with a sparkler on top!

Overall it was a great experience, and with the cheapest bottomless mimosas in town, I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Hummmm tough call. I really wish I could give a 2,5 star. I can't so I've decided to give 2 stars and here's why: first the place is kinda blah. I didn't feel it had any personality or charm or interest. They have TV everywhere which bothers me. If it's not a sports bar why having TV? Also they play all kind of random music; I don't think it's to please any kind of crowd but more By lack of personality again. I mean pick a style, choose a personality and assume. Besides that the other positive thing (!) is the service. It's not the best service ever but it's friendly and nice enough. Now. The food. Well, in my opinion It's not good. They have a bar type of menu. I have nothing against that. We shared the kefta skewers and the popcorn shrimps as staters. The kefta were tasteless but thank to the tzatziki it was ok. The popcorn shrimp a were huge and good enough. For the main course I took the classic burger and the poutine. The beef patty was super hard and over cooked, that's what I can say about that burger. The poutine was very tasteless. Too bad because the fries by themselves were good and so the cheese. But the sauce was in need of salt, pepper and just taste really. So yeah, I wouldn't go back. Maybe for a drink but really if I have"}
