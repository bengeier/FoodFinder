{"text":"Amazing, quaint Fish and chips place in the heart of the city. The service is incredibly friendly, and the food is prepared carefully and served within a couple of minutes. Prices are great for the quantity and quality of food, we always leave with a full belly. Be sure to ask for the spicy mayo, a must for fries. Most noticeable is the way the fish comes out incredibly clean, not greasy at all. While the restaurant itself is small and steadily busy, it's still a relaxing place to eat. I've been to a lot of fish places and this is definitely worth a try...or three!"}
{"text":"After walking around Queen West, I stumbled upon this place. Had the Haddock and Chips. Very very good for a fast good joint!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place after hearing about it for months from my co-workers. Really excellent! Large portions, fresh, and not at all greasy. When we arrived at noon, we were the only customers, but after a few minutes there was a long lineup. The service was fast and friendly. They also have a good selection of gourmet pop."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for lunch. The service is great and fast.  I always love the seating that faces out to the street, nice to watch the world go by as you munch away on some tasty fish. I have had a few different things here, shrimp and chips, salmon sandwich. Always fresh tasting. Love the crunch coating on the salmon, it must be corn meal or something. It makes the sandwich really crunchy and flavourful. Batttered or coated, neither are overwhelming or too much. The fish always shines through. The shop doesn't have that stinky fried fish smell so they must be diligent about changing the oil in the fryer. I don't eat the tartar sauce but apparently my partner-in-lunch-times claims that it is really good.  Always a great place to grab some delish fish."}
{"text":"I kept walking by this place but finally decided to try it because banh mi boys was too crowded.  The wife and I had high hopes because we were looking for a nice fish and chip place to go to. We asked for recommendations since they did not have the fish I normal order, which is Halibut. Cod was recommended so we ordered two with a ginger ale. The fish seems a little flaky and undercooked and the batter was not to my liking - it had a weird taste. I liked the fries but missing that coleslaw. The vinegar spray bottles seemed like a nifty idea but got old real quick after using it once. It got a little messy and the bottles were sticky."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have been here a few times and have been very happy with each visit. I've had the english style cod fish and chips, grilled salmon and salad, and a salmon wrap. The fish is very fresh and the portions are very generous. The fries I had with the fish and chips were crispy and just about perfectly done. The english style fish was not greasy and not too much batter, which I appreciate. All of the sauces seem to be house made and tasty.  The owner is super nice and friendly and the place is clean. I definitely recommend The Big Fish for anybody who is looking for some fish in the neighborhood. Not to mention the fish is sustainable, which is a huge bonus."}
{"text":"So i had the Codzilla w. chips. $10.95. I'm not sure how much bigger the normal cod w. chips is, but it's $2 cheaper. Nevertheless, always like it when i can see the piece of fish dipped in the batter then fried. Reminds me of my time in Oz on the coast. Only thing that would make it better is if the fish was on ice and I could choose it or see it on display like a fish market. But it's in a bucket in the fridge; sanitary enough.  i'd say the batter is pretty good, fried fairly decently to get a nice crispiness on the outside yet flaky fish on the inside. I like it. The chips, they were ok. I think it could improve just a bit but it's decent.  also had the fish taco, $4.95. Pretty decent sized fish in it, not sure what type though. the fish stretched from end to end on the taco then some 'slaw overtop. I think it could use a bit more flavor, maybe some sauce in addition to the 'slaw. Otherwise, it's a fair taco.  The guy who works there quite friendly, coming to clean the tables right after people left. Pretty casual place, never looks very busy unfortunately, not many tables inside. Hope it get's more business during the wk.  i prefer the tables facing the windows so i can people watch"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. I had the special of the day fish and rice. Other people in the group had fish sandwich. Both were made to order and were delicious. The wait was minimal even though it was made fresh. They have non sea food items as well such as burgers. Gotta try the fish tacos next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked by and decided to try it out to go.  We ordered the fish (haddock) and chips as well as a side of clam chowder.  The service was friendly and courteous.  The food is made to order so you'll need to be patient.  When we asked how the clam chowder was, the guy took the time to explain that it wasn't the starchy potato-based kind so we decided to try it.  I was impressed because it tasted exactly how he described it!  The clams in the chowder were tiny though but it was still good!  Yum!  We really liked the fish too; it wasn't greasy and the batter wasn't too thick.  The guy carefully timed the cooking ensuring the fish was cooked perfectly!  The fries were just OK though.  They were a bit dark and a little soggy.  Perhaps they were refried?  Not sure.  Anyway, we will definitely go back for the fish and clam chowder!"}
{"text":"After we went for a walk along Queen Street and stopped for a bite to eat at a little fish place called The Big Fish. Straddling a corner which was previously a submarine place the place is long and narrow. There are a few window seats at the front looking onto both Queen Street and Cameron Street and a small outdoor patio (it was too cool to sit outside) so we opted for one of the window seats. It is tiled in subway tiles giving that traditional fish and chips place feel and features a vintage inspired palette. The owner hangs out behind a long counter/bar that contains the kitchen, serving area and an extensive overheard menu. There was a fine selection of fish sandwiches of different kinds of fish, available either grilled or fried and traditional fish and chips and an interesting selection of sides. The place is upscale in that Queen Street hipster way and is a much needed addition to the area. We opted for some veggie samosas, some fried clams, a grilled fish sandwich and the grilled basa. The service is friendly and the servings as expected were handsome, it is after all The Big Fish, and delicious. I hope the place attracts a much deserved crowd."}
