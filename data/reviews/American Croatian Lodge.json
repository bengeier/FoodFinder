{"text":"Had our 25th High School Reunion there.  It is quite a massive and impressive place.  Very clean and well lit.  Food was very homestyle and quite tasty.  Definitely not world class cuisine, but tasty, hot, and plentiful. Overall I found the experience quite satisfying."}
{"text":"Affectionately reffered to as \"The Cro Dome\" by all of Eastlake / Lake county.   I've been to many events here. All weddings. Almost had mine here but my mom said the pastries weren't Italian enough or something.   This place is huge. Probably so that when the Croatian folk have weddings they can fit the entire community. I'm pretty sure it can hold 800-something.   I like the food. Some people don't. It's definitely not good for vegetarians like others have mentioned. It's typical Eastern European fare.   If you'd like to try their food you can go to the attached restaurant - Dubrovnik Gardens. You'll have a much better (and non mass produced) type of meal there."}
{"text":"I can not begin to tell you how pleased I was with the American Croatian Club. The event coordinator, Melita did a wonderful job working with on all of the wedding details. Melita was very flexible with our vendors and allowed us to set up the west hall the night before our reception. The American Croatian Hall food was absolutely amazing and we received wonderful comments from our guests on the quality of the food. Melita helped us take care of every detail and allowed us to set up the room anyway we wanted. They even allowed us to have a cigar bar and a sparkler send-off at the end of the night! The bartender, Andre was a rock star, remembering our guests drinks and had them ready when they came to the bar - what a memory! The American Croatian Lodge helped us bring our dreams of an elegant wedding alive. I highly recommend having your wedding here."}
{"text":"I've attended many events, throughout the years at the American-Croatian Lodge (ACL), and usually had a good experience, despite the semi-rude staff. This week, I attended a rather large fundraiser at the ACL, where one had to buy a ticket to have the privilege to enter the various drawings for the fundraiser.   I was sitting among 4 tables of family and friends, with 3 people who have a gluten allergy, when dinner was served. The Lodge was notified weeks ahead of time, and confirmed they had a special gluten free meal.   Sad to say, dinner came with salad dressed with gluten dressing, and when asked about salad for the gluten free people, a server, looking confused, said she'd be back with something, then disappeared into the abyss, never to be seen again.   The main course came, and the server who delivered it was asked about the gluten-free entrees. Rather abruptly, she stated they were aware of the 3 people who needed gluten-free meals and they would be up in a few minutes. Everyone started eating, but no gluten-free meals arrived.  When a third server came to clear the dinner plates away and deliver strudel to the table, she was also asked about the gluten-free meals. She said they were coming right up and left to see where they were. Ten minutes later she came out with three plates with a grilled chicken breast on them. No salad, vegetables, or potatoes; just the grilled chicken breast. When asked about salad or vegetables, she stated, \"This is it. This is the gluten free meal\", as she turned and left. Graciously, the 3 attendees ate what they got, and tried to enjoy the evening.   After dinner, 6 of us were sitting there arranging our tickets and talking, while we waited for the cash drawings and baskets. I looked up and noticed one of the servers clearing an unattended table near to us, grab the 5 strips of tickets (100 tickets) that were there and put them on top of her bus cart, in an attempt to steal them! Our table was aghast! I ran after the server and confronted her. She was a slender lady, around 5'6\", in her mid-60's to early 70's, with short gray hair and a thick Croatian accent.    When I caught up with her, I asked her why she took those tickets, and at first she acted like she didn't understand me. So I pointed at the tickets and asked her again, why she was taking these tickets for a drawing that hadn't happened yet, which she said, \"Someone told me to throw away.\" I shook my finger and said I'd be taking the tickets, and removed them from the bus cart.   I put them on our table, and went to talk to someone across the hall, when I noticed the \"Thieving Server\" at my table trying to pick up the tickets again. One of my table mates put their hand on the tickets as I was approaching, and I asked what was going on. My table mates told me she said they were her tickets, that she paid money for them, and that she was taking them back. I looked at the woman and said, \"What?\", and she responded, \"They mine, I pay for them\". I called her a liar and told her I watched her take them from a table and reiterated, she had already told me someone told her to throw them out; she turned around and walked away. Talk about a \"WoW\" moment! When the rightful owners returned, they were astonished a server tried to steal their tickets!  Also, during the basket raffles, when one of the tickets was called, one of the male bar workers ran up with a winning ticket! WTH???!   Does one have to point out how unethical it is for an employee of a venue to participate in fundraising activities that patrons have paid good money for that privilege?   To say, I am disappointed in ACL, is an understatement, at this point. I don't think I could recommend them for another event and will submit my suggestion to the committee, for a different venue for next year's fundraiser."}
{"text":"We have been to many weddings and other events at the Croatian Lodge.  The food is somewhat representative of the food of the non-litoral part of Croatia.  There is also a small gift shop called Mandica's, which offers a small selection of authentic Croatian made items including some good Croatian chocolates.  And the museum, which is open Friday evenings, is well worth a visit.  The museum has ever changing exhbits and a great Christmas exhibit.  The property has a soccer field, and if you are lucky may see a game in action. There is a Bocce Ball court.  And if you like Croatian sausages, cheese and such to take home a stop at Miro's Meat Market located on the property in an adjacent building.     In short the price for an event is a bargain and the food is good."}
{"text":"I attended the Slovenian Mens Club Dinner Dance here and cannot say enough nice things about the party center!  The food was amazing. Like, write home to mama amazing. While I settled for just texting mom, I can tell you that my friends were still gushing over the food the next day. Roast Beef, sausage, Vienerschnitzel, mashed potatoes, vegetable medley, wedding soup, salad, pastries... everything was top notch. Nothing over-salted, but still perfectly seasoned.  The servers brought out courses at well-timed intervals and were great about clearing our table. Coffee was served hot. The service was excellent, everyone was so friendly. We kept the bar very busy, but they were on point.  All of this is not to mention how beautiful the facility was. This event had about 575 guests and it didn't feel crowded at all.  I would highly recommend this for your event or wedding!"}
{"text":"I have nothing against the Croatian people. It's just that your food sucks. Well, for vegetarians anyway. The schnitzel and sausages looked pretty appetizing. But like some other reviewers have stated, the veg option does not equal pasta. And what tremendously awful pasta it was! Plain old long noodles swimming in sauce so acidic my mouth turned into one giant canker sore. What no parm cheese either? Thanks. The bread was good, as well as the water. Ain't no damn way i would pay for drinks there! I've gone for a few parties and a wedding and alwaysend up with the same food. Is that all they make or do the people who invite me to these disasters pay for the cheapest food? It's also near Lake Erie, but you can't see it. It's across the street and behind houses. One IS treated to cool Croatian ephemera throughout the place. They're nice to look at on the way to the bathroom. So if you like schnitzel and watching depressed vegetarians pick at their food, this is your place. Otherwise, snag a veggie burger at BK before you roll in there."}
