{"text":"Really slow service even though we were one of only two tables in the restaurant. But, the food is consistently good. I will just stick to carry out. Order from here regularly and am really glad there is good Indian food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's a sincere if mediocre Indian buffet. I always fret that they don't have enough business, and imagine that a faster turnover would push this up a notch. The folks are sweet. If you are in the area, its a good choice for an easy lunch. Can't tell you about dinner."}
{"text":"As usual , no hi or a welcome smile...They have ne of the worst customer service I have ever seen. I walk in within 15min before the end of the lunch special and they refuse to allow me to take out from the buffee...so a customer walk in to buy and they don't care!!!"}
{"text":"simply best food in cleveland. I always love to go to this place with my friends and family great customer care"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Always great food and excellent service. 5 stars if you enjoy Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Signed up for a yelp account just to review this place.

Okay, only been a handful of times but then again I've only been in Cleveland for a few months. This place is hands down the best in _Cleveland_. I underscore Cleveland, because there are some posts from people likely comparing it to other Indian places in the country.

Is this place the BEST in the world? No. But in the short time I have been here I feel safe in saying that you take what you can get in Cleveland. Tried 4 other places here and this one is the clear winner. 

I'm not rating based on service, ambiance, or whatnot. When I go to an Indian place I have low expectations for the \"dining experience\" - as should you. Indian places are NOTORIOUS for the lack of the aforementioned niceties. If you're looking for a 5-star dining experience go to some place where you will PAY 5-stars (ie. not an Indian place). When I go to an Indian place I go for the food. 

So, as for the food I've tried the lunch buffets mostly. Good selection. Recall chicken biryani, tikka masala, tandoor chicken, 2 other types of rice, saag paneer, channa masala, some veggie samosas, various lentil-based soups, chutney/other dips, and various desserts. This was for $11. The buffet changes slightly from time to time as well. Okay, so feel free to label me as a stereotypical American, but I base most of my Indian food critiques on the chicken tikka masala/butter chicken - it seems to be the easiest to judge across different restaurants. This place's CTM is very moist chicken breast in a creamy tomato/yogurt sauce of a good consistency - very mildly spiced. Their naan is not the greatest tasting, but it is hot and fresh. They do give you dosa if requested. The saag paneer and channa masala are very tasty.

If this place weren't 30 minutes away from me I would be there at least every other day. That is all."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure if I was eating the same food as everyone else leaving reviews? Or maybe they haven't had good Indian food? Heck it wouldn't even of been good on non-ethnic levels. The food was all equal amounts of disgusting and/or bland. The chicken tikki masala was extremely dry and had a sour taste to it, I hope it won't make me sick later.  I honestly don't have anything nice to say other than the staff was friendly, and the place looked clean.
So I'm sorry to say, but I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Had the rava masala dosa. It is semolina flour with fermented rice fried to a crispy crepe with onions and green chillis embedded. It is rather staple in southern India. The crepe is filled with curried mashed potatoes which are quite flavorful. It comes with flavored dal and coconut chutney. 

The samosas were freshly fried and not heated up. Excellent choice for a light bite.

Service can be a little slow and inattentive. But who cares. The place seemed clean. Will be back to test their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I have never liked their décor and have always doubted their hygiene and cleanliness. It is just the food that keeps me going back but after my visit yesterday I am going to have to re-think if I would want to eat there again. We ordered dosa, aloo tikki chaat, paneer curry dish and naan. In a few mins the server came back saying their aloo tikki chaat is not good (whatever that means!) and asked us to order something else. We then ordered the samosa chaat. People who came in after us were being served but there was no sign of our food.. Not even the samosa chaat which is supposed to be an appetizer. After we flagged the server down he said it will take a few mins. After a few mins he brought the paneer curry and naan and said the samosa chaat was not ready yet. The paneer curry and naan were great tasting but that was the only highpoint of our meal. He then brought the dosa with sambar and chutney. Dosa was just okay. Sambar was not great either. Chutney had more of a Thai flavor to it than Indian. He then asked us if we still wanted the samosa chaat. When we said yes, he brought just the samosas and chutney saying chaat will take time so just have samosas. We asked him to bring the chaat out when it was ready. He asked us to have the samosas for now and that he would bring the chaat once it was ready. He then got the chaat (without any samosas in it). When asked he said I brought the samosas earlier and chaat now. Totally made me forget that I am at a restaurant and not in my own kitchen. He did not even once offer to compensate for the delay in bringing the appetizer out. Chaat was not good either. We had a few spoons of it and sent it back. We then had to ask him to get the samosa chaat off our check. I do not think we deserved to pay for it after all the delays and the bad service. And even after all this they had the nerve to add aloo tikki chaat on our check! The entire dinner experience was more annoying than relaxing. I left the restaurant with a really bad taste both in my mouth and my mind."}
{"text":"Our family just loves this place.  The owners are wonderful and treat us special every visit.  The food is great and very authentic.  Love the Naan bread and my favorite dish is the lamb Vindaloo and my wife loves the mugli chicken.  They have soup called samber which is outrageous.  Personally we think it's the best Indian in Cleveland.   Love it!?"}
{"text":"Amazing South Indian food. We had idli, paper masala dosa and rava masala dosa. Great chatni and sambar!"}
{"text":"I had the worst stomach pain ever after eating dinner over here. I am writing this review 2 days after eating dinner and i m still dehydrated. I don't know whether it was the appetizers or the lamb curry that made me sick"}
{"text":"Dried old rice, not a good place to dine out if you are looking for serious Indian food. I wouldn't give 1 star if don't have too..."}
{"text":"My husband and I go for the lunch buffet occasionally.   The food is delicious!   I am not savvy when it comes to Indian cuisine,  however,  and this place doesn't really help you learn what you are eating.   I dont know what most things are on the buffet. That being said, I am pretty adventurous and the buffet set up allows you to try a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  They serve goat which has a lot of bones etc. In it.  The meat tastes great, but not a fan of all the bones.

The service is not stellar,  but adequate, and the decor is cheap and old."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, great menu, friendly attentive service, and they have Kingfisher. What more can you ask for?

Get the lamb naan."}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab some dinner on Saturday 11/21 and received nothing but amazing service and high quality food. 

The Vegetable Samosas were perfect. The chicken Tikka Massalla was perfect. The Mango Lassi was even better! Amazing. 

Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. I brought a friend who had never had Indian food before and they made a believer of her. Best samosas I've had."}
{"text":"We do not eat at this place anymore. They fry everything and sautéed everything in the same used oil, dose not matter if you are vegetarian or not. Last time we were there a year ago, asked if they fry vegetable samosa and paneer and sautée vegetables in the same oil that they fried meat or chicken. First the waiter says, its separate oil. I could not trust his expression when he said that. I clarified that out of 5 people on table, all vegetarian, one has meat allergy. He right away said, let's not order samosas and paneer dishes!!! He said dosa will be only thing that will be ok. We ate there, $80 down, I did not feel that they cared about customer 's preference of food. 
So if you are vegetarian and not want to eat any meat contaminated food, this is not your place."}
{"text":"We eat at Taj almost once a week now. My roommate loves their grill items, which they always serve fresh, and I stick to their curry items. 

Taj is slightly expensive but will never break the bank if you're really craving Indian food. Owner seems a bit terse but has great customer service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and I can only say that the food is inconsistent. I've had fantastic tikka masala, and a korma that was so over-salted it was almost inedible (if I'd eaten in I'd certainly have returned it, but that's a luxury with take-out).

I love Indian, but this doesn't have the complexity or subtle spice layers that I expect from really good Indian food."}
{"text":"In terms of taste, the food was good and I am willing to go even it is over priced. Unfortunately the service is the worst in comparison to any other place. I would never visit this place as our server seemed
drunk and was extremely rude. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Another day and yet another review by me of another Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area... hmmm seems like I see a trend in my eating choices...  : )
We have not tried the buffet yet, but have been there for dinner several times.  The food is very good but it took a bit of convincing for the server lady to believe that we wanted American Hot spice.  Finally she agreed and we loved it.  
The service is a bit off.  Not much personality.  Also the restaurant seems pretty empty most times, which is a shame because the food is really good."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Always a pleasant experience. The co owner who also waits tables is very good - we often get freebies if the food takes long to arrive. Unheard of at other Indian restaurants.
The food is fresh. Tastes good all the time.  I have had their south Indian dishes as well as curries. 
Buffet - pretty much same selection all the time.  He should change it up to keep them fresh and interesting. 
Decor can use some big improvements. Little more lighting, fresh paint and some new wall art."}
{"text":"Short take:  It scratched our itch for Indian food; would we go back if we lived here?  Probably not; it was such a slog to make our way out to Richmond Hills, so unless we lived there, we'd probably try to find a closer restaurant.  Maybe dinner off the menu is better....we're leaving Cleveland soon, so I won't have an opportunity to try it.

Standouts:  Chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala. Also very good were uttapams and dal fry.

Baseline:  We've eaten Northern and Southern Indian food made by South Asian expats and Pakistanis in South East Asia, but never in India.  We lived in the Middle East where Pakistanis and South Asians make up the large class of business managers and whose food and Lebanese food are ubiquitous.  We now live in Franklin, TN and still can't believe that we eat such fabulous Indian food.  At least twice a week we eat at the astoundingly excellent Swagruha where Siva and VJ knock it out of the park every day with their tasty offerings and meticulous and consistent execution, whether that's the lunch buffet or the dinner menu. We learned that the family that runs Taj India Palace is from Bangladesh, so that probably accounts for some differences in style and intensity, but I can't say I've ever intentionally had Bangladeshi food--now, my curiosity is piqued; I can't wait to try some and now I've distracted myself.

We threaded our way out to Taj India Palace after reading glowing reports of their buffet.  We arrived a little late--2:30pm on Mother's Day, when the buffet closes at 3pm, so we didn't go at peak buffet time. The shopping center it's in looks abandoned and forlorn, but we're used to finding great food in just such places: in the cheap seats.  For us, \"ethnic\" food in fringe neighborhoods is almost a guarantee of good, if not great, food to come.  \"Ethnic\" food in high rent districts? Meh, not so much.

We were expecting a crazy Mother's Day crowd.  There wasn't one. We expected more patrons than we saw; there weren't many.  We did see South Asians, so we were pleased with that, but not so many; maybe 5-6 tables?  The buffet looked like it had seen some action, so I guessed that the volume might have been a little higher earlier.

The buffet featured Indian thalis--stainless steel trays with compartments and some Northern Indian and some Southern Indian standards, chicken tikka, goat curry, chicken tikka masala, dal fry (yellow lentils with garlic and cumin), chana masala (garbanzo beans with red gravy), bindhi (okra), fish curry, idlis, gulab jamun (little donut balls of epic-ness said my 12 year old), ginger chicken and a few more vegetarian selections that I can't recall.  We weren't offered dosas and were really looking forward to that. I didn't see anyone else getting dosas either.

The uttapam (rice flour bread) on the buffet were tiny little rounds like pancakes, with scallions and peas--tasty with a pleasing slight chewiness.  The nan was nicely puffy, but tasted like they were raised too quickly. They tasted vaguely of raw flour and were overly yeasty, but they did have a nice texture--puffy and chewy; good for mopping up dal fry.

The chicken tikka was excellent and a stand out; as was the chicken tikka masala.  The chicken tikka was tender and juicy with a decent amount of heat for a buffet selection. My 6 year old ate maybe 7 pieces of chicken after I peeled the spicy layers off. 

We had some masala chai; I liked that it was delivered in a small stainless steel tea pitcher, so I could have more than one cup of it, but it was disappointingly bland, even after I sweetened it with table sugar. I love my masala chai strong and bracing, with sweetened condensed milk. I learned to drink it that way at a Pakastani-run Indian restaurant in Vientiane, Laos, called Nazim's where they made it from scratch by muddling a cardamom pod and a whole clove and then steeping that in Indian black tea poured on top of about an inch of sweetened condensed milk.  Great food, but an absolute dive. The best black pepper chicken pepper fry I've ever had, but now, I'm just waxing nostalgic."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit here at least several times a month for the buffet...we were here on Saturday February 3, 2018, and again enjoyed every bit of our food. The taste and spice level are always consistent....the spice level is generally in the mild range, with some entrees occasionally medium, but still not too hot.  The dosa's are always a nice addition with the meal.  We are vegetarian, and the majority of the entrees on the buffet are plant based....there is also a selection of chicken and goat for those wanting meat....we generally come on Saturdays or Sundays, and the entrees are never completely the same; at least several are different.  The same goes for weekdays, which we have visited more than a few times....Some of the mainstays are Dal, chickpeas, pakoras, veggie pancakes, basmatti rice ( although there are generally 2 additional rice dishes), saag paneer, naan, tandori chicken , chicken masala, goat curry, and rice pudding. (I'm sure i missed 1 or 2)... The employees are always friendly, and accommodating.  If you enjoy delicious, authentic Indian cuisine, give them a try!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, both for the buffet at lunch, and dinner. I have enjoyed everything I've ever tried. The buffet is great for everyone, including vegetarians. It's also a great opportunity to try new things, for those that tend to find something they like, and stick to it. They have a spicy vegetable soup on the buffet called sambar. It's not on the dinner menu, but can be ordered at any time. It's my favorite and super delicious on a cold day."}
{"text":"Dinner is expensive. Each dish is around $11.95 and above which is quite high. The rice in the Chicken biryani was sticking together.

Maybe will try the $8.99 lunch buffet the next time.

Friendly owner who loves to talk."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I will be going back.  First, we arrived at around 5:30 and the place was empty.  As time passed more folks showed up.  I also noticed that they have carry out.

We ordered some apps, vedge and meat samosa' and chicken 'pakor' not sure of the spelling.  All were excellent. 

For the mains, I ordered Butter Chicken (which is why this is a 3 and not a 4 star rating).  It tasted like they had warmed up some caned soup and poured it over the chicken.  No spice, no seasoning...just tomato.  Worst I have ever had, will not eat it again and would not recommend it.  But there is a bright side....

Wife had Chicken Korma, daughter had Chicken Biryani and other daughter had a  Jalfrezi.  All of these were not quite what I am used to from a robust flavor perspective, but they were all very good.  As an example, Korma is usually on the sweet side and has a good hint coconut milk.  Not in this case, but it was still really good. By themselves this could be a 4 star experience, but that dang butter chicken just sucked the life out of the stars."}
{"text":"The quality of the buffet food here is better than all the Indian take out places around, plus its  cheaper and its a buffet!

Don't come here at night it cost more and it's not a buffet."}
{"text":"Far and away the best and most authentic Indian food in Northeast Ohio. The quality of the ingredients is exceptional. Service is amazing and perhaps the best part of all they have a lunch buffet so if you are new to the type of food you can sample a good variety."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants that I have been to.  The food is very good.  The service is wonderful.  I love the chicken chili!   The also serve southern Indian so you have lots of options on the menu.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I, as fans of Indian food, usually eat brunch buffet on weekend. If you go there right after they open (say around 11:30am) most of their selections are fresh and good. Today when we tried tandoori chicken it was a bit cold, but it was not as bad as I need to give lower rating. The price is very reasonable - about $11 per person. You can try naan, chicken biryani, basmati rice, paneer, chicken masala, two kinds of soups (veggie and yellow colored soup tasting like a spiced potato), various kinds of chutneys and rice pudding dessert and many more.. We love this restaurant and we will definitely try this again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars -

I went to the Taj India Palace last weekend and had buffet with a number of friends from church.  Having loaded up the metal trays with piles of curry, naan, pakora, and other sundries, we were treated back at the table with fresh Dosa, complimentary.

While I can't speak to whether their food is more bangladeshi or indian, I will say that the price point, it's a reasonably good deal compared to other south asian restaurants in the area.

Decor is sparse, but service friendly and with a bit of tongue in cheek humor.  

When our party moved to pay singly, the cashier's first move was to subtly, wryly offer to put it all on one card.  :)

The twinkle in the eye was accompanied by a pause as the card hovered over his credit card reader, and he then added, \"only kidding...\"

To the place's credit a number of my meal-mates had mentioned that a number of their south asian colleagues preferred this place for their Cleveland options."}
{"text":"When you say Taj and Palace all in the name - you expect something unique maybe exotic but I'm willing to settle for just let's say 'tasty' -  so we decided to have the lunch buffet that had so many amazing five star reviews.  My oh my!  I must say I'm truly appalled at the quality and taste of the food served here. 

My humble opinion - save your money - this food is neither hot nor spicy nor tasty. The pakoras were like golf balls - rock solid.  The utthappam tasted like rubber with onions. The raitha was souuur - and the coconut chutney was made with stale coconut!  The idlis were invisible - honestly, they never appeared in the buffet dish that was marked 'idli'. The sambhar was without any dal and looked pitiful. Why would anyone recommend this!  

We decided to leave the desserts alone - didn't feel the love ;)

I'm off to some good coffee and pastry place to clean out and recuperate my sad taste buds!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Fair prices. Naan served burnt at times. But overall good place. Good location. Friendly."}
{"text":"Hmm..... where to start?

Had this been a few years ago, I would be giving four or more stars. I've eaten at this restaurant many times. Never before has it been so bad. I know it was once called Maharaja - it was good then. 

Let's start with the service, shall we? Uh...what service? That about sums it up. 

Moving on to the food... It tasted good. It was obviously prepared fresh. However, it was measly. I ordered lamb korma and I think I got MAYBE six pieces of lamb. Had there been more protein in my dish I would have been completely satisfied - but given that there was almost nothing there it did not justify the price I paid for my meal. And the rice? My sister and I were expected to share a small plate. We were nearly fighting over it. I have stab wounds in my hands from her fork. We ordered dosai too and it was not at all like the dosai I had last time I was there. Disappointing.

The ambiance has always sucked. It's so bad that it makes you want to jump out of your chair and leave - or maybe that's just me and I'm a freakin' lunatic. I get itchy and start to tic when things are really out of place. When you've got 10 different pieces of framed artwork on your walls and 9 of them are crooked or broken/dirty looking - it's time to straighten those babies out! 

I dunno. I don't like giving negative reviews. But after eating at India Garden in Lakewood, I kept telling myself that this place was better. It's just not true anymore!! *whine*"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food in a no frills strip mall. Butter chicken, masala dosa, samosas, nan- all delicious. I have eaten in many great Indian restaurants all over the US and this is on par with the best!"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment numerous times over the last 10 years.  In fact, I used to frequent this place back when it was called \"Maharaja.\"  Despite the change in name several years back, everything is still pretty much the same.

There aren't too many Indian restaurants on the east-side of Cleveland, so this one tends to be pretty popular if anything because there isn't much competition.  Taj India Palace is unique in that the cuisine is extremely varied.  They serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes spanning from all regions of India.  Comprehensive one-stop Indian cuisine, if you will.  

I wouldn't come here expecting a first class dining experience.  The restaurant is on the smaller side and is part of a strip mall complex on the corner of Wilson Mills and Richmond roads.  The service is okay, but nothing terribly special.  It's about par for the course for Indian restaurants.  

You come to this place for the food.  While the buffet is solid and has a tremendous selection, the individual menu items is where it's at.  The food here is absolutely delicious and is served in large quantities.  This is perhaps the only place on the east-side where you can get true South Indian food including dosai and iddly, both of which are excellent.  

Highly recommended for take-out or casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. Excellent food and value. I once took an Indian friend from out of town here and he said it was the best buffet he ever had. Nice owner and great speedy service. $10 for lunch Buffett and I walk out in a better place than they are after eating about $50 in goat, chicken and naan.  Go early around 11:30. It's fresh and full. Load up and eat like your being paid!"}
{"text":"I live just a mile or so away from Taj and I can't believe I haven't tried this place before now.   i frequent the Southern Indian takeout place that isn't too far from here, but today, I was in the mood to \"eat-in\" and thought that I would try this place out.  I stopped in on a weeknight, early evening.   There were a few other diners in the restaurant.  I was seated promptly.  I must say, the restaurant was clean, carpet, cloth tablecovers, glass overlay, cloth napkins, water GLASSES, not cups.  The menu is huge and includes Northern and Southern Indian entrees.   I opted for the Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala and Paratha flatbread.   The Samosas (2) were delicious, a little different than I expected but very good.  I'm pretty sure that the outside was a wonton wrapper and then filled with a delicious potato mixture, that was nicely spiced and mild in flavor and freshly cooked, not reheated.  There were two dipping sauces, one was a bit sweet, like hoisin sauce and the other was some type of mild green chile sauce (I would have preferred a yogurt based sauce).  The main entree arrived shortly thereafter.  Nice portion of Chicken Tikka and huge portion of perfectly cooked, fluffy basmati rice.   The Tikka sauce was zesty and flavorful, with just the tiniest bit of heat at the very end.  The chicken was tender and juicy.   There was enough that I ate until I was full and then still had more than 1/2 remaining to take home.  The Paratha bread was excellent, homemade and cooked in the tandoori.  Nice fluffy layers, brushed with butter.    My water glass was never empty, service was prompt & efficient.  All-in-all, this was a great meal.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here on the weekends at the buffet for a couple of years. First heard about this place on Yelp. We love it. My wife loves to make her own stuffed Dosa from all the vegetarian dishes. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite. They change the buffet for Mother's Day and Father's Day so we make sure to go on those days each year. We eat here at least twice a month. The owner is very friendly. Their Tandoori Chicken is excellent."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I really like Indian food. I'm a big ethnic food eater. Before finding out about Taj I used to go to Hot or Mild. I did a search on yelp for Indian buffet as I was curious if there was one on the east side of Cleveland. The results showed a few and today I decided to go with Taj India Palace. I never really go down the Wilson mills area/Richmond Mall area so I had to use my GPS. The restaurant is located in a little shopping plaza with Daves super market being the biggest part at the end. This location is pretty much across from the mall. I walked in just shy of noon and to my surprise only seen one table occupied. My first thoughts were well maybe they are slow but it is lunch time(by the time a left a hour later 3.4ths the dinning room was full). I was promptly greeted by a nice lady and was seated. I immediately went to the buffet to check out the offerings. You have a table next to the buffet that offers regular plates or you can use a metal plate more authentic option with dividers on it. The first table offers all the top meat dishes, the offerings on this table were tandoorie chicken, chicken tika masala, and chili chicken the table also included the naan bread. The next two buffets were filled with items such as cooked cabbage two different kinds of soups a dish with chick peas another with mixed veg. and it had pakora. The last table had chutneys and cold items. I really enjoy chicken tika masala so I ate my fair share of that dish. The tandorie chicken was nicely spiced and very very tender chicken meat and the onions in the pan tasted really good. I tried one soup called yellow dal I enjoyed that. I honestly tried a lot of stuff most of which I have no clue what was in it. None of it tasted bad I'm just a meat eater so the veg dishes aren't a big deal to me.A few minutes after you sit they bring out a item called dosa a type of crepe filled with potatoes you dip into chutney's. I will definitely be back for more as I pay $15 just for dinner carry out at hot or mild and I paid a little over $9 for my lunch buffet. Oh I also forget they offer two different kinds of rice one plain and another was lemon of some sort. They offer a buffet on the weekend for a few dollars more I asked what the difference was all I can recall was that have a goat dish I don't like goat to the best of my knowledge. I might try this place on the weekend to see the difference but This will be my go to spot now when I have time to stop in no longer will I go to hot or mild as much. I do wish the buffet included the items to make papdi chat that will be my only complaint haha Also the naan while most of it was soft some was crunchy but i'm sure that's just from sitting on a hot table. Go give this place your business. Even if you have never had Indian food before I ask you to ask your self a question. Why limit your self on food? Why not try ethnic foods? You might really enjoy it. The staff that I spoke with were very pleasant I even had a chat with a man who rang me out haha"}
{"text":"Was craving Indian buffet for lunch and didn't want to go far. Taj was the closest... and for $8.99 pp, it was the most reasonably priced in the area, so why not? I wasn't expecting much... it's a pretty plain, non-assuming restaurant. The buffet selection isn't the most expansive, but... I was a bit surprised about the quality of the food. It was actually pretty good! They had the staples of Tandoori chicken, which is one of my favorites. The chicken tikka masala was also very good... perfectly spiced for my liking. Lots of naan, some vegetarian selections. And they had rice pudding for dessert, which was also enjoyable. Overall, I was pretty satisfied and would go back again."}
{"text":"Good lunch buffet, never too busy. They need a better selection of non vegetarian dishes. It's been the same 2 chicken dishes and curry goat for the last 2 years. They need to throw some vindaloo, paneer dishes and samosas. For $10 a head, it isn't the best buffet, but then again, Indian food isn't the easiest to cook. This place could be a lot better with only a few minor changes."}
{"text":"I tried them last night for the first time. Outside the restaurant is smelt like burnt garbage. It was better once we got inside. We were greeted by a fairly unfriendly hostess who didn't smile at us once. She sat us down and gave us all of 2 minutes to look at the menu and asked us for our order. Luckily I knew what I wanted. The wait for our food wasn't that long but I was disappointed when it arrived. the portion of my lamb vindaloo was so small. My husband and I usually split dishes but there was only enough for me. I also ordered it extra spicy and it was spicy but bland because of the lack of salt. My husband ordered the lamb biryani. He complained about his lamb being dried out and tough. Our order of garlic naan was severely burnt on the bottom. With all that said I will not be returning to try any other dishes from them. My experience was overall very bad."}
{"text":"Not a frequent Indian food diner but we enjoyed this restaurant very much..  Had both chicken and lamb dishes, good nan bread.  Would go back again and recommend."}
{"text":"Do not go here for the lunch buffet, they can't handle the crowd. All of the chicken dishes were out of chicken, so they just had a buffet of sauce labeled chicken. I was there for an hour and none of it was replenished. The pakoras were burnt. Our server never took drink orders."}
{"text":"My fiancé tried to get me to come here months ago, but I stuck my nose up in disgust. Disgust from the memories of the first time I ever ate Indian food. It was a buffet in Columbus and I told myself I will never eat Indian food again. 
Well, I finally gave in and here I am writing a five star review. Our waitress was the most adorable little Indian lady who so happily greeted us at the door. She suggested the garlic naan and samosas for starters, which were AMAZING! When you come here I was told tandoori anything is a must, so I settled for the tandoori chicken which came out sizzling to perfection. And was so tender it fell right off of the bone. He ordered lamb korma and gave me the thumbs up sign as he chewed his first bite. We also ordered the sabzi curry as a side dish, I couldn't help myself but go back for seconds and thirds and fourths of the sabzi curry! We will be returning, and I have a new found love for Indian food."}
{"text":"Tried the buffet - pretty good variety for the price. The complimentary dosas are ok. I particularly like their vegetarian selection. Overall, worth visiting if you are really hungry and would like to try different varieties."}
{"text":"I found this place recently, and I am mad! Mad that I didn't know about it sooner!

The food is top notch, I've been cruising through the menu trying as much as I can. I have made this a once a week stop, since discovering it. (Note: Asking for the Vindaloo to be \"very spicy\" was unwise. Delicious, but unwise.) 

I've dined in, and carried out, service is excellent either way.  The staff is friendly, and everything comes out quick. 

If you like indian food, get your butt over to this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"My family is a huge fan of Indian food, and this place definitely made the cut. The paper dosai is amazing, and we loved the curry's we've tried this far. This was only our first time here, but I'm sure it's going to be a weekly staple!"}
{"text":"I went to this place once during lunch buffet and the food was just okay. The gravy's were too watery making the quality not up to standards of a quality Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here this past Sunday. I was having some outpatient surgery Monday and only wanted one meal and wanted to be full. Kind of like a last supper deal. So for 11 dollars I went to the can you eat all buffet. Note - what ever you where in there will smell like Indian food for the rest of the day! I started out with some daal soup and and spicy vegetable soup. (Not that spicy for me nothing was super spicy.) Both the soups were well balanced and very tasty. Great for dipping naan in. Next the goat dish was decent. Lots of work, lots of bones to pick through, tasted like an Indian version of pot roast! The Butter Chicken was tasty and it was not overwhelming. There was also a vegetable and chicken rice dishes. Both good and fairly authentic. The Paneer was decent. There was a chickpea curry type of dish that was quite tasty also. There were some pea pancakes that where meh, probably good for mopping up sauce. Lastly some fried vegetable turd like nuggets. They were quite good, I'm thinking their base was of daal or chickpea, but tasted a little bit like falaffel. Quite nice I must say. I did not have room for anything else. 

On a side note there was a 50/50 Indian/Gringo customer average, so you can read into that however you want : ) The service was very efficient, I never had to ask for water, which is huge in my humble opinion. So if you have 13 bucks, its Sunday, want to eat a lot of Indian food, smell like Indian food, and feel stuffed from Indian food, this is your place. Check this out, some very cool music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtn1twhC34"}
{"text":"Very convenient for meal before or after a movie. I enjoyed the lamb curry.  The portions were generous I think for an Indian restaurant and price was average.  I prefer saffron patch but this is a good choice if i happen to be in this part of town. It's not particularly memorable but the people were nice and the food was prepared quickly."}
{"text":"First up, this restaurant is not even Indian. It is run by a Bangladeshi couple and the food is pretty much Bangladeshi. It is really unfortunate that some Bangladeshi and Pakistani restaurants  try to pass off as Indian - is it just so they can get more customers? I don't know but it is interesting. I have been to a few Pakistani restaurants and the food tastes pretty good. Why cant they just claim they're a Pakistani restaurant, people will still go there to eat.

Taj India Palace is just not good. I feel bad writing this. The food is stale sometimes, poor tasting, and sub-par at best. The Naans are a joke. I am well aware that Indian restaurants have a funky smell because of the spices but this place (although not Indian) takes that funky smell to another level!

If you really want to eat quality/authentic Indian food please try another place! The best place in the area in my opinion is: India Garden in Lakewood.

I really hope someday the Taj India Palace restaurant is re-named Taj Bangladeshi Palace. 

The only reason I would come back to this place is because the owner seems like a nice chap. He is polite and I like supporting such people even if their product is not up to snuff."}
{"text":"Buffets aren't great for people who know Indian food. Ordered food is great, service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is good however could be hotter on the buffet. But the flavors are tasty . Only had the buffet on weekend but choices are good. Would reccomend... Nice vegetarian choices..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for lunch. The food is great and the owners are very nice people."}
{"text":"On the weekends Taj India Palace has a buffet until 3. It has a great mix of North and South Indian foods, so there's meat and vegetarian dishes. They also give each customer an order of masala dosa with your meal! I love masala dosas!! Dosas are thin crepe-like pancakes wrapped around potatoes that have been cooked with delicious spices. The complementary dosa is a bit smaller than regular dosas normally are, but yummy nonetheless. I can't complain, I'm getting dosa, and a buffet of food for a decent price. 

The place is great for large groups, and you never have to worry about waiting for a table. The workers are nice, and can answer any questions you have. I've been here multiple times for the buffet, so I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Probably a little biased in that I love indian food and cleveland selection (at least what I've found) has been lacking.  But the food was delicious, the decor plain, and the waiters friendly.  But most of all, the food was delicious! Some friends and I had a sudden urge for indian, and I just searched on my phone for anything near by while we were driving.  Lucked out huge in finding this place.  We got there at about 15 minutes before close (i felt bad, but was starving) and the wait staff was friendly and seated us in the main room.

When we ordered our food we were a little unsure and our waiter was happy to assist us and make suggestions after asking our interests.  we ended up with a lamb dish and chicken curie and chicken curry with some naan.

The food was the best I've had in cleveland by far (meaning its better than Saffron Patch and the one off of taylor and cedar.)  The portions were solid (but not large, naan was a good choice to complete the meal) and the dishes spiced wonderfully.  They had a good kick, but still focused on flavor over heat. The meats were tender and the veggies pungent.  The rice was cooked perfectly. If anything, I thought the naan left a little to be desired and could have been softer and fluffier, but I was still ecstatic to scoop out the main courses with it.  My favorite indian in cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The food is really flavorful and the price is fair. The best thing to do is probably the lunch buffets. You get a ton of choices (both vegetarian and not).
I recommend tandoori chicken in Thursday's or the goat curry on fridays. Also the rice pudding is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian on the East side. We always get the palak paneer, masala dosa, and chicken tikka."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. Great food and friendly service. I highly recommend it to Indian food enthusiasts."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice for lunch. The food is very good,  you get large portions and the price is very fair. I will continue to order from this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Indian restaurant for years, despite the multiple name changes, some bad customer service experiences, and even a stomach ache or two. BUT, I'm happy to report that the latest iteration of this restaurant is pretty darn good. At least at lunchtime. For a measly $10 you can choose from an all you can eat buffet, which features tons of different types of entrees, including a large selection of vegetarian options. (which are in a completely different buffet line) The naan is always freshly stocked and there are even a couple dessert items intermingled with the other dishes. 

On my most recent trip, I was one of only a few non Indian patrons, and I took this to be a good sign. If you haven't been to this ever-changing restaurant in a little while, give it another try. You might just like it this time around."}
{"text":"Our family gets take out from this restaurant all the time, they know my dad on a first name basis. And 99.9% of the time our order is always the same, butter chicken extra spicy and garlic naan. However today when my dad called to place the order and picked it up without checking because we order the same thing every time. When he came home and we were about to eat, noticed they gave us plain naan instead of garlic naan which is what we ordered. When my dad called to notify the restaurant, they turned it around and made it his fault stating he never said garlic. Seriously, what kind of establishment blames their customer? And even if it was an oversight, why not offer to fix the problem instead of arguing with the customer. Clearly our business is not important to you, don't worry we will find another restaurant to order from, one that isn't rude and disrespectful. Typical FOB mentality."}
{"text":"The lunch Buffet is excellent, but changes daily.  I enjoy the service, and menu selections."}
{"text":"Such a shame you can't give zero stars on yelp. My friend ate here having told the waiter he had a severe nut allergy but was served something with nut ingredients in them anyway and was sent to the ER shortly after!! This is absolutely unacceptable and I hope they go out of business soon."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled across Taj India Palace by accident, forcing my poor companion to order take out with me.  Of all the things I miss about NYC, savory, mouth tingling Indian food with toasty, soft piles of naan is very close to the top of the list.

As I always do in unknown Indian restaurant territory, I case out the joint.  I find the least impressive, most bland, most disappointing dish on the menu and order it.  If they can make it delicious, they win and I will return to sample the rest of their fare.  That's right--I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala in mild. 

...and it was wonderful, flavorful, spicy, moist boneless chicken heaven.  The accompanying naan was perfect (and ample--bonus!). My companion had some other dish I've never heard of, and it was even better.  Please note they have a very large menu and it can be difficult to choose a single entree.

Our appetites whetted, we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This is our 'go to' Indian Restaurant! Food is always great, staff is super nice and always remembers our names. I've heard the buffet is great however we haven't gone because it is only offered at lunchtime."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every few weeks. I have never had a bad experience and never expect to. The food is so delicious that if I had to pick a last meal, this would be it. We've tried something from every part of the menu and it has never disappointed. I'm usually a stickler for high standards when it comes to cleanliness and the appearance of a restaurant. The food outweighs any of that in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine from the south region of India.  Service is very good when the usual waitress does it, more of a curt transaction when the gentlemen waiters do it.  
We had chai tea (excellent), vindaloo (also excellent), plain naan, and three southern dishes that my Indian friend pronounced excellent.  We also had the mildly spiced samosas.  I have also enjoyed the large buffet here, which is diverse and inexpensive.  My Indian friends were, overall, pleased with this place."}
{"text":"My first Indian food experience and I really enjoyed it.  Now I really don't know how to judge Indian food so I brought along Mridul, from India but in US for work, to Taj for some good times, spicy cuisine, and some chilly beers.  I was really torn on my choice for the night, but between Taj and Cafe Tandoor, Taj won based on location and previous reviews.  Not to mention that this is close to my house so if the food was good, I could come here often.

We started off the night right with a beer that Mridul compered to Bud Light in the US, which is King Fisher in India.  The beer was good, little bite, but I could drink this stuff on a regular basis.  We opted for an appetizer to begin our feast.  We decided to go with the India Palace Special Platter - Combination of seekh kebab, chicken tikka, samosa and pakora.  Best way to sum this dish up was that I told him that this would be perfect for those hangover days where all you wanted was some deep fried goodness.  Everything but the lamb sausage and Chicken tikka was fried.  One of the items was an onion ball (not really a ball) that was delicious.  I enjoyed everything on the platter.

For dinner we decided to share a couple things just to see how authentic this place was.  The one item that Mridul kept talking about is Butter Chicken so that, for me, was a must have.  We also decided to go with the Dall Makni - Lentils cooked in butter with fresh onions, garlic, ginger and tomatoes, then topped with coriander.  Both dishes were accompanied by garlic naan, onion naan, and puri roti - Deep fried puffed light bread, all 3 breads we had to pay for but everything came with a plate full of nicely cooked white rice which cut the heat of the dishes really well.

I will tell you that, in my opinion, the butter chicken was delicious, I absolutely loved it.  The makni was spicy, but also really good, I will tone it down next time I get it because it did go perfectly with both of the naans as did the butter chicken.  I couldn't decide which naan I liked more so do yourself a favor and get both, you'll eat it.  My least favorite was the roti, but by least favorite I mean it was good but I figured I needed to pick out one dish that I didn't absolutely love.  Then again the wife loved it.  She said it reminded her of an elephant ear from the carnival minus the sugar and cinnamon, I agreed.  Guess you could consider that our desert because we were stuffed and couldn't eat another thing.

So we all sat around and talked about the authenticity of Taj.  While I had nothing to go on or compare to, I really just asked the questions where Mridul answered.  Some highlights are this.  When asked how it compared to, on a scale of 1-5, food in India, he gave it a 3 but if he was comparing it to US options, specifically Cleveland, even more specific - Indian Palace, he said it gets a solid 4.   He did enjoy the lentil dish more at Indian Palace in Lakewood but the butter chicken has his vote here at Taj.  He said the naan was spot on, the tandoor chicken was seasoned great, and that the only thing that the restaurant didn't do traditionally was to serve the plates warm.  Taj did offer water with no ice which was the first thing that he noticed and complimented.  That kind of started out the night on a good note.

The restaurant itself is relatively small but each table is given enough leg room and buffer where you can feel free to converse / frolic about yourself without the thread of eavesdroppers.  There is a smell to the place that does stay with you for a while but when you use bold ingredients like the Indian do, I 100% expected it.  The service was great, prices seemed reasonable, and clientele were 75% Indian and 25% other on a late Friday night. 

So overall I guess you could say that we really did enjoy the dinner at Taj India Palace and I will be back, if not just to get some things to go.  If you haven't been in, give it a shot, but keep in mind that not all Indian food will satisfy.  We were lucky to have a tour guide as Mridul noted probably 7-10 dishes that we would not like and it was really an acquired taste.  My recommendation, play it safe.  Medium-Hot is a good spice level, don't over do it or else it will light your insides on fire.  I am proud to say I am a big fan of Indian food."}
{"text":"We went on one of the Friday night and ordered several dishes. For me as meat lover, I ordered the mixed grill. My wife ordered the palak paneer and dal. It's ok Indian food for me as I experienced more authentic Indian food in Asia. They seem like holding back on the seasonings. I am not sure if demographic taste preferences. The flavoring is a little too mild for my taste. 

The vegetarian sampler appetizer was a little too homogeneous. I don't think we got the variety as stated in the menu. The samosas were good but  not memorable. The naan bread with raisin and coconut was very good.

Seems like only one waiter could speak English. The other didn't really speak to us. The service is great and decent food, My heart still goes to the Indian take out on Mayfield road which is more well prepared and more authentic Southern Indian food. 

I have tasted better Indian food and food seasoned Indian way."}
{"text":"I am a little bias, but this food is delicious! Great food, friendly people, and relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and very quiet. Love everything I've tried there. I've been going there for a few years. I like introducing it to new people to share the amazing food. It is reasonably priced for the high quality delights!"}
{"text":"There is a very distinct lack of any Indian restaurants on the eastside of Cleveland and Taj India Place is pretty much it.  

My husband and I tried it out last week and were pleasantly surprised.  I was skeptical at first because there was no one there when we arrived, but the place was pretty full about 20 minutes later.  

We got the vegetarian sampler appetizer, which consisted of all fried foods.  The samosas were good, but the rest I could do without.  I think next time I would just order the samosas.  I got the palak paneer and yellow dal.  My husband got the mixed grill.  Everything was well seasoned and tasty.  I'm not someone that can tolerate spicy food and all the dishes had just enough spice for me.  They have both northern and southern Indian dishes to suit your taste.  The naan was very fresh and they have several different types.  

The service was very attentive and fast.  

I would definitely go back to try more dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday for lunch. All other Indian cuisine places were closed in the area and I was craving for some curry. They had a buffet style lunch with chicken, beef, and vegetarian curry. I tried them all!!! For $11.95 buffet they have a decent food selection including unlimited naan and a desert section. I will definitely come back for some more curry in the future."}
{"text":"They have great food! My takeout order was nice and hot when I picked it up. There was no wait. They place looked and smelled clean. They gave my friend and I plenty of food. It was great!
I will order from them again."}
{"text":"We ate here a few days ago and were very impressed. We had the chicken tikka bhuna and the chicken tikka masala. The food was well flavored and the portion size was good for the price. I would have liked for there to be more heat (my dish was supposedly flavored medium-hot), but it was still really good. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my first review, I've been to Taj at least four times.  I really love the food here!  It's not too spicy, so I can enjoy the intricate flavors that are put into each dish.

Today, several of my co-workers and I went to Taj for the lunch buffet.  It costs $9.80 and they serve you water.  If you want a drink, sure, you can order one, but typically, you walk in, you are greeted and asked, \"How many\", and guided to head straight to the buffet.

The first thing you're going to see at the lunch buffet is Tandoori Chicken.  This is marinated chicken on the bone that's red in color.  It tastes pretty good, but I usually don't get this.  The next dish is Chicken Tikka Masala.  This is chunks of boneless chicken breast mixed with a butter, tomato, and lots of herbs sauce.  It is one of my favorite dishes on the buffet.  There are approximately 14 dishes (3 meat, 6 veggie, 3 bread, and 2 rice).

There's the typical Indian bread (Naan), plus little yummy Indian pancakes (Khana) that are really tasty and great to dip in the various sauces that are in each dish.  Today, they served curried cauliflower and potatoes, which was just okay.  The rock star of today's buffet was the curried spinach with peas and carrots.  I absolutely loved the taste of this dish and I wanted more.  Heck, I want some right now!

I also got some yellow rice, some red chutney (for a little extra kick), some curried chick peas, and a curried corn dish that reminded me of good old creamed corn.  These dishes were okay, but all I really wanted is the Chicken Tikka (especially the sauce!), the bread, and the spinach dish.  

The food is not too spicy, but if you like spice, you can add some hot chutney to increase the heat.  Or you can order something spicy from the kitchen.

I love the food here.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"The Best Indian Food in the Cleveland area!!
I eat here at least once a month. The service is always great and the staff is extremely friendly.

Lamb dishes are loaded with lamb and very tasty!!

Order a Mango Lassi (they use Rose water)."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine! Try the dosa's and the tandoori chicken and the vegetarian dishes. Really the best cleveland has!
Decor only ok but focus on the flavor."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and it was good. Today I went for lunch buffet. I went up to buffet and roaches where climbing all over the wall behind the buffet! I was so grossed out!!! I will never ever go back to this place it's such a shame they let this place go :("}
{"text":"Place seems almost abandoned when you first come in; we got there early for dinner. Inside is pretty spacious and I imagine they have nights when the place is full, because the food is pretty good and sans other Indian food variety in the area this is a pretty good option. 
We tried their appetizer sample platter. Beware of the deep fried pepper! I thought it was a green bean and bit into it. Oh boy! It's a chili pepper and one of the spiciest yet! Took me a while to be able to taste anything else again that evening.
The butter chicken, which is my favorite Indian dish, is so-so; I've definitely had better. But the shrimp dish was excellent and the naan is very fresh.
I would definitely come back when I feel a craving for Indian food and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Good sign is when half the diners are of Indian descent, that has to mean the food is good.

Indian food around Mentor and east is non-existent so I hoped that this restaurant could be closest to fill the void. And it is! It was a little disappointing to see it wasn't that busy on a Friday night at 8pm but it doesn't help being located in a strip mall. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, very mild and flavorful. My boyfriend got lamb vindaloo, medium-hot, which turned out to be perfectly spicy, enough to enjoy and bring out other flavors but not enough to cry. The naan is so good, we ended up ordering another batch even when we couldn't finish. By the time we left, the restaurant was filling up with more customers.

At home, I ended up fighting over leftovers to see who would eat it! Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall but the food is very good. Go at lunch time and they have a buffet so you can try everything."}
