{"text":"The best steak I have ever tried. This is a combination of Brazilian Picanha steak and their special house style. First time I tried it was the Picanha sandwich in Life is Beautiful event. It was a long line but considering the crowd is pretty fast service. Fortunately I saw them in Foodie Fest and I gotta say that the Picanha plate is much better with their house special sauce of creamy cilantro.The service was fast and excellent. 100% recompensed."}
{"text":"Picanha Steak Truck is one of the better quality food trucks in Vegas. I got to try this truck at the 2016 Great American Foodie Fest and I loved it!

The Picanha can be served on your choice of salad, tacos, by itself, etc. Your picanha steak has a temperature choice of \"rare\", \"medium rare\", \"what are you doing?\", or \"f***ing ruin.\" 

I chose the Picanha Plate. It was served will picanha steak, caesar salad, and fries. I ordered rare steak, but it was probably medium cooked.....although it was still really soft and delicious. The caesar salad was amazing and I would honestly come back to get the Picanha Salad. The fries were okay, but they were very salty so I couldn't eat them. 

I love their food, just had a bad first experience. But now I know what I like from this food truck so I'm sure to order the right thing next time!"}
{"text":"Badass foodtruck in Vegas! had it at Life is beautiful, these people know that a steak should be pink not F*cking Ruined as advertised lol. Must try stop in Vegas"}
{"text":"I've gone to the picanha steak truck multiple times and it never disappoints every single time the food is absolutely delicious and the service is amazing. The steak is always cooked to perfection the fries are awesome, all of the sauces are delicious. I highly recommend visiting the picanha steak truck when you get a chance it won't disappoint the food is absolutely top notch!"}
{"text":"The price and food quality is amazing. The flavor is so good. It's fresh to order and everything I ordered was dam tasty. The steak tacos so good. The steak sandwich was also dam good. I can't wait to try them again."}
{"text":"The best in town. The service was great and also the food. You have to give them a chance. You wont regret."}
{"text":"I was expecting something regular, but after ordering the special \"picanha plate\" my expectations were over surpassed. I decided to follow trough Instagram because this is my new favorite place for eat!! They are everywhere."}
{"text":"Quality wise, this truck is five stars. The meat was flavorful and tender. Selection wise, the truck is lacking. This is the reason I likely won't be back to Picanha. The Picanha Plate is just meat, fries and a salad. The tacos look eh- and if I wanted a taco I would probably go for a taco truck instead. I need more delicious steak options!

My Picanha adventure included a steak salad. Although you can sub steak for another kind of meat - or even no meat - you can't get another kind of salad. This selection was entirely my fault as I didn't read the whole description and assumed it would have a tangy steak-suitable dressing. My unawareness ruined me, the only salad they serve here are caesar salads. The steak was so good it left me craving some cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette to make a truly delicious steak salad. I don't think red meat goes well on a caesar but that may just be my preference. This was the best part of my meal, probably four stars alone and if I loved caesar I would have loved it.

The second thing I ordered were parmesan fries. While the parmesan on our fries was crispy, browned, and photographed well it didn't MELT. Which means it was flakey hot pieces of parmesan cheese that were impossible to get to stick to our fries. While I was eating them I was distinctly daydreaming of the same fries covered in mozzarella, the delicious steak they serve, and A1. 

As you can see, none of my complaints here about about the quality or cooking but rather the options. Make a steak salad with balsamic vinaigrette or some BOMB cheesy steak fries and I will be the first person back in line!!"}
{"text":"absolutely life changing experience!!! try it i'm only partially exaggerating promise."}
{"text":"got to try this truck at First Friday. sticking with the name sake I had the picanha sandwich that came with fries. the meat itself was tender but I did have several fatty pieces that were unappetizizing and I am all for some fat on steak being a ribeye fan. Not the worst sandwich but for $14 it should have been a bit more over the top. Just some greens and an unnoticed sauce on a bun."}
{"text":"Excellent steak !!! I was able to try their food last week but I could not comment on anything, it's a super soft and juicy meat !!!! Really 100% recommendable, every time I see this truck in the events I will certainly eat at it!"}
{"text":"This food truck showed up at my job (Tesla) and I tried the steak fries for $11 a little pricey but sounded worth the price never again they never asked how I wanted my steak cooked so I figured since it's steak FRIES they would naturally be served well done well I was wrong the steak was very bloody and bleed out on my fries EW the steak was a cheap cut of steak because it was very fatty and gummy the worst steak fries I've ever eaten and by the time I got to my desk and started on my food the truck had left so I wasn't able to return it so I decided to post my experience on Yelp."}
{"text":"1 of my favorite food trucks at work! 3 beef taco meal is the bomb! The folks on this truck could not be nicer. Food is hot and ready in about 10 minutes. You guys are great!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a phoenix to rise from the ashes of the old Street Dogs truck. This ain't no phoenix.

Picanha Steak Truck is a new truck from the owner of the Street Dogs truck. I saw him multiple times at Great American Foodie Fest and spoke with him briefly, and I also noticed him at Sunset Park'd yesterday. Bearing in mind that the old Venezuelan street food truck was one of my favorite food trucks and that pretty much none of the items survived their rebranding, I had huge expectations.

The menu is simple: unless you want the shrimp option for some dishes, you're going to be eating a Brazilian-named cut of beef, which is available in 4 levels of cooking temperature from rare all the way to \"f***ing ruined,\" a colorful sentiment with which most meat lovers can surely agree. The options include sandwich, plate, and salad, but I went with...

Tacos ($10 for 3): easily shared with friends. The medium-rare beef is tender but doesn't compare in flavor to the picanha cut at Brazilian BBQ restaurants. I suppose the veggies and green sauce were fine, but nothing special either. I'm tired of seeing tortillas not treated in any way by food trucks when any hole in the wall taqueria cooks them in oil, and those tortillas are here again. The upside is that the price is pretty good for a food truck.

Fried Green Plantains ($5): nothing like the sweet plantains found in Venezuelan cuisine. They were crispy outside and soft inside, and minimal or no batter was needed for that texture, but it was hard to detect any plantain flavor. I think they needed to salt the mashed plantains before and not after cooking. The sauce contributed nothing and I had to go back for Sriracha and ketchup, both of which add more flavor.

I may try Picanha Steak Truck's sandwiches or plates, but only if I see them at another local food truck gathering or if they otherwise come to Henderson again. For now, it looks like the magic is gone and the bird is dead."}
{"text":"The best tacos that I tried in my life. The beef was awesome and the service was the best. Do not miss the shrimp tacos. I will go again soon for sure."}
{"text":"To say it in a nice way, the food is not good. The beef was overcooked, dry and had a sour taste to it. Salsa was bland. These food trucks are getting worse. Save yourself some time and go to an authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The best picanha ever!!
Picanha it's the Brazilian national cut of beef and me as a Brazilian believe this is the best place to eat picanha sandwich! Great service as well. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Best streak Fries ever! Will alway follow no matter where they move too!!!"}
{"text":"dry meat, basically all one temp. No seasoning, obviously uninspired workers as customer service was awful.  Sooo many better options, skip this one."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. They're rude and the food isn't that good. Got two things. The steak tacos and the salad. I would rather have had just steak but they don't give just steak alone. So. I ordered the steak tacos and the steak salad. I didn't want the French fries that came with it, so i I asked to have one extra taco. I even said I would pay however much extra that would cost. 6, 10$ whatever it cost. The girl said NO!!! Are you serious? I offered to pay however much extra it cost. But apparently they can't do that. That's ridiculous... this place is not worth it"}
{"text":"Just had a steak plate at the foodie festival and it was amazing!!!  Parmesan fries, Caesar salad and the most delicious steak, tender, juicy and flavorful!!  Wish I could eat this everyday!!"}
{"text":"This food truck is amazing. I had the steak sandwich and it may have been the best steak sandwich I have ever had anywhere. The steak itself was juicy and full of flavor yet was so tender I could bite clean thru the sandwich. The additions of the greens, cheese sauce, and cherry tomatoes really helped elevate the sandwich and the toasted bun kept everything together until the last bite. The fries I thought would not matter but still they where perfectly cooked and I ended up finishing them all with the sandwich. Overall incredible I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I tried the picanha steak sandwich and after the first bite this instantly became one of my favorite food trucks.  The steak was perfectly cooked exactly how I liked it medium rare and so flavorful.  It also comes with this sauce that has a perfect kick to it, I wanted to dip it in everything!! I wish this was not just a food truck, but a restaurant that I can go in a regular basis.   If I wasn't so full, I would get seconds.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu !"}
{"text":"Just had Picanha Steak sandwich at the Food Truck Frenzy in Southern Highlands! Great food! Amazing customer service. We were looking at all of the other menus and were on the fence when the cook offered a sample of the picanha meat. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Definitely recommend everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"Tried this truck out during LIB and it was great. The steak was juicy and flavorful. We also had the plantains which had a good crisp to them but so soft on the inside. The green sauce was great too. Not too spicy either. Def worth a try."}
{"text":"This taco truck is on a different level, it's like a high end taco truck. The steak tacos are so yummy and full of flavor especially with the chipotle sauce the put on them the meat is so tender. A must try!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was pretty good. I guess they're at the Total Wine and Spirits on Las Vegas Blvd every Thursday. 

I only ordered the picanha steak tacos. The veggies were fresh and everything. There's an option to have it spicy or not. I just asked for it to be on the side if possible. The spicy sauce was not that spicy, just had a zing to it. It was perfect! The steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare but there was only three measly slices on each taco. I think that they should consider cutting them to smaller pieces because when I ate the tacos, I would eat a whole piece of the steak and by the time I was half way through one taco, the rest was just veggies. 

Service was good. The prices are not ridiculous like other food trucks. More steak in smaller pieces please and thank you! 

I'll definitely try them again, just maybe the steak sandwich cause that one looked loaded in steak!"}
