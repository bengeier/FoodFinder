{"text":"Decent coffee and good cookies.  
Would return if in the area.   Interior is a little lack lustre but service is generally good though"}
{"text":"I always go here on weekends for an americano.  It's delicious and the service is amazing!  Next time, I would like to try their brunch."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and they source it locally for good brunch everytime we go there for Brunch. The staff are helpful and sitting outside is wonderful at this time of year. Enjoy the coffee and fresh food."}
{"text":"Great experience. The staff were friendly and the food was tasty. Had a great matcha latte as well!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  I had the egg benny and Arshawn had their home made scone and an egg.  I confirm, the Cortado is exceptional here.  The service was slow, but the staff were super apologetic and it seemed to me this wasn't the usual MO.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the restaurant for the first time today and loved the quiet, more \"neighbourhoody\" vibe that many brunch places in the city lack.  Service was excellent as were the coffee and our respective meals (I had the smashed avocado and he ordered eggs benedict).  The Christie is definitely a restaurant we are adding to our \"branching list.\""}
{"text":"Tasty brunch, good coffee, and Jeff, the owner is like your own personal welcoming committee"}
{"text":"Way over priced. 
Shame cause the place before was affordable and had great coffee."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little place with no more than 10 or so seats but it's a really good find when it comes to brunch.
We had the chia bowl, the eggs florentin and pancakes. Each one was really good . The chia bowl had a lot of fresh fruit with it, the pancakes were fluffy and had some delicious apple compot with it and the eggs were just done as they should.
Bottom line, small quaint coffee / restaurant that is worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is place is a great addition to the neighbourhood.  It has fast and friendly service, and the food and coffee are really high quality. The croissants are the best I've had in the city -slightly crispy on the outside, and deliciously soft and chewy on the inside.  The brunch options are simple but use very high quality ingredients (including Blackbird bread) and are executed perfectly.  We'll be regular customers !"}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing. I've just moved into the area and can say without a doubt one of the best coffees in the city. The food looks great too"}
{"text":"This place has got a lot jammed packed into such a tiny space. 

Their muffins are incredible! I've tried their lemon poppyseed, AMAzing! So moist and the flavours are very balanced. Their citrus muffin is another top-notch baked good, it's got loads of berries not typically found in muffins at other cafes in the city. Making it a healthy alternative as they strive to have good quality ingredients in their menu items, also. Their chocolate brownies are very rich and dense and it tastes like a solid piece of gud chocolate cake, except better because its a brownie, hahaha! 

My mom swears by their coffee. She frequents this spot as it is one of our local cafes. 

For me, I love that they have those craft sodas available. Peach Habanero, delicious! 

Oh and their scones, sooooo good too! 

If you're not there already reading this, you should go and pay them a visit, better get there early to score your tasty treat!"}
