{"text":"It was my first time experiencing nawab Indian restaurant about a week ago, when you first walk in its a nice setting with a really nice smell of Indian food. So we sat down and ordered and 15-20mins later all of our food made it out to the table. It tasted really good with lots of flavour, but the only disappointing part that I was surprised about was how all of the dishes were really light on the meat. In my opinion you should be getting way more meat with your food dishes especially when you're paying this much money for the food. Other than that this restaurant would be one of my go to's if the pice was a little lower and they gave you more meat."}
{"text":"Have called for take out 3 times in a year and been told \"sorry our kitchen is too busy\".The last time it was at 8 pm on a Tuesday. If your kitchen is \"too busy\" then take that option off your website. No matter, there is another great Indian place nearby that always takes my order with a smile. The one time we did eat in the food was mediocre at best, avoid."}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent,excellent tasty food. The chef told us he cooks each dish fresh. Con: very slow service. We waited 30 minutes when there was only 1 other table. A second time we went when the restaurant was full, we waited one hour. Great food, but make sure you don't go when you are starving. Or take a small bite before you go."}
{"text":"Good Day Friends,  Please find below the latest & greatest review.  The group we came with decided to share appetizers and we bought 3 pakoras (Vegetable, chilis and paneer) and Papri Chaat. The pakoras were good but what we would recommend is the Pappri Chaat. It was so good with a little heat topped off with the bitter sweet yogurt. So good!   For the main dish my wife and I had veggie dishes. I had the Okra (extra spicy) and it was good. All you really need with this dish is rice and maybe some naan and you will be set. Looks small but it filled me up. My wife had Chana Masala and she found it a bit spicy but manageable. This coming from a person who doesn't like spicy food that much. She is a vegan so instead of naan she got roti which is made of flour and water only. :/ She like it but I need the real naan. hahaha.  For dessert I had the ice cream but I wish i would have gotten the Gulab Jamun. I have tasted it before but this was different. It was soft, not to sweet and just great! I wouldn't even be able to figure out the rest of it. All in all, it was a good experience. We give it a 4 out of 5 only because of the wait time for our food. Mind you we did have a big group.  Have a wonderful week!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and delicious. The prawn vindaloo is amazing! One of the best Indian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about this restaurant, but were very disappointed. We have eaten Indian food around the world, and this was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The meat was so questionable, that it was either cooked from frozen or was off. The flavours were bland and portion sizes were small.  The service was very slow, and on questioning the food, the staff were rude and not bothered.  There are better places to spend you money."}
{"text":"The get get my vote for worst Indian food in Calgary! Everything taste the same with a little bit of a twist and really there's not much taste it's just bad bad bad!   Much better places in Calgary & with more class that do not have people (them selfs, staff, family & friends) are putting fake reviews on sites saying how good it is but it NOT guess they need to do something to get people to eat there. They got me but NEVER again! The fact they are doing this is discouraging as I love yelp to get a honest reviews not made up ones..."}
{"text":"Caring, attentive staff, and wonderful food. There were 3 of us, and we were all very satisfied. The menus are accurate with their spicy ratings. Newcomers may want to try something else, but those of us that like the hot stuff will really enjoy those as well."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Service was so so but the owner/chef came to our table to introduce himself and ask how dinner was which was a nice touch. We will be back again, next time with friends!"}
{"text":"I did not mind this place one bit! Probably the best Indian place in town. Very easy to tell its 'home cooked' nice atmosphere  Good!"}
{"text":"Better than ever  Had enjoyed the food and ambience downtown. Luckily they have moved to my hood. Great food and extremely pleasant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Skinny: oooh... crispy chewy naan... great curries... amazingly moist tandoori chicken! (5) Service: friendly family owned joint (5). Price: for East Indian - it's pricey but it sure makes up for it in terms of quality.... will save you a trip to India(5).  Dear Nawab,  Thank you for showing me how good East Indian cuisine can be. I've been to many East Indian restaurants since but they've never come close to the food that you serve here.  Thank you for not having a buffet 24/7 - that keeps your quality high even though it probably takes more time and effort on your part. It really makes a difference and I can tell each time I take a succulent moist bite of tandoori chicken.  I have dreams about your naan... my husband does too. That chewy crispy bread is so perfect on every level. We've tried naan at other restaurants including Sensi in Las Vegas. It still doesn't hold to the magic you work with flour.  Your chai is the best and so is your rice pudding. I wish I could write sonnets about how yummy they are.  Finally, thank you for ruining me for all other East Indian restaurants in North America because you're simply the best on this side of the ocean."}
{"text":"Really high quality Indian. One of the most tender and well balanced lamb vindaloo dishes I've ever had. Excellent garlic naan bread and extra-buttery butter chicken. Tried the punjabi dal, which was packed with flavour and spices. The basmati rice was the only thing I found slightly lacking. That's a very minor gripe considering how perfectly crafted the other dishes were.   The take-out comes in pretty robust microwave-safe containers, making it ideal for lazy leftovers. The owner seems passionate and friendly.  Docked one star for pricing/portions. I know all Indian food is expensive, but I found the portion sizes to be smaller than the similarly priced competition. Expect around $85 after tip for a meal for two. The good news is that the quality is certainly there to support the price. Note that the naan bread is big enough for one per person."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm the first person to review this restaurant.  As far as Indian places go, Calgary has quite a lot to choose from, but after trying so many I've discovered that this is the only one that I am willing to go back to time and time again.  Coming here, we don't even order off the menu, we just tell out beautiful waitress to bring us out what she thinks is good that night, and it is always fantastic.  Never had one bad dish from Nawab and I've probably tried 3/4 of their menu!  They do gourmet South Indian cuisine and I come out stuffed every time I eat there.  Tonight we had chai, papri chaat (a favorite of my mom's), Nauratan, Murgh Goa and Gulab Jamum for dessert.  And always Naan, no dinner here would be complete without Naan....  Family atmosphere is what they pride themselves on, the owner and his wife are lovely people who always make you feel at home when you come to visit.  Even the Flames feel the same way, tonight we saw Connie and Iggy is a regular and usually brings his whole family (don't bug them though, it's the Calgary way!).  I highly suggest that you come here, even though there is construction right next door, parking is easy either on the street or across the street in the parking lot ($3.50) but the owner will discount is off your bill at the end of the night.  The bar has a bunch of Flames memorabilia and a big screen TV on which they always have some sort of sports game playing (hockey in season).  We haven't come for the lunch buffet but have heard that it is amazing, if you work downtown near this area you should come and check it out!  http://www.nawabrestaurant.ca/#"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't review this place on the food but I can review them based on their service. According to their website and Yelp, you can order food for takeout, so I went in to order some food to go while I was running errands. I was given a very judgemental look from the waitress when I asked to order food to go and then she went back to talk to a lady who I assume was the manager. The \"manager\" came back and asked me what I wanted and she asked if I had a reservation. I told her I didn't, but according to their website they have a takeout menu. She informed me that they were busy (restaurant was more than half empty) and that they had many catering orders and couldn't accommodate my order because it was holiday season (it's December 11th). I felt like I was judged at the door and I don't like the idea of such an establishment in a neighbourhood I actually live in. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food is decent but slightly overpriced for what you get. The decor is well thought out and it's a nice place to chill. The service is quite slow.  I highly recommend the garlic naan here. Definitely try to avoid the rice if you have any standards when it comes to rice.  The waitress insisted that their portions are big and one naan is good for two people. Unless you're a Victoria's Secret model, that's definitely NOT the case."}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent!!  It is a little expensive but very good quality."}
{"text":"I personally feel like Calgary lacks authentic, delicious Indian food. After Nawab came to our neighbourhood, I had to give it a try.   I came with my family and was pleasantly surprised by the modern, yet cultural decor of the restaurant. It was a Saturday evening, but the restaurant was far from busy. There were only a couple of other tables besides us and maybe two servers at the most.   That being said, after we placed our order, the food took quite a while to arrive. We waited for 20min or more just to get our appetizers (samosas and pakoras) and an additional 40mins before we got served our mains.   Simply focusing on the food, the samosas were good. They were filled with well-seasoned peas and potatoes and were freshly deep fried. For mains, I ordered some naan and the lamb vindaloo. The naan was decent: they were chewy and were not crispy (as freshly cooked naan would be), so I was slightly disappointed. As for the lamb vindaloo, although the sauce was well spiced and seasoned, the very few chunks of lamb in the dish were very dense and dry.   I was really looking forward to finally finding a go-to restaurant in Calgary for Indian food, but I think I'll just have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional. It's a bit of a drive for me, coming from the NW of Calgary, but the food is easily worth the drive, and the wait. The staff is always polite, and if you're lucky the chef/owner, Jimmy, will come say hello, as he often does with his guests.  With the best atmosphere, tastiest food, gracious owners/hosts, Nawab is easily the best authentic Indian restaurant in Calgary. Notable: The garlic nann bread is beyond belief."}
{"text":"We used to go here for dinner but NO MORE!!  Last weekend we wanted to grab some Indian food for take out and arrived at 6:00 pm, as we walked in there was a guy walking out with his take-out order.  An older lady walked up to us and asked if we had a reservation.   I replied, \"No\". Before I could say that we wanted take-out she said, \"Would you like a table for two\"? Replying, \"No thanks, we would like take-out\" That's when we got the stink eye and told they cannot take our order because that would slow down the kitchen??  WHERE IS THE LOGIC HERE... If we ate in they would serve us but because it's take-out they declined to serve us.  More importantly- Except for 4 people at one table the place was empty!  This was not the first time but our third time we were declined take-out.  The GOOD out of all this is that we found another Indian restaurant about 2 km away from this snooty place and they do take-out.  The food is better than this place, reasonable priced and good portions.  Never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Our friends took us out to Nawah as I had a craving for Indian food. Unfortunately I wish I had a craving for McDonald's instead as the food was honestly the worst Indian meal ever.   I have had my share of awesome Indian food in Toronto and Nawah was simply uninspiring. Overpriced and bland. No wonder there was only one other group there. You know what they say - you can judge a restaurant by simply looking in at a time when it should be busy. Trust your instincts!  The only thing I liked was the garlic nan and leaving the restaurant. Now that was good.  When I asked the owner about the food and how it differ from Indian food in Toronto, he said cooks in Toronto can't cook. Sorry but this dude should buy a Dummy's Learn to Cook Indian Food book.  Enough said."}
