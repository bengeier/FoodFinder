{"text":"The best fast food seafood place. Scampi and shrimp dinner was the bomb. We got hungry one after noon and found this place on Yelp. Also fast pick up service. 10 mins mean 10mins. Will be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I just left Shark's. The shrimp and fish was delicious . But the fries was dry."}
{"text":"love Sharks. not a fan of seafood so i usually just get a chicken philly. and its delicious. the place is clean and the service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Sharks is the best sea food experience that I have had in Cleveland , I been to many high end restaurants , but sharks has the most delicious shrimp and scampi dinners ! I love this place with a passion it's so worth the 45 min drive from westlake !!!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the Walleye.  It was seasoned to perfection, and plentiful.  The ocean perch was non existent.  No meat inside just fried skin very disappointed."}
{"text":"Never ever again. I have been a faithful customer for the past few years but the crap that I was given last night..$32.00 and 3 small pieces of snapper?? WTF??"}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for a good old fashioned fried fish dinner and decided to give this place a try. In a word, it's solid. Not the best, but very good. The food was cooked perfectly and if you're a fan of seafood you know that's a big deal. Overcooked fish is the worst. But the fish was fresh and not dry or greasy. However it wasn't very flavorful, which was disappointing. And the portions are a little small for the price. But I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Super good I usually get the catfish dinner and it's always good and hot. No long waits but it is best to call ahead."}
{"text":"When I lived on the east side of Cleveland I used to go to sharks about every two weeks. If you are craving some fried seafood this is the place to go. Always impeccably clean with friendly service, this place succeeds in what it's trying to do, which is serve up some tasty sea critters battered and fried. I usually get the scampi combo and a Tahitian treat.  Thanks Sharks. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for some great fried shrimp and I found some great fried lobster tails!!!! I will definitely be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Nita C  Thought this might be a go to Seafood Place In the city coming from Church on Sunday. Place was nice and clean with fast service. I ordered Catfish and Shrimp. Shrimp was ok. Catfish was ok but not crispy. However, everything else was downhill from there. Fries were not crispy and they were plain. Maybe the smaller fries might work better. Coleslaw was ok. Hush puppy was not flavorful and crispy either. There was no cocktail sauce for the shrimp no ketchup for the fries the tartar sauce was practically drenched with mayo and void of flavor nothing but hot sauce which I did not want. No deserts at all. Mac n Cheese did not appear to be freshly prepared but perhaps from the day before.   The hot sauce and tartar sauce did not compliment the experience at all. Would have to be out of options to return. The 3 stars was for price and service."}
{"text":"Owners an asshole plain and simple. Far from fresh. If you want a food borne illness head on over there"}
{"text":"The best spot for authentic Chicago style gyros (y?-r?).  Better than Hotsauce Williams, Whitmores and B&M's."}
{"text":"Great Selection of Food! It was great to be back in Cleveland and experience typical Exemplary Cleveland Dining!"}
{"text":"As a seafood lover and do go to Shark's at least three or four times a month. Never been disappointed about the order's, still hot on my way home and normally gone before my destination !"}
{"text":"I really tried to love this place but it fell short. Ordered a catfish dinner for $8.99 (the following week the price went up to $10.99). The catfish was well seasoned but WAY too salty however, the food was fresh and the fries were good. Went back to try them again except this time, I ordered the now $10.99 catfish and got home and realized they actually gave me tilapia which was pretty mediocre (biased opinion from someone who doesn't like tilapia). The fries and fish were not hot this time and sort of tasted as if they was microwaved. Don't think I'll patronize again unfortunately"}
{"text":"Tried sharks for first time yesterday, got Perch for wife & Whiting for myself fish was excellent! But my Whiting had bones so be careful & the fries could be of a better quality. All & all will be t he go to Fish place for wife & I..."}
{"text":"1/8/2017 8:30pm. Thought I'd give this place a try since some of my friends talked this place up. I ordered the catfish dinner. 3 pieces of fish, coleslaw, 2 pieces of wheat bread, French fries and just 1 hush puppy. It was nothing special. The fish was too salty, the fries were not fresh and were flavorless, hush puppy was dry and the coleslaw was nothing special. I wouldn't go back. Not to mention one of the cashiers was complaining, being loud about how someone told her not to check her phone in front of customers. Yelling \" y'all can take me off of Sunday's forever if you gone act like this over a phone.\" This is why black folks have a bad name. Dinner was $8.99."}
{"text":"I usually don't frequent spots like this but my experience was great so I will definitely be back. Good food, good prices and quick and wonderful customer service. I called in my order and was told 10 or less mins. Walked in the store 10 mins later and was out in under a min. This included the staff greeting, cashing me out and asking if I needed condiments to go along with my food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood seafood spot. Carryout only but it's so good, you probably will eat it in the car before you get to your destination."}
{"text":"Read mixed reviews and was on the fence about this place. I gave it a try and I'm glad I did. They were friendly, the place was way cleaner than the reviews stated and the food was delicious. I had fried perch and shrimp. Well seasoned, good value for the price and lots of variety on their menu. I will certainly be back for more menu items likeother types of fish, shrimp and chicken. I highly recommend this restaurant if you love fish. It doesn't smell fishy so you can tell it's fresh and they fry it firm which I love. This is an example why people need to write about the experience of dealing with the restaurant and not using food reviews to slam a business because the want bigger portions or didn't get enough sauce."}
{"text":"Always fresh, fish always crispy, fries always seasoned...,  This is a TAKE OUT spot. No tables, no restrooms. Local favorite.   Buy it and go!"}
{"text":"When I get food from sharks its either hit or miss..... I usually have to take a toss up guess on if my food is gonna be good or not. I usually get the shrimp and fish combo and either its ok or good enough if you are starving, BUT their fries are nasty!! wet ,oily, greasy ,undone.They have 50 people working trying to make sure your food is fresh but somebody needs to change the oil more often. If you want GREAT seafood FRESHCATCH on 185th ,off of lakeshore is the way  to go!! its a drive but it is worth it. Crispy fresh fish, nice seasoning ,crispy well done fresh cut fries"}
{"text":"BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE SCAMPIE DINNERS...a few of my scampies in my dinner were the texture of mash potatoes. Oh and make sure your food is smoking hot before you leave. My dinners weren't cooked fresh."}
{"text":"Oh man how i miss my Sharks. Now that i live in the bay area i miss the land food choices. Sharks is a mix of seafood deli and other goodies. Located on Lee rd in between cleveland and shaker. The parking is tight maybe 10 spots out front but if nothing just park on the side street. They also have security out front to help with traffic. Sharks is straight take out so your best bet is to call in your order and pick up. This saves you so much time because everything is made fresh . Prices are good too for seafood and the portions are  fairly large. I have almost tried everything on the menu here and i can say i have not had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"I am from Ohio, but have been living in Atlanta Ga for 10 years. I'm currently visiting Cleveland & I have been looking for a good walleye place and found it!!!! A friend recommended Shark's. It was EXACTLY what I have been missing!! My husband also loved the Polish Boy sandwich.  It is a very clean place, and the service was GREAT! The girls are very friendly, and the service was fast. I called my order in & it was ready when I arrived 10 minutes later. Sharks is also VERY affordable!! 2 meals for less than what a fast food place would cost."}
{"text":"The service is great here, 10 mins or less.  Lately I have been ordering wing dinners. In the pass I thought they had the best catfish dinners, but they changed something up. But overall excellent place"}
{"text":"Food was fried perfectly & fast. I ordered carry out. The  young lady who answered the phone was very pleasant as well. Unfortunately the food literally had no taste. We had 2 catfish dinners & 10 piece wings. There was No salt or pepper or seasoning of any kind on the meat. My catfish & chicken tasted the same (bland). My husband loved his but he doused it in hot sauce & tarter sauce. I don't like all the extra on my food. If you like it doused in sauce it'll be fine. If you're a purist like myself keep on going."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious seafood with an inexpensive tab! Try the scampi dinner or the fish and shrimp dinner.. My favorites!"}
{"text":"Fish is tasty and very fresh. but is not fried hard enough for fish dinner. Still recommended as great seafood."}
{"text":"Look at the paper menu because they have fish not listed on the board! The grouper dinner is great!"}
{"text":"We kept driving down Lee Rd and seeing this place called Sharks with a parking lot that was perennially packed. We had no idea what was inside, but figuring that everyone else was in on this place we decided we should be too.   Boy are we glad we did (though our hearts might not be). This place is fried food heaven. The wings are amazing, but they don't sauce them. Just straight up fried chicken wings. All of the fish we've tried is also awesome. This place rocks. Take-out only."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely OUTSTANDING!! I ordered the Shrimp Scampi, Jumbo Shrimp, Catfish and Red Snapper dinners (family). All were fried perfectly. The fries were lightly seasoned and exquisite. I live in Columbus and will have to drive two hours for the privilege of eating this really good food! No place of this genre down here even comes close:)"}
{"text":"They are slow AF and rude.  Food is good but don't believe the 10 min wait time.  More like 40 mins for wings and a sandwich."}
{"text":"So Shark's has a little of everything on their menu. I am a fan of the fried fish(catfish) Red Snapper was good too.  YUM! The chicken wings were also good. Everything has always been fresh and is prepared upon order. They also have a pretty good corned beef sandwich but given the number of excellent Jewish delis in Cleveland, that is not why I would go to Shark's. The portions are filling and the sides are not bad. The place is efficient and clean."}
{"text":"The \"Scampi Combo\" (cajun-style) at this place is perhaps my absolute favorite meal on God's green earth. That is saying a whole lot.  And really, this is all you need to know.  But I love this carryout, so I will go further.  If it is seafood you want and you are in Cleveland, do not spend $100 on dinner at Blue Point; do NOT waste your money at the fancy Pier W. No Mitchell's or McCormick and Scmicks nor Red Lobster.  Spend your 20 dollar bill at Sharks and fall in love with their delicious fried Orange Roughy, Red Snapper, perfectly fried shrimp, spectacular jumbo shrimp scampi or any number of other FRSH seafood options on their list.  You order a fish dinner, you SEE them select your fish from the fresh case and prepare it.  Oh, and the bonus hush puppies. Never cared for those until Sharks.  Hurry, please.  In addition to the honestly spectacular food, Sharks is sparkling CLEAN. Pristine. Well-run. It is worth a drive across town. And it is worth going out of your way if you are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Awesome place great food and owner is the sweetest man. The food is always fresh. I come from Miami to visit this place."}
{"text":"Great seafood. Inl always  get the shrimp dinner or the orange roughy fish.  It's always crispy and fresh. I love there seafood seasoning that they use. Its awesome. Cole slaw mind of bland. Not to pricey either for a local seafood joint."}
{"text":"Fried seafood doesn't get any better than this. I live in D.C. but my grandparents live in Cleveland and what better reason to come visit dear ole granny? SHARKS!   The service is great - super friendly folks.  There's a T.V. so you can sit and watch the game while you wait (carry-out, only folks).   I always get the fried jumbo shrimp with a different side ... I'll be honest, the fries are almost always soaky due to the fried seafood inside.  Sides include green beans, mac and cheese, etc.   The fried fish is good too but I highly recommend the jumbo shrimp! It's about 11.99 for 1/2 pound of shrimp and a side.   Thanks Shark for always being there for me!"}
{"text":"MMMMM FRIED SEAFOOD!  I found this place with my gf one day when we were starving and had nowhere to go for food. We went there and saw a cop standing by the door. We were so amused by that, thinking that we are very well protected. I have tried a number of things from that place. I especially liked the scampi dinner. The garlic shrimp was delicious beyond description. The fried shrimp was still very good. However, they only give you four for each kind. The rest of the food was just fries and coleslaw. I didn't like their fries - it was very dried. The also give you two little containers with melted butter and spicy ketchup usually or chilli sauce. I've also tried fish dinner with different kinds of fish fried. I would recommend the red snapper and the sea bass. I haven't tried the lobsters because the lobsters on display didn't seem that fresh. You can also call in ahead of time and pick up your order later, becasue it does take them 10 min to prepare and get the food to you. Overall, a great place to go if you are feeling greasy and fishy!"}
{"text":"I got the catfish dinner, which I really enjoyed. Crispy batter and moist fish inside. The portions were large considering it was only $8. I'm not sure what some of these people are talking about saying the fish and fries were bland. Mine had some sort of seasoning visibly sprinkled on it very liberally, almost too much.  A few minor complaints: 1. The waiting area here is quite large, not sure why they don't put in a couple tables or a counter. Beats eating in the car like we had to do. 2. The dinners say they come with hush puppies. Should say hush puppy. Yeah, both of ours only had 1 very small one. Kind of dumbfounded by that decision. 3. Counter staff was kind of stand-offish. I wouldn't say rude, but you could tell they were annoyed to be there."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place heard so many mix reviews. I tryed it I order the bucket of perch Very Flavorful Fresh and hot. The wait was not long at all came in and place my order received it in about 15 minutes or less. The bucket carrying with Fries coleslaw hot sauce and tartar sause. Will have it again and again"}
