{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by our recent experience at Lopez. It is a locally owned vibrant neighborhood spot with a great patio so we gave it another chance. The food used to be fantastic, but of late it had been mediocre to downright bad. However, this last visit the food was, dare I say, good. We had the special burrito which was delicious, and the shrimp tacos were spicy and flavorful. We did not order guacamole, it is SO BAD there it just makes me angry. Do they buy it prepared or make it in the morning and load it up with chemicals? It has been such a huge disappointment that we avoided it. Also, I don't know why people like the margaritas, they taste like the bottled stuff from the grocery store. In a restaurant of that caliber I expect some fresh tasting lime juice in there. Bottom line- GO! Enjoy the patio, the indoor ambience, the fabulous service. Be judicious in what you order, and you will have a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Lopez's menu begins with an interesting claim to fame. Apparently, when they were opening, they were helped out by Rick Bayless.  I loved Bayless' Topolobampo, his upscale place in Chicago, so I was looking forward to my meal here:  Food: Started with the blue cheese and sage guacamole to accompany the obligatory chips and (rather bland) salsa. The blue cheese really went well with the Guacamole, but overall it was too small to justify an $8 price. Also, at that point you'd think I'd get a bit more chips then the small bags of them, or at that price, god forbid, some of their flour chips (but no, those would be $5 extra). I guess they refill the tortilla chips every so often, but it just made the whole appetizer feel like a ripoff.  Went with the pulled pork burrito for my entree. This was alright, with pulled pork and onions on the inside and some black beans on top. Unfortunately, they decided to drown the burrito in this tomatillo sauce. It was fine, but if I wanted a completely covered burrito, I would have ordered an enchilada, and I didn't, so this was another annoyance. Perhaps I'm being overly picky here, but if they were going to go for the \"whole dish\" vibe here by adding the sauce, the flavor should have been knockout and it wasn't.   Now, just to clarify. I know that both of these could have been avoided by ordering something that might have been more to my liking. They weren't my first choice; we wanted to go with the tamale for an appetizer and I had picked out the Ahi Tacos for an entree, but they were out of both (as well as something else I'm forgetting). Just seemed sloppy.  Drinks: Had a Mojito, it was nice and minty, although the ice should have been a bit more crushed. They have Dos Equis on tap, so that's a plus.  Service: As a few of the other reviewers have said, they do seem to have a more attractive staff, so it was a very pleasant dinner on the eyes. Our particular waitress was very friendly, although she did recommend one of the dishes that they didn't have, so that was a bit ditzy. Overall, though, her demeanor  was great and it's definitely possible to say she was the highlight of the meal.  I'd go back, and would be eager to try a few other things, but they could learn a few things from Topolo / Bayless and focus on the small stuff, it definitely kept our meal from being a four star experience"}
{"text":"\"Lopez? More like Blowpez!\" BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Oh baby, Review of the Day here I come. So this place has three-star quality food at five-star quality prices. I'm really not sure how that math translates into a two-star rating, but that is what my TI-83 graphing calculator comes up with when I plug in the numbers. Although, to be fair, I did not double check my math, so I will do that now.  (Pulls out calculator, types '80085', giggles uncontrollably)  Yep, two stars. Moving along, Lopez isn't really a bad place per se. It's very nice inside and the food is certainly acceptable. It's just overpriced. You're much better off going to Momocho if you're looking for some fancy-pants Mexican joint to really wow your Taco Bell-lovin' friends with."}
{"text":"My girl and I always go for mexican food when we are undecided so we went to Lopez since its close to our new place. To cut right to the chase it was not nearly worth the price. When I can go to some hole in the wall mexican joint that pops up and closes in a month for half the price I need to be wowed when I'm paying 9$ for guacamole. My martini was good, not saying much since I'm a sucker for anything with alchohol in it. The small bag of chips and bland salsa was very dissapointing. I decided on the pork burrito, with pulled pork, cracklins, and tips. It was a large serving and the quality of product was great but again, missing flavor.   The jalapeno guda grits were the only notable portion of my meal. Bomb!  But I was so dissapointed I didn't even get drunk and try to speak seductive spanish to my girlfriend like I always do. I may go back once more, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"We have been to Lopez at least 25 times and my cousin is the daughter-in-law of the owner (I also attended their rehearsal dinner here). We absolutely love the food and atmosphere. Our only issue is the manager. On every occasion we have dined in, we see him visit every table to check on guests. He has never once visited our table or checked in with us. I believe it is because we look very young- but this sort of bias against patrons is not a good look, especially when we have been loyal customers for many years. It's almost a game we play now- will the manager visit our table? Every time the answer is no.  Keith Clapacs"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner tonight. Our outstanding server Taylor ,recommended the caesar salad and shrimp tacos and they were the best this foodie has ever had! The steak fahitas were perfect. To top things the manager/owner? Stopped by the table to insure we were enjoying our meal. We will be back, best Mexican fresh, made to order food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"We went once, and that was once too many. I don't mind the wasted money, or the pollution done to my mouth. A good margarita could have cured that. But bad drinks are also part of their shtick. No, what bothers me the most was the wasted time. If I could have that back, I'd give them a second star just to be civil.   You'd have more chance of getting food that was authentically south western or mexican at a Long John Silvers. When they finally let the food police out, this place will get cited for nasty fraud."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays. All I can say is HALF PRICED TEQUILA AND LOBSTER EMPANADAS!!!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite restaurants to eat at. I am never disappointed. Their pineapple mojito-is sooooo good. I usually get the seafood enchiladas and they are always packed with lobster. The portions are generous. The staff looks happy and really know their stuff about the menu. Most of the staff has been there for years. This place is great to your meet friends or to take a date."}
{"text":"Lopez is not your average TexMex restaurant. They have thoughtfully crafted, refined, modern dishes. I do recommend you check out the menu before visiting, because it may not satisfy everyone's typical craving for Mexican food. Service is excellent, the staff are friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately, the price is a little steep compared to other comparable Mexican restaurants I've visited. That being said, food is high quality and worth a try. I was also impressed by the wide selection of tequila and margaritas."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican restaurant!  We found it neat that Rick Bayless got his start here!!   Grits were amazing, as well as the fajitas!   Love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Lopez for the first time last night and I will not go back. I am giving two stars rather than one, only because our waiter was great. It was the food and prices that were horrible. First off, the menu is very confusing. One taco costs between 7 and 9 dollars and they require you order atleast two tacos. I was expecting the tacos to be amazing because of the price. They were a disappointment. The flavors were boring, they did not taste fresh, and although I was still hungry, I did not even finish my second taco because of its lackluster taste. The drinks we ordered were decent but the chips were stale. This may be aggressive, but the friend I went with and I decided that taco bell would have been better."}
{"text":"Overrated! We could not wait to try Lopez because of their recent margarita contest with Momocho... Margaritas were all sour mix, salsa was bland, food had no flavor and covered with cheese, chips seemed like out of a bag..... The price was mid-high but the quality was low chain restaurant.  We are sticking to Tremont, Ohio city and downtown for good eats."}
{"text":"I have eaten at lopez for years.  It consistanly is excelent and is always coming up with the most unusual dishes.  I had the scalops with the refried beans and the grits are to die for.  If you have not eaten there for a while or have never you really need too.  Fantastic and the staf could not be better.  Thank you and a great job for many years."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are giving this place 5 stars it was delicious and totally worth every penny... Let me explain more      The quality of the food was great! Full of flavor, I could taste the garlic, cayenne, salt, pepper all in equal parts not overpowering at all. The food here is not like your typical Mexican/Latino fare style food- greasy, salty, makes you feel like blah after you eat it. This is what I refer to as higher end Mexican/Latino style meals. ++++ Their happy hour is 4-9 pm ! WHAT A DEAL! MARGS WERE HALF OFF!   The Price- My guest and I ordered two burritos the SW Ruben and The Bleu Rodeo and they were each roughly $16-17 with cornmeal grits & sw coleslaw   Service- Excellent, I asked for a margaritta with my dinner and they actually remembered and asked if I wanted one! Plus they were promt with filling our drinks, helpful in explaining their opinion of best menu items and the manager came around and inquired about the quality of our meal. Last, they box your meals for you and not hand you a box like you may have at your typical family style mexican resturaunts."}
{"text":"More than your typical really good Mexican restaurant.  The house hot yellow sauce is really good. I really considered trying to steal the bottle."}
{"text":"So dissapointed! I grew up in Shaker Hts and remember when this place was Lopez & Gonzales. Back in the neighborhood today to catch an 11am Harry Potter screening at Cedar Lee left a perfect reason for my Mother and I to stop by for brunch afterwards.  We were greeted at the door by a friendly backwaiter and then a friendly hostess who showed us to a table and was accommodating when we asked to switch to a booth. Beside us, there were four other two top tables and a bar patron when we arrived. The hostess also dropped our waters immediately. We then waited a full ten minutes for the server to greet our table; ten minutes we sat and watched her walk past us to check on the guys sitting next to us as well as the three other tables several times and fumble at the micros station which was facing our table. It was obvious she was the only server, but as stated before, we were the fifth table in the restaurant and every other table already had plates. The server finally took our drink order. The server was friendly, obviously somehow overwhelmed by 5 tables, a concept that I as a former server cannot even wrap my head around, but I digress. We expected her to stop by and ask if we wanted an appetizer or would like to place our order since we had already waited so long just to place a drink order, she did not. Another 10 minutes floated by, so we are now 20 minutes in sitting at a table staring at our waters.  The final straw was at about 25 minutes when the guys next to us placed an order for a second round of bloody mary's, and received them before we received our first round OR were asked if we would like to place any food order of any kind. As we stood up to leave, the server told us our drinks were up, but honestly by then it was way too late. It is unacceptable to take 10 minutes to greet a table, then not even deliver said drink or take an app order within the subsequent 10 minutes. So we sat in that restaurant for 25 minutes and never even got our first round. I still gave two stars because the menu does look really tastey, and despite the slothy service, the staff we encountered were friendly and warm. I will adjust review if we take a chance trying to come back again and are given reasonable service.  *note upon reading some of the other reviews I see that apparently we were supposed to be offered complimentary chips and salsa. We were never even offered that. So review is dropping to 1 star. Consistency lacking as well*"}
{"text":"First and foremost, if you're going here, expect to spend some money.  With that said, you really should. At least once. The food is really wonderful and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating. I was on my way to a movie that began an hour from the time we sat down and we told our waitress right off the bat. Our appetizer was out in about ten minutes - a fantastic calamari dish that was very unique. It was mixed with greens and grapefruit (and possibly oranges or some other citrus fruit) and a jalapeno jelly that was delicious. Our meal was then out less then ten minutes after that - both dishes were extremely large and extremely delightful. The bill ended up being nearly $50 for the entire meal, which is steep, but it was certainly worth it."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food... and this is by far the closest non-burrito joint to where I live. Unfortunately, my overall impression was that it was way overpriced. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cheapskate (anymore). I'm happy to drop $80-100 on good food and drink with my wife every couple weeks.... But three \"jumbo\" margaritas cost freakin' $30! Even that would be okay if they were strong... Or fantastic. But if my wife can drink 2 jumbo margaritas and not ask me to drive home, they ain't strong. And I've made better concoctions myself.  As for the food... It's just good. Not great. I've had the same size and quality pulled pork burrito at trashy airport cantinas for half the price. My wife's lobster enchiladas were a step above average... but again... not enough of a step above for the price we paid.  Damn. I really do sound like a cheapskate. It's just that I'd rather have spent the same amount of money at Anatolia or Bodega or... Freakin' Dewey's pizza. Ah well."}
{"text":"Seems people love or hate this place.  I love it.  Food is always consistent; I have tried and enjoyed much of the menu (minus seafood options) but my hands down favorite is the Mezcal Chicken. so yummy.  what ever is in that red pepper marmalade!.  It comes with grilled asparagus; now I HATE asparagus but I LOVE these asparagus no idea why but I can't get enough of them.  Guac is superb and a personal favorite drink is the pomegrante margarita.  YUM!"}
{"text":"For months my boyfriend had been talking about getting a bacon manhattan from Lopez and last Thursday we finally took the plunge.  Once inside, you instantly feel as if you've transported to a restaurant in the heart of Mexico.  The decor and music is very inviting and definitely adds to the overall vibe and dining experience.  We chose to eat on the patio and if the weather is nice I would highly recommend you sit there.  We started with drinks - margaritas for the boyfriend and his roommate (they stopped making the bacon manhattan - go figure!  However, they'll be back in September) and a mojito for me.  The drinks were EXCELLENT but pricey, so if you're looking to have a boozy night then this isn't a very cost effective option.  For an appetizer we got the iron chef guacamole -  avocado, blue cheese and bacon.  Absolutely delicious - no wonder why is't Michael Symon's favorite!  For dinner the boys got nachos and al pastor tacos, which were both excellent.  I, on the other hand, stuck to the guac and mojitos.    Overall, the food and drinks were wonderful, but the serving sizes were pretty darn small for the prices."}
{"text":"My first time at Lopez was phenomenal!  Sandy, our server,  was amazing in guiding our dinning experience.  From the exact description and taste of our 1/2 off margarita pitcher (6 glasses) to the precise flavor profile of each entrée we inquiried about.  Each dish is assembled with both taste and visual presentation in mind.  This place is, by far, 5 stars. An outstanding experience!!!"}
{"text":"It's too bad that the food and service are so underwhelming, because the ambiance (especially on the patio) is 4-5 stars.  For Cleveland, the food and drinks are overpriced.  The complimentary chips and salsa would be fine from a Mexican chain restaurant but are disappointing in this context.  During one visit I had the lobster tacos and the next time I had the bison burger.  The tacos were unmemorable and unfulfilling.  The burger was better but I've paid half as much for a higher quality, more interesting product at Symon's B-Spot.  Sweet potato fries had good flavor but were the texture of shoestrings.  We had the same server during both visits-- he was difficult to flag down when we wanted water refills or to place our food order, and he forgot our drink order-- it wasn't horrible service, but the guy was kind of flaky and it was painful to tip for this on such an overpriced meal.  I'd rather go to Los Habaneros in Shaker, which lacks the ambiance but at least is priced appropriately."}
{"text":"I can never decide if I like Lopez or not.  The food is decent, but not for the price.  Well, maybe when I was in college.  Now it does not bother me.  If you want a cool atmosphere and a ton of different margarita flavors, then this may be the place for you.  Pretty much the only reason I ever come here is for the Margaritas and/or happy hour..   Lots of tequila is to be had at Lopez.  I would say Lopez is good for smaller groups because there are usually a ton of people there, and the tables are pretty close together."}
{"text":"Only went to Lopez to introduce my young charge to fried ice cream...but dang did they help my case! He's convinced, and I'm convinced that I'd eat here next time I'm in northeast Ohio...and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food at Lopez is good, but it's not so spectacular to warrant the price.  The drinks (including margaritas) are expensive, and the margaritas aren't really that great.  However, if you go Sunday through Friday between 5-7 p.m., all the drinks with tequila (including margaritas!) are 50% off.  The fish tacos are a good bet, and the salads (oddly) are quite good, since they fry up some cheese to throw on there. Yum.  I also suggest the lobster enchiladas; they throw in shrimp and finish things with pretty good cheese and chipotle crema."}
{"text":"Last ate at lopez about a month ago.  No matter how many times I give this place a chance, I leave disappointed.  Way over priced with a cheap/kitschy esthetic.  It looks like you should be getting a $5 burrito, premade, coming out pulled directly from the reheat oven.  And that's what you get except 1) It's a plate of slop 2) It costs $20.  But what about the drinks - basically SYSCO generic margarita mix, splash of booze and $10 a pop.  Consider yourself warned.  This place is a total con."}
{"text":"The food at Lopez was much better than it was described on the menu.  After extensively reviewing a menu where every description seemed weird or not tasty, I finally decided on two tacos - the shrimp and a fried fish taco, and on the recommendation of a friend, I ordered the corn pudding on the side.  It was fantastic!!! The fish was fresh and hot and the sauce was spicy and delicious.  The corn pudding was more like a jalapeno corn bread, and I loved that as well.  One star off for not having complimentary valet parking - it was really tacky to charge for parking in your own lot, and for not moving our party inside off the patio when it started to rain.  I mean, come on!!  ** Also, there is a goat cheese queso sounding dish under the appetizer portion - it is NOT like regular queso! Just as a heads up."}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas, the last thing I think I wanted in Cleveland was Mexican food, but the ambience was welcoming, the menu looked interesting... now I think they should open a branch in Houston!  The menu isn't exactly \"fusion\", but it's a bright take on southwestern flavors, with familiar ingredients prepared in fresh, unique ways. As I was dining alone I unfortunately couldn't taste a lot, but the chips were warm, the salsa was fresh, the shrimp with jalapeno cheese grits was delicious, and the grilled Caesar salad with crispy croutons amazing.  They have a lovely patio with trees. Inside looked cozy enough to brave a Cleveland winter. Good job all around."}
{"text":"If you are in Cleveland from out of town...especially LA, Texas, or the southwest, you probably shouldn't bother eating here.  You will have far too biased an opinion on what Mexican inspired food should taste like.   Also, if you've only eaten at Mexican places where the name starts with \"El\" and contains the name of a resort town in Mexico, you also should steer clear- you can't get a \"combo plate\" of sodium for $5.99.  For those who have continued to read, it truly has great Mexican inspired dishes.  From flank steak to fish tacos to creative guacamole, it's good stuff and made from scratch.  It's very similar to food you'd get at an actual restaurant in Mexico, rather than the usual tex-mex you get in a American strip mall. So it is pricier than Taco Bell...that seems to bother some reviewers.  Also, this place is on the side of town that's full of cheap skates and college kids.  So price effects their taste buds.    It's a good setting with good service and great food- I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Upon moving to Cleveland Heights from New Orleans and Charleston, SC, my fiancé and I were eager to try out our new neighborhood restaurants, which included Lopez. We are huge foodies with a thing for Tex-Mex, and self-proclaimed guacamole connoisseurs. Lopez seemed like a great fit.  Not so. First, the highlights: Great outdoor dining area, special cocktails were above par (try the grapefruit smash), chunky/fresh salsa and decent chips. Table service was much better than our experience with the hostess on both visits (thank goodness).  And for the 2 stars:  the hostess was very snobby and rude, looking my fiance and i up and down upon entry and then acted like we were interrupting her texting time. The indoor dining area is very loud . The place is also waaaayyy over-priced for the quality of food served (their other locations include Palm Beach and Beverly Hills...I guess people don't mind paying too much for blah food there, but this place would never make it in the south). The guacamole is just okay, it could be much better with a less pungent onion. The lobster taco is simply too butter-soaked and salty (and that means a lot coming from a New Orleanian). Reduce the butter and you might be able to taste the lobster you're paying for. We also tried the carnitas and tuna tacos. The tuna was also just \"okay\".. Carnitas taco was terrible. The meat was dry and somewhat chewy, and the sauce flavoring was used to mask this shortcoming. Yuck! My fiancé tried the brisket entree during the first of our 2 visits to Lopez. He gave the brisket a 6/10, but also said it was way over priced for the quality. The margarita was very disappointing. You'd think a \"tequila bar\" would know better than to use the despicable green margarita mix. We definitely expected fresher margs.  After our 2nd visit, we have decided to look elsewhere, even if it means having to drive across town for our guacamole and margarita fix.  We wouldn't recommend this place, lots of hype with nothing to back it up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The food at Lopez seems to get progressively less interesting and less inspiring as the years go on.  It seems like their average chef works there for only two years or so and with each new chef; their food gets more and more mediocre.  Lopez put Mexican fusion on the map for Cleveland's East Side and now all it represents is a place that you can get a nice margarita or two and have to wait a long time to get it. Their staff can be a bit dim. We once got served our entrees 25 seconds after our appetizers arrived.  I refused to have them pile up our table with everything. Naturally, 13 minutes later they served us the same entrees that I initially refused.  I hate food heated by lamps and yes, it made their mediocre food taste even worse.  Lobster enchiladas (which also used to be much better) turned to mush!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, all have been good except this last visit. This last time we decided to sit at the bar to order margaritas and some appetizers. Both bartenders were not very friendly, barely said a few words to us. Ordered a few tacos and guacamole. Please use SALT in the guacamole. It was so bland and barely edible."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night for happy hour. The tequila selection was impressive, and half price margaritas on Tues and Thurs nights are good, but the food seemed mediocre to me. The food selections were a mix of American/Mexican/Tex-Mex fare (such as the Kobe burger with chipotle mayo).   Would go back for half price margaritas, but would not go back to eat."}
{"text":"i guess thursday is the night to go to lopez.  and i know in the summer the place is hopping with their outdoor seating.  but with all the people i had always seen coming and going from the place, i figured i'd wait for the hype to die down and check it out whenever.  the margaritas are pretty darn good.  you can mix and match all different flavors.  we did pomegranite and peach.  apparently not a popular option, but it was yums to me.  and they have a lot of tequila.  enough to conquer the bad guy from three amigos.    yeah. that would have been funnier had i actually remembered Dude's name.  oh well.  it's been awhile since i saw it.  the place itself is trendy.  and i swear they must bio-engineer their wait staff, because there wasn't  a single unattractive person on the staff.  pretty people.  the type of pretty people you gasp and and say \"wow.  they're pretty\".  tequila and pretty people aside, the food's not bad.  the soup of the day was tomato and white bean with chorizo.  crap on toast it's good.  my friends go crazy for their seafood stuff, but i stick with the veggies or the chicken.  the chicken enchiladas were massive.  you know the phrase burritos bigger than your head?  well, these enchiladas were bigger than your head, your mom's head, and the horse she rode in on.  ...in the three amigos."}
{"text":"This is NOT a vegan friendly place. I was hoping to be able to substitute a few ancho green beans for the smoked gouda in the Jardin Qesadilla, in order to make the plate vegan. Our server was emphatic, \"We can't do that!\", but assured me that he could just leave off the cheese. My reaction was \"You mean you don't want to do that!\" yet you're more than willing to have me pay for, yet not eat, one of the more, if not the most, expensive ingredient in the dish. Hopefully, Lopez will come around someday."}
{"text":"Before I touch on food, I have to recognize Lopez for excelling at a more noble dining pursuit.  That would be serving tequila.  Lopez really has one of the more comprehensive tequila menus I've ever come across and certainly the most I've seen in Cleveland.  I'd definitely recommend trying a flight of tequilas sometime.  Since a good tequila is the key stone in any good margarita, Lopez serves up an excellent one here.  Fortunately for me I can walk home from here.  Others may not have that luxury, so I'd recommend that they invite at least one friend who doesn't enjoy partaking of fine libations and slap them with DD duty.  Oh yeah, concerning the food. This isn't a Mexican restaurant, so if you have your hopes set on high for authentic Mexican, keep looking.  It's more of a modern-southwest-fusionish menu. While I really love the enchiladas here, I'm also a huge fan of their crab cakes.  The service is alright here, nothing to write home about, but I've never had a bad experience either."}
{"text":"Not Mexican food! Most boring burrito and tacos ever. Chipotle does a better job. So sad that the burrito was also the most expensive, 17 dollars. I think their favorite spice is water. The carnitas seemed boiled. Maybe they should call their burrito a wrap to avoid confusion with real Mexican food? My girlfriend wanted to cry, she was born in San Francisco, and our favorite tacos came from a truck on East 14th in Oakland California. She said the food from Lopez tasted like how a wet dog smells.     I give them two stars, because they played awesome music the whole time, such as Pixies, Bowie, Radiohead, and our server was good, and made reasonable excuses for the food, like it's SouthWest, not Mexican. And the atmosphere was nice, we sat outside, friendly staff that works very hard."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I been there once by myself and it you could tell that they do everything they can to make you have the best experience.   First off the service was great, the girl I had did everything on time, she remembered my order to the exact point. Although she made a mistake, you can tell she did absolutely everything in her power to fix it and it was great.  Not only that, the food was amazing too. Words can not explain how good the food was, I'm telling you, you should go here with your family."}
{"text":"Oh hey there, Lopez, stepping it up!   I can't bring myself to upgrade to a 4, though I'm close based on happy hour alone - yes, the prices are great, but the food and drinks were amazing too!   A friend and I decided to mix things up and go to happy hour here instead of our usual haunts and we were wowed by the margaritas we got! Our server made some suggestions that we followed and they were so good! We had the pineapple with a spicy rim and it was perfect, then we went for cactus with a little spice as well and it was delicious!   The food was also amazing. The goat cheese fundido was probably all we needed. It was cheesy and delicious and the chips and salsa were tasty as well. We each got a brisket taco, too, and while my taco was STUFFED with beef, it was a little dry. I would have been happy with less beef, with a little more moisture or sauce or something.  I'll definitely be back for some margaritas and queso. Soon."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly staff, easy to get to and the valet is a really nice touch. Everything is fresh, delicious, and really great.   Two words: Lobster. Tacos.   Great bar area for small groups, but lots of space for parties as well. Patio is beautiful. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Lopez was a frequent stop on my dining tour when I lived in the Heights. To be fair, I have not been to Lopez in over a year. However, I have some very fond memories of this Latin hot spot. I love the decor and ambiance. The food always took back seat to the Tequila drinks and fun atmosphere. If you know the down and dirty Cleveland foodie drama, then you know Momocho has the better menu and chef. That being said, I still always have a great time at Lopez.   One of my favorite memories: purposefully ordering the most expensive entre on the menu just to watch my gentleman caller squirm. Mwahahahahaha.   Ahh...the sweet memories of half priced tequila Thursdays."}
{"text":"A little expensive but I can count on GREAT FOOD and my drinks will be good. Period. Good atmosphere, great, trendy area of town.  Only complaint would be parking and the fact that they use valet parking to get a spot there. Kinda silly if you ask me."}
{"text":"I would give Lopez zero stars if that was an option. I have never in my life had an experience at a restaurant like this! We had high hopes when we got there and we were quickly seated outside on their very cute patio. We were excited for half price margaritas and when we ordered, the waitress told us the first few we tried to order are not half price. Only their 3 house margaritas are half price, the other 20+ on the menu are not. Oh well, they were still good. We started with shrimp n grits which was AMAZING. I could eat it every day! Then out entrees were brought out and it all went downhill. I ordered a special - the soft-shell crab burrito and my boyfriend got the steak fajitas, cooked medium well. His steak was red and bleeding in the middle - obviously not medium well - and CHEWY. When I say chewy, I mean you could not bite through the steak in the fajita wrap. Not only was it a terrible cut of meat, it was laced with fat and not cooked to order.  My burrito was a nightmare! The presentation was beautiful but that was it. They deep fried the crab, with the shell and waste inside of it. So when I bit into the burrito, I also couldn't bite through it because the soft shell was still on it. I opened it up and tried to take the shell off (opening a burrito and eating it with a fork defeats the point of ordering a burrito...) and I found all of the joints and crab waste inside. It looked as if they just put the crab in the fryer and wrapped it up, didn't shell it or clean it. How can you do that in a burrito??? Neither one of us ate our dinner. We waited well over 20 minutes for our waitress to come back and check on us and we told her out problems. She apologized and then said she would get us something else. We explained that we did not have time as we had to be somewhere else. She then said I wish you would have told me sooner so I could have brought you something else. I explained that we had been waiting for her because she did not check on us once we were brought our entrees. She apologized and said she would get the manager and took our plates away. She came back by herself and said the manager would like to offer us a free dessert. I explained that we do not want dessert because we did not eat dinner and also we do not have time, so she said she would bring the check then (my burrito was $20 and his steak was $19). I informed her that we could not even eat our meals so I was not happy about paying for them. She again said she would get the manager. 5-10 minutes later the manager came out and said I saw your plates, you ate half of it, so you can have a free dessert. We explained that we each had a bite and it was terrible, we did not want or have time for dessert and we did not want to pay for food we could not and did not eat. He then started telling me that soft shell crabs have no shell at all so it's impossible that I had any shell because the crabs \"walk out of their shell completely.\" The waitress took our plates so I could not prove to him their was crab poop and shell in my burrito. He continued to argue with us and made a scene on the patio. We were so embarrassed!! He lectured us about how great their kitchen is and they don't make mistakes and their food is great. He never apologized and in the end he said - I'll just take care of your whole bill - and scurried way. We often dine at more expensive restaurants and have no problem paying good money for our food, but this was ridiculous. I have never had someone argue with us like that and I am sure he went inside and yelled at the waitress too even though none of this was her fault. Needless to say, we will NEVER go back, and I will actively let everyone we know to also NEVER go there."}
{"text":"The decor was cool inside and the service was very good. Everyone was very friendly. But honestly that was the highlight of the experience. I went in with a few buddies and we ordered the steak and enchiladas and I think they were $21. Corn fritter special $8 and the guacamole$9 or so.  All of our enchiladas were very poor. The steak was very chewy and tough to eat. One of my enchiladas actually had no steak in it. My buddies agreed. The corn fritters were very small. The guacamole chips and salsa were good tho.  We each had a drink as well. With tip our check was around $130."}
{"text":"Know what really creases me?  When a restaurant removes a less-than-positive review from its Yelp listing.  Who's to blame....the restaurant or Yelp?  I wrote 2 previous reviews of Lopez...one glowing (which is magically still posted) and one not-so-glowing (one that was removed) on a subsequent visit when I said their service had slipped and their guacamole was served very cold and clearly wasn't freshly prepared.  Well guess what?  Tonight was the SAME experience.  Salsa arrived at the table STONE COLD...I mean, straight out of a cold refrigerator.  Come on...get the food temperatures right.  It sets the tone for the rest of the meal.  So I wasn't surprised when the masa arrived with a flaming hot corn masa with super cold cheese atop it.  So, someone needs to get a handle on the food details.  The chicken in my fajitas was rubbery.  However, the carnitas were good.  When the server cleared our plates he dropped the fork on the top of my foot.  Accidents do happen but still... This place used to be SO GREAT about 2-3 years ago, and it has slipped tremendously.  I think they must have gotten a new manager over that time period.  There is some gray-haired due who insists on serving all the food.  Perhaps it is him.  And yes, we were told when we sat down that they are NOT a Mexican restaurant but rather a South American restaurant.  Tell you what Lopez...how about you work on your food execution before you have the balls to tell me how to classify your cuisine.  Gee, I wonder how long this review will stay posted...in the meantime I will be eating at Momocho for upscale Mex and Villa y Zapata for authentic Mex."}
{"text":"The parking attendant was quite personable and responsible. He was the best employee we encountered during our dinner. Our food was good, not great, but certainly good. Our server was not. Not only was she remarkably innatentive, but when she neglected to bring us items we had ordered she never acknowledged her mistake or apologized. We were hosting friends for dinner and my husband had to get up three times to ask the manager, or maybe owner, for our appetizer, and both rounds of drinks that we had ordered from the server. The second round of drinks was ordered well before the entrees were served and finally when everyone was half way through their meals, my husband got up and hunted down the drinks. The restaurant was just over half full, so we can't blame the bad service on a busy night. All in all it was very disappointing. We have been going to Lopez since it was at its old location \"Lopez y Gonzoles\" The service has gotten progressively worse. Don't know if we'll go again. Kind of sad."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and me and my wife like to check out places in the neighborhood. Been there once. Pricey. Just ok food. Not friendly. Very good cocktails."}
{"text":"So I thought this place was just okay. The food didn't wow me.  I was told amazing things.  The guacamole with the goat cheese was def good. We did the trio. The lobster guac, I wasn't too impressed with. I ordered the fish as the main entree! Now that was pretty good. No room for dessert but the watermelon margarita may have been my favorite of the whole dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the management and service are AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!  If you advertise 1/2 price margaritas 'til 7pm, honor that for customers who walk in at 6:50 even if waitstaff is out of it and didn't place the order 'til 7:02.  Staff is untrained and management is rude, petty.  I'm not just basing this on the margarita incident but on many prior visits.  The food alone (and nostalgia) has brought me back but I'm afraid not again."}
{"text":"Short:   All food was reheated, overdone and overpriced!! I guess drinks only here.  Long:   Just ate here for the first time after hearing many recommendations.  NOT IMPRESSED and very OVERPRICED!!!!  $70 for re-heated food, both appetizer and entrees. Asked the waitress if the brisket was smoked in house and was told yes. What wasn't told was that it would be reheated and tough.  The lobster taco was cold and not warm and did not melt in mouth. Lastly we ordered the calamari and within 3 minutes it had been brought out, awesome, or so we thought. The calamari was extremely chewy and obviously pre-made. Long story short save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wish would be no star at all. As an expert in Great Mexican food ( born and raised in Mexico with great cooks all my life), this restaurant is a JOKE, chefs try so hard, the fusions are horrendous, tortillas like card board ( they do not pay attention to how to warm them , they are one of most important elements in a Mexican meal). Prices are unjust, it's seriously a restaurant for mediocre palates....Paladares Mediocres......seriously worst restaurant in Cleveland..........I Love good Mexican/American food, but this restaurant regardless of its \"genre\" , No , No........................Best Cuisine or any art-form is all about Simplicity, yet sophistication......wakala!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Lopez, high quality Southwest fare which is borderline pricey but you get what you pay for!  A group of 4 just left their brunch and it was so good! I had the lobster benedicto and it was freaking amazing!  The rest of the group had the shrimp and grits, brisket hash and another got the lobster. All reasonably price for the good amount and quality of the food. There were huge chunks of lobster and pork belly in mine and it was $14 which to me is worth it. They also had brunch cocktails- 4 or 5 bloody Mary's and mimosas which we had and were great as well. Also it's pretty new so we wondered in at noon on a Sunday and had no problem getting a table. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I a frequent guests but have never taken the time to write a review.  Our meal last night was terrific!  I had two delicious spicy shrimp tacos filled with large perfectly cooked shrimp, and a side of asparagus, which was a very nice option.  My wife also had tacos, a lobster filled one, and a mushroom taco that were great.. Our server, though busy, worked hard to keep us pleased, and as always the chips and salsa were kept replenished on our table.  I thought it was time to say thanks and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Won't be rushing back. The salsa was great and the goat cheese fundido was good but the actual entrees were not that great besides the beans, rice and grits which were good. The steak in the enchiladas ( one enchilada was half missing steak) was very fatty and chewy. The lobster taco was very bland and the pork in the burrito wasn't much better. To much competition to rush back besides for happy hour and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 2 stars...but my husband is advocating I give them 3. I wear the pants in our house so 2 stars, it is!   I had the pig absurdity and it was okay but overpriced at $18. My husband ordered the hot sauce flight and a special burrito that we can't recall the name of but it's best they just don't offer it again anyway... His complaints were that everything seemed to have an overwhelming vinegar flavor in both the burrito and the hot sauces. I did enjoy my mango margarita and we both loved the grits that accompanied our burritos.  To sum it up - - It's a cute overpriced restaurant that we don't plan on going to again..."}
{"text":"I cannot say this word with enough joy and happiness in my voice, for I have found a place that made me very, very happy. That place...?  LOPEZ.   I've eaten at a few places that served Mexican cuisine. This was 1000 times better. And truthfully, I couldn't call it EXACTLY Mexican; it is much much more.   Lopez is located on Lee road in Cleveland Heights, just past the library. The parking is either valet, or if you like there's a ton across the street at a local parking garage, but either way, very accessible. Now I've passed this place for years and thought it too trendy/expensive for my taste. However, tonight, my wife and I, after mutual difficult day, decided to celebrate...surviving the day, so we went to Lopez as we'd never been there before.   We were happy we did.   They serve what could be called Mexican, but with a flair and a blend of tastes that not only work well, but create part of a wonderful taste experience. I had the pulled pork carnitas fajitas, and my Wife had a their mix and match Tacos, (you can choose a variety, but she had lobster, a vegetarian mushroom/goat cheese combo and steak, all of which were SUPERB.) My fajitas were served with smoky sauces and spiced just right. It was GREAT.   Lopez also has a variety of drinks, from a multitude of beers to margaritas and a vast array of whiskies. They even had a bourbon sampler and you could also get a sampler of their creative whisky shots. Their bar was quite impressive.   We were also struck by the kindness and the service. Our server Andrew was great, and I wanted to mention him here because he was part of the reason we had such a great night. His suggestions were helpful and his whole attitude of looking to our needs was customer service gold.   Also, Craig, the gentleman Manager, was very kind and answered a lot of our questions. Everything was great.   Now, their prices are a bit upscale; an average entree clocks in at just under 20 bucks, but if you want to take out that special someone, impress a client or just have a nice experience, it's worth it.   All I can say if I'm going to take someone somewhere to show them some of the best of Cleveland, I'm going to do so by way of Mexico; Viva Lopez!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a traditional, homey Mexican restaurant, Lopez is not for you. If you're looking for a more American take on Mexican food with large portions in an upscale atmosphere then you've found the place! The margaritas are fresh, the tequila menu is impressive and the food is better than most options for Tex-mex/Southwest in the area.   Highly recommend the carnitas!"}
{"text":"This place is the grossest to the mostest. Sorry guys and gals learn how to make Mexican food (biased here since I'm born and raised in California).   First off the chips and salsa were super mediocre. We ordered the lobster guac and it wasn't anything special - just tasted like plain guacamole. The pickled veggies on the side were the only good thing that night.   I ordered the lobster enchilada. SO BAD. First of all the lobster was so tough and fishy it smelled up the whole dish (isn't seafood supposed to not smell like seafood?) Next up the dish was absolutely drenched in a cheesy cream sauce and there was way too much cheese on top. I think the tortillas were flour? I couldn't tell."}
{"text":"Lopez has the potential to be great.  Unfortunately its hard to think of a reason to go back because:  1) if we are craving mod mex- we would go to momocho which is similarly priced (maybe a lil bit more) but offers higher quality and more original food (in my opinion).  2) if we are craving true mexican flavor we would just got to mi pueblo taqueria (on lorain) which has great authentic tacos, etc.     -The mojitos were decent, however when one combines cheap rum with mint it inevitably tastes like mint flavored medicine.    -Their house salad was delicious- appropriate portion, unique and tasty.   -Their steak enchiladas were more like an enchilada-fajita hybrid- which was fine b/c the ingredient quality was good (steak tasted like steak).    -The sage/bluecheese/bacon guac was all that it was made out to be- delicious.  -Tequilia list was expansive.  All in all, might go back again b/c their salad was really good and just to try more menu options.  Also, although we didn't dine in there- it looks like they have a fairly large area that would be conducive to parties which might be worth taking advantage of."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Duck under cover Burrito   was phenomenal, the brisket, lamb and fish tacos were also excellent Chef Michael Herschman is one of Cleveland's finest chefs. The watermelon margaritas were spectacular. If you haven't been to Lopez you should definitely make a trip there!"}
{"text":"Our visit started out fine. Quickly taken to our table, drink orders taken and chips brought out. When our food came out, our friend who is pregnant saw her taco had soft cheese on top- she flagged over the waitress, apologized, said she can't have unpaturized cheese, may she have tacos without cheese. Waitress took her tacos back- within a few minutes \"new\" tacos were brought out. My friend began eating, only to notice once she got past the new salsa on top there was still cheese on her taco. They had just scraped off the previous salsa and cheese on top and brought the same tacos back out. She called the waitress over, showed her the cheese. The waitress said the white crumbles in the taco were a black bean and proceeded to scold our friend for not letting her know in the beginning of our visit that she couldn't eat cheese! It was embarrassing to be treated this way!"}
{"text":"I grew around the corner from Lopez and totally loved it growing up. However, I hadn't been back once in the last 7 or so years until two weeks ago for Taco night on Tuesday. If I had to vote for the best Mexican in Cleveland, it would be Lopez. It's not your typical hole in the wall with hole in the wall prices. It's upscale Mexican flair and the prices show. However, on Taco Tuesday, tacos are half off. However, I do believe the special ends at 8pm, so be weary of such. I'm a big guy and can eat 4-5 tacos no problem at Coastal Taco or 3 are Barrio. 2 is ample here! They are huge and packed tight! Great classic margaritas. Check out CLE Urban Winery next door. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lopez rounds out to be about an average of 4 stars. Keep reading for the full review!  Here are the best parts of Lopez:  5: THE PATIO. To kick off what my friends and I call \"patiopalooza\" (where we go enjoy different patios all across Cleveland), we went to Lopez, even when it was fairly chilly outside (around 55 degrees.) What's so great about Lopez's patio is that they not only have heat lamps, but they have felt ponchos on each seat so that you can wear to stay warm! With their market lights, Lopez was a very festive first patiopalooza experience.  5: The service. Our waitress was really fun and engaging, and we later found out that she worked there because she loved it - the people, the atmosphere, etc. This definitely helps make a difference in our experience!  The not so great parts:  3.5: The food. Overall, it was pretty good, though some things could have been done with better finesse. You get complimentary chips and salsa, which is pretty standard. It wasn't too salty and it was pretty flavorful. I ordered a special for the evening, which was a \"giant spider roll\" -- a huge burrito with fried soft shell crab inside. MMM. Good concept and good flavors, but the liquid inside the burrito made the arugula and burrito wrap really soggy. It was a huge serving though - enough for two meals.  3: The price. Even with the huge servings, it was very expensive. $7 for a taco is overpriced, and even with my softshell crab burrito, I think it could have been less expensive.   I'll probably be back for the ambiance, but not necessarily for the food."}
{"text":"Seems to be a favorite in the Heights.  Usually underwhelmed.  Drinks are good, salsa is lame. Their habanero sauce is legit though. Probably need to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Our first visit was Valentine's Day in 2013 and visit at least a few times each year.  Getting to the restaurant is a tedious trip for us, so we make our visits for special occasions.  The food is always perfect and the margaritas are made to perfection."}
{"text":"I visited Lopez for an event thrown by my work. The staff was lovely, but my entree let me down.  I started with a pineapple margarita rimmed with spicy salt. It was absolutely delicious and was not too sweet.   Next, I had the guacamole appetizer. The guacamole itself was good, but I'm not a huge fan of inedible garnishes, and I bit into one that was just that.  The dish itself wasn't ruined, but the greatness of the chips and guac couldn't be appreciated as easily while fighting to politely spit into a napkin.  Next I tried the calamari dish, which was very good, but lacked some spice. The flavor was good, but slightly too sweet, though the calamari was cooked well.  I can not remember the name of the next dish I tried, but I believe it was a shrimp dish. It was delicious.  The salad we were given was mediocre. I am known for finishing every spot of food, but this looked like a essentially a cooked-to-wilt head of lettuce with some cheese and roasted garlic on top. The garlic was delicious, but the lettuce was overcooked and essentially ended up being another inedible garnish.  For my entree, I had the jarden quesadillas. Unfortunately, this is where the restaurant lost me. The greens inside the quesadilla was extremely bitter, making it hard to eat and completely eclipsing the beautiful sauce they had painstakingly and beautifully drizzled over the rest of the quesadillas.  I will absolutely visit Lopez again, but I will be very careful about my entree selection."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to Lopez for Mexican food. Have come here for years. Especially like the outdoor seating. Guacamole is good. Pickled vegetables. Went again last night. The food was good but last night the service was really slow so thus the four stars. We really enjoy the angry hippie. Caesar salad was a new try last night and was very good. We are vegetarian so I wish they would sometimes have another vegetarian entree to try besides the four that are part of their standard menu. The margaritas are excellent. Will be back but hope for a bit faster service. Finally had to ask Hugh to get our check......"}
{"text":"Since Michael Hershmann arrived we have been back a number of times and each visit has been enjoyable. It's not that it was bad before, it was just average. The last visit offered a wonderful Salmon special. The Gouda Grits side dish was so good it could almost ( almost) be a main dish.   This place has been in Cleveland Heights for years and after that time you might assume a sloppy result. Not so. They remain very on-game."}
{"text":"I had the lobster burritos and sampled a bit of my friends' dishes.  Excellent food.    While I understand the prices to be a bit on the high end by comparison to the area, I managed to have one of the more expensive items on the menu, the bourbon flight and an appetizer for less than I spend for a modestly expensive night out in any other number of cities.  So, perhaps pricey locally but actually a good deal.  We ate outside, so I don't have a strong impression of the flow of the venue normally.  Service was top rate.  If the experience is consistent, then Cleveland has a nice hidden gem."}
{"text":"Overall weak experience. Let's start with the chips and salsa. The chips were stale and the salsa was bland. My large margarita had virtually no alcohol in it. The Southwest poutine had very few french fries, even less cheese, and a teeny bit of gravy. And two minutes after my appetizer was brought out my entrée was delivered. Everybody in our party that got the brisket taco thought they were awful.  To top it all off, our party of six had a gratuity of 20% added to the bill, which I wouldn't mind if the service was good, but it was mediocre. I used to love this restaurant, I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I can walk in here and always have perfect guacamole or salsa!  Spicy, juicy and made fresh daily!  I enjoy their simple items like soups, bisques, and tacos.  The queso fundido is awful, not what you will expect and made with goat cheese! What are they thinking??? Recommendation from a true foodie and fan of Latin food...go back to the original recipe!  The shrimp and grits is a good meal, well prepared, but over priced.  Lastly, the drinks and so hit or miss!  There is never enough alcohol and you have to get a side shot to make it a real, grown up drink... making it one very expensive cocktail!  Get your drink on across the street at Fix Bistro!"}
{"text":"Last night I ate at Lopez's for a third time and yet again Lopez failed! I keep going back because I live around the corner, love Mexican food, and the patio/restaurant always seem to be full - we kept saying \"no, it was just a bad night, we made poor choices\". However, we're DONE. This place serves tasteless food that is WAY to expensive for what it is.     Lopez has a good atmosphere, decent service, a beautiful outdoor area and that's it...the food is really bad, and the margarita's are worse.  Another reviewer described the margarita as \"gatorade and tequila\" and that's exactly what it taste like.   Btw- my husband is from S. America and I from Central America, admittedly not Mexican, but this food is subpar (and our Latino friends agree).  In summary- save your money and time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Much of my previous review (11/29/08) still stands, but over the past year I've become more of a fan of this place.  I still feel that it's a bit over-priced, but the food is really quite consistently good, the service is excellent, the atmosphere is very comfortable.  Kid-friendly, couple-friendly, everyone-friendly.  And they have some great specials on Margaritas from time to time. Upgrade to 4-stars for quality and consistency."}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere for large groups, pretty outdoor patio and, more importantly, KILLER margaritas."}
{"text":"This is an interesting restaurant, but it's for sure not Mexican. I will say that Lopez is calling themselves a southwestern restaurant, NOT Mexican so I can give them that,  but if anything it's really Southwestern American fusion. So please don't go looking for real Mexican food at this place or you will surely be disappointed. If you can get past the unusual menu with things like blue cheese, arugula, and eggplant  in burritos then you might like this place. For me it was difficult, but I was out for a friend's birthday so I kept my mouth shut and ordered the fajitas as they sounded like the most traditional dish on the menu. Surprisingly, it was actually very tasty with a large portion of chicken, soft tortillas, spicy salsa and lots to take home. My husband on the other hand didn't come away as lucky. He tried the beef enchiladas and gave it a big thumbs down as it turned out to be bland mush rolled in a tortilla. I also saw a friend leave a mushroom and goat cheese taco mostly untouched and I don't wonder why. Prices were high, $7.50 for a thousand island taco and you are required to order 2. The restaurant was also very loud. It was hard to hear others at the table. I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Upping to five stars. Consistently great service and food. The watermelon margarita and corn fritters (on special) were excellent."}
{"text":"Service, food, and drinks were all great! I highly recommend the calamari appetizer - honestly the best calamari I've ever had. It was a bit pricy, but the waiter did inform me that they have special deals on certain week nights"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. I will be back.  The corn grits were amazing, nice fresh salsa, and very friendly people"}
{"text":"I can't sing the praises of Michael Herschman enough.  We have a child with multiple life threatening food allergies and 4 other members in our family.  Lopez is our favorite restaurant of all!!  The food is amazing and the service is top notch.  We consistently get high quality food with the security of knowing our child is safe.  Michael really is as good as they come.  The food is awesome all around .  You are missing out if you don't dine here.  Seriously!"}
{"text":"This place did really really bad tonight.  Service was terrible and the food was not much better. Everyone around us got served quickly but for us 45 minutes passed before we even got our soup. Some guy in a polo circled the patio handing out blankets which was a nice touch, but our waters sat empty most of the meal. Too bad, Lopez."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Great margaritas, great gucamole. Everything's a bit expensive, but well worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Thursday night with one of my best gal pals. We weren't sure if there was going to be a happy hour since we showed up after 7 and didn't exactly plan on heading to Lopez. We were in the area and decided to drop in. It had been years since either of us had been there.  Lucky for us, as soon as we sat down we were told that margaritas were half off all night. So, we hunkered down for chit-chat and ordered crispy green beans and calamari off of the appetizer menu. I got the skinny margarita option. (I know, a girl who tries to watch her calorie in-take... yawn.) But really, if you're wanting a margarita that's more sour than it is sweet - I'd recommend it strictly for that reason and not because you're gonna save *maybe* 50 calories. In terms of \"skinny margarita\" options - the only other one I've come across in Cleveland is at Barrio - and yes, it's on the happy hour menu so you get it half priced at $3.50 as opposed to $7. So, yes it's cheaper than Lopez. BUT, you get less than you do at Lopez. So... if you're looking for more bang for your buck... or your just looking to get drunk... ;-)    I digress...  Service was fine - we weren't really in need of that much attention - once we had our drinks and snacks we were in good shape. A water refill here and there, and besides that, no interruptions from staff or patrons.   I don't really know why it's been years since I've been back to Lopez. The food was just like I remembered, actually, it was even better! The green beans had a great batter on them and the calamari made me want to lick my fingers.   This is another great happy hour/ladies night destination to choose from. I definitely want to go back again or make this a more regular stomping ground.   The only drawback to me, is metered parking in the Cleveland Heights neck-o-the-woods. However, I heard a rumor that since Cleveland is trying out the new credit-card swipe/mobile app pays... we may not have to deal with this small annoyance for much longer!!"}
{"text":"Had someone recommend this restaurant to us while we were in town. The waitress was super friendly and helpful in explaining any questions we had! Wasn't too impressed with the food though, and the service was super slow. It was a great atmosphere and all the employees seemed happy to be working. But faster service would have been a lot better"}
{"text":"In summary, dinner at Lopez fell short of expectations.  The dining area was a little on the garish side, but my main course was pretty good.  In the end, I think when you toss around Rick Bayless's name on your website--even if it was for something some 30 years ago--the bar gets raised a little bit,.  When you don't meet those expectations, you're going to fall a little harder than others.  For an appetizer we started with a simple order of traditional guacamole.  The chips were okay--not too salty or too oily--but even along with the guacamole and salsa (which were at least both fresh), the combination proved to be nothing special.  I expected something more from the restaurant than the blandness of the standard issue salsa.  The guacamole did come with some pickled vegetables which were a welcome and unexpected addition.  The Lobster Enchiladas were actually very good.  The lobster and cheese cream mixed well with the lobster and shrimp in the enchilada to make a very tasty and texturally pleasing (the shrimp tacos at Deagan's came to mind) dish.  On the other hand, my cucumber margarita was really lacking in taste and kick, leaving me wanting for the same drink I've had a while ago at Momocho.  Service was decent and problem-free.  I thought the restaurant decor was a little overdone around our table near the entrance, and I feel it set the wrong vibe and detracted a little bit from the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Lopez a few times before I joined Yelp.  My experiences were pretty much the same: sub-par and overpriced food.  My most recent visit was no different.  First of all, their draft beers are $7 for a pint, and $9 for a 22 oz.  Granted, they have a couple good craft beers on tap, but it seems excessive.  Our apps (calamari and guacamole) were the best part of our meal, although $9 for a serving of guacamole is a joke.  My wife and I split the P5 BMF burrito.  It was BMF, as advertized, but the ingredients were not very palatable.  My wife had a fair amount of gristle in her portion, I had some bone, and we both found the pork belly to be way too chewy...and inedible.  I will mention that our server was very friendly, so that is worth the second star in my rating.  Well, this will be our last trip here.  Best of luck, Lopez."}
{"text":"Great food! Good service. Nice atmosphere.  I would recommend highly. The margaritas were bad either!"}
{"text":"My second visit to Lopez and boy was it a treat.  Known for their excellent margaritas, this South Western establishment delivers yet again!  I ordered the BMF burrito and she had the pulled pork wet burritos. Of course, these were complimented by their delicious pitcher of margaritas.  A worthwhile mention is that their margarita pitcher is also 50% off during happy hour!  Service: My waiter was Jason and he answered any/all questions we had. He was incredibly accommodating and even offered additional tips as to certain places to shop outside of Lopez for ingredients in homemade cocktails. Food came quick! During our meal a lady offered to bring us some new marg glasses with fresh ice. Hostess was nice even when we disputed whether or not to sit in or outside.  Food: Excellent. Tastes great and well worth a wait. Ingredients taste fresh!  Price: A bit above average ($38 marg pitcher, $18.50 BMF burrito). However, I would have no problems revisiting this fine establishment as all other aspects are top notch.  Atmosphere: Nice interior. Awesome patio. Bar looks nice. They have a clear glass window into the kitchen so you could technically see your food being prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing how after all these years Lopez continues to dish out some of the best Mexican food in the area.  Lopez has always taken a nonconventional approach with a sense of humor.  Note the bottle of water on the table or the plaque up front with the other \"locations\" around the world.    Lopez is a bright loud room with plenty of cool looking art on the walls.  On a busy night it can be hard to have a conversation, but the great food and outstanding drinks more then make up for it.  You start with a little bag of fresh chips and a dish of bright salsa.  Order up one of the best Margaritas in town and peruse the menu.    The calamari appetizer is a cannot miss dish.  Perfectly fried pieces of squid are served it an expertly balance sweet and hot sauce with some diced carrots, peppers and fruit.  I have to order this every time I am at Lopez.  The entrees offer an interesting mix, with some excellent taco choices, way overstuffed burritos and fajitas.  The trout is always excellent, nicely cooked and with a tasty stuffing. The portions are generous and the food quality is excellent.    Yes the prices are more then if you go to the neighborhood Mexican place, but that is because this is a chef driven restaurant serving high quality food.  When you compare the prices to similar places such as Momocho, they are similar.    Lopez has been doing this for decades and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for over a year because of logistics to where I live.   First off the parking is easy.  The drinks are amazing fresh and new. Next time I will uber there so I can enjoy more then one. We actually started with a main course as the appetizer along with the guacamole trio which was over the top. The southwest fish and chips with sweet potato fries where amazing crunchy and the dill tartar sauce was beyond fresh and light. The lobster enchilada had huge chunks of lobster and very nice finish cream sauce. We added a flight of hot sauces that ranged from mild to sweet hot. All I can say is I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"We asked for huevos rancheros and were told that the chef couldn't do that. Really?  If you have eggs, salsa, beans, and tortillas, which they did, why not?  Attitude problem, which became ever more blatant.   We told the server that we disliked the music that was playing and asked politely for something different. Got more of the same.  Eventually the owner came out and escalated the situation instead of caring about his customers enough to resolve it, which would have been easily done by playing any of a million other styles. But he was fiercely defensive of his musical tastes and his right to inflict them on us. In the face of his persistent hostility and abusive attitude, we left. I didn't even get to taste my meal but my wife tasted hers and said it was, surprisingly, bad. We've been there many times and always liked it, but we won't be back.  P.S.  A day after this review was posted, the owner emailed me his threat that he would complain to my employer if I didn't delete it. Enough said. After all, mine is not the only strongly negative review he has earned."}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, I am looking for a regular hangout.  If you are there on a day when you can sit outside, do so.  The menu is southwest, NOT Mexican.  The Ceviche is very good.  The salsa is fresh, along with the chips.  The menu is diverse, with interesting items.  The only concern I have is consistency.  Some menu items are very good, others not so much.  Nice bar selection."}
{"text":"Most of my friends loooove this place. I'm not much of a mexican food eater, so personally, i usually don't come here for their food. That said, Lopez has such great happy hour deals and food choices though.  Drinks: Half off margaritas! Their margaritas are great and during the summer, they have half off margaritas! The mojitos at lopez are also reallyyyy good.  Food: I haven't had most of their food, but they have these really delicious salsa & chips that they bring out to each table. definitely also try their lobster enchilada.  Overall: I go here all the time to grab drinks with friends during the summer. Most people I know love their food and personally, I love the atmosphere at Lopez. As good of a restaurant, there aren't any foods/drinks here that I'd specially remember it for (hence the 3-star). For me, this is kind of just the place to chill."}
{"text":"Echoing a few of the other reviews, I have to compliment this place for several things. First of all, the service. It's always enthusiastic, friendly, helpful and attentive. Next would be the atmosphere. For some reason I always have a great time when coming in. There's also a great patio for the warmer months. Finally, I'll compliment the bar. Very good selection and specials.   Maybe not quite hitting the mark for me have been the entrees. The menu is interesting, but I've yet to be blown away by my meal...exception being the grits with jalapeño and Gouda.  Maybe it's been my selections.  Either way the positives will bring me back for another try!"}
{"text":"Second time dinning at Lopez. First time was great, I would say 4 or 5 star, but our most recent experience was very, very different. Went on a Wednesday night to celebrate some birthdays. Had 4 drinkers at the table so decided to order a pitcher of the mojitos for $43. We maybe got 4 short glasses out of it, 5 if you count all the ice when it melted. Super sweet, very little rum. For the price it was totally not worth it. A singe mojito (which I have had there before; decent size and you could taste the rum) is $8.50. We would have saved $9 if we had just each gotten our own mojitos. Super disappointing. Guacamole didn't come out until entree's did; so much for an appetizer. The Porkadelic BMF is just way too much meat. If you are into that, then go for it. But the individual in our party who got it could barely make it through half and then had an upset stomach the rest of the night. The Buenos Dias BMF was great,  we do recommend. Another  individual in our party ordered 3 different tacos, didn't receive 1 of them. We alerted the waitress, told her we didn't want the 3rd one that was ordered since we still had all the guacamole to finish and to take it off our bill. She said she would. Service was slow all around. When we did get the bill, found we were charged for two guacamole apps even though we only order one, and we had still been charged for 3 tacos instead of 2 (I am not going to explain in depth but short story is we watched her take off the one taco since we were right next to the POS machine, but she ended up charging us twice for one of the other ones we did get). Overall not a great dinning experience. Don't really wanna go back there again and it's a shame since it's so close and we share a name."}
{"text":"I have never posted a review but I just feel it is Necessary... Me and my guy eat out all the time and I have never been more disappointed in the food maybey I ordered the wrong entrée (chicken enchiladas) I don't know what they put in them but to me it tasted like Raw chicken...  Although I will say that the people that worked there are very nice and attentive... Eating there again ... I will never do."}
{"text":"Excellent Spanish/Mexican food with the flair of chef/owner Michael Herschman.  This is not the usual \"Tex-Mex  food. Service is excellent, as usual and the restaurant runs like a well oiled clock managed by Hugh. Lopez's patio ranks with the best in the city."}
{"text":"Lopez has weird hours to me. It may actually be the case, but it seems that way. I think the bar opens at 4pm, the kitchen at like 5 then the kitchen closes at like (i dunno) 10 then the bar stays open.  It's odd when you're there eating and enjoying the bar and then all of a sudden there are chairs upside down on tables. If something makes you feel like you should \"get out\" it's that.  OK so anyway. There is apparently a happy hour. I know because I was there at this time (which I'm not completely convinced was any particular time) and my friend said, \"It's half off tequila.\" You would NEVER know this. It's not on the website, the bartender didn't mention it. I didn't see a sign. Maybe I'm a fool, but I think not.  The food is tasty. I'm vegetarian and the mushroom quesadilla is what I  recommend. My meat eating friend got the same and loved it equally. The margaritas are well made. I know my margaritas and these worked their purpose. There's a lot of tequila to chose from and a fairly decent take on a Mexican menu.  The one thing you may want to consider before trekking to Lopez is that this is not an authentic Mexican menu. It's more Americanized than some may like. Maybe more revisions Lopez! We don't get many Mexican joints in Ohio, hook us up!  So try Lopez for some kinda Mexican food and drink tequila while you're there, maybe then you won't care about the non-Mexican choices."}
{"text":"Food - delicious.  They start you off, like all Mexican restaurants, with chips and salsa. They kept filling ours too, and the salsa was fresh and tasty.  To add to our appetizer, I got the guacamole and it was superb. You could taste the fresh, high quality avocados in it.  I also got the veggie chile relleno.  Best I've ever had (not that I've had that many). It came out hot and crispy, impressively portioned, served with a side of various pickled vegetables (if you like pickles, like I do, go here).   The service was okay but was not that great. We didn't wait long for anything, but we were not blown away by our server.  She seemed kind of cold towards us, but she did the job.   As far as the price goes, it's more than you would pay at Chi-Chis, but I feel it's worth it. You get higher quality food and large portions.    The beer list was great. Their tequila selection was awesome and helped to soothe my stomach from a rough night before.   Lopez on Lee - you (almost) complete me."}
{"text":"If you enjoy slightly different Mexican fare and are willing to drop a little coin then you should love Lopez. Thye have been at it a very long time and that has to tell you something. Happy hour is a bargain!! Service is always good (sometimes great) and several of their dishes are just excellent. The pepita crusted trout and the lobster enchiladas just to name two. Their queso fundido can vary from outstanding to dull as dirt. The drinks are a little on the expensive side, particularly the margaritas. However, we always walk away happy, buzzed and pleasantly full. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place better - I want to, but the food is always a little underwhelming for the price. The signature margaritas are very good, as are most of the appetizers. Still, the main dishes are a little lackluster and everything feels about 10% more expensive than it needs to be."}
{"text":"Great and unique food! I would definitely recommend happy hour - carnitas taco, shrimp & grits, fundido and much more. Each $5 plus featured Margarita, drafts and wine. You can't go wrong...Try this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat on the east side. First of all, I love the atmosphere. The outdoor patio is fantastic. Service is always excellent and you can tell the food is quality and fresh. Although they can be a bit pricey, I don't mind paying a little extra for above standard Mexican food. This place is not your regular rice and beans. Go for happy hour for sure to save a few dollars and get the pineapple margarita, it's heaven in a glass."}
{"text":"It's really hard to write a review about Lopez. I've been there twice and both times were an okay experience. My husband absolutely loves them. The margaritas were very tasty and the service was excellent. But, the food just wasn't up to par. I guess I was expecting Mexican inspired food? What I got was American with a little bit of spice added. Like, I said. I've been there twice. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Lopez is always good!  Tonight I had the smoked gouda jalapeno grits.  AWESOME! Creamy and delicious.  And the spicy grilled shrimp taco. Very tasty! They have several margarita flavors.  My fave is the hibiscus! Servers have been great every time I've been there. And the bartender really knows how to pour a drink \"neat\"!"}
{"text":"Lopez has a pretty good outdoor dining area and the food was better than average with a good ambiance. I would go back if I was in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day and the place was jumpin'. The atmosphere was great (old, young, casual, and up-beat) and the staff catered to our every need from the moment we walked in.  First things first, if you have time to stop over at the bar, make sure to give a big shout-out to the bar chef, Mark: he's got a BIG personality and is very generous with the drinks (if he likes you!) The mojitos were wonderful.  Second, the guac was perfection and has got a slight kick to it (for the price the proportion was small :( Third, the lobster enchiladas are to-die-for and come with a watermelon sauce that is ridiculous! Fourth, you've got to try the sautéed spinach-raisin pepita and gouda-jalapeno grits...who would have thought? Sixth: We also got the half chicken mole pablano, which was fried to perfection, but a lil' dry. I would not order this again. Fifth: Okay, it IS pricey, but worth a stop in for those enchiladas. It's lobster for god's sake."}
{"text":"helloooooo margaritas and lobster tacos. what more do i need to say?????  cute bags of chips and yummy salsa. the bags are like old school teeny brown lunch bags. just adorbs in my opinion. jalapeno margarita. yep. jalapeno margarita. who woulda thunk???? in addition to that flavor, there's MANY more, including but not limited to mango, hibiscus, ......the list is long. they used to do a 1/2 price night but i think it is just a certain time now, from say 6-8 or 4-6. dont quote me.  ok, onto more important things. food. um, holy yumminess. mexican meets modern fusion. the tacos. ahhhh. i am salivating just thinking about them. lobster is my FAVORITE. notice all caps. they are my FAVORITE. HUGE pieces of lobster meat. they are just phenomenal. like really good.  the other yummy dish is the goat cheese fundido. (sp?) it comes with fried like chips for dipping goodness. holy yum. like really holy yum. do your tastebuds a favor and hop, run or skip over to lopez. for some mexican deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Lopez is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Cleveland, and yes, I know some will disagree and favor another delicious Mexican restaurant over in Tremont.  I love their chips and salsa, which is always delivered promptly to the table after your arrival.  They have a great happy hour with half off margaritas, so be sure to get yourself one!  I usually get the Lopez Traditional margarita, but my friends love the cucumber and mango margaritas as well.  I usually get their Blu Rodeo burrito.  This deliciously blue cheesy burrito is filled with skirt steak, spicy sautéed spinach, and plenty of cheese including blue cheese.  It's served with a  side of gouda jalapeno grits which I loveee.  Their lobster enchilads, while a little expensive, are decadent and rich in flavor.  When I feel like a splurge, I go for the lobster enchiladas.  I've never had an issue with service here.  They are always more than friendly, quick to remind you when happy hour is ending so you can get another round of drinks for half price.  They have a wonderful patio when it is warm outside that is surrounded by flowers.    The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the food isn't 100% consistent.  The last time I went it wasn't quite at it's A game, but I've been there many, many times before when it was delicious.  Everyone is allowed to have a bad day once in a while right?  Overall, you should check this place out.  Get some guac, a margarita, kick your feet up on their patio and enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"Well my wife and I were a little confused about them getting 3 stars.  Seems like the reviews are bipolar about things and you either hate it or love it.. such is most of our lives.   But oh well, I'm Mexican and new to the area and we are always looking for Mexican meals.   But oh well we decided to give it a try due to the bipolar nature of the reviews with the in laws.  I would not say that they are strictly traditional but really trying to push the envelope in a good way.  Yes  I would say it is more pricey than Chipotle, but they really do try hard to cook out of the box and try to give great service.     I had duck under cover and thought it was great and could not finish it so I had duck for lunch the next day.   My wife and in laws also  liked their meals.   So in the end though not traditional I thought it was untraditionally great.    About the other contradictory reviews I do not know what to say.... just that you need to try this place and give it a shot like we did."}
{"text":"The food was tasty. I am a very picky eater, so finding something on the menu can be a stretch sometimes. But I didn't have that problem here. A very stylish place with good flavor."}
{"text":"We moved here not long ago from California. We Californians know, and love, good Mexican food and we missed it terribly. We were told when we moved to Cleveland Heights, how much we would love 'Lopez', and that our search for great Mexican food was finally over. However, nothing could have been further from the truth. The food tasted ok, but it wasn't anything special, nothing like that which we had been promised.  Unlike the real Mexican food, from real mexican cooks (such as in Painesville, OH) this was just more of the same old chain-style Mexican  food...just more expensive ingredients and a nicer display on the plates. It looked pretty and our hopes were high.  BUT... two of our meals were cold and one seemed to have an \"off\" taste...not quite right, but our 16-yr-old son ate it anyway; and then THREW UP UNTIL 4:00 a.m., when he finally fell asleep in my lap.  When I called Lopez the next day to warn them they had some bad food at the end of the night (we were the last customers); they only wanted my name and number. I wasn't making a claim or complaint;  but I gave it to them anyway. We have never returned. Bad food, in more ways than one!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Go check out the happy hour menu. I thought the HH margarita WAS  to sweet so I had to get a drink off my menu"}
{"text":"If I was stuck on an island with a volleyball named Wilson and had the option to eat at Lopez instead of foraging in the wild for my own food, I think I'd chose the latter. I'd risk my life alone (well, with Wilson in tow), on the island, hunting my own food instead of just popping into Lopez for an easy meal if it ever existed on my mythical deserted island. How is that for describing how less than thrilled I was of Lopez?  Now, let me preface this review by saying that the service we had was stellar. Our dude was very hospitable and nice. It wasn't his fault the place stinks. Literally. There was a foul smell coming from the men's room when I used it. It didn't exactly set a comforting tone for the meal that followed.   First came a small bag of tortillas and a very watery salsa that lacked any sort of noticeable seasoning or spice. Bland described it to a tee. But it was free, so I let it slide. Next we ordered the traditional guac. Out came a small bowl of browning, less than appealing guacamole. Again, lacking flavor. Salt or lime juice could have brightened this dish up, but neither were present. The brownish color of the guac indicated that it was pre-made, possibly sitting in the kitchen dying until we ordered. Unacceptable.   Next we ordered two entrees that were again, disappointing. How does one mess up a \"smoked brisket enchilada\"? That sounds amazing, right? Meh. Not really. Again, it was bland. I didn't taste any \"smoke\" either. A smoked brisket is technically a pastrami. The meat in this tasted more like a nitrite free Hormel brand corned beef.    Yes there are some redeeming qualities in Lopez. The decor is very southwestern-y. Vibrant colors, tile tables, open dining space, etc. The patio looks pretty charming too with all the lights strung about. But a friendly server and a cute atmosphere isn't nearly enough to make up for the abomination on a plate and ransom they ask for it.   The overall theme of Lopez seems to be that it's supremely overpriced. $9 for a basic guac made from a single avocado. $6.50 for a single taco, minimum of two per order. Enchiladas beginning at $18. An 8oz margarita made from a generic syrup concentrate cost $7.50. All of this would be perfectly acceptable mind you, if the customer got the perception of receiving value in return. Which unfortunately wasn't the case. I rarely complain of price. But the food must deliver. Lopez failed to deliver. I'll continue to forage. If anything, it'll be more fulfilling than overpaying for the blandness coming out of the Lopez kitchen.   After our meal, I tried to remember the last time, if ever, I was let down by the usually safe Mexican cuisine. I mean, even in the right context or state of mind, Taco Bell can be satisfying. It's not a hard cuisine to make good for chrissakes. I'm pretty sure the infamous Taco Tuesday's, as served by the burly hairnet wearing lunch-ladies in the school cafeteria of my elementary youth was a better experience than what we had at Lopez."}
{"text":"food wasn't bad; taco WAY WAY overpriced.  I had flan as dessert and the biscotti was very soggy, they taste old; and the waitress was not only apologetic but tried to blame the weather being humid...sure; dessert was way overpriced as well.  Will not go back there again.  Not worth it.  Two tacos + 1 flan = $30"}
{"text":"We had a very good experience last night and many other times in the past.  I don't understand all of the bad reviews.  The atmosphere is great and in nice weather their patio is the place to be.  Their margaritas are probably my favorite in the city (the jalapeno is awesome!).  I had the BMF Veggie burrito last night and it was very good while my husband had a chicken dish which he enjoyed.  We also shared the hot sauce sampler which I highly recommend.  The server was great and gave us a free order of guac because the kitchen made an extra one.  My only complaint was that the chips were not fresh last night.  Other than that, everything was fantastic, as usual."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Lopez when we couldn't get into Barrio. Almost left as the place look dated and smelled like everyone ordered fish. Oh was I glad I stayed! Chips and salsa were fantastic, salsa was actually fresh! Guacamole sampler was pretty good, nothing to go crazy about but the pickled spiced veggies that came with it were amazing. I ordered the buenos dias burrito and it was to die for. Definitely coming back! Oh the margaritas were good too! I recommended the orange spiced rim."}
{"text":"Traveled a little out of my way because I had heard this was a good place to get some really good food. The service was actually pretty good and they have valet service, so that actually came in handy because it was a little cold out. But getting back to the food....... the guacamole was ok, nothing really special and my daughter complained that her rice had no flavor. I tried the catfish, lobster and shrimp tacos and they were ok, again nothing special. All in all I would have to say that it was a good dining experience but I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time here and consider it among the better Cleveland restaurants out there.  It is a little pricey, but the food is unique and comes in ridiculously huge portions.  Group favorites included the cactus margarita, bacon/pineapple guacamole, and lobster enchiladas.  For an added kick, try out the gorilla hot sauce with your food.  Sharing is a must."}
{"text":"We called ahead about the wait and were told it was a 20 min wait but we'd be put on \"the list\" (oooh).  Upon checking in at the 20 min mark, the hostess told us that we'd need to wait 10 more minutes.  Okay, fine.  FORTY MINUTES LATER..after we were repeatedly assured that we were next... we were seated.  DON'T WASTE MY TIME by lying to me about the wait.  Repeatedly. WTF!!    To the manager's credit, he came over to apologize and offer us free dessert (we didn't take it).  Dude, tell your people not to lie.  It's much more appreciated than free dessert.  Food: yummy but seriously overpriced. Service: excellent, totally rescued the evening."}
{"text":"Update to my previous 5 star review.  OMG - I have been to Lopez about 40 times for dinner since moving here - even more for drinks.  Never at a restaurant have I been treated like I was on my most recent trip.  I ordered their special margarita @ 17$ USD it was horrible.  Basically roses lime mixed with high end tequila.   Not sure why this would be acceptable to anyone - let alone a place that would call themselves a \"tequila saloon\" - when I told our waitress I thought the drink was horrible - here are some actual quotes from her;  \"it's pre-made\", \"I don't know what you want me to do\" and \"I don't know what you like\" and later in the conversation \"I don't know what you expect me to do\" - it was all so confrontational, we all felt so uncomfortable we wanted to leave.  I don't even know if I can give justice to how awful we felt - the two women at the table could even look the server in the eyes afterwards - it was just pure awful.  I don't think I have ever been spoken down to like that in my life - let alone at a place I am paying to eat at.  We actually were 75/25 at our table of 4,  just like a hung jury in a murder trial I was the lone holdout and said let's carry on.  We struggled through - after convincing her to remake the drinks and a long uncomfortable explanation that she doesn't drink tequila and doesn't know our taste buds... (We didn't care)  I just don't understand the confrontation - we are customers at your establishment, we tasted the drink - it wasn't good.   You need to fix.  I don't want attitude, I don't want explanation of how you make your pre-made margaritas, all I want is friendly service, a good drink and good food.   It is that simple.  You master your craft, I master mine.  It was like the drink was being deducted from her paycheck.  It was just so awful - we had a full view of her conversation with the bartender - which looked like an interesting conversation filled with colorful language about what a great table we were.  Dinner came - it was ok, but because of all the stress it could have been wonderful, we all just wanted to leave.  Our waitress kind of ignored us because we questioned the drinks earlier, so we went without water, additional chips and really any acknowledgement we were human beings.     We wanted out - I wanted to talk to the manager, but I felt so uncomfortable, I felt like it was going to turn into a Dr. Phil episode.  Lopez is like a roller coaster that never seems to end - I have had great experiences, and I have had the worst experiences.  Unfortunately service trumps almost anything, especially in Cleveland where there is so much competition and good food is easy to find.  I love Cleveland Heights and hate to see vacant storefronts but it would not surprise me if one day I see a \"for lease\" sign hanging in the window.    Lopez, you're dead to me.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Not sure why I wasn't a big fan of Lopez back when I originally reviewed it, but I really like it now.  There are multiple vegetarian items clearly labeled on the menu.  (and gluten free options, too!)  If you make it in time for happy hour you can get a pitcher of margaritas on the cheap.  My current favorite entree is the eggplant enchiladas.  You wouldn't normally expect to find eggplant in enchiladas, but it's a really good combo.  I always pair that with some of the vegetarian pinto beans and call it a day with gluttony.  Is it pricier than other palaces?  Sure.  But the food you're getting is a lot better than a 99 cent taco."}
{"text":"Our meals were delicious and service excellent.  The trout was as good as always.  Another excellent meal with good service on their wonderful patio.  A slight problem with the food order was promptly and cheerfully resolved.  Another good meal and service, although the menu has more Tex-Mex varieties  on the printed menu and different choices on the daily specials.  The old menu was better."}
{"text":"Well... We went again and loved it. I've been to Rick Bayless' Fronterra  in Chicago and I've had fish tacos everywhere from Florida to California. My wife grew up in Texas. We've had southwestern cuisine all over the place and Lopez is fun and delicious.  The haters will hate the prices but c'mon... $7 for a soft shelled crab taco is too much? Go to Taco Hell or get to know your porcelain after a visit to ChIChis. I like the margaritas (not like Gatorade, ahem!) and the wait staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Everything was okay. The servers are friendly but the service wasn't great, the food was generously portioned but nothing was knock-your-socks-off good. Same goes for the drinks - everything was a bit generic and nothing special. I'd come back but not before looking for a better option."}
{"text":"Great for groups and a nice atmosphere. The food is great no complaints there. The service was not good at all. Our waitress seemed spaced out barely checked on us and seemed confused when a simple question was asked. We all ordered fajitas which were very tasty but simple and nothing over the top.  Did not like the margaritas at all, they tasted like a mix made straight from a bottle. They did have a summer special watermelon margarita which was delicious and refreshing for the season.  We have gone here a couple of times and have always enjoyed the food but hoped for more on the margaritas and service"}
{"text":"I have also been here twice so far.  The 1st time was super fun, sat at the bar during happy hour (1/2 off all tequila which is amazing and the cucumber margarita was super tasty), and then transferred to a table outside.  I got the mahi mahi tacos and they were very fresh and clean tasting.  Then I went back on a sunday (also a happy hour day) and got a god awful margarita (just the regular kind), seriously undrinkable and the mahi mahi tacos again, but this time they were like swimming in oil.  They waitress was super nice and could see that something was not right, mistake I guess, a bunch of oil spilled on the plate and fixed things for me right away, but the tacos weren't the same as the last time.  Oh well, I would definitely go back, not the most authentic mexican, but serves it's purpose and if you are jonesing for south of the border type food they could semi-satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"Lopez initially allures with its red neon sign and suitably dark decor. Inside, it's loud and colorful without being garish, and the servers are quite pleasant. On a recent Friday at 7pm, however, there wasn't a wait, a fact that should have worried your reviewer. Sadly, I was lost somewhere and didn't consider it. Our party was seated briskly and given our complementary chips and salsa--which were no-frills but tasty enough, at least until we reached the bottom of the chip bag (or half bag--one rather wonders what happens to the upper half (one guest suggested they're kept on-hand as party hats)) to discover the bulk of the chips were so horribly smashed they looked like a kid had gone at them with a claw hammer. Then came the guacamole with lobster which was dreadfully under-salted and tasted of nothing but the sea. I was stunned by the brininess of each bite. Next, the steak and bleu cheese burrito which seemed oddly stale and overly cheesy (bleu cheese must accent--not be used in a great sticky mass like mozzarella). Though the meat was well-seasoned, the price tag ($17) was absurd--one could get a fresher, tastier burrito at Bakersfield or some decadent tacos at Barrio for a fraction of the price. Lastly, the margaritas were stunningly weak and generic. It pains me not to recommend Lopez, as the decor and service are superb. A restaurant's prowess begins and ends with its food, however, and in a crowded market of high end Mexican food, Lopez simply doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The food never disappoints, and the staff is always friendly. Great sugar-free margaritas too, the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Oh Lopez. I find your prices to be PRETTTTTTTTY steep. Regardless, you've got some solid things going for you. First off, the margarita happy hour and fancy flavor options. That combined with the patio is the summer is a winning combination! Second, the server. He was very friendly, and accommodating with all our \"more chips!\" requests. Third, the creativity. While they had the usual appetizers any Mexican place has, theirs were amped up. Guac with blue cheese, caviar, or bacon? YES PLEASE! Fourth, overall atmosphere. Very classy casual, you know? Didn't feel out of place, but also didn't feel like I had to try and impress.   I want to note as well that they have parking off to the side, but it's limited. So... Maybe not bank on parking there. So that's that, only two complaints (price and limited parking) from me! I have plans to definitely return once I have more money, since the entrees look delicious. I only had the opportunity to try appetizers and margaritas my first visit!"}
{"text":"After we paid for parking out front, the hostess sat us with menus and got drinks we were finally informed that they don't serve food for another hour! Went there at 4:30 for happy hour. We left because we were so hungry. The waiter was explaining it to us, said sorry and the hostess was laughing as we walked out the door."}
{"text":"Who orders a bourbon flight at a Mexican reaturaunt...this guy....couldn't turn down the opportunity to try some whiskey and see what they had to offer...they didn't disappoint...goat cheese fondito was amazing and highly recommend it...i had the ruben burrito and it was very good...wish it had more thousand island dressing but overall very tasty...my fiance got tacos.. she started with the ahi tuna which was good...not a favorite of mine but she liked it...next was the shrimp which was very good and i would order it. Last she had the carnitas which i love and honestly suprised when she ordered them...if chiplote was the first place you had carnitas these will blow your mind...sooo full..soo tasty"}
{"text":"The food is good but the price point is high. Drinks are fairly expensive and the white sangria tasted more like a Bellini than a sangria. I will say the brisket taco along with the mushroom tacos were amazing. The fajitas were delicious with large portions, probably the only thing worth the price.  Guacamole trio wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"The only reason I can justify even giving Lopez a single star is because I felt bad for our waitress, who was nice but even the service was mediocre. If only I could say the same for the food, but quite frankly, mediocre would be a compliment. Not one single person in our group enjoyed their food, the nicest things anyone could say was \"it was alright\". I guess I could also say that the portion size was large, but that's basically irrelevant if it doesn't taste good...which it didn't. I had the chicken fajitas, and I couldn't even bite through several pieces of chicken. I'd say it was comparable to attempting to chew a catcher's mitt. I took the majority of the chicken home to give to my dog, and when I tried to break it into smaller pieces for him  there were several chunks of meat that I didn't want to feed him because it was so tough. Super disappointing, and the prices?! Really!?!? I don't mind paying more money for good quality ingredients and food that is so good it will leave me craving it days later...but none of that can be said for the food we had at Lopez. Despite the other negative reviews, I went into this experience with an open mind and really hoped that this place would impress, but it failed miserably."}
{"text":"Good food, Great drinks. cozy enviorment. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"Thought the food was uninspired.  everything was cookie cutter mex.  guacamole was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"Forward: Only went here for a drink. Its a fun atmosphere, the beers on tap are all \"mexican-themed\" so dont expect any GLBC, but Dos Equis to your heart's content.  Its a nice place, with so-so prices on drinks. And thats all about that."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos and the white peach margaritas are really good. There was live music, which made the restaurant a little loud, but it also gave the place a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Lopez is your best bet for margaritas on the east side - hands down.  Reviews will accurately point out that they can be pricy, but happy hour can help a lot.  But even if you're paying full price, you're getting a great choice of flavors if that's your thing - mango, watermelon, blood orange, jalapeno....  Taco varieties are high end and really good.  The prices might seem high, buy the tacos are stuffed.  1 or 2 will do it. BMF burritos are BMFers and, in my opinion, worth the price.  Complimentary chips and salsa are good.  The guacamole is only ok.  You'd expect something kick ass here, but you won't get it.  Decor, vibe and service are great.  Awesome and picturesque patio for the nice weather is a big bonus.  Valet only parking, though is a bit of a drag."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick drink before a movie at the Cedar Lee.  Bartender hooked us up!  We got a pitcher of margarita at happy hour price.  It was good and potent.  They appreciated that we were in a hurry, so after sucking down that pitcher, they hurried the check to us.  A++++++ service!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here after noticing Lopez every time I visited Dewey's next door. I thought to myself, any restaurant that's next to the greatness that is Dewey's has got to be good! I was a little disappointed however. Lopez has a nice ambiance and the staff and service are all around great. I appreciate the constant supply of chips and salsa when you enter (seriously, they waste no time in getting you to eat!) However, the entrees were just okay. I've tried the butter poached lobster tacos and I found the lobster meat just a little heavy on the rubber for my taste and overall just not extraordinarily flavorful. I've also tried the wild mushroom and felt the same way. It was pretty good, just not so good to make me want it again. Everyone at our table came away feeling similarly. Overall, not a super delicious experience, but I might be back to try the mojitos."}
{"text":"Avoid the negative reviews here. They are simply incorrect and those people clearly are picky af.   Atmosphere: definitely an eclectic Mexican spot. Great margaritas (the happy hour is killer). They provide chips and salsa and you can definitely tell the salsa is freshly made. I had the queso and it was soooo delicious melt in your mouth. My entree was the southwestern Rueben burrito and holy moly was I in heaven. The grits served with it were perfection. The courses were served perfectly as I hate feeling rushed.   5 stars. Will return."}
{"text":"I am here on a business trip ,A fellow traveler recommended this place . Food was pretty good. I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised with the innovative menu . Smoked trout and beef brisket tacos were excellent . I had a sampler of salsas they were all de-lish . I took 2 bottles home .  A minor draw back was the waiter ,nice guy ,we just felt a little abandoned when a larger group came in. This doesn't effect the rating .All in all a good foodie destination if you are the Cleveland heights hood ."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  Came in for a margarita and a shot of tequila with the hubs.  Brian, the bartender, made a really great quality Herradura Margarita and my hubs said the mojito was fab.  Chips and salsa hit the spot with the alcohol munchies.  Will return, but maybe just to drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the fajitas here and my boyfriend could eat a bath tub full of their salsa. Other food is ok but we really come here for the fajitas. Atmosphere is cozy and relaxing especially on the patio. The wait staff here is fantastic and we have never been disappointed by them. (Virginia and Bridget are the best!)"}
{"text":"Food was very very good.. Great southwestern menu.. Dont expect your run of the mill Mexican.. But we were very pleased.. The guac was great!! The pickled veggies that came on the Guac sampler were outstanding also.. I had the Flank Steak fajitas and they were great!! My wifes pigfire burrito with the caritnas was very good also.. Black beans were outstanding!!! Over all a very good experience.. Our server was great also... We will definately be back"}
{"text":"OK Im a 30 year veteran of Los Angeles Mexican food, so first off, this really isnt mexican. Its mexican inspired food. BUT ITS REALLY GOOD FOOD. Have the soup. They make REALLY great soup. I had one of their \"tacos\" - this was a wolfgang puck sort of a taco definately not a east LA taco. And again  - it was really great food. Im just drawing a clear distinction between whats served here and whats mexican because if you want mexican, this isnt the place for you. If you want a really nice dining experience with some very interesting and yummy foods, then this is your place."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Lopez before a show at Cain Park. The server was a little backed up so we had to wait a while for drinks and food, but the manager went way above and beyond to make sure we were happy and got to our show on time. The food was delicious and my watermelon mojito was great!"}
{"text":"Skip this place. Definitely not one of the better mex places. We ordered fajitas and the mushroom burger.  Both were very bland and quite boring.  We also had margaritas which tasted as if they were poured from a mix.  Considering that there were a substaintial amount of people in the place, they must just go for atmosphere and convenience.  At this price range there are SO many other great places, like Momocho in Ohio city.  If you are stuck in the area of town near Lopez, go to Melt.  If you are looking for a great meal, trust me, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for just ok food. I was disappointed, as this is one of my favorite types of cuisines, and there aren't many restaurants like this in the area. I'm happy to pay up for a good meal, but I just can't justify going back to this place to pay their  high prices that don't match the quality of the food. Also, I love guacamole, but we tried the lobster guacamole and it was TERRIBLE! Both my date and I were pretty disgusted by it and didn't finish it."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times over 18 months - here are some of my impressions of the place.   This is my place to go to for wonderful margaritas!  Pricey, yes, but I don't think there is any other place nearby that you can get such well made and unique flavored margaritas.  Plus, you can get them half price during happy hour (Sunday-Thursday).  I never thought I would get a Hibiscus margarita in Cleveland.  As for service - it can be a little too attentive at times.  There was one time the owner or manager visited our table 3 times to check in.  But, I can appreciate that he is concerned with customer service.  My favorite server is Terry.  He is very considerate and excellent at what he does.  A wonderful guy!  The hosts have never been haughty to me, as other commenters have experienced.  They all are pretty young, but friendly.  I am not a fan of the valet, and think it is kind of funny.  But, you know what, I just don't use it.  I park across the street in the garage.  If someone wants that kind of high end valet experience, they can have it.    Foodwise, I like the place, but it does not knock my socks off, especially at the price point.  BUT, lets face it, Cleveland is not THE place for Mexican/Tex Mex food.  As for me, I love Mexican/Tex Mex street food and have had the fortune of living where the good stuff is.  DO NOT come to Lopez if you expect authentic Mexican street food.   Lopez offers a more inventive approach to this cuisine.  I would even say that they offer food to a more bland palette, which, in my experience, is consistent with the clientele of the area.  I enjoy their calamari as it is very well seasoned and not fried.  I enjoy most of their tacos too, although often they are underseasoned.  The lobster taco was just ok.  Again, it just wasn't seasoned enough, so it tastes like nothing. I appreciate their flavor combos of their tacos, just wish their were better seasoned.  Their enchiladas are good too.  Again, my socks are not knocked off, but it is the best I have found in the region.  So, while this place is a little spendy, you get wonderful drinks, a nice ambiance (bathrooms need an overhaul, though), attentive and copious staff, and good unique food.  And, if you want, you don't even have to park your car.  A solid place in the neighborhood for me."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight with our toddler. He loves beans and rice, but when the waiter brought the rice, it was spoiled and sour. We asked the server as well as the manager to try the rice.  Instead, they replaced the rice and told us that they threw the whole batch away. It's nice to know that serving spoiled and sour rice is okay in this establishment."}
{"text":"Not cool to seat diners 15 mins before kitchen closes-- rushed order, rushed eating = not returning. However, loved our cocktail from our Bartender, super nice and friendly young guy...."}
{"text":"Horrible... steak fajitas over cooked, gazpacho so hot it was inedible.  Service slow.  Atmosphere nice but I will not come back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and totally average.  Two good things about this place are the friendly service and the outdoor seating.  Came here on a Saturday night without reservations around 9pm and was seated immediately in the outdoor area. Was immediately digging the ambiance and liked the swift placement of chips and salsa which were free. The experience went down hill from here.  I'm a big margarita fan so I order the Gold margarita which is supposed to have better tequila and be less sour according to our waitress. My wife orders the regular. Get the ritas and take a sip and my wife nails the taste perfectly \"like gatorade and tequila.\" Except you can barely taste the tequila. These margaritas are WAY TOO SWEET. The gold was barely tolerable the regular was an absolute joke/nightmare. All you get is unbearable sweetness follow but a sour taste.  Anyway had the Iron chef guacamole. Wife liked it but I didn't. IMO just has way too many flavors going on. Guac is already a complex taste why add blue cheese, bacon and sage? I don't get it. Like tasting 10 things at once.   We shared the chicken enchiladas. They were OK. Nothing great and overall not too flavorful. If they were 10 bucks I would feel OK about them but for 18.5 they did not even come with rice and beans and I was feeling robbed. I am coming from NYC and even we don't pay this for enchiladas at a nice Mexican place.  Between my wife and I had two margaritas, iron chef quac and shared the chicken enchiladas. Bill came to about $55 with tip!!! No thanks."}
{"text":"Cleveland is a cesspool of Mexican/Southwest restaurants that all have different names, but the exact same menus with the same crappy ingredients. Does nobody else notice this?? People actually argue which ones are better, without realizing that IT'S ALL THE SAME GARBAGE. And all of their margaritas consist of tequila, bottom shelf triple sec and sour mix, with maybe a little lime (or whatever fruit you want) juice squirted in. Sour mix does not belong in a margarita. It's filler. It's the pink slime of margaritas.   But not at Lopez. The margaritas at Lopez are the best I have ever tasted, with real, high quality ingredients. \"Not as good as Momocho,\" you say? You're wrong. Momocho has terrific margaritas, but they are a close second to Lopez. Bourbon is my poison, but a Lopez blood orange margarita would be an impossible cocktail to turn down if given a choice between the two.   On to the food. The chips are perfect, and I enjoyed the salsa. Salsa is like pickles. Some people like dill pickles, some like sweet. There are the weirdos who eat bread & butter pickles, and some people absolutely hate salt-brined pickles - which ironically is the true kosher pickle. Anyway, the point is that every person likes their salsa prepared differently. Lopez's salsa is on the watery side (I do prefer it thicker), but the flavor was very good. They have a great selection of tasty guacs as well if watery salsa truly offends you. The smoked brisket enchiladas is a huge portion of tender brisket and flavorful sauces that combine perfectly. The night we went, there was some kind of habanero soup on special and I went for it. Great idea. Wow. I wish I knew when they were serving it again.   So stop ordering the #104 Speedy Gonzalez at your favorite crappy restaurant and try something original at Lopez. The food and drinks are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, and a nice atmosphere to boot. The bar is impressive, and they patio is one of my favorites. Go there and at least have a margarita. Or four margaritas, and a cab."}
{"text":"This place was terrible... way over priced and the food made me feel ill when I left.  The margaritas are nothing to talk about... not very good at all and the amount you get for a $17 dish is not worth the lack of quality or the ambience (which there isn't much of).  I was seated in the very back and our waitress seemed to have a stick up her butt.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I always want to like this place. Unfortunately the food is mediocre. This may be the reason the drinks are so strong."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Appetizers were good, entrees were alright?  We started off with the guac trio- iron chef guac, goat cheese fundido, and the house chorizo. I definitely liked the iron chef guac- there's a reason why it's called iron chef. haha.  The drinks were half off, so my friend tried the raspberry  margarita(which was good) and I tried the cactus. Why not, right? I'm not sure what cactus is suppose to taste like..but it was good?  For entrees, she got the pork al pastor. Mmmmmm. Her pork tacos were so well seasoned and good. I recommend that, totally. I got the lobster enchilada per suggestion of our waiter. It was..... okay? I mean, it was definitely an enchilada. And the lobster was a little tough....but at least, it's a cool item on the menu.  It's a cool place to hang out though- I walked in, and instantly, the individuals who greeted me were over the top-friendly, laughing and being happy. The waiter was great as well, talking to us, instead of acting business-like. I liked the people there, for sure....maybe I need to give the entrees another try? Or maybe just get the tacos and guac......."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty nice - it definitely made me feel that I was in a nice restaurant.   Our waitress was super helpful and nice. She was very honest with everything and she refilled our chips and salsa in lightening speed! I was just telling my boyfriend to stop eating too much chips cuz he's gonna get full then the waitress came around to refill our chips again and teased him: you dont wanna stuff yourself full before the main course! LOL Other waiters in the restaurants were very polite and nice as well.  Regarding the food/drinks, I really liked my peach mojitos. It was very well made. It was a giant 12+ fl oz drink for only $8 and a beer is only $4! I would definitely come back for more! We ordered puffy tacos for appetizer. The veal was very tendered and yummy, but overall it was ok. The presentation was not very nice. I ordered grilled skirt steak enchiladas for entree and the steak was definitely awesome and well done but the sauce could need some improvement. DESSERT - we had this baked mexican chocolate. It was SO GOOD! It's a giant melted chocolate with cookies chunks inside with a square-shaped cookie, some whipped cream, and seasoned strawberries on top. It was amazing. soft and gooey yet chewying at the same time. THEN you will have the spicy after taste. It was a great dessert. Highly recommended.  Valet parking was only $3 and the dude was super nice and helped us scrap off the snow on the car. The only complaint I had for this restaurant was its price - for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert and 2 drinks, we spent around $85 including tips and tax. It was a little higher than what I expected to pay for this place."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot. The margaritas are amazing and come in a bunch of flavors from (my personal favorite -) strawberry to  jalapeño. Plus the complementary chips are served with some the most delicious fresh salsa ever. I've been to Lopez after work for the half priced drinks a dozen times now and have always had great service. The staff really knows the menu and makes you a priority no matter how busy the place is, and everything has always been very clean.  As far as the food, it's hit or miss. There's no chicken option for anything, including the tacos, which is hard for someone like myself who doesn't eat red meat. However there are fish choices which have all been pretty great and some A+ guacamole."}
{"text":"Great drinks, nice outdoor seating, pricey menu.  The overall feel of the restaurant is great.  A wonderful date spot.  The GF loved it."}
{"text":"In an effort to try to explore more things in our new neighborhood, we stopped in to Lopez.  It was slightly busy, but easy to get a table.  Good sign.  We got a very helpful waiter who explained the menu and made some recommendations for us.  We decided to order two flavors of margaritas - pomegranate and jalapeno.  The pomegranate was sweet and fruity, and the husband's jalapeno was very spicy!  Very good!  We decided on a taquito-like appitizer with black beans that they called the rolled cigars or something and the tacos (and were required to order at least two tacos each.)  All the selections we made were pretty tasty - some were better than others and I would recommend the shrimp and lobster tacos.    For my second drink the waiter recommended a prickly pear cactus margarita that wasn't on the menu yet - really, really good! Definitely recommend that one.  So, if everything was pretty good, why only 3 stars?  Because after an appetizer, 4 tacos and 3 margaritas, our bill was $70. We left feeling like \"those tacos were good, but not for $6-8 each!\" so I don't know if we will be going back."}
{"text":"About a month ago I decided to drive back home after work, but to travel 271 North, then westbound on Cedar. I ended up on Lee and wanted to try Lopez. The atmosphere is classy. The staff was very friendly. I thought the food was decent and expensive. The tacos are $6. This is a lot of money for a taco even if you are rich. The company that I shared at the bar was terrific. Everyone was very warm and friendly. I really enjoyed myself at Lopez. I honestly would return solely for the grits. They are some of the best grits that I have had. There is smoked gouda in it. I saved the other half of it for breakfast the next day. If you do want to try out Lopez, please, try the grits. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I've never written a review of any restaurant in my life but after eating at Lopez last night I felt compelled to do so. The cost to taste ratio was completely not worth it. Mushroom tacos: disgusting. The marinade had an overwhelming vinegar flavor which honestly is not the best pairing with refried beans and to top it off- the tortilla shell was so thin&soggy it disintegrated, spilling the contents onto the plate. That said: I enjoyed the skinny margarita which is why I gave Lopez 2 stars instead of 0."}
{"text":"30 years ago when my parents took me to the original Lopez y Gonzalez I thought that mexican food was the greatest thing ever invented.  In fact the original impact has continued to set the standard for all mexican restaurants ever since.  I say all that to explain that it's a sad day when you cannot live up to you're own standards and I'm afraid that Lopez does not.  In my opinion mexican food should be both rustic and flavorful.  Lopez has decided to take a cuisine with humble beginnings and tried elevated to the level of fine dining, losing all the elements that makes mexican food special.  If you are looking for a tasty fusion restaurant with mexican roots then Lopez is a nice choice."}
{"text":"Food: The meal started off right with a brown bag of slightly salty chips and flavourful chunky salsa. I ordered tacos (You have to order at least 2). I got 2 of the pulled pork and 1 of the brisket (per a foursquare tip). The tacos were large! Most people will be fine with 3 - definitely 4! They are thick - really stuffed with amazing ingredients. Large portions seem to be a trend. My friend got the BMF Burrito which was larger than a Chipotle one and just as stuffed. There is a good happy hour on Tuesdays from 5-9. You get 1/2 off margaritas - they have 13 flavours and oh so many tequila options (hence the \"Tequila Saloon\" bit in their name).   Service: Our waitress was helpful in making menu decisions, friendly, checked-in on us as much as we would have wanted, and refilled our chips/salsa without being asked. She was friendly and unlike some restaurants where patio diners are forgotten about, she was just as attentive as any indoor server I have ever had.   Location: There is a metered parking garage that takes credit card across the street. Also there is valet; on Tuesday night it cost $3.   Environment: The inside of the restaurant is not special, but the outdoor patio is simply charming! I loved it! There is a small tree in the center and from it and all around the patio are lights. It looks very inviting. For those chilly nights they have portable heaters. Chairs/tables were comfy, didn't rock or wobble, and are set out allowing for a spacious private feel on the patio. Just don't try to exit from the patio gate - it's chained shut. There are also some booths indoors right next to windows that open so you can have the best of both worlds in those seats.   Overall Recommendation: I was walking Lee Road at about 9pm and wanted food. I saw the 3-star average rating of this place and almost didn't go inside, but the patio was full and a good number of inside tables were as well. That was more than could be said for nearby restaurants, so despite others' low rating, I went in and was very glad I did! If you can get in earlier for happy hour definitely do so, otherwise anytime is worth while."}
{"text":"I am a west sider. And for those of you who are true Clevelanders, you know there is a great divide. For me the east side of Cleveland is kind of weird, it has a totally different vibe. But Lopez could make me convert to an east sider.   When you go, make sure you get a table on the patio. I could live on that patio. When it gets chilly they provide blankets for your laps and put out heat lamps. It's sooo nice.   Their food is amazing. For apps, you can't go wrong with any of their guacamole's or the goat cheese fundido. The \"fluffy\" chips that come with the fundido may be my favorite thing. All of their tacos deserve a five star review, but for me, the buttered poached lobster taco steals the show. Could there be anything more heavenly?? No. The tacos are huge, by the way, and the portion of lobster you get is substantial.   If tacos aren't your style, their burritos and enchiladas are delicious as well. Or if you are preferring a liquid diet ;), the tequila flights and house cocktails will fit the bill. I couldn't love this place more than I do. Treat yourself!!"}
{"text":"Please offer smaller portions at lower prices.  The food is great but just too much and too expensive. Being able to order just one taco would be a great idea and possibly have smaller entrees too."}
{"text":"Lopez has been and conitinues to be one of my top 3 Mexican inspired restaurants in Cleveland (Momocho & Barrio are the other two).  The food is great, outdoor sitting amazing in the summer and drinks are always strong.  The softshell crab taco and lobsters tacos are always a great choice when in season."}
{"text":"Dishes were good, not spectacular. The service was very good. Our server was very attentive.   The guac was good but nothing really to scream out loud about.   The fish tacos were good but could use more flavor.   The chocolate mousse was very thick and sweet. It didn't really have enough chocolate flavor. I preferred the chocolate soufflé in the mug. The creme brûlée was also very good.   The mojitos were very weak. All limes and mint and no liquor.  Be sure to ask them to make it stiff."}
{"text":"Our server brought us drinks and failed to return to our table to take our food order.  After a half hour, we got up and left to make our movie time. I've never seen a server just forget about a table like that.  She wasn't busy either, we looked over at her a couple times and she was just standing by the bar staring blankly into space. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Dangit, why do I revisit perfection?  When I had the grits in December, they were fabulous.  So this time, I ordered three to go.  Got home, taste no smoked gouda and the grits are just eh.  But since Lopez is closed and I am leaving town tomorrow, I'm stuck.  Maybe I'll buy some smoked gouda and liven them up.  Disappointed.  Shame on me for waiting til the last minute and for setting myself up."}
{"text":"I love Lopez.  Yes, it's pricier than your average Mexican restaurant.  But in my opinion it is totally worth it.  The servers are very friendly.  I had a goat cheese & portabella quesadilla and it was TO DIE.  They have a good selection of tequila.  Also, I highly recommend ordering a guacamole flight, they have one with bacon in it!"}
{"text":"Food is so so.. service is pretty great. Chip and salsa was the best. Poutine fries was ok. Had their rueben burrito. It's huge but taste can be improved."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get quality Mexican cuisine in Cleveland. Went with my family on a Saturday night and they were able to seat us right away. The drinks are always fantastic, especially the specialty margaritas; they actually taste like real drinks, not just sugar mixed with alcohol.  The food is always great, too! I tried something a little different and I loved it! The eggplant enchiladas we really tasty and fresh.  Service was a bit slow at times (our waitress seemed to have a lot of tables) but they were all very kind and welcoming. Great environment for parties of all sizes and ages. Looking forward to grabbing a drink or meal here again soon!"}
{"text":"Liked the appetizer. The half price margarita turned out to be limited to two options and the glass was small. Usually you get triple the quantity for a good price in a lot of Mexican restaurants. My steak fajita was awful! Was a fatty piece of steak that I couldn't even chew! Not going back there!!!"}
{"text":"I had the mole chicken. The sauce was great!  The drinks seemed a little light on the alcohol. But a great place with lots of action."}
{"text":"If I was reviewing the salsa and chips this place would get 10 stars. The freebie salsa and chips at this place are so addicting. And the server just kept on bringing more and more and more. It was fantastic. We also ordered some guac, which was good, but not really anything special.  Hubs had the enchiladas and I had the fajitas. The food was pretty good. I really liked the mole sauce that came on the enchiladas. Overall, I would definitely go back to hang out and get some drinks and chips/salsa. I would eat here again, but I wouldn't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Let me make an addendum....they have half-off tequila drinks on Tuesdays\Thursdays and discounted mojitos on another night (I think Friday?) Again, this is nice, but why no food discounts?  Went there last night and had a blast...enjoyed a half-off Cactus Margarita and a seemingly never-ending stream of chips and salsa. I just came back from Mexico, and the salsa here at Lopez is pretty darn close to what we had down there. Hence, I made like Edmund in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe with Turkish Delight and ate a ton!  One other thing that I didn't mention in the original review is that the music at this place is wonderful--they played plenty of Dido last night, as well as some smooth jazz-esque music. Plus, in the summer, Lopez has one of the area's best patios!"}
{"text":"YUM. Any place that uses a ton of goat cheese in their food is A-OK in my book!  2 friends and I finally made it out to Lopez last night. One girl had been there plenty of times, but the other one and I had been meaning to try it for weeks! We were immediately seated after getting there and they brought by some chips and salsa. The chips came out in mini paper bags, which was super cute. The chips were delicious. the salsa was more of a pico de gallo, super mild. So, we added their \"gorilla\" hot sauce from the bottles on the table to it and it added a kick.   Our waiter came by to get our drink orders and once he realized we were all perusing the marg menu, he commented that every marg was half off and if we were all getting the same thing- to just get a pitcher! UH-mazing -  a 45 dollar pitcher for 22??? YES please! Most places I go to with HH usually don't discount pitchers. Anyways, we got a pitcher of the golden marg and it was wonderful. Tart and a bit sweet, but strong and delicious!   We decided to start with some guacamole and goat cheese fundido. They were both AMAZING. I've been to many-a-mexican restaurants where the guac comes out tasteless and I end up adding salsa and salt to it. But, this one was great! And the goat cheese fundido... MMM.... came with some fresh fried tortilla triangles. just YUMMY.   For an entree, I got the Angry Hippie burrito, which came with smoked gouda and jalapeno grits and a pickled slaw. The burrito was pretty good! Had portabello mushrooms, eggplant, goat cheese, and arugula. The portion was huge. I came home with 3/4 of the burrito! (Part of that may have been due to my overindulgence of chips, salsa, goat cheese fundido, and guac!) But it was pretty darn big. I am not a fan of grits usually - these tasted ok in my opinion, my friends liked them, but I've just never been a fan. The slaw was pretty good, but I love anything pickled :)   The service was pretty good. Our waiter was super friendly and funny. The girl who kept bringing our various dishes out was also super friendly. She talked to us for a bit about the menu and was very helpful when we asked about different entrees we were thinking about ordering. There was  a loooooong period of time while we were eating our apps, where our waiter was MIA. Our apps were pretty much cleared before he even came by to take our dinner orders. But, once we noticed how quick the food actually came out after it was ordered, we figured it was purposely done that way.  As far as price goes, I agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned that yes... it is expensive but you go there knowing the prices - they have them listed on the menu. It's not your average greasy mex place (which I LOOOOOVE too)- so yes, prices are higher. But, in my opinion the quality and the portions make it worth it. (but no, I don't know if 7 to 11 dollars for a single taco is necessary worth it in my book)  Overall, we had a good experience and I will definitely be returning again to drink some more margs and try some different things on the menu :)"}
