{"text":"Love the layout of this place! Very spacious, great patio. A refreshing change for Old Town. We went for the first time last night and the bartender, Jimmy, was great. They have a good selection of Chicago and local beers. I can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"This is out third time at BOSS pizza and we are still thoroughly impressed. Their service is impeccable. I'd put their pizza up against any in town, it is that good! Wings=awesome! Nacho's=uniquely awesome! Vegi Balls, whaaaaa? Get an order of any of the balls, they are tasty. Want a beer? They have two bars that looked well stocked and TVs around the bar so you can watch the games. Very kid friendly and their kids menu cannot be beat anywhere in town. Try it once and you'll be back again and again. Perfect for bday parties and after the game parties on their huge open patio with misters. Best kept secret in Scottsdale is BOSS pizza!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Mothers day.Dining area very warm they did turn the air on but it took awhile before it cooled down.Food was not the greatest,the arinachi balls were very dry.I will give it another try could have been an off day.Everyone has had an off day"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and this is a great place to try!  Hubs and I had wings and they were wonderful. Our vegetarian daughter had the meat hater pizza and loved it. Great location to catch a game or have a meal without a dj blaring in your ears. TV's everywhere with games to follow. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just off the beaten path in old town this is a great new spot for pizza and drinks. The patio is huge and perfect place to enjoy good weather (they should add misters for the hotter months). There are some unique pizza combos and good craft beer ($4 on happy hour). Good for kids and large groups. Overall great food and service on our first 2 visits -  I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Really great open atmosphere and real Chicago pizza!  This is a must try for the foodies in Old Town!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Saturday to watch the Ryder Cup and enjoy their weekend specials. We had the jalape√±o ranch pizza($10 special) and the cheeseburger($7 special). Both were very tasty, and $3 bloody Mary's and $4 craft draws make this the perfect place to watch the games. And our bartender/server was awesome!  10/8/2017: Update: Showed up to watch some football around 11am and the place was closed. Yelp and their website said they are open 11-9 but not today."}
{"text":"Had several items in menu and all were great! Staff was great. Huge patio and good beer selection."}
{"text":"Not \"typical\" pizza. They have styles that are a little different. Highly recommend the cheeseburger pizza. Their salads looked good too. This place has a great dog friendly patio. Would be a great place for a large family gathering this holiday.  They are off the beaten path but worth getting off Scottsdale road. Btw I see bad reviews from two months ago. I talked to the new GM and I think there must have been an issue. Service was awesome"}
{"text":"The Owner Tony has a winning concept here, to offer non-traditional Pizza Salads and Sandwiches that are great tasting and innovative, they have the old standbys as well but their gourmet pies will blow you away, the Baked Potato Pizza is a must try, when you close your eyes you think your eating a stuffed Potato with all the trimmings!  Another key about this concept, is Service, downtown Scottsdale service has been laxed at Boss Pizza Bar these employees will keep you services and make your meal so much more enjoyable.  Check them out they have a huge place 10,000 sq feet 5,000 inside and 5,000 in an awesome patio.  They cater and have plenty of room for office parties even weddings.... @ huge bars that serve anything you want."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot in Old Town.  It was a welcome surprise. Great craft beers, unique pizza selections and couldn't have asked for better service.  Can't wait for NFL season, this place is totally equipped for all the games."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my roommate to grab a couple beers while doing homework and watching the game. We had David as our server/bartender and he was great! Although it was quiet for Monday night football, they had great TVs, great wifi, and great specials m so I am sure their business will pick up as others in the area discover this spot. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just finishing a meal here.  The food was decent and the service was good, but a little slow.  We had two families with a total of 8 people.  Sat down at 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Not crowded at all.  Had a certificate that I showed to the server, he took my phone and a few minutes later came back and said the owner had never heard of it.  It was a legit source and well known; I have pics to back it up.  The owner came out after two requests to speak with him. I simply wished to show him the source and that it was legit.  It was only $25 on a $125 total bill.  He became belligerent that he would never use that as a promo and has never talked to them, following up asking me if I had called them.  I said no, I was trying to enjoy a meal with friends. It went on the same for a few more minutes.  It ended with me telling him that he had just lost customers.  My friends marveled that I was polite and calm the entire time also if you are wondering about my temperament. Too bad really, it could have been so much different.  All for $25.  We ended up zeroing out the tip to compensate, because as I told him,  now I have to try to recover my $25 from the source. It's not the money, it's the principle.  Ironically, I received an email from the source while I was there asking me how it was.  I guess I have anther review to write. He could have honored it, and dealt with the source tomorrow.  Final verdict; don't give this guy your money.  Other places have better atmosphere and better food without a jerk for an owner."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 15 minutes waiting for a drink. Bartender looked at me and asked how long have you been waiting. I respond with, 15 minutes or so. He asked, why didn't you wave me down. I asked, isn't your responsibility to know what's going at your bar or is it your responsibility to speak to your bros."}
{"text":"I had the gluten-free pizza and my wife had a cheeseburger... the food was outstanding!. Dog friendly atmosphere and Danny our waiter was the best!!! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were in town shopping and left the mall hungry, so we were looking for a place to grab a bite but all the places on scottsdale rd were more of a bar type restaurant not too family oriented and we have a kid with us so as we were looking for a place were we could bring kids we accidentally stumbled upon this spot. The ambiance the service and the food were all tens!  Kaleb did an awesome job helping us out in picking the right pizza, i highly recommend this place! The wings are BOMB!!"}
{"text":"They only opened a week before we stopped in and we expected them to still be working out the kinks. That wasn't the case - they're ready for primetime. I had a pizza, my girlfriend the enormous grilled cheese. Both fantastic! The service was super friendly and the prices reasonably. They've already moved to the top of my list for pizza in Old Town. Keep up the good work. We'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and salad ... and an ice cold beer! Thank you for hosting our little league team!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and a Caesar salad and the \"salad\" that I ordered came in a box with only 4 pieces of rotten romaine, not edible.  I called to see if I could get a replacement salad or a refund. Employee offered discount for future  order, and I was placed on hold and then hung up on.  Pizza is good, but I would not recommend this restaurant, as there are other options in Scottsdale with much better Customer Service."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 18 year Olds for a birthday. Absolutely awesome patio! Pizza had great flavor and a lot of fun different combos to choose from. They let you do half and half on their specialty pizzas which is great when sharing. Service wad excellent. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a relaxing time in their beautifull green grass setting!  The sausage pizza was very, very good...and the grilled romaine Caesar hit the spot! My husband is a tough critic for good sausage and he thought it was excellent There are many other pizza places nearby but the setting made this extra nice!  As far as \"kids running around\", there was only one family with a small child.  Service was friendly as can be.  Welcome to Old Town, Boss!"}
{"text":"I wanted to call this my new neighborhood pizza joint, it has such a great and relaxing vibe. But for one my tummy hasn't been right for the last three days after our visit. Our pizza was not very good to begin with which is disappointing for a PIZZA bar. The beer was also a bit too warm. Plus side is the very friendly staff and prompt service!"}
{"text":"Went on our daily after noon bike ride with my 16 year old and 12yr old step daughter doing some Pokemon hunting, and came across this place. Its HUGE, like I couldn't get over how sprawled out the place was, and huge courtyard and then tried to imagine how much they pay in rent and how they could afford to do that. Well, I took a look at the menu and figured out how. Way overpriced. $11 for 8 wings, ordered 16\" pizza half Chicago style and the other pepperoni & sausage. I was charged $19 (price for entire Chicago style pizza), and then $2.50 for each topping (pepp & Sausage) thank goodness we only ordered water. Our bill was $38+. Our waitress Jill was phenomenal. Great personality.      Major downside of this place, since it's in a gated courtyard, there were two different families there and they were both letting their kids run wild. One group was playing with the large Jenga blocks, and sending the blocks off the picnic table through the fence, hitting cars parked along street. Kids we're running back and forth (even a small toddler who looks like she just learned to walk, who accidentally was underfoot of waitress, and accidentally knocked the child down, and the mom said it was ok, she'll be fine, one other lady in party gave her dirty look) oh Heck No. I saw the whole thing. Liability liability liability.. Totally distracted from my own family and watched in major disbelief. Get signs made, and posted that unattended children are not allowed. I finally had enough, got on my bike, went to other end where kids were and told them they had better get back and stick close to their family because I had heard  kidnapper was on the loose. Yeah mother of the year award right here.     Just totally ruined my night, and it appeared to be stressing the waitresses and other patrons as well.      And this has happened before, many of times in talking to other people. Owner of Boss, please fix this!!"}
{"text":"About 8:00pm on a Friday, four of us decided to try out this brand new pizza place. Hot wings were tasty the Meat Hater pizza was not bad at all. However the menu was not as thrilling as we thought it'd be. Not to worry, the customer service was on point and they are more than willing to accommodate substitutions. Our waitress Naz was just hired but you could not tell with her experience and politeness. Little pricey though I could see myself returning."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for this place. We came to watch a game and had a great experience. Not only was the food great, but the service was better. Our Server, Alisha, was attentive, pleasant and stayed ahead of our requests. They changed TV channels so everyone could view easily, without us even asking. Not busy at all while we were there, but they should be all the time!"}
{"text":"My very picky eater godson says \"this is the best pizza I've ever had in the whole world!\". Now that's high praise coming from him! And even better, he lives in Chicago so he's had some fantastic pizza before this! I love their salads and nachos too...not your everyday nachos, so unique! And I hate tiny crowded little patios so this huge outdoor eating area is a welcome change!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good and creative. Bar is kind of cool. But, services lacks and definitely over priced. Probably won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We should have known that a restaurant that is virtually empty on a long weekend while other restaurants had a line up is a bad sign.    The food was average once it finally came out.  We waited an hour for our food. A couple of pizzas came out then the salads, pastas and rest of pizzas took an hour.    The wait staff was abysmal.  They didn't bother trying to refresh our drinks or give us chips until our food arrived.  They simply disappeared until so much time had passed that they had to give us our food free of charge.  Our bills took so long too.  What a disaster of a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a good new spot just off Scottsdale Rd. I got the grilled cheese and it was one of the best I've ever had. It is definitely big enough to split or take some home for leftovers. One observation is that it is advertised to come with tomato soup but it is more like marinara sauce -which I prefer to dip my grilled cheeses in - but some people may not like that.   The lunch crowd was a little slow but given it is new and 110 degrees, not a whole lot of people wanted to sit out on the large patio. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"I came in today to give this place a second chance after my first experience was absolutely horrible. Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday not a single customer was in the building. The owner was so rude about it and made no effort to make us feel welcome. We left and went somewhere else.  I suggest you do the same"}
{"text":"Food's good but the service is slow, unless you are a party of two. Like very slow. We had a party of 5 and hadn't gotten anything for an hour. Not even a salad or a piece of bread. We told the waiter we were all starving and he shrugged his shoulders. LOL.  Get the jalapeno ranch pizza, so good; it's why we've been back a couple of times. And the fried chicken sandwich is great.  There's a ton of great places in Old Town and something new opening up every week, so this isn't a place I would revisit knowing how bad the service can be."}
{"text":"Driving home after a meeting from Sip Coffee I noticed Boss Pizza Bar and determined I needed to check this place out.  I called the babysitter and took my wife there for happy hour.  Ordered the buffalo wings as an appetizer (which at half price was a great deal).  In asking the waitress which pizza she suggested between the Baker and the BLT she said we could do Baker on one side and BLT on the other - Sold!  Most artisan pizza joints I have been to don't let you do that; so huge props from me on that.  Pizza was perfectly crispy in the right spots with excellent favors blended together just right.  If I had to chose (which we didn't) I would edge the Baker over the BLT.  The only thing I would change would be an expansion of more drink options for happy hour.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"2 stars for how quick the takeout service was but that's about it. 3, 14inch pizzas to go, almost $60. I'll pay for a good pizza....However.... Each one of them was black or burnt on the bottom. Wiping down the ovens would help stop the burnt bottoms. Taste wise, all 3 were greasy. Had the Chicago, Fat Guy and Muffaleta. Won't be back and cannot recommend it. Never had so much leftover pizza."}
{"text":"BOMB pizza! Tried the Muffalata (?) and BLT and both were delicious! Jimmy at one of the bars made us killer Moscow Mules! Awesome ambience, great space, friendly staff! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I suspect this place is on the verge of going under and after today's experience, that would seem to be for good reason.  In the past, we've ordered the thin crust Meat Hater's pizza with the addition of black olives and found it to be a delicious, fresh mix of ingredients.  We've tried the veggie balls which were also great, but today made the mistake of ordering the Caesar salad as a starter.  Yikes!  What a disgusting and inedible mess!  We missed the notation on the menu that the lettuce was grilled, but nonetheless, taking a head of romaine, cutting it in half and pursuing to turn it into charcoal, topped with some stale croutons and a squeeze-bottle application of some \"dressing\" is an utterly disgusting combination.  We stopped after one bite.  Let's move on to the pizza.  It arrived with kalamata olives rather than the black olives that we had ordered.  Now maybe to some people, an olive is an olive, but these two types of olives have distinctly different flavors.  One belongs on a pizza, the other on a Greek salad.  When I asked our bartender/server, Alisha about this, she insisted these are the same olives they have always had. They certainly are not or we would not have ordered an item that we proceeded to pick off of the pizza due to it's off-putting taste.  Finally, she spoke with the \"chef\" who admitted that these are indeed different olives.  Really???  She politely took the inedible salad and olive upcharge off of our bill for which we were appreciative until we got home and assessed the half of the 16\" pizza that she had crammed into a tiny to-go container.  In the past, we'd taken half of the pizza with us and brought it home in a normal pizza box.  This time, we arrived home and opened a tiny foil container to find a pile of wet, soggy goo.  Alisha had somehow managed to cram an entire half of a 16\" pizza into a shallow, 8\" round foil container by stacking and mashing the pizza into an inedible mass of slimy goo.  Needless to say, there are far better pizza places in Scottsdale that offer consistent food and responsible service.  We've never seen more than a handful of other patrons here at the most and this is likely why. There is no need to waste your money at this place and we certainly will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered take out, 2 pizzas, tonight-first time having been here. The experience from start to finish was great. First-the parking is AMAZING! Second-I was greeted immediately upon my arrival and several more times by several other staff to ensure I had been helped. Everyone was friendly! The place looks cool; it's big w a great courtyard and outdoor bar, lots of seating, good music. I peeked at the happy hour menu while I was waiting; looks like good deals there too.   Brought my pizzas home-both were DELICIOUS!! I had the NY Honey and the Memphis; absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be back-already made plans for happy hour w the girls next week!"}
{"text":"Boss Pizza Bar has an amazing selection of food and beverages. Their wing can be grilled or traditional :sauces are tasty. Pizza can come with different crust and lots of yummy toppings to choose from.   Extremely friendly  Open environment  Amazing Service !"}
{"text":"We didn't have plans this Friday evening and have had a Groupon to Boss Pizza Bar for a few months, and this decided to go by for dinner. The venue itself is very large and welcoming, definitely somewhere to come and hangout during the day or grab dinner and drinks before a night out! We had two pizzas... The Fat Boy and the BLT BOTH were incredibly tasty and had plenty of all the toppings listed! Our server was very friendly and the GM even stopped by to chat, funny guy. We look forward to stopping by her again soon for some good pizza and fun!"}
{"text":"This place is huge, and I went on a Monday night at Primetime!  There might've been ten customers total in the whole place including one table on the patio.  My friend and I ordered an 18' Thin Crust Sausage and Mushroom!  Our server Kristin was extremely fantastic!  No knocks on her whatsoever!  The stars being deducted is for the pizza!  When it arrived I thought to myself where on earth are the mushrooms? Hardly any at all on an 18' pie!  The sauce was next to non existent, so I asked for some on the side!  Bottom line I found the sauce to be extremely flavorless.  The thin crust and quality of the sausage was fine, just sad to be out $40 for a less than stellar pizza and two soft drinks! I hope this place isn't the next Scottsdale casualty in the restaurant(pizza)world, as the competition is fierce!  I'm thinking the ticket is to order items other than a basic pizza!  I'm sure I'll return as I like the vibe, but will get a salad or burger in the future!"}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza was excellent,  they went the extra mile to find our WBC game and a tv for us to watch it on during March Madness"}
{"text":"Used to ride by this place daily on my afternoon commute. Always thought they were just open for dinner because I never saw a soul inside or out. Recently, we've stopped in a few times, weekends for lunch mostly. Their happy hour is OK, but the place is always dead, as in we are the only people in the entire, massive restaurant made of 5 different buildings...  Actual restaurant is nice. Very clean, modern look inside, lots of games and shit outside.  Pizzas are pretty good, but only if you stick to what is normal. They have some odd combinations of toppings, but be careful, because most of them don't work. Last visit, we tried the NY Honey that is always touted by staff and even other patrons. Ick. It doesn't work, sickly sweet and a chore to choke it down. Maybe it would appeal to kids, but you might as well dump  The Jalapeno Ranch and Baker are also not very good. Crust is a good thickness, not too chewy and the sauce and toppings seem to be of decent quality.   Meatballs and wings are pretty solid. Haven't felt compelled to try anything else on the menu, looks very meh.   Beer list is a disaster, and still pricey at $4 on HH. All total shit from Arizona, as is the status quo these days in nearly every hippish restaurant. Good luck finding anything truly appealing here. They do rotate some things time to time, but replacing garbage with trash isn't blowing my skirt up. The quality of their mules is highly dependent on who's behind the bar. You might get lucky and get one that is drinkable.   Overall, worth a look at least once."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is open and fun. The food was terrific, we tried the Baker pizza and it was amazing! For dessert we crushed a delicious pizza cookie with gelato. Truly the best pizza cookie we have had. They have drink specials and a good variety of beer. The only downside is Pepsi products, but if you drink beer and cider you won't even notice"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the boss last night after a 5 hour flight. We sat at the bar with Alyssa and she did a great job recommending some items on the menu. We got the pizza 1/2 fat guy and 1/2 the blt. It was sooooo yummy. Some of the best pizza I have ever had. I love thin crust and they have it down! I can't wait to go back!!! Highly recommend. Great atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza, great atmosphere. I love sitting on the patio with my pals and drinking the beers, awesome selection btw. The vibe is great."}
{"text":"Great for infants, toddlers and kids. Pretty good pizza. Strange nachos.  Nice craft beer and cocktail list. Reasonable prices. Service a bit screwy. But once we got our order in, the pizza came quickly. Crackle think crust. Didn't skimp on the toppings. Fresh spinach and good hunks of meatballs. Super pleasant patio and lawn."}
{"text":"Had to use the bathroom and ended up here for that purpose, but decided to stay for a beer and food to go. It was pretty crowded on a recent Sunday early evening and they could have used another bartender, but I got everything in reasonable amount of time. The beer was $4, but the star of this place was my meatball hero. It was all beef and nestled in a good roll with cheese and some sauce, but they also included a large container of tasty extra sauce in my take-out container. I opted for the $1 sweet potato tots up charge which was a good decision. I really hate Chicago thin pizza which is what this place serves mostly, but the meatball hero is worthy of a return visit. About $12."}
{"text":"My husband won't stop talking about this place. He loves it! Huge space with a lot of potential. The green space in the front with picnic tables is great for families and the open windows to the bar are perfect when you want to reload . Definitely going to spend more time there exploring the affordable menu- the place is boss!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the NY Honey. The manager and staff is very friendly. Hidden gem of Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Check this place out on a warm night. Plenty of tables under lit trees with live music. On a quieter street, Boss is a place with very good pizza and beverages. The craft beer list had some nice options that you don't often see. The pizza is thin, crisp , tasty. The toppings are fun - I loved the spicy muffelata. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Wings were AMAZING! Some of the best I've ever had. However, the double dough pepperoni pizza was flavorless and still pretty thin in my opinion. The grilled romaine Caesar was a miss as well. Would definitely come back for the Wings."}
{"text":"Great pizza off the unbeaten path! Chill outside seating/bar. NY Honey thin crust is a must have. Happy hour specials from 11-6. This place has a lot of potential ! Give it a shot."}
{"text":"At least they didn't put the expired arugula directly on the pizza.  I tried sorting through it but it's all yellow - why would I want to eat that?? The pizza was good, but I'll never go back to a place that thinks serving spoiled food is a good idea."}
{"text":"Really fun place.  Great outdoor sitting.  We had our tball party here and it went really well.  They staff was very helpful and the pizza is really good quality.  Have ordered take out a few times and always pleased with it.  The chicken sandwich was kind of plain but everything else has been amazing."}
{"text":"Nice cool atmosphere. Unique pizzas. The owner is from Chicago so it's clear he took some of the original chicago flavors and elevated it. Great thin crust. If you like sweet and spicy get the NY Honey."}
{"text":"The pizza was so gooooood!!  Literally so hot and the cheese was so good I can't get over it!   Help was so friendly too!"}
{"text":"Always, great pizza here! And the rice balls are super yum. Location is tucked off the main drag, but worth the extra steps."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Service is very good. You just have to endure the manager in the flannel shirt complaining about, well, everything. The bartenders and waitstaff are excellent."}
{"text":"Great layout. In the evenings the building cast a great shadow on the patio, which Was Awesome! I'm not to sure why they recently put the maze of metal gates on the inside of their patio.  I think it just ruined the outside space. Great pizza"}
{"text":"I have had Boss Pizza Bar bookmarked for so long and finally got a chance to pop in for a lunch meeting. The ambiance is SUPER cool. They have lots of outdoor seating (dog friendly!) and the inside has glass doors that open to create that indoor/outdoor vibe.   We split the chopped salad to start and it was absolutely delish and super filling. My biggest pet peeve are salads that aren't very hearty and this one IS! It had romaine, iceberg, grilled chicken, cabbage, ditalini pasta, bacon, tomato, green onion, blue cheese, and house made balsamic dressing. Yes, please! I could absolutely get this for my meal and be happy.   For the pizza, we split a small meat hater with no green peppers. It had mozzarella, mushrooms, spinach, and tomato with red sauce.Their pizza is New York style so very thin crust but a small was plenty for 2 of us and we even took slices home! They have really unique pizza options that all sounded pretty tasty, in fact, our pizza was supposed to be half the BLT pizza but they forgot that so we just had a full meat hater because we didn't want to wait for them to redo it but I do want to try the BLT sometime!   All in all, there are SO many pizza places in town and i'm not sure if this was my favorite pizza ever but they have so many other menu options that I would try next time. I hear their grilled cheese is pretty fab! I also read that they have a good happy hour so we'll be back to try that with our pup in tow!"}
{"text":"Good service. Great happy hour prices. Great atmosphere. Suggestion for the chef on the NY Honey Pizza, only put honey on the meat. Our food was good but the honey was overbearing and made the pizza soggy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday for lunch and noticed the happy hour specials during the week-need to come back and try them! They have a great selection of craft beers on draft and in cans. We tried the NY honey pizza and Baker as they were on special for $10. Both were fantastic- especially NY honey. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"First visit was fantastic. I had the Fat Boy double dough pizza and it was so flavorful. The multiple meat toppings worked well together. The restaurant space is HUUUGE so it would be great for parties."}
{"text":"Boss is BOSS! The atmosphere is laid back, the employees are very nice and down to earth, which is refreshing. Our bartender, James, is literally one of the nicest people I've ever met. Sit at his bar and you'll have a great conversation with a lot of laughs. Also the pizza is fireeeee!"}
{"text":"Great food,  great people,  great facility.  Very accommodating for a party we held there.  Will definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place! We came on Saturday and the food/atmosphere was awesome, we had the Memphis pizza and Margaritas, so tasty! Our bartender, Sara was so friendly and nice, you don't get that in Old Town usually! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just received my delivery order and everything is wrong except my wings. $50 worth of food and to have almost everything wrong is so disappointing! I have a cheese allergy and I wrote \"cheese on half only\" and cheese came on the entire pizza, with half being a plain cheese pizza, the other half being the NY Honey. I work in a restaurant and if there's ever any confusion, we try to get in touch with the guest right away. So, no pizza for me. Then I ordered the Cobb salad and I said blue cheese on the side (originally, the salad came with ranch and blue crumbles on it). They gave me blue cheese dressing on the side with blue crumbles still on it. So, no salad for me. The wings were the only thing I could eat and I really ordered them for my boyfriend.  Maybe I should of wrote allergy, but if you see cheese being removed from certain items, maybe YOU should have clarified.  Waste of money! Going to bed angry and hungry. One good thing I can say is that they were on the faster side, but look what that got me."}
{"text":"Boss Pizza Bar is a great new pizza joint in Old Town! The food is outstanding, restaurant is spotless and staff is wonderful. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Boss last night for dinner after reading many of the glowing reviews.  The first impression of this place is great - beautiful indoor/outdoor dining space and two spacious bars.  Our server was amazing - so friendly and helpful with the menu.  They offer a great happy hour and we tried 3 of the $5 appetizers - italian egg rolls, meatballs and rice balls...all pretty tasty!  We also tried a medium pizza - 1/2 Memphis style and 1/2 NY Spicy Honey style...so delicious!  Great location with plenty of parking, great atmosphere and tasty food too...a winning combo in my book!"}
{"text":"Ran into this place with some friends while our walking old town. Nice atmosphere with a great vive. Outside dining at its best. This place has 2 huge bars and an area you can play cornhole. The food was amazing. We ordered the New York honey and the bakers pizza and a few appetizers. All were yummy. Also our server Brittany was fantastic. She was super attentive and very sweet. Like a \"Boss!\" We will definitely be returning here. 5 stars for the great food and 5 stars for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very relaxed, staff was friendly. Went during lunch, so not a lot of people in the restaurant, but was a perfect lunch and has a great bar selection as well"}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place so badly... but, our pizza was not good... not good at all. We ordered a thin crust pepperoni pie and it was so beyond greasy it was inedible. We ended up having a single slice each and then calling it done. Pizza is our absolute favorite indulgence and we reserve Saturdays for a little slice of heaven. Unfortunately, we should have stuck to our old staples like Craft 64, Bianco's, Humble Pie it Gelato Spot for a true Wood Fired pie as this was the disappointment of the week. Giving this two stars as our Caesar salad (grilled romaine) was better than average...  the pie would have received a one star rating on it's own. With so many amazing pizza options in our backyard, I'm doubtful that Boss (or what we've coined \"Bust\") will have any longevity in Old Town. Too bad as the ambiance and concept was promising."}
{"text":"Super happy to have found this place I live up the street and had no idea Boss pizza was even there  So it's a great location to ride my bike or even walk to  Restaurant is huge and can hold large parties even has plenty of out door seating menu had a very nice selection of cocktails IPA beers and a nice wine selection. Pizza was very good extra thin crust my fav but they had many types even a deep dish type to choose from the wings were yum!!! And we ordered a small salad to be honest salad was like a packaged type lettuce with way too much dressing so it was soggy which made me a bit disappointed but all in all I was happy and will return many more time as a side note the staff was friendly and helpful in choosing our pizza"}
{"text":"Great patio, they even have a large Jenga game to keep the kids busy in the patio.  Nobody was there, they had a huge space with a lot of potential.  Much quieter than R&R down the street.  However our food order was extremely delayed.  We had a party of 20 and the kitchen couldn't handle it.  When a simple kale salad takes 45min to arrive there is something wrong with the kitchen management."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after dinner last night with my fianc√© - awesome, awesome place! The entire staff went out of their way to make our pop in for a drink an amazing experience. Jimmy, Max and the staff were incredibly friendly and we look forward to coming here on a regular basis!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful day so our minds raced for a great place for lunch on a patio in Old Town. My Buddy thought of Boss, and since it's been on my radar for some time I quickly agreed.  I might not have had I realized we would be the only customers. This place is HUGE, really big with hundreds of seats yet at lunch it was empty. They seemed to have planned for that as it appeared only 2 on staff, a cook, and a manager that served us.  We were  quickly welcomed by that manager that came out to greet us, he was friendly, likable and informative.  We sat outside at a bar and service was swift with plenty of recommendations.  Wings and Pizza it was. The 6 wings seemed like a small order and the wings were just ok, a few were broken. In my book broken wings are thrown away and not served, carrots, celery and ranch with a good buffalo sauce helped make them ok. The 14 inch Fat guy pizza was good but I didn't act on my impulse to omit Chorizo and it was regretted. The chorizo flavor almost overwhelmed  the entire pie. At $19.00 I have had so many better pizza's.   I have eaten some of the very best pizza in America, pizza is my passion and my conclusion here is that Boss has potential, great cheese and pepperoni, along with a crisp crust was enjoyable, but I also think the space could be better served as a bowling ally."}
{"text":"Very good! We tried the buffalo, Mexican, meat hater and S'mores pizza. All very good and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and such a cool layout. Great place to bring friends and family. The Memphis pizza is great. Overall fun, open environment, good service, and great pizza."}
{"text":"Great place just wish they had better portions for kids. Very small with kids portions. $6.00 for the meal and its small with no side and only soda as an option.... Way better places in town to get great value kids meal.  FYI  Don't recommend the Cesar salad. The chicken was chewy and gross"}
{"text":"Boss Pizza is a great addition to Old Town Scottsdale.  The Boss Pizza Bar offers a beautiful patio with lots of grassy area for diners to use.   The patio is fenced in making it a great place for letting the kids just run around safely.  Service was top notch.   Their private parking lot makes parking a cinch.   They offer free wifi.  Food-wise, even out little one loves the food, and she has been rather picky.   They have some fun pizza choices.  And because using a whole loaf of bread, they cut their bread length wise , their grilled cheese ends up being a meal for five."}
{"text":"Doesn't quite have the kitchen execution of Grazie or the inviting atmosphere of Oreganos, putting it in a kind of neighborhood no man's land.  They do get points for creativity.  The NY Honey is an innovative combination that works."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot in old town. I've been to boss multiple times and the pizza has been excellent each time. Additionally, I especially enjoyed the patio where my family and I were able to play games and sip on some great wines. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Its ok.  Pros:   -quiet location near Old Town (yes, that's possible) that makes outdoor dining enjoyable.  -The pizza menu is, um, different. I never thought of a Chicago pizza with sausage and girardiniera, but hey, I might try it sometime? The NY honey one just looked and sounded awful. No thanks!  - unique layout - the restaurant is in a u-shape, and wraps around the outdoor dining area on 3 sides  - pizza crust is cooked to perfection. We got ours with extra cheese and it was very good, but a shade too greasy   Cons:  - clean out the outdoor dining area already! All the trees had dropped their leaves and twigs in the dining area and it didn't look like they made an attempt to have someone clean it out.  - outdoor dining chairs were horribly uncomfortable. Time to upgrade, people! And fix the wobbly tables!  - we put our order in and said it would be 25 minutes. No big deal, that's normal. 25 minutes comes up and the waiter says he misplaced our order! What the?! It took almost an hour to get our pizza. They were kind and comp'd a beer (Lagunitas Czech Pilsner) for me, which was nice.  - bad service overall (no plates, no silverware, slow on refills, etc)   In summation, Ill give it another shot sometime. The food was decent enough to come back for, but if they fudge up again like they did last time, Ill unleash a fury of negativity on Yelp."}
{"text":"The pizza here was spot on. A whole pie loaded with cheese and extra tart marinara sauce. I'm always impressed when pie shops don't skimp on the basics of even a simple pizza.  Our server must have been new because he was being shadowed by another server, however, he should do well because he took great care of us....very attentive and super nice. Service, in my opinion, is far underrated these days. There is a full service bar, replete with Huss Koffee Kolsch."}
{"text":"What a mess!  We felt so bad for the two workers, and they were constantly apologizing that they were busy, but in reality they had no help which was not fair to me-the customer.  I worked all day and was so looking forward to relaxing and getting a hot pizza.  It came cold and so it must have just sat there.  Had to chase down the help for refills and finally canceled our salad since it took so long to get!    Then we see the owner running around looking like she was there with her kids...so unprofessional disappointing.  From Chicago?  Chicago joints are all about service first and foremost...just a mess of a place!  This could have been an awesome go to local place!  Chasing down the help to get served.  We waited 22 minutes before anyone even came to the bar!  What a joke!  Just close all ready!!!  This place and town deserve better than this!  Shameful!    Waitress says from the beginning that they were so behind that a new pizza would take long and we were hungry so we ate it.  She said that she would take care of the pizza by talking to her manager and no one ever came out from management nor did they help us out until we had to bring it up to them.  How embarrassing!    Not nice that I work all day in a restaurant myself and have to be subject to such a place that calls themselves a respectable family local place and were anything but that...I think you need to figure out how bad you want your place to work."}
{"text":"Peter Piper Pizza meets Old Town Scottsdale.  Good pizza, friendly service, awesome patio, yet it felt a little like dining at a daycare center.  This place has all the makings of the next Old Town hot spot, except it was a few clowns shy of a circus.  There were kids running all over the place while parents ignored them, huge tables of t-ball teams, kids screaming; it was a mess.  Maybe they advertised at some mom groups or elementary schools or something but it was odd.  You wouldn't expect it at most other Old Town spots so why here?  For the record, I don't hate kids.  I just don't want to hear them running around as I try to enjoy a nice meal while the parents forget their responsibilities and treat the servers as babysitters.    On the plus side, the place is massive, the patio is great, they had some really interesting pizza options and the service was solid.  Maybe the kids just showed up and took over.  Or maybe they should try to better cater to the crowd that will order more than kids meals if they want to make it in the Scottsdale dining scene.  Time will tell.  I'm rooting for you, Boss!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite spot! The weekend special is far better than any other place. Any game you want will be on, the food is great, and you're not in the mix with the crazy Sunday/funday crowd."}
{"text":"Nice place with two bars and a huge front patio.  Had a couple of beers with my buddy and the chicken wings for a snack.  No happy hour yet so it was a little pricey.  Our server and bartender Erin was a jewel."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots in old town! The best thing on the menu are their \"balls\". I've tried both their veggie balls and rice balls, and both were so tasty and really, filling enough for a meal. They come with two fried balls smothered in tomato sauce. The pizzas are pretty wonderful too. Thin crust and piled with toppings.  They have quite a bit of space, both inside and outside. I think I liked their outdoor patio more before they put up the metal fences all over...there were grassy areas and an overall very open feel. But with plenty of umbrellas, they really allow for maximum enjoyment of the outdoor space.  Great wait staff, and good beverage selection. Nothing bad to say about this place...can't wait for our next opportunity to come back here!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and even better football specials!   Two bars with plenty of TV's to see whatever game your interested in!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Went to pick up the pizza and the place was empty. Asked for extra pizza sauce, and I'm glad I did. There wasn't much on there. Was a good pizza, but expected better!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, but the food is even better! The cheese is awesome, the meatballs are out of this world good! Try 'The Honey!' too! Good place to take the kids, games to play or fun to hang with friends. The white sangria is great. Love this place! Support local and eat here!"}
{"text":"Got the meat hater pizza and loved it!   Veggies were extremely fresh!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to get a bite to eat after a Spring Training game at Scottsdale Stadium. We saw a couple of empty tables on the patio of the Boss Pizza Bar and decided to try it, especially after my daughter saw the full bar. We ordered drinks and started in on the menu. We were not in the mood for pizza so we stayed with appetizers. The nachos were wonderful. The chips were crisp, cheese stringy, and delicious avocado salsa topped it all off. The real star was Brittany. It was a real delight to have her as our waitperson."}
{"text":"Riding bikes past this spot into Old Town and decided to check it out. The HUGE patio outside caught our eye.   My daughter decided she wanted the A/C instead of enjoying a warm, pre-summer evening on the patio. Thankfully the A/C wasn't too cold. Chilly but not arctic (a plus in my book).   Service was prompt, friendly and helpful. We ordered hot wings for an appetizer and they were an equal mix of wings and drumsticks yay for us!! The hot was tingly hot and just right!   Our main dish was the 12\" thin crust Meatless Pizza with spinach, tomatoes, red onion, bell peppers, cheese and sauce. It also includes mushroom but hellllllll no, not on my pizza.   It was cut into tiny squares which was a pleasant surprise. We throughly enjoyed. Every. Last. Bite. It was more than enough for two people and was just right.   We will definitely be back. And sit outside next time. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is the lame playlist they blast inside."}
{"text":"Great service, the best thin crust pizza I have ever had, and unique choices with really good flavor! Salads were amazing too!! Try the Italian egg rolls!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last week. We ordered the NY honey pizza. It was amazing! Sweet and spicy perfection. Their chicken wings were good, much better than ones we have had around town. This will be in our top pizza places in the area. Can't wait to try more.   Update: I still love this place so much."}
{"text":"Great new place in old town Scottsdale. Huge area, enjoy the wide open space. Plenty of inside and outside dining. Great food, beverages and service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"3rd time here... Great parking, great TV's, great Caesar salad... And the well done thin crust pizza rivals Grimaldi's.  First two times here the service was lacking (we sit in bar to watch sports) But tonight Sara was our waitress, wish she worked here 24/7... Need her every time!! Only giving 4 stars due to service, but 5 star Sara brought Boss up to a solid 4... Rather than the 3 star I would have given based on previous dining experiences at Boss... Would have been 5 from the get go had the had better servers such as Sara!!!"}
{"text":"Summary: Cute place, good pizza, good service, plenty of parking. We tried a pepperoni pizza with the regular thin crust and the Meat Hater on double crust. Pizzas came out quick. We liked the pepperoni pizza more than the Meat Hater, but I preferred the double crust. Not the best pizza I've had in Old Town, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great new place in Old Town. The pizza is all super unique and tasty. They have a lot of different great drink options as well. The decor is all super cute and the service is great! I highly recommend the Memphis pizza and a Burro Mule!"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite local paces. We of course love the pizza, other favorites are the nachos and and up and coming favorite of mine is the kale Cobb salad. The ingredients are so fresh, and are much better quality than most of the offerings of Old Town Scottsdale. We like sitting inside and watching any of the games on their multiple TV's, but also like the outside patio where we can play cornhole or large scale Jenga. There are always multiple craft beers on tap, and happy hour prices are bomb! You gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Great appetizers and pizza. Try the Italian egg rolls. Looks like a good place to watch the games as they have plenty of televisions and seating."}
{"text":"We went to Boss Pizza for a quick lunch, and it did not disappoint. Honestly, I wish I knew about this place earlier. I am going to make it one of my new go-to's. Their food was awesome - we had the Chopped Salad, NY Honey, and the Memphis Pizzas. Each of them met and exceeded expectation.  Service was great as well - very attentive and were A-Ok with us having a long lunch and spending the day hanging out on their patio and playing corn hole."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Boss Pizza Bar before. The first time I ordered, I got the the NY Honey pizza. It was INCREDIBLY hot, due to the \"spicy\" soppressata they put on it. When I bit into the pizza, I couldn't really taste the flavor because the flavor was THAT over bearing. It wasn't until I took a slice of the soppressata and ate it that I realized that meat was the culprit. So, I decided to give the NY honey pizza another try because I do like spicy food---but only if it's edible. Last night, around 6pm on Saturday October 15--I ordered the NY Honey pizza, but I specifically said, \"Please substitute the soppressata for pepperoni. No soppressata on it, please.\" I was happy when I received my pizza, I bit into a slice immediately. I quickly noticed it was NOT sweet. When the honey hot sauce is on it, the pizza is distinctly sweet and sticky. Neither element was present. I took several more bits and concluded that they didn't put ANY honey hot sauce on my pizza. I did, however, notice the pizza was EXTREMELY spicy. Hummmm, extremely hot but not sweet. I took a slice and really looked at it. That's when I realized they put a gigantic amount of crushed peppers under the cheese. I could see the red flakes and the tiny white pepper seeds. I immediately called and didn't receive the help I thought I'd get. I was basically told to call back tomorrow. This is tomorrow and I called and I still didn't receive any help. It turns out there isn't a manager (I was told) and that I would need to call back in 40 minutes. Wow......okay...right. I have a photo where I picked out a huge gob of crushed peppers from just one slice. The entire pizza was like that. I couldn't eat it. I through it out. So, I'm out $19.19 (plus tax and delivery). Very disappointed, to say the least. I won't be ordering from this place again. I read some reviews about Boss Pizza Bar and I see that many have written in saying the quality and service of the food has declined. Maybe they should hire a skilled and qualified manager to run the place and maybe the food wouldn't suck so bad."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to eat. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, is very clean, and the staff is very attentive. There is a large place to enjoy one's dinner outside and that is very appealing.  I had the \"Double Dough\" Chicago Style and it was very good. It wasn't as thick as Deep Dish Pizzas but it was thicker than traditional Italian Pizza. There was a ton of meat on the topping and the whole meal was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza, generous portions as well. I am slightly bias, as it is in my neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"New place in old town that's a must to try out!!!  Large open area with picnic tables and welcoming environment. First impression was slow but expected with it being open only a week. We walked in the back gate and was looking around. Greeted by Caleb quickly to offer assistance because we must of looked lost due to the large area and multiple bar areas.  I'm a big customer service person and its a make or break from the beginning and Caleb did a great job welcoming us to a new local place.   Good bar area where Erin and Matt both did a great job taking care of us and made us feel welcomed. Local brew from AZ on tap and some Chicago based brews as well! Once again great service from the two of them all while taking care of the others who were coming in.  The place as a whole is pretty big for being in Scottsdale but has a warm and small feel but open to the elements which is a great thing.   The important part is the food. Pizza..... TOP NOTCH!!! Great job on the pizza! Had the Fat Guy pizza and it was awesome! Will come back for it hands down. The sausage had a nice spice and great toppings. Price wasn't too bad for a loaded pizza in my opinion.   One of the biggest things I like about this place was that the staff seemed to get along and want the same thing, Great service for all. They were willing to help each other out and do it joyfully. That was a big plus in my book. Even the small things like servers helping the bar staff refill the ice when it was getting low or servers rushing to a closed door to open it when the server had full hands walking in from his table! Team Service is Great Service!! Keep it up.   I would like to see more taps with more draft beer but understand the limited options being a new area but some other options would be great! Esp with so many local draft options in the valley! Wouldn't mind a few more IPA's on draft personally.   Will be back for sure and telling others because the pizza is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pizza, too thin and \"wet\" crust, per my friend who had to eat it with a fork because it flopped too much. Wings and beer were really good, they have this super hot sauce, can't remember the name, but I HAD to try a sample and it was super good hot. We also had a salad that was super good and fresh. Busy, trendy and in a good place. Will be back! Service at the bar was very good."}
{"text":"Great new pizza place, with two bars and a large outdoor seating area. They also have several TVs in the bar area. My husband had the fried chicken sandwich and I had the BLT on Steroids pizza. Both were solid. They have only been open a week, so it wasn't that busy, but I definitely see it being a great place that we add to our rotation."}
{"text":"Went here with my family and really enjoyed our experience. Nice space with good, efficient but not obtrusive service, and tasty thinner-crust pizza with high quality ingredients and a few non-traditional and creative combinations. It was all relatively reasonably priced, too, as we had some wine, beer and appetizers and it still came out to about $20 a person. Very inviting space, kind of like a \"compound\" with a couple of buildings, two bars, and a huge outdoor space that will be perfect once the summer heat is over. I highly recommend it. Only complaint--as a couple others have voiced--is that the outside gets to be a playground when there are too many kids there. Maybe the outside kind of invites that, though...it's a wide open space with grass and plenty of room to play. I bet it's better later in the evening (e.g. after 7 or 8) once the kids are gone. Still, I'm not taking any stars off for that--it might've been just one night with some inattentive parents or something. Not the restaurant's fault! Go here and enjoy some fresh, creative pizza at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The server (Alexandra) was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and made great recommendations. We shared the cobb salad and fried chicken sandwich. The salad was super fresh and cold (hate room temp salads) - delicious dressing.  The fried chicken sandwich was AMAZING.   Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Mikey the GM took good care of us after our pizza came out slightly wrong. There was a very busy crowd on friday night and i think Boss Pizza will eventually need to hire more servers to keep up with the demand of customers in order to make sure customers are being taken care of in a timely manner  :) food was delish!"}
{"text":"Nice people cheap drinks but the food was not very good at all .  I didn't get a pizza but from what I saw I wasn't missing anything.  They have tried to be trendy with the deconstruction mode that was over 3 years ago and frankly I don't miss. Hope the trip food wise gets better."}
{"text":"Amazing place, service was 5 star,  food was awesome. Definitely will be a regular. Great location, love the decor. Only 1 suggestion, hopefully will have misters for the summer. Love the appetizers menu as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service!  Split a salad with my partner, he had a drink, I drank water. 16\" two item pizza. $47.00.  Seems a bit steep but was still pleased. My only complaint was they use the cheapest silverware ever. Seriously....really cheap."}
{"text":"We ordered almost half their pizzas on the menu (we came in with a pretty big group) loved the pizzas - watch out for the Mexican pizza it's spicy!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this place will not make it. Walked in on Saturday night and took FOREVER to get drinks not alone pizza. Bartender was rude and didn't know what she was doing. Such a great ambience but the service completely sucks. We had 8 people and 1 of 3 pizzas didn't get served. BUMMER cause the place looks awesome and actually had a great product."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza, salty wings, and less than average service. No wonder it's 8:15 on a Saturday night in Old Town Scottsdale and no one's in the place. Don't Bother ..."}
{"text":"Great pizza and staff! Highly recommend giving it a try! We had a large group and our bartender Sarah was amazing!"}
{"text":"We love this place! They have a fabulous patio area, great drink selection, and their NY honey pizza is the BOSS! Not to mention, you can't come here without trying the grilled wings and Italian egg rolls! It's such a great place to hang out with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great beer and even better patio..and to top it off, nice and genuine people from Chicago own it!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience we ordered drinks, nachos and a pepperoni pizza.  It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and VERY cold nachos that were horrible, highly doubt they make their own cheese sauce pretty sure its store bought Cheese Whiz.  The pizza took an hour to get (sub par) and the customer service didn't exist."}
{"text":"Tony and his staff really care about Customer Experience ! Last night I went in for pizza and drinks, and was blown away by how awesome the Boss Pizza Team was!!! I ordered the NY Honey (currently my mouth is watering thinking about it). I also ordered a Two Brothers Wobble which is a local brewery that for some odd reason is never found in other local establishments- BEST LOCAL BEER AROUND! So excited I know a place that carries it!   For dinner it was myself, my boyfriend, and  our roommate. Myself and my roomie requested The Bachelor finale, and my boyfriend requested the Coyotes Hockey Game for the TV display. They made it happen so everyone could watch TV while dining! It was amazing they were willing to honor our request. This place is FAR from PRETENTIOUS and I can not thank them enough for putting the customer experience first !   THANK YOU BOSS PIZZA!!!"}
{"text":"Great new pizza bar in Scottsdale. They are gearing up to accommodate the sports lovers and have large screen TV's everywhere! They also have a huge outdoor area, with plenty of room for everyone.   The bartender, Jimmie, was friendly and attentive. The pizza was good, but I wished it was a bit crustier.  The beer selection was excellent, with lot's of variety."}
{"text":"The patio is super cute and chill. Picnic tables with grass and tables with tolix-style red chairs. I heard a server saying they will put up misters and lights soon. It is definitely kid-friendly, nice for the whole family. The staff was all very friendly.   Interesting pizzas with lots of different meats. A nice drink menu with cocktails, craft beers, and wines. My husband's beer was only $2, though my mule was $9.   The inside was not as pretty and relaxing as the outside. The inside was bare and had giant tvs like a sports bar. Would be good if you wanted to watch a game.  Overall, a great new place in Old Town. Makes amazing use of the outdoor space."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved the thin crust pizza. It was almost cracker like, and with all the toppings, it wasn't soggy. We had the meat haters with pepperoni.  I added a side house salad that came with a delicious vinaigrette.  I was in the mood for dessert so we ordered the pizza cookie with vanilla bean Gelato.  It was okay- the cookie was a bit too gooey to the point of almost being raw and overall, it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But everything was great.  I loved the outside dining area under lit trees- very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful and very fast. Loved the atmosphere. Food was very good. Loved the Caesar salad it was grilled lettuce"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious! Staff was too much. I understand it was a slower time but there was a lot of checking in way too often which can be confusing but the food and drinks were great. Great hue venue off the Main Street which can be nice for groups!"}
{"text":"BRITTANY was our attentive friendly server. She was the best! I ordered my new favorite drink, the  White Wine Sangria! My husband had his fave beer, Kiltlifter. I have to admit,  it is an awesome beer.  OK, now this place is clean, trendy, family friendly, delicious and affordable. The pizza is crazy good. Artisan pizza at its best. There is plenty of parking too! We will definately be back."}
{"text":"The bartender was great but what the heck is up with the kitchen. The pizza has been awesome but after coming in to watch Sunday football and have one of their football Sunday special burgers we were disappointed to see the party across the bar have awesome looking burgers with buns to only 2 minutes later be served burgers with dry un-toasted cut up pieces of white bread.  We sent it back for buns only to find out they ran out of buns and they had no plans to remedy the situation. So we left to drink and have a burger a few blocks away.   Come on! Own up to the issue, come out and tell us you ran out of buns before we were served, let us know the issue, offer options...go to a nearby grocery store for buns and ask us if we'd be willing to wait a few minutes.  So sad because I love the scene and location."}
{"text":"Was on vacation from Austin, Texas during spring break. My family and I love to try different pizza places while on vacation. This has to be one of the best ! The flat bread pizza was amazing. The combos of sauce and toppings was just perfect. Definitely will be back when back in the area."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome pizza! We only went there because my sister can't eat gluten, but they had options, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This pizza and chopped salad were amazing! We had the meat haters pizza on thin crust. Everything about it is perfection! We loved the chopped salad. It is huge. Boss is a must have for me!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! The Memphis was my favorite but we tried the Baker, the Fat Guy, the BLT and the Mexican. Mexican didn't have much flavor it seemed like. Baker was surprisingly pretty good!"}
{"text":"More of a 3 1/2 stars but rounded up for good service. Been being to try this place. Pizza place with solid reviews always gets my attention.   We came here with our pup and ate on the patio. ++ on being dog friendly. Ordered a medium double dough pizza. I was thinking this would be damn near pan or thick crust but it was thin pizza to my standards.   Pizza was so-so. Kind of tasted like \"kiddy pizza\". Pre-made dough, sauce was basic.   I would come back and try something else on the menu. Place is pretty cool though!"}
{"text":"They had me at Italian egg roll!! It was so good!! Great thin crust pizza, we ordered half bacon cheeseburger and half BLT of steroids and holy crap we devoted it!! Great service, yummy fresh food and cold beers. It's a big place too, good for large parties and kids and they have a great happy hour!!! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"New Hot Spot on the Block...This place had the best mouth watering ,finger lick'in good pizza i've had in a long time...The service is off the hook and staff is friendly treats you like family...I will be back with all my friends...And the word is they may be having Live Entertainment coming...Now that would be fantastic...Check this place out ...Cheer's Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went with a group so we split 5 pizzas - the Baker, Mexican, Memphis, Fat Guy and the BLT. The Baker & Memphis were my favorite, but the Fat Guy had great flavor too & others loved the BLT. The Mexican was our least favorite, there wasn't enough flavor. We tried the nachos, meatballs & salsas for appetizers and all were yummy. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I came here on my own and sat at the left side of bar on a Friday night, since the right bar was closing. I ordered a beer from the male bartender who looked a little upset about something.  After drinking about half of the Sierra Nevada beer the bartender poured me (that was on draft), I noticed a what looked to be like something floating in the beer, kid you not. I promptly walked out of there.  Not sure I'll be back even though someone floated that the pizza is okay."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. First time I went, we sat at the bar and the bartender messed up our order and didn't correct it. The second time, I tried a new pizza and they got it right and it was delicious. Great flavor and good beer too. Also recommend you check in for 10% off."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant in old town. It's slightly off the beaten path so it's taking a while to get busy. Go enjoy it before the word gets out. REALLY comfortable feel and COLD BEER!!"}
{"text":"Takeout, this was our 2nd time coming to Boss and the food was just as good as the first time. The reason I bring up the takeout aspect is not a lot of places do it correctly. They were perfect! We phoned in the order, they told us when it would be ready, we showed up at that time and everything was ready to go. We were in and out in less than 5 minutes including parking as they have ample spots. The order was exactly what we placed and they included all the sides that you usually have to ask for.  We had ordered the wings this time around which were awesome. Went with the mild so the whole family could enjoy and they were perfect some of the best wings around. Not to mention they weren't drenched in sauce in the takeout container. I can highly recommend either eating at the restaurant or taking it to go regardless you will get a great meal! Long live the Boss!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible, the bar maid shooed us away because she was too busy with her bar customer's, are you fricken kidding me.  The 4 of us went out side to site and a waiter never dame to us, one hour later we left, I will never go back there again."}
