{"text":"I agree....  The new Zeus Greek restaurant is terrible!   No flavour for anything.   Salad had a lot of veggies but the dressing had no flavour.  Chicken souvlaki was grilled fresh but there was no marinade or salt - no flavour.   Rice and potatoes... Usually super yummy at other Greek places... No flavour here.  Even the tzaziki didn't taste like garlic.  Would not recommend this place.  Worst \"Greek\" food I've ever had, if you can even label it that.  I don't think this place will last.  (Limited menu, fast food type of joint but not fast in service)."}
{"text":"Well, they didn't ever make their official grand opening. They closed up around November 20 and papered over the windows.  As of December 3 they have a new banner over the sign for \"Zeus Greek Grill Gods\" and the inside has been repainted in a blue and white scheme ala the Greek flag.  We will see what happens to the new place.  No idea if this is new people or the same guy but revamping to greek only.  Couldn't go in as they weren't open  but the menu was on a white board Icould see thru the window and they only seemed to have souvlaki, salads and  a few starters so far."}
{"text":"I ordered  two lamb souvlaki dinners and I received lamb niblets, overcooked hash brown potatoes and my little scoop of rice wasn't very good.  Never again /10"}
