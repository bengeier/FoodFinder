{"text":"I ordered Chinese food here an hour and twenty minutes ago and I'm still waiting for my food! I called they didn't say sorry about that or anything.... I wonder if the food will ever get here:/ Well they just called back and said it will be here in 30 min. 2 hours for delivery ??  This place is a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you have a craving for chinese food...go somewhere else.  This is the worst food we have ever had.   They have the nerve to even charge higher prices than other places.  Our order ended up in the garbage!"}
{"text":"the absolute worst canadianized chinese food i've had. ever. the ginger beef was rubbery, bland and mushy, and the pork fried rice was bland, bland, bland. we spent a total of $40 for dinner for two. it would have been money better spent at mandarin buffet. blech."}
{"text":"Tried some takeout, the place is nearby. Terrible Chinese food. I've had worst back in Montreal, but that place was a discount \"Chinese takeout\" place located in a bad neighborhood. It was also run by French Canadians, I let it pass. This place is run by what appears to be Asians, in downtown area, yet the food is almost as bad as that dingy place in montreal.   Rice is too salty. Beef is rubbery. Everything is just bad. Not cheap either. I know places that serve chinese food 100 times better AND cheaper. Back in Montreal tho, I'm new here.   Guess I will still be looking for a good Chinese resto. *Le sigh*"}
{"text":"Was staying at a nearby hotel for a week and decided to grab some takeaway.  This place was nearby and seemed clean, white and bright in a somewhat well-worn part of town.  The menu is vast, full of vibrant photos of dishes brimming with ingredients.  So I ordered the spicy pork noodles, described as lean pork tossed with noodles, veggies, and a special hot sauce ($9.24).    When I got back to the hotel and sat down to chow down, I was disappointed to open up a somewhat small container of extremely thin noodles, tossed with very finely ground pork \"granules,\"  some occasional traces of thin sliced green onions and a few bits of white button mushrooms (boo - no shitake?).  Whomever designed this dish is decidedly a fan of minimalism.  Well almost... hiding under and within my small toupee of hair-like noodles was a dozen or so chunks of semi-steamed tomatoes.  Very blah in effort and not the least bit spicy.    Overall, it felt like a dish designed to imply volume but that skimps on everything but the cheapest ingredients.  To top it off, they neglected to provide and napkins or utensils, so I had to eat with a plastic teaspoon that happened to be in the room.  If near, skip it.    Ho-Lee-Bow-Wow."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has gone downhill.  I ordered here one night and the food was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  It's pretty hard to screw up fried rice and beef with broccoli, but this place managed to do so.  The spring rolls had the tiniest piece of shrimp in them, and were mostly filled with cabbage, not to mention they were disgustingly greasy.  The pork fried rice had a few tiny pieces of pork.  It was ridiculous.  The beef and broccoli was basically just a container of broccoli -- there were a few skinny pieces of beef in there.  The general tso chicken with broccoli was probably the best dish, which isn't saying much.  It was at least tasty and the chicken portion was adequate.  And what the hell happened to their fortunate cookies? How do you screw up on fortune cookies?? These things tasted like cardboard.  What a disappointing meal.  We'll be sure to order from another Chinese place next time."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food -- not just Chinese food, but food in general -- I have ever had delivered in my entire life! Not to mention, incredibly expensive for small portion sizes! That said, I'm glad the portions were small because it was less for me to throw out in the garbage.   The overall flavor is just, sour and tangy. Almost as if it's completely spoiled.   Hot garlic wings: 4/10 Vegetables with tofu: 3/10 Cantonese chow mein: 0/10 Garlic beef: 1/10 Vegetable fried rice: 6/10 Overall: 2/10 = 1 star rating"}
{"text":"Toronto's largest chain of Chinese food restaurants, this business has made it's mark from the number of take out menus they have sent to everyone's mailbox thanks to the assistance of the good ol' mail carriers at Canada Post.   Food here is average, not bad.  I ordered Lo Mein and Singapore Noodles, and found that Lo Mein was flavorless but the Singapore Noodles were okay, yet not too spicy just the way I like it.   Prices are a bit high for a take out place, and I prefer to order from Spring Rolls (better food for better price) or a local Chinese restaurant than from this place again. Delivery time is about 45 minutes to an hour, and they take credit cards which is good if you don't have any cash on hand.  Would I order from them again? The answer is yes, but only if there were no other options available at the time I placed my delivery. Otherwise, I would skip this joint and look elsewhere to please my cravings for good Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"In a moment of desperation, we ordered delivery from Ho-lee Chow. Our expectations were low, and sadly, the experience was even worse than expected. Noodles, rice, chicken, beef - it pretty much all tasted the same, which was kind of creepy. Don't waste your time - even the dogs were skeptical about eating it."}
{"text":"I am starting a campaign to replace the interjection \"Holy Cow\" with \"Ho Lee Chow\" -- but only for crappy things. Example: \"Ho Lee Chow! Check out the muffin top on that chick!\" or, \"Ho Lee Chow! I can't believe he left you at the altar!\" or, perhaps, \"Ho Lee Chow! The food at Ho Lee Chow is terrible!\"   ...because it *is*, folks. It's bad. It's probably the worst of the egregiously worst American-based Chinese (ABC) food I've ever had. Worse than P.F. Changs, worse than Chin Chin, worse than Panda Express. We're talking:   - General Tso's Chicken that was all breading and barely chicken - Beef and Broccoli that uses extremely fatty and over-marinated cuts of beef - Wonton Soup with a strangely sweet taste, like meat that's gone bad (also: delivered in EVIL STYROFOAM CONTAINERS) - Veggie Fried Rice made with rice that wasn't cooked all the way through, so the grains weren't even tender  The only thing in my delivery order that was even partially decent were the mixed vegetables with shrimp, and there wasn't anything special about it. Also, no MSG, which is nice. Their online ordering system for delivery works fine as well, which is more than I can say for Spring Rolls (my usual go-to for food delivery).  This meal was sorely disappointing not only because the food was so terrible, but also because I've had the flu this week and really needed some trashy-yet-satisfying ABC food to soothe my sniffly soul. The food at HLC is just trashy."}
{"text":"The food is OK but just OK.  The price is outrageous for what you get.  They have put a lot of effort in giving you as little as possible with each order. Ordered last night and this would be my second order and I will say the last.  I ordered three dishes.  Nothing fancy.  Ordered for a couple of us.  We were all shocked at how small the portions were.  A friend said \"I guess you are paying for the label\".  Pretty funny I thought but stopped laughing when I paid 50 bucks for just 3 dishes.  Won't do it again...ever.  The place is a rip off."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Grand Hotel just down the street from Ho-Lee-Chow last weekend.  Hungry, and not feeling like wandering around the city looking for food, we just walked in and placed an order.  There's a big sign in the window to let you know that they don't use MSG in the food.  That's a good thing.  I think this is mainly a delivery place, there is nowhere to sit and eat inside, but who cares, we were taking food back to the hotel to eat anyway.  Our food came really fast after we ordered it, which is also great.  It's in no way the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it was fresh and delicious and not very expensive.  We had vegetables in black bean sauce and vegetable fried rice with no egg.  Sometimes places give me flack about the no egg thing, but they didn't mind doing it, so that gives a few extra brownie points.  If I lived in Toronto, I'd probably order delivery from here on those nights when I don't feel like cooking.  It's not going to blow your mind or anything, but it's what they say on their sign, fast, fresh and no msg."}
{"text":"Studying for exams for a course I probably shouldn't have taken sucked the life out of me.  No energy to cook, and I really had a craving for stir-fried mixed vegetables.    Unfortunately, a lot of restaurant websites sucked, and Ho-Lee-Chow offered clear choices and a convenient ordering system.  The prices were a bit high, but I didn't have to worry about having cash on hand and everything was spelled out on the receipt.  Delivery instructions can be specified and it all came a lot faster than I expected.  Plus, the 2-for-1 soup special meant that I could try the wonton soup as well as the hot and sour.  The wonton soup is bland and not that great.  Don't do it!  Or have a lot of condiments handy.  The hot and sour soup is sour, but needs a large boost in the hotness.  The spring rolls are bland too, but had a good crispness.  So it's basically comfort food that I'd be embarrassed to admit eating, but it hit the spot.  (Since I have a selection of condiments at home.)  I wish my fortune cookie said something more exciting than, \"Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.\"  That doesn't always work between the sheets!"}
{"text":"This review is focused on customer service.    I live out in Etobicoke by Humber Bay.  Ho-Lee-Chow is now offering delivery in my area and I placed an order online.  I accidentally left out a digit in  my address on lake shore, so the order went to the downtown location.  The delivery driver called as he couldn't find my place, and we discovered the error.  He still drove my order all the way out from downtown Toronto to complete the sale.  Very impressed, you just don't get that kind of service.  The driver spent some time making sure I knew it was my error, which it was, but I didn't mind.  He spent probably an hour in total what with driving to the wrong place and then out to Etobicoke and back to Toronto.  And yes, I tipped big, it was only fair;)"}
{"text":"The WORST food I've had in about 10 years ! !  - maybe longer.  They now deserve a rating of Zero.  This restaurant has gone SO far downhill it's like they've dropped off a cliff.  The food is INEDIBLE !  You might remember Ho Lee Chow from before they went bankrupt or closed down for some reason.  Well they are back - and the food is NOTHING like it used to be.  Before they closed the food had a certain junk food quality that was fairly often satisfying - it sometimes hit the spot.  Not anymore.  I will NEVER, never order from this place again.  First of all, they sent me one of the wrong things - next to what I ordered on the menu - but not what I ordered.  And NONE of the food was anything like it used to be.  The Ja Do wings were Terrible - I couldn't eat more than 3 bites.  Terribly bland and tasteless and nothing like before.  They were so bad I really got the sense if I ate any more I might risk food poisoning.  The breaded shrimp was the worst I think I've ever had.  Nothing like before and SO bad.  And the Shrimp with salt and pepper was MUSH.  Total mush.  If you are thinking about ordering from this pathetic excuse for a restaurant - please don't make the mistake I did.  I ordered from this chain about 20 times over the years - NEVER AGAIN !"}
{"text":"This place is o.k.  Just not A-ok.  We've ordered from here a few times.  Chinese food, Canadianized/Westernized.  Prices are typical for take out here in TO.  I liked their mixed veggie dish, but would thumbs down the same dish/any of their dishes as leftovers.  Just my opinion.  They have a fair selection, and if you expect just standard fare, you'll be fine.  Ho-Lee Chow's has a Fast Food quality, certainly not a Chinese Authentic Cuisine feel to it.  other: some places charge for delivery, but do not share the delivery charge with the driver.  I think HLC's like that, and if you want to tip the driver, you'll have to add a tip on top of the del charge."}
