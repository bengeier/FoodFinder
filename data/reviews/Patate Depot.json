{"text":"This is just by my house and I go often. Service is fast and the people there are very friendly. They have places to sit and eat inside and outside as well. They have very good family deals and those were very helpful while I was moving this summer. Fries are very good and also fresh. They also have very good poutine. Since I tried this place I no longer go to La Belle Province. Good prices and great food, I will for sure keep coming back"}
{"text":"The fare is as expected, nothing stands out. They use real cheese curd in their poutine. The gravy is sweeter and that mellows out the excessive salt content. The young lady at the cash deserves half of the stars. She was attentive and genuinely caring."}
{"text":"Patate Depot reminded me of a family owned Belle Province with a specialty in potatoes. I ordered their #1 Combo that consisted of a couple of steamies, a poutine and fountain soda.  The steamies are the regular Lafleur fare and all in all, good. I was neutral about my poutine, sure it was huge but the sauce didn't appeal to me too much. The curds were real but the gravy was off. Eating the fries however were pretty much excellent. Nothing to complain about salty, greasy fries!  Price-tag is about what you'd expect, $10 and the service was quick and efficient. Solid place. If I'd come back, I'd like to try their Cheese-steak, the gentleman before me got it and I liked what I saw."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! There are I think 15 different  poutine choices. It's a very clean place to sit and eat. My food was satisfying! I suggest this place to anyone whose picky or loves to eat. Foodies!"}
