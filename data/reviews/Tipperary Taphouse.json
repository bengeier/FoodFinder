{"text":"Dinner here on a Thursday night, a small crowd at the bar, relaxed, chatting with one another and the bartender. I chose to sit at the last booth to be away from the chatter. Each booth has a little tv screen on the wall set to CP24. Good entertainment :) The light at the booth was comfortable, I think it's brighter now in the restaurant?   I had the pie of the day which is a steak and mushroom pie with Guinness gravy ($12). Salad or fries come with it. It was a good pie, pastry was flaky and tasty. Filling was rich. Kids' meal was a good value at $7.50 that comes with a drink and ice-cream. The Shepherd's Pie was a good size! The pie was tasty too, I'll order that for myself next time. A friend had the French Onion soup. Maybe the regular cook was away but the soup came with a thin slice of cheese on top, half melted away, instead of the generous, puffy cheese with a nice brown crust on it that I had on my first visit here.   3.5 stars for the meal and service. 4 stars if the presentation had been better ;)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Nine TVs for sports viewing.  Music isn't too loud.  Menu is changed regularly.  We ordered the special onion scoops but they were out so we had the Irish meatballs instead. The gravy was delicious, the polenta was skilfully made and perfectly cooked.   For our entr√©es we had the fettuccine with coleslaw, the holy guacamole burger and the chilli pot pie.  Fries were stellar: medium thickness, golden brown and crispy and served with malt vinegar on the table. We got a side of gravy because the first round was so good. It's too bad we were too full for dessert!  Beers on tap include Rickard's Red, Red Falcon, Mill Street,  Guinness and a Beau's Revolving Tap as well as classics like Coors and Canadian among others.  It has only been around for 6 months but it's a great neighbourhood establishment."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing, friendly place to be.  If I am going to cheap on my gluten free diet, I break all rules for their French fries.  The best around, just like the old fashion chip truck quality!  My fav and best secret around the riblets.  Good burgers, sandwiches etc.  Owner very accommodating, if you're a  regular she'll try to accommodate your likes for you."}
{"text":"I honestly feel bad leaving a poor review because the server was ultra friendly.  But it got more friendly of course after a few screw ups.   1. Huge curly hair in Irish Nachos - like picked up 5-6 nachos stuck in cheese - so gross but they voided it.    2.  Delivered the wrong burger from what was ordered.  Ordered bacon/cheese special burger got a basic, dry, frozen patty generic \"classic burger\".  3.  That dark brown gravy shown in all the photos is disgusting.  Tastes fresh out of the powder container.   Sorry guys you need to step it up bigtime."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times, and have really enjoyed the food. Great menu. The beef ribs, pulled pork sandwich, wings, all great. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Food seems frozen, not fresh. Servers seem to be poorly treated as well. Won't be returning."}
