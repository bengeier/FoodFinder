{"text":"Don't go out of your way to get there because they probably won't be open. They were closed early the last two times I went there."}
{"text":"La Bamba lives on better in my memory.  I was at U of I when they first opened up on Green Street.  They seemed much tastier back then.  Now they seen so very bland, and they DEFINITELY are not bigger than your head, a definite change from back then.  I tried it tonight, the first time in years, and I can say that I would not recommend it.  Sorry La Bamba."}
{"text":"I love La Bamba.  Great food, authentic, quick and cheap.  I personally love the steak tacos with cilantro and onions (traditional tacos) and the steak burrito.  My BF always gets the fajita meal with is enough food to feed 2-3 people (or have lots of leftovers.)  The only thing there I'm not a huge fan of is the ground beef, so I just dont get it.  Everything else is amazing! and there open late.  No more Taco Bell for me."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than one star I would. Took over an hour for my food to arrive and when it did everything was cold. Took a bite of my burrito and it was cold and slimy. Gave the burrito to my roommate. He offered to pay me, told him it's not worth anything...hopefully the quesadilla is better but I doubt it...feeling hungry for REAL Authentic Mexican!"}
{"text":"\"what would you like for dinner lady?\"my hubby asked me and I said \"I would like chicken tacos from La Bamba\" and he said \"ooook\",  as you can tell he is not a big fan of this place but we have some tacos from this place from time to time. 

I admit it is a very simple place and the food it is not the best one; however the way I asked for my tacos to be done it convert them to a better and tastier version that I happen to like a lot. Ok, I will reveal my secret to you just because I think it is not fair to keep it all to myself:

1) I asked the guys to toast the tortillas longer (they get a little bit crunchy)
2) I asked them to put cheese in between the two tortillas (you have to ask for it at the same time they put the tortillas on the griddle).
3) I am a chicken lover so they add shreded chicken to my tacos (I think chicken it is the best option here).
4) for toppings, I only ask for lettuce, cilantro and avocado.

Last but not least, ask for hot sauce and some lime wedges on the side. Once I get home I put a little bit of salt to my tacos, some hot sauce and lime juice and for me, it is like a mariachi singing in my ear. I recommend the tacos that way, so buen provecho! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The only thing that bamba's has is that it is open late enough that if you are drunk, you may eat it.  Just NEVER during the day. I got massive food poisoning from here. 

The only reason it gets two stars is because it really is a part of campus nostalgia. Everyone knows bambas."}
{"text":"I WANT La Bamba to be as good as it USED to be.  It breaks my heart that something that USED to be INCREDIBLE, has become so very average.  
Way back in the day, I used to have to bring guys La Bamba when I went to drill for the National Guard.  Mind you, the drive was 2.5 hours away, and guys didn't care.  They ate it cold.
My first experience was at the one on Campus probably over 20 years ago.  The line was outside thd door and down the street after the bar closed.  I got my 1st Super Combo, and I was like WTF did I just get myself into.  It really WAS \"as big as your head\" back then.  I had no idea how to attack it, and my buddy pointed to the mural on the wall, and said \"do it like he is\".  The guy on the mural was using two hands, being gentle with it, like holding a baby.

Fast forward to now.  They use about half the meat they used to.  You really don't need the second hand to hold the burrito.  The prices have gone  up.  It's really disheartening.
I tried it again today, because I haven't had it in about a year.  There were times I used to get it at least once a week after the bars, and once a week while I was sober.  
Today's order was the Taco Salad Value Meal.  I had it delivered through OrderUp.  When it got here, it wasn't a taco salad.  It was their nachos MINUS the yummy cheese sauce.   I like nachos.  I used to LOVE their Super Nachos.  But that's not what I wanted today.  I wanted a taco salad.  If Im going to be sent basically Super Nachos instead, at least put the yummy cheese sauce on it.  

I hope someone at La Bamba reads this.  And I hope they know I USED to be a SUPER fan of their food.  I want the old La Bamba back.  I want business to boom and I want them to stay in business.  I don't want to see them have to close because they cant afford to keep the doors open.  But with the quality of food Ive gotten there the past few times Ive been there, Im afraid things are going the wrong way.  There are taco trucks doing it better than La Bamba's brick and mortar stores.  
Like I said, its really disheartening.  They have the POTENTIAL to be VERY good for the menu that they have."}
{"text":"Aweful!
Ate there twice now and it is way overpriced and not good at all. We got a burrito, a cheese quesadilla and a tiny thing of cheap chips with this weird cheese sauce and it was 20 dollars! Bad food, definitely never going back there again!"}
{"text":"If I were on death row.... This would be my last meal.  Undoubtedly, the best burritos ever."}
{"text":"I have to say that I love the super nachos they have here they are covered in juicy meat and beautiful cheese with all the toppings. 

But when it comes to tacos they are dry and not exactly exploding in flavor like the nachos. 

I've heard that when you go you should always have one of the right cooks making you're tacos I wasn't told which one but I'm assuming I didn't get the right one because they weren't good at all. 

If it wasn't for the nachos and the fact the people were very nice while making the food  I wouldn't be giving them 3 stars. (
Side note, I don't know the name of the guy but if you want good tacos the guy with the mustache is the best cook there, at least that's what I'm assuming because there is only ever 2 people there he was one of them)"}
{"text":"One of my fave go-to places after a night out on Green St.  Sometimes waiting in line was even more fun than going out - made friends in line, saw people throwing up, passing out, getting in fights.  Never go in the daytime though, the only respectable time to go is when the bars close and you're craving Mexican food.

Two words - SUPER NACHOS.  Steak is the best.  They put a bunch of toppings on there, it's well worth the money to get the super nachos.  YUM.  The best part is the CHEESE - it's this delicious white melty cheese they plop on top.  If it weren't for the cheese, we would never go to La Bamba's."}
{"text":"1st stop every time I come back to Madison. I started with them back at U of Illinois in the 80's and the still deliver a great filling burrito as big as your head. Good stuff, wish I had one in Chapel Hill."}
{"text":"We wanted to try burritos as \"big as your head\" however, the food there was something that tastes like it came off the bottom of your foot.  This is the WORST excuse for a Mexican restaurant I've ever tasted.   I asked if they had Carne Asada burritos and they said this is \"close\" .... NOT!!  Not sure if it was even fresh meat.  We both threw ours away and I'm not positive that we won't throw it up later at some point.  Not one thing to say positive.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and WILL NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"Some of the unhealthiest food you'll eat, but man is it good!  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The prices are pretty fair considering how filling the food is.

The best part about the place it that it defies what you think a burrito stand will be.  It is, without a doubt, the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen.  It has an open kitchen so you can see how everything sparkles.  The floors are spotless and,after a long night of drinking, I'd be totally cool with eating off of them."}
{"text":"As the (seemingly) only restaurant open on the East Side after 9-10p; LaBamba's has become something of a staple for me, which is cool, since they have good cheap ($.99 beef tacos on Tue/Sat), fresh  authentic (for Madison, WI...) food made how I like it. The Staff are very friendly, they now know me by face since I've been stopping there so often. There's no drive thru, but the service is good enough that I've never been in/out in more than 5min. They have a pretty large menu, all of it made to order for you. As of this posting I've not been able to confirm the burrito/head claim as per the motto, will update if I'm able. 
The cons: The size of the tacos is relatively small (think street-food snack-handheld... or just buy one, you'll see), so get like 3. The access to this location is via the EW service road, which though 'paved' is one of the worst roads easily I've seen, even by madtown standards. So expect 30s of bumpy ride & testing your car's suspension sys. Its not the place's fault, in fact their lot is nice and well-maintaned; just thought id give a heads up. 
My personal recommendations are the tacos al pastor w/ cilantro, onions, and a cup of their horchatta, which isn't over-rich like I've had at some places. Also they stay open late (THANK YOU, at least one place gets it, lets start a movement here people!), nice variety of Jarritos bottles if you want something other than the fountain, They'll include hot sauce & limes if you want & the staff are great at helping if you're trying to learn some Spanish. Look for coupons sometimes in the monthly savings mailers. But if your by east towne and quiznos or KFC is closed and need something quick, cheap, and yum, stop by LaBambas."}
{"text":"I don't typically eat here during the day, but late nights?  Hells yeah!

Because it's so so close to Green St., it's generally fairly busy come 2am on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights, but the line to order food somehow is never long (finding somewhere to sit can be a little tricky at times).  They advertise as having \"burritos the size of your head\" and have some better than decent Americanized Mexican food.

It is a little bit more expensive than I'd ideally like to pay (well, ideally I'd like to pay nothing...), but all in all a great place to get some late night drunk food.  I personally always go for their super nachos (my mouth's watering just thinking about them) and their staff has always been very nice, quick with my order, and funny - they love teasing me for the fact I know no Spanish (took 4 years of Latin in high school instead) by telling me I owe them treinta (30) when it only comes out to $6.01!  Haha, but they're just messing around, so don't worry, they're not trying to take advantage of poor drunk college kids.

Oh, and $.99 tacos on Tuesdays for lunch!  Niiice."}
{"text":"Ok, so lets just get something straight here. This isn't a place for a spectacular gourmet meal or anything. Conversely, BURRITOS THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD?! Come on, it is just down right monstrous. Honestly though the burritos and other various menu items seem to be made with high quality ingredients, quickly, and for a reasonable price. It is some pretty good football game food after a few beers. 

I would have to say that although I KNOW the food is good, to people walking by it may sort of seem like a dump. Some simple seating for you to devour your pile of food and no special decorations, or theme for that matter, within its walls. Once again though, I think of this place more as a place to refuel than an \"experience.\""}
{"text":"This is the best late night food around! Midnight any day of the week I know can rely on La Bamba. I get a regular sized burrito or a couple tacos; great meat selections, always have tasted fresh. They are heavy handed with the cilantro and onion, which I appreciate. Very kind staff, fast service. Accommodations in the restaurant are very basic but more isn't needed. Very affordable. Try it."}
{"text":"Great tacos de asada. I guess the nachos are pretty good too, but i stick to what i know best. The best drunk food on campus. Much better than any of the Bamba's in Chicago."}
{"text":"Went to Champaign over the weekend, was VERY disappointed to find that La Bamba has closed permanently."}
{"text":"Acceptable food at acceptable prices. 100 times better than Taco Bell, but the more modern burrito chains have got LaBAmba beat hands down. I used to be a fan when they were the only burrito in town but they need to freshen it all up a bit. 

They have become stagnant in their menu offers, so you're doomed eventually to get crushed by chipotles and moe's of the world."}
{"text":"I just love these people, I used to have my brother pick up food all the time when i was sick. I get the same 3 steak tacos, and rice, green sauce, my son gets super steak nachos! I enjoy good food and great customer service! They have it under control every time!"}
{"text":"Yummy, had the 2 taco and quesdilla with refried beans and rice. Fresh made quac.... Busy place, good food. Cook is super sweet Takes your order an makes the food. Generous portions. Great taste."}
{"text":"Average tacos. 

Coming from Milwaukee I can't say prices are good for the quality. 

Any alterations cost an arm and a leg. I saw a couple come in and order ten tacos, they added sour cream and avocado to all of them which doubles the cost. They weren't aware and it ended up making a scene. 

The manager pointed to the menu board, where the additional cost is not too obvious. 

Made a big scene and all of the diners were uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall burrito joint with the BEST beer-muchies burritos!  Super combo with everything and sour creme."}
{"text":"Good Mexican place
Super nachos are good.
I have great memories of coming here at 3am schwasted and if you asked me then I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I freakin love the taco meat and fresh ingredients here! I go during lunch quite often for a mini burrito and have never had a problem other than dry chicken, so I switched to the ground beef and thank goodness I did! Order the beef burrito with amazing Mexican white cheese, and freshly sliced avocado. I get onions and sour cream too.  I also love the fresh, soft, chewy tortilla! Oh and I just tried the chips and salsa today and I love it! The salsa reminds me of the good stuff at Laredos or Casa del Sol. I have no idea why there's never a line at the drive thru. Which is why I'm yelping!"}
{"text":"Always have loved LaBamba. Even waited in line for hours on their opening day when I worked at Target across the street(used to be there). Have made a point to go there regularly over the years and support them because I'd be sad if they went out of business. They've recently higher a guy, though that has now made it so I can no longer go there. Kind of a bigger guy with glasses that speaks perfect English(which is good) but he always wants you to list off 2,3 or 4 orders at the same time because he thinks he works at Custard Cup. Problem is he never keeps all of the orders straight so you have to watch him like a hawk and keep repeating things to him because he can't really remember. Then the burritos are never put together correctly, they're either a huge mess of torn tortillas or have so little ingredients that I might as well go to Taco Bell and get a beef and bean burrito. I've spoken to the owner about the guy several times, but this guy just keeps getting worse. I'm officially done. LaBamba is out of business in my mind from this point forward. It's too far to drive to be disappointed over and over again. RIP LaBamba."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
I am working on my Spanish and I ordered in Spanish. 
They were very patient with me and kind I got exactly what I ordered and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Authentic mexicans, I love the burritos, and they are willing to customize them. I get the super sized beef with no lettuce, added avocado, jalapeno and sour creme. I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes it hasn't always agreed w me. I think the lettuce was to blame, so I ask them to leave it out."}
{"text":"Food is ok..you have to know what's good..(fajitas and rice pretty much)...kinda pricey, open late....everything is extra and extra expensive ..a mini sour cream container costs .75c .cilantro is extra...soda is ridiculously priced...I always feel like I am getting ripped off when I buy food there..overall ok place to go when nothing else is opened"}
{"text":"How many La Bamba's are there out there now?  I dunno, but this was the first one!  It all started here ...

From a drunken-college-student-perspective, this is good solid food at 2:30 am, after a long night of drinking and dancing.  I kid you not, a friend of mine once ate two La Bamba super burritos in one sitting -- each one BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD!

But, from a hey-I-graduated-fifteen-years-ago perspective, I still think it's good food.  Granted, I haven't had a La Bamba's in years, but I recall that they had exceptionally tasty hot sauce."}
{"text":"Great burritos... dont forgrt thr hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Really good burritos \"as big as your head\". Ate at this place many times back in the day. On a recent trip back to Champaign I was disappointed to find that it was closed :("}
{"text":"Stopped in from the highway for a quick meal. Exactly what I wanted. Quick but still fresh. Very friendly service. Asked for no meat in my burrito and they offered to include fresh avocado as a replacement for no charge. They skimped on the salsa with the chips and salsa but have me more when I asked. Overall, solid food with quick and helpful service."}
{"text":"After a day of snowboarding at Devil's Head Wisconsin, we stopped by Madison, WI to look for a place to eat, before heading back to Chicago.

My friend suggested La Bamba.

OMG order the Super Nachos the chips they use is so good.  It has a different taste and crunch.  Warning, you must have friends to help you eat this.  They give quite a lot.  

I also tried a soft shell taco.  The shell made everything taste so good.  I wish they had a place in the burbs."}
{"text":"I got Nachos that look like a bird crapped on it, the chips were limp and soggy.

The beans were bland. 

Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate at the Chicago labamba on halsted location at least 3 times per week before they closed down. La bamba makes the best Mexican food and their sauce is amazing. This Madison WI location is great and people are so friendly. The guy making the food is awesome and has a great sense of humor. Best Mexican food you will ever have is made at la bamaba."}
{"text":"The burritos here must be based on a Man Vs Food episode because they are huge and delicious!  They also do some pretty good nachos. I just wish they offered hard shell tacos though."}
{"text":"I had a rather interesting first time experience at La Bamba. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat with a friend. We each ordered one steak taco. In Spanish we said, \"Un taco de asada.\" The cook was taking a rather long time to make two tacos, only to later see in front of us two huge steak MEALS. Apparently there was some miscommunication... He must have understood two steak meals, not two steak tacos. The manager was there with him and it was a rather awkward situation. No one was really saying anything. There were a lot of back and forth looks. I ended up being the one having to step up and speak. I told the manager I'd be willing to pay for one of the carne asade (steak) meals, but not both. My bill of what would have been 5 bucks turned into about $15. He sort of laughed off the situation and accepted my deal. It bothered me that I had to come up with a compromise when it was not my wrong doing. The meal was fine. It was a generous amount of meat served with red rice, beans, tortillas, and a huge grilled jalapeno. Does anyone actually eat the jalapeno? Just wondering. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't awesome. Honestly, the situation probably just left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Tasty steak and chicken burritos.  Get it with avocado!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for real mexican food.  I order their steak tacos all the time.  This is one of the online places I can find the picked jalepenos and carrots!  I don't know what the other reviewers are expecting.  This isn't the Ritz Carlton by any means, but they do a great job on their food.  The place is clean and the people are genuinely nice!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  It's West-Mex, basically a sit down version of Taco Johns but with less adobo seasoning.   I would've taken it, considering the food seemed not flavorful enough.  I got chicken tacos, rice and beans.  Everything was pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place. We ordered three burritos, one was served ice cold and the other two had hardly any meat- and it wasn't the meat we ordered. Totally disappointed and felt like we just wasted money."}
{"text":"Just as the one in Monona, I like La Bamba. They have very raw, \"you know what you're eating\" food. A lot of people who will probably low-rate this place prefer places like Pedros or Taco Bell with mystery sauces and fake ingredients abound. The food here is amazing with my favorite being the Veggie Nachos and Bean/avocado burrito. Hot sauce adds a lot of flavor to both and is absolutely necessary in my opinion to get the full experience."}
{"text":"huge burritos made from real deal ingredients and true Mexican spices and flavors. super burrito is a meal and a half and for only $8 you can't beat the price. I always get steak and add onions and peppers. I hold the cheese as I can't do lactose but still love these bad boys. super good red salsa with a kick. no crap where the burritos filled half full of rice either, no rice at all unless asked. fast service to. I only do take out here a couple times so can't speak on dine in."}
{"text":"Ordered a super burrito because I wanted a burrito as big as my head. It was huge. Took me 2 lunch and dinner to eat, and had a nap after the first crack at it due to food coma. Food quality not the best. Have had better Mexican (especially in champaign). Will only go once in a very long time."}
{"text":"What can i say, I was sober at 0245 and they closed at 0300, I Was greeted by two gentlemen wearing smiles and a can do attitude.  I ordered food and it was great, great, great, great!  I only tried the carne asada street tacos here with cilantro, onions, and white cheese and they were great, did i say how great they were yet?   

The bathrooms were clean, the floor appeared to be swept and upkept that late at night, there were people still sitting down, eating, watching the telly, and just generally enjoying themselves.  

This is not a hole in the wall place by any means but, it's got the taste of one if you know what I mean.  I did get to eyeball one of those burritos that i was hearing about and they are as large as folks are saying they are.  I should've gotten that but, I wasn't man enough after being a DD during new years."}
{"text":"Love this place. 
Good, fresh made food, that is not to pricey. It might be a chain, but does not taste like it. 
The hot sauce had something that so many other sauces don't have, flavor. This sauce brings a good heat, but has a flavor to it that adds to your meal."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. We have been on a road trip vacation for two weeks and we have relied on yelp for dinner every night. This was the first time we have had a bad meal. 

The tortilla chips were room temperature and tasted like they had been sitting out for three weeks. Three chicken taco salads at $8.50 each were tiny and were without chicken, beans or cheese. They were basically rice and lettuce on a plate. There was no value whatsoever in our meals. We would have been better off at Qdoba across the street to Chipolte a couple of doors down.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Two words: Super Burrito. It may not be as big as your head, but its as big as your late night appetite.  I suggest the steak version without beans.  However, they're very accommodating, so have them throw in some chorizo if you're feeling wiley."}
{"text":"I love eating here either to go or dine in. The staff is always friendly and willing to help. I usually get the super burrito but the nachos and tacos are good too. I love that they are up late to accommodate my midnight cravings."}
{"text":"I believe this was the original \"burritos as big as your head\" spot, now practically a conglomerate.  If your eyes are bigger than your stomach, god help you, but most average-sized people will be sated.  I was full after half a burrito.  There was something missing spice-wise in the preparation, but the end result still had decent flavor."}
{"text":"Poor Chorizo super burrito.  The Chorizo was basically on one side of the burrito and the lettuce and tomato were jaded.  Not ordering again."}
{"text":"By far the best fast food near East Towne; nothing comes even close.

Very good tacos, done right with onions and cilantro.

Quesedillas are a little 'gringo' but taste good. Burritos are pretty good, with nice sized portions.

Prices are right. Tacos are $2, burritos the usual $6-8. Definitely worth a stop if you can figure out how to get onto this side road that overlooks East Washington."}
{"text":"My coworker Rick has been telling me how great this place is for a very long time, I finally decide to try it the week I leave .. WTF was I thinking ... Why didn't I listen to him earlier ... OMG I love their hole in wall style mexican food ... Being from LA it brought back to east LA, it was very authentic ... They had tortas which I wanted to get but I decided to go with the burrito .. It was delish!!!  They grill it, and their salsa is La Bamba ...."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. We usually do Uber eats from here and I am never disappointed. The beans and rice are super tasty. They usually come with every dish. The cheese quesadilla an the chicken enchiladas are great! Both dishes are cheesy and have wonderful flavor. The prices here are super cheap for everything that you get. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I didn't wanna give the one star it deserves a minus one the food has turned super horrible the past couple years I I would rather eat jail food you could not give me  a burrito from this place for free but the lemonade is awesome"}
{"text":"my girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla and was given a beef quesadilla.  Last time I checked a beef quesadilla would be a taco not a quesadilla.  The shell was overly soggy and nasty. The ground beef had no seasoning or taste.  If this place is suppose to serve mexican food they have definitely missed the mark. Taco Bell does a better job and they are a fast food restaurant. The owner of this place needs to learn how to cook food properly."}
{"text":"Plenty of economical lunch options here! I went with the 2 taco and tamale combo, which comes with rice and beans and ran about $9. 

Tasty tacos! I enjoyed the steak and chicken, especially with the green salsa. Skip the tamale though. The pork meat was so dry, and the corn part was kind of dry as well. 

Lastly, if you're contemplating what to order, consider their slogan: \"burritos as big as your head!\""}
{"text":"Wow, kind of let down.  I have been to other locations and always received a pretty good meal.  Most likely between 3 and 4 stars.  On an early Saturday evening, I walked in to an empty restaurant.  I order the combo: two tacos and one quesadilla with rice and beans.  My order was to go.  I live about 7-8 minutes from there.  

When I got home my food was room temperature.  It was like they pre-cooked the meat and then just warmed it up quick when I got there.  My quesadilla was a bean taco, yup definitely NOT a quesadilla.  That is it.  Not impressive.  The side of rice was great.  The side of beans was salty.  It is just not what I am used to from other La Bamba visits.  

Step up your game."}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican fast food.  It's not Taco Bell, it's not Chipotle, it's not Laredo's or El Pastor or La Hacienda.  If you want sit down Mexican food go elsewhere, if you want fully Americanized Mexican food (i.e. lots of cheese) go elsewhere.  If you want a lot of grease surrounded by actual Mexicans also eating a lot of grease come here.

$0.99 ground beef tacos (again, no cheese unless you add it) and the Carne Asada are the best ways to spend your money here.  The burritos are huge and greasy.

They are open late, everything is prepared fresh, and the prices are ok to great depending.  Definitely one of my late night go-tos."}
{"text":"Wasnt sure if 4 or 5 was earned but gave it a 5 for overall....Was there on Saturday night (usually only go for a special late night meal after work).   Last time they forgot my quesadillas but lesson learned, check your order.

Very tasty, love the spicy mexican sausage.

I always leave some cash since they are very nice and accomodating...

Thanks Amigos!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Madison from Los Angeles, CA, I have been fiending for some legit tacos. I just tried La Bambas Tacos Al Pastor, and while they aren't what you'll get at a taco truck in East L.A., they are pretty darn good. My friends and I consider ourselves Taco Aficionados, and I will say that the 5 tacos and large horchata has me full and thoroughly satisfied. Definitely a must-try for some pretty-darn-close-to-110% authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Food didn't look fresh and was pretty flavorless.  My plate was sloppily put together.  The refried beans look like they have an artificial light purple color to them. Service was slow and unprofessional.  The place needs a good cleaning and update."}
{"text":"La Bamba where the burritos are as big as your head.  I suppose this would be true if I had Beetlejuice's head after he gets it shrunken by the voodoo guy.  They aren't as big as your head, so if you go in there thinking you are going to nosh on a seriously huge burrito, you are going to be let down.  Just when you think \"oh well, maybe it'll at least taste good,\" you find out the disappointing truth, the burritos are bland and full of dry rice.  Booooo!  The path to gigantic burrito enlightenment is not here my friends, just keep on drivin' by."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his brother seem to love this place; They get the steak burritos and find them amazing. I decided to visit one day, and I must say that I'm not too impressed with this place.

The decor and inside of the restaurant was drab and shabby and made me feel uncomfortable. I ordered a burrito with chorizo and it was very bland. The chorizo lacked any good flavor and the burrito as a whole was simply unsatisfying. It's very greasy and runny and even the sour cream is like liquid.

I don't recommend this place for \"authentic\" Mexican food because if this place is truly authentic then authentic Mexican food must taste like trash. I would much rather get my authentic Mexican food at Fiesta Ranchero in McMinnville, TN."}
{"text":"My guess is that their burritos do not typically feature plastic in the filling, but I will not be returning a second time to find out if this was an accident or a trend.  You can keep your burritos de plástico, La Bamba."}
{"text":"Just no. Maybe I ordered the wrong item off the menu but I don't think changing my order would have changed my mind. 

Stopped in for lunch, to-go order. There was one person eating other than that the restaurant sat empty. Both trash cans had plates of food piling up. Overall look of the place wasn't very clean. Maybe I should have walked out then? But I didn't. 

After looking over the menu I ordered the meat quesadilla, with steak and a side of rice. I asked for no tomatoes, which they followed through with. Typically I always end up with tomatoes. I paid and within 2-3 minutes my food was ready. I looked in the bag and noticed no rice. I asked for the rice and another guy on the phone started to ask for an additional $2 after I already paid. I paid, grabbed my food and left. 

The quesadilla is NOT a quesadilla, it was more of a soggy flat burrito. Loaded with beans, lettuce, some meat, onions, and very little if any cheese.. What?! It was impossible to pick up. I had to used a knife and fork, which wouldn't have been a big deal but it truly had no flavor. The steak was the size of ground beef again with little to no flavor. Super disappointing. 

The saving grace was the rice. It had flavor, and had a great consistency. Often times I find rice can be over cooked and mushy but not this rice. 

Would I eat here again? Nope. Okay maybe an order of rice but anything else is a big no. They are known for their burritos, so that could have been my mistake but honestly how can you screw up a quesadilla??"}
{"text":"Is Bigger Always Better?

I guess it depends on who you ask.

Personally, I've always thought of length and girth as being far less important than taste and deliciousness.

Wait...We are talking about the same thing, right?

Anyway, my work-partner and I were in Madison making deliveries the other day and he said that we absolutely had to go to La Bamba for one of their gigantic super-burritos.  It wasn't just his interpretation, they have a gigantic hand-painted mural on the wall when you walk in that says \"Burritos As Big As Your Head!!

I gather it's a point of pride.

Service was awesome, if a bit cheesy.  The guy working the grill yells out \"HOLA AMIGOS!\" to everyone that walks in and was super pleasant.

Decor is pretty spartan, it's strictly some cheap tables and booths, plastic silverware, and ESPN Deportes on a telly.  But as I've said before, I would happily eat in a Stalinist gulag if the borscht was delicious.

Super Burrito?  Definitely huge.  Definitely messy.  Definitely maybe sub-super.  I mean, it was good.  Don't get me wrong.  But it wasn't like, blow-me-away-amazing.

I got the pork and it was more like ground pork than some kind of actual pork texture.  They also put lettuce in the burrito which is a huge turn-off for me.  The salsa, even the secret green stuff that you have to ask for wasn't very hot at all.

I'll eat there again, but I won't have the pork.  Will be sure to update when I've had something else from their menu."}
{"text":"Another mexican place that has made me vomit immediately after the meal - tasty going down for sure (good hot sauce) but digestively questionable.  Beware."}
{"text":"This is exactly the type of Mexican joint you would expect in a college town. It's fairly cheap, fast, and they are open late as fuck on the weekends so you can sop up all that alcohol you just drank. Although the burritos are their main advertising point I would say they are about on par with chipotle.

If you go on Sunday or Tuesday the beef tacos are on sale and you can get three for under 4 dollars, which is what I go there for. The hot sauce is really, really good so make sure you get some extra."}
{"text":"While the value is pretty good, the burritos are not really that huge (come on people, be real) and their quality is very low. Every type of meat I've had there has been dry and stringy; the beef in particular was barely edible. The burritos sometimes aren't even assembled that solidly, which may be due to the size, but still they shouldn't fall apart and have such a messy puddle of dripping in the bottom of every wrapper. I've been here 3 times and I'm never going back. It's a step above generic Americanized places like Qdoba and Chipotle, but it's still really, really low quality food for drunk people who can't tell the difference. Go to Los Amigos if you want decent Mexican food on Green Street."}
{"text":"The front counter lady sneezing without covering up should have been the only sign I needed, but I had already handed her my card to pay for the food. When we received the food, it was good, not great AND my husband and I had to pay the price for it for a whole week after, if you know what I mean. I say nay! Never again!"}
{"text":"mmmm.  the veggie taco.  yummy rice with all the veggies you expect in a taco.  there is just something about an authentic taco joint though that gives you a deeper taco experience.  i think it has to do with the soft, warm corn tortillas...love the drive thru so you don't even have to get out of your car on a frigid evening in champaign."}
{"text":"Their steak burrito is KING! Their burritos are as close to a Cali burrito as you'll find around these parts. I was so sad when the La Bamba in Appleton closed. Now we visit the Madison location whenever we are in town. Still one of my favorite burritos to this day!!"}
{"text":"Oh Bamba. How can you get a quesadilla of all things so wrong? Description listed it came with beans. Got home. No beans. 

It was floppy, soggy and barely warm. You put lettuce inside, thus I couldn't toast it and salvage it."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember when I was a kid (much more grease over the past couple of years), but still a place everyone should experience. Their hot sauce is the BEST!! My husband asked why they didn't sell it by the bottle. Apparently, it is made from all fresh ingredients. To bottle it would ruin the flavor because of all of the preservatives. Bummer, because now I live in California and can only dream about the burritos!"}
{"text":"Circa early 2000's, this was my favorite spot for late night food when there was a location just off Green Street.  The super nachos are absolutely still one of the best nachos around due to the queso blanco they use which seems to be rare nowadays.  If you aren't familiar with tortas, they are a mexican sandwich made with a spread of refried beans, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and a meat--preferably chorizo.  This was the first place I'd ever had one, and also I feel the best.  Traditionally, La bamba's is know for their burritos as big as your head aka the \"super burrito\" which does not disappoint.  If this place is still as good as it used to be, worth a  try."}
{"text":"My favorite for cheap, fast Mexican food. Love the flour quesadillas and the beans with cheese on top. They will put cilantro on your order if you ask."}
{"text":"The Groupon was finally used on the last day! Umph. Nice guys working here, full of jokes, and who doesn't like a Groupon deal. That being said, don't expect much more past that. The burrito was skimped on the meat, no avocado, not even rice, minus the cilantro, and the salsa needs some improvement. Kind of on the Anglo side of the taste scale for a taqueria, just saying.  It was filling, but I will be elsewhere for Mexican eats."}
{"text":"Yes! Labamba is the best burrito joint ever! I'm so happy they have expanded. They used to be located off State Street- ONLY! Everyone has to try the \"big as your head\" burrito at least once in their life. Food is made fresh right in front of you. Labamba is open very late, well after bar time. This is the best thing to eat after a night out! They hand out their red salsa which is great but ask for their green salsa- amazing! Must go here if you are visiting Madison."}
{"text":"This place should really be called \"La Basura.\"

All joking aside, a friend and I each ordered one of those \"Burritos as Big as Your Head\" (or whatever that sign says at the front of the store), and I don't know what the heck is in that meat, but it was utterly disgusting. About a quarter of the way through that burrito, I threw it away.

Taco Johns, Taco Bell, you name it, it will likely do a better job than this place. I don't get how this place is in business. Obviously, I'm not coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is a good Americanized Mexican food joint.  I adore the fact they have chorizo.  Definetely great on super nachos and tortas.  The price for me is a little more than I'd like to spend and not so healthy.. so I don't come here too often.  But it's still good.

Good drunk food though... this place is packed after the bars close.

The people who work there aren't too friendly and the bathroom is pretty disgusting (one person bathroom.. no mirror.. and nasty pink soap in a dish).  They need to work on that."}
{"text":"The food and the staff here are gross, but........  I do believe they have the best salsa in the city.  I come here for rice and salsa only!"}
{"text":"The food's greasy and really isn't a good combination with alcohol unless you have a really good book in the bathroom.

Nevertheless I still crave the chicken salad once in a while.  I would get it with all the fix'ns:  chihuahua cheese, peppers, sour cream, avocado (not guac... avocado :) ), extra hot sauce... (which they make fresh, btw) 

I never thought that I'd miss this place, but man I do.  I've had few dishes at any Mexican place that I've enjoyed as much as their chicken salad.

Oh and if you do get the chicken salad, get it to go.  You get waaaaay more."}
{"text":"Oh dear. 

First of all, yes, the burritos are enormous. Not quite as big as my head, but definitely as big as a venti frappuccino, and much more filling. 

This was not the first La Bamba, as asserted. It was the first one in Champaign, but the chain started elsewhere. 

This place is open late into the night, and that is the best reason to go there. In daylight, there are better choices. 

That said, I still get a hankering for these sometimes. Fortunately I live in the land of great burritos now. Yay burritos!"}
{"text":"I ate here at their grand opening when they used to be next to a mens clothing store

I was 12

I said when I grow up, I wanna go to school HERE.

Boy, was I wrong."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. So going to a place that advertises a burrito that is as big as my head seems like a no-brainer. After all, I do have a big head. It was tasty but unremarkable. Also, what kind of Mexican place doesn't have guacamole? At least it was fairly inexpensive. I'd try it again, maybe the tacos this time."}
{"text":"Steve L put it as good as one can say: \"It's a college town burrito chain...\" If I was drunk, it was late and I wanted to eat something, this would suffice. However, sober, its disgusting. There are only refried beans. The fillings in a veggie burrito consist of rice and hot sauce and refried beans. Mexican, its not. Good it is not. Cheap, I guess. There is better out there. There is much better out there."}
{"text":"Worst quesodilla i have ever had.  It was more lettuce and beans than actual cheese which I'm pretty sure is not how a quesodilla is normally made."}
{"text":"I'm usually wordier than this but trust me don't go here. Some of the most flavorless Mexican food I've ever had. Avoid avoid avoid. I wasn't dirty it that is a postive. Tamales were old and reheated in the microwave until leaden. The taco salad was more some rice and iceberg. Avoid Avoid Avoid."}
{"text":"Super.  Nachos.

That's all you need to know.  Sure, the burritos are (almost) as big as your head, but who wants a cabeza-sized burrito?  Super nachos loaded with steak, white cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream...mmmm, that's all you need.  I have fond college memories of coming here drunk at 2 A.M.  Everyone else is drunk too, which can be either hilarious or obnoxious.  One time, two of my girlfriends and I were accosted inside by three VERY sketchy guys, one of whom was MISSING AN EYE.  That should probably tell you something about the late night environment."}
{"text":"Im writing this one for the unhappy reviewer who stopped while on a road trip, just to clarify the La Bamba experience for any other Yelpers. La Bamba is a college town restaurant, famous for serving burritos to drunk college students when the drunk parade starts after the bars close.  La Bamba burritos as big as your head are well loved and well remembered by many Big 10 students.  

The Madison location used to be just off State Street, but moved out to the burbs some years ago.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cold and cafeteria style; get your food, eat and get on your way.  I would not go here for a sit down Mexican meal.  Most folks go for one thing - the burritos.

My personal fave is the mini combo con todo!  Including that famous hot sauce.  It's been sixteen years since I graduated college, but every time we drive by East Wash we have to jump off 94 to get a La Bamba.  You crave them, wolf them down, and then think, meh.  It's alright.  (Not as good as at 3:00 a.m. after many many cheap tap beers).  The tacos are good as well, and they do have pastor.

I even pack a cooler and haul some up to my old college roomie in Mnpls.

Hint:  they taste even better the next day, after refrigeration for a day, and they do freeze well.

So if you want to try this wonderful burrito as big as your head experience, have at it.  If you want a nice Mex-American meal with frozen margaritas, this is not your place."}
{"text":"So their catchphrase is \"burritos larger than your head.\" The burritos are certainly big. I will say that I did enjoy the quesadillas here too. The burritos were pretty good."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  Long story short went there on a Sunday afternoon to the drive-thru.  Ordered a regular burrito and a taco salad.  The burrito was sooooo small it was ridiculous.  They didn't even fill the shell.  The taco salad did not taste good and the rice was mushy (old).  There were hardly any tortilla chips and it looked like it was just thrown in there.  I returned the food and the two asshole workers behind the counter ignored me after I said I wanted my money back.  They proceeded to inspect the food which was still intact and talked in Spanish to each other.  Very rude to speak another language in front of a customer and I told them to speak English so I could understand what they were saying.  The fat asshole manager who always gives shitty service and crappy food told me he could talk in whatever language he wanted.  I again said I want my money back and he proceeded to slam the food in the garbage like a child.  This food was $17!!   The food is pricey and was not good.  The service was even worse.  I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Not going to eat here again, burrito as big as my head and tastes the same as my head would. Ground beef nasty can do better for the same price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Incredible! The super combo is what it's all about. Ordered 2 to take home with me because who knows when I will get it again. Love the sauce too, they make it there. All the times I've been to a la bamba they haves always made my burrito correctly. I can't wait to go back. Wish we had one in St Louis. Anywhere around st louis would be fine. Please give us a la bamba in the st louis area!"}
{"text":"Dear God,

Thank you for letting La Bamba be a thing. I don't know how many times I've needed a super burrito with steak to kill a nasty post football game or Dells hangover. Thank you for allowing the staff to be kind enough not to judge my friends and I today for being so sunburned we couldn't move.  Thank you for letting them serve the best hot sauce on earth. Thank you for somehow rigging things so I had to stay at the shitty Best Western across the street for a week while working in Madison. I don't hold the 10 pounds I gained eating here every night against you. 

              Good luck with heaven and stuff,
                                     Kyle K

P.S. If you are as cool as Billy Graham says you are you'll let a La Bamba open in Milwaukee.  If you do I just might stop making the spaghetti monster joke about you."}
{"text":"Big portions for modest prices. I usually get it to go. Think of it as a better Taco Bell and you'll dig this place.

Fajitas dinner combo had 8 tortillas and a very generous helping of rice and beans, easy to split between multiple meals.

Half of their huge burritos could easily compare to a modest chipotle burrito."}
{"text":"\"The late night Mexican place\" in Champaign. You think you wait in long lines in Chicago try coming to this place on a Saturday night at 3am!!! The food of course is your typical fast food Mexican but it's still good. The chips and salsa are my fav."}
{"text":"I really like the tacos here, they are on soft corn tortillas. Tuesday and Sunday are .99 tacos. My friend tried the nachos and didn't like it, the chips were a bit stale and when we they asked if we wanted everything on it, we said yes, expecting the normal toppings but they threw lettuce on the hot fake nacho cheese and sour cream. I have back to this place a few times and I've learned my lesson to always get the tacos. Great price and fills me up."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
It is a bit of a misnomer when you call you \"burritos as big as your head\". I would have to say the length of the burrito is the size of your head, but it is also super skinny as well. I tried the La Bamba burrito served with your choice of meat, beans, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and hot sauce and was less than impressed. Chiptole hands down has deeper flavors and chunks of steak vs. the burrito meat here which is diced up and greasy as well. Maybe I am use to americanized burritos but somehow the flavor was not that exciting. The hot salsa simply made it very spicy.

Pros: none

Cons: parking lot is a bit run down, the burrito is sort of big, disappointing flavors

Hidden deals:
I forgot but they have one day where tacos are discounted"}
{"text":"It was just ok.  I had to try the super burrito advertised \"as big as your head\".  Drove out to Champaign from Forsyth for the afternoon and had to try it.  It was not anything special and I would not eat there again but it was a good one time thing. Burrito was just like a burrito that you could get anywhere else; chicken with some type of seasoning, lettuce, onion, etc rolled up in a giant tortilla."}
{"text":"Been coming here for YEARS (close to a decade).... still not sick of it.  I stick with the steak tacos, although burritos are good.  

Definitely \"authentic mexicans\" working here, without a doubt.  A lot of them don't speak the best english, so it's good to make sure you either a) tell them what you want in Spanish or b) repeat your order SEVERAL TIMES.  I had issues with them always putting onions on my tacos/burritos but now have it down to a science the best way to prevent this.  They tend to be a little forgetful and don't have fancy taco-bell-style video screens showing each order, so you gotta have a strategy if you're picky about your toppings.

Definitely not the best, and not really cheap either, but ... I'm hooked.  Open ridiculously late every night, too."}
{"text":"Best flipping nachos ever !!!!!! Will be going back for them again soon and it's not expensive at all"}
{"text":"I really like the food... I'm not going to lie this is 5 star food if you're drunk.  Which is completely awesome!  It's 4 star for any other time because it makes the quota for having veg options and really good flavor and they've cleaned it up a lot! I just don't like how sometimes it's too cold and It's very bare.... but those are my only complaints! The people who work there are always sweeet!!!"}
