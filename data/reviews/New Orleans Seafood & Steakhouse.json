{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the GTA. I've probably had half or more of the items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. From Jumbalaya, Steak, Fish of the Day, Blackened Chicken, Fishermans Plate, Chicken Creole Pasta and they have all been amazing. The desserts are just as good.

Whether it's the owner or waitresses the service doesn't get any better. They were all very friendly and attentive to our needs.

Considering where the restaurant is you would never expect such a good meal."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend. Absolutely delicious food and wonderful service. We had the crab cakes (they even put each crab cake with an individual salad on separate plates so we could each have one). We had the Jambalaya for 2 and it was wonderful. We couldn't even finish it.
All the waiters were very nice so the service was perfect. 
Will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Awesome food, friendly staff and owner, and great service. It's on the pricey side, but SO worth it."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem!!! Amazing all the way around and don't let the outside fool you, this place is all class and great food on the inside!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem in Toronto. Not many Cajun or creole cuisine in town and this is a place that is a lot closer than Dick & Jenny's across the border in Grand Island NY. We have been taking out-of-towners here over the years and they have all remarked on the memorable food and service and tonight was no different. Casual and intimate service with New Orleans jazz music playing in the background, we truly enjoyed various appetizers, the daily fish specials, seafood creole pasta and a pecan pie dessert. Highly recommended for something a little different and unpretentious in the ever-evolving restaurant scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best! Mike was the greatest host I've ever had. So friendly and accommodating.  It was my girlfriends birthday and I brought cup cakes, Mike brought them into the kitchen and decorated them with berries and mint leaves and lit some candles. Then he brought us Birthday shots! The guy is amazing. Thanks Mike!

The food was great. I recommend the salmon or bass \"fish of the day\" dish."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner with a party of six in early December.
Mike took great care of us.
Food was excellent and he was bang on with his wine recommendation with the meal.
Since most of our party is Croatian, we were sharing Mike's background, it was a fun evening.
And he bought us dessert.
Thanks a bunch"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight and I need to write a review.  So amazing.  I'm so thankful for Yelp or else I would never have found this place.  One of those hidden gems that you would never think to go to from seeing it on the outside.  I've lived in Etobicoke all my life and although I have driven past this place so many times I had never even noticed it.

We came about 7:30 on a Thursday and it was pretty busy.  I did make a reservation as people had mentioned in the reviews that it can get busy.  It's a small little restaurant that is decorated in a very cosy way fitting with the New Orleans theme, burgundy walls, brass instruments hung on the walls.  

The bread they bring out is warm and excellent but make sure you don't gorge yourself on it as the serving sizes are very generous here.  We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer (which many here recommended) and OMG.  Super fresh, no fishy taste, absolutely delicious.  Plated with a cute mini size salad wrapped in a cucumber slice.  I probably could have ordered a whole meal of just crab cakes to be honest. 

There were 3 of us, one of us ordered a rib eye seak and two of us decided to order the Jambalaya for 2.  It does say on the menu that if you order the Jambalaya it will take 30 mins or so to prepare so just keep this in mind, if you are short on time you might want to order as soon as you get there or maybe even call ahead.  OMG, they really should call it the Jambalaya for 3 because the serving size is HUGE (pic attached).  It was probably our fault for eating alot of the delicious bread but we only were able to finish about 3/4ths and were incredibly full after.  It was absolutely amazing.  Crawfish, whitefish, sausage, free-range chicken, shrimps, mussels baked in stewed rice with cajun spices with fresh herbs on top.  The whole thing tasted incredibly fresh.  My dad had the steak which came with veggies and he said it was excellent as well.  We were so full after we could barely move but we decided to share a key lime sorbet for dessert which had fresh berries and peppermint on top, which was the perfect palate cleanser for an amazing meal.

As others here have mentioned, what really sets this place apart is the impeccable level of service.  There was 2 waiters, one of whom was one of the owners (his wife is the chef!) and he was just excellent.  Although it was busy he made sure we were happy with our meals, cracked jokes and was just generally very kind.  After our meal, he even brought us a complimentary shot of liquor! We were talking with him after and you can tell he is very passionate about his business.  He said they are a pretty simple restaurant and they try to do what they do well, which I agree with.  He said they have been in business for 19 years and most of their clientele is repeat customers.  We will definitely be coming back in the future, this place is such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Walked in, unsure of what to expect and was so pleasantly surprised at the warm  
and welcoming service, delicious meal and cozy ambiance. We had the crab cakes- probably the best ones I ve ever had, as well as the creole seafood pasta and the special of the day, which was monk fish- so flavourful and delicious, it was absolutely made with love. Our waiter was one of the owners, absolutely the sweetest, kindest man who was so passionate about the place, it really made us so happy to be there! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and i found this resto based on reviews from trip advisor. Everything we have tried on the menu is mouth watering from the fresh seafood to the tenderloin. The owner is always great and makes you feel at home. Definitely a must try (and i have eaten at michelin star restos)"}
{"text":"We just celebrated our 10 year anniversary and decided we wanted to try this restaurant as part of our celebration.  We were NOT sorry! The food here is nothing short of excellent. My husband and I cleaned our plates; something we rarely do when dining out.
The service was fantastic - from the servers to the owner, we were treated nicely by each person we encountered. And the food...so GOOD!  Try the crab cakes, seafood gumbo, pecan pie...I could go on!  We ended the night with dessert: key lime sherbet and pecan pie, compliments of the restaurant as our anniversary gift. So kind of the owner to do so! 
Do yourself a favor and grab a few friends/family members and head over to New Orleans for fantastic food and courteous customer service.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I have had. Food was amazing, staff was very friendly and attentive - anything we needed, they were there instantly without needing to flag them - and the atmosphere was great. The portions are VERY generous as each main qualified as a complete meal by itself."}
{"text":"First timer, I went with a friend. We shared the scallop appetizer and spinach salad. The presentation was beautiful, loved the salad bowl made of a very large wrapped sliced cucumber. We each got one savoury scallop that was out of this world tender--small appetizer. Recommended."}
{"text":"I went with my family last night. The food was exceptional.  Mike, the owner, provided great service, he was friendly, attentive, and very welcoming. Mike's wife is a fantastic chef.  The blackened fish was perfect, and the vegetable were perfectly cooked.  All of us enjoyed our meal.  Mike really wants you to enjoy your time at his restaurant. We will definitely return.  

Also, he sources meat and fish from the best suppliers in Toronto."}
{"text":"The service here is incredible. I dropped in one evening with my wife and kids. Despite being booked solid, they got us a table (we just had to be out before the next reservation, which was fine). Food was great. A little too spicy for our kids, but they did okay. The owner even treated them to ice cream for being well behaved.

Wonderfully cozy atmosphere, staff always attentive but not overbearing. Definitely easy to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super mixed feelings about this place

Pros: This area (Scarlett road and Eglinton) is a wasteland devoid of all culinary richness, so anything to ameliorate that is a welcome.  The food seems decent.  The staff are nice in a kind of weird way. 

Cons: Service was slow AF. 

Place is in a tiny strip mall. Clientele are middle aged to older white suburban folks. 

We get seated and the waitress says \"Ok how about we get you started with some drinks?\" We said we just want water. She said \"ok great\" and smiled, but it was one of those smiles that was like \"I bet these cheap water drinking bastards are not going to give me a good tip but my job requires me to smile so I will smile at them.\" It's like you're on a first date and you suggest you go for tacos and your date tells you she doesn't eat tacos because they are emblematic of the legacy of repression and cultural appropriation foisted upon the latinx peoples and she will not be a party to reproducing those colonial racist narratives, and you smile at her and say \"ok great!\" as you think oh jesus god what have I gotten myself into?  Maybe I was reading too much into it.

Anywho we order the Jambalaya because that's their thing.  The menu warns it takes 35 minutes to make and it did. It came, super steamy mouth burny hot, so be careful.  It was good, it was decent, I liked it, but for $60 it didn't knock my socks off.  Am I glad I tried it? Yeah. Would I come back and get it again? Probably not. 

So anyway it's huge and even for two people it's way way too huge. So Mike (I'm guessing he's Mike because other Yelp reviewers talk about how nice Mike is) is this older kinda chubby white grandfatherly dude who I see walking around the restaurant chatting with folks. I assume he's the owner because while the other two waitresses are busting their asses with a restaurant full of customers on a Friday night he's sauntering around chatting up folks and he also is the only one who takes the payments.  Anyway he comes by and asks how our food is, I say good, but can we get a takeaway container for the rest of the Jambalaya?  He says \"No no, take your time, take your time\" and then just walks away. Wait what? 

After dinner our waitress comes and reads the desert options, and I remember I checked online and they had \"Banana Foster\" which looked interesting and I ask her if they have it because she didn't mention it.  She says she'll have to ask the kitchen if they can make it because if it's really busy they won't make it. Okay.. She leaves and.. doesn't come back.  Like fifteen minutes later she still isn't back (this is a small restaurant with only one room) so I don't know if she went on break or perhaps she decided that would be an opportune moment to quit and run away to Madagascar with her lover, or what but she didn't come back.  Eventually another waitress asks us if we want desert, I said I wanted the banana foster, she says she will check with the kitchen if they can make it.  Oh god I think, what if the same fate befalls her? What if this is like some teen horror movie where they always split up and decide to explore different parts of the building alone and the killer always hunts them down one by one \"DON'T GO IN THE KITCHEN!\" I want to scream.. \"THE LAST ONE WHO DID NEVER CAME OUT ALIVE!\" but she does... anyway she comes back a few minutes later and says no problem they can make it. Cool.   

We get the desert and the banana foster is pretty good, the syrup is crazy sweet though.  Then we want to pay.  We want to pay but we cannot pay, the waitresses are both running around like crazy (oh the first one finally did re-emerge from the kitchen so I guess she didn't run away and/or get murdered), and Mike is doing his folksy thing at the other tables, we sit for like 20 minutes with our empty plates in front of us. I mean, I know, first world problems right? It was fine I was just chatting with my companion but like Zzzzz, finally I flag down a waitress and ask to pay.  They give us the bill in a big folder that boldly states  WE PROUDLY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS.  I put my American Express card in the folder, and wait for Mike to come over with the machine. \"Oh sorry we don't accept American Express. We accepted it for 16 years but not any more.\"  The 16 years thing was weirdly specific but, ok I paid with Mastercard. 

Then Mike says hey this is your first time here right? How bout I bring you a little aperitif thing on the house. And we are like sure. So he brings us these little glasses of liqueur, not sure what it was but it tasted like an After Eight mint. Anyway that was nice and all but I mean, how about you bring us the thing we actually asked for and wanted (the takeaway box) when we asked for it.  I cannot say such terrible things to such a folksy grandfatherly man, so I do not.  Bottom line, decent food, service is weird/nice?/slow."}
{"text":"Just got home from a lovely dinner at the New Orleans restaurant. First time. Will be back again soon.
The crab cakes were better than imagined. Delish!!!!! I could have bathed in the Remoulade sauce. 
Fish of the day was Grouper. Very nicely done. Lamb chops had potential, had some of them not been overcooked.
The owner is an absolute charmer. His wife is the Chef. 
A great experience all around. Please try it out."}
{"text":"The place is small but has a nice atmosphere. The manager is really friendly and served us dinner. We had the calamari and shrimps to start and the jambalaya for our entree with crab cakes. The appetizers and crab cakes were really good but we didn't like the jambalaya too much. On another occasion I had a pasta dish which was average. I would come back and just order a bunch of crab cakes. They're really good but expensive."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing... You can't ask for more the food is absolutely delicious and the service is wonderful everyone is polite and they make all their food fresh! A must that you need to try is the coconut shrimp and crab cakes for appetizers, I highly recommend eating at this restaurant once you go once you'll want to go again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! We live in the area and decided to check it out! From the moment entering, the staff greeted us like family and presented us with comfort and and class. We had the scallops and crab cakes for appetizers, wow amazing! For dinner we had red snapper and my husband had rib eye steak with vegebales and rice. We both said this is the best quality we have experienced for a long long time. Absolutely quality favorable food, done to perfection, combined with amazing service and perfect food presentation. If you are looking for class, this is it! Worth every penny and more. Dont be fooled by location. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I now know why everyone have rated this restuarant 5 stars.   Food was beyond excellent as it came hand and hand with the above and beyond excellent service.  We came here for a casual dinner to try out as we were in the area and it surpassed our expectation 200%.  In fact I don't think I even wrote a review for G. R.  in Vegas!   We will be sure to recommend this restuarant to everyone we know. . What a hidden gem!!!!!!   We also had the pleasure of meeting the chef who was also  very humble.  It's rare to see these days.   Excellent, Excellent food complimented by Excellent, Excellent Service!!!  See you again soon! 
Sonia and Chris.  
P.S. We will be checking website often for new menu items. . Wink wink!"}
{"text":"Just tried booking at our favourite restaurant for an early New Year's Eve dinner.  I guess word has gotten out about New Orleans and Mike!  I am really sorry we didn't plan ahead!  Never once have I been disappointed in this restaurant and I have been coming since Before mike moved to Oakville.  Have to agree with an earlier review of the beef tenderloin - my favourite.  But my fish loving friends never have anything but praise for New Orleans.

Happy New Year"}
{"text":"Friends told us about this place. It is indeed worth the trip. Do not be fooled from the outside: does not seem to be a nice place. Inside is nice and quiet. I ordered the blacken fish and my husband ordered the beef tenderloin. They both are cooked with perfection. The pepper sauce for beef tenderloin is to die for. 
We are definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"The service, the food, the staff, the management all  phenomenal. Dinner for six for a birthday. All had jambalaya for two, huge portions can serve at least three. Not shy with the ingredients lots of sausage fish and seafood. The gentleman there I believe to be the owner had great personality and really a happy people person. Great menu and wine list. You don't even get to pour your own wine, service so on point by the time your glass empty they filling it back up"}
{"text":"Food is very good here, but the service was really lacking. They do not have anywhere close to the service staff necessary to run the restaurant during busy times (Friday, Saturday). A simple ask for water/wine refill takes a ridiculously long time. Please fix your service and will write another review for 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I forgot to write a review as I promised myself I would... 3 yrs and 15+ visits later I'm now remembering to do so! 

Our most recent sitting was NYE, what can I say.... It was incredible, as always. My below reviews, I can say with certainty has been the same for all of my visits. 

Food- 5 stars- freaking awesome! Menu stays the same (thank god) and I don't think ice had such consistent great food. I've tried almost everything on their menu and they are all great but my favourites are (calamari, fisherman platter and the sea bass)

Service- 5 stars- simple but amazing.  Small family restaurant,  we have had the same server Mike  (owner) almost every visit,  the other times was his son.  His wife is the head chef and she is phenomenal. 

Value- 5 stars. I have never, EVER felt that I'm not getting a great value here. Prices for the portions and quality of what you get is very fair. 

Ambiance- 3/4 stars- Love the location, great resto outside of Toronto. Easy to park and get to. It is a nice place and a good environment but it's good. The ambiance is simple and clean but nothing too fancy  If you want a romantic setting for a special occasion this may not be the best but it's a great place for as date night etc. 

I would love to see this place extend generations so we can always continue to enjoy this place forever."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection from beginning to end! The atmosphere is cozy, the family owners are beyond lovely and probably some of the nicest, friendliest, warmest people I've ever met. The food is amazing, very authentic, super fresh, and all homemade down to each of the sauces, and even the most delicious homemade ice cream that they brought for my father-in-law's bday with a candle, and sang, when  no one even told them it was his bday!! Customer service does NOT get any better than this! Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I've had this type of customer service.  The owner is super friendly and loves to crack jokes.   The gumbo came out perfectly hot on a cold winter night (my pet peeve is having luke warm soup), and the jambalaya is filled with a lot of fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Great food. Attentive staff. Took us in even though we didn't have a reservation. As a courtesy, we left after an appropriate time in order to make way for those with reservations. It's not a very large establishment but it's cozy. 
Will definitely recommend. Will definitely return. Thank you very much for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Why go to New Orleans for food when you can just come here? This restaurant has it all: good food, great staff, and awesome vibes! Ordered the crab cakes and jambalaya and both were mouth-watering good! The waiter was also super friendly and really funny. Definitely coming back to try the gumbo and maybe some of the other seafood dishes!"}
{"text":"An amazing find and incredible flavor. Presentation was great, Quality was 5 Star, Service Impeccable. They were attentive, had a nice wine selection and provided a fine dining experience.
I will be returning and I highly recommend the little gem!"}
{"text":"I gave this a 4 because it doesn't deserve a perfect review for a few reasons (I'll get to that soon enough).

The good:
-some of the best crab cakes I've had in the city
-it comes off as a family run business with extremely nice staff
-you will hear \"thank you, I like, I like\" when you finish your plate
-the food is delicious and the presentation is lovely
-survived in a quiet suburban plaza hidden from everyone and everything. 

Why it didn't get a 5:
-it's hidden in a quiet suburban plaza hidden from everyone and everything
-it's expensive (but the food is great)
-I walked & drove by it numerous times before going in... I used to argue with my wife about it being a drug cover up because there was \"no way anyone is going to come and eat southern food here\" 

It turned out to be a hidden gem"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Came here with my husband for my birthday and what a pleasant surprise. We had made reservation for 6:30pm but arrived half hour early at 6pm - owner Mike was there to welcome us and seated us right away in the small but intimate dining room. The trees in the dining room adds open air feel and almost feel like we were in an open courtyard.

Can I say how amazing the bread was? They were warm, crispy on the ouside, airy and soft on the inside. We didn't arrive too hungry but we downed the bread in no time! We went with the specials of the day crab cake and paired with calamarie for appertizer. The appetiziers came out beautifully split with salad wrapped in cucumber for me and my husband. The food were delicious and perfectly cooked - seafood were fresh and juicy (never the rubbery taste) and beautifully plated. We shared the Jambalaya for two - this could easily feed 6 people if you ordered appetiziers. This was the best Jambalaya we've ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and filled with meat/sausage/fish and less than half is rice, unlike places that fill you up on rice. All the ingredients tasted very fresh and perfectly cooked. Chicken was soft and juicy, fish was soft and tender, mussles were great and crawfish were delish. 

During appertizer, my husband had spoken to Mike about my birthday and we were treated with caramel flan with fresh berries and candle. Mike also brought out a shot for each of us - perhaps sweet brandy - and congratulated us. 

The service was attentive and we occasionally got the \"I'm very happy you emptied the plate\" from Mike. Mike is the most friendly host we've ever met - he is open to talk about anything, and we noticed he happily accomodated many diet \"restrictions\"/demands from a few other tables. He checked up on us at perfect increments to ensure we were comfortable, food were fine, and that we were well attended to and are having a great time. Mike even walked us out and opened the door for us when we were leaving - truly an unforgettable experience. 

Note: parking lot is very small and limited due to this is in a small plaza beside park/residential buildings. You can easily find free parkings on the streets behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is very nice, the Owner is very friendly.and the food is excellent taste, well presented.

I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I must say it took me 6 years to finally step into New Orleans Seafood and Steakhouse and I don't know why. Never expected a quality restaurant in a small almost unknown street. 

After reading other yelpers reviews I knew I had to try it. And from the moment I stepped in it felt like home. I forgot to ask their names but the customer service is top notch. They are friendly and happy. 

The food was over my expectations. I love spices and I was served with my seafood gumbo. The shrimps were a generous juicy size. The side bread was warm! 

Then my main dish Creole Seafood Pasta was a generous size. The taste was perfect. They are very generous yes again generous with the seafood. 

Very happy overall with my visit and will definitely go back more often. Just for the amazing staff it's worth it and the chef is amazing. 

It's a must, if you're on Scarlett rd between 5 and 9 (tue-sat) please go you will be satisfied. 

I didn't take dessert because I was already tooo full but the selections made me think twice."}
{"text":"In the area for business and trusted the Yelp reviews enough to try this place out! So glad I did!!!!"}
{"text":"What makes New Orleans different from other restaurants is the amazing service, that is always number one for me. I would rather eat at a mediocre restaurant but with fantastic service, than a place that has horrible service but great  food. It just ruins the whole experience. However, New Orleans is a triple threat: good food, good service, good ambiance. Our waitress was lovely, had a calm and pleasant demeanor, and was very attentive. 

We ordered the cajun mussels and the special of the day, which is what I would recommend. Since this place is known for seafood, I chose mahi mahi and my boyfriend picked the salmon. When the dish came it looked great, very simple but I think a lot of care and steps were taken to make the dish delicious. It was served with some roasted/grilled veggies, some rice, and about I'd say 6 oz of mahi mahi. I bit into it, and wow. So tasty and fresh. The texture was firm on the outside, but once you bit it, it was soft but not crumbly in an overcooked way. The cajun mussels were super fresh as well, because a lot of places that serve you mussels, they almost taste like they were frozen because they have that wrinkly/shrunken look and really chewy with a hard texture. But the mussels here had a bouncy exterior, but was semi soft to the bite. The sauce definitely had cajun seasoning and I really could have just drank  the whole thing from the bowl. It was that good.

The owner I think came to check on our table and also ran out the door to check with us again as we left the restaurant. We were both fast eaters and sort of just left quite quickly. I think that's how New Orleans gets returning customers (from what I've read from previous reviews), it is because they take the time to chat with you and connect with you.

I was so happy with my experience and food. Yes, it is steep, and yes I will fork out money for it again. You get what you pay for. I highly recommend visiting  this lovely little gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and me went for dinner today and we had a great meal. Crab cake and scallop appetizers (both specials) were tasty - scallop cooked perfect and the crab cake lump. My wife and I shared the jambalaya for dinner, it was very very good. I'm West Indian and I lived in Florida for 8 years; I have had my share of Creole food and this was very good. Definitely amongst the best Creole food I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Consistently Great Reviews are True

I had a terrific meal at the New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse where I had the catch of the day (sea bass). It was cooked perfectly and delicately seasoned (appropriately for sea bass). Fresh vegetables. Excellent meal for sure and worth going out of your way for. Don't let the location and frontage fool you. It's great. Mike, the owner/Matre'D was lovely."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing!
Funny story how we came across this place: We were looking for a late dinner and I was in the mood for some southern Creole food! Yelp directed us here and we arrived around 10. Turns out they close at 10! So we had to go somewhere else but we promised we would be back! The very next day in fact! Customer service here is no joke! They know how to treat the customers and are extremely friendly! Customer Service like this is hard to find these days

Our appetizers were Crab Cakes and Gumbo Yaya. My boyfriend said the crab cake was good and I did try a bite, which happened to be the first time ever having crab! My gumbo though was delicious! The type Meema makes you on a cold day to warm up your soul. This is exactly what it did! Warmed my soul up and it was the right amount of spice and flavour. Made my palette dance with every single bite! Beware though, it's a big portion for an appetizer.

Our mains were equally as good. My boyfriend had ordered the Sea Bass special and I went with the chicken. I was told the Sea bass was tender and my chicken was tender as well. All in all, good flavour however I could do more spice on the chicken. 

After we had asked for the bill, one of the gentlemen came up with a free shot of something that tasted exactly like junior mints. Yummy! My final verdict? You must come here! Don't be thrown off by the location because the food is epic. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The place was packed, but the staff were super accommodating. We had been directed here by great Yelp reviews, but were from out of town. They managed to swing us a table for three. I had the Seafood creole pasta, my wife had the Shrimp creole, and my daughter had the sea bass. We shared a scallop appetizer, and barely had room to share a single dessert.  The food was excellent (best seafood creole i've had), and the service and staff we amazing. We will go out of our way to make a return here. Highly recommended, but maybe make a reservation ;-)"}
{"text":"I chose this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, the staff are super friendly and very nice. We had very good time. We ordered Jambalaya because of many pictures posted and looks like it is a famous dish at this restaurant. I hoped the food tastes better and that's why I gave 4 stars. I might be fine with one time trying this place."}
{"text":"The sea bass is AMAZING, so is the steak, my boyfriend had. Really good! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place and was very pleased with the whole experience. 

We started off with some bread which was so good and a perfect start. We were both in the mood for steak so we ordered the Angus. It came with potatoes and vegetables which were roasted to perfection. The steak was absolutely amazing!!!

The service was the best part. The owner came out and spoke with us. Made us feel really welcomed. I am definitely coming back over and over again. 

Tips: Make reservations. It's a small place and fills up."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place! I was searching through the internet, looking for a nice spot to eat that wasn't downtown and wasn't a chain restaurant. I ended up looking on trip advisor and saw that it was #10 our of 6700 in Toronto, so I thought I might as well try it out! 
Don't let the area fool you either, it is a sketchy area but YOU HAVE to have the food here, it's amazing. The parking lot is very small, since it is in a tiny plaza there is minimal parking, but we got one and I'm sure if it was full we would have found one on the street (since this isn't downtown).
Anyways getting to the food.
They brought us some HOT bread which held us down until our appetizers came.
For an appetizer my bf and I shared the Cajun Calamari. They ended up splitting it up for us and we both had a nice presentation right in front of us. The calamari was so good and it came with a salad which was also delicious.
To the main course now. My BF had the blackened Chicken breast, and I had the seafood creole pasta! I didn't try his but it looked delicious and he said it was great. My pasta was so gooddd! Not your ordinary pasta. It had great flavours, they put a lot of seafood and fish in it, not like those big chain restaurants that say its a seafood pasta and you end up with 2 shrimp and a mussel. Its just so good you have to try it out. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came across this jewel of a restaurant on our way back to the airport from a business trip.  On their specials menu for the evening I had sea bass... melted in your mouth.  For apps, we had the calamari and coconut shrimp, all delightful.  Needless to say the food was terrific.  But what set this restaurant apart from the others is the charming owner, Mike.  We chatted with him throughout the evening and laughed like crazy.  So refreshing after 3 days of packed meetings from morning to night.

If I ever did come back to Toronto, I'll be sure to come back to this place.

Thank you Mike for spending time with us at our table!"}
{"text":"This place is easily one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The owners were so friendly and welcoming! The food was DELICIOUS! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with the boyfriend last night and I have to say first and foremost that it was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I read some reviews beforehand and made sure to make reservations since I had heard the restaurant is not very big. Please do this, as this is correct -- the restaurant is very busy and it would definitely be difficult to get a table if you were to drop-in.

As soon as we arrived we were greeted warmly and taken to our table. The servers were very attentive and the waitstaff chatted with all the patrons throughout the night -- it really showed that they cared about their customers. 

We decided on the Jambalaya for Two and had wine to keep us company in the meantime. The decor was very quaint and the ambiance of the restaurant was very warm and relaxing. Jazz-related decorations were everywhere on the walls (Billie Holiday paintings, saxophones) and the restaurant played Jazz all throughout the night.

The food arrived in exactly 30 minutes as promised. The amount of food was definitely enough for two people to eat and be very full at the end. The flavours were bold and the jambalaya was chock full of sausages and seadfood (mussels, crawfish, shrimp, and grouper) -- no skimping on the meat at all. It was very delicious and we will definitely be coming back in the future. Though it can be a bit on the pricey side, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing southern food that tastes extremely fresh and like perfect home cooking. 

I went on a Wednesday evening around 8 and it was about half full. I had made a reservation, so it was fine. The staff were extremely kindly and you could tell they actually cared about whether you were having a good time/meal. 

I had the gumbo and it was extremely. Possibly a little too spicy for my liking, but that completely a personal preference and I'm sure others love that amount of spice. I then had the shrimp dinner with rice. It was amazing and the shrimp were soaked in this perfect sauce. The vegetables were also great. 

I ended up staying a little late and a lot of the other guests had already left, but the manager (possibly owner) was nice enough to let us stay and told us to not feel pressured to leave. He was also kind enough to give us this desert liquor which was a very nice touch on his part. 

If the food itself doesn't win you over, (which it should) then the service definitely does. 

The atmosphere also really completed the whole setting.

The final bill was around $95 + tip for two glasses of wine, two apps and two dinners. Definitely worth it considering everything you get."}
{"text":"Excellent meal this evening at New Orleans Steak and Seafood. I've been meaning to come by here the past year after I heard rave reviews from some friends. This weekend I decided I would take my partner here for his birthday and we were not disappointed. I made a reservation for 6pm and when we arrived the small restaurant was pretty much full. We were seated by the window and had no less than three servers ask us what we wanted for drinks. This could be seen as disorganized but we found it charmingly overserviced. My partner had seafood gumbo to start and as I was having the fisherman's platter as my main course (which looked pretty generous), I simply enjoyed the warm bread while he happily tucked into his piping hot bowl of gumbo.  We both loved our meals. My platter was a delightful combination of coconut shrimp, cajun calamari, blackened fish, rice and grilled vegetables while my partner enjoyed a good sized portion of seafood penne pasta.  We had a few glasses of wine and skipped dessert because we were so full. The owner or manager of the restaurant was doing the rounds as people were finishing their meals and he brought us a lovely dessert drink in a shot glass on the house.  This exemplified the service we had all evening and was a perfect ending to a great cajun meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and even more amazing service. Jambalaya, crab cakes, and calamari was all excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"What a find! I heard about this place, and finally made it a point to reserve dinner here. Here are a few points...

1. The food is more seafood than steaks. I had a gumbo and a shrimp jambalaya that were delicious. I also shared a crab cake appetizer that was definitely better than most.

2. Service is excellent though it can be spread thin at times.

3. The vibe is both relaxed and anti-hipster. Everyone here was taking their time enjoying their meals and talking with friends an family. The restaurant seemed to welcome long family conversations and another glass of wine. No one is rushed here.

4. Thick carpet, upholstered chairs, a large artificial tree, and paintings of jazz musicians fill the space. It is tasteful, but by no means cool!

5. They have amazing food, great wines, and excellent service. If you are looking to have a nice meal in a more low key spot, this is it."}
{"text":"The food and service here are second to none! The host and owner is so friendly!
The food is excellent with most of it being seafood cooked creole and cajun style.
It's not a huge place but there is plenty of seating and busy even on a weeknight because it is so good."}
{"text":"Well that was fantastic.  The appetizers were fantastic.  They have a beer coconut shrimp cocktail with marmalade sauce that was out of this world.  The service is amazing.  And the place filled up quickly.  I discovered this gem by looking up jambalaya on Yelp, and did they ever deliver.  The jambalaya was just packed with exceptional seafood, cooked perfectly.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We went here for an anniversary dinner and loved it! We have passed this place many times driving and only popped in because of the stellar reviews. Well we are definitly coming back. It's cozy and quaint with jazz music art on the wall. The owner was super nice! He came out a couple times to check on us and gave us his famous shot on the house at the end of the meal. It was delicious. He walked us out with a big smile and made us feel like family! We were raving about that all the way home, that we don't remember the last time we had that kind of customer service in Toronto! The food was awesome and we loved the peppercorn sauce on our steak. We can't wait to come back for our next date night! :)"}

Inauthentic Caesar salad. Bland Jambalaya, not Beau Bridge . Generic wine list. Worst pecan pie I've ever had : bland . Great ethnic crowd.Friendly service. No bone in steaks on menu"}
{"text":"What else can I say about this wonderful place. The service was fantastic, the food was fresh, flavorful, authentic and simply amazing. Our group of 4 came in here really unplanned as we happened to be in the area. I love the fact that it is a small place but felt very cozy and inviting. The decor was very well put together and really felt like you're in a local New Orleans restaurant.
We ordered cajun calamari, coconut beer shrimp and mussels for appetizers and for the main course the fresh fish of the day (3) and Fisherman's plate (1), All were excellent choices! 
The owner Mike was so friendly, he spent a lot of time talking to us and just having a great conversation. In fact, we were having such a good time, we were the last customers by the time we left. Mike even gave us some shots (i forgot what they were but it was good) and also some parting gifts with their special seasoning! Thanks Mike! We will surely come back on our next business trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the steaks, as none in our party ordered one.  But the seafood was great and authentically New Orleans in style.  A special of crab cakes was wonderful and came with a little salad cleverly presented in a cucumber slice wrap.  The cakes themselves were spicy and delicious and were served in a good remoulade sauce.  Saefood gumbo was great and had just the right flavour, as did the entree of shrimp creole.  A seafood pasta was properly al dente and loaded with goodies.  Bananas foster was a good dessert but was not flambe'd at the table.

Intimate atmosphere but crowded - it is a small room so make reservations.  Very considerate service and the owner is always present and solicitous."}
{"text":"Very cozy and intimate atmosphere. Service was superb, very personal, timely and extremely pleasant. The food though is on a different level. There was 6 of us and I tried a little of everyone's dishes. I got the fresh fish of the day which was sea bass and pretty much melted in my mouth! I also tried the fisherman's plate (amazing), the vegetable creole pasta (vegan friendly and good), chicken creole pasta (also good), shrimp creole (awesome), black angus steak (med rare and delicious). We also shared crab cakes, monticello salad and seafood gumbo (great kick to it). All of the appetizers were all absolutely amazing. Every single plate, appetizers and mains were practically licked clean! I can not wait to go back here. I am salivating just writing this review! Highly recommended mainly for the food but also for the wonderful atmosphere and very personable owner who makes the experience very special. Can't say much to deserts as everyone except for the 12 year old at the table was just so perfectly full and didn't want to top it off with desert.

Not to mention that I actually accidentally made the reservation for after they usually close and they didn't even mention it and were still very happy to serve us. I eat late often but in the suburbs and it's extremely rare that places will stay open just for us. It's always a pleasant surprise when they do!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem is a good way to describe this place. If I was driving by I would not stop based on the plaza it is in. It looks very small and it is but well worth a visit. I found Yelp reviews and decided to try it. 
We were not disappointed. The bread was excellent; warm and delicious. My fiance had seafood gumbo which was very good. The Caesar salad did not have bacon or croutons but the homemade dressing is excellent and delicious. A generous portion of lovely cheese compliments it very well. We both thought it was superb. The portions are not huge but not too small either. The Seafood Creole Pasta was very good as was the New Orleans Fisherman's plate. The blackened fish was perfect; not too salty with the right amount of blackening flavor. 
We were surprised that the Bloody Caesar did not have pepper on the rim: only salt, especially when my fiance requested a thick rim. This is the only reason I am giving only 4 stars instead of 5. I would like to give it 4.85.  When we questioned it we were told that is the way they make it so we sent it back. We were surprised that a Cajun restaurant did not make the rim with a lot of spice as we would have preferred. They did not object and asked if we would like something else.  
The restaurant is not very big so it is not a place for intimate conversations.  The associates are  very friendly and attentive.  The owner is a very sweet man who makes you feel like your opinion matters very much.  He aims to please and we would definitely return.  I really like Cajun food and the food here is excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is delicious, we had the jambalaya for 2 and it was soooo good! Great atmosphere, amazing service!! It was our first time, we'll definitively come back!! Thank you so much..."}
{"text":"Perfect night for as stroll to this seafood restaurant #3 best seafood in the city by TripAdvisor. Loved the Fisherman's platter. Great decor and noise level and space. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Everything everyone says is 100% true...just come
Try this place already and be prepared to have your minds blown clear off your shoulders"}
{"text":"It was simply an amazing and cozy restaurant with great service. The food is incredible. The best crab cake I have ever had and the Jambalaya is just very delicious. Thank you"}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant. The food is always amazing and the ambiance as Daria mentioned below is wonderful. 
I had the beef tenderloin and it was one of the best meals I can remember having in a long time. The beef practically melted in my mouth. I also had the crab cakes appetizer and usually I'm not one for crab cakes because they taste too fishy but these ones were so flavourful and you could tell everything was made fresh. 
They aren't afraid of putting shrimp in your shrimp pasta, and the vegetables are all cooked to perfection. The owner, Michael, is very attentive and makes you feel like you're welcome and appreciated. It almost makes me sad that more people don't know about this awesome eatery!"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood and jambalaya,  and the price is very reasonable. This is our 2nd time and will be coming again."}
{"text":"- ordered the jambalaya extra spicy; it was great, large portion & super flavourful 
- owner was very warm & welcoming
- would definitely go here again"}
{"text":"I found this New Orleans restaurant while searching on Yelp a few weeks ago . So for valentines I booked a hotel in Toronto to do some cultural events and entertainment . I booked reservations 2 weeks ago as I saw that this restaurant books up quickly . I soon learned that it was in the top 10 restaurants in Toronto . 
My wife and I loved it ! Food and service are top notch ! 
I highly recommend it . We will certainly come here again in the future ."}
{"text":"Best crab cakes ever!!! The specials here are always fantastic, but I also love the shrimp creole. The staff is fantastic and always friendly."}
{"text":"The absolutely best Jambalaya anywhere!!!!!   

It is totally true, and if you don't believe me, try it for yourself and you will be writing the same great review. 

We have been coming here for too many years to rent and it is constantly great amazing and friendly service all them time. 

The Jambalaya is so nice with real creole seasoning and served hot fresh out of the oven (30 minutes to prepare) with the craw fish and mussels on top. It looks so appealing and a work of art you almost don't want to eat it. 

Now is said almost because once you take the first bite you can't stop eating it until you are finished. 

I asked the owner how to get some creole sauce or spice and he said they actually just put a sauce on Sobeys shelves called Creorleans sauce. I can't wait to go and buy one to make my own and also he said try it on pizza as you sauce. 

I can't say enough about this place other than Go angle try it!!!"}
{"text":"I can't seem to understand how I pass by this place every day on my commute, and only today decide to eat here. 

The interior of the restaurant is unexpectedly gorgeous. Jazz music played as we entered- it was great. We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately. 

I ordered the salmon special and my guy got the seafood pasta. Our waitress was sweet and friendly. Fresh bread was delivered soon after. The bread was warm and wonderfully crispy! But it was served with margarine. That was disappointing.

The food arrived shortly. The salmon was served with rice and beautiful roasted vegetables. The salmon was cooked perfectly inside, and was blackened the way I love it. My guy's pasta was enjoyed as well, and it was a memorable meal for the both of us. We also ordered a creme caramel, and it was delicious! 

We had a great intimate evening at this restaurant. I would love to come back some time. Definitely would recommend New Orleans Seafood and Steakhouse for a romantic dinner or an intimate gathering with close family and friends."}
{"text":"A cozy little restaurant in our neighborhood. Service was great and friendly. Atmosphere was romantic and casual. Slightly over priced, and some of the dishes need a kick. Overall food was tasty and we will return!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  In the middle of nowhere, I have no idea what motivated us to drive 35 minutes from downtown to check this out (OK it was my birthday, but still...) and are we ever glad we did.

Set in a small strip mall this family-run southern cooking star is worth the drive! The wonderful couple who own and run this have been at it for over two decades - and it still nails a menu designed to impress and satiate your palate.

Their Jambalaya star was tempting but we wound up splitting scallop and handmade crab cakes for appetizers.  The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the crab cakes had a delightfully crispy exterior with a hot buttery crab filling.  Incredible.

I ordered the Fisherman's Platter and the lightly cajun coated grouper was stunning.  A perfect balance of texture, spice, and flavour.

My partner had the tenderloin which served with a well-balanced light tarragon sauce simply melted in your mouth. 

The young waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  She was backed by our host who demanded we stay for a complimentary birthday pecan pie and creme carmel!  Who says no to awesome homemade desserts! 

I'm a fussy reviewer and have to say, these folks nailed it all around!  Thank you, we will be back to try the rest of the menu and experience your warm hospitality!"}
{"text":"New Orleans was a great place to have a birthday dinner. The service was very attentive, and the owner seemed to genuinely care about the customers, welcoming everyone and saying bye to everyone. The crab cakes special was delicious - very soft and moist. The coconut shrimp was also delicious. We had the Jambalaya for 2 and it was so amazing. The fish in it was beautifully done, well seasoned, and not at all dry. Expect to take a little bit of the Jambalaya for 2 home with you, but good news, it's just as good the second day!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. We'd driven but this place for years and never thought about going in. We finally went on a friend's recommendation and we're so glad we did. The crab cakes were spectacular. We went with the jambalaya for two was out of this world. The crawfish were a miss. It the jambalaya itself more than made up for it. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"An excellent meal. The Jumbalaya was delicious, served in the cast iron pan it was baked in. Stuffed with seafood and chicken, fish and sausage, the dish's complex flavours were a real treat. Starter of crab cakes was shared and each plate had tasty salad. Dessert was warm pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. We truly enjoyed ourselves.  Definitely on our list of must return to restaurants."}
{"text":"Do not judge this book by the cover!

Great ambiance, great service and great food.
Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
Make sure you speak to the owner ..it's very entertaining to hear how the place came to be and without a doubt he will bring you on of his signature \"desserts\""}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday with my brother.
Upon getting there, we thought \"we don't wanna go in there\", but we got out of the car anyway.
As we grabbed the door, we saw the restaurant full. I immediately thought \"it must be good food\".
And I was right! We just discovered a hidden gem. Could have never imagined this place to be so nice.

Such personalized attention! The owner runs the floor while the wife cooks. The owner kept checking on us. Gave us dessert on the house and came out almost to our car to see us off.

Not to mention, the entrees were amazing.
This is an absolute 5-star restaurant
A nice, cozy little place.
A must try"}
