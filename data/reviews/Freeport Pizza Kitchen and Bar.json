{"text":"Pizza not good, the food is expensive.  Over $5 for 4 regular cheese sticks with dipping sauce that tasted like it came out of a can.  The pizza which they claim is from a old recipe was bland, the sauce again not good, there was hardly any cheese and the crust had a slight garlic taste but it was not very tasty.  The worst is they charge $2 for kids drinks, that totalled $6 in itself.  Not cool.  The service is slow even though they were pretty much empty and it took forever to get a pop refill. I will not go back and if you want good pizza look elsewhere.  I went one time before this and the service was slow then but the fried cheese was half mooned shaped and tasted better, the menu still says they are half mooned shaped but it lied."}
{"text":"Started strong, but it seems to be getting worse. Been there several times, and now I find inattentive staff (sat us in spilled beer!), dirty tables and undercooked pizza. And the two \"owners\" need to actually DO something, not just walk around & talk to guests.  The sad thing is that I really want to like this place, but they are making it increasingly difficult as it is gaining speed on it's way downhill."}
{"text":"They are no longer open. I had a gift certificate for that place too! How do I get my money back now? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I was given a gift card by the manager as an enticement to try this place again, after I wrote a somewhat negative review based on a prior visit.  Kudos to the manager for leveraging social media to connect with customers.  The place was crowded on a Friday evening, which I took to be a good sign.  We were seated promptly.  I overheard the family seated next to us saying how much they liked the pizza.  I took that to be another good sign that maybe they had made some improvements.  Our waitress was helpful and attentive considering how busy the place was.  So I would say service has improved.  As for the food, it was somewhere between ok and good.  The chicken/chili nachos was large enough to feed four hungry people and came with a special sauce (sorry I can't remember the name) that was very good and something I had never had before.  When the manager sent me he gift card, he suggested we try the buffalo chicken pizza - a thin crust, cheese (cheddar?) pizza with chicken, and a sauce made from a blend of buffalo sauce and ranch dressing.  It was a little dry, and somewhat light on the sauce, but better than I expected..  So, I can increase my rating to 3-stars and honestly felt an improvement compared to my previous visit.  I hope they stay the course."}
