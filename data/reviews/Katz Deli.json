{"text":"Can't say that this was my favorite deli....The place itself was clean and sanitary and the staff were friendly and attentive but the food didn't really impress. My parents had the open-faced Reuben sandwich while I had a turkey sandwich. My dad said he liked it but my mom..... not so much. I tried some and thought that the amount of sauerkraut/cheese to meat ratio was very off. There was SO much sauerkraut and cheese that you didn't even see the bread! We're not big fans of sauerkraut either so it wasn't a joy to have in the sandwich. As for my turkey sandwich, it was like I had made it myself! Nothing to write home about.....The potato salad was very delicious but you only got a tiny cup of it! The prices were outrageous as well! I don't think that my family and I would come back."}
{"text":"Excellent!  My first open faced Reuben was amazing! Matzo ball soup was perfect. Outstanding food and service.  Owner came and spoke with us! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey BLT and it was absolutely amazing. My only complaint about the sandwich was that there was way too much turkey put on. It took away from the other flavors that was on the sandwich. As a sandwich should always be, it was served with a pickle. I did not like it. It had not been sitting in the brine for long enough and still tasted like a raw cucumber. I also did not like that the drinks were served in a can so I was not able to get a refill. The brownie I got for dessert was amazing and tasted like one that grandma would make. Service was great and the food came out in no time at all. I would definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know what took us so long to try Katz but my family has now declared it our \"weekend restaurant\"   went for lunch today, my boys all enjoyed their lunches and my open faced Reuben was the best I've had. My husband ordered a Taylor ham, egg and cheese and it was just like being back in NJ! Katz deli makes this Jersey Girl transplant happy!!!"}
{"text":"I was told by the owner that they have the best Reuben in charlotte. He was right!!!!! Wow. But get the half size, no human being can finish the whole unless you are starved. It's so yummy taking my coworkers back today."}
{"text":"had a loaded pastrami sandwich potato pancakes & drink as a treat. Superby prepared and taste!"}
{"text":"So delicious! We've eaten here several times, and have never been let down. Food always tastes so fresh. The employees are also amazing! Always friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Best turkey Ruben in the soutth! Massive sandwiches and incredible customer service. Family owned!"}
{"text":"I'll pay a few extra dollars anytime to go here! HUGE Ruebens, great BLT & amazing soup!!! A+ all the way!!"}
{"text":"Great deli in South Charlotte. We had a Reuben, corn beef sandwich and a turkey BLT. Loved it. Great food, selection and staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A little ways off the Stonecrest stretch lies the Camfield Corners shopping center. Given that this strip mall isn't as traveled, I was surprised to find such a well regarded Deli next to Bi-Lo. With little knowledge about the best around here, I decided to give Katz a go for lunch.  First thoughts of the restaurant was a rendition of a classic NY-Style Deli. Not much in the decor but clean and straightforward. They have a big case with deli meats and salads (the starchy one's like potato, pasta, tuna, etc) and a huge menu full of all kinds of sandwiches, burgers, and catering options.  I'm a simple guy: I see \"Charlotte's Best Reuben\" on the menu, I order the Reuben. Food came out quickly with a side of Potato Salad and the open-faced sandwich was HUGE. I cut the thing in half only to be slightly disappointed. For $13, I expected a lot more corned beef than what I got. The meat was topped with the sauerkraut and cheese as if to almost conceal the meat, the sandwich was more 40% kraut, 40% cheese, 20% meat.  Everything about the sandwich on it's own was good. Fresh kraut, quality beef, nice rye bread, and soft, mellow cheese. It just seemed like proportionally it was off and the value really wasn't there. I would argue that the \"Charlotte's Best\" title wasn't well defended today.  If I'm ever back in the neighborhood, I'd give something else a try. It appears that everything is a bit on the pricier side, the lady in front of me paid 8 DOLLARS for one slice of cheesecake (granted it was a very large slice, but still!). They keep a lot of typically unseen items on the menu like chopped liver and whitefish so I would come back for something new."}
{"text":"We were so excited when we heard Katz was reopening. The food is absolutely excellent. From the corned beef, pastrami, pickles, potato salad. You can't go wrong. The owner is very friendly and the quality of food is unparalleled. We took a slice of cheesecake to go and took one bite as soon as we fit the door and before we knew it- every bite gone! Next time we go back we will try the breakfast. The lox looked so tasty in the deli case. Make the trip to Katz. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"After 12 years of being hidden away in an office park across from the Arboretum off Providence Rd, this popular little NY-style deli has relocated to Camfield Corners off Elm Ln (beside Bi-Lo). Fortunately, the location is the only thing that's changed, as the same passionate owner still mans the grill, serving up the same top-notch chow from the $3.95 (until 9 AM) breakfast to their popular open-faced Reuben.  Our group of three was there at 9:30 on a Friday morning after the breakfast rush. We all ordered breakfast and each were perfectly prepared, hot and delicious. The owner/cook introduced himself and thanked us for coming. The sanitation score was high and customer service offered by the one other employee was also friendly and attentive.  My only complaints were all minor items such as margarine being offered in lieu of butter, just so-so coffee, half-and-half carton stored in self-serve community fridge where other self-serve beverages are displayed and plain, lackluster atmosphere. Yet again, they got the main things right.  Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I have and appreciation for owner occupied businesses and I will definitely return to this one, next time for lunch."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and the food is  Wonderful!  My husband is from NJ so this was like a trip back to NJ/NYC for him.   I had a Philly  cheesesteak & my husband had corned beef- both were awesome!!  If you go do yourself a favor & get a slice of the cheesecake - it is AMAZING!!!!   We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Go to lunch spot for a sandwich in the area. Cheesesteak is fantastic!"}
{"text":"The first and only time I will eat here. While this gives the impression of the NY Deli, the taste is bland, it is overpriced and the staff is a tad on the ride side.   I ordered a hot corned beef sandwich on toasted rye, with coleslaw and thousand island. What did I get, a cold corned beef on rye with mustard and cole slaw on the side. It had no flavor.  No thanks, next time I will go to McCalisters. They get my order right, it tastes better and is nearly five dollars cheaper.   Oh and I was at the counter waiting and asked to move several tomes by the women serving the tables so she could reach plastic ware. Hey maybe do that from the other side or at least walk around the customer to get it from two feet away."}
{"text":"I wish I had discovered Katz deli sooner! The tuna salad sandwich is the best one I've have in charlotte since I moved from New Jersey 15 years ago. The employees are great and very helpful. Lee the owner is very welcoming and nice. I'm so happy to have found this gem"}
{"text":"Pricey but super tasty! The American Hero was delicious.  It is a hidden gem next to a BiLo."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. People who complain about pricing obviously have never eaten at a New York deli before. You pay for what you get. There are 3 size options for the sandwiches. People who bash the service don't understand the restaurant is new and still learning. Great rueben and awesome fries. Come in and try it for yourself before listening to some random stranger on Yelp."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this restaurant n Yelp, and so happy we visited. The sandwiches are amazing. I couldn't decide between pastrami or corned beef, so they offered to make a combo sandwich. We bought some of their homemade egg salad to take home and it was delicious. Yes, the sandwiches are a little pricey for Charlotte, yet much less than NYC prices. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Been here once and it was fantastic.  Had the open faced Reuben sandwich and it almost makes me want to move to NYC (just kidding).  Seriously this food is great, a little pricey but hey we're in the South and you're going to pay for a specialized menu that isn't everywhere in town (where every other restaurant evidently has the \"best\" BBQ in town).  The atmosphere is boring and there aren't many seats but I will be back for lunch next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome Deli. I've been there three times within the first week and a half of my first visit. Pastrami sandwich melts in your mouth. In fact, that's what I've had all three visits so far.   The staff is so friendly and helpful. If you're not familiar with all of the meats, they'll help you out.  When I want a sandwich, this is the place. Go!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich, great service, friendly atmosphere and very clean. The lunch menu looked excellent, I look forward to going back and trying lunch. Their deli rye bread was excellent."}
