{"text":"Have gone to one in Stallings a few times and had an awesome buffalo chicken sandwich, huge piece of chicken.  Ate at the Fort Mill one recently and they served 3 chicken tenders on their sandwich.  Horrible...very little blue cheese.  Seemed like they're cutting corners."}
{"text":"Great little bar in Fort Mill. We went for lunch and the beer was cold and the pierogies were fabulous."}
{"text":"I love this place, it just feels right. Excellent food, reasonable prices and a whole bunch of character!"}
{"text":"My husband and I happened to drive by BIG FOOD Small Bar and the name intrigued us. We were greeted by Tara (bartender) and Sadat (chef/manager) and we grabbed a table inside to watch football. There is a patio outside which looks charming but we wanted A/C and TV, which we had in abundance. Tara provided a vodka soda for me and an OMB Copper for my Hubby. The menu features appetizers, salads and sammies (yes, that was on the menu) with dessert nachos, which looked interesting. We ordered Crispy Sqeeks, fried cheese curds served with S.M.A.L.L. Sauce. (a slightly sweet mayo-based sauce with a touch of horseradish) sprinkled with chopped green onions. Sooo yummy!! The picture shows half an order because we gobbled before I took a pic.Soft, fresh mozzarella cheese in a light, crispy batter. Fried then drizzled with the sauce. I'm looking forward to checking out more delicious dishes on their menu!"}
{"text":"Big sign out front says \"bar and food\" but there is no food according to the bartender who was sitting outside. We called ahead and were obviously disappointed when we arrived."}
{"text":"Small Bar is great!  Super cold beer and the prices are the cheapest I've found in the area!  They play great tunes and the staff is awesome. Mark was beyond nice!  I had the hotdog...which doesn't sound like it would be exciting.  BUT IT WAS!  Bacon wrapped on a fresh bun like you'd get with a Lobster Roll.  This place ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"First time great food and service will be going back had the hot dogs more food than 1 person can eat"}
{"text":"It's a bar. It's small. It's Small Bar! It's cousin is right out front: Huge Patio!  Sound like my review for the location at the A.X. Music Factory? Yep. It's pretty close. This time they offer BIG FOOD! the \"first reviewer\" commented the menu looks like standard bar food... He never gave it a chance. Yes, it might appear as \"standard bar food\" but it certainly tastes nothing like \"standard bar food!\" I agree with his confusion on $6 snack mix, as I feel so does the owner.. and the last time visiting he took care of my friends when they asked for some the snack mix... Although, it is very tasty! So just ask, maybe they'll work with you if you're there ordering drinks.  Mark - the main guy you've probably always seen slignin' drinks at the aforementioned location is the owner and he can be seen here as well! Very nice guy to chat with.  I've never had an issue with the service as was mentioned in the first review. The second time in Kendra was awesome, attentive and really took care of us! It is not a fancy place at all, so don't be afraid to get up, walk around and ask questions. Don't expect to be waited on hand and foot like a fancy place. I'm not sure how the previous restaurant was - but I'm sure it was nothing like the current.  No, they don't have a drink menu. If you're not at the bar - stand up and walk towards the bar and see what options they offer! Be advised - they do not have draft beer. The Small Bar concept consists of poison that comes in can or bottle form and of course your common hard liquor poison. Every day they have different Happy Hour specials from 4-8pm! Very affordable! They also have some prices that are \"All Day, Every Day!\" .. like $3 Fireball and $1.50 Rolling Rock 12oz cans.  Stop by and check 'em out! The word(s) of the day is Small Bar Fort Mill... Spread the Word(s)!"}
{"text":"Great small neighborhood bar. Cheap drinks, great bar service, live music on the weekends, all around excellent dive bar vibe. Great place to bring friends, or just sit at the bar after work for a drink."}
