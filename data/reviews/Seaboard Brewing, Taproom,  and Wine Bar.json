{"text":"Great place. Friendly staff and good selection of beers and wines. Welcome addition to downtown Matthews."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  20+ beers on tap.  Great choices of wine by the glass and a wall of wine at better prices than I have seen at HT or Total wine.   They will even cork and pour for only $5.  Service was amazing and attentive and the charcuterie was great.  Definitely a new regular stop!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new business by the owners of the Carolina Beer Temple.  We are frequent patrons of the Temple which has a great \"feel\" when you walk in.  The staff always calls you by your name, the tap selection is great include 4 Belgians and the bottle selection does not disappoint. 

Last night was a pre-, pre-soft opening.  Now, I may be a bit biased but this place is going to be very popular.  Excellent location and parking.  The interior is a bit unique in a good way.  Half way to the back of the building is a courtyard/breezeway with outdoor seating.  This is not your typical craft beer bar in a warehouse theme.  The tap list is on two flatscreen tv's which is a first as far as I know.  

With a cigar store and soon to be growler store next door, coffee house and BBQ across the street, what else could one ask for?  We have spent years traveling around Charlotte to visit all of the breweries.  Now we may never leave Matthews."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our second visit. Staff is great..  atmosphere conducive for enjoyment... Can't  wait  until good weather to sit outside. Pizza fills the bill After a bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Seaboard for a good glass of wine in a friendly environment. I never feel weird or judged at this location, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. The one down side is they don't have a lot of food options. They have a cheese plate and a snack bar, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere in Matthews. Upscale yet not pretentious. Intriguing food list. Abundant wine list. Sufficient craft beer list. Good peeps. Great vibes."}
{"text":"Great too see downtown Matthews restaurant/bar options continue to grow. Great service! Beer and wine selection is phenomenal! Nice outdoor patio and various indoor seating areas. Now if only the Matthews cops would stop harassing all the bar patrons I would go more often."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for hanging out and having a beer with friends. The bartenders are friendly and there is a good selection of craft brews, including their own IPA and stout."}
{"text":"We went to seaboards to have a beer with 2 other couples.  The place was crowded inside so we we
To sit outside.  It had been raining so we asked if they could wipe us off a table and move a heat lamp closer to our table.  They proceeded to hand us towels to wipe the tables down ourselves and told us to also move the heat lamps.  After we moved the heat lamp we were yelled at by one of the employees who move the lamp back to the originally place offering no help at all. Terrible customer service experience.  Which is unfortunate because we are regulars there."}
{"text":"The first brewery in Matthews! With wine,  beer, pizza, charcuterie and more, what's not to love?  I come here for the great beer and staff.   One of many gems in the beermuda triangle!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go in Matthews. The ambiance is great and there is plenty of seating. They have a pretty good beer selection and the bartenders are prompt and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We are done coming here. This used to be one of our favorite spots and we have tried coming the last 3 Saturday's and they reserve the entire inside, leaving no seats. Bad move Seaboard.  Losing all of your supportive locals, hope the private parties pay well. Good thing competition is opening up all over the place."}
{"text":"Decided to try but don't plan to be back.  Me and a friend went in on a Monday around 4pm and it was empty - yet it took 15 minutes to be greeted.  Good thing we ordered our beers and pretzels then because they never came back to check on us.  Got the bill at the front counter and left."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, specials, wine and charcuterie! Love this place for date night or friends get together"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a wide selection of beers. Seaboard seems to focus on international beers, but we prefer american craft beers. We usually can find something that we like there. However, food is very limited so go there for drinks if your not expecting a large meal."}
{"text":"Great bar with future brewery! Slightly pricey. Nice environment. Great place to meet friends and hang out!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this new establishment the guys from the Beer Temple put together. It's a bummer I don't live closer. I'm sure this will soon become another staple for craft enthusiasts. And as Beer Temple is right across the street, now you can get both the bottle shop and larger taproom within walking distance of each other.

They have a fairly diverse selection with 24 beers on tap at a time. Prices are modest. 

They have some light snack food for only $1 a cup- Chex mix, peanut butter pretzels, Cheetos, etc.

The seating is more than adequate both inside and outside. When you don't get your spot at the Beer Temple, you can head out here. The additional space outside will be perfect with the cooler weather coming up. 

Great atmosphere and staff. Generally a great hangout spot overall- a must try!"}
{"text":"Such a cool little spot in Matthews!  Stopped in last weekend with some friends and tried some wines and a few beers.  Got a banana bread beer split half and half with a chocolate stout-so delicious!  Cute indoor space with high tops tables and big outdoor patio space.  Will def return!"}
{"text":"So happy we have something cool in Matthews. We frequent this place every couple weeks and love it. Great wine selection, beer is fantastic, the pizza place blows the peel across the way- away...and always nice people working. I bring people to try it and they love it too. Thanks for opening!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of this place. I came on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the gorgeous February weather outside on the patio with a glass of wine, or two. The place has a great vibe with picnic table, iron tables and chairs, plenty of space for socializing and for bringing along your dogs. The inside is roomy and has live music on Wed evenings. The staff were very nice and accommodating. Public parking is free next door. Great people watching location in downtown Matthews. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fantastic wine selection. Staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. Great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"Seaboard has a nice setup. I was impressed with the great beer and wine selection. I'm looking forward to the opening of the on premises brewery coming soon."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Matthews! Great wines and a really cool beer list! Super friendly staff. Recommend Highly!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting concept! Pleasantly surprised. 
Friendly staff, nice atmosphere! Its pretty cool Matthews is brining in cool, trendy spots like this."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection! Wonderful staff! Impressive Wine Wall! Love all the different areas to hang out. Food and snack options are wonderful. The place always seems busy... as it should be. And now with their own beers on tap... too cool."}
{"text":"We so needed this place!  You know, a place you can walk to in warm weather, drink local beers, decent wine, eat tasty snacks, and if you get really hungry, order take out so you can continue drinking.  Welcome to Seaboard!  I love that there is outdoor and indoor seating.  This place is unpretentious, casual, almost unassuming from the outside.  When you step inside, lively energy but not overwhelmingly loud so you can actually hold a conversation.  I like that they offer 'scoops' of snacks for $1, like peanuts, Chex mix etc.  novel idea!  We met up with friends and stay a while and ended up ordering chinese takeout.  The restaurant forgot to give us cutlery... no problem!  Seaboard had plastic utensils on deck!  Convenient!  They do offer a small snack menu in house if you are not wanting to order out but seriously who doesn't like BYOF?!  My only question is why do they close so early?(11pm on a Saturday). Maybe a Matthews ordinance?  I hope that changes.

I'm so happy to have a place nearby to grab a drinks and stay a while!  Thanks Seaboard"}
{"text":"We went the other evening and our group enjoyed a bottle of wine and a couple of beers.  Great selection of both. Sitting outside was great until the area was overrun by little kids running around like it was their school playground.  I really like the concept of the beer selection combined with the wines, but until they figure out that they are an adult establishment, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Seaboard Taproom & Wine Bar is \"off the charts\" cool. Had some time to kill and it was recommended I try this place out and I am so glad I did. The Queen Charlotte Pimento Cheese and Chips is a MUST HAVE while enjoying beer or wine!!! I tried the Warsteiner Dunkel which is a rich dark amber and very full-flavored. I was surprised how smooth this beer was. I then went with the Saison Dupont...must say this was one of the BEST Saison's I have ever enjoyed!!! This place is fun, exciting, and the staff serving you is TOP KNOTCH!!!"}
{"text":"They reserved a table for us even though they don't technically do reservations. We are off to a good start with that one. The vibe is very welcoming and I enjoy that it's a bit of an older much classier crowd than some locations in downtown Matthews. The service was great. We were a bunch of moms out on the town and the wine kept coming. We really had a great time. Being that it's a colder time of the year we weren't able to try any outdoor activities, but one on my friends said she did and loved it. You can also bring your own little appetizers. I mean what?!?!? That's pretty awesome. The wine is priced well and they have a large selection."}
{"text":"Comfortably located in the heart of downtown Matthews, this little gem is an awesome hang out.  Quality drinks, knowledgeable staff and good eats."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beers. Great atmosphere. Became our favorite Taproom upon our first visit."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place, good beer and attentive service the atmosphere is pretty laid back, sometimes they got live music going.
Don't expect to have a meal here their menu is mostly appetizers or cheese boards.
A bit pricey but the alcohol level on most of their beers is pretty high so you really don't need to drink a lot"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time Friday night.  Seemed like a fun place to hang out but wasn't for me.  They had a large selection of beer but wasn't really my style.  I like American craft beers and that wasn't the style of beers they carried.  I found a Founders Sumatra that I liked but they were having a problem with that particular tap.
I might try it again since it's close by.  Worth a try.  They had plenty of seating inside and out."}
{"text":"What a jewel!  Great cider selection and beer selection. Lots of out door seating which is perfect.  Hopping with lots of singles, families and dogs. Bigger than you think. Adding it to one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"Such a fun spot in Matthews! With the addition of pizza at the Exchange, it really has everything you need. The beer is great, the games are fun, and it always has a fun crowd!"}
{"text":"Always a good time - we were there for a wine and cheese tasting. Very nicely done and the place was happening.

Casual outdoor tables too, food truck, tons of different beer, huge wine section too. Parking is on the street in the quaint and busy Matthews downtown area many restaurants around, home to the Chamber of Commerce, and multiple businesses."}
{"text":"What a gem for downtown Matthews! Cool historical building that was an architect firm in a past life was upfitted for a modern beer and wine bar. I love that the history of Matthews was incorporated with the name of Seaboard as well as the graphic design work and art work. The set up can be a little confusing when you first walk in though. The front door directly faces Trade St., so if you come in through the back, circle around to the front door to get a sense of the lay out. To the left are wine offerings by the glass or bottle as well as charcuteries and to the right are the beer selections. If you love a good patio (who doesn't?), there are several spots to chose from. The front area has great people watching of Trade St., there is a back patio for more privacy, and there is a side patio with lawn games. The service is the great service that you can come to expect from the Carolina Beer Temple crew, so it's also a great place to learn more about what types of beers or wines that you might enjoy. They do offer a run club, cornhole tournaments, and I think yoga may be offered in the future too."}
{"text":"Great place to have a glass of wine or beer and play some giant Jenga while enjoying the sights of downtown Matthews."}
{"text":"This is a really cool spot!  The building is HUGE!  They have a front patio, a side patio, and a back patio.  The back patio is my favorite.  It's surrounded with walls, but has an open ceiling and a little tree growing through the top.  It used to be an architectural  firm, so there are cute little quirks throughout the shop.

The service was fair, not 100% personable, but not bad. It was a weekday night and not too busy.  There were two servers at the time I went (about 5 PM).  They have a great selection of wine, in fact a whole wine wall where you can purchase a bottle for there or to go.  The beer selection is pretty vast as well.  There are snacks to choose from, which is always a plus. 

There are games to play on the side of the building, TVs, and an overall fun environment."}
{"text":"I'm a resident of Matthews and visited Seaboard with my husband several weeks after it had opened. Believe it's named after the Seaboard Air Line Railroad which ran through Matthews in the late 1800s. It's in a fantastic location and I think it's proving a hit with residents...it was already quite busy when we visited. Great location for parking, first of all. Parking in Matthews can be a challenge, but this was right next door to the public parking area that lines the railroad track. Owned by the Carolina Beer Temple owner, who seems to have a knack for success. Great wines available...some by the bottle. There is a great outdoor area that overlooks Trade Street and my husband and I drank our wine and people-watched. There is some food there (cheese plate, as I recall), but Seaboard also encourages patrons to bring in food from other locations to enjoy with their wine (Royal Cafe and Creperie and Thai Taste are right across the street...street has a pedestrian crosswalk right in front of Seaboard). There were outdoor games available (horseshoes, maybe?) and a LOT of kids there and infants. Parents let their children play in the courtyard (I think there is at least one courtyard, maybe two) and sipped wine. Very relaxing environment. If you prefer to watch sports, there is also a section on the right as you enter where there are large-screen TVs for sports fans. Indoor seating at tables is also available, if the weather is poor. Looking forward to my return and for the success of this new establishment."}
{"text":"What a fun place! The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. We love the huge outdoor space. And we appreciate that we aren't judged for bringing our child. In fact, they were so sweet to our daughter when we came in (thanks Milton!) It's great family hangout (while mom and dad relax with a much deserved glass of wine/beer). We will definitely be making this a regular place :)"}
{"text":"Just did a wine tasting with their \"wine guy\"
Kyle and it was fantastic. Every single wine he picked was excellent. Three of us did the tasting and we were all very impressed. 
Go on Tuesday nights for their wine tastings. I know we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We hit this place up for New Years and had a great time. Loved the vibe of the place, and my Pinot was outstanding thanks to some great advice from the staff. I will definitely be back, just a great place to enjoy a drink with my wife."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere with lot's of good beer that changes often. They had 25ish beers on tap last night. The beer menu gives you good details to help you make a decision. if you still can't make a decision the bartenders will give you a sample. I don't drink wine but there is a ton of choices as well. You can sit outside in the front or the back or even the side. My friend rented out the back area of the building for a bday party for his wife. Worked out perfect, they put out \"reserved\" signs on the tables. 

They have TV's so you can watch sports if you chose. There are some appetizers but no full size meals. Last night was soft pretzels, pimento cheese, humus and I think one other. I wish they had more choices in food but it will not stop me from going back. I walked across the street to Moe's bbq and grabbed take out. They don't mind if you bring food in and eat it there."}
{"text":"This definitely wasn't the place I had hoped for.

My husband and I came in when we were in the area. We love The Beer Temple and Temple Mojo, so we were excited to try out their new concept.

They did have a lot of beer options, but I wasn't really interested in the ones they had on tap. I much prefer the tap lists at their other facilities. 

We did have a beer here that did not taste right. My husband has worked at several breweries in the past, so he knows beer. We weren't certain if it had to do with the lines or if the beer was simply old.

Staff was kind, but they were slow to wait on us and we were sitting at the bar. It was almost like they were refusing to make eye contact with us and the place was not busy when we were there.

I'll stick to their other concepts."}
{"text":"A fun place to meet friends but beware of the lackadaisical wait staff and the expensive wine leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for wine or beer in Downtown Matthews! Great atmosphere and lots of space for larger groups. Very extensive selection of wine and tons of great craft beer on tap. A must visit."}
{"text":"Seaboard is such an awesome addition to the newly booming downtown Matthews. The craft beer community was incredibly lucky to get Carolina Beer Temple--but to add a fantastic wine selection to the mix was genius.

The location is great, directly in the heart of downtown, it sits next to the newly expanded public parking area making it a breeze to park and walk to your destination. 

When you first enter Seaboard the bar sits in the middle of the building--to your left you'll find all the beer taps and to your right the wine. Of course, you can order either from both sides, but it makes it kind of fun to have that split between the two. They have a huge selection of both beer and wine and the staff is incredibly knowledgeable and eager to help you find something you'll like. In addition to beer and wine you can order charcuterie plates at a great price making this what I deem the perfect girls-night location. 

They have a huge outside patio that wraps around almost the entire building with cornhole and giant jenga for those looking for an activity. The interior also has plenty of seating around the bar and a large space in the back that you can rent out for private parties. I attended a bridal shower in that space and it was perfect. 

Matthews is stepping out of the shadow of it's big sister, Charlotte--check out what it has to offer!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience  couple  weekends  ago. Amazing beer. Bought a huge pint mug for Oktoberfest!!!!"}
{"text":"New in the area and please I dare you to find me a better bang for your buck bar in the area. After a long day at work, few things beat either going by yourself or with coworkers to get a drink or two or three haha. Though they may not serve food, have a great snack selection and great restaurants around the area that deliver. Awesome bar tending staff and great management. If you haven't been going here, what have you been doing? Go!"}
{"text":"I just found out that Seaboard started brewing their own beer, which meant they landed on the \"visit all breweries\" list. I thought they had a pretty good selection of their own beers, and a good selection of other breweries beer as well. They still have some good snacks (Cheetos!), and a Charcuterie plate. Outside on the deck is a new pizza place, so you can order a pizza there and eat it either inside Seaboard or outside on the deck. Pretty solid place to spend some time."}
{"text":"This is another business affiliated with the Carolina Beer Temple. I was able to check it out while exploring the craft beer scene.

They have a large beer selection of mostly European varieties but they also have a few Amercian craft beers in the mix. They also have an extensive wine selection.

The place is trendy. There's plenty of seating. My problem here is with the staff. They were not overly friendly and it wasn't busy when I visited and many of the staff was just standing around. In the other CBT locations, the staff is more engaging. Also when I arrived and and said I usually don't like German style beers, the bartender told me that I probably wouldn't find anything here. I actually found a non-german beer here that was quite enjoyable but the rudeness of the bartender turned me off that I finished that beer and left.

For people who like trendy atmospheres, you'll probably enjoy this but for me, I'll stick with the other two CBT options in Matthews which are more my style."}
