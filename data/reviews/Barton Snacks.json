{"text":"Worst place ever. Mac and cheese was crusty and burnt from the bottom of the pot and contained almost no cheese whatsoever. Every time I've been there they take 20 mins to make a couple orders of tacos, and each time they screw up the order (even though there's no one else in the place). Perfect example of shitty, overpriced, cooler than school, and utterly tasteless hipster culture bunk."}
{"text":"I got a chance to drop by Barton Snacks, and am happy to say that this place is a solid 3 stars.  The storefront is a cozy 5*10ft rectangle with a selection of ... I want to say...6 flavours of ice cream and a handful of \"alternative\" snacks. You won't see any national brands here; the merchandise features Johnny Ryan soda, Chocosol chocolate, and brands of chips that I can't even remember.  Boyfriend and I walked away with two small ice creams, 2 scoops each, with a $7 dent in my wallet. While it was delicious, we lamented that we could have bought an entire tub of Haagen Dazs or Ben & Jerry's with that money.  Bottom line: cute and sweet and way beyond my budget."}
{"text":"Worst fried chicken I've ever had in my life. I think it takes more effort to make fried chicken dry on the inside and soggy on the outside!   So soggy that you can't even call it fried chicken! I've had better Swanson (TV) fried chicken dinners.   Don't know what the line is for but do yourself a favour avoid the fried chicken at all costs!"}
{"text":"Just had some pretty decent ground beef tacos here. They could definitely have been spicier but all the ingredients were really fresh and tasty. The guy behind the counter was Friendly and the food came up quick."}
{"text":"Beef brisket is awesome here! Staff is friendly, food is fresh, and not very expensive.   I paid about $8 for 2 tacos that they prepared on the spot and served with a smile.   On top of that it's open late which is awesome, and they make their own cookies for ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place we is the WORST place to get any late night food - waiting for our food - some girl comes charging out of the back screaming at a girl to leave .. For no reason. The lack of moral and customer service is unreal... This place is somewhere you do not want to relate to Canadian culture :., the owner needs to figure out what employees actually work for the venue and the employees that steal and loose money"}
{"text":"Fairly poor showing. Fish tacos and donair hotdog were tried late night (tacos had a soggy texture), donair hotdog was a hotdog with donair sauce. Took longer than seemed reasonable for the food and it is cash only. 1 hotdog+2 tacos was $16, so it is also too expensive."}
{"text":"This place a refreshing and welcome addition to late night eats on queen west. I'm biased though, being tired of the same old pizza/shawarma options. Pulled pork, beef brisket, and fish tacos are all stellar, and the fact that they use 2 tortillas to wrap each one earns them the fifth star. 2 fresh-made tacos for $7 is pretty unbeatable, and they play good music, so the wait isn't unbearable. Great place to try and mitigate a hangover, 'cause all that drinking on a Saturday night is hungry work, right?"}
{"text":"Nice yummy tacos. Interesting space. Service was a little slow. As far as value is concerned, I think it is ok.   Mostly suitable for takeout."}
{"text":"Pop tart ice cream sandwich?  WHAAA?!?!?  Ice cream options were great.  I had toasted marshmallow.  Sandwich menu read well, although I only had dessert.  My coworkers had the aforementioned sandwich and a rootbeer float.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I love Barton snacks . Two tacos for 8$ and I always get their secret menu desert \"stoners paradise\" open til 4 am and fresh ingredients. Kitchen staff is always working hard. Warning: if you don't eat the tacos right away you'll need a fork as the corn tortillas become soggy"}
{"text":"This place is pure awesomeness. Too bad they don't have proper seating.    Def coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Fun place, but the food is meh, the prices are too much for the meh you get and there are so many other, better options within a few doors. Even, dare I say it, Canadian House of Pizza and Garbage is a better overall value."}
{"text":"Stoners paradise!   This place will meet all your munchie needs. Ice cream, tacos, hot dogs and cookies w/chips and pretzles!  GET THE JERK PORK TACO. It's awesome. Owner Chris knows what he's doing and makes the jerk pork with his own seasoning, in a slow cooker. Apparently they are all the rage with the industry peeps in the area.   Also, this place is open till 4am daily... perfect for a late night snack or two.  THEY HAVE HOT DOGS. My fav on the menu is the White Trash dog.  Cheesewhiz, bacon and chips. All kinds of awesome. I'm trying it next time.  Chris also just started making fish tacos as well. Not fried, but nicely cooked white fish with a ginger-mango salsa that he also makes himself.   Tacos are 2 for $6.  GREAT deal.  Check this place out... it's a cute little place, with seating only by the window. You're not meant to sit here for hours, rather eat a dog or taco and leave with ice cream.  Love it. Chris is so nice, and I'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Open 3pm to 3am, I'm a fan.   I couldn't decide on a hot dog or taco, which seem to be there specialties. So I had both...  The Taco- Flavored with jerk pork and gluten free tortilla...this was a real deal Cali style Taco. Awesome!  The Dog- Nitrate free, 3grams of fat...this was no ordinary hot dog! I ordered the Chicago (pickles, tomato, mustard onion and I believe celery salt).  Other dogs on the menu included a veggie dog, cobb salad dog and white trash dog. Creative menu, small quaint place I urge you to check it out!"}
{"text":"The quick fusion snacks here can me summed up to one word-  AMAZING.   So I had the Milkshake, (Birthday Cake) and it tasted JUST like bday cake, it was smooth thick and rich....made me wanna  bring all the boys to the yard, and put ya name on it.  (urban pun)  Had the White Trash Dog- Ridiculously amazing......On a steamed bun, cheese whiz, bacon, crushed potato chips on a really flavourful Weiner. It sounds like a strange mix, but trust me, when you bite into it, you will be blown away.  The Mac N' Cheese, although for the size you get (very tiny container) it's a bit pricey (I think $4) Its worth it, and split with a friend it's a great accompaniment to your hot dog.  It's SUPER CHEESY and strings of cheese chase the fork as you pick up this green onion covered goodness. (I know, right? Random, but TOTALLY WORKS!)    Let's see......this place isn;t too far from the nightlife of Tdot, and they are open really late.....Has a random fusion menu, trendy vibe, and nice staff.   Great for a stoner snack, casual date, or drunken food stop after the club,   FORGET STREET MEAT, EAT HERE! Never will u catch me at a vendor again.    -Queen"}
{"text":"They had cookies with bacon on it, and for that, I got super excited. When I asked what cookies flavor was under the bacon he said peanut butter. Peanut butter? Really? Its such a prominent flavor, it'll totally drown out the bacon taste; rendering the bacon: useless.  I wouldn't eat bacon with peanut butter, but I would with maple.  So I'm gonna have to doc you 1 star for that. On the otherhand, your jerk pork tacos aren't bad.  They're a little too small for my lifestyle though. I know these are vegan times but I still want portions to be large."}
{"text":"Oh Barton Snacks how I love thee.   Your jerk chicken taco is perfect for me. The sun in the sky is nothing compared to you You are the light of my life Please be open everyday and every night"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I just spent $80 on food here!!!! I just got robbed!!! Well I used to love this place. I used to live at the Bohemian condos and would come here every other week. Back then there was a Asian girl that worked there and she made the food so good, she made me crave it all the times. The Black guy there made it better. That's what I remembered.  Well today I ordered 2 Big Macs, 2 jerk sandwiches, mac and cheese and a kale salad. It all came to 80$ with 3 pops.  The Big Mac was a different sandwich than the one I had before. This time the buns where different, the meat was so dense and overworked and overcooked. The lettuce wasn't even fresh.  The jerk sandwich wasn't even better. When made properly this sandwich was the shit. The bread was stale and not even toasted. Not enough coleslaw or jerk pork. The sandwich is usually filled with spice and flavour but the one we got was bland.  The mac and cheese was not good either. There was so much water in the container, you could pour out the water. I could of made a big batch myself and would of been better and for cheaper.  The kale salad I haven't ate yet. That's for tomorrow. I hope it's  as good as I remembered.  I love eating good and I don't mind paying the high price for eat. But when you pay that high a price and get something some kid slapped together. I feel I got robbed. I should of went to McDonald's and got a Big Mac. It would of been a lot cheaper for the same quality."}
{"text":"pretty tasty jerk tacos.  consider it the 'decent' bastard when located next door to it's heavier brother. very expensive -- so bring an extra few bucks to try."}
{"text":"I can't give them a more than a 3 star review as most of the time I'm there it's after 2am and have already had a few drinks in me.  Staff is as friendly as they can be at that time, dealing with stumbling and bumbling customers.  Jerk pork sandwich or macNcheese are the go-to for late night eats."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after going for dinner at the Drake Hotel, had some ice cream and saw that they had a full menu of soft tacos.  I vowed to come back, and surely enough I eventually dragged some friends out with me to try the tacos.  We shared a root beer float and the ice cream was even better than I remembered it the previous time.  I was hoping to be blown away by the tacos, but I was disappointed.  The soft tacos were double stacked so each taco had 2 shells and I think that the soft tacos were reheated in the microwave, or at least it had that soft floppy feel like it was.  The tacos were incredibly messy to eat and I flavours did not come together very well.  I recall the pulled meat in one taco was completely overcome by the coleslaw on top."}
{"text":"Fantastic late night snacks, and surprisingly REAL tacos. Had the jerk chicken and the churizo and both were equally delicious. Also the tater tots poutine was an interesting and welcoming spin on the original."}
{"text":"What's so special about this place? - it's open till 5am What so extra special about this place? - their salted burnt caramel homemade icecream"}
{"text":"Open until 4am, Barton Snacks has saved my life on more than one occasion.   Alas, they're not open for lunch, since I work around the corner, but their food is equally good during daylight as it is in the early morning.   The quinoa burger is particularly delicious, expertly cooked, and with their great slaw topping."}
{"text":"There are times when geographical, or weather/alcohol related circumstances lead you to a new late night eats haven. My recent trip to Barton can be attributed to one or more of these factors, and I have to say I'm thankful!  While people line up for an hour to eat subpar pizza or poutine, I had the pleasure of eating one of the best jerk meat sandwiches I have ever experienced. Sure it costs twice as much as TO classics including Mr. Jerk and Allwyn, but considering the time of night this is one heck of a deal.  From what I remember the sandwich packed a punch, had plenty of meat, fresh coco bun, and pretty delicious 'slaw. I will definitely be back for more.   Overall a top 5 late night eats experience in Toronto taking away the events proceeding and following the jerk sandwich!"}
{"text":"Amazing brisket tacos. I live across the street, and this is just the thing I need late at night when I am looking for something that isn't pizza or poutine."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Finally, a solid late-night eatery on Queen West! (And no, I'm never drunk enough to eat from Poutini's)  If you're unable to trek it to The Lakeview and Hawker Bar in your drunken debauchery, Barton Snacks is your place - they recently opened up after the Drake BBQ pop-up closed shop.  Their menu falls under 3 broad categories: gourmet hot dogs, tacos and 'others'. I had their (?) MEXICAN DOG, which was an all-beef dog generously topped with ketchup, mustard, sauerkraut and avocado puree. My DCs ordered their FISH TACOS (which seemed a bit malnourished) and their special of the night, BEEF BRISKET ON MAC 'N CHEESE (which was a huge portion and probably the highlight of the night). Most of the items were between $5 to $10, so it was pretty reasonable. Unfortunately, it's a pretty small space so you'll probably end up standing."}
{"text":"The jerk pulled pork sandwich is soooooooooooo gooooood omgggg"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and never dropped in. Recently, I was nearby and opted to pick something up here.   The menu had a lot of enticing options but I choose the Chilean beef hot dog for nostalgic-sake. It was delicious. I did not want it to end. The toppings with fresh and the hot dog itself was hot and good quality. I had to wait about 10 minutes because the order ahead of me was big. But it was worth the wait despite my hanger. I can't wait to try some tacos and their tater poutine. And ice cream sandwiches there look a amazing!"}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service *** Ambience ***  Good however the tacos have become pretty expensive.  I used to get a few but now it seems to be more than $5 per taco.  $15 for three tacos is a bit steep for takeout.    The tacos are decent and definitely worth trying.  I wouldn't put this in my top taco spots in Toronto."}
