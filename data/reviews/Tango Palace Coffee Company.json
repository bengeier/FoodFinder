{"text":"Whenever I go to Leslieville (I go often) I visit this welcoming little coffee shop.   The atmosphere is very cozy. You can easily stay there for hours. The service has always been so friendly, sunny smiles behind the counter. Lovely tea selection! Go for some cookies too. The best spots are by the windows as the chairs & tables are a bit small. The place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Always love this place. Great coffee, free wifi, and its the perfect time for its backyard patio!"}
{"text":"Ok so the truth about why this place gets such good reviews is simple, yet unmentioned...so let me state it for the record:  This place is good because it is not Starbucks/Second Cup/Tim Hortons.  That is the only reason this place gets good reviews, including mine."}
{"text":"I go there every weekend when I'm in town and I'm always happy! Great service and fantastic coffee....best latte EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place- and am always greeted with a smile and good vibes when I enter the place.   The Best: Their lox and cream cheese bagel- they actually use fresh and amazing cured salmon...and a generous helping of capers and tartar sauce.  The only thing I'd change: I love how many spot there to sit, and the general atmosphere, but I do find, weirdly, that the tables are a bit low for the chairs.  Weird complaint I know- but I'm the kind of person that likes to stay at coffee shops for hours reading, I can't quite settle in here- which I would if I could find that sweet spot. The best spots are by the window- but the tables in the middle of the space are a bit cramped and awkward. That's the only thing I'd change! Still one of my faves to drop in!"}
{"text":"For those that don't know about TP, here is the scoop: think consistently good.  It's not the absolute best place to get your coffee/tea/sweets in Queen E, but it's damn good and very cozy, with some pretty welcoming staff.  The bevvies tend to be on the pricier side, but I have yet to have one that wasn't good.  Not great - but always good.  Same for the sweet treats.  Again, not cheap (usually $3-6 for cookies, scones, bars, etc) but there's always a huge selection.  Was there last week and for $16 got 2 tea lattes, a cookie and a date square.  The best part about TP is the atmosphere.  It has a very intimate and comfy vibe, and usually is packed with people from all walks of life (and ages).  This is it's real draw.  Good tunes, and if you score one of the high-back chairs, it's easy to twiddle away hours on the free wifi, on a book or even just people watching.  Not stroller friendly at all, which is a huge draw back for the Leslieville 'hood, but it does have a clean washroom and a few chairs outside to nest in, weather permitting."}
{"text":"Relaxed place. Good coffee and baked goods. Small but nice patio out back too."}
{"text":"This place was open past 8pm on a Saturday night. Drove here to grab some coffee. I must say I haven't seen an espresso machine so artful. The barista was very fond of making his drinks top notch and it was definitely top notch. If you are ever in this neighbourhood. Its a must stop for some java and wifi."}
{"text":"Adorable. Some of the places around here can be a little pretentious about their coffee (get over yourself, its espresso) but I don't ever feel pressured here. Music isn't so loud that you can't chat with your friends and you can tune out and chill out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for dancing lessons, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a comfortable place to catch up with a friend over coffee or just to relax... Tango Palace is king.  Tango Palace should be re-named Pastry Palace for the rich assortment of delectable goodies available to accompany your caffeine fix.  My personal favorite is the Pea 'not' chocolate bar.   The coffee shop's main appeal is the comfortable atmosphere that makes you feel as if you are sitting in someone's living room - armchairs to sink in and artwork to admire... all that is missing is the fireplace.  Occasional Tarot readings are offered to determine your own fortune for those who are interested.     Lively characters and regulars come and go, seating indoors or outside in the back patio... this coffee palace offers everything you could imagine and much, much more.  Tango Palace is a definite treasure of Leslieville and is a coffee shop that will not easily give up its reign.  Long live Tango Palace!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, delish food menu and baked stuff, great team! Great place to chill, work, read, or enjoy a cup of coffee and a bite with friends. I bought one of their Hale Coffee - Costa Rica Tarrazu coffee bags and it was one of the best coffees I have brewed at home!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"cozy, fine, crowded... they should extend since they have a lot of costumers..."}
{"text":"Excellent Latte every time.  Literally, EVERY time.  And their biscotti...who knew biscotti was so good!  And so fresh.  No rock hard biscotti here. My fave...the one slathered in Belgian chocolate.  But they are all fresh, massive and delicious.  And the patio in the back is awesome.  Worth me walking eight blocks, bypassing three other coffee houses on the way, to get my caffeine fix at Tango Palace."}
{"text":"Major points for the flirty baristo!  I ordered a tea, which kept me warm on my cold walk to the next bar.  This place was a pleasant, friendly stop on a drunken bar crawl, and I know that's not really enough to warrant rating it so highly, but I came out with a brownie, too, and that made me happy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here. I love the interior brick and decor, as well as the comfy seats. The place gets pretty busy but if you can grab a spot you can easily spend a whole afternoon there."}
{"text":"I love love love this coffee shop and before I moved a walking distance away from it, I used to take advantage of every down town visit just so I could grab a cappuccino or a latte. In  4 years I am yet to find a seat in that place and I don't blame others for not wanting to leave: you've got your coffee, an ocean of delicious desserts and sandwiches and internet hotspot. The staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable of best destinations in the area. Hours of operation are same as Starbucks; however, Starbucks can't compete with their coffee. If you want a good Americano, go there and if you're looking to raise the bar of indulgence for that day, drop by Leonida's Chocolate right around the corner and enjoy a few fine Belgian chocolates with your coffee. Your day will suddenly seem nicer =)"}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker but I like my chai lattes.  They make two types of chai latte one with syrup and one not from syrup...if you guessed I like the non-syrup one you guessed correctly.  It has a nice spicy taste, not sweet, and I have it with almond milk and a buttery flaky croissant...nomnomnom!  They are open late which is pretty awesome during the summer when I am walking my dog, and in the winter when I am tired of being held up at home from the cold.  It's nice and cozy inside I almost feel like going there in my onesie pjs!"}
{"text":"I love Tango Palace - I go there to do homework, read, you name it. Decent coffee, decent food, comfy chairs.  I really do like this place a lot, but today's visit was just annoying. The guy working the counter was beyond annoying. He was likely just trying to be friendly and quirky but seriously, when I can't even hear myself think because you're jokingly yelling at some dude to \"get out of my cafe!\", it's time to STFU. I contemplated leaving many times because I couldn't concentrate on my work at all with his yammering.   Oh, and loudly telling your coworker about how you covered for someone else last night because they had a date and you think he got laid, you hope he got laid, you're so proud of him, while you're within earshot of small children - far from cool. The mother did not look pleased.  I will keep going back to Tango Palace, but I really hope I don't have to see this dude again or I'll likely just grab my coffee and go."}
{"text":"Drawn off the sidewalk on my walk home because of the great deal on loose leaf tea (2 25g bags for $5!) and the service was great then. I noticed many people chatting in small groups and mainly studying--on a Sunday evening--and I knew I had to come back and stick around for a while. It proved to be a great study spot with just enough background noise, cafe coziness and charm, and plenty of great snacks and beverages to choose from. I'll be coming back once it's a touch warmer for the back patio experience soon."}
{"text":"Interesting decor - with odd assortment of furnitures, chairs and fixture.  In a weird way, it works well and offers a comfortable space to meet with friends or to sit back with a good book.   Coffee and snacks were good, but nothing that stands out from the many other coffee places in the area.    Internet is spotty and not reliable if you need to do work."}
{"text":"Heard about this coffee shop from a friend, so I thought I'd check it out in this morning. Had a croissant and latte, which came up to $6.75, not cheap but well worth it. Excellent espresso and a wide selection of baked goods.  The decor is very antique homey influenced. Not too bright, but not too dark inside. Music is stellar at an appropriate volume. Also a decent back patio for those wanting some fresh air.   Bonus points for opening at 6:30am (earlier than the other indie coffee shops) and closing at 11pm on weekdays. I think I found my new study place."}
{"text":"You might not give this place a second thought to walk by it, but that would be a mistake.  There are many coffee shops in this neighbourhood but none will make you feel as at home and just downright comfortable as Tango."}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly the best café in Toronto. They do the best espresso/Americano I have ever had outside of Tuscany!!!  The staff are always pleasant, relaxed and friendly, but not overbearing. The decor and atmosphere is cosy and romantic; quiet enough to study or read but there's enough buzz so you can go with friends for a chat.  There's great variety on the menu and some interesting sandwiches and snacks also. I haven't tried their take-home coffee beans but it's on my to do list, as the way they display their coffee-bean wall is really inviting and draws you in!  All in all, a wonderful place to relax and unwind in. Reliable, fast free wifi and chillout music played at a perfect volume rounds off the experience. Slightly on the pricey side but totally worth it. A little piece of what feels like 1800s Paris in Leslieville! Unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Cozy small, but the flax seed chocolate chip cookies were outstanding. Cafe was also yummy. Internet services is not consistent so if you need a place with free Wi-Fi for work don't stop here."}
{"text":"One of the best cafe's in the city. The servers are always friendly, funny and knowledgeable. It's become a popular spot, though, so sometimes it's hard to get a seat during peak hours. This isn't an issue when the patio's open.   Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"It was ok.. Pretty dark, standard place, coffee ok, muffin ok, nice standard service. Nothing bad, but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is my favourite city cafe. The interior is cozy and classic. Though it can be crowded, I always find a spot to sit. They have a huge selection of treats and I usually go for the London Fog or their drip coffee. So satisfying. I love that they are open late! The staff is what makes this place. They are all so kind and friendly."}
{"text":"The guy working at the counter was very nice. They are open late (sunday until 11pm). There where people hanging out and some on their laptop, and another girl reading a book alone. So a few lone sharks looking for peace time in this quite place. Which is quite spacious so it seemed not too busy. Plenty of sweets and drinks to keep you on your game throughout your stay. Wi-fi internet is available and free and they had street parking very close proximity. Great hidden place."}
{"text":"I went to this café because the Ratings talked about great atmosphere and speedy WiFi beside the great taste of the Coffee - The atmosphere is indeed really cosy and chill, wooden floor, comfortable armchairs, A friendly man behind the counter, and the mocha (Medium: $5) was delicious although quite expensive. Negative things: fare away from downtown, reeeally slow WiFi, so going alone for surfing and doing research wasn't worth it, but i would recommend going there with your friends to drink coffee and eat some of the delicious looking cakes :)"}
{"text":"Stepping in, you're greeted to a nicely dim lit room of wood tables and chairs. Popular place that night, and I felt great social atmosphere at this cafe.  The carmeletta, a vanilla & caramel latte we ordered was a little too sweet to my liking. The main reason for coming here wasn't for the coffee..  I came here mainly to eat me some cookies. nom nom nom  The barista probably thought we were nuts because after ordering the latte we proceeded to order 3 large gourmet cookies. \"I'll get this one and that one and whats that one.. oh ok sounds good.. Well get one of those\"   So here we go.. My critique on the cookies   Peanut Butter cCokie -- not very sweet. it has a hint of peanut . there aren't any actual whole peanuts or chopped peanuts inside. guessing it gets it's taste from natural unsweetened peanut butter source, then sweetened with brown sugar. It's a large gourmet cookie about the size of your hand.  I find Kraft's peanut butter cookie recipe, the one that can be found at the back of the jar label yields better tasting cookies IMHO.    Next cookie, the Almond Biscotti. This was decent. Hard and meant for drink dipping. There were chopped almonds in it. It's pretty hard to gnaw on. You'll need iron teeth to eat this thing raw. It makes a huge mess and would meet Cookie Monster approval.. Nom nom.. :)  Last cookie, the Oatmeal Raisin. Just forgettable.. that's what you are. Taste like something I would get from the grocery but soft gourmet type. I can make one better at home.   To sum up I wasn't wowed by the cookies or drink here. You can find better value elsewhere.  However though, the atmosphere is fabulous.. I felt great social energy here. People conversing in groups or in two. Not just acting like a slaves to their notebooks.   It would be a good place to meetup in the neighborhood it has character."}
{"text":"They get so many points for atmosphere. The mood, lighting, and service ensures your comfort. You can actually enjoy a conversation, because the music isn't too loud. The shortbread and soups are also quite good. It seems like they get what a coffee shop is often about: relaxing, chatting, and reading."}
{"text":"Favourite coffee place!  Great atmosphere, decor, food and caffeinated drinks.  Best place to hang out with a book. Also open late till 11pm."}
{"text":"When I passed by, I saw people who were sitting with laptop in Tango Palace, so I thought it would be a good place to work on my project. However, their tables and chairs were low, so it was not the best place to study. The coffee is okay not great but not bad. They have a varieties of baked products. They look okay. Their decoration is nice, but I do not know why their name is Tango Palace."}
{"text":"I've heard this cafe best described as \"an old-style pub with coffee on tap instead of beer.\" The stone walls and eclectic decor definitely match the feeling you would associate with a neighbourhood pub. The comfy, cushioned chairs are most certainly the best part, making it easy for a couple hours to pass without your even realizing. Tango Palace is open early and closes late. They have free wireless internet, making it the perfect place for a makeshift office.   While there isn't much seating outside in the front, there is a lovely closed-in patio out back. It's all shaded with plenty of greenery and for a second you forget you're in a busy city like Toronto.  The coffee itself is also great. They serve Kicking Horse coffee, one of my favourite Canadian coffee brands. Their tea selection is a little sub-par as they only serve tea bags. The pastries however are amazing. They come from Miss Cora's Kitchen in Kensington Market. The squares are all big enough to serve 4-6, the cookies and croissants are always fresh and with plenty of flavours to choose from.  For the most part, the staff is pretty friendly. The evening staff is a lot more welcoming than the daytime staff. Most of them know their customers by name. You may find yourself falling into a conversation with a local Leslieviller at the counter!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Staff is so friendly, coffee is delicious, ambiance is perfect, and WHAT? They're open to 11pm daily?! What more could you ask for in a city where coffee shops shut down at 8pm.  It's a bit cramped, but I'll admit that doesn't bother me here. I quite like the cozy atmosphere and it quickly feels like home.  I can see myself hanging out here a lot over the winter. And summer. And spring and fall."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially in the winter time because it's just so cozy. Sometimes it can get a bit crowded, but the baristas and other patrons are always accommodating, in fact usually when I come here in able to have a conversation with someone interesting. This is also the only place in the city where I will order a hot chocolate, I swear that it's the best. In the summer, they have a very relaxing back patio which is excellent for sitting down and reading a book on, especially since I find the interior to be a little stuffy in the summer.   I also have to add that everyone who works here is usually very pleasant and sweet. I've never tried the food, but all of the drinks seem to be crafted with care."}
{"text":"our favorite way to kill a Saturday morning is to plant ourselves in the comfy lounge chairs at Tango Palace, sip giant mugs of coffee/tea, share a few incredibly addictive fresh pastries, and read the paper.  Two hours has never passed so quickly."}
{"text":"I was greeted by the most chill and delighted barista the east side has ever seen. He asked me how I was. I said \"good\". I asked him how he was. He said \"SO good\", emphasis on SO and emphasis like he meant it.  The toasted bagel was delicious, the jasmine tea was soothing. The chairs and tables and music all fit together like it should. Above all, I love that this place is open late. I'm in love. SO in love."}
{"text":"This is a reminder that there are many types of neighborhood watering holes. They all qualify as \"third places\", a term i use in my e-book on Food and City Building -- a third place after home and work, where people in the 'hood hang out.  One type of third place is like Cheers, where you come to meet whoever is there. But this type is equally important -- a place to have some quiet and special time with somebody. The comfy and elegant chairs are just made for direct face-to-face contact and to put you in a mood to slump and let your hair down.  It really shows how design can make a place and subconsciously tell you what kind of place this is and how you should act.  The coffee is also excellent.  I'd appreciate a few more snacks that lean to the healthy end of the spectrum, and a few more choices that feature local -- even if it's just the baking -- I like to know my money is staying in the community."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a cozy, intimate space with dim lighting and eclectic artwork on the walls. There are a lot of tables in close quarters inside and ample seating on the back patio.   My favourites: -cappuccino -chai latte (both hot and iced, both with dairy milk and soymilk - yum) -steamed milk (I know, not really worth going to a cafe, but sometimes it's just what you need on a chilly day) -homemade lemonade -homemade iced tea -tandoori chicken sandwich (these are not made on site - they order it from somewhere else, and they come prepackaged but I like them anyway)  I will agree with a previous yelper that the nighttime staff is a little more approachable and friendly than the daytime staff, but they all know how to make the hell out of a cappuccino. And really, this is the most important thing, isn't it?   All in all, this is a lovely place to relax, read quietly, write your essay/thesis and/or have a meeting/date."}
{"text":"It's a cozy coffee palace that's open late, makes great coffee and espresso drinks, has delicious snacks, and comfy chairs.  Wonderful place when I want to meet up with a friend someplace that's not a bar."}
{"text":"This place is the type of neighbourhood coffee shop that feels like a neighbourhood in and of itself. It seems that everyone who comes in here is a regular and a local. This morning it was filled with retiree coffee groups, grandparents and grandkids, firefighters, and students (like me!).  On the weekend it's families and people shopping along Queen E.  This coffee shop alone is enough reason to come to Leslieville... Oh, the coffee and comfort food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite coffee places, so much so, that I go out of my way to come here (it's not even close to where I live). I haven't tried their more speciality drinks because I prefer the classics. The drinks are made well. My favourite thing about this place in the ambience, the comfy chairs, and the decor. It's dark and moody but the big windows at the front let in a nice amount of natural light. My only qualm is the music they play. Sometimes great, sometimes not so great. Not top 40 though, so that's good."}
{"text":"Still the most inviting cafe in Leslieville.  My brain works particularly well here, and I guess I owe the proprietors thanks for all the creative work the environment has allowed me to do."}
{"text":"One of the few good places open late. Great treats, great service and nice ambiance. I'm hesitant to write a review because ethen I amy not be able to get a seat here. Love the place!"}
{"text":"The staff here are so nice I sometimes feel there might be hidden cameras.  The place is cozy and a wonderful atmosphere for hanging out, meeting friends, or laptop time.  You can definitely get work done here but there are a lot of tables and chairs crammed into this space and sometimes it can feel a bit cramped.  Nevertheless, I enjoy the place tremendously.   There are lots of plugs for their free wi-fi, and they are open late. They have many options for food and drinks, and they make breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Everything you would want in a cafe. Great food and drink selection, cozy and warm atmosphere with live music."}
{"text":"A great spot to stop after a big meal. Lots of cozy seating and sweet treats in the display case and on the counters. The drink selection was perfect, a drink for everyone, teas, coffee drinks and hot chocolates. The ambience was very relaxing, but there were many people at work on their laptops or reading. I'd love to come back with a good book, have a great cup of coffee and enjoy."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a very cozy spot .the specialty coffee is amazing and the owner is very friendly. Definitely a great atmosphere to go on a date or with friends for an intimate atmosphere. It has a very homey vibe."}
{"text":"Everything you want in a coffee place. It's open in the morning and it's open in the evening. The ambiance is great - nice and cozy. They have so many dessert options, including Nanaimo bars!!!!! Love this place."}
{"text":"The place was lovely, but the coffee and desert was ordinary, nothing special at all. Keep in mind that it is a bit of challenge to find a parking spot if you are driving there."}
{"text":"My fave new retro cafe in TO. Tango is a creative hub filled with cool people, chic old movie house decor, lovely staff, great ingredients like Silk soy milk, and killer ginger cookies. They even sell my favourite beans, Kicking Horse Coffee. Well worth the streetcar ride to Leslieville."}
{"text":"Been here several times. The coffee is good, and the desserts look tasty (but I stuck with just the cookies). It's a comfy place, but can get crowded quickly."}
{"text":"Now that I am back in Leslieville, I decided to prospect one of my favourite cafes in the hood, Tango Palace Coffee Company.  I frequent this place on a very regular basis, the staff is great and knowledgable, the vibe in this place is relaxed and very friendly.  If you want to go in, grab a seat and talk to the other customers about Rob Ford and his latest antics, you can, I actually did that this morning.   I was sitting by the window photographing my muffin and cappuccino and the 2 guys sitting beside me brought up Rob Ford in their conversation and I started to laugh.  Thats all it took for me to get involved in the conversation.  I'm not a big political guy (so we'll leave it at that) but everyone has an opinion about our so called Mayor Rob Ford.   I'm not going to talk about that right now (there's a time and place for that and this isn't the right time nor place) so back to the topic on hand, Tango Palace Coffee Company.   You walk into Tango and the first thing you notice is the antique feel Tango has, with stained glass chandeliers, the very comfy older style armed chairs, the statue hanging from the wall and the beautiful espresso machine.  The display case is filled with fresh muffins, cookies, biscotti, croissants, gluten free options and the list goes on.  Everything looks so delicious that your choice can be very difficult.  I grabbed a cappuccino and a chocolate chip muffin (for some reason chocolate chip muffins are a must have for me, my girlfriend always makes fun of me for it) and sat down right by the window, had a great cappuccino, muffin, did some people watching and had a great conversation with some of the other locals.  What else could you ask for on a Tues morning. Tango Palace Coffee Company has been in the hood for 17 yrs and is still going strong.  It's hasn't been affected by any of the competition that has been popping up in recent years.  That right there tells you about the quality, knowledge and care Tango has for it's consumers.  Check out my full review here.  http://aboutyourhood.com/2013/11/06/tango-palace-coffee-company/"}
{"text":"Attention coffee lovers! This place has a great coffee and a nice ambience! One of my favourite coffee places in Leslieville."}
{"text":"I heart Tango Palace.   I decided to have a lazy Saturday and go explore a bit n Leslieville. After reading some great reviews of this spot I decided to check it out.   The interior is great. Very cozy and comfortable. I am really looking forward to coming here in the winter and having a cup of hot chocolate!   The staff are friendly. They have this great beautiful coffee bah-rew-in ma-chine. I was mesmerized by it.   Points for having cafe au lait. A lot of places don't carry this bowl of beauty. Tango's was pretty good...but a bit on the weak side. For a morning ease into the day cafe - it is perfect.   I also indulged in a chocolate chunk shortbread cookie. Was very good. Not as good as my mom makes...but a pretty decent shortbread.   This place would be great for a first date."}
{"text":"suuuuuuuuper adorable little independent coffee house!  first and foremost: it has cute couch seats and tiny cute tables. that's it I'm sold. but it has more! the menu choice is soooo overwhelming. what other place has white chocolate latte and chocolate chai???? well I say not that many that I know of.  the staff is very very friendly and smiley=)   the coffee machine is vintage and cool looking and adds to the atmosphere.  the atmosphere even though a bit dark but with quite background music and hushed voices only adds to a spirit of an amazing hidden from everyone's eyes magical corner that's only for you and your cup of hot chocolate...."}
{"text":"A real neighbourhood staple, where locals love to meet. Unpretentious yet delicious coffee and snacks, great staff, creative and cozy vibe. If you want a homey place to write your next paper or gossip with your friends, this is it."}
{"text":"Tasty teas and pastries. Too many to choose from. Had the peanut butter cookie last time. Now testing the dark chocolate cherry cookie. So far so good. Enjoying the chamomile lavender tea. Relaxing atmosphere soothing music."}
{"text":"Great place, my favourite coffee house. Tons of great deserts, love the cookies. Plenty of seating instead and more in the back patio. Open late everyday, till 11pm. Free internet. People are respectful, and not too loud.  Starbucks closer to my home in the beaches is always full of people doing business and being loud,"}
{"text":"The first thing that caught me when walking up to Tango was the fact that gave me the feeling of being on Friends but there's no couch.  This place is a little tight with the round tables and chairs on one side of the cafe because the counter is long and has so much to offer on it while behind the counter everything you need from coffee, tea to cold drinks is on the other side.  We were a bit of a group, 8 and we were able to put a few tables together to sit together somewhat like a bunch of tables surrounding a three leafed clover.  This place feels warm and cozy and they happen to have a nice variety of desserts to choose from.  It's funny I always tell everybody I hardly ever eat dessert when now that I think of it anything with a pie crust whether it be a butter tart or a meat pie... I love it.  I ended up getting a butter tart because I sort of craved something sweet after eating a mountain of savory and delicious pizza just down the street I needed something to counter the sodium and hops.  I like this cozy little spot and even though I'm not very close to it I can see us coming back especially if we hit up the pizza place more often."}
{"text":"This was our tea / coffee stopping station when we were in Toronto as it was moments from the place we were staying in. It was wonderful. It has a very relaxed and friendly vibe about it, nice decor and a phenomenally cool copper coffee thingy at the entrance.  I had tea and a scone and both were wonderful and of a decent size. The staff were nice and friendly too.  it's also in a nice little area of Queen Street East - nice vibes, street vibes. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I only have praises for Tango Palace Coffee Company.  There was not one thing that was not to my liking.  From the funny barista to the homey decor to the coffee and finally their selection of sweets....   It really is a neighbourhood coffee joint in that the barista knows the regulars and they carry on a conversation as if they have been friends for a very long time.  The outside has a rather rustic bistro look to it that reminds you of Paris or New York City in the movies.  The furniture is antique wood, the remnants of an antique shop that  used to share the space that is now solely occupied by Tango Palace Coffee Company.  In addition to the normal coffee bar offerings (coffee, lattes, cappuccinos), they have a vast array of biscottis, tarts, cakes, and cookies to go with.  The \"Hammer Head\" caught my eye.  Upon inquiring, I learned that it is made with 2 shots of espresso and a bold coffee... Where was this place in my University days where all-nighters were all the rage?!  The barista had me at 2 shots of espresso.  I also ordered a peanut butter cookie to go with my stronger-than-Arnold java - and I did not regret it.  I have always drank strong coffees, and this really \"hit the nail on the head\" with its intense, dark roasted flavour.  I take my coffee black, and so the peanut butter cookie was the perfect accompaniment for my coffee.  I think I'm in love?  I could see myself coming here to sip on a cup of coffee while reading a book, or sipping a cup of coffee as I blog.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, great coffee. The place a very cozy vibe.  I'll admit I've only been there twice, but I can see how this place could become a regular spot for a coffee and doing a little bit of work."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this little cafe just off of Jones Ave on Queen E. It's a walk away from my house and I never hesitate to stop in for their wonderful atmosphere and delicious food and drinks!"}
{"text":"The offering of raspberry iced tea with or WITHOUT sugar was the first thing about Tango Palace to charm me and their stable, free wifi and cozy furniture kept me smitten."}
{"text":"Nice place! Been coming here at the odd time for years. It's a bit on the expensive side, especially the food/desserts. The food is good and satisfying but nothing too special.   The service is alright. They're nice.   It's always pretty busy here, and the tables are always full."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee house in Leslieville to go to when I am in the mood to read a book, do my homework, or chat with a friend while sitting in a cozy corner under dim lighting for hours with a large mug of Earle Grey tea and a delcious dark chocolate biscotti. The biscotti goes best with an Americano. It offers a very warm atmosphere and is a perfect place to hang out in the winter. Just have two dislikes: they seem to always have top 40 radio selection on instead of some laid back tunes that would go better with the vibe and their cake slices are $7 each!. Bonus: Free Wireless Internet"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have a coffee, chat with a friend, or get some work done.  They have a great selection of coffees, teas, espressos, and according to the barista, over 60 different deserts.  I came here looking for a quiet place to integrate some polynomials. Even though the music was a little loud, I quickly fell into a comfortable zone, with low lighting and energetic music. I'll keep this on my to go list for future work studies.  This ain't a 5 star place in my opinion because the music was kind of loud (apparently it's always loud) for such a chill ambiance, and the chairs and tables are way too small and low, like child's play set. Nevertheless, I will be back."}
{"text":"Last of the \"Kat F - Miss U Crawl\" is Tango Palace Coffee.  I will have to agree with Kat herself as this place has some comfy chairs even at the expense of being very tightly packed together but if you're LUCKY enough to get an Armchair then by all means enjoy the rest of your day while reading/wi-fi-ing/laptoping/sleeping as we were still here around 9 pm.  0.5 *Star* is for their hours of operations, another 0.5 *Star* for the comfortable setting that is comparable(?) to Williams Coffee Pub where I did most of my reading/studying in University.  As for the Cafe Au Lait, it was enjoyable therefore A-OK as my rating.  The solo server at the counter was very pleasant and even generous as he served a couple of our finest EMS officers in need of some pick-me-up(+0.5 *Stars*)."}
{"text":"The only productive atmosphere (in a coffee shop) that I'm able to get work done in. I leave home at 7am sometimes just to come hang here until noon and get some studying done. Staff is always happy to greet you. Amazing gingerbread lattes and sandwiches! Try their seasonal soup if you like cabbage, too!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little café my boyfriend and I happened to stumble along in search of coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxing with a quaint rustic vibe to it, Wi-Fi, and a decent selection of hot drinks to choose from.    I got the cortada which is a Cuban coffee with condensed milk and regular milk used to make it and my boyfriend got the hot chocolate. I loved my choice because it had the perfect punch of caffeine I was looking for considering I just came back from Italy (where the coffee is amazing. My boyfriend's hot chocolate (which I tried myself) didn't really taste like hot chocolate but more like hot milk.  I'd come back here again if I were in the area because the atmosphere is that relaxing."}
{"text":"Tango Palace is located in Leslieville, a neighbourhood full of great coffee places.  I like the vibe of this place - there's a vintage feel, lots of seating, and people just kind of hanging out.  It reminds me of a coffee place from a TV show.  There is an impressive selection of sweets available.  They taste impressive as well.  There are many of them worth trying, so I won't recommend just one.  As for the coffee - it's ok.  In all honesty, it's inconsistent.  Today I had a wonderful Americano.  On other days, the same drink from Tango Palace is a let down.  It ranges from naturally sweet to being too bitter.  Some days, it tastes like the beans are burned.    I'm not sure what they do that creates such a range for their espresso drinks - how it can be wonderful one day and mediocre the next.  It definitely depends on the barista.  It's almost enough to drop my review to 3 stars, but Tango Palace has enough else going for it to keep this at a 4."}
{"text":"Tango Palace is one of the very, very few indie coffee shops in Toronto that actually opens late in the night. A blessing when you or a friend want to hang out and get some stuff done and it's long past 1800h.  The atmosphere is cozy and baristas are friendly. A variety of grub to go with decent drinks. Great music that should be enough to get those damn earphones out of your ears. Or just head to the very back, where you'll find a giant patio, where they will also regularly host musical events.  Also, gotta love the espresso machine they got--a friend remarked it was like a golden steampunk R2D2.  {TTC: any Queen streetcar to Jones Ave.}"}
{"text":"When I walked in here I must say I wanted to start singing the theme song to Friends.  That's exactly what this place reminds me off.  It's cute without being offensively cute and cozy with that low light ambiance  (you know the one I'm talking about ladies - the kind that makes you look GOOD).  It's not big by any means and we were a larger group that put together a few tables and were still a bit crowded but that's ok.  This place lends itself to a chill laid back vibe with exposed brick and worn out furniture (in a good way) where you can get a drink, some pastries and just sit back and read or work on your laptop or go for a casual date.  I only ordered a tea as I was full from dinner earlier on but a few people ordered some cookies and seemed to like them.  I also saw some biscotti at the counter that I'm going to try the next time I wander in and look for Joey.   The bonus is that this place is open later than your normal coffee shops in the area and if you are looking for an after dinner place in the area along Queen St E then definitely hit this place up.  For a coffee/dessert place I was definitely impressed - to get a 4 stars is rare for this kind of low key place but you know when you don't live particularly close but wouldn't mind coming back the it's all good"}
{"text":"Two words:  Carmilla Latte  I love that Tango Palace is right beside a park, I sometimes stop here when I'm walking my dogs, or on the way to Timmie's (the dog store).  They make this delicious caramel and vanilla blended latte - yummy.  They also have soy.  They also have great cookies and stuff.  PS - I love the vintage-y feel"}
{"text":"As much as my coffee intake is mainly from the mainstream places (only because they seem to be at every corner), I am a huge sucker for interesting coffee houses.   One of them which truly stands out in my mind in terms of originality and a good knowledge of their coffee is Tango Palace Coffee Company.  When I venture over to the Leslieville area, I try to stop into Tango to have one of their foamy lattes or indulge in one of their fresh baked goods.   As I eat and drink, I sit in one of their many cushioned chairs and just relax - unlike the mainstream coffee places which are always packed to the point where you can't grab a seat and you just feel rushed.  And as an extra treat in the summer, Tango has a huge back patio for people to enjoy the lovely weather and beautiful sunshine."}
{"text":"The best staff and some of the tastiest desert treats in the city... certainly in Leslieville...  Just an awesome place to hang out!  Chocolate lovers be on the lookout for the espresso brownie!"}
{"text":"I've always been around the area scouring for a good coffee (there are plenty here) but Tango definitely is at the top of my list.   On top of having amazing coffee, they also have an assortment of gluten/flour free baked goods which I appreciate so much! It's so hard to find baked good that are flour free, and the fact that Tango goes out of their way to bake it and make it fresh every morning and tasty gets my vote.   Of course the coffee and treats are a little bit on the pricier end, but it's great quality.   The staff is so likeable, you walk in and you already feel like you're loved. The atmosphere is comfy like many others had said with the casual sofa chairs  and the yellowish lighting. If it's nice, I would recommend sitting outside on the lawn chairs enjoying your coffee while people watching.   It's just a really nice chill place. You can take a date here, study (they have great wifi), your mom, or just come here to relax. It's never too crowded, just enough where you're not the only one and feel bad for leaving when you have to."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indie coffee shop I have visited. You don't even need a coffee here, the atmosphere will do just fine. The service is also great and friendly. They have some breakfast items and great latte. It is a must try place if u are any where east of queen."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious carrot cake"}
{"text":"Hands down, favourite coffeeshop in the city. My S.O. and I swing by this place this at least once a month. Even though we don't live near downtown, we'll make an extra stop in Leslieville whenever we're in for the day. These are the reasons why:   1) Great drinks. We're pleased enough with the café latte and café mocha, which are very smooth and well flavoured. The selections aren't huge, but you can still get a Pumpkin Spiced Latte, Maple Latte, etc. throughout the year. Prices are normal for an independent cafe. 2) Yummy snacks and prepared foods. I've tried various pizzas, tarts, and cakes, and they are all tasty. You can still order food past 9pm, which beats the Pizza Pizza variety expected at this time. 3) Great service. We've seen different baristas at work, and they're all kind and attentive. 4) Sense of community. Local artists display their work here, there's a board promoting freelance services, and locals come by to chat with the workers. The cafe is very integrated with its neighbourhood.  5) Beautiful decor and good ambience. In fact, it deserves a separate list, More Reasons to Love This Place:  1) Open late. Students like myself live strange lives, so a study space open late into the night is 100% my jam. It doesn't turn into a pub in the evening hours either, so introverts can sigh in relief. 2) Plenty of seating and wifi to go around. The code is written on the wall and not mysteriously hidden away. 3) Nanaimo bars. Enough said. 4) Music that doesn't suck and is actually good. I don't know how many times I've gone into a cool cafe, only to be turned off by its horrendous top 40's playlist. Here, you're in for pleasant, mellow beats. 5) Free street parking nearby.  I've yet to visit earlier in the day, and my impressions are limited to the cafe's later hours. Still, this place remains the holy grail for a coffee lover, especially in the late hours. Other cafe owners, watch and learn by Tango's great example."}
{"text":"They make a great latte. They have nice arm chairs to sit on. They also have tables right by the window for you to stare at strangers on the street. Sounds perfect right?  The vibe here is a lot quieter than other coffee shops in the neighbourhood. Maybe because it's further east? Only a few other tables here on a weekday late afternoon / early evening. There were some other people in the cafe but everyone was really quiet and focused on their laptops taking advantage of the free internet. Probably not the right place to come chat up friendly strangers because these strangers don't want to talk to real people."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE it !!! When I imagine what a traditional cafe should look like, Tango Palace is it! I wish more places were able to reproduce this type of charm. Very relaxing and casual atmosphere. Perfect for reading a book, using your laptop, or enjoying with friends. They have all sorts of treats both sweet and savoury, and their coffee is great. I hope they never sell out!"}
{"text":"This is one of the rare, truly \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"-5 star reviews. And it is completely deserved.  First of all, the real reason why I even ventured in there for the first time was the amazing interior and exterior of the coffee shop. As you can see in all the pics on here, it is beautifully decorated, with warm colours, lamps, and chairs. The whole ambiance has a 1920s feel to it, emphasised further by their old-school-looking coffee machine. They have plenty of seating, sometimes to the point where one cannot get out of their chair because there are too many tables/chairs squeezed in the small space. But the best spot is on the window where one has a small table and big comfy armchairs. A hot latte there... perfection.  Talking of which - their coffee is amazing. Never had a bad cup here. They have their \"basics\" and \"advanced\" drinks, and the staff is really friendly and forthcoming so they'll gladly explain the intricacies of the more complicated stuff. Also, their \"large sizes are HUGE. Can sip on those beasts for hours! They also have a wide selection of cookies and pastries to munch on while enjoying your latte, but also other \"real\" food (which I have not tried yet). I've seen some salads, and some sorts of wraps and sandwiches. Not sure what they were though.  Anyway, great baristas and overall customer experience, great ambience, and great coffee and snacks makes Tango Palace definitely my favourite coffee shop in Toronto at this point."}
{"text":"Wandering the neighborhood and stumbled on this place. The coffee is okay, but could probably get a better one somewhere else. This place is just whatever to me. The decor is homely."}
{"text":"There are a few things that are hard not to love about Tango Palace.  First of all, the quirky and cozy interior is great and is probably one of the tops in the neighborhood;  I often easily get lost in a good book in one of their window seats.  Secondly, having an indie coffee place open past 8pm 7 days a week is a rarity in Toronto it seems.  I love that I can get my late night fix at Tango until 11pm.  Coming from Vancouver, I was spoiled with Calhouns near UBC, so I often lamented about the lack of similar places in Toronto. While not 24hrs, Tango Palace definitely fills the void nicely.  Third, they have a great selection of baked goods and other food items (I haven't tried their sandwiches, but I've heard they are delicious).  The counter is overrun with delicious options; there is definitely something for everyone.  I'd say the only knock is that their espresso doesn't quite stack up with the other heavyweights in the neighborhood.  However, with the great atmosphere, hours and friendly staff, Tango Palace carves itself a nice niche in a neighborhood saturated with cafes."}
{"text":"The meeting of Tango Coffee Company and I were written in the stars.  ...well at the very least, the first time I came across the name, it was written in a Best of Leslieville-esque list of a well-respected Yelper. I'd say she qualifies as a star.  Anyways, to set the scene. It's just about 10pm and my dear friend Lai See* and I have been lolling about on the couch for the past two hours. Scattered on the table in front of us are the remnants of what were two canisters of Lays Stax in their past lives, a few lonely unpopped kernels, and oddly enough, a single serving sized cup of microwave apple cinnamon oatmeal. The credits of the romantic comedy we just watched were rolling, and I for one, having been royally screwed over by this year's DST, was ready for an adventure. Having woken up at an unmentionable time in the afternoon (evening?), I felt obligated to compensate by staying out all night and early morning. But what a conundrum...somewhere that was nearby, not a bar, new to us, and actually open (see: not a bar). Lo and behold, Yelp saves the day. Zero point three kilometres away? Check. Four star average rating? Check. Never before been? Check check check. Lai See later told me she had scoped out their washroom once, but we won't count that.  The large, retro brass espresso machine behind the counter was very impressive. As was the drinks menu, quaintly separated into two blackboards - one titled \"The Basics\" and the other \"Advanced\". Wanting to impress the attractive barista, I opted for an off-menu Dirty Chai and Lai See went for a white mocha. I think the both of us had resigned ourselves to not sleeping that night. Since impending sleep calories weren't a problem, a slice of Chocolate Sin was added to list. Who am I kidding? Calories, schmalories, it was on the list before we walked in.   For those unacquainted, a Dirty Chai is just regular masala chai \"dirtied\" by a shot of espresso. Tango mixed up a delightful one, the spicy-sweet mellowness cut through by caramel bitter. Lai See reported a likewise good White Mocha, and the accidental sip I took confirmed it. What? It was on *my* side of the table! Note that she's a leftie while I'm right-handed.  The cake was aptly named, very rich and dense with a thin sliver of crunchy espresso cream in the middle to break up the texture. I'd definitely recommend splitting this between two people, it can be a bit much on the flavour scale, despite the smallish size.   The atmosphere of this coffee house couldn't be better. The little round tables flanked by stiff armchairs, the tiled ceiling and exposed brick, the chalkboards advertising henna and tarot readings on certain days at certain times, all topped off by that odd Roman-looking sculpture suspended halfway up a wall. In a way, I feel like Tango *is* somewhere that should be visited at 10pm...walking in during broad daylight would make it lose part of its magic. Lai See and I were also big fans of the music, which seemed to match the intensity of our Bananagrams duel to the death.   The barista was lovely and didn't kick anyone out as the clock hit closing time. In fact both we and a group of four right behind us must of stayed fifteen minutes past eleven. Like I said, he was great. As a side note, the Tango prices can be a bit surprising. Our two medium drinks and a slice of cake came to just under $18. I'm not saying it's not worth it, but don't drop by with just change jingling in the butt zipper of your biking shorts.   Needless to say, all that caffeine and sugar packed a punch right to the face. Hours later, I'd be rolling restlessly in bed until dawn, cursing the chai's deceptive deliciousness and swearing off caffeinated beverages for life in a fit of grumpy sleep deprivation.   ...Tango Palace Coffee Company can expect me back tomorrow; oaths sworn at 4am were never meant to be taken seriously.  *names were changed to protect the (somewhat) innocent"}
{"text":"Really warm and cozy. This place has charm with it's old armchairs and worn out furniture an exposed brick walls. The coffee is great, the desserts are amazing.  The coffee could be slightly better. Extra points for being open till late."}
{"text":"I do not like this place and I do not understand the rave reviews.  The main reason for my displeasure is that the guy who makes the coffee seems to hate me.  He radiates dissatisfaction when he sees me (which has happened all of two times).  The good: - It's near the 7-11 where I use the bank machine - It's always open - There are a lot of baked goods availabe  The bad: - The guy hates me (see above) - I don't like their coffee - They make a very traditional cappuccino with a LOT of foam... this might not be bad to you if you are a purist, but I am not.  I really just want a small latte, and most places call that cappuccino.  - The apple cinnamon muffin I had last week wasn't great, but it LOOKED like it was going to be... so I was extra disappointed.  The weird-and-not-cool: The door is really hard to open, and it opens awkwardly into the place.  I always end up crashing into the room like a drunk elephant.  Maybe that's why the guy gives off such bad juju when he sees me.  Meh.  Will I go here again? Not if I can avoid it.  I would go to Red Rocket next time.  I would have this time too if I had had more time."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I live downtown but there in the \"outskirts\" of Leslieville there is a quaint little coffee shop with the utmost homey feel. The dim lighting, the grandma's dining room chairs, the dusty pink paint on the walls, the stained glass windows and chandeliers... It's romantic almost. I usually find grandma style decor tacky and outdated but it felt cozy. I love the ambiance and the exposed brick. The painted metal ceiling is pretty cool too. The only thing taking away from the decor is the fluorescent lit cooler of baked goods. Luckily it's at the end of the shop close to the \"garden\" (wtf?)  They have a house blend espresso. They also seem to sell beans so maybe they roast too? (or get stuff roasted at least). Their Elektra espresso machine looks pretty sci-fi, like a giant bullet from the Golden Gun meets R2D2, crowned with a bald eagle. The barista guy seemed to really know how to prepare espresso and he wasn't happy with the first pour so he re-did it. I didn't even say anything, it was all him. I appreciate details like that. He is very chipper and friendly and appears to love his job and people. I love people like that. He helps add to the warm, homey feel of the place.  The espresso was quite delicious... No complaints at all. Yum. Thinking about it now. The chocolate chip cookie was not as good as he said it was. Kind of oversized and floury tasting but still pretty decent. Tasted very homemade, but baked by someone who didn't really know how to bake yet.  Not sure what the deal is with the 2-star review unsatisfied with the cappuccino. If you don't like the foam of a proper cappuccino then don't order a cappuccino! If you want a small latte order a short latte. Or maybe it's called a macchiatto. I'm assuming the dissatisfaction comes from not knowing how to order. The espresso is a good base and I'm going to assume it'll make a good latte/macchiatto/cappuccino/whatevs.  Even though the cookie wasn't stellar, it was pretty decent and maybe takes 0.5 of a star away... The way I felt in the shop made me all warm and fuzzy for some reason so this place gets 5-stars.  I'm never in the area but when I am I'll be coming back! Might have to make the Burger's Priest + Tango Palace combo a regular venture to the east side of town."}
{"text":"A great little coffee place that also has a variety of herbal teas for those of us who can't handle coffee at night!  Open til 11 and the desserts!  The Espresso Brownie has lovely bittersweet tones of dark chocolate and espresso and a decadent moist and chewy center.  Will definitely be back... even if just to drop in and pick up another brownie!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Service from the one guy working closing was BAD. I was excited to try their desserts as I heard good things about it.   As we're telling him what drinks and desserts we'd like to order, the guy at the counter demands us to order our drinks first before ordering our cakes. Funny how this 'barista' thinks it's the customer's job to serve his needs.  Desserts were good, but nothing extraordinary. The cherry cheesecake was a large piece, and their peaNOT butter chocolate bar was quite interesting as well. Also ordered another chocolate brownie bar which was alright.   As my group was chatting, eating, etc we had a few pieces of each dessert left on our plates. The same male worker came over to our table, took our forks, stacked one plate on top of the unfinished peanot butter dessert and THEN asked if we were going to finish the brownie. Uh....you just took our forks away, PLUS didn't bother asking if we were done our desserts yet....so I guess you already decided for us that we won't?!?   Won't be coming back based on this truly weird experience from that guy. You're an independent coffee shop, you should probably have better service than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Went here on a date recently--date was horrendous, but Tango Palace was great. Menu has a decent selection to choose from, although the tiniest bit pricey for my taste. I had a cream cheese and smoked salmon bagel, and an iced coffee. Both were satisfying, the coffee is especially great.   They have a pretty little patio out in the back, very welcoming, open space I would love to spend more time in, especially later at night. The inside is lovely as well, very cozy and comfortable. This is somewhere you could easily burn hours in just reading with a cup on the side, studying, etc.   The staff are probably my favourite part of this place, aside from the decor. Super friendly and accommodating, generally just people you like being around and make the cafe even better.   Will definitely be back. Share this place with your friends!"}
{"text":"Came here post-dinner, while looking for somewhere to hang out and get desserts on a Friday night.   Was very impressed with the vibe of this place - it had nice decor, and a very cozy feeling to the room, almost like we were on a set location for a Hollywood RomCom. Though we came in a large group, this place is most ideal for a first date or grad students looking for a place to catch up on grading.   I actually wasn't too impressed with the cookies (Chocolate Chip Cookie and \"Everything Cookie\"), though they have a good selection of desserts, coffees, teas, etc. The server behind the counter was quite friendly, which only helped contribute to the comfortable atmosphere here."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this quaint cafe while we out in Leslieville. Inside - there is a warm laid back feel - I can imagine grabbing a coffee and sitting out by the window. There are comfy chairs by the window, small round tables and 3-4 Muskoka chair out front. Coffee was good and there was a great selection of food (sweets and sandwiches). If I lived close by, this would be my go to place for coffee. Love the vibe and coffee"}
{"text":"Love Tango Palace for soooo many reasons. To name a few:  1. the wonderful atmosphere... at the risk of sounding like a walking cliche, this is the BEST coffee shop to get some writing done... i can just zone out; 2. great music... i rarely take off my headphones in a cafe...Tango's is good fun; 3. Wonderful staff- warm, friendly, always ready with a joke or wink... they make my day; 4. Patio in the back! Great for sneaking in a smoke or fresh air paradoxically. ...what am I forgetting. Oh!  5. the coffee. lol.Right. Hands down great snack and drink selection.   No longer live in Leslieville but seriously considering making the trek to frequent this go-to again.   I RECOMMEND: Fighting for the window seat. It's worth it if you're a people watcher lol.   EXTRA TIP: Watch out for the 'coons in the patio area. They run sh*t and one nearly pissed on me. DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT, I REPEAT, AVOID EYE CONTACT WITH THE RACOONS. It's real."}
{"text":"I wish there are more charming and individual coffee places like Tango Palace Coffee Company near where I live or work!!  I really love the dark and cozy interior.. and the little worn and comfy airmchairs.  What's better than hanging out with friends and talk nonsense over a cup of coffee?? What's better than to bring my laptop and utilize the free WIFI over a cup of coffee??  I am no coffee guru..but what they serve here taste all right for me and love drinking my coffee from a big thick mug!"}
{"text":"A real cozy cafe - love the atmosphere. Got my latte to go - medium size was giant! Minus a star for the milk to espresso ratio, though. I think it could've used an extra shot but that is just me. Definitely worth the money, all in all. Barista was knowledgeable and very friendly! I'll be back the next time I'm in Leslieville."}
{"text":"For my liking Tango Palace is rather unpalatial. It's diminutive and dark with a palette of dark wood and burgundy. The decor has a hint of antique to it, and there are a few cozy armchairs and couches amidst a serious amount of tables.   On my visit I enjoyed a just OK brewed coffee. I was happy with the portion size (a medium is quite huge) but it wasn't terrific and a little weak. There is definitely a lot of pastry on offer; I spotted cakes, pies, butter tarts, cookies, and pre-made sandwiches. They also have a wide assortment of teas and espresso.  The tight layout makes it unlikely I would spend long swaths of time here, but I might stop by again for a coffee to go.  Obligatory Title Pun: It takes TWO to TANGO.  Menu Readability: Chalkboard sign.  Need to mention: They have free Wi-Fi.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm rather particular about the use of the term \"palace.\""}
{"text":"Still a solid place to get work done and the only place in the area that's open till 11pm. Armchairs are cozy and the wi-fi is reliable, even when every single person in the cafe has a laptop in tow.  The shitty, sticky front door has been replaced (I was there the day that it literally shattered when someone slammed it too hard) and weatherproofing installed so the drafty front area is no longer a problem.  I don't like the hot chocolate (it tastes soapy), sandwiches (bland) or any of their baked goods (the fact that the tins are all full at 10pm nightly gives you pause) so I usually stick to straight up tea or pop and the occasional biscotti. But seriously - come here to get work done: you'll find SOMETHING to drink/eat."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. I'm not a coffee person. Their latte was good... Kinda had a diff after taste like cinnamon or something. A different kick and flavor. Slight bitter/roast.  No almond croissants. The plain was ok - fluffy and airy but not crispy outside.  I really like the ambiance inside- so cozy. You can bring a date - a first date. A few choices of food to eat so not just coffee. Nothing fancy.  ---- note this review was actually made 2 yrs ago but I didnt press post until now"}
{"text":"Best small independent coffee shop in Toronto. Coffee and pastries taste very good, friendly people, comfortable chairs (well, at least the ones at the window) and most importantly: open late, until 11pm."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the city to go and enjoy a coffee. Thy make a great espresso and cappuccino and for those with sweet teeth, they have no shortage of desert options. The coffee is good but the ambiance is even better.  Small tables and chairs with a few upholstered chairs in the window.  This is literally where you go with a book and just turn off for a few minutes.   In the summer, they have Muskoka chairs out front so you can chill out and watch the street go by."}
