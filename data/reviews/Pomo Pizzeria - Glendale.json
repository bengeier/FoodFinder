{"text":"Incredibly disappointed, being an Italian food lover to (the point where I have learned to make pasta in Rome) ..  I am truly disappointed by the quality of the lasagna here. When I put my fork into it,  i saw a cube of carrot and soon realized to stretch the sauce I guess they blended carrots in the \"meat\" sauce. Anyone who has had authentic lasagna wound know the sauce is red because of the pure tomato based meat sauce which is paired with bechamel. Look at the color of this lasagna! It's orange? Plus the top is burnt? ? I will not be going back again,  plus it costs $17.00 for take away.. smh"}
{"text":"Let me first say, if your idea of good pizza includes going to pizza hut, little caesar's, or baking something that was frozen from the grocery store, this place is probably not for you. You're probably better off going across the street to Zipps for their happy hour pizza slices for less than $2. If on the other hand, you are willing to pay for a quality meal filled with a top notch ingredients and a bunch of flavor, then go here.

I came here alone for a late lunch, around 1:30ish pm, and there was a very a light crowd. I was immediately seated, given some water, and a menu by my friendly waiter, Mike. I had already looked through the menu online before coming, so I knew what I wanted. I ordered a glass of their Cabernet and their Principe pizza. The pizza is a thin crust, Neapolitan pizza. It had prosciutto, fresh arugula, and shaved parmigiano reggiano. It was absolutely delicious. The pizza and the wine tasted great together. I would love eating this pizza every week. I am still debating whether or not I like this pizza better than the one at Pizzeria Bianco. 

The pizza is quite large and would definitely need 2 people to finish it. I had a very long lunch though, so I slowly worked on it for about 45 minutes while doing some work on my phone. I was never rushed and my waiter was attentive to me the entire time. He actually also gave me some spicy olive oil to try on my pizza. I added a few drops, and it definitely brought out some more kick and flavor to the pizza. I would recommend not adding too much though otherwise you'll drown out the original flavors of the pizza. 

Some people complain about the price, but to me, I will always be willing to pay extra for good quality food. Period. The prices for their food are on their website, so don't whine about paying too much. I am just super thankful that this place opened up near where I live. I will definitely be back again to try out the rest of their wonderful menu."}
{"text":"Had a group event there, tried a variety of pizzas, the were good but overpriced. Tried the calamari, very overpriced and over cooked. Probably wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Seriously just walked out of this place!  The manager was such an ass with the attitude that I should feel lucky to be in his restaurant!  Additionally, when inquiring about happy hour we were told only at the bar. Seriously, not a good start for a new business. I won't be back. Instead we went to Zipps. Way more accommodating."}
{"text":"Have gone twice now since it opened on the West side... So happy there is finally a decent pizza place close by. The staff are friendly and attentive. The pizzas are full of flavor and the presentation is great. The Caesar salad and calamari were so-so, however the two desserts I have tried were amazing. One was a cream puff type dessert with chocolate sauce and the other was tiramisu. Both beautifully presented and tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I dream about this place! Everything is wonderful. I also bought the lemon and the chili oil... Now I cook amazing too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza, plus a fairly varied menu of other non-pizza items (salads, sandwiches, pasta, etc.) that I can't wait to work my way through trying on future visits! That plus great service and a really gorgeous restaurant makes this a place we'll definitely be coming back to again and again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! From the moment we walked in to moment we left, this was a fantastic experience. Staff was friendly but gave us space, the food was superb. The appetizer of rice ball thing was really unique and delicious. The prinicipe pizza was so good I wish I could have eaten the whole thing. Our server was awesome and it's a great location and ambiance. I'd like to go next door to try toscana next. I'll definitely be back. Most likely later this week. Oh, and they have a few gluten free options if you have a diner who requires that."}
{"text":"A dining experience! Four of us and all very pleased. We had veal, pork tenderloin and gnocchi -truly authentic. A delightful place and can't say enough about the attentive and friendly staff. Beautuful owner / manager is from Rome. And must mention a lovely bottle of wine for $18. Nice."}
{"text":"Wow. The first and only word out of the Greeter's mouth was, \"four?\" Not another word. Our waiter Dillon was excellent. He portrayed the same class that the ambiance was attempting. The range of food options was very limited. Our waiter tried to offer us some variety. However the chef said he had \"limited ingredients\". The pizzas were average in taste and severely lacking in ingredients.  It was no wonder the restaurant was half full at 7 o'clock on Saturday. A lot of wasted potential."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Seems like it's really authentic. I've never been to italy and can't read Italian but a lot of the menu was Italian words or phrases that both me and who I was eating with had a hard time understanding.

It's certainly a different type of pizza than I am used to. Sauce was pretty tasty but I'm not a big fan of the style of pizza they serve and it was a bit on the pricy side for lunch. The side salad was good. 

Some people may like it but it didn't suit my taste all that well"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally did tonight. My husband and I liked the decor and it was modern and has a nice patio. I ordered the Lasagna and was disappointed with the taste and presentation. The sauce looked orange/brown ( had a striking resemblance to Chef Boyardee) and didn't even have mozzarella cheese on it. This entree was a bit on the pricey side too. My husband oddly said the same about his dish (sausage pasta dish) that it had a striking resemblance to the Chef Boyardee chilli mac sauce as well. Not sure if this is a knock against the restaurant or a compliment to Chef Boyardee. Not bad but not impressed.  Pasta was good.  $2 charge if you want bread (cheap, cheap, cheap...).  Service was good."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, awesome Frito Misto (calamari & shrimp) their pizza is very comparable to Pizza Bianco- Will try their other locations."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Chicago., pizza capital  The servers were friendly and the pizza delicious. I ordered the 4 cheese and ate the whole thing. No complaints except they close at 10pm. I wasn't ready to leave."}
{"text":"I went to this location on 5-14-15 for my wife's birthday. We were accompanied by friends and family, my mom surprised us and brought a cake in from nothin bundt cakes. The hostess gladly put the cake in their refrigerator, after our meal my mom said I have cake for everybody. The waiter came up and then continues to tell us that we are now going to be charged $2 dollars extra per person for the inconvenience of bringing in our own desert. We were in shock because we were told after we ate our meal, the 24 extra dollars is not the issue but rather the fact that they told us after we ate our meals and had refrigerated the cake. The manager was the person who stood in the background watching the whole situation, the waiter was completely uncomfortable but the manager was watching him as he continued to restate his claim that we will now be charged $2 per person. My dad went to speak with the manager and he started to argue with my dad. After a few minutes they agreed to let us eat the cake. We will no longer be customers of this restaurant and I would recommend thinking twice before giving your hard earned money to an unruly manager."}
{"text":"The most amazing service and pizzas ever so much flavor, host was so kind and sweet and my server was fantastic! Also the mixed drinks at the bar are fabulous! I'm so pleased with everything and cant wait for toscana to open up!"}
{"text":"Outstanding addition to restaurants near to the Midwestern University campus! Superb Panini's! So happy you are here. Ingredients are exceptionally tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Went here the other day with the family.  We got a couple of pizzas and fried rice balls.  All was good.  Nice authentic Italian flavors.  The pizzas are cooked in a stone fire place nice crispy crust.  Prices were pretty reasonable.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to the new 59th citadel location was greeted by the hostess seated to our table very cute atmosphere decor was perfect. I want to sit outside next time. Our waitress Gina was very knowledgable about the menu we had pizza and salad that two people can share its so big. The owner Fernando I think that was his name was so nice to check on how our service was. Food was delish! I really liked the lady who came around and let us try the different olive oils with bread to try. The lemon one was to die for yum! Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous flavorful pizza. It was a Capricciosa wood fired and delicious. Service was terrific and they really cared that my dining experience was good. I'll be back.
Thank you Elma, your recommendations were spot on."}
{"text":"This is one of the few certified Neapolitan Pizza places in Arizona and, on my opinion, the best pozza in the State!
Many varities and all prepared perfectly.
If a first time authentic Neapolitan Pizza eater, try the Margherita - the basic pizza and a great introduction to this style :-)"}
{"text":"Well it's brick oven pizza & I fin their all pretty much the same. Nothing special here. Expensive for a little dough cheese & tomato. I had to go eat after I left because I was still hungry,"}
{"text":"This place just opened up by my parents so I decided to give it a try. 

Right when you walk in, you actually have two options. To go to Pomo or to their adjoining restaurant (I don't remember the name). Though both seem to share a kitchen, Pomo is more for pizza while the other restaurant is more for pasta. This was kind of confusing and actually made me rethink the place that I wanted to go to! Nevertheless, my friends and I ended up at Pomo. 

The whole area is big, and they have an open patio area for outdoor seating as well. The waiter was pretty good and he gave us some recommendations. We ended up ordering drinks, an antipasti, and two pizzas. Out of the three drinks we got, the Moscow mule was the best with blood orange. The two others were just ok. The affetatti misti was alright for the price. The pizzas were good. We got one white one off the menu the waiter recommended and it was my favorite. The red one we got was good too but I thought it needed just a little something more. 
Overall, it was a good dining experience and it's a nice spot to go to!"}
{"text":"This was previously Tutti Santi. Interior was redone to make it \"trendy.\" 

Was a bit worried when we arrived and the hostess asked which side we wanted - one she referred to as EYE-talian. Ugh. It's IT-alian. Otherwise, we're pretty sure you make horrible Italian food. 

To add to that, the music playing was Spanish, not Italian. #fail

Food was good, but expected better for what we paid. $120 for 5 of us (2 of the 5 ate from the kids menu). Most surprising were the appetizers. Got the meatballs and the arancini and both were delicious. Gnocchi was pretty bland. Kids pasta was too. 

Nothing to write home about. We may try it again only because it's close."}
{"text":"Not bad , a little pricey. At the end of day it was not a bad experience . Awarded Analynn's"}
{"text":"Amazing! Service was great. Food was delicious. Variety was wonderful. While visiting family over the holiday weekend we decided to meet at the centrally located Glendale restaurant. We ordered the Bruchetta trio appetizer. Prepared fresh, delicious. We all would definitely visit this establishment again!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy authentic pizza with fresh ingredients this is the place to go.  Our family tries to go here at least once a month since they opened.  The service is fantastic and the staff really cares.  We've only had one bad experience were the server forgot to put our order in and we got stuck behind a large group.  The manager however saved the situation with a free desert for our daughter and the whole meal free and prepared it to go.  Great to have a place like this in the NW Valley."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, def try the tortellini. Staff was meh, unfriendly and seemed rushed the entire time possibly under staffed"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wonderful wait staff.  Went there with my sister, ordered caprese, pizza, and spaghetti.  We ordered  olive oil and garlic on the spaghetti and we were surprised that we were charged $16.95, the most expensive.  For oil and garlic, come on, really.  We planned on sharing it, but the portion was so small we had to order a pizza.  Also, no bread was served with it, and for a restaurant who advertises \"authentic\" Italian we were disappointed there was no fresh shredded cheese available, just a shaker on the table with grated cheese.  We probably won t be going back.  We will drive the extra distance and go to Maggianes in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's probably my fault for not asking more questions. I got there ten minuted before they were shutting down lunch.  I ordered what the waitress said was good.
   When I got it home is WAS A DEEP FRIED PIZZA!!  Holy Crap.
 Do Not order the deep fried pizza.
  Not very healthy. And not good at all. Will 
never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the northwest side of town hands down.

Pomo took of the spot Tutti Santis held down.  Although I was a fan of Tuttis if something had to take its spot this would be the one!  Ive had several of their pizzas and they were all amazing.  I really dont think you can go wrong.  In fact my new goal is to try them all.

If you like excellent ingredients and pizza this place is a must try for anyone nearby."}
{"text":"I gave this place two tries before giving my honest opinion. The place is hidden inside the little shopping center on 59th. You get seated quickly on the two times I went I didn't get a waiting time and it wasn't that packed. They bring our water right away even if you don't ask for it which is really good. I didn't really have like one waiter because multiple waiters will come by and ask you how everything is doing and if you need anything which is really good. I order the STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA (pasta) the first time I was there with the Forno bread which was only 2$. The pasta was amazing just not a big size so I had to eat a lot of bread with it to be stuffed the Forno bread comes with olives but with seeds. I would really wish they were seedless because the olives are small and hard to eat and also don't want to pick seeds out of my mouth at a restaurant. The second time I had the PIZZA CHEF pizza which was also very delicious. This pizza had nothing wrong with it. Both those entrees were delicious. The coffee I had at the end was not good at all I put 4 packs of sugar and it still tasted sugarless. The tables are also small if you only have one or two people, couldn't really fit the entrees we had on the table we had to move things around. For a pizza and pasta spot this place is good and feels fresh and tasty. The prices are a little hefty being the small pasta was 16$ and is not enough to fill you up if you don't have bread. Make the portion bigger or lower the prices and this could be a five star joint."}
{"text":"Eat the \"STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA\". It is fantastic. Great beer list for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in Phoenix, especially from pizza snobs from NYC and just traveled recently from Italy! I love that they are authentic and everything is imported!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place. I went last Sunday 7/31/16, my pizza was good but I wasn't impressed by it. I love me some pizza! I felt that I've had better pizza elsewhere. So, I was bummed that when I got my pizza it just seemed bland and nothing special. The pricing here is ok. However, the pricing would be justified if the pizza was actually AMAZING. But in my opinion, I felt I've had better pizza at Grimaldis."}
{"text":"Great pizza in the NW Valley. The service was great, nice ambiance and outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"Sometimes the waiter can make all the difference in making it a memorable experience.  And Mehie, the Italian waiter who has only been in this country for 4 years, really tried.  The fault was definitely not his.  He was engaging, tried to please, and did a good job of explaining the menu, even with his heavy accent.  We started our dinner outside at the bar during Happy Hour.  Great HH prices, by the way.  Mehie was our bartender and then became our waiter once our table was ready inside.  First, we asked for the same Chianti that we were drinking at the bar and were informed that the Chianti we had was only available at the bar and anything comparable was now $9.  OK...we understood.  Now, we asked for some bread while we waited for our dinner and were informed it was an additional $2.00 for four small slices of bread with dipping oil.  OK.  We ordered.  Wanted a small dinner salad to accompany our pasta.  Nope.  The cheapest salad was $9.95, which my husband and I decided to split.  It was SO MUCH salad, it was almost ridiculous.  Tons of spring mix with a few cherry tomatoes, I think 3 slices of cucumbers and some shaved cheese.  On the plus side, my dinner, which Mehie recommended was delicious.  Strozzapreti Salsiccia, a fresh pasta w/ italian sausage, i a light creamy tomato sauce.  Our firends Gnocchi, however, was less than desirable.  Mehie suggested a light, creamy gorgonzola sauce instead of the traditional red sauce.  It was drenched in a heavy, cheesy sauce.  Also on the plus side, Mehie brought us complimentary cannolies for my birthday and they were yummy.  The place was empty.  I think we know why."}
{"text":"To my west sider friends, congratulations!  You are now in the presence of greatness (and no, I'm not talking about me).  You my friends are now among those privileged enough to call Pomo Pizzeria your own.  This is my favorite pizza in the entire state of Arizona.  And its not just me.  If you look up the top ten restaurants in the Phoenix metro area on Yelp, you will find Pomo's Downtown Phoenix location consistently ranked in the top 10 day in and day out.  With good reason.  This is a pizzeria that puts a premium on quality ingredients, great service, and authentic old world Italian traditions.  Their Downtown Phoenix location has never let me down and today I took in their latest gem in Glendale.

Located on 59th Ave just north of Utopia in the Citadelle shopping center, Pomo occupies what used to be Tutti Santi's Glendale location.  Not that you'd recognize it as Pomo has completely transformed the space into an expansive pizzeria with an indoor/outdoor bar, and selling a variety of Italian grocery items.  For those who have been to Pomo's flagship location in Scottsdale, this location will remind you a lot more of that location than the Downtown Phoenix location.  Its much more of a suburban restaurant feel here than the quaint neighborhood joint in Downtown Phoenix.  Not that either is bad, since both are cranking out the same delicious pies at both.  Today I came here for lunch since I work in the west valley.  The place can seat upwards of 100, but was no more than half full for lunch.  A coworker who'd been with me to the Downtown Phoenix location decided to come along.

Just so you know, I used to live in the Glendale/Peoria area for 8 years before moving Downtown in 2013.  I know the west valley is dominated by the big chain pizzerias like Barros, Papa Johns, Domino's Hungry Howies, and even Pizza Hut.  Pomo's pizza is absolutely nothing like those spots.  Here the pizza is thin Neapolitan style and a majority of their ingredients are imported direct from Italy.  You pay a little more for your pies here as a result, but the difference in the taste is like night and day.  Everything from the texture of the tomatoes, to the import cheeses, to the imported olive oils, all the way down to the crust itself is different.  As in awesome.  Today my coworker and I ordered a couple of our Pomo standbys, the Margherita (basically a cheese pizza) and the Diavola (almost like a pepperoni).  The pies are 12 inches in diameter each and can be easily shared or (in our case) devoured by one hungry pizza lover.  Everything about the pies tasted just as perfect here as their Downtown location.   We also split a Tiramisu for dessert which will blow your mind.  Its light and airy, but plenty rich and just the right temperature and the perfect portion size to split.  

Our server was super friendly, enthusiastic, and attentive the whole time.  In fact one thing that's noticeable about Pomo versus other restaurants is that they almost overstaff each of their restaurants, which means you can pretty much bank on immediate service no matter when you go or where you're sitting.  The full bar area at this location is also pretty impressive and would make for a great happy hour spot since it opens up both inside and on the outside patio.   So bottom line, get here to Pomo west siders.  You won't find a more authentic pizzeria (with the Italian pizzeria certifications to back it up) in the northwest valley.  Better than any chain pizzeria, better than La Piazza al Forno, and yes better than Pizzeria Bianco (both in my opinion and in the opinions of hundreds of other loyal Yelpers).  This location might be a little hard to find, but its worth the effort.  Just look for huge outdoor patio across from Zipps at Citadelle.  And prepare yourself, because chances are you never knew pizza could ever taste this good."}
{"text":"Pomo Pizzeria: The West Side has hit the motherlode.  In a zip code serendipitously housing some of the more wealthier Phoenicians comes the icing on the cake.  Pomo Pizzeria has opened their third location in the valley.  After cutting their teeth on the unsuspecting minions of Scottsdale and Phoenix, they've unleashed a fine selection of pizza, salads, desserts, and cocktails aptly designed to crush that craving for authentic Italian pizza

The P(rincess) and I have been to Pomo three times in that few months and it's quickly becoming her requested date night location (or the place I take her to make up for being away on work travel). We typically split one of their wood fired, san marazano tomato-based pizzas and one of their salads designed for two small armies.  We finished the last meal with the nutella flourless chocolate cake which made my eyes roll back into my head (still trying to get the left one to face forward).  It was excellent, wonderful way to cap the meal.  

The service is always perfect and the house cocktails expertly mixed-(one for me as the P needs me to drive home up the hill). The decor is comfortable, the bar is well laid out, a couple of games on the discreet TV's (if you're up for a loud, game type atmosphere just head across the parking lot to Zipps, a fun place).  If the famous Phoenix weather allows, I recommend the patio also, very relaxing.  The parking can be a little tight in the shopping center but here's a tip, park behind the center on the north end. They have a back door/take out entrance that takes you through the kitchen ala Durants-always fun and its never a bad thing to see the kitchen where your food comes from.

Solid 4.25 stars."}
{"text":"This location was excellent! My all time favorite experience with the Pomo family.Entering the front entrance to the lobby was warm and welcoming and continued into the dining area. I love the open lay out. There is a small break between the bar area just to distinguish the two but nothing dramatic. The windows are floor to ceiling all around you so you can see out to the patio, which I love.  It's safe to say I was a big fan of the ambiance, set up, and whole feel of this place.

My friend and I were greeted by a young Italian man who served us through the night. I wish I would have gotten his name. He was funny, charming, and very attentive to all our needs. I had a glass of the house red wine. It was mild bodied but not too sweet. I would order it again. When the time came for us to order we knew we wanted to share a pizza and a pasta. We decided on the TOTO SAPORE: tomato sauce, mozzarella, italian sausage, cotto-ham, spicy salame, pancetta, salame parma, basil, evoo * 16.95 - It was perfect! The crust stayed crunch, and had a  bit of char on it, the meat's didn't over power one another, and you were able to get the fresh basil taste throughout.        And for our pasta, we just weren't sure what we wanted. We asked our waiter what he recommended and he pointed out the STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA: fresh pasta w/tomato sauce, italian sausage, light cream, rosemary & parmigiano* 15.95 - I've never had a more delicious plate of pasta in my life. If this is what homemade pasta tastes like... I wish I would have had an Italian grandmother. That's all I could think when enjoying this dish. \"This is what it would taste like if I had a grandmother, who was from Italy and made pasta from scratch. No doubt about it.\" I do not know what type of pasta this was but it was a little bit chewy in the middle (I think they call that Al Dente... haha. :) ) something I very much enjoyed. The pasta sauce was thick and hearty. The sausage was season and cooked to perfection. That perfect amount of rosemary in every bite was fantastic. 

After the server boxed up our 1 slice of pizza and our 3 spoonful's of pasta left overs. (I was not about to waste one bit.) We ordered the cannoli's. Something I'm not a hug fan of in general but my friend very much enjoyed. Crunchy outside, gooey inside, Nutella and strawberries to garnish the plate. 

After we paid and got up to leave, there were several servers and hostess's in the lobby smiling with a \"Ciao Bella's!\" as we walked out the door. What is better than that!?

I'm so glad I gave this location a try. It's everything I have been looking for in an Italian place and I'm so happy it's oh so close to home. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pomo is definitely one my favorite pizza spots in the valley! The crust is insanely good and they use very high quality meats and cheeses. My wife really enjoyed the gluten-free crust as well. I'm looking forward to trying one of their other locations in the future!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is quite good. Nice and thin while still maintaining a filling doughy consistency. It does a decent impression of pizza I've had in Italy. They serve personal sized 12 inch pizzas that are definitely enough to fill you up. They have a great selection as well and allow you to add additional toppings of your choice. 

The rest of the menu is pretty standard fare. It's nothing spectacular but the food is solid. The portioning for all the main courses are a little on the small side though. I've had the lasagna as well as the chicken Cesar salad. They tasted fine but again. A little one the small side and left me craving more food. 

The decor is modern and feels very clean inside. They also offer a sort of half opening kitchen where you can see you pizza being cooked. Not bad overall."}
{"text":"First slice was good, but by the second slice it was soggy.  Service was pretty good though.  Was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"In a city of national chain restaurants and fast food, what a pleasant surprise to find a Pomo in Glendale when we were searching for a late dinner on Labor Day weekend. 

The restaurant is a little difficult to find at first, as it's tucked into the center of the complex. This location has a great patio and bar area, as well as a good amount of seating in the dining room. The salads were huge and fresh, the pizza was perfectly cooked, and my husband practically licked his plate of spaghetti alla carbonara clean. The service was quick and attentive; our server even treated us to shots of limoncello at the end. 

We'll certainly be back when we find ourselves on that side of town again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  We come here every time we get our nails done.   Have tried every pizza and liked all except the one with anchovies.   Waiting for the sister restaurant to reopen this month."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is very nice and the restaurant atmosphere is great. The food was also excellent but the service was unacceptable which is sad.  The server was working so many tables she only came over and checked on us twice. My beverage was empty most of my dinner and I never had the chance to order a second drink. I'll probably give the place a second chance hoping for better service before I don't return again."}
{"text":"We went to Pomo Glendale with a bunch of friends a few weeks back! Absolutely delightful. Service was friendly. One of my top three pizzas and pastas in town!"}
{"text":"Always superior Neapolitan style pizza served with Italian family treatment. Come here a second time and you're like family."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing. Sarah was a great waitress. Kind, friendly and attentive.

But the food... the food... was terrible.
I started off the minestrone soup. Classically a vegetable broth with small pasta throughout. this was literally broth with vegetables. No real flavor or seasoning.

I ordered the bolognese and literally could not stomach more than a few bites. It tasted like dog food served with undercooked (and I like al dente) pasta. 

I was very disappointed with my meal but once again, the service is the only reason I gave any sort of rating."}
{"text":"They closed down Toscana's and left Pomo open.  We will not be back and I was a real fan before. Ordered the gnocchi and it was so soggy from water it was disfiguring we sent it back.  Now they are limited on the menu too. Despite the bad food, when I went to the bathroom, one kitchen staff left without washing her hands after using the bathroom and another kitchen staff was braiding her hair before the shift and didn't wash her hands either!!!  I'm not over exaggerating at all about all of this but our waiter looked like he hadn't showered in days greasy hair dirty uniform.  We paid left and went elsewhere.  Wow! Can't believe it - went downhill over night.  Not worth trying again due to the risk of getting sick from e-coli!  The appearance and the entire bathroom thing with he staff was a definite turn off!! Goodbye Pomo :("}
{"text":"Pomo serves certified neapolitan Italian Pizzas. I had the Bufala Verace Pizza. It was very thin and crispy and even had crispness in the center of the pie. I liked the certified tomatoes on it but they seemed a little thin. My husband had the Torto Sapore. It had an assortment of meats on it and he said it was tasty. I thought the food was overall good but we had multiple problems with the service and felt very unwelcome.
 
When we arrived there was no one in the dining room and were seated at a table for for even though there were many 2 tops in the restaurant.  Our table was actually two 2 tops placed together. As we finished our meal and were waiting for our dessert the hostess picked our box of take home pizza up off of the table we weren't really using and set it on the small table between us. then asked if she could move the table  to create a larger table for 6 next to us.  If the restaurant was crowded this wouldn't be an issue but again we were the only table in the restaurant. There were multiple areas they could have created this larger table and not inconvenienced anyone.  The real problem came when the person brought our dessert. There was no room on the table so his choice was place the dessert on top of the pizza or sit it hanging off of the table. He chose to have it almost falling off the table as you can see in the picture.  The only way we could actually cut into the dessert was to put it on top of the pizza.  To her credit when the server brought our check and aw the predicament she offered to take the pizza box to the kitchen.  We were done so it was irrelevant.  One of the more interesting things was when our dessert was delivered the young man arrived at our table and said did someone order dessert? he then said here is your whatever it is as I don't really know exactly what it is.  we were flabbergasted but just laughed.

 Parking may be difficult. Every spot was taken and half the businesses were closed. I noticed several cars parking in the road in the bike lane on the road that crosses 59th. I've been to the Pomo in Scottsdale and my visit there was excellent. Hopefully this location will get the service issues together.

Food is good worth a try for the food but I had to remove a star for the service."}
{"text":"So we came back to this location and I had to knock one star off.  Usually I wouldn't, but I'm hoping if they see my review (from a long time fan), they will up their game a little.  We dined last weekend and had the unfortunate experience of dining in 104 weather when their ac was broken.  Really it's not a problem but when asked if their was ac the person who brought us our menus actually LAUGHED at us and said very bluntly 'no' then turned and walked away with a smile on his face.  We almost got up and left but we were treating out of town guests to our 'favorite authentic pizza' in the valley so we decided to tough it out.  Thankfully our server for the evening was extremely helpful and pleasant and redeemed my view point of the service at Pomo that particular evening.  He even discounted our tab due to the ac being broken, which was much appreciated.
The only other issue was the pizza didn't taste quite the same as it always has.  The crust was a little soggy towards the center and the pizza was actually kind of cold, the mozzarella was solid and not melty like it usually is. Service was extremely fast which had us thinking the pizzas had been made and sitting there for awhile :( if that's the case, not cool Pomo.  I'm going to give this location another chance because I can't bare to say goodbye.  But I also don't like wasting money so I really hope we just dined on an off night and next time will be better."}
{"text":"Calzones are great, pizza is pretty good, but the meatballs are completely disappointing. I know it's a pizza place.. But as an upper scale one I would expect the meatballs and gravy to be on point! Streets of New York... Even mellow mushrooms are better! What?! So ya, this rating is mostly about my disappointment in the meatballs :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza EVER! I absolutely love it here. We have tried the bruschetta classics, absolutely delicious, fresh ingredients with crusty bread! We also love the fritto misto, very crispy and flavorful, plus you get shrimp and calamari! (just wish you got a bit more) My boyfriend always order the Pomo (sausage, red bell pepper, onions, evoo) and eats the entire thing. I get the Principe (prosciutto, arugula, shaved Parmesan cheese, evoo) absolutely stellar! The crust is crispy and super thin, the sauce is very flavorful, fresh mozzarella, just delicious! I would recommend anyone to go here!"}
{"text":"We went to Pomo for a special tasting of the bistro side food..  Food was wonderful. We will definitely coming back. 
Atmosphere was was fantastic.  The pizza side very modern and Scottsdalish.  The bistro side very bistro. Red and white checkered table clothe, full bar.  Just a really fun place with awesome food.
The owner, Stefano, very friendly.
I think we're going back tonight to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Holy crap...good pizza in northwest Phoenix.     It figures that this place opens just a few months before I leave the state.  We've been a fan of Pomo every since we tried them at their downtown location, and I've been anxiously waiting for Pomo to open ever since my girlfriend told me they were adding a location here.  Pomo is only the second pizza place in Phoenix (that I've seen) that serves authentic certified Neapolitan style pizza.  That means the dough is crispy on the outside and a bit wet on the inside. Absolutely delightful.  We got the parmigiana pizza and the carbonara pizza. Both were exceptional.  The eggplant was perfectly fried and the balance between the cheese and sauce and meat was perfect. The egg on the carbonara made it taste like a very delicate quiche.  But not all good stories can be perfect. While the pizza was exceptional and I love the ambiance of the restaurant, the appetizers left a little to be desired. The fried calamari and shrimp was decent but overpriced, and the Caesar salad was just \"meh.\"  They have a nice beer selection, but the wine selection could stand to be expanded a little bit.  All that ending said, no one goes to a pizzeria for the Caesar salad.  Come for the pizza, and you won't regret your decision. It makes me happy that we're getting good, non-chain restaurants on this side of the valley, and it's clear that I'm not the only one with this sentiment because this place was packed."}
{"text":"Service was very slow, had to flag someone down for service. Food was mediocre.  Note, don't put children's desserts in a martini glass, they can't reach it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, reasonably priced! All of their food is freshly made in house!
Every time I visit Arizona I have to have dinner here!"}
{"text":"There are not many great places in the northwest valley to eat. Pomo is definitely one of the best places around. Service is great and the food is excellent. Pizzas have a great crust and the sauce has good flavor. We usually eat on the casual side of the restaurant. The next review will be on the traditional sit down side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, friendly service and a great atmosphere. My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner that included delicious drinks, a fresh salad, pizza and desert with coffee. We enjoyed dining on the patio then moved to the bar inside when it cooled off. We wouldn't hesitate recommending this place to others!"}
{"text":"I took my younger brother here for lunch on his graduation day- and we enjoyed it. I would give it a solid 3.5 out of 5. The pizza was good, but I felt like it lacked something, but was unable to figure out what that was. It's a little pricy, and two people can easily share 1 pizza. Creme Brulee for desert was heavenly. Will be trying it at least 1 more time!"}
{"text":"Heard it through the grapevine that this was the place to go for primo pizza, service, and atmosphere. Not so. As we entered the pretentious Pomo on a 114 degree afternoon in Arizona the hostess asked us would we like to sit inside or out. Were we dressed in bathing attire? No. We were then seated at a very small table for two. Comfortable? Not even close.
Perhaps the waiter would make up for the first 2 strikes. Oh no, strike 3! Menus covered up the tiny table with no room for water, let alone libations that they did not have available. Certainly the pizza would be worth the dissapointments thus far. My positive persona was rapidly disintegrating when the waiter told us they could not separate the vegetables from the meat on any order, not even for an extra charge. He suggested these were small enough that we should consider one 12in. pizza per person at 15.00 ea. Nice try! Thankfully my son asked how many slices on a 12 in. The waiter replied 7. At 115 lbs, I can barely eat two!! We settled on one and would have to remove what we could not tolerate. Thank you so much:(  The pizza was presented within 5 minutes, hot but horrible with a flaky burnt crust and a $28.00 bill. Voila! If you try hard enough you can swallow it with the help of the table oil. Had it not been my son's birthday I would have definitely requested a refund."}
{"text":"I am not sure why or how my review is gone.  But I have been to the Glendale location several times.  I love the pizza and dessert!  My favorites:  MARGHERITA & POMO.  The pizzas are thin, light, and slightly crispy crust.   The flour-less chocolate cake is yummy!  The service there is always very friend.  No leftovers!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb...awsome service. ..people are super friendly and nice...highly recommended"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our order was messed up twice. Noise level is extremely loud so hopefully you don't enjoy talking while eating here."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for some real pizza and we were not disappointed.  Perfect crust wonderful toppings.  We also had the antipasto which was abundant and dressed to perfection with a red wine vinaigrette .  We haven't tried the pasta but what we saw being served looked and smelled wonderful .  We plan to go back and try the pasta.  It's a small place and the kitchen is right on the side so you can see how they prepare the food.  Very simple decor nothing  fancy here but the food and service is outstanding"}
{"text":"First time coming here. The menu is confusing, unless you speak Italian you'll be asking what some things are. It's very expensive for what you get. (The size of say a papa johns that's a small was 20.00) Think of it more as a very nice place to do dinner, but you don't have to dress up. The pizza I received was not what I ordered. ..luckily we caught it before we got all the way home. They put a new one in right away and apologized. The pizza itself isn't that spectacular for the price/size. This place is entirely for the feel/atmosphere. The staff was friendly and helpful...I think they need to revamp the menu and drive down price if they want to stay open."}
{"text":"Oven baked meat lovers pizza. Thin crusted with wonderful seasoning and aroma to salivate for.  This Glendale branch is an honorable mention compared to  the original Pomo in downtown. Too many memories created at the downtown Pomo to part from the original."}
{"text":"Went here again last night which now makes about seven times in a month since finding it. Have to say I can't stop thinking about the food here. Several pizzas, the lasagna, the paninis, etc. The food here is special. You owe it to yourself to have a pizza here."}
{"text":"Expensive the food was not worth the price.
It's marketed as an upscale Italian pizzeria but the food was not that upscale. First off good luck figuring out the menu (basically in Italian), second off the appetizers tasted all the same fried potato and cheese like and the salad greens had no dressing, thirdly my bruschetta variety platter also tasted all the same. The drink I got was too strong and gross for what I paid. It wasn't great but not terrible meh."}
{"text":"Four of us came to this Italian pizzeria after learning they had opened a location in this part of the Valley. From the outside looking in, the new, modern décor included patio dining, large brick oven, bar area, and dim lit interior. The décor rendered a sense of formality, but the crowd was all-inclusive, and group and family-friendly. 

Their pizzas are cerfied by the V.P.N. Verace Pizza Napoletana and the A.P.N. Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani of Napoli, and each pizza is freshly made from their brick oven in 60-90 seconds. We initially ordered two pizzas, but the dinner went so well we had to order a third. 

The Toto Sapore ($15.95) came with Italian sausage, bacon, spicy salami, and ham. The mix of toppings was delicious and evenly spread. The crust was flavorful, crispy, and firm with a few soft spots, and the tomato sauce was refined and out of this world. The taste was not as heavy as it appeared. We really enjoyed it.

The Quattro Stagnioni ($13.95) came with Italian sausage, olives, salami, and mushroom. The balance of meat with olives and mushrooms provided some depth and complexities, with the delicious salami holding it down as the anchor. Again, the crust and tomato sauce were made to perfection. Light, airy, and not greasy was the way I would describe it. 

The Regina Margherita ($11.95) was very good, but not my favorite out of the three. The flavors of the certified tomato, mozzarella, parmesan, basil, and olive oil were spot on. However, the overall flavors and the lack of basil made it one-dimensional comparing to the meatier ones. 

We also ordered an Eggplant appetizer that didn't make it to our table. We inquired about it several times, but apparently the chef had forgotten about it. The owner of the restaurant was very gracious to serve the appetizer in person, and gave it to us on the house after apologizing profusely. With presentation and textures of lasagna, the layers of eggplant were baked to perfection that nicely intermingled with the light cheese and tomato sauce. Even though we were already full, but had to indulge further after learning how delicious it was. The owner also sat with us and chatted for a while. It was a nice touch to add to this memorable meal.

Aside from the mishap in the kitchen, the server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. She had a good grasp of the menu and our water was constantly refilled. It was a sensational meal where process, product, and experience met our expectations. They also opened a restaurant called Toscana next door that serves dishes from the region of Emilia Romagna. Santi and I will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviews in regards to the menu. Just because you are eating Italian does not mean you can read it. The menu is very confusing in regards to a mix of English and Italian words. We shared an appetizer, a pizza and a pasta dish to try it all. Service was very good. Our waiter was always near and our needs were met. Food quality was just ok. Pizza lacked the punch we expected and the pasta dish was average. This was our first visit so I remain generic in my review. Always give a place a second shot. Hopefully the second visit will be better."}
{"text":"The location had excellent service and the tuna salad at lunch was delicious. My favorite location is downtown Phoenix, but in a pinch Glendale and Scottsdale that come through."}
{"text":"There aren't many places that can use the word authentic. Pomo can. The server was knowledgeable. The food was delicious. We had the pizzas. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"What's this? Good pizza in the Northwest Valley, you say? In an area that's embarrassingly overloaded with local and national pizza chains, I was quite excited when discovering that Pomo Pizzeria quietly opened up a location just several miles from my house. And with good reason. Having become quite familiar with Pomo's downtown location, as well as a side-stop at their Scottsdale establishment, I knew this would be a welcoming addition to an area that isn't exactly renowned for its prime dining.

In some ways, I was sincerely hoping this Glendale location would eliminate the need to have to travel downtown to get my Pomo fix. And while that's definitely true to some extent, there's a little something missing. Actually, a few things, which I'll get to in a moment.

Make no mistake, the pizzas here are superb, providing a similar, although not quite duplicate experience of the other Pomo locations. Now, bear in mind, if you're accustomed to Americanized pizza that you can get at any cookie cutter chain or sports bar in the area, then this pizza may throw you off. Hell, the menu itself can be rather intimidating. But approach things with an open mind and you'll quickly realize what you've been missing.

Their bread with olive oil is always a good way to start off. For pizzas, they offer a basic Regina Margherita for those that want to play it safe. However, I strongly suggest the Bufala Verace, which is essentially the same thing, only with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo cheese) in place of the usual parmigianno regiano. Pomo also has a big hit with their Principe, which is a delightfully simple combination of priscuitto, parmigianno regiano, and arugula. There are many other options, but none seem to have any dramatic differences other than a few ingredients.

Ah, but it's not all about pizzas at Pomo. While few people seem to be aware, this place also offers some of the best calzones you can find. And while the traditional Calzone Napoletano might be a safe choice, it's their fried calzones that I consider to be their true menu gem. The Pizza Fritta is worth a shot, but lacks core ingredients aside from cheese. The Vesuvia is your best bet, due to its addition of prosciutto and spicy salame. We order it every time with zero hesitation.

The homemade desserts are all very good, but not great. The torta nutella, tiramisu, and affogato al caffe are worth trying. Nothing here is mind-blowing in comparison to what I've had at other places, but that doesn't stop me from recommending them.

So, what stops me from giving this place a perfect five stars? Well, the service still needs some work. Soda refills seem to only come by request, even on dead evenings. On one memorable occasion, we were served a completely botched affogato al caffe that was completely missing the gelato scoops. It was essentially a glass of cold, coffee-flavored soup! I'm not sure what's more unsettling, the fact that this made it out of the kitchen or the fact that the server was able to deliver it while maintaining a completely straight face. Sorry, but eight dollar desserts shouldn't leave room for error.  

There's also some little charms at the downtown location that are conspicuously absent from Glendale, such as having a plate of complimentary fried dough and limoncello shots automatically served to you after your meal. I guess we've become spoiled. If you read the downtown reviews, you'll see that little things like this are what make Pomo so highly acclaimed and I see no reason why this can't be carried over. 

With that said, the pizza is still excellent and easily competes with some of the best that the city has to offer. And for an area that is completely void of Neapolitan Pizza, I consider it a welcome addition!

Now, if only Master Chef Matteo would bring us some of those limoncello shots, we'd be all smiles!"}
{"text":"If you're in or around north Glendale and want fresh and authentic Italian food, great service at a reasonable price, come to Pomo. The menu is diverse and well conceived. From the antipasto to the dolce and everything in between, everything is fresh and well prepared. Pizzas are the traditional thin crust style. Pastas are so good I can only presume they are freshly hand made in the kitchen. 
I really love their lunch menu too. The serve a couple of pasta dishes and 5 different panini sandwiches. I had the Amalfi today. Grilled zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms and tomato on delicious homemade bread. 
Love this place."}
{"text":"Finally, a taste of the Northeast in the West Valley. Enjoyed my Giotti cocktail, gnocchi and panne cotta. Slight ding for parmesan out of the shaker instead of freshly grated parmesan. So happy to actually enjoy a meal on the Westside!"}
{"text":"Pomo pizza is the best pizza I've tasted in a long while.  We went there for lunch today and ordered the Principe pizza, along with the bruschetta trio for an appetizer and shared a creme brulee for dessert.  Everything was excellent.  The pizza is probably the best I've tasted here in the northwest valley. The crust was just right - chewy and a bit charred.  We will definitely be back to try more dishes.  I must mention that our server was also excellent - she was knowledgable and made the right suggestions.  We left satisfied but not overly stuffed.  This will def be a new fave!
I will say that we first parked in the far north parking lot, and saw the door for Pomo, opened it, and ended up in the kitchen.  We then went around front, and entered the restaurant, but got a bit confused as all of the olive oils, cheeses, bagged pasta, etc. was in the entrance...it's a bit confusing but thankfully we were in the right place :-)"}
{"text":"So everyone knows I'm critical of Food! Especially Italian! 
Our appetizer grilled veggies and the bread app were terrible! Sorry but it is what it is. Now the Margarita pizza that was worth writing home about! :) the dessert menu looked amazing I'm not a tiramisu fan but this was a wonderful delight! Good Italian wine list! We had the Dogagolo  amazing wine ! I know they will do well here but you should revisit your appetizer menu! Our server was sweet but very green I appreciate  
Honesty so we still left 20%! Good employees are hard to find take time and invest in their training that way it is a win win situation for all! People in the industry are very forgiving we notice our surroundings and make consideration for all situations ! Good job you can aim to be better and we will be BACK!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. No idea what the name was but it has mushrooms, olives (not the black olives), and some tasty meat. Sauce is fresh and the crust was cooked just right. There wasn't a wait and meter parking was easy enough. Made for a nice night out :)"}
{"text":"So happy Pomo came to the west side! Well north west.lol. But it's within biking distance to my house so of course I'm going to give it 5 stars!!

Already been here twice and both time the Neapolitan pizza was amazing. Came out quick, hot and fresh. Perfect crust and perfect toppings. I really enjoyed my pizzas. Too bad I can't pronounce the names of the pizza.lol. But we had the one with the most meat on it. 

I want to try different pizzas and their calzone and now there is an Italian bistro next door as well. Looks like my area is finally catching on!

Overall Promo is the place to get quality Neapolitian pizzas anywhere west of the 17. It's about time local restraint chains come over here. I'll keep coming back for the quality of food as well as the convince. They are also open till 11pm on the weekends so it's a great late night bite as well!"}
{"text":"Just reopened and remodeled, they have an outdoor section of the bar that is very nice. I tried an eggplant appetizer with a gin martini for a quick lunch that was wonderful. Friendly bartender provided great service and food."}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point.

-watered down margarita (not worth $10).
-$2 charge for a very small loaf of bread. (What Italian restaurant charges for bread?!)
-Overpriced food for small portion sizes and just ok taste.
-server prioritized larger table.
 
Not what we expected based off of some of the reviews. We definitely won't go here again. You be the judge, but don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"We definitely will be back. Great food and atmosphere. Been looking for a place like this."}
{"text":"Average service, but AMAZING FOOD! We tried 3 pizzas, which were all outstanding and their desserts were so authentic. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This pizza place is located in a shopping plaza near Utopia and N 59th Ave in Glendale, AZ.  Parking on a Friday night can be tough, but we found a spot on the other side of Chase Bank.  The atmosphere inside is dimly lit in a romantic way.  We are huge fans of margherita pizza and we test every pizza restaurant in town to judge them against the best.  I compare most places to Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix as well as My Pie.  The evo sauce here did not disappoint.  The fresh basil on the pizza really brought it home.  The cheese was okay too, but there were a few spots where it was perfectly thin and some spots were a little thick.  I prefer a thin layer of cheese so that the sauce can speak for itself.  Most of the pizza is a nice thin crust with the end being slightly thicker.  I wondered why we were brought olive oil (one plain and one with nice spices at the bottom).  We poured out the spicy looking olive oil (it had a little spice flavor to it, very subtle though) and started dipping our crust in it.  Perfect.

If you're really hungry, you can probably finish a pizza yourself.  Next time we come here, we'll probably share a pizza instead of getting two."}
{"text":"This place is so good. My friends and I split the Romana salad and Peppino pizza, so delicious! We tried their trio bruschetta last time which was also yummy. Pomo has a nice atmosphere and is inexpensive when sharing with friends."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a new \"Place\" for pizza since ours closed and I think we've found it.  Only been once, but will go back for sure.  We had the Margharita and the Pomo pizzas and they were both wonderful. The Mango Salad was very good and big enough for three small servings (just enough if you're having something else).  Loved the thin, but not overly crispy crust on the pizzas and the seasoning was right on.  Pizza was big enough for two peeps to have three very generous pieces apiece.  Would love to go back and try something off the regular menu, but I'm not sure I could stay away from the pizza. Our server was wonderful.  Very helpful, there when we needed her, but not hovering.  Down side?  True, it was Saturday night, but really, really noisy.  Regular conversation was difficult."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Arizona!!!! To be a certified Neapolitan Pizzeria the restaurant has to use authentic ingredients all the way down to the flour. The quality of the ingredients can be tasted in the absolutely delicious pizza at this place. I have been back once a week since it opened and have tried several of their pizzas and have not been disappointed! I do need to say that the pastas have not won me over, pizza is definitely the food to eat at Pomo."}
{"text":"We have long been fans of Pomo and were very excited for them to open one on the west side.   However after three attempts to love the new location, we just can't seem to get there.  .  The pizzas are always wonderful but the other menu items seem to lack the same care.  But more importantly the staff seems disinterested and disengaged with the guests.   From the moment you walk in until you leave, they all seem like they have something else they'd rather be doing.  Overall, the new location lacks the warmth and charm of the others.  Really hope they will get there groove on and make this as good as the original."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! The meatballs were the best I've ever tasted! The staff was helpful and informative. The entree was as authentic as it gets. The freshness of the ingredients is evident and the prices are reasonable. Giancarlo and the pizza makers made our experience fun and welcoming. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Friday night is usually crazy but this was nice.  We are in the Toscana side which is more fine dining.  Loved the portion size, each person needed their own salad.  Entrees were good- salmon excellent, lemon herb chicken a little dry.  They offered to make another but I declined.  The Limoncello Truffle was heavenly.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"So glad POMO opened way out here in the West Valley.  We really needed this. Went for the first time last night and everything was great.  The place was packed for a Thursday night.  The hostess was pleasant.  We had a great waiter and when we were leaving one of the managers asked how they were doing.  Well ... they did just fine.  Loved the decor, the pizzas were awesome, wine was very good.  Next time I want to eat outside.  Cool vibe with the blue lights in the trees.  Welcome to the neighborhood POMO.  I'll be back soon.  You are my new best friend."}
{"text":"Everything is excellent at Pomo! Friendly staff and superior food. Nice setting. Amazing food and wine choices. It is a genuine taste of Italy in Arizona! The Pizzas are truly delicious. The carpaccio is sublime!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza! Make sure to read the menu for a description of what the crust will be like or you maybe surprised. Service was solid, server very knowledgeable. Sat outside. Comfortable, but a bit noisy."}
{"text":"If you came here looking for Pomo Glendale, no need to worry it's been replaced by a NEW and improved concept, Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante.  Check it out at bottegaristorante.com"}
{"text":"My son made a reservation here for me and his mother for valentines day. The server was rude and suggested if I wasn't interested in beef another restaurant maybe the way to go. Once the pizzas came out they were cold so the server took those pizzas and put them back in the over and burnt them. Server didn't refill our water nor soda  as we left they asked how everything was my wife mentioned the bad service and cold food and the lady said sorry have a nice night. My son spoke great in regards to this restaurant and was shocked that this happened. I don't see us ever going back to a restaurant that can't apologize not try and make up for ruining someone's night."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful the food was yummy and it's a lovely atmosphere! The restaurant is beautiful and has an awesome patio with an indoor/outdoor bar. Really cool setup. Highly recommend the lasagna and creme brulee. Will be back asap!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great here, bruschetta was good as well. Nice environment friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they open a Pomo near my salon. Yayyyy, happy hour after work. Haha jk. I usually go to the down town one. This one is quite bigger and more alive. The ambiance is so relaxing and the pizza here is phenomenal. Any vegetarian pizza here is phenomenal. Haha :D"}
{"text":"Pomo opened a place semi close to my house?  West side!  Hell yeah!

I had been to the downtown location once before and thought it was pretty damn delicious (top 5 pizzas in Phoenix...for sure..without a doubt).  I had been meaning to go back,  but life (work, kid, too far, diet etc) gets in the way.  Today I had some free time and decided to check out the new Pomo in Glendale.  

I found some parking and walked over.  The building is nice!  They have a nice sized outside patio/bar and then some tables inside.  I chose to sit inside and ordered a water to drink.  I studied the menu for a bit...about that....  I had looked online and had noticed that they have 2 different menus (Phoenix and Scottsdale).  The Phoenix menu had a pizza that had pancetta, onions and black pepper on it called the Amatriciana.  The Scottsdale menu did not have that pizza.  I was craving that particular pizza since I woke up this morning.  Turns out, the Glendale one did not have that particular pizza (amatriciana) either :-(.  I had to go with something else.  I decided on the Diavola.  It is mozzarella, spicy salame and basil.  I placed my order for that, chilled for about 5 minutes and then my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was..............


Diavola- ($13.95)  It looked fantastic!  It had just enough pieces of salame on it, a couple of leaves of basil and then a decent amount of cheese.  A few things about this pizza.  A.)  The \"spicy\" salame was not too spicy.  It tasted great though!  B.)  I'm usually not the biggest fan of basil on my pizza, but this basil was so tender and delicious and not overpowering.  I loved it!  It worked well with all the other flavors.  C.)  Pomo uses the creamiest mozzarella I have ever had.  In my previous review of the downtown location, I mentioned the same thing.  I don't know where they get this magical cheese from, but it sure is delicious!  It's rich, creamy, salty....just flat out excellent!  My favorite cheese of any pizza in Phoenix!  All of these items were layered perfectly on top of their simple yet delicious tomato sauce.  It is all held together by their excellent crust!  It was perfectly charred but not burnt.  It had a great chew to it.  It was pretty much a perfect pizza.  Can't get much better.

Service was alright.  Not great, not bad, just ok.  I will definitely be back to try out some of their other pizzas!  My stomach was very impressed ;-)"}
{"text":"We used to be a huge fan of Tutti Santi's before it went out of business, so we decided to try Pomos Pizzeria since they are now located there.  We walked in and no one was around. We actually thought maybe they were closed.   Someone from the kitchen finally walked by and we asked if they were open and then they went and found someone to seat us.  We got menus and water (which tasted like tap water--terrible).  A waiter eventually came and took our order.  The mango salad was just \"ok\".  The mango was so green (under-ripe) that it did not have a lot of flavor.  Our pizzas finally came.  Very disappointing.  They were black charred on the bottom, so much so that it took over the entire flavor of the pizza.  Even with a lot of red chili flakes.  The waiter again finally returned and asked how things were and I mentioned that the  pizza was burned.  He said he would have them make a new one.  It was marginally better.  But he said the manager was going to take it off the bill, which was the right thing to do.  This just wasn't the kind of pizza we were hoping for, the crust was paper thin, the sauce was boring like tomato sauce, and it was burned.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Your voicemail says you close at 10pm and so does Yelp. I turned up at 945pm to buy a gift card for $150. Sucks for you..I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has some of the bet Italian food I have ever had. I typically just a restaurant by there spaghetti and meat sauce. This place exceeded my expectations by a land side. The food is so fresh. I have been here multiple time and will continue to go. If you are looking for quality fresh Italian food then this is the place to go. The server and bartenders were very friendly. I would recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and fast. Love this place. The Toto Sapore pizza is our favorite and the profiteroles are a must try."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, it's neat decor & ambiance. Pretty great food, service and overall dining experience. Luv the thin crust on all their pizzas, you can tell they use fine quality & fresh ingredients. The only reason I can't give it a five star rating is because I'm a piggy, I do like larger portions, my husband & I ate everything on our plates and each had desert as well. And we were both of the opinion that we could've used more food. I think we will for sure order appetizer before the meal next time"}
{"text":"Between their pizzas and desserts, wow! Service was just ok. She wasn't very knowledgeable of the menu. We started with the bruschetta. Disappointed in serving size, as there was only two slices of bread served. But, the taste and flavor was spot on. We had three different pizzas, and they were outstanding. Flavor was perfect and had such fresh ingredients. The crust was absolutely delectable too. It honestly tasted like it was straight from the streets of Italy. Our dessert was even better. Chocolate mousse covering decadent cream puffs. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
