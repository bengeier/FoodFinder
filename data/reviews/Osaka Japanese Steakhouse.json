{"text":"Two stars here. Restaurant is nicely kept, environment is good i like how the teppanyaki area is separate of the dining area. the food though, i was disappointed. Calamari you only get a few bites, jalape√±o poppers were not spicy at all and had way too much spicy tuna in it as well as the rolls that we got. we ordered the vegas rolls and the rockstar rolls. both were nothing but the tuna and salmon it seemed. seems like the food can be better made. not sure that i would eat here again."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour and it was slow.  Had a lot of staff but they were all eating and talking with one another. The service was terrible.  Seemed like they had no management or even cared. The food was good and once were helped food came out fairly quickly.  Took so long to get service but they had so many help doing nothing and having a good time. We would have ordered more but no one would take an order.   I would not go again cause of the service. If you want an easy job and free food I would try and get a job there"}
{"text":"Just visit the restaurant today for the first time .Very pleasant experience. Love the food and atmosphere. Drinks are great! All around an amazing sushi restaurant . I will recommend  dinner for two  to  every one . Sam , our chef and Ashley, our waitress  are awesome . Tank you very much Osaka staff !"}
{"text":"Great food but we sat in the bar and the two young gentleman behind the bar spent more time playing around than refilling our drinks or taking our order. We ended up going elsewhere for more drinks. But the food was AMAZING"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service today. We had to ask for everything, napkins, silverware,  chop sticks, soy sauce. It was unbelievable. We got our food, I had hair in my wasabi, my husband got something that he didn't even order. The manager sat at the bar doing his hand receipt tickets and heard our complaints but did nothing about it. They did nothing to compensate us for everything that was wrong. We really used to like going there but won't go back."}
{"text":"Date night with the husband was great! We can't get enough of this place! The food is always amazing (we highly suggest the poke tuna) and the service is above and beyond. Lance and David are always on top of it and are great to talk with!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch for the first time today. Great service, great teppanyaki food! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town! Portions are great, quality of food, and service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place does not understand the concept of reservations. Got a babysitter for a date night showed up Friday for our 630pm reservation and it was busy so about 7 I checked in at the desk and was interrupted by the manager Sky before I could ask the status of our table and said they were really busy and were going to get us seated soon. Went to the bar for a drink. 20 minutes later I checked again and the girl said they were working to get us seated, so by this time it's almost 1.5 hours after our reservation so we left.   Don't waste your time making a reservation as they do not matter."}
{"text":"If you are in Mesa, AZ and looking for a good Japanese steakhouse and sushi place, this is it! We took my daughter her for her 4th birthday and she loved it! They make a really big deal out of birthdays! The chef was so much fun, interactive, great table side manor, lots of jokes and very entertaining. There is a good sushi menu for those that do not want grill made food. I will definitely visit this restaurant again. Good for groups. It is a bit loud and festive so if your looking for a quite romantic experience, you may try the sushi bar side. Probably not a good location for business meetings (noise level) unless you are looking for a fun, entertaining business lunch like an office party or office birthday/ milestone celebration."}
{"text":"Traditional sushi menu. Nice place inside."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on fourth of July. Pre-fireworks meal. We eat here all the time since it first opened but this is my first review of the restaurant.  The teppenyaki side is lame and the sashimi is yuck but....... hands down best specialty rolls on the west side. Service is always great!!! My toddler wanted a milkshake that wasn't on the menu and our server talked the bartender in making her one!!! AWESOME!!! Thanks for going above the bar for her. We brought in some food with us, as i wasnt sure she would try anything. Our server just looked the other way. He  gave her some \"cheater\" chop sticks and she didn't look back. Squid salad, rolls,  she was in. :) had a great time as always!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, atmosphere and food. Will definitely be eating here again. Everything was well priced and all three of us walked out of the restaurant in food comas, the food was just amazing!"}
{"text":"1st timer.....and my girlfriend's top choice  Well lemme say not big on this but........... This place is probably my favorite eating choice outside of my own cooking ...the environment service and quality were pretty damn Great...our server was Jason...excellent job in our service ..our cook was Kevin and friendly quality food absolutely  delicious  to me and my girlfriend's taste of ....all around I and my girlfriend are very happy with everything I must say anyone around the area must try this place !!!!!!! WE ARE THE DINNER FOR 2 n we will be back for more and more as long as this experience for this time continues or improves...keep it up your guys ...and thank you for our excellent food service...5 stars  and more ...very very very satisfied  ...recommendations all the way ..keep it up !!! :)  P.s. participate and tip ...100% enjoyment  ... And again thank You!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok let me explain why I give this place 2 stars. Where do I start...... We sat at the bar and and the bartender was good came to get our drink order right away.  Now we didn't realize that the other bartender which looks and acts like a teenager was trying to get out of the dog house from his girlfriend because the whole time we were there he was trying to please her. It was annoying and distracting from my dinner. Now enough talking about the staff lets get to the good stuff or the lack of. We started with the tempura combo which was ok. It only had 2 shrimp and 4 pieces of random vegetable for $5. Then the sushi. We got the spicy tuna nigiri which look really weird, it looked like it had red food coloring and was really unappealing. Then the tuna nigiri and it needed the red food coloring because it was brown and looked old. Worried about getting sick I passed on that. We ordered another beer and there was no cold glass so I liked that \"good\" bartender actually got a glass iced it down and gave it to us. That is why I gave a extra star.  Now I had to laugh when I was paying my bill the \"kid\" asked if I wanted change from a $51tab when paying with a $100. Now I still left a good tip cause the other bartender actually was working. Would I go back?   Hmmmmm no thanks I've eaten way better sushi somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came in on a late Saturday afternoon. The hostess asked if we had reservations for hibachi (which we didn't) but sat us anyway. Our server came quickly for our drink orders. We ordered vodka and cranberry that I thought was a bit watered. Once she took our food orders she brought out the miso soup, which was great and not too salty. The salad was small but the ginger dressing was not overwhelming like I have experienced before. Our chef arrived and the fun began. He was entertaining, although we had a couple of prudes at our table who wouldn't do the shrimp toss or sake squirt. The food was delicious. I had the salmon and my husband had steak and chicken. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly how we requested. The portion sizes were more than enough.   This is a fun date night place if you go for hibachi. I also noticed a bar, tv, and typical dining area. Our server was nice enough but did not seem to be overly excited to be there. Overall, this is our new favorite Japanese spot. Next time I will order sushi."}
{"text":"I'm here as we speak the manager had great customer service and even gave us cold Saki for me, however he forgot to mention that they don't have enough staff and it took over an hour to get an order of las Vegas rolls. I was starving now I'm disgusted"}
{"text":"This is a a fantastic traditional sushi food place with all the fixings. Great bartender Alex and great food from teppanyaki to sushi, all fantastic."}
{"text":"A big group of us ate here the other night.   I ordered sushi rolls and sashimi and it was amazing.  The pricing was good too!  Everyone seemed happy with the hibachi grill but it took them way too long to get the cook over.  I was done with my meal before the cook even came around, poor planning which is the only reason why I gave this 4 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I can't get enough of this place. We're big on sushi and in the 9 years we've been on sushi dates (between Jersey and Arizona), this by far is the best sushi we've ever had, hands down. Everything is so fresh and their portions are great, unlike a lot of other sushi places who give you little sushi rolls for the same price. We haven't tried anything else on the menu besides the sushi (yet). We like to finish off our meal with the tempura red bean or green tea ice cream. So so good! Staff is always friendly and the place is always clean. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Sushi lunch at the bar.  Fairly priced and very fresh and professionally presented. Staff was all very friendly and quick.  I would definitely come back again, especially for dinner, a lot of the larger meals and sushi rolls looked very good."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Dinner was at the teppan which was great! I was with a large group (8 people total) and we were taken care of very well.  The lunch another time was similar. For that we sat at the regular tables by choice. Just gotta note that the host guy for that day was very strange as he kept hovering around and staring at people as they ate. This was on a Saturday around 2."}
{"text":"excellent japanese steak house. great service with fresh food. they really take care of their customers. highly recommended! mesa's hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"This was literally the worst sushi I have EVER been served and I've had supermarket sushi.  Let's start with the our waiter.  He had zero personality and was difficult to understand.  This had nothing to do with a language barrier and everything to do with him not having enough enthusiasm to even open his mouth wide enough to speak.  He barely knew the menu and even worse, he didn't know/or could not identify the items we ordered.  We had to explain to him several times, that we had not been served what we ordered.  They used minced imitation crab that was a ridiculous color pink I had never seen before.  We had to chew our rolls forever just to get them down, I spit several out after deciding it wasn't worth the effort to keep chewing.  Good sushi practically melts in your mouth.  After we finally convinced him that a salmon roll wasn't a spicy tuna roll, he deliver the strangest looking tuna roll I had ever seen.  I quickly regretted being the brave one at the table to try it and immediately spit it out.  My friend offered to try it just to make sure my taste buds weren't off and she to spit it out.  The rolls were dry, the fish had no flavor (imitation/cheap cuts) and the waiter was terrible.  On the positive I did like the cucumber salad and the happy hour drinks were fab!  Unfortunately I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"We Love this place. We go for sushi about once a week and teppynaki occasionally.  The food and service are always excellent. Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"I could not rave more about this place. Great, awesome, well done.  There was five of us including my 7 and 9 year old nieces. Everybody enjoyed everything. The girls enjoyed the \"show\" and everybody thought the food was over the top.  You can't go wrong with anything you order but one item deserves special mention. Order the Osaka Sushi Roll. Omg!  FYI, kids eat free on Sunday nights. It was yet another pleasant surprise. Great job by the entire staff!!"}
{"text":"The food was splendid and fairly inexpensive for a good restaurant. Wow!!! This place showed me what eating out was all about: great ambiance, amazing server, first class food.  I ordered their squid salad and it came out in a huge bowl which the server gave me a heads up but forgot to mention how delicious it was which was great. I proceeded with a bowl of fried ice-cream desert and it just made my day complete."}
{"text":"Great spot for awesome food and drinks. Dinner salad is big enough for two with a couple of sushi rolls! Makes for a wonderful date night. .. Without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The food is great... but beware they will charge a pretty penny (25% gratuity) for a party of 6 or more. And they wouldn't recognize my birthday coupon that was completely valid."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out with the kids. We all enjoyed ourselves. The food was good and the chef was fun and engaging. Service was ok. Would go back for the noodles and sushi for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times already since they've opened, I believe in June or July. At first I was skeptical about the place, they seemed a tad unorganized (but every starting business is) their lunch menu isn't too bad, they have THREE sushi rolls for only $10! ( although there is a list for you to choose from) the sushi here isn't too bad, but yet I haven't tried anything too fancy. The only time I had lunch here it wasn't too busy, I was taken care of pretty well by Vivi, although I did need to ask her to fill up my glass a few times.  The next couple of times I've came, were all weekends. HECTIC!! I went there Friday night and they were slammed!! Good thing my party did make a reservation ahead of time! ( highly recommended ) even though we did have to wait a few minutes to be seated, it was definitely better than the hour wait that some people had. There was a huge crowd in front of the door and it was pretty hard to spot the hostesses to check in, but it eventually happened. Tiffany, which seemed to be the only hostess, was very accommodating and helpful and sat us fairly quick. As we were seated, we were greeted within 2-3 minutes by our wonderful server Kathy. I ordered the Ocrean Trio, which included lobster tail, scallops and shrimp for $36 and it also came with soup and salad, fried rice, veggies and two pcs of shrimp! I say that's a great deal! Our teppan chef David was very funny and entertaining and cooked everything to order. Our server Kathy was excellent! She was very good with refilling drinks, there were times that I didn't even know she took my glass to refill it, I never had a half empty glass! Even though she was slammed with other tables across the room, she always came and checked on us with a smile.   Restaurant itself is very well decorated, bathrooms were tidy, you can choose to sit in regular dining or teppan side. Atmosphere is great eventhough it's a tad crowded on weekends, but that's what makes it fun!  Thanks, Tony!!  I definitely will continue coming, I hope this great place will last in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a review for the food but I never got that far.   Came in, was immediately seated and handed the menu. 20 minutes later still no waiter, no acknowledgment from any of the servers or anyone that works there. So we decided to leave, I'm all for being patient but  20 minutes with no acknowledgement REALLY?! Sorry, we were told happy new year on the way out. Did I mention the place was only at 60% capacity.   Thanks Osaka you really know how to treat your customers."}
{"text":"Great food,  fun and entertainment! We enjoyed all the great food,  the ambiance and the servers were very nice."}
{"text":"I went there when they first opened all the time and I loved it. Giant portions and good food but ever since they got a new Manger they sucked I couldn't believe how crappy the service was, how bad the food was, and the portions were 3x smaller than before. the chicken had absolutely no flavor it tasted like crap. I will never go back there again. I will go to ah so for now on"}
{"text":"Great.addition to the east valley. Bar area need some more additional table seating for more than 2.so we can havens drink waiting for the rest of our party to show up. They could.have made another 100 bucks. Great food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have been coming to this location for a couple years. The cooks are funny and entertaining. I have always had a great experience here. Go during lunch for better prices and less wait time. My boyfriend and I go on sundays and always get seated right away. The filet is amazing and tender every time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in AZ! Super fresh and very reasonably-priced! I go here all the time!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different for sushi and after reading one of the reviews here, decided to give it a try. Sunday happy hour (all day btw) is very good. The sushi was fresh and the portion of protein wrapped is large. Walked out of there after buying two different types of rolls do just over $10 and was fully satisfied at the portion size. This will definitely be my Sunday sushi fix when I need one. Looking forward to trying dinner here also."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, the Teppanyaki experience was a great one. The food was tasty but lil overpriced.."}
{"text":"This place is a great time with good food. My experience has only been with the Teppanyaki tables for dinner but it's always been good. Prices are reasonably priced compared to other Teppanyaki places I've visited (Sapporo, Kobe) and food quality is comparable for the price. The atmosphere and experience is top notch, staff and cooks are very attentive and friendly.  If you're going out for dinner with a group, you won't be disappointed by going here."}
{"text":"The happy hour is awesome! Mango Mai Tai's are excellent. I also really like the Beef Omurice. The happy hour sushi rolls are all great tasting; I always get the Las Vegas roll."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever had.  Waited over an hour for the person to start cooking our food, then they screwed that up too.  People who came in after us get there cooking done before ours was started. There place was all but empty too.  We were half was through our mean when they brought out the soup and salad and say oh\"we for got this\"  After being there 2+ hours we will never be back.... They should get 0 ZERO stars.  They will not be open for long at this rate."}
{"text":"I took my mother here on an early Saturday morning there were only 2 other tables and a man at the bar. We ordered our appetizers 2 miso soups and steamed dumplings. The dumplings came out but no miso soup we brushed it off. My mother ordered her entree a crab salad and I asked for their crunch roll. My mothers salad came out and she finished the entire meal before my sushi was ever brought to the table. When I looked at it I saw there was spicy mayo the menu did not say it came on the roll when I explained this to my waitress she looked at me like a was crazy. She ended up having to get a manager so I can reexplain myself and show her their menu stated masago not spicy mayo. All in all we were disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"The service, food, and the chef were all good.  I'm a tough critic and a picky eater so they must've been good.  I've been here twice already and I will definitely be back.  The second time I brought my parents here when they came to town and they enjoyed it we laughed with other people at the table and that makes the time even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"As Kids Critic, we are kids who love many kinds of food. Osaka here hits the spot! We've been there for dining and tappanyaki. Tappanyaki: Delicious and a fun show. Some of the best i've had. Chicken and rice is AMAZING KIDS! Dinner: I got the chicken dinner box. Yummy yummy. I loved the noodle salad, pot stickers, chicken, and Tempura. The sushi is my favorite out of the dozens of places I've been. Remember: Get the Lisa Lisa Roll. Amazing. :) :) :)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and this time has made me question coming back. Our waitress has come to the table twice which was to take our order and to drop off the food. We asked for no masago on anything and she failed to mention that it is premixed in their crab mix so when I received my California roll I was sadly unable to eat it. We also got the Godzilla roll and the tuna looked repulsive and it was so bad my boyfriend had to spit it out. After waiting about 15 minutes for her to come back I informed her about the Godzilla roll and the California roll she responded \"k give me a minute\". She came back with our check and only removed the California roll which was a bit disappointing as we ended up leaving hungry and paying for a roll that my boyfriend only took half a bite of. When we asked about this she said \"well there was no masago on the Godzilla roll so there's nothing I can do if you didn't like it\" oh okay I mean you can offer me to sub it for a roll the same price so I wasn't just wasting money. Whatever off to somewhere else to eat now lol"}
{"text":"Firstly the service was absolutely terrible. We had a table of seven people and our waitress forgot about us. We had to go up to the bar to get our drinks because she forgot about them and she didn't even deliver our food to us. She took the bill and didn't give us back our change assuming it would be her tip. Secondly, my boyfriend has been throwing up and has had terrible diarrhea for the past 8 hours. We went to the health center and the nurse practitioner concluded that it was definitely food poisoning from the sushi. Two i.v. bags later and some zofran my boyfriend finally stopped throwing up.  Don't go here unless you're looking for terrible service and the shits."}
{"text":"I don't even think a star is fair with this review. Tonight's experience here was absolutely terrible. We ordered 3 rolls the mango tango was decent, Las Vegas was not even edible, and the mama Mia was tasty once it was eaten with a fork because it would fall apart from being wrapped so loosely. The waitress Samantha had horrible service, the issues were brought to her attention and she turnt around mid sentence saying she'd tell the manager. Nothing was resolved tonight left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be coming back to Osaka."}
{"text":"Great food. Sam is an excellent chef and very entertaining! Great customer service! We will be back."}
{"text":"First off, it took around 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order and another 10 for the waiters  to come back with our drinks and take our food order. Bestie and I sat for what seemed like an eternity, I'm sure it was actually about 35 minutes, for our food to come out. I was pretty excited to come here cause I've heard such great things... from start to end we were there for about an hour and a half.  Food was delicious . Needless to say, we won't be going back because the service was really bad."}
{"text":"Great local lunch or dinner spot and excellent food and service always!  Ed T  Mesa Az"}
{"text":"It was a bit of a slow start, but once the food started rolling (pun intended) it was one great hit after another. We sat at the bar where Nate took great care of us. Being that this is a new establishment, I expected there to be some hiccups along the way. But there was very little. To sum it up simply, the food was spot on. The manager/ owner (I assume) was sure to come over and make sure that everything was to our liking. Which I very much appreciated. This was a fun and delicious experience. I highly recommend the yellowtail jalape√±o appetizer. Flavors of all the dishes we tried were balanced, and in my opinion tasted \"decadently expensive\" without the super high dollar price tag that you sometimes expect from good sushi. We also tried the signature \"Osaka roll\" which had a whole lobster tail, crab, eel,  and English cucumber ($20). It was well worth the price. One of the best maki rolls I've had. If you are in the Gilbert area and looking for a fantastic taste of the east, try this restaurant. I will definitely be venturing back when I am in the area. Well done Osaka!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first and it was awesome a little pricey but we didn't hold back either oh we will be back at least a few times a year because it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Good sushi and quick service. Awesome check in deal too with the fried ice cream. Only reason for the 4 stars was the mixed drink. It was a good price through happy hour but pretty sure it was just juice and no alcohol...other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a few times and with each visit the quality of the food has continued to decline. At my last visit the rice that came with the sashimi bento box was mushy and had an odd metal taste to it. The green tea was not brewed, but rather served in a leaky kettle with a bag. The service is great but the food is disappointing."}
{"text":"Come here often! Citrus Roll and Texas Roll are my favs!!!! Sad they didn't have fresh wasabi this time though.  I'm a little concerned that they never seem busy when I'm here. This building has had a lot of restaurants come and go, I hope they last. :)"}
{"text":"Every year since Osaka opened we've been going there for our birthday dinner.  On a few occasions we've also celebrated our adult children's birthdays there.  On cue the servers drum to the beat of the traditional Japanese birthday song and bring out this huge hat for the celebrant to wear - it's a pretty cool experience!  Our grandchildren totally enjoy the show put on by the Teppanyaki Chef. It really is an entertaining experience.   Despite the fact that they've experienced Teppanyaki cooking at several different restaurants - our grand children continue to enjoy the anticipation of participating in the Chef's show in one shape or another.   The service is excellent, the food is wonderful, and the ambiance is beautiful. Oh, did I forget to mention their prices are quite reasonable? .  It's a great place to bring the family, friends or even going solo."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise, right when you walk in you get a good vibe from the place. We came when they had a happy hour going and they have tons of options to choose from food wise, an got a blue moon for 2$ that's awesome in my book. Sushi came out amazing, me and my gf got one crazy roll. and it was so good that we ordered another. Food tastes delicious.  Service was great. We will definitely be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. But finding a cockroach crawl from the bar and seeing it crawl in front of you while you're eating was not pleasant."}
{"text":"Sucks, they took forever to bring out the food and when they did, it was wrong, and my brothers straw was salty, \"what happened to it,\" is the interesting mystery we won't ever seem to solve."}
{"text":"Went in for a sushi lunch alone. Sat at the sushi bar. I hate that my back is to the entrance but what are you gonna do.  They were very speedy and fish was super fresh. One thing I didn't like was how thick the sashimi was cut. It was cut into huge chunks. I like eating sashimi in one bite. These you had to take several bites of. I mean, great you get more fish, but they really need to cut it into nice thin segments. I liked that it was on a bed of ice and had a colorful strobe light underneath. The nigiri was cut nice and thin and there wasn't too much rice which I liked. The California roll was delicious. Loved the sesame seeds on the outside. Added a nice crunchy and nutty element.  I will absolutely be returning.  But can you guys please slice the sashimi thinner? Thanks."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and always sit at the Teppan table.  We have always had great service, sometimes it faster then others but we have always left feeling deliciously full and entertained.  We love the fun atmosphere and table comradery.  The most recent time we went we took our son and he said it was the coolest restaurant he's been to.  This place is very busy on the weekends so make a reservation and expect to wait about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Muy divertido y muy rica la comida. Trato estupendo. Merece la pena ir. Eso si... Con sentido del humor y no os pong√°is la mejor ropa porque podr√≠a mancharse cuando os lanzen comida o el sake!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE  Japanese restaurant, the staff is friendly, very attentive, the food is good, the Sake Squirting is a lot fun! I have gone with a big group, and also with my boyfriend for lunch. We have celebrated several birthdays here, and have had a  great time :). I definitely enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Vegas roll was good. Couldn't believe how big all the sushi rolls are. Very flavorful. We did the teppanyaki and it was delicious and entertaining. A great way to spend your birthday. Check in on yelp and get a free tempura ice cream. The kids loved it.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I took my daughter who was visiting from Colorado to this restaurant because I had been there before and I absolutely loved it! When we got there we were given no time to look at the menu,  there were three of us and we were given 1 menu! We hurried up and ordered since we felt pressured to hurry up. Our food arrived and we're given no plates to place our food on so we used the napkins that thank god were provided. We asked for plates and finally got some.  As the waiter cleared the table he spilled sauce all over me! I talked to the manager Tony and explained to him what had happened.  His response was \"ok I will ask my waiter to be more careful. \"  I was very disappointed that the manager was very nonchalant about my situation.  He made no effort to make this right. Very disappointed in them not valuing me as a customer."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to Japanese restaurant. The sushi is great, the teppanyaki is top notch and the staff are friendly. I have never had a bad experience whether sitting at the sushi bar, dining room or grill.  The shrimp/lobster teppanyaki is great along with the filet. The yoki noddles are amazing as well. Great food, friendly staff and always an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"We were disappointed based on the rating. I believe the ratings were based on the tepanyaki side of the restaurant. We had sushi only. The sweet shrimp, tuna and eel were not fresh. The service was poor, the bar staff was less than professional loudly talking about the woman at the bar. But bottom line...if your a big sushi only fan...i would avoid. I would've rated 2 stars, but the redeeming value was the prices were cheap for sushi."}
{"text":"I had the best 25 th birthday dinner here. Everyone in our party was so pleased with the food and service. Not to mention   my 2 year old son had an absolute blast  watching the chef flipping food and showing off his fire starter skills . The best time ever!! I would go back every year."}
{"text":"Amazing tapenyaki experience, went with my sister-in-law and fiance for a dinner before we leave town. We had the Garlic Edamame which is cooked in this amazing soy garlic sauce with dried chili peppers! Fantastic. The calamari app is also delicious, its got a crispness that i have never experienced with calamari.   We went on a day where it wasnt very busy and we had a reservation so we were promptly seated. Be aware that you do have to wait for your chef to come if you sit at a tapenyaki grill but it is WELL worth it. We left satisfied and full! Super affordable if you have ever experienced New York prices.   We were also given a small complementary champagne as we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. Will definately come back during our next trip!"}
{"text":"Went here before their grand opening and it was AMAZING! The leftovers I took home were even better to eat the next day! The staff was so nice and our teppanyaki chef was so funny and really entertaining. We are coming back tomorrow with a big group and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Omg if you have not been here you are sooo missing out. The food is, oh my so fantastic. Always fresh, hot and delicious! Sevice is excellent. Please visit you will NOT be sorry!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! The mushroom broth to start is tasty! Great quality food, decent prices! Chefs are entertaining and friendly. My kids love going just for the entertainment and trying to catch the food that the chef throws at them. I love the fried rice and the shrimp! The chefs are very generous with sake so you probably won't even have to buy any :)"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious food! Excellent service! They seated our party of 6 on a Friday night at 6:00pm within 5 minutes with no reservation. Loved the American Dream sushi roll. Kids got shrimp and fried rice and loved it too! Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Will definitely go back regularly."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year but haven't done a review. I don't normally do one but I have to because Tony, David and Alex are the very best! They go far and beyond to make you feel welcomed, and taken care of in every way! We love Osaka, however, these guys makes us pick this place every time  it's a special occasion or just regular days because of their outstanding service"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 8 and when we showed up at 7:50 were told we would have a fifteen minute wait, not a problem. At 8:30 we still didn't have a table. We gave up at that point and went to a different restaurant. Rather disappointed with our experience seeing as we went there for my birthday and my boyfriend had never been to a restaurant like this and was looking forward to it. The staff wasn't informing us of anything that was going on with our table and when we told them we had been waiting for 20 minutes and we're wondering if they had marked us down all they said \"yeah we got you.\" And mentioned nothing about our 20 minute wait. I've heard great things about this place and an extremely disappointed we didn't get to experience it. Guess we'll be going somewhere else for birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Had the chicken tempura (sp?) the chef was great and entertaining. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I've never in my life experienced such terrible service. My family and I were seated for over twenty minutes without an eye batted at us. To be honest I've never even heard of such a thing. Regardless, I notified the hostess prior to our departure and she could have cared less. We didn't even receive a simple sorry. Just a \"really??? Twenty minutes?\" then she buried her head back in the list. To these people we were just another unsatisfied family whom they could care less about. It's a shame too, because we frequented the establishment on a regular basis. From now on our business will be taken elsewhere, and so will our verbal disgust of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place, fun atmosphere, good tasty food, and hilarious entertainment. This is my first visit to Osaka Gilbert location, possibly not my last. You get plenty of food and the price is very reasonable. The restaurant is kinda loud, but noise of customers enjoying themselves along with their chefs. Good place to come and enjoy with friends and family around the hibachi grill. My meal consisted of chicken, steak, garlic green beans, rice, veggies, and noodles. All were pretty good, no complaints. I would definitely recommend people to try it out for yourself. Looks to be kid friendly for those with little ones. They have a cool happy birthday song, but I kept my special day a secret."}
{"text":"Not happy at all! My wife and I loved going to Ooka and always had a great time. After the new owners took over we had to go see the new changes. We arrived at 7 and left at 740 after no one helped us. The wait staff just kept awkwardly staring at us and us at them. After leaving we made the short drive to AH-So that is just down the road. Promptly seated and got great food."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Did not disappoint! They have quite a good selection for happy hour. It was great presentation. It's huge sushi rolls lol! Great service! I will def be going back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the spring rolls and the Las Vegas rolls and they were both delicious and the service from Amy was excellent. The only thing I would change is that it was hard to find parking. Other than that this place is great we will definitely be back. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this Japanese-style steakhouse open up in my neighborhood because I love Japanese food. Upon entering I was immediately impressed with the lovely interior design and cleanliness. The decor and furnishings are very tasteful and relaxing. I especially liked the way the bar and teppan dining areas are softly lit from below.  After I was seated and the server came to my table I had a moment of concern. My waitress was authentically Japanese and she approached my table smiling and pleasant, but then just stood there without speaking. I finally asked her for hot green tea and water. She nodded without saying anything and went off to get it but then I had the sinking feeling she didn't speak much English and was afraid there might be a communication problem. Turns out I had no need to worry. Though she never said much at all the whole time she was serving me, she got everything right. Plus, they must operate on a team concept because other servers also came by to check on me or clear empty dishes as they passed by, so I never wanted for service or attention.  I was there for a late lunch and the restaurant was fairly empty at that time, so I would like to go back sometime when they are busy to see if they maintain the same level of service.  The green tea was a bit of a let down at first. I know green tea isn't supposed to be served boiling hot like one would serve black tea, but the first cup of it was actually room-temperature cold. The second cup was the proper temp, though, and it was organic tea, so all was good there.  I'm a fan of bento box meals and so I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki box. These are accompanied by a little bowl of miso soup and a small house salad. The hostess had told me that appetizers were half price so I also ordered a starter. My server bought out the soup and salad before the appetizer, so I don't know if she was confused about the order of service or just didn't want me to wait for food. Not a big deal, but next time I will order the app separately and then order the main course after it is served.  The appetizer was Age-dashi Tofu, little squares of homemade tofu lightly fried and served with a interesting sprinkle of seaweed seasonings and tempura dipping sauce. It turned out to be a large portion of six good-sized squares of silken tofu that were delicately crispy on the outside with an interior that was virtually the consistency of melt-in-your-mouth pudding. Wonderful, but they were the temperature of fresh lava on the inside and I burnt my mouth trying to eat them.  I turned instead to the miso soup (not bad, but a wee bit bland, even for miso soup - a sprinkle of chopped green onion would have made it better) and the little salad (also not bad, but I was somewhat disappointed in the dressing which just tasted like commercial 1000 Island.) Meanwhile. the bento box was served so I tucked into that was well. Throughout the meal I kept trying to eat more of the Age-dashi Tofu but it just never seemed to cool off.  The box contents were very satisfying. The chicken portion was tender and served on a small bed of stir-fried veggies in a classic and tasty teriyaki sauce. It also came with a good fried rice, 5 large pieces of California roll, and pot stickers (menu said 3, I only got 2.)  So I had one appetizer half-priced for $2.50, a bento box combo for $9 and unlimited cups of organic green tea for $2 and there was enough food that I was able to bring nearly 1/2 of it home for lunch tomorrow. In the end, the food was good but not great, with good service and a pleasant atmosphere that I will be happy to return to."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Went last Sun night with wife (first time) the food was delicious we both had the steak & lobster at a teppen table more food then any human can consume at one sitting. Every person at the table needed boxes. The prices are very very reasonable ours under $30 ea. Will definitely be back, already told some friends & planing a group outing there. If I had one small complaint it would be that the shrimp appetizer got cooked last and I was to full by then, I would have liked it to hit the plate as an appetizer more at the start of the meal, like with the mountain of fried rice I got. All and all the best dinning experience I've had in the east valley in a long time......"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Great sushi! Great teppanyaki! Great service!  Recommended. The sushi rolls were enormous! Yummy!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice blonde hostess.  very nice and welcoming  Now for the food we got tequila , mamma mia and Vegas , they were  amazing ! Then for desert we got Fried ice cream yummy also. my wife and I experience was amazing. Will be back"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever seen and received from a server. I witnessed people orders being forgotten or being really late. This was my first and last time coming here. Service is awful but food was good"}
{"text":"Came here on my Birthday on 2-24 and all I can say this is the place to eat in Peoria, AZ! The food was awesome and the service was even better. My daughter tried sushi for the first time and loved it.  The kids got to beat the drum for my birthday celebration and the show on the grill was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"I had an orgasm while eating Tony's roll, the food is exquisite and my favorite part is listening to people partake in the live drummer for birthdays"}
{"text":"Tried Osaka for the first time tonight.  I can't believe we didn't go sooner.  The happy hour deals are amazing.  Drinks were great.  I got a Cosmo for $5 and my husband's Blue Moon beer was $2.   The  sushi was so good and presented just beautifully.  We also got fantastic service from Kris. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in AZ yet. Just moved here 3 mos ago from Southern California & was striking out with every spot I tried. Finally I found my go to sushi spot. Ambiance very nice, fast service, professional, & most of all fresh delicious sushi. I highly recommend the the specialty rolls: Temple Roll and the Citrus Roll.   All in all, if you've had great sushi, and won't settle for anything less than great sushi, then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner at 9:00 on a Monday night and were the only ones in the restaurant. They said the crowd had just left. Which was fine by us because we had excellent service. Our teppan chef was entertaining and our server Michael was very attentive. I had the scallops and my husband had the filet and scallops. His filet was delicious. The price for dinner was very reasonable. If I'm in the area I will stop again for dinner."}
{"text":"New management destroyed this place. If it ain't broken don't fix it.  Why would you replace a totally fine Japanese rice with a Chinese jasmine rice?  Do you really think making the rice purple will excite new customers? Here you actually lost multiple customers because we usually go with family and friends."}
{"text":"Good is delicious and service was outstanding. They let me try a different kinds of fish on the house.  Life uni  very delicious.   I'm satiated!"}
{"text":"Great place!!  Took 3 kids and my wife there for dinner. The prices are MUCH more affordable than other places nearby and the food was frankly much better as well."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays one adult one 11 year old. We had been here before and she said this is where she wanted to go for her 11 birthday.  So we did. Made reservations for 7:30pm we were not seated till close to 8pm there were total of 7 in party  2 children including birthday girl. We sat there for at least 45 min. Before we got a Chef maybe it was more.  Then the guy we got was a complete  bore. He was not entertaining at all by this time kids were tired and very hungry.  He did a few tricks nothing special.  He didn't talk unless talked to. Food was not bad.. the most fun was the mask they let u put on at end. This was 10pm. We all were very disappointed. Have been here many Times both sides and was ok. But will NOT go back again. To top it all off the man who took my reservation was rude and the same guy sat us at table was also rude. Might of been manager.  There too long just sitting doing nothing. Didn't get anything till after 9pm. Write this place off many places in town that do the same thing with entertainment! !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, very enjoyable atmosphere and amazing food!  We went right at 5 o'clock and sat at the hibachi. We were very pleased that they allowed us to go ahead and have hibachi even though it was just 2 of us. Our chef, Joe, was super fun and nice.  Will definitely being returning!"}
{"text":"If you asked me last year I would have given five stars. Since this place has opened, my husband and I have gone there for every special occasion. For the last month I have looked forward to going for my birthday. We saved up our money because we go all out when we are there and always spend over $100 on one meal. Normally we don't mind because we feel, for a treat, it is worth it. On my birthday this year, however, our experience was horrible. It ruined the day for me. The waiter got our order wrong twice. The first time it was for the teppan and the chef was able to correct it easily. The second was with our appetizers, that didn't get to our table until after the chef was already cooking our entrees, and  my husband's appetizer was not what he ordered at all. The waiter said he would get the correct one and then disappeared for half an hour, leaving us thirsty for drink refills. When he finally appeared with my husband's appetizer we were nearly finished with dinner. Lastly the lobster I ordered was not fresh at all. The chef did overcook it as well but even if it was cooked right you could tell just by looking at it that it was not good. I was a waitress for a long time so I tend to sympathize with waiters and do not complain often but the service was horrendous. I did speak to the manager and, after waiting for another twenty minutes to talk to him, he did remove the lobster from the bill but the damage was done. I was crushed that the meal I had been looking forward to on my special day was so disappointing. I will be celebrating at other places from now on. This isn't only because of one experience because I could have let that go. It is because, even though he fixed the bill, the manager was very inconsiderate and rude. He wouldn't let me speak and kept brushing me off. I will not frequent an establishment with people like that in charge. The two stars is for the food we actually did get to eat. It was very good but I can get good food at another place with better staff and a friendlier atmosphere. Sorry about the long rant but I was really upset with my experience."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow at the bar. The service at the tables are a little better. Food is good. The chefs that come out are very entertaining and fun.  Been here a few times with large parties and other times with like 4 people. Sushi stays together for the most part. Appetizers and entr√©es are seasoned well and consistent. The establishment is overall clean.   I'd go back. Kinda fun here."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Japanese food but it wasn't that bad. The rest of the Family enjoyed it. We will be back agian"}
{"text":"Our meal was pretty good. Especially for an ad-hoc dinner. Prices were decent. We had the chirasi and dynamite appetizer. Both were good and filling!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for my birthday and had the teppenyaki.  My husband and I both thought the meal was wonderful.  The soup had a lot of flavor although a little skimpy on the mushrooms.  The dressing on the salad was something I had never tasted before but I loved it.  Then came the cook.  He did the usual tricks with the eggs and the spatula and lighting the tabletop on fire, but what I wasn't expecting was shooting saki in everyone's mouth.  I'm sure it was watered down but who cares!  It added a whole new element of fun to the experience.  Our steak, calimari, shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly.    Looking around at some of the different cooks at the tables, some have better personalities than others.  Ours was fairly entertaining but there were other tables that were REALLY having fun. Was kind of wishing we'd had a different cook only because of that.  I had no complaints about the quality of the food he cooked.  We will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and each time keeps getting better! I highly recommend the \"Dynamite\" appetizer, I almost wish you could get this as an entree!  The service is friendly and fast, great atmosphere! I also like how the dinning room is separated so if you don't want to sit by the Teppanyaki grill you don't have to."}
{"text":"I tried Osaka for the first time last friday night 10/19/2012. I ordered the bento combination. the tempura tasted doughy like the batter was just a cheap flour mixture. The Gyoza dumplings were cold. They probably were not in the microwave long enough. the salad dressing was a thousand island. The food and drinks  are overpriced the floor was empty at 8PM there was no one sitting at the bar.The mens room floor was sticky. I pointed that out to a server and she said they will clean it tomorrow because it is so busy. I give this place 6 months. Nice decor."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere, very friendly staff and delicious food. We are always greeted with a smile. The lunch specials are a great deal, lots of tasty food at a good price. We frequently order take out and the hostess is always helpful and offers great suggestions. I give them 5 stars for service and taste!"}
{"text":"This is a great place, nice food,nice environment. I like tepenyaki, the chef is wonderful, great show,nice service. It's Japanese style. As I know, the chef always change the more than 8% tips of the amount of the food you spend, and the rest split by waiter and something.  Everytime I tip chef for my personal, but I will left 20% tips in the check also. In a word, if u like the chef, you can tip the extra for chef, but don not forget to tip the server,  they only receive the rest tip(except 8%), in other hand, if you spend 100 $for the meal, but you just tip 8$ on the check, the server will get nothing!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious great service  Nice to find s great sushi place in Mesa  Everything looked and tasted wonderful"}
{"text":"Love coming here. The sushi is amazing.  But the oyster shooters are our favorite.   Friendly service"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for her 30th birthday. Reservation was made for 7pm in the dining area as we wanted it to be a little more private than sitting at the tempenyaki table with tons of random people. We arrived at 6:40pm and were told to wait 10 min for our seat. I wouldn't even give this place 1 damn star if I could !!!! Around 7:15 I asked hey anyway we can get a seat we were told around 6:50 our table would be ready... hostess looks at me and rudely tells me well we haven't sat anyone for reservations at 7 and walks away. Rude service! We proceeded to wait only to be seated in the wrong damn place! Absolutely horrible. Way to ruin my wife's 30th birthday."}
{"text":"was in town for work and found this gem on yelp. very happy i did! had a geisha roll, and a Mediterranean roll. both were very tasty. tiffany was my waitress and was very prompt with service. the only thing i could come up with negative is that the rolls marked as spicy were mild at best. but easily remedied with some wasabi and Sriracha. the tempura ice cream was huge so be ready if you use the yelp offer because it is good and will max you out. im a very big guy and 2 rolls, appetizer, and a miso set me over the edge.  i would recomend to anyone who likes sushi!"}
{"text":"Deserves ZERO stars!  Reservations at 6:00.  Checked in at 5:30 & they told us they didn't know when we'd get served.  Seated at 7:10 & then told it'd be at LEAST 30 minutes before any food service!  We left and will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi quality. The waitress service was just OK but the food was amazing. The cuts of sashimi were the biggest I have seen. My new favorite sushi place. The manager was great at correcting our issue."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. We sat at a teppenyaki table and had a great time with our chef Jeremiah.  The sushi roll \"spicy girl\" was excellent and the garlic edamame was delicious. My husband had the filet and chicken and I had the shrimp. Everything was tasty, and the rice and veges perfect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday, we made reservations for a grill, 14 people @1800.  We were seated by the hostess at 1830. Then at 1835 we were asked to leave the table because it \"wasn't our table\"..and another large group was seated there.  All this after parking in the worst layout of a parking lot possible. (It's shared with a hotel and other restaurants). It's now 1900. Table staff was very courteous, chef was pretty awesome but had same jokes and tricks as every other kung fu chop chop chef there.   Pros: Food was good, drinks were good, prices are great for the chefs effort, skill and showmanship. Great selection of food and drink.  Cons: Parking, poor hostess skills... and the noise (Friday night) if you are hard of hearing; hearing aids etc this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Not that impressed.  It may be because it was a holiday (New Years) but our service was slow as molasses.  We were told a 5-10 minutes wait for the teppanyaki but it ended up being about 45 minutes.  When I was about to bail for another restaurant they finally seated us.  The food tasted alright.  Rice and shrimp were good.  Chicken was so-so.  The chef at our table was just OK.  In general, I don't plan on going back but it wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last and was amazing. The performance by the chef was top notch and food delicious. They have a repeat customer for sure as will have to go back to try their sushi"}
{"text":"Went there again last week with my family everything was good only issue is that all those who ate sushi rolls got sick with a stomach issues!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant and as it was just my husband and I, we sat at the bar.  I ordered the chicken dinner and my husband got the chicken and shrimp.  We both enjoyed the mushroom soup very much.  We then began the salad and were enjoying that until I began to poke at a white chunk in my salad I thought might be a rouge piece of tofu and found out was a chewed up piece of gum.  Quite disgusted I alerted our server, the bartender.  She apologized, took the dish away and returned with a new salad, which I did not want.  She apologized again and walked off without offering any accommodations. It wasn't until we were almost done with our meal when she offered my husband a beer on the house, apologizing to him.  When I  finished my beer I said I would like one too, which she acted surprised by.  When the bill came we saw she did not even comp my beer when I was the one with chewed gum in my salad.  I  brought it to another server/ manager's attention who took my beer off and nothing further then another apology.  The chicken was dry, the shrimp and vegetables were good. The place has potential in some areas, so I have it  2 stars, but I was hard pressed to do so."}
{"text":"Big improvement over Ooka.  Sashimi was fresh and presentation excellent (on ice). My Wife's bento box dinner was very good, beef was a good cut very tender.  It was Valentine's day so the rose and 1 cent champagne was a surprise.  Rolls look good but prefer Sashimi to separate the flavors.  Ika (squid) salad was well done nice touch on the baby greens, tasty.  Hope my pic is posted.  Will be back,  12 yrs since arriving to Az from Calif and I finally found my family spot."}
{"text":"Love the service, prices.  Wonderful presentation and quality of the sushi.  Happy hour is longer than usual, which is nice."}
{"text":"Happy hour rocks!! Fresh seafood and fast! Friendly and clean! Defiantly coming back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour menu and great atmosphere! Love to come here with friends for amazing sushi and drinks!! Friendly service too! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Absolutely great.  Awesome food.  Love the atmosphere and decor. Waitress was fantastic. Very helpful and friendly. Happy Hour  has a great selection and great prices.  Found a new favorite place."}
{"text":"Great staff and food! Shoutout to Levi and Kris, even though Kris broke my friends heart):"}
{"text":"Very tasty, I have had both Ah-So and Osaka and Osaka is better. I know experiences will vary based on chef but mine was awesome and put on a  great show. And the dinner for two combo was awesome. You can't beat their prices!"}
{"text":"Osaka is definitely delicious for the money. I've been there twice now and both times the food was of high quality and super delicious. The teppanyaki shows have been enjoyable both times and despite having a similar routine, both cooks managed to make it fun and different.  Our first time in, on my father's birthday, we had no problem being seated during our reserved time slot. However, we returned on Father's Day to wait almost an hour past our reserved time to be seated. Understandable considering it's a holiday, but they should be more careful on overbooking their time slots. It was worth the wait in the end as we all had an enjoyable time and good food, just thought I would mention that holidays might be a bit more packed than advertised.  I haven't had their sushi personally but my two siblings have and say it's delicious. I've had the steak and calamari teppanyaki both times and it's to die for. The calamari especially is flavorful and not at all rubbery like some places, it's so good! Tried the fried gyoza last time and it was also extremely delicious. Great place, would recommend it overall!"}
{"text":"First time poster here, basically because this place has compelled me!) Believe me when I tell you that I know the difference between bad sushi, average sushi, and great sushi. I have experienced most of what the valley offers up as \"great sushi\" including Supporos, Sushi Ki, Kabuki, etc, THIS PLACE TRUMPS THEM ALL. We were completely taken by surprise when we discovered this gem last night. We sat at the sushi bar and asked the sushi chefs to surprise us. Surprise us they did with a roll called Osaka Chef Special, (which is what they were experimenting with at the time) and were treated to a fantastic spicey roll that was not only amazing to look at, but extremely clean, tight, and masterly put together. As we kept ordering, we found out that the head sushi chef was a 10 year vet out of some of the best houses in NYC, and basically brought those same items to Osaka's and was busy training the other oriental chefs. Impressive. Besides the killer sushi, the place looks very sharp inside from modern flooring and wood ceilings, to stacked stone wall accents. Very cool decor. (Although their choice in music is from a bad Esteban album) I hope they survive in Mesa, which is a city that rarely rewards good cuisine unless it's cheap wings and burgers."}
{"text":"So excited to have such a nice place opening in SE Mesa!  We usually have to drive to Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, etc. to get this kind of atmosphere.  For drinks we ordered wine and sake.  Appetizers were half off for happy hour, so we got gyzo (pot stickers) and calamari.  The calamari came in rings and was very crispy.  We then split 3 sushi rolls - the citrus roll was excellent!  We didn't wait long for anything, and even though it was our server's second day on the job, she did great and was very attentive.  Only complaint, as someone has already mentioned, is that you have to ask for water.  I prefer they automatically bring water out with the drinks, especially when it's 110 degrees outside."}
{"text":"I don't understand how ppl gives 4 5 stars to this place for god sake ok service fine slowest one but nice people. BUT have u never fuckin ate sushi or calamari? This was worse than Walmart sushi for god sake"}
{"text":"Chef was super nice! Only problem was that I called a day ahead for a reservation of 10 and they had us waiting one whole hour before we could be seated! But they did make up for it with free drinks and appetizers! Overall great place ! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I really used to enjoy coming here, but for the past year or so the staff has gotten from bad to worse.  The service is extremely slow, which is not why I'm giving them one stupid star, but there were ants all over our table, climbing up the wall and falling back down to the table.  Like literally raining ants. Ant rain. And when we told the waitress, she started killing the ants and crushing them under her fingers. So yeah, I don't know if ya'll like dinner and a show, but if you enjoy watching your waiter crush bugs after they serve you food, then Osaka is your place"}
{"text":"The team at Osaka went above and beyond our expectations. The bartender Cody suggested excellent starters for my family while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. We moved into the teppan grill room and were amazed by Sam's skill. He was so funny and great at picking up on what every person individually would be entertained by. We highly recommend the restaurant as a place for a birthday. It was actually my birthday and they have quite a surprise for you. That's all I'll share. Great job Sam."}
{"text":"Went here twice in one week. Once for a work dinner and then with my wife a few days later. Great food, great entertainment, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have tried just about every sushi restaurant in the valley, and Osaka's was by far the best. The \"Lisa Lisa\"  and \"Playboy\" rolls are incredible. We go at least once a week now."}
{"text":"This place was fun. We did the teppanyaki, the chef was fun and lively. The food was great. The only thing I didn't like was that the rice was too salty, and didn't care much for the salad. It seams they didn't strain the salad so it was soupy at the bottom  :/. Other than that it was great. We will go back!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! Girlfriend and I hit many a Japanese Steakhouse. The staff was very good. It was in the early evening so not super busy. By the time we were leaving, it was picking up a good bit. Very relaxing. No one pushing to clear the table, ect... The food was EXCELLENT! The flavors were incredible. I had lobster and shrimp. Only down side was when I was done eating I had nothing to take home with me. I never eat more than half of a rice order. I couldn't stop eating the rice. It's been about two weeks since our visit and twice this week I have heard my girl say, \"this filet is no where close to Osaka.\" She had the chicken and filet. Again, the show, presentation and the food were all wonderful. We did not order any sushi, but it too looked excellent. The couple next to us commented that it was the best they have had since leaving San Francisco. We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Teppanyaki.  Very reasonable for lunch. Best Fried Rice Big shrimp Good Filet Mignon Good Service"}
{"text":"This is where my 10 year old daughter chose the night of Daddy Daughter Dance!  Atmosphere was great!  She is not a huge eater and really only wanted California Rolls, so we did not sit on the Teppanyaki side! We ordered a couple Cali rolls and a couple others!  I was amazed at how reasonable the prices were!  Of course while we were there all she was interested in was the show coming from the teppanyaki side!  So needless to say she is begging to go back!  The staff was all nice and very attentive!  Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and service. The topanyaki is amazing and always a fun environment for a meal."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time we go. Our fav for sushi is the Osaka Roll great presentation and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite teppanyaki restaurant in the Gilbert/Chandler/Mesa/Queen Creek area. Our chef was witty and attentive. Fried rice was bomb af and their sauces were incredible. I don't usually care for the sauces and I drenched my veggies and proteins in them.   Kinda got upset when my hubs ate my leftovers the next day... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"we ate Hibachi style and the chef and food were amazing. The chef was super funny and made it for a Great experience for the whole family and table. Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really fun and has great food. We have been back twice now and each time I love it more and more. If you bring your kids, the kids portions are much more than I was expecting but a great value for $8"}
{"text":"it's an okay steak house. with some Asian dishes. it's good if you can't drive to the better steak houses in Tempe and downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Without question the best teppanyaki place I have ever been to. Our chef was very entertaining, funny, and over all enjoyable. We had a blast with the sake countdown and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.  Our whole group had a wonderful time and greatly enjoyed our meal. Food was cooked well and again the chef put on a good show thru out. We ended up being the last ones to leave and our server was great at keeping water cups full way after we had paid our bill.  Highly recommended for get togethers and events. What a blast!"}
{"text":"So impressed with this place. Great quality food. Flawless service.  Entertaining and fun.  Sunday is good day to go if you have kids because it's  kids eat free day.  Can't wait to go again.   Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"So we went to Osaka for a great friends birthday dinner.  There were 9 of us at the teppan table.  We all were enjoying our time.  The ambiance was great for birthday occasions since they play the birthday song like every 5 minutes it seemed.   The Chef came out and performed his routine.  He over cooked 2 of our parties steak and said he would make another one and NEVER did.  We were eating when clean plates arrived for the next party.  Upon getting our dessert an employee walked over to me and said \"I really shouldn't be asking you this but I am going to\" then proceed to say \"could your party please take your conversation to the bar?\"  I looked at him and was like your kidding right?  Oh, no your not....  We had only been at this table for less than  an hour and half before they were chasing us out.  Whats sad is the teppan table across from us had 2 new people at it with 7 open seats.  It gets better!  So our group proceeds outside to then be chased by the waiter,  Chris, who approaches one of our group and says \"you don't leave tip.\"  \"You don't want to tip me?\"  After reviewing the charge slip it wasn't even his tab it was another person in our group that left a cash tip.  SERIOUSLY your going to chase after a table that you just ran off inquiring about a tip.  YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING!  This was my first and last experience at this place.  I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in the many years of eating out.  Things probably wont change as it seemed to be a busy placed.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place EVER. If I wrote a review months ago, I would write endlessly about how amazing their service and sushi is. (I still could write endlessly about both). However, for the first time we tried their teppanyaki and now I don't know which one I'm in love with more!  We go here for every anniversary and special occasion. It makes for such a nice romantic date or simply just an amazing meal. Their sushi is fresh and the best I've ever had. And their teppanyaki is amazing. The cooks are incredibly friendly, nice, and entertaining. And their fillet minion is now all I think about.  I recommend this to everyone I know, so I definitely think it deserves a review on Yelp. TRY THIS PLACE, I have never had anything less than perfect.. And I've been here quite a lot"}
{"text":"Good idea that did not deliver. The ambiance was ok but not very Japanese at all. Greeted casually and seated at the nearest table with no inquiry to our desires. Service was polite but far from excellent. The dirty martini had virtually no vodka in it just olive juice. Ordered another plain that also had no vodka. (How do they do that?). Had sashimi. Very marginal quality. Presentation was good. Wasabi had no flavor. Miso soup was mediocre and salad was drowned in dressing. I was very disappointed and will look elsewhere for sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a date night and decided to try something different. This review is based off the sushi side. We ordered the Sashimi Sushi for two.  19 pieces of fish. Salmon tasted a little fishy, oddly.  But the rest of the Sashimi was good. One with red snapper had mint with rice (definitely was not my favorite...yuck!!). We ordered one roll called citrus roll. Little did we know sushi for two come with spicy tuna roll and California roll with black rice. The rolls at this place was good. But whatever you do, DO NOT order any tempura ice cream. The tempura was nasty and cake like and was not done right. We basically just ate the ice cream inside."}
{"text":"So good! Get the filet minion. Amazing prices on the weekday lunches. Kids plates are free with each adult entree on Sundays. Two adult plates, two kids plates, and sushi $56. Not bad for a Sunday lunch.   Food is VERY good!"}
{"text":"Great Time. Took my parents here and they had a blast. They do the standard show here for this type of place but it's done well. Food was good the roll I had was great. If you are looking for a good interactive dining experience this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best staff and best service! They are always friendly! I come at least once a week and I wish I could go everyday just because of the staff. Thank you for being so great!"}
{"text":"Just amazing pure and simple ! And $1 sake on Tuesday? ? Whaaaahh !! So I have changed my taco Tuesdays to Sake Tuesdays haha"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and the sushi was great!  The service was prompt and friendly. The one thing that seemed odd to me, and I've lived in Japan on two occasions for close to three years, was having the curry prepared on a bed of lettuce. I love curry rice but this was like curry dressing on a salad. Tasty but would have enjoyed it more in the rice where it belonged."}
{"text":"It appears to be better than Ooka Hibachi from what I experienced. The service is still not up to Japanese standards, but better than it was before.   The food is really good! If you love teppanyaki you will enjoy eating here. The prices are expensive, but teppanyaki is never cheap. I enjoyed my experience and would return. This place definitely beats out Ah-So."}
{"text":"The best all around. Great teppan,  awesome Sushi, and good drinks. We eat here regularly and are never disappointed. Try the filet mignon, spicy tuna roll, or veggie gyoza. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food. Their happy hour is good the prices are nice but i wish it started later like 4:00pm. It starts at 2:30 to 6:00. How many people get off in the middle of the day? The regular sitting area is too small. They only have 7 or 8 tables. The other area with the personal chef is huge... i recommend this place"}
{"text":"My overall experience was good.service was fast sashimi was fresh! They did screw my order up and gave me the sashimi dinner instead of the bento dinner with sashimi. But I had no complaints it was good and going back tonight."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's 31st birthday party here last night with some of our very close friends and the experience was amazing! The teppenyaki chef was very animated and prepared our food with the finest precision, the bartender Alex and our servers were all on point! All in all, our experience with the delicious cuisine, the ambience, the excellent customer service was something that needed to be commended!! It was so good, that we returned the very next day to be taken care of by our awesome server David.   Most definitely, my friends, family and especially myself, will make this a required destination in the near future!"}
{"text":"If you are running out of restaurants to try out, then do stop by and give this place a shot.  Otherwise, I personally wouldn't go there again.  Pro: - Great service.  - Sushi is okay...fresh, but horrible cut.  If you don't care about the cut or you don't know how that matters, then you will be fine here.  - Complimentary \"fresh wasabi\" - Yellowtail Sushi & Steak House will charge you $2  bucks for it.  Con: - Osaka doesn't update their website from time to time.  If you are looking for happy house info, call them up.  Otherwise, all those online info may not be accurate or out-dated.  - Very low value on food.  Let me make this easy - If you REALLY want the food from Osaka, then you might as well go to a Kabuki Japanese restaurant nearby.  Not that I love Kabuki's, but it's better compare to Osaka's.  With that being said, if you are salty food...then Osaka might be a good choice for you.  Notes - If you HAVE to be here because of a gathering or event, then go for Sushi or salad.  Their spicy seafood udon is the worst I had in my life."}
{"text":"We will be back!  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and quickly seated.  We were told that there was only a short a!pint of time left in Happy Hour and shown that menu too.  I don't even think we were seated a full minute when our waiter came over to see if we knew what we wanted to drink.  After he returned with our drinks, he asked if we had any questions about the menu.  We didn't and told him we were ready to order.  Everything we ordered was from the happy hour menu.  What can I say, great selection!  We ordered edamame and our waiter asked if we wanted regular or garlic.  We didn't even know garlic was an option, but it sounded great, so we went with it.  And what a good decision it was.  We are every last one.  For our meal, we chose 3 varieties of special rolls:. Crazy Roll (delish), Godzilla Roll (ok, but not a fave) and River Roll (another winner).  We were very happy with the flavor combinations and the freshness of all three rolls.  And service was excellent.  The manager even stopped by to ask how it was.  We appreciate that.  About 5 minutes before happy hour ended , our waiter did stop by again to inform us and ask if we wanted anything else from that menu.  We didn't want anything else, but liked that they asked.  We know we will return!"}
{"text":"Went to Osaka on Monday night so there was no wait. The staff was friendly and the establishment was clean. Alex who was our chef was excellent. The food was amazing.. we had the shrimp and steak with veggies. Amy who was our waitress was also very good and friendly. Would recommend this place for everyone of all ages!!"}
{"text":"We've been here many many times. And been very very pleased every time. However, while the food is still seemingly just as good. The last two times we've been here the service and the amount of time it takes to get your food are seriously going downhill. Noticeable difference?no Danny. He's been here as long as we have been coming. And he's not here now. Again good food but mass chaos in the service of said good food."}
{"text":"It was Birthday night at six other tables.  Fun, fun, funny with their head hats and crazy poses.  The food and chefery was terrific and not totally loaded with butter and salt (as elsewhere).  The prices are acceptable, especially when there is an excellent savings coupon.  We shared our extra coupon with our tablemates and everyone was even happier."}
{"text":"the \"show\" at the table was great.  the steak overcooked as was the lobster. very little flavor or spice on the steak or lobster.  they leave everything to the sauce, which is just OK. Birthday acknowledgement is fun but noisy."}
{"text":"Osaka has been making some changes recently and it has left me disappointed. In the beginning the service was bad because I somehow always got stuck with the rude server, Sophia but she's no longer there. However, I still went because Osaka had my favorite sushi there. Usually went during happy hour and with the new servers, they all had given me good customer service. I always order 4 of the same sushi roll because like I said, it's my favorite. Recently, they did something different and when I mentioned it to the server, she told me it's how they've always made it. It kind of bothered me that she tried to come up with an excuse rather than fixing it even though she eventually did. The last visit was the final straw for me. Again, I ordered 4 of the same sushi roll, to go, meaning I paid full price. My boyfriend picked up the order and when I checked to see if it was right this time, it was completely different! I thought they gave me the wrong sushi but turns out they got a new chef who makes it differently. Told my boyfriend to go get his money back but he talked me into keeping it. The sushi tasted completely different, didn't even finish all 4 of the rolls. The most irritating part about it is that Osaka doesn't even warn you when they make these new changes. No reason to return to Osaka now that my favorite sushi has been ruined. Only a matter of time until they close down."}
{"text":"There has been a remarkable amount of turnover, it has definitely effected the atmosphere of the restaurant. Service is still great, but the food quality has suffered and prices are higher."}
{"text":"I have not tried Teppanyaki but this is a reliable spot for solid sushi. Whether I go during lunch, happy hour, or regular dinner this place has yet to disappoint. I have also tried a variety of their rolls and they've been great. Some of their spicy rolls definitely bring the heat! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick bite of quality sushi, which can be hard to find in AZ!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 14 people at 7:00 but unfortunately 2 of our party were running about 20 minutes late. We asked to be seated but the very rude hostess said we couldn't be seated until all 14 were there because the server had to put all of the food orders in at the same time. I asked if we could be seated so we could order drinks and she said if you want drinks you can go to the bar. Assuming the male next to her was a host, we asked for his assistance but he said we'd have to wait even though our table was set up. Turns out he said he was the manager but not a good one. We were celebrating a birthday and probably could had a round or 2 of drinks but didn't happen. The server was okay when we could track him down and the cook was pretty good.  Food was so so. While leaving I asked for the manager's business card, the \"host\" said he was the manager. Asked for the name and number of the owner but was told he doesn't come around much!  The $500 we spent would have been much better at another restaurant.  Will never go back to these rude people again!"}
{"text":"Awful awful experience!!! Made a reservation for two at a teppanyaki table and still had to wait over thirty minutes to be seated after reservation time. It was also extremely smokey inside, seems like they don't have the correct ventilation for how many grills are in there. Once seated it took over fifteen minutes to receive service/drinks. Ordered the Hamachi Kama to start and it was not cooked all the way through, colorless and thickly coated in cayenne pepper (traditionally served with lemon, ponzu and black pepper). Soon after we then ordered our meal, I ordered the shrimp and scallops teppan & my friend ordered filet mignon and lobster. When the chef started cooking he messed up every trick he attempted and then gave up and just started grilling the vegetables. Then while in mid conversation I was hit in the eyelid with a hot piece of zucchini by the chef who then laughed and continued to hit other people, including a young girl, in their faces with food to the point where they were all hiding behind their napkins and VERY uncomfortable. At this point we are very confused what just happened! So I thought it was over but next, as I was talking to my friend, sake starts being sprayed into my mouth with NO WARNING. I am so surprised that it starts flowing down my face & my shirt which is now wet. Usually, I would love to drink sake in a fun way like that, but with a warning. Chef continues laughing, I am not amused for the fact that I was on antibiotics and was the one driving that night. Which also happened to be a Friday, NOT SAFE OSAKA! Food was done soon after, was bland and the sauces they were prepared on were not what was listed as what they come with on the menu. Put all my food in a box and ended up tossing it :( So at the end of the day, awful service, awful food and VERY bad experience. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I had in a very long time. We went during happy hour and left feeling good and full. This is my new spot now. Quality food. I didn't think az had good sushi with us being from CA"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Nothing really revolutionary, but consistent service.  Great happy hour and lunch prices.  Dinner portions are 3-4 serving sizes.  Lunch sizes are 1 - 1/2 serving size.  Don't order from the kid's menu as the pricing per portion size are not as good a deal.  I visit 2-3 times a month usually during lunch and happy hour.  The place is busy, but I normally don't have to wait.  On Sundays, the wait is five to ten minutes.  TLD;R - Food and service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Wanted to treat visiting granddaughter to japanese teppanaki meal.  She had been to Benihana's in Scottsdale and while we had a good experience there, I wanted to surprise her with a new place. Spent over an hour checking out Yelp reviews and came up with Osaka in Mesa.  Had fairly good reviews and a nice drive never hurt anybody.  So instead of driving 5 miles to Benihana, I drove 20 miles to Osaka.    Environment:  Osaka is less dingy, more brightly lit and cleaner than Benihana.  The Soup:  Miso type soup with mushrooms.  It was more of a holograph of mushrooms.  Not bad tasting but not good either.  Not hot, lukewarm.  Benihana wins on their wonderful hot soup.   Salad:  Iceberg lettuce, one grape tomato, one slice of cucumber.  About the same size as Benihana's but Benihana's ginger dressing is delicious.  Osaka's dressing does not have a flavorful ginger dressing.  Kind of blah.   Condiments/Sauces:  Benihana serves a wonderful, strong mustardy sauce along with a ginger based sauce.  Osaka served a Ranch dressing type of sauce and a diluted, sweet ginger sauce.  Benihana wins.    Food Preparation:  Osaka seems to be off on the order in which food is prepared.  Fried Rice was done first so everyone had fried rice on their plates.  One couple who had a toddler with them ( parents paid for a kiddie meal which I will never understand why), ended up with a portion of fried rice which was twice the size of my teenage granddaughter's portion.  Literally.  Does that make sense?   The chef  then put on the meats, fish and shrimp.  Cooked steak for those who ordered steak and served it to them.  My granddaughter who specifically asked for \"bloody\" and emphasized rare steak, ended up with medium to medium-well steak.  Does one send steak back at a Teppanaki table service?  I wanted to but my granddaughter did not want to create a fuss.  What a nice temperament.  I would not have been so nice.  So now everyone has fried rice and steak on their plate and I have only fried rice and the shrimp entree I ordered has not been served to me.  The shrimp are sitting on the grill while the chef does a few tricks including cleaning portions of the grill which had scallop residue on it.  Yes, please, go ahead and clean your grill.  I can wait some more.  I can graze on the fried rice and the ridiculous sauces you served with it.  I asked him if I was ever going to get my shrimp. And suddenly a light bulb went off and he realized I was the only one with just rice.  So I am served my shrimp but only after everyone got their 2 shrimp appetizer on their plates first.  Did I say appetizer?  Doesn't an appetizer come first such as before the fried rice which was getting cold on our plates while the chef did his endless number of tricks??? I'm for the tricks don't get me wrong.  I'm no scrooge.  But you can't keep me from having anything substantive on my plate while you do your tricks and everybody else is eating their fried rice and steak.  He finally puts shrimp on my plate.  Hot shrimp, cold fried rice.  Oh, did I forget to tell you that the veggies haven't been prepared yet?  Oh, yeah. Go ahead.  Serve the vegetables at the end.  Alone.  After we have eaten our rice and protein.  Are vegetables a dessert so that's why they are served at the end and served  Overdone like mush?.  Benihana knows how to present food in such an order that everyone is eating their dish at the same time.  They serve the soup, salad, then the standard shrimp appetizer, veggies (while the meat/fish is cooking) and fried rice.  All lovely like a ballet.  No ballet at Osaka, more like breakdance on the D train in NYC."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time last night. They were pretty empty inside. We ordered 4 different sushi rolls, Las Vegas roll (usually my favorite roll, this place's roll was slightly smaller than others I've tried but was still very good!), the Golden Sunshine roll (couldn't believe how good it was!), a yellowtail roll (my husband's...said it was pretty good) and also a spicy tuna roll (my husband loved). Overall, the food was really delicious! The service was a little slow but still very good. This place definitely will be our new go to spot for sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the arrowhead area... wow. Please try this place... I have not tried the teppanyaki but I was absolutely blown away by the sushi. They use black rice which is better quality and healthier... get It!"}
{"text":"Birthday Celebration last night for our grandsons 4th. Waitress argued with me about when to put our dinner order in.  We did order 4 platters of sushi and did not want to Chef starting to cook 3 minutes after the sushi arrived.  Waitress could not understand why I wanted the Chef to wait a bit. Told me he was on a strict schedule and must begin as per his schedule.After we finished the sushi I requested a clean plate, Waitress made a face and threw my soup bowl spilling the contents on the table.  Called for the Manager  Got NO WHERE with him.  Done  Will never spend a penny here again.   If there were only 0 Stars"}
{"text":"Coming from California a year ago we searched far and wide for a good sushi place. From Peoria to Phoenix. From Goodyear to Surprise. We found it! The Osaka roll is the best roll my wife and I've ever had. Coming for us that's big, because we are kinda Sushi snobs, lol. The Sushi chefs are absolutely great! Not only is the sushi outstanding but their presentation is second to none! I was blow away with their attention to detail and care they put into it. Everything I see coming out from behind the sushi bar is masterful. Try this place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was awful.  The spicy tuna roll is made of something I can't even identify.  This was absolutely terrible quality the yellow tale tuna tasted old and smelled.  Even the cucumber salad wasn't good, I mean how do you mess up cucumber salad.  I would avoid this place as there are many better places such as Smokin Fins, or Rau."}
{"text":"Very good.  Consistent.    Good sushi.   Nice presentation.  Second dinner this trip.   Totally dufferent.  Terrible host staff.    Manager was even worse.   They do not care about taking care of the customer.   We Would have consistently came in the future.   Now we will need to find a new Japaneese restaurant option   If you like to be treated appropriately Dont stop here"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was great! Didn't do teppanyaki for our first time but still had great food. We got in at 5pm and the lady still offered us happy hour even though it ended at 5. The Pinapple mojitos were amazing! Also HIGHLY recommend the garlic edamame that comes with their house made garlic sauce, that was my favorite part of dinner. Also got teriyaki chicken which was also good."}
{"text":"Sushi was great... but the purple rice is a little strange. Also they forgot my son's food abd kept saying it would be out soon, it finally came oit about 10 minutes after the rest of the table was done eating. The manager never bothered to come over to apologize AND the server still charged us for his plate. We will not be rerurning."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were craving sushi so we gave this place a try since it was so close to where I live. From the outside, the restaurant did not look so pleasing. It looks very run down and had a fishy odor.  But once inside, the restaurant and atmosphere was very nice. We got seated right away because we only came for sushi and not the Tepanakki.   The house salad with ginger dressing is not worth the 2 dollars even though it's only 2 dollars, save your money and calories. The salad was just iceberg with a slice of cucumber and a slice of very old tomato; the iceberg was very cold making the whole thing unpleasant.  Everything else we ordered was pretty decent.  -Calamari: came out hot and crispy.  -Nigiri: looked fresh (was the boyfriends, he thought it was okay, even though these pieces were bigger here, he prefers the one from Kabuki). -Eel and avocado roll was way too barbaque-y? And not enough eel -Spicy tuna: did not enjoy this as much as I should have but I can't pinpoint why.  -Soft shell crab: way too sweet  AND if you check in on Yelp you get a free tempura ice cream if you spend over 25 dollars... SCORE!   But don't get too excited because the breading on the tempura ice cream was thick and just falls away from the ice cream, so instead of getting this melt in your mouth feeling you get grittiness that leaves you dissatisfied.   I would definitely return to try out the Tepanakki part of this restaurant but I guess the hunt to find a good sushi restaurant in East Mesa is still on."}
{"text":"We Enjoy going here for happy hour! Its a nice place for a great drink and really a little of everything on the menu for happy hour.I have never had bad customer service ..all in all a friendly place ."}
{"text":"Food at Osaka is absolutely delicious. Our experience this time around was less than good. Waited 25 minutes for our drinks. Never got water. Server came over maybe once. She made the experience bad however we would still go back because the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Overall, very good experience here. We usually go to Benni Hanna but decided to try Osaka after our good friends recommended it. The food was excellent and the portions huge. The service was standard. We will definitely go there again and bring friends."}
{"text":"Awesome! Will definitely be back! We did the   Teppanyaki for my daughter's birthday. Great atmosphere and excellent food. The reason I gave 4 stars is the drinks are only so so. We had several kinds amongst our table and they only tasted ok, were weak, come in a plastic soda glass, and there is no draft beer."}
{"text":"My review is a little delayed. My husband and I came here for a Valentine's date based on Yelp reviews. We loved it! Specialty rolls are huge, non specialty rolls are dinky. I would pass on the spicy tuna, salmon, etc and just order from the specialty menu. We loved the fat boy roll. You have to eat it in two bites but it was delicious! We also ordered a dinner box which came with pot stickers, fried veggies/shrimp, rice, soup, meat, and a California roll. The California roll was definitely better than the spicy tuna roll we ordered. Prices are pretty standard, but I would say the quality is above standard! Loved this place."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out with the family the other day during happy hour at the recommendation of many people. We were able to order multiple appetizers as well as order four specialty rolls and drinks and our tab was around $50 for a party of five. Highly recommend the crab jalape√±o poppers as they are huge and the Godzilla roll is amazing! We also ordered the Mesa roll, fried shumai and calamari, all of which were good. Service was a little slow but I think it has to do with heavier crowds than normal due to the holidays. The place was clean and okay for kids. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  They fit us in on valentines when they were packed.  We had a great time and the food was amazing.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place great food.  The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it especially the happy hours."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fresh. Reminds me of home (Hawaii) flavors. Great service from staff. Seems to be an excellent spot for birthday celebrations too. Portions were HUGE and prices were reasonable. Recommend this place for family and/or friend night."}
{"text":"I've been to the place 3 times, the first 2 were for family birthday parties.  The teppanyaki dinner is fun to do with the family especially with the nieces and nephews in tow.  The 3rd time I visited the place was to try the sushi.  I must say the sushi was prepared rather well and the happy hour prices made it all that much better.  Compared to some of the other sushi establishments I would say this place does a good job of still providing their better rolls during happy hour.  If you're going with a group/family then definitely try the teppanyaki otherwise I would definitely recommend choosing from the normal menu.  Of course if you can make it on time then aim for the happy hour, it's a very good value."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Jackie was the life of the party the best entertainment we have found at a hibachi. We will for sure go back here."}
{"text":"This is mine and my colleagues fave HH spot! Their happy hour is awesome and the drinks are yumm ( at least the two kinds I have ordered ahha)  But yes! I've always wanted to try this place and finally tried and love it!  Happy hour prices are pretty good and service is super friendly... It does take a while for my food to go out... Or am I just super impatient? Lol I am always starving when I come here..  Anyways... Sushi is great and taste fresh.. Pretty good flavor.. Today I ordered Rainbow roll $6( my fave) and ocean roll $8 (yumm)! Inlove that their sushi rice is not super thick so I don't get super full.. I finished two rolls with no problem!  I wanna try the other ones when I come back too... Maybe time to try their Vegas next time...  The drink I had today was yummy too and it was only 5 bucks! It's called Katana - coconut rum pineapple juice and melon liquer  Anyways... I can't wait for the next get together here!    Def gotta remember the checkin offer coz the pics on here makes it look bomb!!!  Free ice cream at check in!"}
{"text":"Fun and reasonably priced dinner.  Teppenyaki chef was great and the amount you are served is more than enough. Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable.  They were all very friendly and attentive.  The sushi is so fresh. I have only had the sushi each visit.  My sister and I loved it and have been back already twice more.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for sushi, appetizers and drinks. Across the street from the movie theater ( Harkins Arrowhead 18) quick stop in.  They have an all day happy hour menu with great rolls. Surprised with the size and quality of sushi for \"all day happy hour\". Better than most other places on their best day.  Keep it up and you've got a lifer"}
{"text":"This place from beginning to end is amazing. We came here for my daughter's 16th Birthday and they made her so happy. They have fantastic customer service, great food,  and an awesome atmosphere. So clean!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with this place but my gf and her family love this place. For me once I've seen the show I've seen it a thousand times and it is old. Of course, the kids love the show and love the [irritating] birthday song of which they will sing every day until the next birthday that is held there.   I have tried the grill and the sushi and neither has truly impressed me. The grill is hit or miss and probably depends on the chef and how much seasoning they put on the food. The sushi was OK but a bit on the expensive side. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had come starving instead of arriving already content. Normally I will eat 3-4 rolls and this time I couldn't even eat two - the rolls are the larger diameter rolls BTW.  The servers do keep your glasses full and are poignant on checking on you without being annoying. This is a big kudos to me as this is a fine balance of feeling forgotten and feeling annoyed.  I judge for what it is worth and this is a place for parties, not gourmet food served under candlelight. Chances are you will hear that annoying birthday song and see someone running around with an paper-mache Asian-face helmet on - that is just how it goes. It is good for this but I do dearly hope on a regular basis that the GFs family picks something different for the next birthday because going there every month is too much for me."}
{"text":"Recently, their service has been pretty bad. After seated, I would have to wait 10+ minutes for anyone to show up. When I need to order more food or a refill on drinks, there's no one to call over."}
{"text":"If half stars were an option, I'd give 3.5. Hubby and I stopped in on a Thursday night and it was busier than we expected...and by the time we left, they had a wait. As others have mentioned, more than half of the restaurant is dedicated to teppenyaki. There are four or five booths in the bar area and then some seating at the sushi bar. Overall, I think the space is poorly designed. Luckily we didn't have to wait long for a booth and all of the staff was super friendly. We had the potstickers and crab puffs to start...for the portion size, I thought they were a little overpriced, but both tasty. Especially the crab puffs - crispy with a decadent cream cheese and crab filling. The entrees were definitely a great value!  I had the curry pork katsu and hubby had the teriyaki steak box. His came with a full size California roll and vegetable/shrimp tempura. All the food was good, but not spectacular. I also thought it took a little too long to get our food considering the kitchen only had to worry about the diners in the booths. We may be back to check out the teppenyaki side!"}
{"text":"I was new to this part of the valley and wanted some real Korean BBQ and discovered Osaka! I am sorry that there are only three stars... the Korean BBQ itself is very very yummy! However, the customer service was not unfortunately. The people that worked there were not that friendly and the vibe/ambiance was not good at least for me. Good Korean BBQ but not the nicest of people :/"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the bento box dinner with salmon. First time it came out with chicken instead of salmon but they fixed the issue. Came here for dinner Saturday night with my boyfriend. We tried the quail egg and oyster shot. It gave me food poisoning that took me to the ER. I emailed them and they never got back to me about a refund for my meal..."}
{"text":"Attempted to try the teppanyaki here but the wait was one hour so we tried eating at the sushi bar for whatever was on the menu. Unfortunately the food was less than par. We ordered the Golden Spider Roll, Mango Tango Roll and Japanese Fried Rice and let's just say that I've had better. :(    Here's the details for how it all went down:  Golden Spider Roll - eel, imitation crab mixed with masago, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese, mango. The ratio of the eel (the main attraction) was about 1/10th of the roll, the imitation crab mix was an enormous 1/2 of the roll and the rest was the avocado, cream cheese and cucumber. The eel was missing out on the show. And, the  masago (which was not the normal masago I usually have) was incorporated into the imitation crab so if you're not into that crunchy poppy texture in your mouth then don't order anything with imitation crab.   Mango Tango Roll: we didn't realize that this was almost the same as the Golden Spider Roll and it was the same ratios. The main event, the soft shell crab, was hiding at a mere 1/10th of the roll- minus the ends of the roll. Those were luckily on the heartier side.   Japanese Fried Rice: should come with peas, carrots, onions, fried egg,pineapple and shrimp. When we were presented the dish it looked very very plain. There was no color to it as if it had the flu. There were maybe 5 peas on the entire dish, bits of fried egg, no carrots. Tasteless for a fried rice dish. We didn't eat much of this as we will attempt to redo it at home and cure it from its flu.   Note to us: do not come here for the sushi and entrees. I will say however the teppanyaki was lively and had a wait of an hour. The cooks seem to be energetic and the crowd was too. We heard a laughing hyena clear across the other room on multiple accounts. Their bday song was quite funny in a good way and we must've heard it 6 times in 45 minutes. So it was a crowd pleaser.   I don't think we will come back here again due to the sushi lacking the main part of the order and the tasteless flavors of the fried rice. So sorry."}
{"text":"Took my Dad and his wife here during my visit with them last weekend.  Dad had said he hadn't been to this type of restaurant since he moved to Mesa. I used Yelp to see if there was someplace close to his house and to my surprise, it was very close.  Dinner was great.  Graph to select a sake was extremely helpful.  Our chef was great entertainment and did a wonderful job.  I was not so successful catching his throws.  All the food was fresh and cooked perfectly.  No complaints.  We had varied selections of chicken, steak and seafood.  The lobster may have been a little overcooked, but too bad.  Everything was flavorful and yet not over the top.  Nothing too spicy.   Portions were very generous.  Since I was traveling, no leftovers for me. But I heard the next day the leftovers were every bit as good.  I know that Dad and his wife are already investigating lunch options looking for both a smaller meal and a little less expense."}
{"text":"This place is tasty. Reservations accepted. Fun for kids/adults. Friendly staff and most important, great tasting food.  Our teppanaki chef was great with the kids and catered to the adults as well. Everyone is trained well here.  Birthday mask is trippy, but funny.  It is reasonable priced and an overall entertaining and fun experience."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but it has slowly declined.   Service has become shit. New faces every time we come in. Language barrier with a good portion of the staff, too. Good luck trying to order an \"Asahi\"; that ends up being \"Sake\".   Quality of the sushi has fallen off, too. I would not recommend any more to anyone. Shame, since their happy hour used to a be a staple for us every Friday night."}
{"text":"The hibachi was pretty good. The sushi was pretty good too. Not anything amazing, but it's fun for a group of people. The wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi is one of my favorite foods and I thought I have found of the places worth trying. My husband and I went to see a movie at a nearby theater and were surprised to find out that the show was full and we would have to see a later show. We didn't have time to sit down at other restaurants in the area so we decided to go to Osaka and sit at the bar. The bartender was extremely friendly and placed our order right away. I wasn't expecting the food to be so good, since I had never heard anything about the place. I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a couple sushi rolls and my husband had a fried spicy tuna jalapeno appetizer. We left satisfied with plenty of time to make out movie.  My second visit was with a friend and I was equally pleased with the food! She ordered fried rice, which wasn't like any fried rice I've had and it was delicious. Looking forward to trying more new things next time!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi chefs! They were appeasing to any additional sauces or requests I had. I was able to order straight from them or my server. My favorite time of day is happy hour! They have great food and drink specials! I even tried some new items!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had (Godzilla roll). The plum wine is excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. The amount of food you get is definitely plenty of bang for your buck. I don't know how many trips it'll take to try all the sushi available, but I'm willing to keep going until i do."}
{"text":"I went here based on the Yelp reviews, which are usually perfect for me!   I was surprised at the lack of flavor.  The rolls seemed really greasy and tough.  I like rolls that are healthy, but my sister wanted to order one that was fried.  One other one did not say fried on the menu, but it looked like it had been fried.  My husband ordered the Teppan steak, and he said the meat was not tender at all.    Maybe we went on a bad night?  My favorite place is a hole in the wall at Power Rd and Main St called Sushi Kee.  We've gone to Sushi Kee for years, and they are usually wonderful.  However, on our last visit, it was just ok, so we thought we'd try a new place.  I am going to stick with Sushi Kee since usually their food is the best."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Great service and fairly priced! Definitely a must do for your birthday!"}
{"text":"I have celiac disease and therefore require gluten free which leaves out many teppanyaki places.  I was amazed by this place.  The two that i was dining with said they would eat gluten free to make it easy.    At one point my son asked for a non gluten free sauce which was served and 3 separate people in management came over to make sure this was correct.  If you have a gluten sensitivity or celiac disease I strongly suggest this place.  The food was out of this world and prepared in an entertaining fashion.  I will return there each time I visit my son in Arizona.  I felt it was an amazingly safe place to eat"}
{"text":"Not as fancy as Soporro, but makes up in price and taste!  We ordered teppan for 2, which included 4 choices of proteins.. I'm sure you could order double of 2. Anyway, we chose filet, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  You get the usual soup and salad to start. They offer you 2 sauces, both delicious! Our chef was good, not the most impressive I've ever seen, but fun and cooked our food to perfection.  Everything was wonderful! The steak was like butter! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great service, from start to finish. We were seated and given menus, we were asked how our days were going. We ordered the Osaka combo, which is basically chicken, shrimp and steak, cooked teppenyaki style. Sake bombs were involved. I made a video, but I will need to upload it later due to its immense filesize.  I also got a Sapporo beer which complemented well with the food that was served. The other guests at my table got some cocktail drinks that I took sips of that were also very good.  The onion volcano is well worth the visit and deserves a paragraph of its own. This is a Teppenyaki classic in most Teppenyaki places in the USA. It's basically where the chef cuts up an onion, layers the slices on top of each other, pours gasoline into the \"onion volcano\", and then lights it up so that it catches fire. It's well worth the visit like I said!  Now, as far as the food goes. It's good, but this is where I personally have a love-hate relationship with Teppenyaki.  \"Wait, Russell, why did you give this place five stars if you have a love-hate relationship with Teppenyaki?\"  Well, the FOOD is good. It's the sauces I have issue with. They say the white, creamy sauce is meant for seafood, and the sweeter, saltier dark sauce is meant for land meats. This is NOT standard practice in Teppenyaki places overseas outside the USA at least where I've tried. And frankly, I hate the sauces. But here's the thing, if you don't try the sauces, that's fine! The food is still good. I just wanted to make a point of it in my review; you can take it or leave it.  Finally, the desserts. They have some interesting desserts that I've had before, but I elected on a Lychee based cocktail that was delicious and in my opinion appropriate for the occasion.  Would I come back? Fuck yeah I would. I have. But I'd avoid the sauces, enjoy the show, savor the food and the drink, and the company I bring."}
{"text":"I went with my parents and the service could've been much better. When we ordered the teppan we assumed the waitress would know that it would be for all of us. She could've clarified that with us by simply asking us if we wanted to share. We ordered some sushi and the filet mignon and scallop teppan. However, she was attenttive on refilling our drinks. Sushi was pretty good for a place in Arizona. However the teppan was terrible. Our chef made it so salty! I couldn't have more than a couple bites. I don't know about you, but I don't like to be annoyed by overenthusiastic chefs or servers when I'm trying to eat. Honestly, the chef put more effort into putting on a show than cooking the food.; which annoyed me to no end. Also, if you still go here after reading my review watch out because you might slip on some broccoli the chef dropped while trying to toss it into a diner's mouth for more tip. The restrooms are clean though. Put more effort on cooking and serving your customers than a show. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at this location a few times now. We have enjoyed the food and the service. I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for teppanyaki.  The fried rice is so good it has ruined all other fried rice for me.  Our kids love the food and the happy birthday song that plays every 20 minutes or so - and kids eat free on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and first time ever having teppanyaki. I was super excited about trying this out. I got the steak and shrimp entree and it could have not been more perfect. Our cook was great at entertaining us while still cooking our foods to perfection! We had a large party of about 25 people and our food was made in a timely manner. Service from waiter/waitress was really good as well. I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"this place was awesome it was too busy to eat at the teppenyaki section but the atmosphere was still awesome. it was a bit loud which was perfect for our kids since they are noisy. We had delicious seared ahi tuna for an app, my wife ordered a sushi roll and octopus salad Yumm Yumm it was so delicious. I had the sashimi dinner box which was filled with all the wonders of Japan. Service was good for how busy it was (it was filled to capacity with a lot of people waiting to be seated). I will definitely return and make a reservation next time. I can still taste the awesome sushi!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic.  Our waiter was on top of his game.  The Tempura is incredible.  You can't miss regardless of what you order that's Tempura.  We had the filet mignon and lobster Teppan Yaki and it was great.  Tender with a great teriyaki sauce, house fried rice was excellent that came with it along with the mushroom soup and salad. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really everything was great here except for the waitress.  A party of 5 of us stopped by for dinner on Memorial Day and got Lori as our server. She was almost snotty to us,  and was apparently having a bad day. She took our order, brought our drinks, threw our salads at us and disappeared.  The chef came out at that point and was wonderful. He prepared wonderful food and was very entertaining. At some point during dinner, our drinks ran out but no Lori. She disappeared. Finally, after all the food was gone I caught Lori wandering around the rear of the restaurant and motioned for her.  She came over and asked if everything was ok. I told her we would have liked refills on our drinks. She told me she could get us drinks to go, I told her we would have liked drinks during dinner. She told us \"You ordered so many appetizers.\"  What? We ordered two tempura rolls. So that prevented her from refilling our iced teas?  The food and chef we're wonderful, the waitress not so much."}
{"text":"My family and friends came here for a birthday celebration. We were blown away by how amazing our chef was. The shrimp was hands down the best. The steak and chicken were juicy and cooked to perfection. Our chef made it very fun for our 7 year old twins.  The birthday song with drums and masks had us all cracking up. We will be returning again and again.   The only mishap was We did not like the young men bartending. Millennials think a tip is automatic even when shitty service is given.  TIPS= To Insure Prompt Service"}
{"text":"Came here for a Birthday dinner. The performance by our Chef was entertaining and the filet and shrimp were outstanding. They also have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service. Everything came out delicious! We loved that you can choose to be seated at a booth rather than in front of the grill for teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun night. The experience was fun and the service was great. The chef (Gary) gave us a really well done performance and was constantly keeping the interaction going. The mushroom soup was really delicious and comforting. The fried rice was excellent and the food overall was great. We shared the Ocean Trio of scallops, lobster and shrimp.  The Spicy Girl roll is definitely a recommendation as well. Overall I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place today - and I'm so glad I did! First, props to who designed the inside. So smart to have the casual /romantic diner separate from the tepenyaki tables. Those at the bar get to enjoy the show without the heat . The sushi bar is off in the back - really great layout.   So the food - freaking amazing! I got the Japanese fried rice (sans pineapple and corn) and I was instantly brought back to Okinawa.  So good that I got another order to go so I can have it for lunch tomorrow!   My husband had the sushi lunch where the chef picks five pieces of sushi. He loved it! Service was super!! We came for lunch and we'll be back for dinner!!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite sushi restaurant! The rolls are HUGE! We always order the rockstar, Las Vegas and try another different roll each time. Definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"Plenty of food for the money. Did the hibachi and it was entertaining. Wasn't busy so we had to wait for more people to sit in order for the cooking to start. Meanwhile the sushi called Lisa Lisa was great and the drink called scorpion bowl was lit on fire for us to drink. The only bad part was they played unedited rap music and we had to inform them that  children were nearby and they changed to Christmas music. The music selection in general was odd choice either way. Overall would return and try the regular restaurant side."}
{"text":"Honestly for this random sushi spot by Harkins its really good. We ordered a lot of sushi of all kinds mostly the ones with the most popular sign next to them. Prices are high for this hidden location and it was pretty good just sucks because some of the workers don't even know English so it's useless to ask them for a fork when they go running to another worker. Place is cool."}
{"text":"Had a friend grab me some sushi to-go (citrus roll and spicy tuna) It was super fresh with lots of flavor! I would definitely order here again."}
{"text":"Came to have happy hour with my niece, and sat down for 30 minutes and no one greeted us once! No water no nothing and all the serves were just passing by us. This was the worst service ever! Finally got a sever after having to ask for some service. I ordered a cocktail and he told me he doesn't know how make it therefore he can't make it for me?? I have never had such bad service!"}
{"text":"the food was really good.  tasted great.  but the service was veeerrrrryyy sssslllloooowwww. again if you have time the food was great. but if you're looking at getting in and out in an hour. it won't happen."}
{"text":"Firstly, although I read a lot of restaurant reviews, I have never felt the urge to write one... until now.  My bride and I happened to be staying overnight in the hotel adjacent to the Osaka Japanese Steakhouse, Sushi, & Bar.  Coincidentally, it happened to be our 29th wedding anniversary.  (My wife had to fly out of Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport early the following morning; we occasionally drive to Mesa from Tucson to take advantage of Allegiant flights.)  We observed this restaurant's sign as we drove into the hotel parking lot.  My wife, who wouldn't eat sushi if her life depended on it - although she does enjoy Teppanyaki cooking, remarked that it might be a good place to enjoy an anniversary dinner.  (We've had many a Teppanyaki \"show & dinner\" over the years - in California, Arizona, & Montana, to name a few... and I've recently become a real sushi aficionado.)  Upon asking our hotel desk clerk for a dining recommendation for a special dinner at a good restaurant within a 5-mile radius of the hotel, we were given the names of a half-dozen or so restaurants.  We then specifically asked about the Japanese restaurant next door.  The clerk said she didn't know from personal experience because the restaurant had only been open since July 5th, but that she'd heard good things from a few hotel guests.  So... we took a chance, and ended up enjoying one of the best dinners of our lives!  We walked across the hotel parking lot, and upon entering Osaka; we were greeted by a smiling, affable hostess who seated us, by request, at a Teppan table.  We told her we were celebrating our anniversary.  She told us that she would also be our waitress, and said that because they were still celebrating their \"grand opening,\" we could take advantage of a complimentary 12-ounce beer of our choice with the order of any entree.  In addition, she said that all appetizers on the menu were half-price.  My wife, who totally abstains from all alcoholic beverages, but thankfully doesn't mind at all that her hubby imbibes on a very regular basis, promptly asked, \"What kind of beer would you like, Sweetie?\"  I said I'd have a Sapporo, and she said, \"I think I'll order one, too, that way YOU can enjoy a couple of 'em!\"  (Now you know why I've been married to this angel for 29 years!)  Our personable waitress, named Elaina, gave us both a wink and a smile!  For appetizers, I ordered Edamame (sea-salted, steamed soybeans served in the pod); my better half ordered Gyoza (Japanese potstickers/dumplings filled with pork & vegetables).  They were served promptly, along with \"our\" beers in frosted mugs.  I also ordered a Traditional Yellowtail Roll (Negihama) as a prelude to dinner, because I wanted to compare with the various sushi joints I've been frequenting in Tucson.  Both appetizers, along with the sushi roll, were outstanding treats.  Oh, and each of us consumed a bowl of Mushroom Soup (clear chicken broth with mushrooms & fried onion) and House Salad (lettuce, cucumber, & tomato served with a homemade ginger dressing - which tasted a lot like regular Thousand Island dressing to me.)  The soup and salad, of course, are served as a part of a Teppanyaki entree order.  Then, even though we were already pretty full of food, the highlight of our meal really began.  Our chef, named Darryl, cooked our Teppanyaki entrees.  My wife had the Filet Mignon (ordered medium-well) & Chicken combo; I had the Filet Mignon (ordered very rare) & Shrimp combo.  Darryl not only cooked our entrees to perfection, but he was quite entertaining.  He provided a truly delightful show.  Methinks he would delight children of all ages!  My wife and I commented how much our sons (one college aged, one high-school aged) would have enjoyed the dinner and \"show.\"  Our entrees were absolutely scrumptious, but we could only eat about half of them, since we were so full.  (I brought the leftovers back home to my boys the following day - they just loved & destroyed 'em!)  To conclude our meal, Elaina simply wouldn't let us leave without serving us a complimentary order of tempura-battered ice cream (which I don't believe is even on the menu) to share in celebration of our anniversary.  It, too, was luscious.  And before we left, Darryl came from the kitchen area to the dining room again - just to wish us a happy anniversary.  When we told him how much we had enjoyed dinner, he asked us our names, saying that he likes to learn the names of his special customers.  Talk about making a pair feel good about their dining experience!  All in all, my wife and I agree that this was one of the most \"special\" dinners we've ever had.  Before tax and gratuities, our bill was $60.50 - not inexpensive, but relatively nothin' when compared to other \"special\" dinners.  Would we go back?  Oh yes - again and again!  The next time we're in the Phoenix metro area, whether it is for the next D-backs series we attend or the next Allegiant flight we schedule, you can bet that we will be back"}
{"text":"I was never a true Sushi fan...until now.  Wow!  Treated by friends as a birthday gift and it was marvelous.  The Osaka Roll, Pink Lady roll and Tuna pizza were standouts, with subtle yet distinctive fresh flavors.  And the honey eel sauce was to die for.  Topped of with cold sweet Sake, it was an event meal of the highest caliber.  As a California ex-pat, who would of thought of that in AZ!"}
{"text":"I loved the saki shots and I am not complaining.... however.... they should card some people because I was told I looked 18 and then I got a 30 second sake shot!  It was delicious, but still, they should be careful.    Make sure you make reservations and maybe get an appetizer. For some reason the soup and salad and meal didn't fill me up.. Birthday paqrties were kind of annoying, but we had a great time!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened and love the food. It does get rather loud later at night so if you want quite and casual come in the afternoon. Group parties are better at night for the hibachi grills. My wife loves the California rolls and the tempura veggies are my go to favorite."}
{"text":"Go here for happy hour! New items on the menu all the time, and are reasonabley priced for happy hour."}
{"text":"As far as Japanese Hibachi steakhouses go, this place was pretty decent.  Wasn't the best I've been to, but definitely not the worst.  Prices seemed about on par with most other of these places.  Food was cooked well and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Osaka because we had never been to a Japanese hibachi place where they cook the meal in front of you. It was definitely an experience I'll never forget!   The food was delicious, even the veggies. I had the chicken and steak, and it was cooked to perfection. Even the fried rice was excellent!  The only odd thing about this place is that even though we were there in the middle of the lunch hour, there was no one else in the room with us despite the fact that there were about 20 grilling stations. There is seating in the front room for people who order the \"regular\" food (without the show), but when we walked out there were only about 3 people in there. Maybe we caught them on a very slow day, but it was a bit odd to have such a small crowd for lunch.  I give Osaka four stars because the food was great, but the prices are kind of high. The bill for four people was over $200, but we did have a few pina coladas as well."}
{"text":"Lots of fun. Great food and wonderful company'.  Would recommend this restaurant to all. It's a little far from us, but well worth the drive.  We've tried other Japanese restaurants and by far Osaka is the best.  Make sure you make reservations. It's always crowded."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Went here for my birthday, be sure to sign up for their VIP to get your birthday treat. I personally think this is the best teppan. place in the valley. The quality of the food was outstanding, the chef was so much fun and made sure we had plenty of sake! I love the birthday song, although it seems like a popular spot for birthdays because you hear it just about every 10 minutes, despite that the whole restaurant is engaged and having fun. Can't wait to go back and do it again. By the way, our party ordered steak, shrimp, scallops, lobster, and fish...every single dish was incredible with a ton of flavor (the scallops were my favorite!)"}
{"text":"Osaka is a Japanese Steakhouse that is a novelty for those who have never experienced the teppanyaki table. So, if you have never been to one, it is fun to take the family or guests. Having said that, we have experienced better tables in other states.  We ordered the New York Strip Steak, a teriyaki chicken and a Sushi Dinner Box without shrimp. Our server was not very attentive. There were several mistakes during our meal: the teppanyaki dinner meals came with mushroom broth, but the dinner box was supposed to come with a miso soup. She brought three mushroom soups instead. We asked her to replace it. Then, our Nigiri sushi had shrimp, but she returned with the correct Nigiri after that. She also hardly checked on our table.  The best parts of our meals were the soya dressing in our salad. The New York Strip Steak was cooked with just the perfect amount of seasoning. We also enjoyed the balanced fried rice. We liked the purple royal rice in our California Roll.  The teriyaki chicken was doused in too much sauce as were the vegetables although the chef was kind enough to caramelize the veggies as we requested. The sushi was okay. The tempura vegetables and shrimp did not come with tempura dipping sauce.   Our table mates were lovely."}
{"text":"Partner in crime and I were craving sushi in this part of the valley, so after referring to my Yelpy app, we roll into this nearby joynt for a bite and a drink.  Corey was our server.  He was awesome.  Nice, cool and hip looking place.  Obnoxiously loud frat like ambiance in teppanyaki area.  And we wonder why people in other countries don't like loud Americans.  These tables were out of control, clearly starving for attention with every hoot, holler and guzzle of cheap booze. We ordered the garlic green beans, which, although they looked delicious when presented, were totally insipid of any flavor whatsoever. The farm raised gringo nigiri was average at best, but definitely not worth the price, or the taste buds.  We agreed that we wouldn't come back again.  As far as I'm concerned, Sakana is still the best sushi that I know of in the USA.  Good times in the Sonoran desert."}
{"text":"My daughter loves Benihana for her birthday dinner; but after last years dinner no more Benihana. What a disaster!! I decided to bring her to Osaka for her birthday dinner this year & greatly impressed!! We had Teppanyaki. The cook was fun!! He made us all laugh!! Service was excellent!! The food was hot & yummy!! After dinner they brought out my daughter's cake with candles lit!! We weren't rushed to leave & were able to enjoy opening gifts & eating birthday cake!! Thank you for the wonderful experience!! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical after reading some of the reviews on yelp and Google. We got to the restaurant and not many people were there. We went there for a 15-year-old's birthday party. We were a party of 10 and only a few of us had ever been to a teppanyaki grill before.  The food was amazing. Everyone loved it. It was extremely good. The service was slow, but we were in no hurry. The chef was great. He kept us entertained and made us laugh. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I gave three stars because the food was great, but service in the bar booths was poor. We finished our drinks, and finally had to stand up and flag the waiter to come take our order who was busy showing his tattoos to guests at the bar. Pretty exasperating..."}
{"text":"It is a family tradition to come here every Christmas Eve for dinner. The best Teppanyaki restaurant I've been to and they never disappoint.  Worth the price and the experience is amazing."}
{"text":"My son brought me here for an early dinner date at around 4:30ish and wow you sure do get a lot of food for dinner!! The soup and salad were super fresh. The rock shrimp appetizer was delicious and crunchy. You get a large portion of rice and veggies with dinner that is great tasting, but a tad salty. The Filet and shrimp is the way to go and priced fair. The waitress was so nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Osaka is O-Sucka.. made a reservation for 7 p.m., was told to wait a few minutes at the bar so we ordered drinks...at which point I told the bartender to please not wipe off the beer mug with his hand like his partner was doing, to which he replied that he uses a rag, to which I asked that he draw the beer neatly and let it \"drain\" on the napkin, pluuuuueze! Sanitation 101, no? At 7:35 after we asked what was going on, we were told that we would have to wait a couple more minutes but they be happy to  seat us in a few. I noticed that there was a large party that was buying expensive drinks and shots at the bar, who is getting all the attention. When the maitre d ask us about a reservation he was very apologetic except to say that there wasn't a place for us. If we could just possibly wait a few more minutes we might have a table. When he asked if we would like another drink I said sure if it's on the house he said that was against corporate policy, I said what about an appetizer for our wait he said he would have to talk to the owner. At that point we closed out our bar bill and left and let them know they would not be receiving a good recommendation from us on any of the websites. To which he responded that we were being rude. By, Chef Jill"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to try Osaka for our weekly date night. Based on a fellow yelpers pictures and review. We love sushi and have gotten tired of our other sushi place. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered two of the playboy rolls I asked for them both to be extra spicy, it was delicious! My husband then ordered the citrus roll and I ordered the tequila roll. The tequila tasted similar to the playboy so next time I will try a different roll. Still good though! The citrus was very good as well. The chef made us something special which was sliced peppered ahi ( on the house) oh my yum it was good! We also ordered octopus, white tuna, and albacore nigiri and again we were not disappointed. The fish was all very fresh and dressed perfectly! Presentation was beautiful. We loved our server which was a tall white gentlemen, wish I got his name. Beer was served in a chilled glass ( which I love). We tried the shumai appetizer which were good but could have been bigger dumplings, for 5 bucks I can't complain too much. I wouldn't mind trying the teppanyaki side but I don't want to be disappointed with my choice since the sushi was delicious. All in all it was a great experience we will be back soon."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi restaurant. The Texas roll is amazing! Great lunch specials and awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party. We made reservations (8 pm) and showed up with our entire party an hour early (7pm). We didn't get seated until 845pm.  We sat for 20 minutes before anyone even came over to take our drink orders.  The only highlight was our chef who when he showed up tried to be entertaining.  I will not be returning and will not be recommending anyone go."}
{"text":"It would be nice if they told you about Happy Hour when you come in during those hours. It would be nice if the manager did ANYTHING besides sit behind the register staring at nothing. It would be nice if the food came out in under 20 minutes WITHOUT a hair on it. It would be nice if they seasoned the food a bit. $50 for a below average sushi experience....no thanks. No recommendation from me!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 yakisobas and 2 sushi rolls. The yakisobas made it out in about 10 minutes. The rolls took a lot longer. About half an hour after the kids were into their yakisobas I asked one of the hostesses for my waitress. The hostess said she was busy taking another customer's order. Ok, thank you. She checked on our rolls for us and came back to say the sushi counter was backed up. Really? We've been sitting for almost 45 minutes and no sushi rolls were coming to our table! There was about 30% restaurant capacity - not a busy night. So, after she left me stewing about the lack of urgency to address the situation, I walked up to the front and asked for a manager. Sorry, sir, there's no manager on duty! WHAT?!! The hostess, who was at least somewhat attentive and concerned offered to discount our rolls 15%. Just the rolls? What about blowing the entire experience for your customer, and causing me to lose my appetite? And to fan the flames of my discontent even higher, the couple next to us who showed up and ordered after us get their rolls & meals with no issues! By the time our rolls came to the table, the couple next to us were cashed out and leaving the restaurant!!! I used to be a fan... No more. A 15% discount on my rolls won't bring me back! Poor customer service and the negligence of staff & management are going to seriously tarnish your reputation as a place of business! I hope the manager and owner of this establishment pays closer attention to reviews like this because when the paid staff fails to deliver, it is usually a direct reflection of a poorly managed business. A negligent business does NOT deserve to be in business. Don't eat here...go around the complex to Koi Sushi instead!"}
{"text":"The fried rice is out of this world and the show is so fun! Great food and great atmosphere! I highly recommend the sea scallops, they were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Really terrible that my husband and I come here often and they've just ruined that tonight. They screwed up my order, which wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact at we live 25 minutes away. They wouldn't comp the roll but offered us a free roll. Not worth the trouble of going back. When I told them we live 20 minutes away they said they'd give us $5 for next time we came in. The roll was $8. Pretty stingy, but they've lost a customer. Too bad."}
{"text":"While visiting family for the holiday my niece convinced us to eat here. We sat at the teppanyaki table. It was about the same as any other restaurant of this style - volcano, choo-choo, flip food into the mouth of the diners, egg roll, whatever. I ordered some serviceable nigiri and a vegetable yakisoba. People were nice. It was all fairly standard, though what peaked my interest was how the menu went a little further beyond other restaurants of this type, offering things like curry rice, katsu, and a variety of creative appetizers that offer interesting spins on more common dishes.  At the behest of my niece I ate at Osaka AGAIN the very next day, so I got a chance to explore a little bit more. There was a tuna nacho dish that had ahi tuna topped with a tomato-based salsa thing that wasn't great, but I was a real fan of the cucumber salad, a hefty serving of cucumbers tossed in a simple ponzu sauce. Altogether there was enough to Osaka to make me a fan - even if a lot of it is the same type of food that can be found at a lot of teppanyaki places, they go above and beyond to offer interesting alternatives if you want more than grilled shrimp."}
{"text":"My to-go order of two basic rolls and a side salad took 40 minutes. We went to pick it up after 25 minutes (granted we were told it would take 15-20 minutes and it wasn't ready) then it took them over another 20 minutes to finish making it. I'm very unhappy, and their sushi is very sub par. Never going back!"}
{"text":"my family and I go to this restaurant quite often. We love it! The food is really good. The presentation is excellent.  The servers are very nice but have a hard time with English sometimes."}
{"text":"Well, a restaurant had to \"earn\" my first review and this one sure did. Fianc√© and I went out for our anniversary and picked Osaka so I made a reservation.   When we got there we were told the grill side was \"too crowded\" so we had to wait up front for ~10 minutes. Isn't that the point of a reservation? They finally took us back and there were already 2 people sitting at our table with drinks and apps in front of them. Not to mention these people waked in right after we did. Kind of puzzling.   Anyway, I tried to shake it off so we ordered drinks. My lady had a pi√±a colada, I had a mojito. Hers was meh. The mojito tasted like they forgot the alcohol. I didn't get anything else after because she didn't ask.   We ordered dinner and were excited because it looked like other tables were having fun. Our waitress brought the soup (pretty good but nothing to write home about) and that was the last we saw of her. Drinks sat empty, there were empty plates and bowls, and she was M.I.A. Finally, someone else came to clear the debris (still no inquiry about drinks though).   At this point, we have been here for around 50 minutes. I should note that I have never, ever done this, but after about 15 more minutes, we walked out. I stopped up front and told them I was going to do the right thing and pay for the drinks before we left. They were slightly apologetic and charged me for both drinks (surprised they didn't charge for the soup too). She told me that the chef was about to come out to our table if we wanted to eat still. At that point, I had steam coming out of my ears and nothing would have kept me there. Over an hour and our chef wasn't even there to start dinner?!  Long story short: - if you don't care about time, this place might be o.k. - poor service (likely very understaffed)  - drinks weren't great - food looked o.k. but I didn't actually eat any"}
{"text":"You can't beat the happy hour.  Great sushi selection all at a great price.  The crazy and dragon roll are delicious.  If sushi isn't your thing, order the teppenyaki.  I've never been disappointed here"}
{"text":"came here again last night, for the request of some friends. definitely way better experience!!! Jenna, and Peter  were our wonderful servers. Peter was the chef. he was super fun, Made way better food compared to our first visit, and he was a blast to have entertaining us!!!!"}
{"text":"Just back from a great evening at Osaka, celebrating my 75 BDAY. 4 of us upon leaving commented, \" what a great fun evening \" Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"I recently had my first experience at this teppanyaki restaurant and it was wonderful!  We came for a relative's birthday.  The atmosphere was lively, upbeat, and engaging.  There were many birthdays celebrated while we were there but each time the birthday song was sung, it was enjoyable.  They put a mask on the birthday guy/gal, hit the gong, and sing their own birthday song.  The entire dining room gets in on the fun.    There was quite a variety of foods to choose from on the menu and all were fairly priced.  My boyfriend and I decided to get a different teppanyaki plate each and to share.  It was so much food, but very delicious!    Our chef/entertainer had each one of us at the table laughing all night.  I've been to a few different teppanyaki restaurants, but this experience was by far the most enjoyable as far as entertainment goes.  So glad we chose this place for the birthday guy!  Two thumbs up, Osaka!"}
{"text":"We have gone there many times. The hibachi is always good, fresh. Drinks are good as well. We always know that we will get good food in a nice atmosphere that is well worth the drive. Great for a family to go out and get a unique dining experience at the hibachi table."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday on a Friday night and it was super fun! Our chef was a little shy, but with a little encouragement was able to make our time enjoyable. The only two complaints would be that we had a reservation at 7pm with 4 person party and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. Once seated and while we were ordering we were told that the $22 teppenaki menu selection was good for only two people. We decided to then buy two of the $22 servings for my family and we honestly received very little food. We received less than a cup of fried rice each and a very small amount of steak and chicken pieces with vegetables that were still stiff from only being cooked for a few minutes on the grill top. The food was still very good and tasty, just very small portions for a over $100 bill."}
{"text":"Osaka is one of our go-to favorites! Love the food and environment! The staff is always friendly and accommodating. It can be hard to get a table, especially on a weekend so I recommend calling ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Osaka ever since it opened.  The last two visits have been disappointing.  The first was at the tepanyaki ( cook it in front of you).  It seems like they have changed their recipes.  The soup has chunks of seaweed or something like it instead of mushrooms.  Which is fine but it just doesn't taste very good.  The ginger sauce seems different also.  This last visit they were very busy so we sat at a table.  Again the same tasteless soup.  My wife did like the salad dressing.  Had a good nutty sessamee seed flavor which was nice.  When our food came out the steak was cooked how we ordered it but was almost cold and tasted like they had forgotten any sort of seasoning .  Again the ginger sauce my daughter and I love putting on the rice was just not the same as In the past.  As an over all observation everything tasted like they forgot to season it meat, rice.  Could be just the difference between the table and the tepanyaki.  It will be a while before we give it another chance.  These past two visits were 2 stars but I gave it 3 because prior to that it was 4 and 5 stars"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but man it went downhill fast. My husband and I went on a date there on a Friday night. There was only a few other people there so it was super slow. The cook in the kitchen kept belching really loud the whole entire time we were there. We could hear the staff keep laughing at him. We were so disgusted and it totally ruined our appetites. The staff was very rude and sushi was definitely nothing special. We won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite part is they have both the oyster and uni shooters. Two types of oyster on 1/2 shell. Their boat is amazing with thick cuts and nice presentation. Very good variety of different sushi rolls.  Teppanyaki chefs are very entertaining. And I be alive I saw lobster and scallop on the menu as well. Bartender even worked their magic and made me a peach bourbon cocktail not on the menu. If you plan to go on the weekend make a reservation. Honestly those thick cuts of sashimi will keep me coming back. Please do not cut them thinner as another reviewer requested. They are perfect!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while now and it truly is the best place to go for sushi and Asian cuisine in Peoria and Glendale. The staff is always friendly and the service is prompt. The Chilango and Shogun sushi rolls are my favorites."}
{"text":"We ate there as a group of eight large athletic men.  We left completely satisfied.  I had the filet mignon and salmon combo.  It was mouth watering.  Prices were a little high, but worth the quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here a few times now and have had a great experience everytime. Food and service always fabulous. Most recently we tried the Teppanyaki with some friends and had a great time and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Took the entire family here for diner for our kids birthday. We tried to use the online reservations options, but never heard back so we called in also. We were sat at the teppanyaki table. We had Sam as the chef, he was great. Funny and Entertaining.  Our server was fine, came by with refills as needed and clearing plates. We all loved the food and show and on Sundays you get 1 free kids meal with a paid adult.  Might give this place another try. Little high price for a weekly trip."}
{"text":"Well, the food is good but the service is confusing. You get a waitress that can barely think straight and is so terribly afraid to look you in the eye. She even made dropping off the waters rehearsed. Very uncomfortable. There was a guy who did speak English that would come and make sure your order was actually correct. But the food is good. We didn't sit in the teppanyaki area because the majority of the party was eating sushi. I probably won't be back but worth a shot I guess."}
{"text":"Always had a great time here .We bring big party when we do come ,and its usally,Birthday party ,The food is good along with everything else ."}
{"text":"This is my very favorite Teppanyaki place in AZ. It has the very best food, entertaining chefs, and good prices.  I can't say enough good thing about the food. Its delicious! The steak is incredible and so tender. The shrimp & scallops are always cooked perfectly. The Yummy sauce is a must. You will be pouring it over everything.  My favorite part is the birthday song the staff plays. Its not your typical Happy Birthday song. Its so much more and it WILL get stuck in your head for days. I dare you not to sing a long."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food and atmosphere. They need to hire more people as service was super slow. You cant beat their happy hour prices though. Nothing can beat them out with those prices."}
{"text":"Great place to bring the family or friends. Teppan is very good but sometimes too salty, so just ask if that concerns you. What I like most is the consistently good sushi. Always very fresh. One of the only places around to have super white tuna. Several great rolls that focus on the fish, especially the tuna lover's roll. Have had some great service with the occasional problems with wait staff  communication difficulties. Several good kinds of sake. A birthday favorite. Also does suprisingly good take-out."}
{"text":"First time here.  Made a reservation for 9pm and wasn't seated until 9:45.  Other people at our table were also there waiting for over a hour so when we were finally seated everyone was grumpy/hangry which made it uncomfortable.  Our server was hard to understand and never explained how to or so there was much confusion for all of us that were new.  Other than that the food I ordered was delicious and the performer/cook was excellent and helped lighten up the mood."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night for a quick dinner after I got off work. We got there around 8 (they're open until 9:30 on Sundays). There were surprisingly still quite a few people there eating. We were immediately seated in the area for teppanyaki. They have separate seating for the sushi bar. It is a little expensive but the price is worth it for the amount of food and the entertainment of the show. The food was great for the most part. We both opted for the chicken and steak combo. The only complaint I have against it was the steak was a bit grisly. I recommend trying the chicken with spicy teriyaki (they use the regular teriyaki and sriracha). The service was fantastic and we got to have a nice chat with the other couple who was seated at the same table. I would recommend this place unless you hate people or dont like conversation with strangers."}
{"text":"Osaka's continues to be my favorite sushi spot.  The menu is extensive, the portions are generous, the teppan chefs are great fun, the sushi chefs know EXACTLY what they are doing and the sake is top notch.  Everything you want in one place at a good price.    We have never had a bad meal here and the service is always great.  After all these years they still use great quality ingredients and never skimp on portion size.  Other sushi places are just disappointing by comparison."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed.  We like to bring family and friends and we all enjoy the free entertainment at the teppanyaki tables.  The food is always tasty and, of course, extremely well presented.  My son has ordered various types of sushi, which he reports is excellent!  My only complaint:  some chefs utilize heavily-laced garlic butter while some chefs use plain butter (my preference).    Water, tea (hot or cold) are kept filled at all times.    When I have placed to-go orders, it seems to be a bit of a challenge for the hostess, as when I arrive for pick-up, the orders are never correct.    I would give five stars, but since there are continuing issues with our to-go orders, and a lack of consistency with butter v. garlic butter, I can only give three stars."}
{"text":"So far we love it! Didn't even make it to the teppanyaki table, but we will be back to try it soon. Started out in the bar with Sake bombs and a roll/sashimi but it was so good that we decided just to stay & order a couple more rolls. We had the Lisa Lisa Roll, The Texas Roll and the American Dream - sooo good! And the specialty rolls are huge! We couldn't finish, and that doesn't happen often for us. Happy hour looks amazing too"}
{"text":"I have been to many Hibachi places before. This place doesn't give enough portions for what is being paid. The fried rice had minimal flavor and was undercooked. I ordered the filet mignon and it was chewy with a lot of fat. I don't recommend going to this place. If you want hibachi, try going further into Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time at Osaka tonight, celebrating Valentine's Day. We arrived 1/2 hour early so we could get drinks and the hostess said they were running ahead but we could head for the bar and she would come get us.   We waited 10 minutes at our table in the bar but our server passed us up 5-6 times while avoiding eye contact. Even the bar, which was 'cleared' by patrons leaving for their tables, never got cleared of dirty dishes. Seems they need to add service in the bar area (the only reason I gave this review only 4 stars).  We were seated at our Teppanyaki table with two other groups: a couple and a party of six. The party of six knew a worker at Osaka so he came out and brought them bottles of bubbly sake. He then saw us looking longingly at the bottles and brought us some as well-nice touch. It was very good.   Our chef, Leo, was excellent. We asked for Gluten Free soy sauce and he cooked our meal on one side of the grill, while he cooked everyone else's in the middle and other side. That was cool since he had ten meals to serve.   My wife got the Teppanyaki Filet Mignon and Scallops and I ordered the Filet with shrimp. We got a cold house salad and hot broth soup, fried rice, grilled veggies and the entrees. We were stuffed!  The filets were cooked perfectly and the scallops and shrimp were excellent as well.   I recommend Osaka for any occasion but make reservations like we did, that place is busy!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years for teppanyaki and sushi roles and have always had great food, entertainment, and overall experience.  The teppanyaki tables are fun for the whole family and you are certain to hear the drums for birthday celebrations."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for my moms birthday the other day. We weren't allowed to be taken back to the hibachi area until our entire group had arrived. Ok reasonable. Even after our entire party had arrived we still waited about 10 minutes to actually be seated. After that we waited another 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken. Another 10+ for our orders to be taken. Then we watched as other tables who arrived after us were served & the chef went right over to prepare their meals. Weird right? It's like we didn't even make a reservation. At this point the hungry children that were with us were beginning to complain. Long story short, we arrived at 6:45 & dinner was finally off the grill by 9 something. Pretty awful customer service especially for a reserved table.  The food is DELICIOUS the though. Whenever I want teppanyaki I'll be sure to call in."}
{"text":"This food is delicious, i use to go to Ichiban (99th ave and mcdowell) loved it their.  Never went anywhere else when i wanted to eat japanese/chinese now that they closed it made me search for a new spot came accross this place and im glad i did its better than ichiban the only thing is i went closer to closing maybe everyone was tired but i wish the waiter was more tentative."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT HERE! Forsure one of my new favorite places. The atmosphere is great, very family friendly, and all of the staff is friendly, very helpful, and all around exceptional. This is the place to go. 10/10 in my book."}
{"text":"Well, I took my girlfriend here for a simple lunch since she never had teppanyaki before.  I wanted her to experience the food and the \"show\".  I was pleasantly surprised by the nice job the chef did - he put on a decent show, especially for lunch, and provided my girlfriend with some entertainment.  The prices are reasonable and the food is acceptable.  We decided we will come back again and bring her kids so they could experience teppanyaki too.  We were both satisfied with this place and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for sushi. The staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the prices are matched to the quality of food. They have a really good sushi chef that makes great rolls."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot to offer especially for large parties.  Their teppanyaki is a bit more entertaining than others.  If it's your birthday, you will get to wear these scary and at same time funny Chinese full head masks as they hit the drums and start singing their signature birthday song loudly.  They also have squirt bottles of alcohol and will offer the whole table shots of it.  It really is entertaining and fun for all.  Be aware that you will hear the birthday song and drums all night long.  Either everyone goes there for their bday or everyone fakes their bday just to get serenaded but the whole restaurant sings a long.    They frequently have a wait but their bar area has a lot of high tops to hang out at and you can order sushi and drinks there as well.  Their sushi is not top-notch but still good.  I like the more basic traditional rolls (yellowtail roll, citrus roll, alaskan) and am happy when I stick to those. My husband loves their giant combo special rolls and they are overkill here.  The roll is giant almost like a skinny burrito and will have 6+ ingredients and over-stuffed with imitation crab mix.  I don't want mouthfuls of fake crab.  However, like I said, some people love the ingredient overkill.    Their happy hour is great too.  Lots of tiered options from $3-8 appetizer, rolls, and drinks. They even have happy hour on weekends!  Great go-to for any occasion or no occasion!"}
{"text":"went here with 2 friends a few weeks ago & we really enjoyed our food. I always get dragon rolls cuz i love soft shell crab! i also ordered another roll that was super tasty with a mango slice on top of it but i cant think of the name. it was a slow night so not a lot of people were there. the service was on point & she was nice. would come back here when im in this area again!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is Tuesday night $1 Sake and $4 sushi plates. We come here every time we're in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Really overpriced. Got takeout and I have never seen nigiri so small and so thin. For the amount I spent here I could get better quality and twice the sushi someplace else."}
{"text":"Had a great family dinner over thanksgiving holiday. Service was great and the teppan chef was really fun and entertaining. The food was reliable I would have never tried this place without yelp and it's great reviews. Thanks everyone for taking the time to review."}
{"text":"Stellar lunch specials with decent sushi and great service. My coworkers and I love coming here for lunch and will continue to make this our go-to sushi place on workdays. We have also done the teppanaki and it was so much fun! The chef was hilarious and really made the whole table of strangers feel like friends. I want to try their $1 sake Tuesdays sometime."}
{"text":"Saki flowing. Place rocks. Most places fried rice is bland but there's was good. PS. I'm drunk off saki bombers."}
{"text":"So I figured I'd give this place one more try.   You see because the first time we ate here they tried to kill me.  An assassin placed the tip of a mechanical pencil in my sushi.    I bit into a sushi roll and I pulled out a hard plastic tube from a mechanical pencil. You would not believe the look my wife gave me when I pulled that damn thing out of my mouth.   it look like it had been cut in half so I can only assume that when they're making the rice in the back they Musta had some free time and decided to answer the age-old question: \"which is mightier: the pen or the sword?\"  Or maybe they were just playing around with their ninja swords and I don't fucking know. But anyway.   So now it's a few months later and I went back to see if the assassins of the kitchen would make an attempt on my life again.   And we had a couple rolls and what I really found was that the sushi there is just kind a limited, it's kind of blah.   I think with this place is actually known for is there teppanyaki, which I haven't had because it's not really my thing so I can't really speak to it. Could be amazing I guess you'll just have to find out and let us know.   I should say that when they tried to kill me with the pen in the sushi trick they were nice enough to remove the roll from the bill.  I wife actually wanted to walk out at that point, I was disgusted and mortified at myself when I finish the meal.   Shameless for the purposes of science.   And now looking back on it I think I'm a little disgusted in myself and that's where I think I'll end this.   Pip pip!"}
{"text":"Really fun, food was very good. Comparable to Benihana."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in to Osaka at 9:15 pm and we were told very awkwardly/rude by a girl with glasses that they were closed! A whole hour early? Hmm not cool and very unprofessional"}
{"text":"We took our whole family here for my son's 18th birthday. It was entertaining and the food was fresh and flavorful! Everything we ate was REALLY good! We ALL had a great time! A little on the expensive side for having to pay for so many of us, but so worth it on such a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. First I made reservations for a table for four(not the hibachi table where the chef prepares/cooks your food in front of you). We get there and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated, but finds out that we were being seated at the habachi table. Afterwards, they apologize and gets our table. Then we waited another 10 minutes when they took our order. It took another 20 minutes to get our meals. The place was not even crowded. The place had a nice, quiet ambience,,,,but the service was awful. We kept having to wave down for someone to even get refill on our water.   I enjoyed the food, but by then I was tired."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for happy hour. Great food and low prices and the servers are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my families favorite Japanese restaurant.  The staff is always warm and friendly.  The food is fresh and delicious.  They have a great dessert menu.   Don't miss an opportunity to stop and enjoy."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could 5 thumbs down   Guy making sushi uses glasses and kept pushing them up with his gloves, same gloves he was making the rolls with, has a bad old smell inside the place, rolls are super tiny and have no good flavor like other places I've been too, what a disappointment and waste of 30.00, I will never come back here and won't recommend it to anyone I know, Tomo in Goodyear is 10xs Better then this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked this out for the teppanyaki.  Place filled up fast at 5:00, chef was fun and entertaining and the food was excellent.  Chicken and Shrimp, rice was delish.  Needed just a bite or two of ice cream after but I was stuffed. Wish more restaurants used eco friendly takeout boxes."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment six or seven times now and each time I'm less impressed with the service. The only reason I have continued to come here is because it's close to where I live and the food I like is cheap. When we come in it usually takes several minutes for anyone to help us. Which wouldn't normally bother me but several employees looked at us and continued to watch TV or walked to the back. I will not be eating here anymore because we went in on a Saturday night at 9:50 because they close at 10:30 every Saturday night. The young girl that helped us had long black hair and could not have had worse customer service skills. I walked in and she went to the chef first and they both looked over at me and then she approached me to let me know they were closing in ten minutes and asked me if that was ok with me..... I told her the website says they close at 10:30 and she seemed flustered because she was lying right. To my face so they wouldn't have to serve anymore customers. She told me it was slow so they were closing, meanwhile they had two tables full of twenty people or so still receiving food. I'm sad they employees they have there are so lazy because I would love to continue going here otherwise."}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise!! Everything from the happy hour appetizers and drinks and dinner exceeded our expectations.  Full restaurant tonight and good service from David our waiter.  We leave with to go boxes and very full, satisfied tummies.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We started off ordering our meal and requested no masago we received our appetizer that was overcooked like crunchy chewing gum.  It was suppose to be calamari. We were watching our waitress when she picked up Our order pointing at the rolls the chef said its fine and shewed her away. When she brought it to our table she told us that there was masago in two of the rolls and she said the chef said \" there's only a little bit\" needless to say we will not be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with some friends, who are regulars here, and had a blast! It was my friend's wife's birthday. This is a popular birthday spot, since they did the birthday song about 8 times in the 2 hours we ate. The show was good, and so was the food! They make everyone have fun by taking a squirt bottle of Sake, and shooting it in your mouth. One guy at our table went to the count of 60, good thing he wasn't driving.  If you go as a couple then do the dinner for two. It's the best deal on the menu for the grill. You get 4 meats for $26 a person. We had the Filet, Scallops, Salmon, and Swordfish. My wife who usually is not a Scallops fan loved them the most.    We'll be back for Sushi, and Rolls. They build some GREAT rolls."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday the other day and I absolutely loved it. The chef made the experience so fun..I wish I remembered his name. Everyone seemed to enjoy their time, even at other tables. They put a hilarious mask on you and sing happy birthday, which I thought was awesome. All of my friends and family are planning on going back for their birthday because they loved it so much. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Brought in party of 7 with a reservation. We had two elders in our group and they did a good job being sure that we got to sit right on time. Great show at the cooking table!! We got a little tired of the gong that was perched right next to our table being repeatedly banged for birthday celebrations. I feel like banging it through out every song was overkill. Would definitely recommend the place maybe during a non peak hour it's less birthday focus. We had 10 in the two hours we were there."}
{"text":"been sitting here for 20mins now and no one has greater us. everyone keeps passing by. No water or ANYTHING. very rude and disrespectful! so disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was average but the food was very tasty! Must try the play boy roll!"}
{"text":"Most fun at a restaurant on the east side of town hands down.   Service was great and the energy was off the charts.   The owners did a great job on the decor inside, which provides a great ambiance that matches the positive vibe.  Felt like we were on vacation.  Food was good, flirting with great on teppenyaki standards.   Sushi selections could be modified to offer a more regionalized fare, but really no complaints.    Plan to frequent this spot for sure."}
{"text":"Staff is great, Jonathan is nice and professional. Highly recommend the Osaka quesadilla and mozzarella tempura. Atmosphere is intimate and quiet. Great for a date."}
{"text":"Used to absolutely love this place until my last experience. The food is always absolutely amazing and prices are fair. However, the wait for Teppan table was an HOUR AND A HALF WAIT for 5 people on a WEDNESDAY night. The hostess had a complete attitude when telling her we did not have a reservation. There were two Teppan tables that weren't in use. Better staffing is needed here for sure! I reluctantly won't be back for a while, which is a shame because I love their food."}
{"text":"Really previous reviewers? This place is so loud, screaming little children/kids  running around, very crowded seats at grills, rude/indifferent bartender. So disappointed, and we haven't even eaten yet! There are several grills that still have piles of dirty dishes, and this is prime time Saturday night!  Unless the food is beyond amazing, will not be back! Beniyana was better, and I hate going to chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"Always a fun spot to visit with several friends. Just be prepared because you will hear the \"Happy Birthday\" song about 20 times. No joke. Food is always good and the chefs are always funny and put on a good show."}
{"text":"The thing about this place is the food....ie sashimi ,tempura,pot stickers rolls are all good .they serve cocktails but the bar tender/ tenders are slow and do not make a good  drink. Service is always polite but again sometimes slow and inconsistent. tonite they forgot the roll we ordered and we think they gave it to the table next to us allthough it was not on the bill."}
{"text":"Excellent! Dinner box with teriyaki chicken was amazing. Also had gyoza and garlic tuna yaki. Both were very good. Only had to wait about 25 mins on a busy prom Sat night for the dining room."}
{"text":"The new bartender working 8/31/17 at 7pm was horrible. I came in and asked if he could turn on the Cardinals football game. He said, \"you know no one cares about preseason?\"  I said, \"I do\". He continued to bust my chops saying Cardinals will loose and no one cares about watching. I smiled and let him ramble on.   So then I sat, waiting...waiting some more, then kept waiting. His buddies were sitting at the bar and he was BS'ing with them. I made eye contact with him 3 times, so I know he didn't forget about me. Not once did he bring me water or a menu. After waiting 10 min I walked out.   Never have had a bad experience in Osaka before today. This guy is gonna kill your business."}
{"text":"My family and I came here on a Thursday night for my mom's birthday and we had the teppanyaki. We had reservations, which I highly recommend- especially if you come on a Friday or weekend, i imagine it gets very crowded. Anyway, it was so much fun! I can't remember the last time my whole family was laughing so hard together. The jokes were hilarious, the tricks were entertaining, and the food was outstanding! And the portion sizes were huge! We each ordered a \"combination plate\" and shared it between 2 people. While we were finishing up dinner we said we should come here for everyone's birthday because it was that much fun. I definitely recommend coming here for the teppanyaki for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"The staff was welcoming & very friendly. service was great, always refilling our drinks and making sure we were doing well. Food was also very flavorful!! loved my experience here"}
{"text":"The restaurant look so nice and the price was very reasonable but there couple complain the waiter we doesn't speak to much English and don't even understand was we saying and always rushing and also we have the chef don't even saying a word and his cooking was terrible fried rice look like steam rice and also nothing with black pepper added no taste that all"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, the glass where we had our sake bombers were really cold which made the beer really nice and cold and the sushi was amazing,  we got the  Maz roll and the Mango tango roll. Plus they have all these different one that I can't wait to try on My return.   Im so happy to have found this place because its really hard to find a delicious sushi place in My side of town."}
{"text":"Food is good 8 out of 10 times. Service sucks 10 out of 10 times. Have been to this location numerous times. Tired of the treatment. Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"This place was great! I came in from out of town to meet up with a friend for food and drinks. The food was outstanding, the service was great, and the atmosphere was exciting! I couldn't ask for a better experience. I felt as if the staff were my friends, that's how welcoming they are. All the food was cooked perfectly, I ordered my steak blue so there wasn't much cooking involved but it was perfect! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came to your restaurant on Tuesday pm (in Peoria) at approx 8:30ish for a dinner with our 11 yr old daughter and my wife. She was celebrating an 11 yr old birthday and we had a super time up until the end as we were very close to the kitchen. After hearing conversations, in the kitchen, close to closing time, we heard a few F-bombs that startled my daughter and she looked at me with shock and disgust. I wanted to let you know this so it doesn't happen to other patrons moving forward. I also wanted you professionals involved so they (You) have a serious, adult like Manager on duty so these kids or nonprofessionals don't act unruly.         Mike M"}
{"text":"Went here with a big group of girls for a bachelorette party. We had reservations, but were about 10 min late and found that our table had been given to another bach party. Go figure! No worries, we were patient and seated in 15 minutes on a busy Sat night. We were at the teppanyaki table and our chef was hilarious. I wish I could remember his name, because he had us all fired up, doing Sake shooters from across the grill! I ordered 2 sushi rolls--both delish. Food was definitely yummy, but again, our chef is what made our night and had everyone pumped. Nearby tables had birthday parties and they made the honored person wear a creepy dragon mask or boy/girl head and sang an Asian inspired Happy Birthday! The whole place was lively and the food was great. Loved it."}
{"text":"I love this place the fried rice is amazing happy hour specials are awesome, we were there 2015 for New Year's Eve and it snowed. I will probably be there tomorrow Sundays kids eat free"}
{"text":"I've yet to have had a bad experience here. This place is great for birthdays, lunch with a friend, or easy fast take out. Their food is always spectacular and service is even better. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Food here is good however this is the third time here. Always make a reservation, yet they can never seat you at the correct time. Made reservation for 6pm this time arrived about 15 till and was told it would probably be 25 minutes. OK no problem. Check on seating situation and find out it going to be another 30 to 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Always awesome food and great service! The place is always packed but we never have to wait more than a few minutes to get seated! It can be a little pricey, but considering how much food you get, plus the entertainment, plus it is quite literally fresh off the grill, it's all worth it! We have never had a bad time here and we've come probably 5-10 times now"}
{"text":"I have been there twice !! Food is beyond amazing and the atmosphere is so much fun !! Especially for birthdays!!! Will recommend this place for sure !"}
{"text":"Have been here many, many times for sushi.  Always consistently good.  Their rock shrimp appetizer is a favorite.  Pleasant staff and very reasonable prices.  I have not had steak or full dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as we usually goto the other sushi place in the same area.  We wanted a nice dinner and cozy table.  We got in and was seated right away.  The place has 2 dining areas, 1 tappenyaki side and the other has dining tables and a bar.    The sushi was good, i would give it 4 stars.  We ordered 4 different rolls and some calamari.  We had mochi ice cream and it was good.   I would have given this place more stars but our server made a huge goof.  We ordered drinks first, he put them in then took our orders.  Then a little while later our food showed up.  He ask was there anything else he could get us?  I was like huh?  What about our drinks. ..  He forgot to bring our drinks.    We will likely visit again and i will update my review of the service is better."}
{"text":"15 minutes sitting down without any greeting. Staff your location properly for Friday night."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday night with or two kids. We patiently waited and ordered appetizers while waiting to get started at teppanyaki. After our appetizers had been served, they seated a group of 4 adults celebrating her birthday at our table from the bar. Not only were they loud and obnoxious but they took forever to order because they were too busy yapping than ordering or looking at the menu. They were focused more on the alcohol menu than the food menu. They kept trying to order a drink that was nonexistent at this location but apparently is served at the Mesa location. The server had to go back and forth with the bartender. Then another at least 20-30minutes after we had finished our appetizers, they were finally ready to order. It was late for my kids to eat already but even later because they decided to seat this inappropriate group with us. Several times, i contemplated leaving or asked to be moved. My kids get restless when sitting and doing nothing next to loud drunk people for an hour before any food is served. We literally were the last in the restaurant to leave. That's how long this group took. Not only that, they were all taking sake and vodka shots that the chef was squirting into their mouths throughout the dinner. We did not drink any of it. We were there to eat, not drink. The teppanyaki was good but the all around situation was terrible. My experience that night supercedes any quality food they may have had. I think matchups like this should be prevented. I would've rather sat at a table and had zero teppanyaki show."}
{"text":"Great staff, lots of menu options, and a unique teppan! What more could I ask for?   -Food was good, nothing super duper new as far as teppan fare goes but still good. We had the filet mignon and lobster. -The show was...memorable. The chef really interacted with our group. He brought a whole new meaning to \"Sake time\". Also, pee-pee boy. (you'd have to go to understand...) -Price was on par with other teppans.  This isn't a corporate teppan so expect fire!"}
{"text":"The kids always ask for the same Teppan restaurant for their birthday, but this year we wanted to try something new. When entering the restaurant the staff was friendly and accommodating (considering we made a very last minute reservation.) We each ordered sushi to see how their rolls compare and we were not let down! The rolls were huge and flavorful! The tuna was very fresh and blended well with the other flavors. For Teppan, we ordered chicken, steak and shrimp  Let me say this, BEST FRIED RICE EVER! Even though we were so full from the sushi we had to keep eating! I highly recommend this place and we will be frequenting it often!"}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant that offers fusion type sushi. The staff are very nice and I always look forward to coming here in Arizona. The reason I give it four stars is because I'm not a big fan of their happy hour sushi menu. However, some of the items on there are very yummy but overwhelming. I wish they had regular sushi on the happy hour menu too :( overall, very tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great sushi & they had a lot of specialties that you don't normally find at sushi bars. Great restaurant-looking forward to returning and enjoying some Tapan"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it's already become one of our favorite places. All the food is good but the scallops are to die for - who knew you could get amazing scallops in the middle of Arizona? The atmosphere is so fun. The teppanyaki chefs are very interactive, funny, and great with all ages. People must lie that's it's their birthday because the birthday song seems to play every 5 minutes. It's a super catchy tune with a live gong. As the say, more sake more happy!"}
{"text":"Osaka has great Happy Hour and tempanyaki!  Highly recommend. Always fun with the family. Don't forget the yummy yummy sauce!  Our Sever David is a cutie."}
{"text":"They sent out a salad with out the dressing.  They messed up the sushi order which they ended up fixing, however the wasabi was NOT fresh. It was browning and going stale. I would not recommend for sushi. HH prices are high."}
{"text":"I've been going here regularly for several years and never had a bad experience.  Quite simply, it's my favorite place in East Valley to dine.  Period."}
{"text":"Love the sushi and ambiance of this restaurant. Never seems too busy, so grabbing a table is usually pretty easy."}
{"text":"If you're in search of teppanyaki and good entertainment, look no further! I would recommend calling ahead to make a reservation as this place fills up on the weekends. Osaka is a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary (whoa, that birthday song) and drink a ton of saki while doing it- you'll see what I mean when you arrive! The service is amazing and the teppanyaki chefs really know their knife and food throwing skills. I normally order the chicken and shrimp combination which is about $25. It comes with soup, salad, egg fried rice, vegetables and of course the meat. It's a ton of food so come hungry! I personally love their yum yum white sauce which is served on the side of every entr√©e. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went here with two friends. We made a reservation and only had to wait about 5 minutes to sit down at a teppanyaki table on a Friday night. The food and drinks were a 4/5. I had tempura veggies, garlic edamame, and vegetable and tofu teppanyaki(extra points for having a vegetarian option at a steak house! ). I would also recommend the pear Cosmo. There were 6 teppanyaki tables in the room and in the hour and a half that we were there they sang happy birthday to at least 8 people... they also squirt shots of saki into people's mouths with a bottle... several times throughout dinner. And shots of juice or something for kids. It was strange and the ambience is the reason I gave it a 3 instead of 4."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Happy hour food menu tasted great and fresh. Got the chicken omurice, edamame, stuffed salmon mushrooms, yellowtail roll, and eel avacado roll. Also tried a little bit of hard cider, their Angry Orchard, which was really good."}
{"text":"Food was good however service was not.  Had a reservation at 6pm. Did not get a server to us until 625 to even get us water.  Server forgot soup and salad for all 5 of us.  Management did not adjust the final bill.   Instead told us they gave the kids meal for free.   That is already a Sunday special.  Was informed there were a lot of walk ins.   You should really take care of people that reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"Oh wow. Just tried Osaka in east Mesa and the food and service is awesome. The Rockstar roll is the best roll ever. The Mama Mia roll is also very very good.  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We just ate at this restaurante on 09/14 to celebrate my 13 year old son's birthday. I was completely disappointed because I told the girl in the front desk to tell our waiter it was his birthday. We wanted to have them sing happy birthday and make it special. Well guess what? They forgot about it. So we spend $140 on a dinner to celebrate but did not get the special attention.  This is not an authentic japanese Teppanyanki. They put sauce in everything and it loose the point of trying the sauce they put in front of you. The only thing it was good here was the fried rice and even that it was salty.  We will not return to this restaurant and I do not recommend to anyone who want to experience a good Japanese Teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Celebrated a special family occasion with dear friends.  We enjoyed our ginger salads and house onion soup,  before our main courses of swordfish,  beef fillet & Shrimp and chicken only entrees via excellent Tepanaki (prepared by Chef Chung, who did a FANTASTIC job!)  prepared cooking style!  We enjoyed our soup and salads and Kirin beer. Chef Chung also provided ample Sake shots via his squirt bottle! Gratitude to you Chef Chung for your excellent cooking technique and humor! We'll done sir! Special thanks to our server Clayton, for taking extra care of us, you're a consummate professional,  yet friendly server! Well  done brother!  An excellent,  well prepared meal by Chef Chung and server. Clayton! You both made this special occasion for our party of four, memorable! See you all again!  Hook 'em!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite place to go for Japanese food.  The only thing missing is noodles!  After having lived in Japan, and China for years, I sincerely believe this pace has some of the best sushi in the AZ area.    For me personally, I wish they would put about half the sauce that they usually do on their rolls.  Even still, there is a great variety and all super yummy and fresh!"}
{"text":"What an absolute trainwreck! We had 6:30 pm reservations for a party of 4, and arrived about 15 minutes early. There were lots of people outside, but we had reservations, right? We were told that they were running behind by 90 minutes. We made these reservations 2 weeks ago for Mother's Day dinner and couldn't believe they could get it that wrong. We were told by the front staff that we could leave and they would call us when our table was ready. We called back at 8 pm after hearing nothing, only to be told that they didn't know they were supposed to call us back, but that if we came right now there was a table ready for us.   We decided to go back just because we were starving at this point. When we arrived, they had a table with 3 seats available, but there were 4 in our party. I was pretty agitated and asked at the front to see the manager. I was told they weren't available. There were 3 teenage girls at the front who were clearly struggling with pissed off customers, with nobody to back them up. Nobody ever came out to apologize or offer a free appetizer or anything. I'd say the manager was busy that night, but apparently it was at home away from where he was needed.   We were eventually seated around 8:30 and then it took another 40 minutes for our chef to come to the table. Randy was wonderful (which is how I can justify 1 star to this restaurant) and said he had been working for the last 11 hours. More horrible management, methinks. The food was ok, but I've had much better at similar restaurants. I will say that the server wad on top of things and brought our drink orders quickly. I just feel bad for the entire staff that was left in the dark to fend for themselves. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My family (a party of 10) went here last night with no reservation to celebrate 2 birthdays. The service was exceptional. They were able to seat us right away and our waitress was really accommodating. We obviously came for the hibachi table show. It did not disappoint. The chef was very skilled and funny throughout his performance. The food was delicious. We all had something different from the filet mignon, to the lobster, to the swordfish, and salmon and everyone was happy with their order. For 2 of the kids meals, we asked to substitute noodles for the rice which they did with no problem. The waitress even brought out a bowl of ice when she served the soup in case we needed to cool down the soups for the little kids--I thought this was so considerate to do without even being asked. When it came time for cake and the birthday song, the staff plays the song over the speakers and has these hilarious full head masks for the birthday boy/girl to wear. It was so funny and made for great photos. All in all, a great night out and this will be my go to for hibachi going forward. Between the delicious food and the wonderful staff, everyone in our party left happy."}
{"text":"We normally go to Sumo, but they were randomly closed tonight so we decided to try Osaka, and I'm glad we did.  The fish we fresh, the service was on point and the sushi chef was very nice.  We had a nice conversation with him.  Plus, I love zucchini tempura, but hate when it's little circles because they get so soggy, and they were willing to cut it into spears and give me a whole tempura plate for just zucchini!  That kind of modification exemplifies great customer service in my book.  We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with great food.  I will definitely go back for some sushi...just had the teppan this time. Scallops and the beef were great."}
{"text":"The food was very good, for what it is the prices were very good as well.  I had the steak, filet mignon cooked medium rare. I also had some of the  sushi which was also very good. I would definitely recommend this place and go back."}
{"text":"I reserved a Teppanyaki table here for 9 so we could celebrate my husband's birthday. I was annoyed by the fact that I made the reservation the day before but when we got there they made us wait 30 minutes past our reservation time. Reminded us of the Seinfeld episode, \"You know how to take the reservations, you just don't know how to keep them\", lol. We can laugh about it now. We checked back in several times with a dismissive, \"Your table will be ready soon, you are next\" from the host, every time. It took my husband, who's birthday it was, walking up to the host desk and asking for manager before they finally told us our table was ready. I still gave it 4 stars because once we were seated, they almost totally redeemed themselves. The only other drawback was, I think everyone there was celebrating a birthday. We heard the birthday song and drums playing what seemed like every 10 minutes. The food was really good and the chef at our table was amazing and funny. We ended up having a wonderful time. We made sure to give the chef a great tip, he deserved it!"}
{"text":"I have only sat in the sushi side of the restaurant and not the tepanyaki so that is what I am basing my review on. Their sushi is excellent!! We were very skeptical to go in because no one was there; and trying a new sushi place with no one there is a little scary. This was a great find! Their sushi is amazing and very fresh. The Osaka roll is to die for! Although you might look at the price and think it's too much, there is plenty to split. It comes with a lobster tail that is served in a martini glass placed on the plate above the sushi. It's amazing! All the other rolls we had there were delicious as well. Have already been back twice and plan to keep coming back! The service is great, the place is really clean and decorated very nicely, and there are TVs around for you to watch the game (that's what my fianc√© looks for lol).  I would recommend anyone looking for a sushi place in this area to try Osaka!"}
{"text":"Tasteless, weak green tea. Medium rare to rare steak cooked almost well done. Asked for broccoli,  cabbage, bean sprouts, zucchini,  mushroooms. Tge cook has no idea what cabbage or bean sprouts are. They don't use them anyway. He forgot my mushrooms,  so I got zucchini and broccoli after I had eaten all my steak.  They atrract people by the rapping of the blades, missing food tossing into the customer's mouths and shooting Saki into willing customer's mouths. I didn't want rice, which is a major part of what they serve with lunch. They serve a completely tasteless broth with raw, uncooked white musrooms and a few slivers of slivers of green onions in the soup.the lunch salad consists of white colored head lettuce,  red cabbage and one tiny tasteless tomatoe topped with Thousand Island dressing- Yucky, too. A totally rememorable experience for all the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"Fun place for a teppanyaki dinner. Our chef, Joe, kept us all laughing while he cooked our meal. He chatted, shot saki in our mouths, produced a lot of fire (scared one small child) and flirted with the good looking girl in the group, told us about himself and made sure each diner got the food they ordered.   Food was good, everyone enjoyer themselves and it was a diverse crowd at our table. Three of us adults and a family with two kids. Solid place to have a good time."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! There are many options to choose from and always leftovers to take home because of the portion size being so large. My classmates and I go here a lot, whether it's for birthdays or just for lunch-we know we are always taken care of here!"}
{"text":"We've been here for Happy Hour Sushi before and loved it! They have great rolls w/ some nice flavors! We've been wanting to try the Teppanyaki so decided we'd give it a whirl! lol So glad we did it so much fun! The family we were seated with was so nice and even shared their Geisha roll with us :) I did the Mahi Mahi, Kevin had the Filet mignon & Chicken and my son had the kids steak. The chef Dan was a hoot and really great with everyone and his performance while cooking. My son loved the apple juice in the baby bottle for the kids! I didn't try the saki but the group had a lot of fun with it lol It was a little expensive but for all the food you get and the fun time with strangers and dinner it was something we will definitely do again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was ok. The refused to honor two check in offers from yelp even though we had 6 people. We could have split checks but I'm not that person. Chef was fun"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was good as well. We had the steak/chicken and calamari/shrimp. We will definitely be back! A show while you eat was also fun and a different night out."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Ask for Van, she's sweet and nice.  Great place to grab a bite before going to see a movie  at Harkins across the street.  It'll be my spot to eat before all my movies over here."}
{"text":"The chef way overcooked all the food. And used a ton of soy sauce.  Without exaggeration he used about a cup worth on the rice.  The plate had a pool of it under the food. And the amount of garlic used on the food would keep a vampire away for sure.  The food was inedible. Oh and forget the little \"show\" they usually do,  there wasn't one.  He did the sake in the mouth and threw food at us to catch,  but that's it. When we spoke to the manager,  he was uncaring.  He said no one else complained. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I go here nearly once a month and we love it! Always do the teppanyaki and get the couples dinner, choose from 4 meats, awesome every time."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!  Awesome presentation, amazing service and exceptional food !!! Levi and David are the best !!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Happy hour all day every day, $2 draft domestic, $2 edamame and an entire vegetarian sushi roll section!! You would be surprised how many sushi joints aren't vegan/veg friendly. Super mad I didn't find out about this delicious restaurant sooner!"}
{"text":"Went here for my brothers birthday service was a little off but the food was good the sushi roll we got was really good and the entertainment was the best"}
{"text":"The happy hour is amazing!  2 apps, 3 rolls, a coke and a glass of wine for $31!  The food was great and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"We go to many restaurants, and most times the waitress or waiters are just not detailed oriented enough to check in on you and notice when your glass is empty, ask us if we need anything. Well we went to Osaka and Mariah our waitress was the best. Kind, considerate, watched for our glasses being emptied, asked us if we needed anything. Very rare you get someone this detailed in the serving industry. We mentioned this to the Manager on duty because so many times people complain about wait staff, but we felt we needed to display this young lady's exemplary ability to make our time there the best we had at Osaka in Gilbert. Thank you Mariah for being great at your job. This young woman should be training others and helping other wait staff be the best they can be. It was a Saturday and it was very busy too, but still we received Mariah great service."}
{"text":"Yelp should have a \"thumbs down\" or (-) Negative rating because this place was horrible. First, it wasn't open at the time it said they were open. We had to go around the whole building looking for another entrance. We saw their cook smoking outside -wearing his apron!!!!  When we did a final \"peep\" throughout the door, their supervisor finally came out and said that they'll be open in a few minutes.  We first ordered an appetizer- Calamari. It was very chewy, tasteless and worse, the batter was dark - the cooking oil they used must have been one that's been used and reused! And it was very oily - the calamari was put in the oil when it wasn't hot enough!  I felt cheated!!!! The sushi roll we ordered was a sorry attempt of a fusion - some steak and avocado and the beef dish was not what we thought it was.  We did have a very pleasant server and that was the only good thing about this Japanese restaurant. Definitely NOT recommending this place."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat. We came for lunch. Our chef was funny and entertaining. Everything was cooked really well except the vegetables. It was so salty that my husband and I couldn't eat it. There was way too much soy sauce. I had the steak and shrimp tepenyaki and my husband had the filet mignon.  For appetizers he had the gyoza and I had the tuna poke. The appetizers were really delicious. We will definitely be returning with hopes of the veggies being more edible."}
{"text":"This is a review of the dining area, not the teppanyaki.  We ordered family style.  The sushi was the Godzilla, rainbow, tuna, and spicy snow crab rolls.  Plus we ordered the crispy calamari, gyoza, and tempura shrimp salad  I felt better ordering the sushi this time because at their other location my wife ordered it (I had ordered curry) and she let me try it.  It was good.  So we ordered it here, and it was good again!  I guess last time they were having an off day, perhaps?  The sushi seemed reasonably fresh, and it was nice that they emphasized the 'stuffing' rather than the surrounding rice.  Some sushi places you get a fat roll of rice with a little bit of tuna (or whatever) hiding inside.  If you look at the diameter of their rolls, half of it was the filling.  In fact, the Godzilla had only a thin shell of rice.  So, in other words, they didn't try to cut corners and give us lots of rice.  I could taste what was inside.  I like that.  Come at happy hour and you'll save a bundle."}
{"text":"It's been a year since my last review.  We have come here a few times during that year.  Today was another birthday, and so we wanted to take advantage of the birthday teppanyaki coupon.   I had the filet teppanyaki. The recipe is pretty standard for the dishes, and as is the menu.  Fried rice, some veggies, the filet, and a few shrimp.   Oh...and miso and salad before.  The food was very good.  And our chef was entertaining.  Really that's the key to the whole teppanyaki experience.  This place is consistently loud and busy.  As I am submitting a new review I also want to mention that we ate in the main dining area (i.e. not teppanyaki).  It's small, so probably best to have a reservation.  The food there is really good too.  It's become our new favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar with a bunch of people we didn't know, but by the end people from different groups were chatting. The chef made the night very exciting and lively. I did notice that not all the chefs gave it as much effort or were as excited as ours; we must have gotten lucky. The food was delicious. The fried rice was yummy as well as our main course. We chose the dinner for two, so we got to pick four meats. We chose filet mignon, shrimp, sword fish, and calamari. Everything was great! Although I was a bit confused when out chef served us the calamari, I was expecting a tiny intact squid, it looked like a slab of fish, but it was delicious none the less. It did seem however that a majority of the crowd was getting extremely drunk, they were shouting across the room and talking very loudly. There was a couple of families there with young children, which might have been more appropriate at a table instead of the grill because the chefs play with fire and squirts saki in your mouth. The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for, I was barely able to finish all the food they have me!! Overall it was a fun night and yummy food. I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, if you haven't tried teppenaki you need to! But request Sam! He is the best ! Service can be better with some servers, we come here a lot so we enjoy the food just would appreciate better service. Sushi can be a bit pricey but it is good."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Very fresh and really beautiful display! Definitely won't be going anywhere else for sushi beside here anymore !!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time here for the teppanyaki dinner for two. Food was delicious!!! We had Sam as our chef and he was very enjoyable. We Will be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Listening to your chef talk about politics (specifically Trump), the stock market, and how he wishes you could but you can no longer beat your children because they will call CPS is NOT my idea of an enjoyable night or an appropriate dinner conversation. Very unhappy.  The food is good, expensive, but tasty however I will NEVER return after that"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! $2 California rolls and $6 rainbow roll. Love the meat to rice ratio in the rolls ( loads of meat and very little rice). Sundays from open till 5pm will definitely be doing Sunday Sushi from now on!! For 4 rolls , a green tea and a beer ($2) $20! And delicious!!!"}
{"text":"A little bit on the expensive side, the interior is gorgeous though and the atmosphere is great so the price is justified. The quality of the sushi was really good as well. Overall Osaka is a solid choice when looking for sushi on this side of town."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time and really enjoyed our meals.   Fillet steak, shrimp, salmon, pineapple fried rice, and saut√©ed mixed vegetables.  Very tasty!   The place was clean, service excellent, and affordability priced.  In a great location with plenty of parking.  We will be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"First time here....thought we'd try a new place for a casual anniversary dinner. Mistake!  We were early for dinner time and there were a very small amount of people. One other dining table and one teppan table starting to fill. Service was terrible throughout. Our waitress was attentive at first but while we were ordering she was shouting multiple times at another staffer to tell the cook that more people were being seated at a teppan table.  Someone who was not a waiter was left to serve us and forgot dressing on the salads which wasn't a big deal but it went down from there. The guy behind the sushi bar was hollering at a sports game and clapping loudly as he watched. Staff sat around at the bar doing nothing at all but watch the tv's while they waited for the dinner rush. Ordered calamari first which was really thick rubbery strips. Never had calamari that comes in 1 inch thick strips. The box dinner had dried up, over cooked chicken and totally over fried poststickers....they were literally hard and crunchy. Not a lot of flavor either. Not a quality meal. No one checked up to see if we needed anything and plates weren't cleared from our table at any time even though there were about 6 staffers sitting and standing around. Maybe an off evening for this restaurant but I can say we won't be back again."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on the Yelp reviews. Past Yelppers were right on point. Warmly greeted by the hostess. We were sat quickly and waited on by Alex. He was great. Visited the table often and helped answer a couple of my wife's questions. Recommended a couple of drinks and sushi rolls. They were great as well. We were already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"This review is based on the Teppanyaki side of the restaurant. I made reservations for New Year's Eve only the afternoon before for 5 people at 5pm and even added one more person last minute and it was so easy! I was concerned because I had called Benihana, Ah-So, and Sapporo - my usual go to's but since it was New Year's Eve and last minute none of them could get me in unless it was super early or super late! I am ever so grateful for this because that's how our group ended up at Osaka and we enjoyed our time there!  Our teppanyaki chef was so awesome! He handled our friends' mischievous kids like a boss and for once they didn't have their faces buried in their phones because they were paying attention to our chef!! They were so impressed by his juggling and fire handling skills! The best part of it all is that my Beef filet and lobster were cooked to perfection. Typically, the other teppanyaki places I mentioned always cooked my filet too long and it ends up chewy because they're so busy entertaining too but our chef last night kept my filet medium rare! The fried rice wasn't too salty - I know that depends on the chef. I feel bad because I think he said his name was Jin or Jim but it was so noisy, it was hard to tell! We will definitely try to request him next time we return!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, their food are delicious and we love their happy hour, all you can eat sushi and alcohol:).  This is our new go to place if we wanted sushi especially coming/ moving from the Bay Area.  Love love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in the east valley! My coworkers and I went here for lunch the week before Christmas. We made a reservation as we wanted to be sure we could have lunch in the allotted lunch hour, and they let us place our food orders ahead of time. (If you've ever tried to do a group lunch in this Superstition area in an hour, you know what I'm talking about.) When we arrived, the server took drink orders and began bringing out salads, followed by soups. Pretty much everything on the lunch menu comes with a salad and soup, which makes for plenty of food! The lunch prices were great too, ranging from $7-12, including the teppanyaki dishes. I had 2 maki rolls and both were delicious and fresh. Definitely a place we will do lunch again!"}
{"text":"We had my brothers and sons bday dinner and the food was great and the service was fantastic . We really enjoyed the whole experience was really great . Our waitress was amazing ."}
{"text":"First time today for lunch around 12:45, just missed the lunch rush. Sat in the Teppanyaki Room on the left and had it all to ourself. Very modern and upscale designs on the interior and not loud at all during our visit. The Teppanyaki Table is like getting a free funny show with your dinner, very interactive and fun. Food was delicious and fresh. Preparation time is extremely fast and entertaining. We also had the Shrimp and Veggie Bento Box, and everything in it was excellent! Really nice find for dining in East Mesa. We'll be back a lot!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service is okay. Make sure you check in to take advantage of the ice cream tempura check in offer. I had the pink flamingo roll and is was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, we have tried lots of Japanese steak houses around the valley and this one is our favorite by far.  Great food great service."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The food is delicious. The cooking tables are always energetic. I used to go to drive all the way to the Mesa location. We are so happy to have it just down the street from us. Sunday kids eat free with paid adult. Great place to go when its someones birthday as they sing a song and have masks for you to wear."}
{"text":"Chen, Chen, Chen. He is what makes Osaka so special for me. I would literally follow him to the ends of this Earth as long as he would make me delicious fried rice. I come here at least two times a month and I've had many different Teppanyaki chefs. But Chen makes it perfectly the way I like every time. His performances are always enjoyable to watch too! He flips eggs like a straight BOSS, squirts sake in your mouth and he has the best zucchini aim I've ever witnessed. #TeamChen"}
{"text":"Terrible service! We actually enjoyed going there a couple months back, after going back this past weekend, it has gone down hill! The waitress ( an oriental lady with glasses) was extremely rude to us! We didn't get our drinks for 30 minutes. She questioned my daughters's age for the children's menu.. I was very offended, to say the least. The chefs looked worn out and not as excited anymore. I asked for a manager and nobody in site.. They took my number so he can call me on Monday?? Are you kidding me! We need a new hibachi grill in Peoria/Surprise area!!!!!  Don't go there if you expect good service! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Always had good service and great food. The happy birthday song will be in your head the rest of the night"}
{"text":"Food is good. Huge portions. Been here a couple of times. Quiet place during the week. Except that someone who owns or works here had their kids come in. They sat them directly next to us and were as loud as could be. No consideration for their paying guests. It would be nice to be treated as a patron and not an inconvenience. Was very close to asking for a different table. Literally no boundaries or supervision."}
{"text":"The server that helped me was very polite prompt possum took care of all my needs. She brought me to lunch menu I will be back tomorrow. Excellent food"}
{"text":"Our favorite birthday celebration spot! Our family truly enjoys our everyone we go! We have been here on multiple occasions and I have never left with a complaint everyone from my kids to my parents love it,  it's for all ages!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! They do a great job entertaining everyone with the teppanyaki. They offer a lot of free sake during the cooking of the meal!!! The chef Joe is the best! A very funny and nice guy. The portions are massive. You get soup, salad, meat, fried rice, and grilled veggies. During happy hour they have cheap drink and sushi, the sushi is freshly made and yummy as well. This location is not as crowded as the one in Mesa so the people aren't as fun but the food is still delicious."}
{"text":"Sat on the dining side and while we were seated promptly (to a dirty table that we ha to stand there while she cleaned) it was all downhill from there. Appetizer was undercooked. Drink tasted like straight NyQuil, which I didn't get until reminding her I ordered a drink, and filet mignon was brought to our table COLD. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Foods great, service is good as well. Things have finally come around with new owner transition.  Only wish is that they come up with a little more enticing Happy Hour!!"}
{"text":"Best Teppanyaki around if you like that kind of stuff!!!  My daughter loves it and this is a lot cheaper than Bennihana.  The sushi is pretty solid as well.  They have a great Happy Hour after 2:30 during the week and all day on the weekend.  Cheap drinks and cheap sush, can't go wrong with that!  JM"}
{"text":"Ben is the best bartender. He makes delicious concoctions. He gets to know you and is happy to see you when you come back the next time. I love this place because of Ben's hospitality,  awesome sashimi and sushi and amazing customer service."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious, and I have been angling to go back since experiencing it for the first time. We sat at one of the teppan tables with two other families. One family was a husband and wife; every time our chef pulled out his plastic bottle to squirt saki, the husband took it upon himself to set Olympic records on how long he could make the chef count and pour the saki down his throat. Pretty sure the restaurant lost money on their visit! Haha  The other family included two little girls. The chef pulled out his kid friendly version of the saki (apple juice), and everyone laughed as the older of the two girls tried to beat the husband's record on time. It was kind of a bonding experience.  Meanwhile, I had the chicken and steak, which I thought was pretty safe for a first visit. I was NOT disappointed. The sauces provided were everything, I wanted to keep eating long after my plate was empty! And I could live on the fried rice forever. Our Tappan chef had awesome personality and almost always was able to fling food into the waiting, open mouths of the people beside us (I declined, as I usually don't need help wearing my food). ;)  The only downside is the obnoxious music when it's someone's birthday. They bring out parade faces that the birthday girl or boy dons over their own head. I would be so embarrassed over all the racket, and apparently there were a lot of people with birthdays at the restaurant when we were there. I cringed every time the music started blasting. But then I got distracted by the next round of food!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal.  Good servixe.  Can't ask for more than that.  Great variety, something for everyone!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"We love happy hour! We come pretty often. So easy to feed the kids great food and not break the bank. I love the rolls and cucumber salad. We always order the rock shrimp and beef omurice too. Can't beat it! One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment several times and yesterday will be my last.  Simply put, if you just order cooked food. I think it is perfectly ok.  But there are other locations nearby that is much better than this place if you like fish.  I eat a lot of Sashimi often and always try to be careful where I order them especially in Arizona.  I should have changed my order to something else when the waiter called it \"Sushimi\".  The place tried to dress up the tiny cuts of below average quality fish with mountain of shave ice, blue led light and some decoration that doesn't belong on a plate.  When you put a red lipstick on a bad quality fish it is still a bad quality fish.  There is some orange discoloration on the tuna and they put some kind of sesame oil on the white tuna.  Plus the wasabi tastes & feels like putty.  I was stupid enough to eat them for some reason.  Worst of all I felt sick for the rest of the day after lunch.    Again if one is into \"American\" style teppanyaki, soy sauce flavored fried rice with your choices of meat and happy birthday song.  This might be a place for them.  It is just not a good place for typical traditional Japanese raw fish dishes.  You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Just had some good food. Happen to be in the area for some appointment and thought to get something new to eat."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and their prices are great! I would call the sushi very standard (the specialty rolls were very good) but we were glad to only pay the discounted prices. The pepper tuna appetizer was to die for."}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB!! Happy hour is amazing! David is the best bartender and is as good as it gets! A seat at the bar is a great place to Be! This whole place has everything from drinks, great food, to a fun atmosphere. There sake bombs on happy hour are the best deal in the state! You get a full 22 oz beer along with the sake which is about 4-5 shots! I would highly recommend the omurice as well! Will continue to come back"}
{"text":"A restaurant of Scottsdale caliber here in Mesa. Wow. This place is a total gem. I am so happy we found it!  If you want great food in an upscale place, and don't want to leave Mesa, this is the place!  You can sit in the lounge, at the sushi bar, or at a teppanyaki table.  We sat in the lounge, but saw through a window the teppanyaki side of the restaurant. That is an absolute blast!! The chefs all seem to be extremely entertaining, while being exceptional chefs! We are definitely doing that next time. Hilarious. Especially if there's a birthday... they'll bring a dragon head out and put it on the birthday person, and sing an awesome birthday song. Even we were clapping along. Such a good time! The bartender is fantastic! Rachel pours a mean drink! Happy hour is a absolute bargain for this place. They have $2 domestic beer, or very cheap drinks and food suring happy hour. On Tuesdays, they have $1 saki.  I can't believe how excellent the food is here. The sushi is the best I've had in Arizona, beating Kona Grill and everywhere else we've eaten in Scottsdale easily. We are definitely going to be regulars here.  I can't say enough how exceptional this place is. We will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"We visited Osaka for the first time last Saturday on my Birthday.  I had a birthday coupon for a free Teppan meal.  It was delicious and the chef made the experience so much fun.  The free squirt (shot) of sake for the adults & lemonade for the kids was fun.  The fried rice and everything else was delicious!  So much food, I had tons of leftovers.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excuse me Morpheus is calling --- Yes I don't think the Machines really know what good food taste like --- Yes, yes, yeah I know chicken haha!  Silly Machines!  I say this in a good way.  Osaka, Japan, or Mesa, Arizona, Close enough right?  Let's not get too carried away!  Osaka Japanese Steakhouse is a Teppanyaki restaurant so don't forget to make your reservations!  Yes, this place can get full real especially during dinner hour on the weekends.   OJS, serves up a modern Japanese cuisine.  The decors are very elegant, yet has a traditional appeal.  The place itself has a real contemporary feel.  Think Matrix with Japanese flare!  Minus, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, though I wouldn't mind seeing some butt kicking action.    I ordered the Yakisoba with Ramen noodles and beef.  Let's just say it literally looked like the opened up a bag of ramen and stir-fried it with some beef.  It was really bland, but luckily my friend had a packet of spicy sauce in her purse.  Yeah, I know in her purse!  I had to douse it with some soy sauce to give it an extra saltiness and I never add soy sauce to anything!  Needless to say, my noodles were under par.  I think I could have made it myself and I don't cook.  I don't know about their Teppanyaki, but if it's anything like their noodles then I don't think I'll be making reservations anytime soon. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome Japanese steakhouse!!!better then Benihana! Eric was our  teppananki chef and was amazing!so happy I live so close to here! Hope this place succeeds. The only negative about it is the server was kinda slow but nothing crazy. See you guys next week!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is a little pricey but I think it is worth the money. I have only tried the Teppenyaki so far but every time has been a real treat. It is a great place for a date night."}
{"text":"This is the best teppanyaki place in Chandler! We used to go to the one in Mesa because nothing in Chandler compared (and we tried THREE other teppanyaki places) and we were so happy when this one opened. Went there for my birthday this week and had outstanding service! When they know it's your birthday they take extra great care of you. The restaurant is super clean, staff is exceptionally friendly, service is fast and so accommodating. We have a child with a beef, milk and egg allergy and they took extra care to ensure there was no cross contamination whatsoever. The food was outstanding! I had the filet mignon and chicken combo and it was cooked to perfection. Also had the white peach saki and it was delicious too. If you're a fan of any of the other teppanyaki places in town definitely give this one a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Gilbert. The happy hour is amazing. Service? is great!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, service was great, and had a blast! So glad to have had good company while enjoying the entertainment of our cook at the grill. Only complaint was that the food had a little too much soy sauce or whatever sauce they used that made it salty... But other than that it was amazing! Definitely will come again :)"}
{"text":"I can't say that I have done their tempanayaki before so I cannot rate them on that. I usually order my rolls to go and I have always been very satisfied. The service is fast and my rolls are always fresh and tasty. I ordered the Fatboy roll today and it was delicious ! I have never been disappointed.  I only wish they would have more specials or something because 15 dollars for 1 roll is expensive. I would come here more often if the price was a little less, but the quality is great."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here today. I frequently visit their 60 FRWY and Power location. Our new go to place!"}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day this year. They had GREAT food and outstanding service! They handled the craziness of valentines with ease."}
{"text":"Reservations on Sunday Dec 17th were not handled well.  My party of 5 was not seated until 1 hour AFTER our 5:30pm reservation.  Hostess had an attitude when we would inquire on status.  Manager was not very helpful in assisting.  No compensation was offered for the delay (one round of drinks, free appetizer, etc) which would have gone a long way. I cannot image a Friday or Saturday night and how reservations are handled."}
{"text":"Great food, their fried rice was seriously the best, next time I'm gonna get the steak medium instead of medium rare, it was a little too rare for me, but everything was excellent. Super fun date night!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple times. The food has been fine, service has been slow. This visit can be summed up with two words... frozen salmon.   Literally served four pieces of frozen salmon sashimi on the plate. Not really cold salmon, frozen solid salmon. I politely pointed it out to the server and she called the manager over who proceeded to lecture me about the salmon.   Well, he certainly made his point... I hope it was worth it. No tip and I'll never be back."}
{"text":"We were part of a large party and ended up waiting over 3 hrs after being seated and placing our order for a cook to come cook our food. Zero showmanship, zero of the extras you expect from an authentic Japanese grill. To top the night off, the cook took food from a dirty plate that had been used and put it on my friend's plate. She tried to stop him but he proceeded to pile tainted food onto my poor table mate's plate. She was so grossed out that she stopped eating. She asked for a box to go but they gave her a $10 off her next visit instead. Very poor and unforgiveable service from what should be a top notch place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to this place for months. So glad we finally did! Great atmoshere, food and service.  Intimate, beautiful atmosphere. Portions are huge so plan on sharing. LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Great Night Celebrating Valentines, 17th  Wedding Anniversary and 5th Birthday. We had a group of 8 people. For such a busy night we were seated about 15 minutes later than reservation and we though that was really good we had a cocktail in bar area. Once seated our server immediately got drink orders and appetizers going and took our entree orders. We sat at the Teppanyaki table and our cook Alex did a great job. We have eaten here many times but this night the food was the best ever. Alex seasoned and cooked everything perfectly.  Not too salty and everything was fresh and yummy. The show was great and the birthday singing was lots of fun. We had a great night. We would highly recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"I come in atleast once a month, and sit up at the sushi bar in hopes that my favorite sushi chef is working, Summer. My boyfriend and I always get the same rolls, osaka, firedragon (which they don't have at this location unless you ask), mama mia roll and then whatever my boyfriend feels like that day. Don't forget to order their garlic edamame,delicious! Atmosphere is pretty laid back and fun, especially when you hear the birthday song in the teppanyaki room with everyone celebrating. Only downside is they're pretty disorganized still, we will be greeted twice or asked for our order twice, but i guess thats better than not having anyone care for us..  Sushi rolls here are filling and delicious, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. The food is fantastic - I've never had a bad experience with their food, from the edamame to the mochi and all points in between. Prices aren't bad, either, unless you're like my family ordering WAY too many rolls (we can't help it - they're delish!). And, of course, the service is fantastic - especially when compared to the other sushi place in the same complex, which has the worst service I've ever experienced at any restaurant. If you're looking for delicious sushi (I've never tried the grill) in the far east valley, Osaka is your spot."}
{"text":"This review is solely on their service.  I made reservations for a party of 12 on a Wednesday night at 7pm. Two of us arrived about 5 minutes before 7pm and checked in at the front. The hostess said to let her know once the rest of our party has arrived. We checked in with her again at 7:00 because more than half of our party was there already. She said she couldn't seat us until everyone was there.  Fine. So we continued to wait. By 7:05pm, everyone had arrived and we alerted the hostess. Apparently they gave away our table to another big party because their entire party was there before ours.  We had to wait another 30minutes before we were seated. Mind you this was a weekday night that wasn't even busy! We were the only party waiting. What is the point of making a reservation if it isn't honored? This establishment needs to learn what it means to take reservations or don't accept them all together.  By the time we were seated, everyone was irritated and hungry which set the mood for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"We had hibachi and it was fantastic.  I had the filet and my husband had the swordfish.  It was prepared to exact perfection.  The chef gave a good show, and the portions where bigger than anywhere I've ever been.   They do not offer an alternative for the dressing on the salad but their ginger dressing is better than any I've had before.  We will definitely be returning and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place was very entertaining. I had the chicken and steak and it was delicious. The service was incredible. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We come in at least once a week for Sushi. Always a pleasant experience. Love the atmosphere! The sushi is delicious. Happy hour from  4-6 and reverse from  9-10 pm,. Its a must try! Someday I plan to try the rest of the menu. Stuck on their Sushi won't it eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people... Drove by this place so many times and finally decided to try it! We decided to do the teppanyaki. My fianc√© and i ordered the teppanyaki dinner for 2 and we were able to choose 4 different types of meat.. We choose the sirloin, shrimp, calamari, & swordfish... Our food was amazing! The sirloin calamari & swordfish was out favs!! It was $52 for both of us which isn't too bad.. We expected to pay more for the teppanyaki.... Definitely better than Benihana!! Will probably come back!"}
{"text":"So this place recently opened and is very close to where I work,so I had to try it. I have been here twice now and both times have received excellent service and had fantastic food. The first occasion was for dinner,and I had steak and shrimp teppan yaki,apologies if I've butchered that spelling. It was delicious and of course entertaining,complete with the chef adding lots of sake via a squirt bottle directly into the mouth. The next time was for lunch,and I ordered a steak bento box. For $10 you really can't beat the amount of food,and again the service was fantastic. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"The food was great but by far the most terrible service ever! Took 40 minutes for three appetizers ( there were only a total of five tables, mine included) and three servers. Throughout the night two of the servers just stood by the kitchen being lazy as could be. Our server could not remember what the three customers (me and friends)had ordered and had us indicated in the receipt what we ordered. Keep in mind it was only three appetizers, 3 drinks, one entree and three rolls of sushi(which only had gotten two). I would not recommend this place.  A family of four next to us was also getting impatient and annoyed how long it took for everything."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with alot of fun thrown in. We really enjoyed our evening celebrating a friend's birthday. We feasted on food prepared with great humor, right there infront of us on the hot plate. Flames and flying shrimp! Good quality fillet, mahi mahi, salmon, chicken, shrimp...cooked perfectly. Lots of saki and fun. Great dessert birthday cake."}
{"text":"Came here the last couple of times for sushi and just wanted to say that the oyster quality was not as good; they did not taste as fresh and they were served to us warm two times. On one particular occasion we ordered sweet shrimp for the first time, and it also came warm. We told the manager and he was nice about it and had them make us another order, but those also came warm.  The rice on all the sushi was also subpar and kept falling apart. In the end, the manager ended up taking them off our bill and giving us a gift card, so I have no complaints about the customer service. Overall, I have noticed that I only have bad experiences here during busy hours, such as at dinner, but whenever I come for lunch I rarely have a complaint.  So just be aware of this if you ever decide to come on a Friday or Saturday at dinner time."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Love this place, and so do all of my friends and family! Do yourself a favor and go sit at the teppanyaki grill! You will not be disappointed. If you are looking for sushi,teppanyaki, or both this is the place to go to. Hands down the best sushi in Az."}
{"text":"Not worth it! Go somewhere else. I went later in the evening but did not feel overly welcomed. Got the Phoenix roll and the las Vegas roll but was disappointed to see they were mostly game crab meat and the Phoenix roll was too big to eat because half of it was \"crab\". Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because it was fresh. Been eating sushi a long time and u was greatly disappointed with what I was served, I took a lot of the crab off."}
{"text":"I came back for the teppanyaki. It was way better than my previous experience. The service was better and environment livelier. The man in charge of our food was super engaging and had a very engaging personality. He was awesome. Our waitress was on top of everything. I'd definitely recommend the teppanyaki side. We came on a weekday and it was busy so a reservation wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate my birthday here, which was a Wednesday, with a few friends. While the teppanyaki was good and watching the chef was entertaining, I had an overall bad experience.   We ordered over $100 in food, plus drinks.. Because we were drinking a bit and talking, we all ate only about 25% of our food so we asked for to-go boxes. We boxed and bagged our food, and left. Within only 10 minutes of leaving, we realized no one grabbed the bag of food. I immediately called and the host informed me they threw away our food already. For a restaurant not being that busy on a Wednesday, especially after taking the time and effort to bag the food, you would think they'd have the common sense to hold the food at the host stand for a reasonable amount of time, regardless!   I spoke to the manger and all they would offer is a $15 voucher. We've already ate and celebrated 4 parties here and the mesa location combined. I don't think I'll return nor my friends or family for insulting us with $15 for the amount of money we spent and food they threw quickly without consideration. Fun spot, but unfortunately lacking in costumer service 101 skills."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi, beautiful presentation. I suggest this location as a great HH option. The bartenders are awesome and attentive. There are tepenyaki tables on the opposite side of the bar but you don't deal with excessive smoke and the smell. I suggest the Osaka roll, American roll and the Martz. I highly recommend OSAKA."}
{"text":"Osaka is the best Teppanyaki deal in the valley. The lunch special is only $16 for fillet mignon and only $18 for a combination, we got shrimp with our steak. The service is fast and friendly. We love this place."}
{"text":"We tried both sushi and teppanyaki choices. Overall, all are delicious as well as larger than average plate size. Also, the staff was very friendly, kind and show all their enthusiasm to make the guests happy. The shows on the teppanyaki grills were terrific. The most enjoyable one that I have ever experienced, not only for just the kids but also adults as well."}
{"text":"We had such a fantastic time here. The show was better than Benihana and other teppanyaki places we've been. Our chef was hilarious and fun. Saw new things we haven't seen elsewhere. The birthday song was fun, it's was my birthday. The food was ready too. The chicken was prepared teriyaki style, better than most places I've been to. The filet, shrimp and calamari were all fantastic. Great job. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Chefs are always talentes. Food always amazing!  The shrimp and filet combo is my fav! The jalape√±os are amazin too!   Place gets busy though, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal at the cooking table. Beef melts in your mouth. Chicken flavor was perfect as well as the shrimp. The veggies were flavorful and excellent fried rice. What a fun meal, too. Our cook was entertaining as well as a great cook. I did order the free dessert and it was a large portion and very tasty. Lots of fun-one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Gave four stars because it took a few minutes before  we were acknowledged when we first walked into the restaurant.  However once we were noticed and seated the service was amazing.  My husband and I went at about 4:30 on a Saturday for an early dinner.  They were not busy at all. We were seated at the hibachi table and were the only ones. The waitress was very knowledgeable and wanted to make sure my shellfish allergies were taken care of. Our chef was Joe.  He was funny and the perfect hibachi chef. I loved the food. It was delicious.  I had the steak and chicken. My steak got cooked perfectly.  The experience and everything will make this a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Avocado salad is to die for. The area outside near that part of the freeway does kind of have a funky smell though. Not the restaurant's fault, but it is unappetizing walking in to get sushi."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Our server was named David and he was awesome! Happy hour is the best $3-8 dollars for sushi and it's so filling! Way better than kona or blue, found my new favorite sushi place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation online and come to find out their online booking system had a glitch.  We had the email confirmation on our phone but nothing showed up on their end.  End result was that we would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated in the hibachi area.  They didn't offer to do anything to keep us besides say sorry so we didn't hesitate to stay there and wait.  We walked right across the street to Firebirds and had a wonderful dinner. Walked right in to Firebirds w/o a reservation and was seated just like that.  Osaka, please think about having more than 2 chefs on a FRIDAY night as no one in our party of 6 will be returning."}
{"text":"We loved eating here for my husbands birthday!! It's pretty expensive but so worth it. The dining experience kept us laughing and entertained. It even kept my 16 month old sons attention, which is amazing. Food was tasty and sake delicious! We are looking forward to going back with family and friends next time! Way better than Benihana!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The show chef was hilarious and talented. Also all of the food was absolutely great."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant, but wasn't really impressed. Maybe would've had a better experience if we sat at the Teppanyaki tables rather than by the bar. We self sat by the bar lounge area at a high top. There was no one that identified themselves as our server for about 15 minutes and finally we called someone over to ask if we could get help. He said that our server would be out in a moment and he went to go get him. Once our server finally came out the service wasn't bad. I have heard great things about the food, but it was pretty standard in my opinion. The sushi was flavorful, but seemed too Americanized for my taste. Fried rice was flavorful and don't get me wrong I love butter, but the rice looked and tasted like it was dripping it fat. Best thing I ate was the combo tempura, the breading was light and crispy and the inside wasn't too dried out. Overall a decent meal for a decent price."}
{"text":"I found Osaka Japanese Steakhouse on Yelp and we decided to take my mom here for Mother's Day.  Not only was the food delicious, our chef was hilarious!  My 6 yr old nephew declared this to be his absolute favorite place to eat!!  We ordered a variety of items including the chicken, filet and scallop teppanyaki along with a couple rolls and calamari.  I highly recommend everything we ordered!  We also received salad, miso soup and got to sample the shrimp teppanyaki.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is great at this place the service needs work.  We waited over 20 min for a drink menu then another 10 just to see our server take someone else's order and still not even bring water. This is the second time we have been and enjoyed the food but was extremely disappointed at how we were served.  The last time the waiter just left and never came back."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat! Even though my son has a mild reaction to fish he orders the steak and it's always cooked to perfection and not over done!"}
{"text":"We order take out on occasion and normally it's pretty good! Tonight was the exception. We order bentos which come with a salad, soup, the bento which consists of a roll, meat, rice, and gyoza and then a separate container of tempura. First off, I open one of the salads and it's literally got 4 pieces of lettuce, 1 grape tomato and 1 slice of cucumber. The dressing is good though. My husband gave me his and even with 2, it barely filled the styrofoam container. Next, we didn't get any tempura sauce, just 2 cups of soy sauce. My husband ordered the pork Katsu which is supposed to come with a thicker bbq like sauce and that was nowhere to be seen. Lastly, the miso soup was NOT miso soup, it was a mushroom variety and just not good. I was sorely disappointed as they've been pretty consistent in the past. For $45 dollars for both meals, I'd expect more care. So next time, we will check our bag before we go. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The guy had the grill too high and slightly burnt most of our food. Sushi looked pretty good, but I didn't try it. We'll be sticking with Ah So as their food is much better tasting."}
{"text":"I ordered the Yaki Soba. Nothing like what you get in Japan. Kind of disappointing. Tasted like top ramen soup.  Otherwise, what the rest of the family got looked great. Chef was humorous and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome venue and atmosphere. This is a great place for a celebration or birthday. Yes they play a birthday song for every birthday but that makes this place unique. Its fun and the face masks are hilarious.   We ordered the Calamari rings which the portions were little (but with the rest of your food trust me you won't be hungry). As for the teppanyaki, we got two orders of the Steak and chicken to split between 4 people. There is a $7 share fee but this is so both people can get the salad, rice, and soup with the grilled meats. Well worth the cost. Everything was delicious. I suggest you try everything with their \"Yum Yum\" sauce/ White Sauce (even though they tell you its for seafood). Over all very entertaining.  If I had to pick a negative, I didn't like that they pressured you to take the sake. We had to pretend we weren't 21 to get out of it. It is a fun thing for the restaurant but no means no. But on a positive note, it's cute they do the same for the kids, but in a baby bottle filled with Mountain Dew."}
{"text":"Osaka's rocks! We go for all my family's Birthday as well as 3 years in a row on New Years Eve. I don't mind having to wait a few minutes because the teppanyaki is so fresh and amazing. My husband loves Mahi-mahi and said it is one of the best he has ever have! That says a lot as he is from Oregon!! Thank you Osaka for being a part of our celebrations!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! The food is so fresh, staff are amazing, atmosphere is great as well. My husband had the Mahi Mahi, he said it is one of the best cuts of fish he has ever had. That is saying alot as he is from the Pacific Northwest! This is our favorite restaurant that we live by!!!"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki is always delicious here, just like benihana but cheaper price. It's always a fun time!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to make about this place. They steam the rice and make it purple which is kind of a cool signature move but sort of just as distracting. The rolls are slightly overpriced for what you get but pretty tasty. It is getting 3 stars because I was there I had two small children with me and I ordered miso soup and an appetizer first and that was the last thing that came out. I almost held the servers Hand by saying put that in first and yet she still couldn't get it out. And then pour salt in the wound even more she said there's one guy in the kitchen and he's slow. Totally unacceptable communication."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for fun and great food and just a great experience then this is the right place to go. My wife and I have eaten here several times and we love it."}
{"text":"My review is only based on the bar during the week  :)  Been here twice and each time the service was great, thanks Tony!  Super friendly staff and beautiful decor inside.    Currently their happy hour is from 2:30-6pm, I think they'd get more business extending it possibly to 7pm, I'd go!  I'm looking forward to bringing some friends for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Will not come back here again. We waited 2 hours to get all if our meals. We felt bad for the manager; they should hire more people."}
{"text":"I've been to several other teppanyaki experiences before, and I would consider this one to be middle of the pack. The host and chef were both very personable. The chef had great showman skills, but it felt like he didn't spend too much time playing around with us. He tossed vegetables up in the air for those who wanted to catch them with their mouth, and of course, did the sake squirt bottle. If you do not wish to drink sake, they also have a lemonade bottle. Other than the traditional onion choo-choo and the cool egg breaking/dicing part, that was pretty much the extent of the \"show.\"  If you have a birthday they will give you a crazy mask to wear, bang a drum and sing loudly. As other reviews mention, this will happen throughout your visit at most of the other tables too. Osaka will also give the birthday person a complimentary dessert, which is nice of them, but not the tastiest thing you'll ever eat.   The food: our group had steak and chicken. Both were cooked to order. I liked the steak, but the chicken was bland. They give you sauce to dip it in, but it didn't quite erase the blandness. The fried rice they made at the table was very good though.The cup of soup they bring out was fine, but the salad was not good. (A lot of unattractive iceberg lettuce- tons of white and brown parts - with a few extra veggies thrown in.)   All in all, it has a festive vibe going on. It might be fun if your group fills a table, and if you have some boisterous people in your group. It's super loud in there, so you won't really be conversing with your table mates much. The food is serviceable. Lastly, the staff that helped us all seemed to be nice and do a good job."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch, and had a nice experience.  After we sat down and ordered, a server brought us complimentary edamame.  The edamame was nice and warm, we ate it all.  Next, out came our soup and salad.  I enjoyed the soup and the salad, but I didn't finish my salad as I am not used to getting both.  We order four rolls, they were two for $7.50, and they came out two rolls to a plate.  I meant to take pictures, but it slipped my mind since I was immersed in conversation.   We ordered the Boston, the Alaska, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Shrimp rolls.  The rolls were a nice lunch size and they were very nicely made.  I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed each roll, we finished them all.   The servers were attentive, they refilled our water glasses often and they came by to check in us every once in a while.  We paid with a coupon, and we did not receive any flack.  When I ordered water, they asked if I wanted lemon which I appreciated because I like my water pain.  I was surprised they offered the dessert menu, I'd already looked it over, because I generally have to ask.   When you walk in the entrance, there is a little pond with fish that is nice to look addy if you have to wait.  They have mints at the hostess stand for when you leave, but no trashcan near the door.  The dining room was spacious, yet private.    The reason I only gave four stars, after we paid nobody checked on us or tried to fill our waters.  My glass was mostly ice, so that was the only downfall, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour! Love the Rock Shrimp & Fried Shrimp Shumai. Las Vegas is really good 2!"}
{"text":"A Fantastic Japanese restaurant we visited on a weekday night.  We started off with the side order of the beef and it was very delicious.  I tried the Katana drink (so good!) and the Tokyo tea (Happy hour special) and they were very rewarding. Prepared well.  Of course, we tried 4 sushi rolls. The crazy roll, the godzilla, spicy salmon, and Tequila. They were all finely prepared and brought out on one large plate. The presentation was great.  The service was fine. Only hiccup was the waiter didn't mention it was happy hour. However, he was very professional and positive.   The total bill was around 60, so it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to stop here for an impromptu dinner this evening. First impressions were not that great as hubby got up to use the restroom and came back not at all pleased. He said the restroom was nasty and pointed out bits of food that were stuck to the chairs on the tables around us.  We sat in the bar area and the place was pretty empty. We both ordered iced teas to start as well as the Golden Spider sushi roll to share. The roll was very good and I would definitely order it again. I ordered the sashimi dinner box and hubby ordered the peppered steak dinner box. Both of our meals started with a salad and miso soup. I really liked the salad dressing on the salad while the miso soup was just OK. Our meals came and I was delighted to see what they put before us. I had opted for the upgraded fried rice and I'm glad I did. It had a really good flavor to it although it was just a bit too greasy. Our meals also came with tempura vegetables, a California roll, and two fried gyozas. It was definitely a ton of food and neither one of us was able to finish it all. We couldn't help seeing the chocolate cake martini on the drink list and decided to order one of these for our dessert. It was very creamy and very tasty and a delightful way to end our meal. Our check came and not only had the guy overcharged us for our martinis he circled the area on the receipt that gave suggested tip amounts. Needless to say this really turned us off and caused hubby to tip him just a bit less because of it. While hubby was taking care of the check I took my turn in the restroom and I agreed that the housekeeping left a lot to be desired. Walking out of the restroom I noticed how much my shoes stuck to the floor and one could hear me coming for quite some time. So the final verdict: The food was really good and we would go again for it; however they really need to get a handle on their house keeping as well as their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I ever had! I literally didn't eat most of my sushi and didn't bother with a to-go box....it was that bad! Was in a large group doing teppanyaki. The group didn't seem to be wild about the food either. The drink I had was really good though. By the way the food wasn't cheap.....after 2 rolls, a drink, and the 18% included group gratuity, I was out $36 :/"}
{"text":"Came for the sushi! I'm an avid lover for sushi and dying to find the best sushi spot. I had the : hurricane roll and vegas roll for lunch. Let me tell you it was AMAZING I've s ever had a Vegas roll that taste like this.    The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the host wasn't very inviting. I sat at the sushi bar and waited forever to order my food when there was barely anyone here.   I highly recommend the Vegas roll bomb.com"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!!!!  A top notch habachi/teppanyaki place. I especially like the lunch special, which is a bargain!  Full service chef, show and all, and for very very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Great service. Great food. Kids have a good time. And I'm not even on the tepanyaki side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great, big portions. Happy hour all day on Saturday was a surprise. It had a good variety. Call ahead to reserve your grill. We shared a table with a couple us made 7 they charge gratuity anyway. It may have been a charge for the grill. Either way we had a great experience."}
{"text":"I wanted something fun for my birthday, something my kids would enjoy as much as I did. Coming here was definitely the right decision. The boys enjoyed the show at the grill, even if they were splitting a bento box, and I got to have some sushi (the rest of our party had teppanyaki). The sushi was very good, and the samples I had of my grandmother's teppan salmon were delicious. All in all, a fun birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had. The food was great and the staff was very attentive.  Great NYE night out."}
{"text":"We came for a graduation party and had a great time with a large group! The food and service were great and fast. Thanks for hosting our party for a great time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place really is as good as it gets.  The food is spectacular, the fried rice is amazing and we always get the filet and it truly is melt in your mouth.  Great fun and close to home.  The east valley is lucky to have Osaka here!!  Go check it out"}
{"text":"Decided to go here for lunch with the kids. We ordered the dinner box (pork tonkotsu) as well as a salmon skin roll, eel avocado roll, and spider roll. The service was kind of slow and the first things to come out were the rolls. They were decently made well (rice to content ratio) however the sushi rice that was used was pretty mushy (usually a bad sign). The dinner box was sadly the most disappointing...the pork was really over cooked and very dry. The tempura shrimp and veggies was alright and the gyoza was soggy (not sure but they left it swimming in sauce instead of keeping it separate and crunchy). Given the price and the quality of the food I sadly will not likely return. There's definitely better options out there as well in the sushi/teppanyaki genre."}
{"text":"When I came here the first time, I had sushi albeit skeptical about having \"fresh\" fish. However, it exceeded my expectations. The sushi tasted pretty fresh AND checking in gave me a free tempura ice cream, which is so yum. The second time I got a chicken teriyaki meal. It was pretty good except the chicken was a little dry. The only negative is that it is a little pricey for dinner and on weekends. The weekday lunch meal is a decent price."}
{"text":"We went there mid-week just before the lunch service closed in order to take advantage of the half price menu. We found ourselves the only patrons in the place which we found a bit odd, but our little group of three thoroughly enjoyed the teppenyaki chef and the excellent food. The filet was so tender, shrimp not overcooked and veggies done perfectly. If we lived nearby I'm sure we'd be going for the lunch deal frequently. Same menu as dinner, just half the price. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very attentive and polite. Happy hour on weekdays is 230-6 and weekends is open-5. We got 3 rolls of sushi at $6 each, an appetizer for $4, a crab salad for $3, blue moon for $2, and a free tempura ice cream( I unlocked the yelp deal) all for only $30! We were too full to eat all the sushi but this place was awesome."}
{"text":"I been here few time and I love the Himachi Kama is good. You Gotta try the Osaka roll it's awesome and the staff little funny :)"}
{"text":"Just went for 1st time today, for lunch. Everything was great. Good service and great food. Good value for the price. Filet was tender and cooked just right.  Really enjoyed ourselves. Will be back again for lunch. Thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, their lunch menu was very affordable and lots of options to choose from. If you want sushi or something hot off the grill, this is a great lunch place. Traffic is very busy off bell but restaurant is very quiet during lunch hours. Although restaurant wasn't very busy, servers need to be a little attentive to customers. All together, great menu for lunch and choices for happy hour. Big rooms to cater to big party as well."}
{"text":"We have tried a few other places since moving to the valley looking for comparable quality and flavor to our two favorite teppanyaki restaurants in Florida. The food, the atmosphere and the people to include the patrons made this place an instant favorite! The scallops were huge, the shrimp flavorful and my daughters chicken was awesome! The rice...what can I say about the rice beside more please! We will go back soon! Hands down one of the best meals we've had since moving here."}
{"text":"Went their for birthday celebrations last Saturday and it was one of the worst customer service experiences ever.  The 2 stars are bc the food was good but the service was TERRIBLE! Waited 45 minutes for our table with a reservation. What is the point in a reservation if it means nothing and they don't prepare your table till after you get there? Then the birthday girl had to wait over an hour for a drink, it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been going to this style of restaurant for 25+ plus years & I'm in the restaurant business. This place is #1, no contest in the Phx area. Service, food, chefs, & sushi chefs are amazing."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's fine if you love Sake bombers, Asian bar culture or sushi.  Or are coming with a group for a teppanyaki show. But for impromptu dining..... it needs to be passed over. Came here with my husband,  2 1/2 hour wait for a teppanyaki table,  but 5 minute wait for a regular table.   I should've guessed then. A 10 minute wait for sodas, another 10 minutes and our orders taken,  salad and soup arrived quickly, but salad was iceberg lettuce with bottled thousand island dressing (think of in-and-out burger flavor without the burger), then a 35 minute wait for entrees.  That would not be a problem if the food  was stellar, but see my pic.  For my entree about 2 oz of steak with 2 cups of rice for $16.00.  Steak with no salt or seasoning,  only a sweet teriyaki sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds although it was served medium rare as I asked.   Rice had a lot of garlic flavor,  but no other seasoning. My husband was ok with his udon soup and shrimp, but commented he could get the same at a Yogi' s. I've eaten at the original Benihana's in Seattle, and Sapporo in Scottsdale, so I know what semi-decent Japanese food is supposed to be.  Final check with tip  $47.00.  2 entrees, 2 sodas.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"New restaurants have a lot to prove. That is why they fail so quick. Here is a perfect example of what could have been. Thought for certain that this would have been a good experience, Instead, I got bad service, mediocre food and a Benihana-like show that seemed forced. Had sushi and was served last after all the cooked meals were delivered. Waitress kept making the same claim that the food would be right out, but no delivery. We don't want excuses, We want food. I give them two months more before they become something else. Avoid it."}
{"text":"This place is excellent when you eat at the teppanyaki. The meat is red, the shrimp are raw, the chicken is clean, overall everything is so fresh the taste is all there when they cook it. It's just amazing, and it's also a great place if you are celebrating a birthday!"}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI IN AZ. Even their kitchen food is amazing. You can't get something bad and they have fun drinks. On tuesdays they have $1 saki and it comes in all different flavors! The bartender David is the best dude in that place and got along with everyone else working there as well. Great environment and great prices."}
{"text":"Best dinner experience I've ever had! Tom was absolutely amazing!! He definitely made our dinner a fun one! We had a party of 11 so we were lucky to have him all to ourself.  It was my hubby's birthday so they do shoot saki into everyone's mouths and give a little extra to the bday boy! Tom gave us an amazing show and had us laughing the whole time. He was great at multi tasking while he was cooking, because our food still came out amazing! The fried rice was my favorite of the night. The white sauce they use was great with the rice.   Drinks are really good here too. If you need a place to celebrate a birthday or anything this is definitely the place! Way better than Benihana!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  One of the best secrets in Arrowhead mall area."}
{"text":"We had a great time. Outstanding service. We had a reservation and was taken right in. Our chef was entertaining.  The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Still really love this place but a little disappointed in some recent takeout. Ordered curry rice and this is seriously what we got. Not sure if they get props for not hiding the truth, or if they don't deserve them for using curry sauce in a packet instead of making it."}
{"text":"Bomb food! And entertainment while you eat with the chef cooking in front of us. This was my first experience with this type of dining. Def will be making this a \"to go\" place for the family."}
{"text":"I took my girls for lunch on Sunday.  They do not have the lunch menu on Sundays.  But they offered us a special on teppanyaki - Get a dinner teppanyaki 50% off with a drink, which is a pretty good deal.  The food was okay.  It was not as greasy as Ah-So's teppanyaki.  Three of us ordered salmon, chicken and beef.  The meat tasted plain.  If you want teppanyaki, order salmon.  My daughter who does not like cooked fish ate it because she liked it better than chicken and beef.  The service was slow even though there weren't many customers.    Don't order a smoothie drink!  It did not taste like a real one.  They put a lot of syrup.  Plus it is expensive for a fake drink.  I might go back to try non-teppanyaki menus to compare with other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Just another Benihana's. Pretty much same service same \"show\" same food. Wanted a simple dining night and got put into a large group seating arrangement."}
{"text":"David(THE MAIN MAN), Stryker(new guy), Alex(oldie, but goodie), and Tony(the GM)... All great stagg, and all personable in their own ways, and gotta love and appreciate how genuine and great they are! :D    Can't wait to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here in 17 days! [:"}
{"text":"Worse calamari of my life. What such I place gives the salad with ranch, miso soup tastes like powder. The guy making the sushi is taking shots of saki when we have been waiting 30 min for our sushi. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Osaka is always great! Teppanyaki is a must. The filet, chicken, and shrimp are my favorites. My husband, daughter, and I went for Valentine's Day and the hostess presented my daughter and I with a rose as we were seated."}
{"text":"My stepson is 19. Holy cow...19. when asked where he would like his birthday lunch, he chose Osaka for the Teppanyaki. He also wanted Teppanyaki for his grandparents, in from California. The restaurant is always clean. The food was amazing, as usual. The chef was personable and talented, keeping the table engaged as well as well-fed.  Here's what brought the rating down. The hostess was rude. We informed her that our party was all present. Grandma then went to the restroom at the time our Teppan was ready. The hostess was snippy and questioned us again where our last person in the party was.  Also, we had a horrible server...don't know his name, but he reminded us of Jonah Hill. He sat at the Teppan with us, and with elbows on the table, loudly mocked our chef, who ignored his fodder.   The chef then asked if there were any birthdays or celebrations. We told him that there was a birthday, and he promptly informed [so called] Jonah, who rose from the table with an annoyed raise of the hand and a loud sigh. Sorry to bother you with our celebration, dude.  The meal was great. Then, the bill comes our way. Grandma asks about the birthday song that still hasn't happened. [Jonah] looks at her, very irritated and asks \"Oh, you still want that?\" She responds, and he turns on the song for a moment and drops the party head on our son. He advises no other servers and stands there for the song to be over in a half-assed gesture of which he clearly wanted no part.  This sad excuse for customer service representatives - waitstaff being a face of the establishment - has tarnished what has been, for our family, a stand-by for birthdays, special occasions, and even regular days when you need a pick-me-up. This server, especially, needs to be broken down to bus boy, if he keeps his job at all, until he learns what the service industry is all about."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! I never leave reviews but had to after our mothers day was ruined. Hibachi went fine, until we ordered some additional items. Items never came and we were charged for them. Asked waiter about it, long story short ended up waiting for an entire hour to get my bill fixed. Asked for a manager and was informed that.... And I quote.... \"everyone is quitting so you can't talk to a manager.\" they then offered a $10 off coupon, then when I said I would never return they gave me two $5 bills. When I called back to ask for a manager again I was told that the owner had been present during my visit, had stayed in his office instead of talking with me, and had sent me the $10 concession prize. So all in all spent almost 3 hours at this restaurant to get some tiny portions of admittedly good food. Not worth it. I can understand why everyone was quitting"}
{"text":"Our favorite tempanyaki place around. Good chefs that put on a great show. We love the white sauce and free saki."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had. Both of us enjoyed it. The fried rice had pineapple, which was different but surprisingly delicious. The prices at first seemed a bit high, then we found the happy hour menu and were very happy with the prices, especially with the quality."}
{"text":"I love going here for happy hour (2:30-6) on the weekdays. It's never very busy and the rolls are large - three usually fill two of us up. We enjoy the Mesa, citrus and Las Vega although we haven't tried one that we don't like. Food can come out pretty slow (30 mins on a weekday) but I think it's because they plate all the rolls together. Otherwise, it's great!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, awesome atmosphere. Love bringing my family here. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Looks nice on the outside but food tastes numb and void, no taste, panda is a lot better!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge teppan fan. I must say this place has great, fresh and amazing food.  Service was great too.  I am never a fan of the white based sauces however."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place.  Staff is super friendly, food is good, sushi is fresh and tasty.  Nothing negative to say, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came on a Monday when they were offering a half price special and we were very happy with what we got for the money we spent. They serve a small portion of edamame for free and the rolls were a pretty decent size. The service didn't blow us away but it wasn't anything to ruin what was an otherwise pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi place! The rolls were amazing. Maybe could be a bit smaller (they were huge) but so delicious!"}
{"text":"Both of our birthdays are I Feb, so got two 25 dollars off for taipanyakki. Soooo good! They gave my husband two little chocolate cakes and light a candle for him. Really nice! Rolls and sashimi are always good!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my daughter's 7th birthday.  We purposely arrived around 3:30 pm.  We had the restaurant to ourselves.  We took advantage of the Happy Hour specials and family day Sunday (kids eat free with paying adult).  The food was excellent and fresh.  Our chef was fantastic.  My son said that this was the best lunch ever and is already asking to come back for his birthday.  Well worth the stop!  My son also got a kick out of the chef spraying \"lemon juice\" into his mouth from a baby bottle.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Service and Show/Food are complete opposites for ratings.  Show/Food was a 4 star Service would be a 1 star  Show/Food The chef was entertaining and engaging.  He made a good show and involved the diners.  He was funny and the food was spot on and delicious.  We tried 4 of the meats, including swordfish. It was all wonderful.   The service on the other hand was terrible, apparently they only use like 4 tables out of the 9 they have.  After being seated, some other people got seated at another table about 10 minutes later and got their soup before us.  We didn't even have our drinks at the time.  It just continued on with terrible attention from our waiter, the chef saved the day.  We were very close, like within 5 minutes of leaving due to a wait.  A couple at our table had been at the bar for 45 minutes before being seated and we had to wait another 20 minutes to get drinks."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful place to eat out with friends and family. The filet, scallops, and shrimp are always delicious. Chefs at teppanyaki tables have great personalities!"}
{"text":"First, I am unhappy with the service as they forgot my drink. Second, the sushi took a long long time to come out. I had the sushi with eel, tuna, white fish and sweet shrimp. The only thing that tasted fresh was the yellowtail. Do not get the sushi shrimp...it was gooey to the touch and tasted unthawed. With all the great reviews I had really hoped for more. Do not think I will be back :("}
{"text":"So good and so much fun! We took our three kids (16, 12 and 5) and we all LOVED it! The food is great - we did the Teppanyaki and really enjoyed the presentation, the atmosphere, everything. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mainly come here for the happy hour as they have a good variety of appetizers and rolls. I recommend the peppered ahi tuna! This place has a great atmosphere. A lot of people also dine in for teppanyaki which is also really good. Chefs keep it fun. Always a 5/5 experience here"}
{"text":"Do you have a bday or a group of friends to dine with? This place is so good! The atmosphere is really loud around the grills so its a little hard for everyone in the group to visit but the food is worth it! We ordered the dinner for 2 with Shrimp, Filet, Calamari, and sword fish.  The rice is the best I've had at a place like this! The shrimp have a nice taste, the filet was cooked perfectly every time we've been, and the calamari has a nice tasty sauce on top. The sword fish wasn't my favorite this time. We tried the chicken a different time and it was so juicy and tasty! The grill chefs are entertaining and the staff polite."}
{"text":"Normally we go to the superstition springs mall and have never had a bad experience or left unhappy. Tonight for the first time ever they just didn't have any available reservation so we decided to try out this location instead, well we had a reservation at 7:30 didn't get seated until almost 8 and then after about 15 minutes Tom comes out to the table(a previous awesome server from superstition) then someone came up and took him to another table after he began talking to us, then they noticed the table was broken. So finally after this someone didn't come out to the table until almost 845 to confirm and then start cooking our orders. We ended up leaving just because it would've been another hour before we would've got our food to eat it all. Just going to the other location tomorrow instead. If you ever wanna try Osaka I definitely recommend the superstition springs mall location, never have a bad experience/ and always leave happy and full!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday and it was our first time here. We got sushi as a starter, which was delicious! Then we got the dinner for 2 which included 4 meats, rice, veggies, and soup. The steak was my favorite but every other meat was also delicious. Our cook was fun and energetic and set the tone for the evening of celebration. They do a big show for birthdays which was entertaining. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved this place. From the moment we walked in, to the service, to the Teppanyaki cooking and entertainment, it was fabulous. Plus on Sundays, kiddos eat free with the purchase of an adult entree(s)! With prices being a bit steep, this makes it so worth it. We will be coming back as regulars from now on!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Osaka several times and every time has been a pleasure, except for this last trip. My Son and his Wife and I went there at my request because of my previous experiences that I had. This time was not the best. We arrived slightly before dinner rush. We ordered drinks and took a moment to figure our appetizers. No problem. We ordered and they were delivered in a reasonable amount of time. Appetizers were good. Then we waited a little longer than we thought reasonable. I admit it took a while for us to get our order together. When we did order the dinner crowd had arrived and was fairly busy. After we ordered we did see others getting their orders before we did even when they were seated way after we were. Once our was in it was over an hour before it was served. During our wait my son decided he wanted a beer and saki. He had to go to the bar and order. I can not complain about the food! It was great! This is the first time that the service was bad. Still recommend unless, I get another service like the last."}
{"text":"If you look at my past reviews, I can be very critical. But there is just nothing not to love about this place. The staff is great and the food is just awesome. The Hibachi cooks are a lot of fun. Extremely agile, talented and funny! I can't recommend Osaka enough. Tip: There's not much price difference to get the Filet Mignon over the regular steak but it is so much better!"}
{"text":"This place gets \"busy\". I highly recommend reservations for more than 3 people. The teppanyaki experience was good, chef was entertaining and courteous. The wait staff was attentive and polite. The food was fresh and delicious. Sushi was fresh and enormous, only order one at a time you will see what I mean. Would have gave 5 stars but not enough ventilation, it got really hot at our table. Overall you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I agree with previous poster. I would give this place a negative star too if I could! Service was horrible. Waited 40 minutes for my food and our server was only by once to get our drink order. The was only a maximum of 10 people in the whole place! When my sushi arrived I wasn't aware it was made topped with fish egg. Our sever was Michael, only asked to refill our drinks when we asked for the check. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"We stopped here after my daughter and her friend had just finished taking the SAT. If you want to take the word of a couple of 17 year-old honor students, testing is ruining their lives and they only just barely survived.   Looking in Yelp for something new on the way home, I found Osaka Japanese SteakHouse and was impressed by the reviews. Though we are all sushi fans, the girls opted for the hibachi side of the house. It was mid afternoon on a Saturday and there was only two or three other parties in the place with just a single person at a hibachi grill.   They sat us right away and throughout the service was excellent. After we gave our order the chef came out and started by squirting saki in my mouth. That alone gets this place extra stars! He had a non-saki equivalent for the girls (apple juice, I think) and one of them was brave enough to try. We had a good laugh then and also throughout as he prepped our food.  I had the steak, the girls had the chicken, and my wife had shrimp. We all tried each others and all of it was quite good. I think it is only the second time I've been to a hibachi place in my life, with the first being when I was 9 so I wasn't at all sure what to expect.   As much fun as we had at 2:30 on a Saturday, I imagine the place must be a real blast with a crowd on a weekend evening. We will have to come back to find out."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, we were seated immediately. Service was very polite, quick, and to the point. Our teppanyaki chef, EJ, was highly skilled and entertaining. The food was spectacular, and I would highly recommend the swordfish and salmon. The ingredients were very fresh. All in all, an exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy coming here.  The service is great and thru have fresh sushi and the edamame is simply the best!"}
{"text":"Top notch. Consistently the best sushi I've ever had.  Incredible value and the freshness is just perfection. Happy servers and fast - even when it's happy hour and packed.  Fed four hungry peeps for $50."}
{"text":"Fun place.  My husband and I LOVED their way to celebrate bdays- their bday song is very catchy and the birthday person gets to wear a silly Japanese head or dragon head  I was wishing it was my birthday so that I would get up and dance with that head on lol.  Great atmosphere, fun and funny service, food is good.  Not a 5 star to me because I felt that the food wasn't excellent like I have had at one of these places before, but it was still good.  The white sauce they give to dip the shrimp in was very good.  The shrimp by itself was a bit blah though.  Overall I would still return if ever in Arizona."}
{"text":"Went here for teppanyaki. It was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive. The cook and the show that is a part of the experience were great. We shared a dinner for two which gave us a lot of different foods to try. All were excellent. The bar was a lot of fun. A great way to do something fun with a group. We will be back."}
{"text":"Left a different place to come here. Food is good, place is clean and doesn't smell like that other place I left. Service was great, sat me down and order food was excellent. Great customer service, good food and the atmosphere here feels so much better than the last place I left. Thank you Osaka for being here"}
{"text":"Love this place. Went with friends to celebrate anniversary. Peter was awesome. Had great suggestion on saki. Very entertaining. Kept us all very entertaining through whole show. Everything was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Every time I go it's fun! If you go to the teppanyaki grill it's gonna be a wait but it's totally fun for the whole family. Good food and entertaining. It's pricey, so keep that in mind, but you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a sushi place that I haven't tried, but was sad after I tried Osaka last night. My standard sushi rolls were simply flavorless and the wasabi was not spicy. The place has a cozy layout and seems to be getting decent reviews, so I plan on giving it another chance."}
{"text":"Every time we go here it is EXCEPTIONAL! The Sushi is amazing! The teppanyaki show is great, better than most other places we have been to! Prices are great, especially during happy hour! This is our favorite place by far for date night or family dinners!"}
{"text":"Really great happy hour deals on sushi, they don't skimp and the service is usually pretty good. The citrus rolls are a favorite and the crab salad, also the beef rice."}
{"text":"The table experience is really good and fun but the sushi is not good. So my simple review is come to this place if you crave a normal meal.  If you want sushi - don't come here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and the place was packed. Wonderful ambiance. Food was absolutely delicious and the portions were huge. I'm from Vegas and they don't serve sushi that huge. Could easily share a roll. I was very impressed. I would've given this place a 5 star, but the service was a bit slow. Took a while for a server to come around and take our drink orders when we sat down and to grab the check when we were ready to pay. However, the food came out fairly quickly. I would definitely eat here again and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go to place - we always come here for amazing sushi.  It's always so fresh and delicious.  The staff is very professional and friendly.  Best rolls: Tequila, Las Vegas & Citrus and you MUST try the Crabmeat Jalape√±o Popper appetizer -- it's got an excellent happy hour."}
{"text":"OVER-RATED  Was not impressed at all.   Service was pretty good, although my wife did ask the waitress if there was MSG in their food.    The waitress said \"I don't know, and went no further to find out\".   Any table server would have found an answer.  OK, here's where the 1-star rating comes in.   THE FOOD.  It was virtually devoid of flavor. If anything the only flavor it did have was that of salt.   Too which my wife said hers just seemed to be way too salty. She ordered the mahi-mahi and I had the chicken teriyaki. It was not that the food was bad in anyway it was just blah blah blah (no flavor).   Portion sizes we're pretty good for the most part although we did not have any alcoholic drinks or the like and our bill was still $45.90 after tip. For that amount of money you really need to get a quality meal. In this case no quality. Add to that I took the leftovers home and had them for lunch at work the next day and all I can say is again blah blah blah.    Tip to the wise:.   There's an Oregano's within a stone's throw of this place and if you want better quality I'd recommend frequenting that place. See my review on that location as well. And no I don't work for Oregano's. I just get better food there."}
{"text":"Osaka Japanese Steakhouse, Mesa Arizona. What a poor excuse for a restaurant! A no star rating would be closer to the experience my wife & I had. We had a recommendation from an aquaintance and decided to try OJS for our 17th anniversary dinner. What an error in judgment. We arrived about ten minutes before our reservation and were promptly seated from there on it was downhill. Our server Ka#hy. greeted us and took our drink orders, ok so far, when she returned she took our appetizer order and asked if we knew what we wanted for our main course. We ordered and TOLD her that all our dishes should NOT come as one meal. Our first clue to the poor service was that our salad and soup came before the appetizer, then about five minutes later our appetizrers gyoza & yakituba, jalapenos & tender pork  (not) shoe leather is a better discription arrived over cooked, gyoza undercooked and not crisp. Once again, too fast, our main course was served. At this point I told Ka#hy, I was very upset that the meal had come, she offered to take it back to the kitchen and HOLD it for us. WTF hold it, you must be kidding! We ordered lobster! Ka#hy came by twice more once to ask if the food was good. When I replied\" just ok\" she showed no interest or concern (thanks for the customer service). I feel that  this all is partially my fault, two seven ounce lobster tails at a restaurant only $33.00( buyer beware), I should have sent everything back to begin with (my error).  As we were leaving I asked to see the manager,  I was told he was out on an errand, ( Saturday night at 7:00pm?). So I asked to talk to the person running the restaurant(surprise) they were on a business call and could NOT see me. Again WTF! I left my name & # received a call the next day from Tony? the GM, he asked about our experience. I told him the same thing I have written here and said I would NEVER go back, he offered me a gift card AFTER I told him\"I WILL NEVER GO BACK\" to the restaurant. I reiterated my concerns and once again he offered a gift card( are you listening?). Oh well. Maybe the restaurants reputation lays with the Teppan Kitchen? I can't say, we had table service because it was our anniversary. :(     Jeremy M. Goldman"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice! Drinks are good..I had jalape√±o deep fried with cream cheese. It was fantastic! I would get that alone next time with a soup but the roll called firework wasn't that good. I ate 2 pieces left the rest. I would go back sooner if the waiter who explained they are very new should've taken the roll I ordered off the bill. It was okay overall. Not too memorable"}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner with the family. Our waiter is awfully nice but there does not seem to be enough wait staff to even give an average dining experience. Plenty of management standing around though. We had to ask the hostess / management for chopsticks, on another occasion for napkins and yet a third time for a menu. I am still here and bet I'll have to hit her up again. Food is average, dinning experience below average. Truly dissapointed."}
{"text":"Entertaining and delicious!! There's no better combo than that!!!! If you come in - come for the teppanyaki! You won't regret! The more the merrier!"}
{"text":"I didn't have much expectations for this place but the happy hour menu was awesome! The rolls were much bigger than I thought it would be considering we ordered from the HH menu and it was not all rice! The fish tasted fresh. 2 Kirin beers for $4? Hell yeah!  Took one star off for the slow like a turtle service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome family fun. Our Server was very fun and the whole place has a tremendously festive atmosphere. The food was excellent quality and cooked to our specifications. The Happy Birthday song is great and the masks Birthday guests get to wear are phenomenal. This is the best Teppanyaki place we have ever been too!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.    We needed a place to watch the Niners-Cards game and by the Harkins theater where we took the kid to see \"iInto The Woods\"   Summer, our sushi chef created a great meal!  Definitely worth a second try."}
{"text":"Good service. Sushi is awsome. Parking lot is nice. I don't have to wait for a long time to take a seat."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews about this place, I decided to take the family here for my wife's bday and teppanyaki.   We LOVED IT!  Our waiter was very friendly. He tolerated all of our antics and played along with anything and everything we dished out to him. Needless to say, I have a very friendly and outgoing family.  Back, to the review. The ambiance and the staff were great. The food was also delicious. A little salty, but still tasty.  The teppanyaki chef was awesome; he scared my son with all his screaming, but that's a personal issue my 4 year old has lol! My family and I had a lot of fun. We were able to be as loud and as silly as we wanted to be!  It was my wife's bday and they sang for her using Japanese masks. My wife was \"twerking\" with one of the staff members!  It was hilarious!   All in all, great place, great food and great experience!  We will definitely coming back to this place!"}

{"text":"Been here maybe 15 times in three years.  The food and service is usually great.  Last visit which was last night, not so much.  I took my family of four there to celebrate my birthday and my sons birthday.  We usually get a $25 coupon in the mail for our birthday dinner, but didnt this year but went anyway. We were seated with another family who were also celebrating birthdays which is normal in a hibachi restaurant.  They were on soup and salads when we sat, so the waiter promptly brought our soup and salads, and one bite in to our soup and salad the chef shows up and starts cooking.  So, we had to rush our pre-meal to eat our meal which I hate.  Dinner was good and chef was great.  I got the bill and told the waiter I never recieved my coupon for my birthday and he said they were having problems with automated email system for coupons.  I told him I would give him my license showing it was my birthday and he said OK I will ask Tony, who I am guessing is the owner or manager.  He came back and said, no coupon, we cant honor it without the email which I found funny.  You are willing to lose a repeat customer who came to your establishment on his birthday over a $25 coupon, because your system is having trouble. Bad business practice."}
{"text":"Better than benihanas for sure. This place has a live ambiance and they constantly squirt sake into your mouth like its some food porn movie. Our server was very attentive and great. All in all, this place is legit and for what you get for the money, I would definitely come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Father's Day, so a special occasion. Made a reservation 3-4 weeks prior. I tried to check in with the hostess when we arrived on time, and very rudely was told I needed to wait in the check-in line. Understandable. Not the way she phrased it but okay. We're finally able to check in and she could not find my name on her list, have to show my confirmation email with the reservation she then tells me that even with a reservation there is a twenty minute delay. I don't think they were expecting the amount of guests they have and the staff was clearly frazzled and stressed. Very unprofessional and unapologetic. Not a great experience at all, planned the day in advance for a reason, left another gathering early to get here on time. Have still after 20 mins not been seated, the food has never been disappointing only reason to stay.  Update*** after 47 minutes finally seated, one in our party wanted something not on the teppanyaki and server was arguing with them telling them where to order. After frustratingly taking the order she wanted, when someone else from the kitchen brought it out, spilled the sauce on that guest plus another. Barely even got a sorry. What is usually a great experience, complete opposite this visit."}
{"text":"We love Teppanyaki style restaurants and decided to give this place a try for our friends promotion celebration. We went on a Sunday night without making reservations so we were not surprised when we were told there was an hour long wait. We said ok and headed over to place near by for some drinks as we waited. When it was about an hour we headed back where they told us it would be 10 more mins longer than what they told us. So we waited and another 30 mins passed by, no apology's or anything.   Well they finally call our name and seated us. A couple minutes later they seated the table across from us. Was I surprised when they served and fed the people across from us before us even though we were seated first? No because so far I hadn't been impressed. Our cook comes over about another 15 mins after that. He was great and we enjoyed his cooking. So there were no problems there.  Overall the experience was ok compared to other teppanyaki places we have been and most likely won't go back unless I don't want to really make a drive to another."}
{"text":"Walked in first impression quiet and lacked atmosphere. Not good at all! Tiny rolls that are loosely wrapped and come apart when you pick them up. The Crunchy Roll is a piece of shrimp wrapped in the middle of a California roll. Nothing fancy nothing special. The tempura was not cooked a the way my broccoli piece still had flour that was visible in it. Will not return here and $30 was way too much to spend."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located and has two seating options- Teppanyaki tables (order two entree from the teppanyaki menu) and non Teppanyaki tables. I opted for the later and tried the Fried Calamari (hot and crispy) and sushi/sashimi platter. From the platter, I loved the nigiri california avocado roll and from the sashimi, the Tuna and Salmon was good. However, I totally did not dig the Yellow Tail fish. Ehh!! The shrimp and crab sushi was tasty. An yelp check in gave me a free Tempura fried icecream. Yay!  Also the server, Corey was very good and check on us often to see if we were doing Okay.  Overall, a good experience. I will recommend the Teppanyaki if you visit in a group."}
{"text":"The wait time usually isn't too bad, about 15 minutes. We usually need to wait until enough people arrive which want the meal prepared in front of them. The chefs are always entertaining during their prep of the meal. The food itself is ehh ok, nothing outstanding at least everything I have tried from the performance meal (most of it). Their sushi is really good, a very nice size and fresh.  We mainly go just for the entertainment value.  If you want to be entertained its a winner, if you want to go simply for a meal its average."}
{"text":"A former colleague of mine at the last engineering company and I worked at took me here to enjoy sushi.  It was really delicious and wonderful.  Not a lot of people there when we went, which was probably about a month ago.  Our waitress, which I now can't remember her name, but she's Chinese, 23 yrs old from China, with pretty decent English, was really awesome.    It was a lot of food, but we came here for lunch.  The ambiance was nice for us to catch up in, though, dark.  Hopefully sometime in the future, I can bring my husband and kids here so we can do Teppanyaki, as my husband doesn't like sushi, nor more daughter.   But, my son loves sushi.    Great place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited for a fun lunch at Osaka to try a new place, and they have very reasonably priced lunches. However, we showed up a few minutes before they opened and we waiting until after 11 and then went in. After standing there a few minutes with the sushi chef looking up a few times it never saying anything we still had not been greeted. Then, the hostess walked in late for work, didn't say anything and walked past us to get her name badge and answer the phone that had been ringing. She took a few phone calls with us still just standing there and then said \"can I help you with something?\" As if they were not open. We explained we were there for food and then eventually were seated.  All while this was going on a manager or other employee walked in and sat down at a front desk never saying a word to us. Very poor service before we even sat down. Once being seated we sat there a while and we had a nice server and another couple that came in was sat next to us, and she commented on how it was interesting that they had to sit literally right next to us. There was prob one else, they could have sat at least one seat away. Then while we waited for the chef I noticed someone behind the curtain of the kitchen was cutting their nails!!! So gross! The food and experience with the chef was good, nothing spectacular though."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and already receive good service but this time it was different. It got me really mad they gave us this server who was clearly on something. Either high or drunk but he was slurring his words forgot our order multiple times. But we thought maybe he was new so we weren't so upset. Until he started walking behind my son who is 1 and a half and my little brother who is 5. He was just standing and out of nowhere he fell almost on top of them. Like a drunk person falling, he stayed sitting on the floor like he was going to puke. My dad had to help him up. We told the manager and all he said was the floor must of been wet. I said nothing spilled and then went on to saying the waiter has a bad knee. He didn't replace the waiter until my husband got up and spoke with one of the girls up front. This has never ever happened to me before even the people sitting next to us looked mad at the waiter for the way he was acting. Then the waiter goes and try's to pick up my brother. I'm sorry but that's not Normal behavior and what got mad is that everyone was just covering up for him. They didn't even let him go home they kept him just wondering around. We were definitely not safe around that guy."}
{"text":"We went on a double date to Osaka. It was a blast. Our chef put on a great show and we got at least three shots of sake, bottle fed to us during cooking time. My girlfriend and I paid the $7 split plate fee and shared a filet/chicken combo. It was more than enough food. And super tasty. Bae got the lobster which he enjoyed. Each meal came with two shrimp as well.   The restaurant was on the noisy side, but half of the noise was the chefs cooking. And it seemed like every 15 min the \"Happy Birthday\" song came on and the restaurant burst into a loud celebration. By the end of the night we had it memorized and were trying to decide how many nights of working there would it take before the song drive you completely insane."}
{"text":"This place won't last much longer. The service is so terrible it doesn't make any sense to eat here. Last night was the final straw in a series of bad experiences. The waiter forgot my 2 year olds food (she was screaming EAT!!!!! for 15mins in an empty restaurant) I ended up spending $15 on more food to compensate for the waiters mistake so she had something to eat while he had her original food made:. The fish we ordered was still frozen and our order was totally wrong. I observed people sitting at the Sushi bar for 30mins (at least) and not one person stopped to help them until they asked. When I asked for the manager he gave me literally every excuse possible and had the audacity to offer 15% off my bill. That didn't even cover the kids meal my daughter didn't eat. We been coming here at least once a month for a year because the foo but never again."}
{"text":"Amazing experience I really like the atmosphere! The food was amazing and the fried rice is the best. The chef at the table was hilarious and my family and I really had a great time. I haven't been to a restaurant like this since I've lived in LA. 10/10"}
{"text":"Stephanie is the sweetest server ever! She is so kind and keeps me coming back to this place. I love the filet and the fried rice here. The sushi is great and fresh. Their purple rice is interesting but I found out that it's healthier so I'm all about it now."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my favorite sushi bar and they have an awesome happy hour with their scorpion bowl that is to die for! The food is always fresh and made to order which is definitely appreciated"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant overall. Amazing staff, highly entertaining, delicious food, great service & good times. Enormous menu variety for both food and drink. I recommend going in a group, the more people = more fun! Weather it's with family, girls night, or a group of friends! It's always a blast! *Making reservations is highly suggested*"}
{"text":"Great sushi during my visit and service was very good. Did not try the steak and sat in the bar area. They have group tables if you want a steak experience and watch them grill it in front of you. I will try it again as my experience was good. They are new so may be just working the kinks out based on reading other reviews."}
{"text":"Server David was awesome. We sat at the sushi bar and both chefs were beyond great! My #1 sushi by far and we drove from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Based on previous reviews, I had high expectations for Osaka. This was our first visit tonight and possibly our last. I am not a Teppanyaki connoisseur or anything but this dinner was nothing like I expected. I will say that it is VERY family friendly (it felt like kid night or something) but when you're out for date night, that's not really want you want.   Anyway, we had made reservations, since we didn't know how busy they get, and were seated right away. They weren't busy at the time so not sure if reservations were really needed. Our server was pretty prompt in taking our drink order, but that's the only good thing that he did. Remember, they were not busy but it took 20min to get a drink that I ordered and only got it after I asked about it. Our chef was good. You could tell he was trying to be engaging but the people who were sat with us acted like they didn't really care. I got filet and chicken and my husband got shrimp and chicken. Both of our meals were good but could have been seasoned a little more. I asked for steamed rice instead of fried rice and wasn't informed at the time of ordering (and didn't see on the menu) that I'd be charged extra for it. We were only told that after we had to hunt down another server to ask for the rice since everyone else was halfway done eating and we couldn't find our server and I was never given the rice for my meal. When he finally came over, I told him I had to ask someone else for the rice and when we got our bill, he said that they \"took it off\" (the rice) since it wasn't brought out promptly. I've NEVER heard of a place charging if you sub rice so I don't know if he was just trying to make it sound like he did us a favor or if they really do charge for that.   The two stars is mainly based on service. The food was okay, but I still probably wouldn't say that I'd be back based on food alone. Maybe if our table mates had been a bit more engaging, it would have been better as well. We will have to continue our search for a great hibachi/teppanyaki place!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Mesa several times and we found the food delicious and service more than adequate. Unfortunately, we did not get to even try the food at the new location.   We had 5:30 PM reservations and when we showed up it was packed. They told us it would be a half hour wait, which considering it's a new location and being an unusually busy because of Mother's Day, 30 minutes didn't seem that bad. Well, after a half hour more people being seated and when we checked how we were placed, they said there was 7 more parties ahead. My Thee year old was not going to make it, so we chose to leave.  I hate giving one star for something like this, but there was really no excuse for the absolute unpreparedness and attitude of the front staff, especially this being a second location in town. I will eventually try the food and follow up, but for now, I'll just go to the Mesa location."}
{"text":"It's always a great time at Osaka! Just make sure you're okay with loud drum sounds and people singing happy birthday...  My family and I have been here a few times now and so far we have found the food to be consistent. Teppanyaki is such a fun time. The show is exciting and they squirt sake shots at you. I guess it's typical but our chef really did a great job. He cooked our meat to the correct temperature while entertaining us. I mean, talk about multitasking.   If you only wanted sushi, they do have minimal seating areas for that near the bar. Make sure to try the yellowtail carpaccio and the fat boy roll. You can't go wrong with those!  Service have been and hit and miss but nothing we wouldn't come back for. Minor issues like water refill etc.   Overall, if you're looking to have fun and be in a loud atmosphere then definitely try this place."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place! Today I went and ordered Filet mignon and got steak. I ask them to charge me for what I got, manager came over to my table asking what happened I explained that I got steak, he didnt believe me,  then he grabbed my plate, took it to the kitchen to find out, if it was filet mignon, well he came back with the plate and said only a few pieces where steak the rest was filet mignon!! Then he said I will gave you a discount, I wasn't looking for free food or a discount, I only wanted to pay for what they decided to give me, then he said to eat my food?? I said no I'm not eating that, then he said I will put it in a box, I said no I will never eat that, why would you take my plate?? He got mad and threw the plate in the sink or floor I'm sure he just made a big noise, everybody at my table notice how rude he was, then he say sorry I was really upset at the chef, even if you are upset at the chef you don't do that at a restaurant. I understand that we all make mistakes, nobody is perfect, but instead of  fixing the problem he made everything worse!!  I will not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. Great atmosphere. Wanted to try their sushi but was once again sucked into the overwhelmingly fun promise of teppanyaki. Filet mignon and lobster set my carnal urges to rest. Thx Osaka"}
{"text":"delicious food here, at unbeatable prices! normally I'll only go to a sushi joint for happy hour, but the prices are still very reasonable during normal hours :)  making my boyfriend take me here for all our sushi dates!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed their happy hour specials so much, we went back three times while on our vacation!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Osaka for lunch often and was pleased when I discovered they're open for lunch again.  Their website is outdated and shows a different menu or at least different options.  They used to offer a steak Bento box and their website showed it was available but when I dined there for lunch today it was only available as a dinner.  OK, I moved on and also realized they offer a Miso soup or salad when they used to serve both with their Bento box.  No biggie I opted for the salad and it arrived promptly and was chilled, fresh and tasty.  When my Teriyaki Chicken Bento box arrived it looked very appetizing and the Tempura was fresh, hot and very good.  The sushi was made with purple rice and was four pieces of a roll.  It was made with imitation crab leg and some veg.  I'm not a fan of the 'ole \"sea leg\" particularly when at a sushi bar.  However this was not the biggest disappointment, the Teriyaki chicken was dry, tough and apparently leftover from who knows when?  I seldom complain to servers but felt compelled when I asked for the check  and was offered a take-out box for the chicken and replied \"no thanks\" and proceeded to explain the issues I had with the chicken.  She was professional, apologized and advised the kitchen on my behalf.  She was a very good server and probably would have offered me something else had I complained before it was obvious I was leaving.  I asked if there were new owners and was told indeed there was a new owner.  I hope he/she can get the kitchen staff up to par because leftover stale food is not what I expect."}
{"text":"I love this place. So fun & different from your everyday restaurant. We save Osaka for special occasions. It is a bit pricey!"}
{"text":"Terrible services today , the waiter didnt take cares our table well likes ask for just empty dish and we didnt get it or i ask some question and he just grab my phone and walk around to ask his co worker not even ask my permission to bring my personal thing away from me like this."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see this restaurant opening in Gilbert. Today I finally had a chance to stop by and was very disappointed. I came solo during lunch on Sunday ready to enjoy teppanyaki. Unfortunately that didn't happen due to a lack of enoufh people to be seated ay the grill. I was informed that a new table could not be started immediately - which is normal in my opinion - but that I would need to wait until more customers arrived or be seated at the bar. I came for the experience at the grill so the bar was not an option for me. I was not in a major rush so I decided to give 15 min wait period for others you come dine. Finally another person came in but she too was not seated due to her party not being present in full. I waited another 5 minuted and then decided I would go elsewhere. I'm not sure if I'd return as most visits I'd be solo and don't want to deal with the same. There are other teppanyaki options in the area that I've never experienced this issue. My suggestion is to provide a wait time for the grill but not single out your willingness to seat solo customers due to a lack of business."}
{"text":"We visited Osaka in Gilbert on Sunday 7/9/17. We called and made a reservation for 5 people at 6pm earlier that day. Upon arriving to the restaurant, they sat us in 4 seats and rather than take a chair away and replace it with a high chair they just added her to the corner of the already crammed teppanyaki table. We specifically made a reservation for 5 seats. I did this on purpose because I've been in this situation before and we need the room. I was frustrated. I went and spoke with the hostess who had already sat a party of four next to us. She said we could give up our seats and wait 45-1 hour for another table. That would not work, we have a little who needs to eat. If anyone has ever sat at the corner of a table you know how difficult it is to eat, let alone a toddler who is still new at using utensils with her meal. Other than that, the portions were good. The food was good and my steak medium rare as requested. My parents were charged for splitting a portion which would have been understandable if they were just eating teppanyaki, but they also had a few sushi rolls. If we go back I will definitely be more clear about our seating preferences. But that's a big if."}
{"text":"Food was good. We sat on the dining table side. We had the calamari app and the tuna app. The tuna could have had a little more spice. Calamari was hit and miss. Some were good, some were mushy and some rubbery. The happy hour menu looks good. I'll have to come back and try that. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I'm going back for dinner. I'll update my review after that."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place and we have been going here for years. They have great sushi and very good Teppan. However, I have to review them based upon our experience there on Christmas Day. I made an online reservation for a party of 5 for when they opened at 4:00 p.m.  We arrived 15 minutes early and there was a huge mob waiting outside the door. We got in line and finally made it to the hostess at 4:20. I showed them our reservation and 2 of the employees seemed thrown off as they struggled to find us a table. They sat the 5 of us at a smallish table for 4 and brought us a 5th chair. We understand that Christmas Day was a very busy time but it took  about 45 minutes before we saw a waitress, even after we inquired with the hostess and were assured someone would be with us shortly. We would have left, but we knew we wouldn't find someplace else to serve us any sooner and we had our 91 year old mother with us. It wouldn't have been good for her to make a change.  Of course the food was fantastic as always, which is why I give them 3 stars, when normally I would Give them 5. However, we learned that they took walk-ins ahead of those with reservations. That was a major fail, especially since we were not late, only stuck in a long line. Please Osaka, take those with proven reservations ahead of the walk-ins. We will be back for the great food but, never again on a holiday."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! My fianc√© and I eat here frequently because it is the best in the area by far. Sushi chefs are great, very friendly. Everything is very fresh. Even tried fresh wasabi for the first time, what a difference! We'll definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"It was a choice between this one and the other sushi place that was next to a nail salon and we probably would've been better off at the other place. Had the Mama Mia and Sunshine rolls along with the basic California and Alaska roll as well as an order of fried rice with steak. As soon as the rolls were brought out our server felt the need to explain why the rice looked purple. It was because they used black rice which he went on to explain would be healthier. The picture didn't look like that nor was there anything in the menu that  said they used black rice...did they run out of sushi rice? Did I miss the fine print? But we were open to trying it. Well, it was a big disappointment. They couldn't even get the fried rice right although it was made with the normal white rice. Should've known when the server started to explain what he brought out as well as lack of diners. Would've been nice to let us know before ordering all the rolls for 2 people ( the 3rd party was having the fried rice plate). Also would've been nice for him to try and accommodate after seeing the obvious disappointment. The only decent thing was the tofu appetizer."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have a loud Birthday Party withDrums and Symbols! Food is yummy too. We enjoyed sushi at the Bar.  We'll definitely bring our Birthday Party back. Tonight was just a quick dinner.they offered a deep fried tempura ice cream, interesting but I wouldn't order it again. Hold the Tempura and I'll take my Green Tea Ice cream plain. Vegas Roll and Mango roll was smothered in sauce and could've been better with light sauce. The magic roll was served with skewers and didn't help to eat it without falling apart."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes. Good food, clean place, and not over priced! This will be the go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"We really wanted some hibachi. I Yelp! up places around me and went here, mainly because I like saying OSAKA.  This place lived up to my liking!  Gary, our chef, did an amazing job. Entertaining and cooked our food perfect.  I went with Swordfish and it was so good. Plenty good portions of rice and veggies. Soup and salad before was good.   Will definitely return, especially on my birthday. They have great happy birthday celebration. (Saw it at another table)"}
{"text":"Pretty good, service was good, food could have been a bit warmer, didn't get to try the hot tables, we will return :)"}
{"text":"This was my first Teppanyaki experience! I have to say it was quite entertaining! Our chef was very energetic, nice and a lot of fun. I really wasn't sure what to expect so it was fun randomly getting food thrown in my mouth, sake shot at me and watching my food be prepared right in front of me. I wasn't completely impressed with the taste of the shrimp or chicken, but the rice and the steak had great flavor to it. If you want to mix it up a bit, they give you a few different sauces you can try with your meal too. The staff was very nice, professional and accommodating. We had arrived late and didn't have a reservation, but they were able to sneak us into a table with another family. It was fun meeting a random family and having a meal together!  Over all - A-OK place. Im interested in trying it again!"}
{"text":"First time eating there tonight. We all enjoyed our meals and the service was great! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. We were there for 20 minutes without service, menus or a greeting. I had to ask for a menu, had to ask for everything! It ruined my husband's and I 10th anniversary. Being that we have so many children we only get to dine out once a year if our budget allows. The food was presented well however the sushi was still half frozen. We were ignored the whole time. Never going back. And you shouldn't either. Just a fair warning to my beloved Yelp community."}
{"text":"Been coming here a lot and there is a reason. I love the sushi, especially the peppered Ahi. It's a friendly place and I love taking my out of town friends.  Great Happy Hour too."}
{"text":"I went there for a birthday celebration with 12 people. My friend ordered a filet mignon and received a steak instead. The manager was not very friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, the largest I have ever had.  Our server David was on point an anticipated our every need.  We never had to ask for refills and he was very attentive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner.  He is a huge fan of Benihana and I have never had any sort of teppenyaki before so we decided to give it a try.  On a Tuesday at 5pm, we were both surprised that there was only one other patron in the restaurant.  The staff was incredibly attentive - our glasses were rarely even close to empty and they checked on us fairly regularly.  We also received complementary edamame as an appetizer and coffee cake as a dessert.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Our main meal was of decent quality - if the portions had not been large, it would not have been worth the cost (which is similar to Benihana).  I did, however, take home enough food for lunch tomorrow which made it worth it in my opinion.  We did not order any alcoholic beverages but a quick glance at the menu showed a decent selection of beer and wine, all for a very fair price, especially if you go during happy hour.   Overall, I wish I could give 3.5 stars but given that the staff went above and beyond, I will round up instead of down.  I would certainly consider going back - again, the cost v. quality is the only reason I would overlook Osaka."}
{"text":"This place f*cking sucks. The service is shit, the food is shit, I couldn't wait to leave. Thanks for ruining our Friday night."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Osaka about 3 times a year and the \"show\" they put on is usually identical from one visit to the next. The food is normally just ok. Tonight we must have had a new guy because the \"show\" lacked most of the elements that it normally had and he was not as proficient with his tools, however, he was the best chef we have ever had there. Every bit of the food was the best I've ever had there. I can only assume that all the other cooks where focusing to much on the show and not on the food.  I was very happy because I don't really care about the show. I only go there because my wife likes it. Tonight the food was the best I've ever had there. I had the lobster and the filet Mignon. It was very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! On Tuesdays if you order a drink you get these killer sushi specials!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Best sushi restaraunt in the area. The atmosphere is upbeat and romantic. Great place for drinks with friends or a Friday night date. Also, the sushi chefs are some of the most personable people around. Always get to enjoy a great conversation with them!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Dynamite roll. I call it in and it's ready when I go pick it up. It's quite filling too!"}
{"text":"Mmm we meet again sushi.... Love me some salmon sashimi! Here and that day's sushi was fresh and buttery! It came with a beautiful orchid. I love when a restaurant can turn dishes into a piece of art as you will see in the included photo. I also ordered the Lisa Lisa roll...some yellowtail, salmon, and tuna rolled up in crunchiness. This is a great roll to order if you want a bit of spicy, a lil crunch, and a raw variety of fish. What I also liked about this roll was the amount of rice it was rolled into. Not a crap load of rice! Excellent! More for me to order and eat!   We sat at the teppanyaki side. This is entertaining if you've never tried it before. It's a mini cooking performance for your Japanese steak and shrimp or the like. You will be seated with other strangers. But hey! The more the merrier! One thing to mention, you and your hair will smell like your dinner by the end of your meal. So don't dress in prom attire.   The chef lights your plate on fire and might give you a lil squirt of sake. The fried rice is fired up first, then the shrimp and lobster, then the steak, and lastly the veggies. So depending on how hungry you are, you might be devouring it in that order with just the veggies as leftovers. I liked the steak made medium or medium rare. It was served true to the order...pink in the middle."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a -0. Their is no hospitality or welcoming feeling as you step in through the doors it's as if you somehow ended up at a hospital for a split second! It's the first review I have to say that I was not impressed at all from being greeted from the 2 hostess standing around pretending to be busy and not even once cracking a real smile!  Well, onto our seats we were seated towards the back of the restaurant closest to the sushi bar. Nice ambiance with the decor I was happy to be here because I saw some of there photos with what I thought \"Yes, real Japanese food!\" I'm super hungry for some steak, baked mussels, and calamari! Boy, were we in for a rude awakening... Our waitress did not come to give us water, say hello for a good 10minutes. Within 10 minutes I knew exactly what we wanted before she came. When she did finally arrive to our table there was no introducing of her name \"hi my name is ____ I'll be your waitress tonight would you like some water?!\" Lol... Nope non of that tonight... It was \"you ready foa yoa order what you like?\" Lol and I of course had to stop her, look at her name tag and say \"well, hello Cate how are you tonight? We're very excited you stopped by FINALLY & she totally dismissed my introduction of \"hey breathe n greet us better!\"  We normally would put our appetizers in first, then our salads, and last our main entree. But, because I knew the service was already slow I told my husband put in all the order that way it won't take as long! Sure enough even with placing everything in we still waited almost an hour to receive our food!  Their calamari is a sad looking joke! I know $4.00 what was we thinking totally not worth getting, then the baked mussels it looked like it was overcooked, shriveled, and no mayo sauce on it! On top of that our water service was pretty bad we had to literally wave her down to have her full our glasses of water every time and one time we asked for both glasses to be filled she only took one! SMH... Lol! The water also was not great I could taste the chlorine in it... Blllaahhh! I just asked for a glass of wine just to be safer! The only thing we liked was the teriyaki box with steak....  This was a one time only visit and never again!!!"}
{"text":"Attention please...if you want sushi and like options this is the place! They also have a full bar along with tapanyaki options. We came here hoping for good sushi, quick, and not to expensive and we were not disappointed! The place should've been packed but I'm glad it wasn't today. We ordered a happy hour spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, edamame, and miso soup. The miso soup was good and the seaweed was fresh. Can't go wrong with edamame. Now the shrimp tempura was rolled larger than we liked and cut thin which makes it difficult to pick up without it falling apart. Luckily we're pros and it didn't break, roll was very good I love how the tempura wasn't overbearing or oily. My spicy tuna was great, nice kick and very fresh. I'm definitely going back and next time I'm taking part in some of the other awesome menu options. Ramen, tapanyaki grill, cheap beer and saki bombs...for sure   Forgot to mention they have a nice purple rice very fluffy and sticky perfect for sushi!"}
{"text":"Absolutly unbelievable!!! Our first time visiting this restaurant and we were seated by a family extremely close to us. The father of the family was extremely drunk and kept dropping F bombs. We kindly asked them to stop bc we had a 5 year old and it was rude. The gentleman told me to go F myself and sit down bc I was ruining his buzz. The manager came over and basically brushed us off and only tended to his \"regular\" customer. The man continued to call us other derogatory names. And call my wife a B****. We were not offered another table or anything. So sad...we were excited to try a new restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I go here every once in a while because of the good food. But today was by far the worst experience we've had. We went in at around 445 and was greeted up front and was seated right away, there were only about 5 people total in there sitting at the bar. 5 mins have gone by and we still werent approached by anyone for anything like drinks atleast. 20mins went by and waiters have been walking past and even making eye contact with me but seem to be avoiding us... After making that eye contact and still didnt get service we decided to leave. And as we were walking out we were greeted out by the front hostess to have a good night... go figure l  2 stars just cause of the good sushi rolls"}
{"text":"Great as usual! The service and staff are excellent, and the sushi is the best around. Ive been here 4 times, and haven't found a place yet that I enjoy more."}
{"text":"We love Osaka. My grandson calls it fire!we get the steak and lobster and it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Went to Osaka for my birthday dinner last night. Got the Filet and Scallop tepinyaki  it was delicious!!! Perfectly cooked and a nice sized portion. I have an entire meal leftover.  Loved it and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with the service we received for my kid's birthday dinner. Starting with the hostess who got upset with us for moving over 1 chair so that we didn't have to sit in the corner of the table with zero room and no table space to eat. The teppanyaki chef was so inappropriate and vulgar while snacking the steaks saying \"you like it rough' yeah smack that\". As a birthday tradition we always go to this restaurant. The kids love when the chef interacts with them. This guy didn't even talk to the kids. He didn't squirt the apple juice from the baby bottle, he didn't do the onion volcano/train and didn't have them catch food in their mouth. He rushed through being very inappropriate. The kids were so upset that their birthday dinner wasn't fun like it always has been. I tried to reach out to the restaurant and have received no response. Just another reason to not go back. If I am paying $100 for dinner it better be worth it and it absolutely wasn't."}
{"text":"Thanks for ruining my granddaughter birthday today! This is her favorite place and we made reservations  at 6:30 pm tonite. And you proceeded to mess them up and we couldn't eat until 9 pm!! Really 9 pm! I would give you ZERO stars if it allowed it. We will be going somewhere else tonite and other nights!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi and teppanyaki place in town. Good food, service and show if you are seated at the teppanyaki section. It's almost the only place where I can find sea urchin"}
{"text":"Very fresh Sushi, best I've had in AZ. I went here for the first time the other night and I was very impressed.  My whole part thought the food was excellent (Hibachi and Sushi).  I am from the east coast as is my family and this place def lives up to back home.  I've found my new sushi spot.  My brother got the scallops and they came out with this huge scallops.  The tuna was so fresh it melted in my mouth.   The place is large and has nice decor for a date night. Portions are large and worth the money."}
{"text":"Great happy hour sushi and drink specials. Great service! Loved the rainbow roll, crunchy roll and spicy shrimp!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Came here for our daughters birthdays and they tried charging extra for gratuity for my five children. My husband left 10 for a tip and gave our guy an additional 10 dollars absurd! Followed us out to the car and called cops with 125 we paid ended up getting our tip back after police corrected them they put 8 or more on their menu gratuity has to be paid our family is of seven and they added a person just absurd"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday and had a blast! Their fried rice is the best from the teppanyaki. Reserving was easy, just give them a call. They have great service too, whether the place is packed or nearly empty. I haven't drank all their beverages, but the saki is my favorite. I really like their calamari too. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I sooooooo want to give this place 5 stars because their food is so good and the people that work there are genuinely super nice... But they are always short staffed, AND tell the customers about all the call offs. I work in an ER and we NEVER tell patients when we are short staffed. That's not their problem. You just give them the best service you can with an extra big smile. We left Friday night after waiting 1.5 hours for a table of 4 while there were a ton of open seats. We left after they said they could seat us, but not for another 15 minutes because there was no waitress for the table. Too much info. Fire the ass hats that keep calling in, and keep making great food. I believe in you."}
{"text":"Mediocre. That sums about everything up. Service was Ok. Ambiance was poor. Food was bland. Sushi was pretty meh. I sat in the non-teppanyaki side but frankly I don't see how that would change the food. It shouldn't matter who cooks it. The reviews for this place are suspiciously high so may want to take that into consideration before you come here."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions! Make sure to make a reservation if attending Fri-Sun.  Good place to take friends and family on their birthday as well..."}
{"text":"Bring a crowd with you,  This Place is great fun!  Went here for my birthday 2013. I'll gladly go here again for the next big occasion. Our chef was ***** great, and funny too. He made the whole group laugh and he was good at tossing and chopping the food.  The food was *** nothing specatular but good.  The whole experience was A+ if you want a memorable time for your bday or anniversary or whatever occasion it may be.   I didn't go to the sushi side, but that may be a place to go sometime for happy hour..."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time last month. We had a party of six and we all had the Teppanyaki. Between all the members of our party we tried the chicken, filet mignon, the regular steak, shrimp and scallops. The presentation and food was good. They brought out complimentary desert and had my daughter wear a Japanese mask while they sang.  I made a reservation the day before for 8pm on a Sat. It was my daughter's birthday so it was a special night for us. When we arrived they told us they didn't have our table ready, we ended up not getting seated until 8:40pm. I made the reservation online, so that was a little frustrating. We will give them another try in the future when it's not so busy. (We went last time on a Sat night and there was about a one hour wait!).   ** There are multiple restaurants and hotels in this little stretch and parking is very limited on a Sat night."}
{"text":"I chose well with the SASHIMI SALAD. Generously portioned and dressing served on the side by default. Delicious!  The servers seemed to be running around a lot, but it was a Saturday night at 7:00 PM so can't knock them for that. Little noisy, so go there expecting a good time and party atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have attempted to eat here twice now, and I won't be returning.   The first time I tried Osaka, myself and 3 others decided to check it out on a Saturday night. We decided to sit at the cooking table. Our server was nice and helpful, though, seemed puzzled when we asked questions regarding the sushi. I ordered the yellowtail sashimi and it had a huge bloodline in it, not tasty! My friends were not very satisfied by the quality of their sushi, though, I cannot recall which rolls they tried. The prepared food was much better than the sushi, but was very buttery.  I attempted to give this place a second chance, but was unable to, due to being \"understaffed.\" It was a Friday evening around 630, the two of us walked in and noticed there were multiple open tables. We approached the hostess, and she told us we would have to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated for the waitstaff to \"get caught up\". I specifically asked if we could just sit down in one of the 4 open tables that we could see and she said, \"not yet because the staff is behind.\" I am not sure who runs this place, but that is very poor service. They could have easily said, \"we are a little behind due to an unexpected rush, it might take 20 minutes to get an order in, but we can seat you and get you a soda or cocktail while you wait\" and honestly, I would have been fine with that, but instead they lost an opportunity to earn money and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to succeed. It was nice having sushi in the arrowhead area. However, the last two times I've visited the service was TERRIBLE. Half my order was missing, when I finally flagged down a waitress she was essentially useless and didn't understand that my order was messed up. We used to come here weekly but after my last few experiences we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came on a relatively slow night and did the Teppanyaki. Started of w/ drinks for my wife and I at the bar first, both tasted great and were not watered down (always a plus) . The show was the same you get at bennihanas and to be honest, the food was just as good. My wife and I had the steak and shrimp and the kids both had steak kids portions. Everyone loved the food and had a fair amount of leftovers. Service was prompt and friendly through the whole experience. 5 stars all around. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My father and I were in the area for a few days and tried some of the local restaurants. We had a wonderful experience at Osaka. The sushi chef was friendly, attentive, and proud of his work. The sushi was delicious with a fabulous presentation. Our server was attentive, kind, and thoughtful. We also each had a very reasonably priced sake bomber and delicious gyoza appetizer. With good food, good service, good atmosphere, and good prices, Osaka was a hit. I would highly recommend it and would certainly return."}
{"text":"Jerimaha was a a magnificent cook he was very social and funny and really kind and stephanie was a wonderful waitress she was very kind and polite this the best tepinaki I have ever had and I will definetly come back cause if these two people"}
{"text":"We eat Osaka once or twice a week, just depends how we are feeling. On our last visit we got there at 9pm for Teppenyaki. We always come semi late. Look if you don't wanna do it until 930 do not offer it until 930. We were seated immediately and our server told us she would be back in two minutes. The server was literally gone for a good 15-20 minutes, after telling us she would be back in two. Now I get what that were doing, they probably wanted to see if anyone else was going to come in so they didn't have to clean another table and bring out a cook for another party; but that is absolutely no reason to ignore paying customers for that amount of time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have visited this place three times over a six month period since they opened.  Each time we've gone we have enjoyed ourselves immensely with both the atmosphere of the place, the humorous chefs and the excellent wait staff.  Two of the occasions were birthday events in which they went all out having us wear these funny hats while they sang happy birthday.  Our chefs have always been funny and love to give out saki to the guests while they cook (and I don't much care for saki).  The sushi has been some of the best that I've tried (and I have a very limited amount of sushi that I eat) and the prices are right on par with what I expect.  Their Teppan grill food has a large variety for almost any taste and they'll cater to any special requests you may have (I eat it all, so they don't worry about it).  My girlfriend had their Strawberry Saki last time we were there and said it was really delicious.  I tried some, but since I'm not a Saki person in general, I didn't much care for it, but it did have a good, fruity flavor.  We're already planning our next trip here and, next time, we'll be bringing the kids along with us so they can experience it."}
{"text":"I once came here 3x in one week! The hibachi grill has to be my favorite. All the chefs here are hilarious and throw in a few jokes to go along with their performance of intense knife flipping. How they manage to do that w/o losing an eye or finger is beyond me! The food is always delicious--I suggest the chicken or shrimp with rice on the hibachi grill. I've tried beef too but the chicken/veg rice combo is my fave! I've also tried a lunch special here which was delicious but I think the food made with performance is the best!"}
{"text":"I think it would have been really fun with a big group.  We went on a slow Thursday night and got sat next to random people.  The chef was entertaining, tossing food and shooting sake into your mouth.  I have been to other teppanyaki places such as the Benihana chain and other various ones in California.  This one was by far the best I have been to.  The quality of food was really good, they have the best fried rice I've ever tried.  We got prime steak, chicken, and shrimp.  The steak was really good quality that it melted in your mouth.  Chicken was a bit dry for my taste.  Shrimp was cooked well, not over cooked and rubbery.    We came here for lunch on a Sunday to try out the sushi.  As a California native I had high expectations for fresh sushi and was skeptical about sushi in AZ because come on how can it be fresh without bodies of water around?  I was wrong,  it was really fresh sushi.  We had Ono(white tuna), tuna, and yellowtail, absolutely delicious! I was feeling adventurous that day as well so we got the live uni, when I tried it previously it was pretty \"ocean like\"  but this time it was really good.  It was my boyfriends first time trying it and he thought it was good.    It was kind of pricey but all teppanyaki and Japanese places seem to be.    Excited for the next time we go!"}
{"text":"Called ahead & spoke with Sky. She said it would be about a minute 20 wait for a table. We arrived and just had a short time to be seated at the Teppan table. Sky was great with getting everything prepped and ready for us! Very professional & efficient.. We were there to celebrate my daughters 15th Birthday. All in our party had the Teppan specials. It's a choice of two items in a combination plate served with fried rice, grilled veggies, miso soup and ginger salad. Enjoyed our teppanyaki chef who was entertaining and made it fun! My daughter was greeted at the end of our meal with a big birthday custom Japanese head dress as the surrounding staff sang Happy Birthday to her. They then brought a delectable chocolate dessert not just for her, but for everyone at our table. The food was good, atmosphere high spirited & the employees were exceptional! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great place for teppanyaki. Went there to celebrate our daughter's birthday today. Our server Georgee was great and very attentive. Our chef Gary was funny and entertaining me made us laugh the entire time. Servings were big. Sushi was fresh, but the sashimi was cut so big. Would be back next time for teppanyaki for sure."}
{"text":"I went out last night for my sister in laws birthday for a good time and we had a GREAT time. We had reservations but waited for longer than I would have liked. The waiting area is hot and over crowded. We ordered sushi and appetizers which were delivered quickly. My drinks were always filled and my waitress was great. The cook that performed was hilarious and very entertaining. He made the whole experience very fun. It was a little louder than I would have liked. We also had a free birthday treat that was delicious! Thanks for the good service and great time!"}
{"text":"I've had some good hibachi, but that was by far the best. The waitress and cook both apologized for some rude behavior of the customers at our table...and it wasn't their fault. Worth the money.."}
{"text":"Excellent meal,  great entertainment and the chef was a lot of fun.   The sake is very good too.   This place is easy better now that it's not hooters any more   we'll be back to this one."}
{"text":"Passed this numerous time finally decided to try Called in for reservations we were seated immediately and server was very attentive Our chef was on point great conversation and entertainment But the best part it's very reasonable (not over priced) and they give you plenty of food We will be back"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Prices on Sushi are ridiculous. 3 Roles, huge salad and a Miso Soup cost me 15 Dollars. Service was a tad slow, but the sushi was awesome and cheap."}
{"text":"This is one of my AZ favorites! I have yet to try their tempanayaki section, since I always go to the other section since everything about it from the workers, environment, food, price is just a good quality experience. The happy hour menu is amazing!!! Even when it's not happy hour I like ordering from the happy hour menu even when it's not happy hour because I feel like the \"better\" rolls are on there. There are tons of variety in rolls, they have the classics and the simple ones too, all made well! The workers making the rolls really know how to put the sushi together. Their waiters are always patient, friendly and have been helpful. One of the best sushi places I have experienced."}
{"text":"Had some beautiful veggie rolls. No fishy taste, great flavor and presentation. Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great teppanyaki! The filet was perfectly flavored and cooked. The shrimp was fresh and large.  The chicken was just average, but hey that's chicken. The fried rice was perfect and the vegetables were great, I only wish they used less onion.  Our chef was so funny and he really made the experience a lot of fun.  Beware though- if you turn down the sake bottle, they will pull out a baby bottle for you instead!   Make a reservation, especially on weekends. Seems to be a very popular birthday party spot. They even give you and your guests free coffee flavored tiramasu if it's your birthday."}
{"text":"Amazing. This is the place you take people to show off your Japanese knowledge of food. The sashimi is perfectly prepared. Tried the makeral, octopus and sea bass. Great atmosphere and drink specials. I tried the sake. They have a comprehensive list for beginners to understand."}
{"text":"Was my first teppanyaki (sp?) ever. Well I loved the experience, finally able to feel it first hand.  Our cook was good and friendly, constanly squirting us with the house sake. I had almost 50 counts of the sake, before the cook had to give up lol. and I am a vegetarian, so I had the veggie teppanyaki, which is pretty much fried rice and grilled veggies. It was ok, nothing fancy, but the ginger sauce was good and so was endamame. The place is not cheap, so beware. The service of the waiters could be better."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went with friends Saturday night..squid salad AMAZING! Salmon Lover plate yummy...all rolls were fantastic and made with brown rice! Everything was so good we went back last night( Monday) for Happy Hour.Sat at sushi bar this time and met Pak..one of the owners. Had to have thee squid salad again..and Pak made amazing purple rice shrimp tempura, spicy salmon and spider roll. All delicious. Plus 20 % off food during happy hour. We chatted with Pak and were so impressed with his story. If you want sushi..don't go to a chain resturant...visit Pak and Osaka P83 and help out a owner providing for his family and serving the community.."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying thank you to the staff that helped me with my proposal to my now fiance. I was so nervous that things wouldn't work out as I had pictured but they couldn't have turned out better. I had the bartender take her ring and put it in the bottom of a champagne glass. I made a toast and once she was done with her glass I got down on one knee. Not only did the drinks come out at a perfect time but the bartender added cherries to the bottom of the glasses so the ring didn't stick out right away. Everyone was shocked which is the reaction I was going for. Even the table across the way asked what we were drinking because it just looked so cute! The staff was happy to be a part of our day and wished us well as we left.   Now to get to the food part... I have been to many hibachi grills across the U.S. and I will say Osaka is up there on the list of the best! The family and friends that were there that night had not ever had this experience so needless to say they were blown away. Our chef was great and he had us laughing! The food was to die for and it truly felt like dinner and a show! Osaka is most certainly a gem and will always have a special place in my heart for making such an important day one to remember!"}
{"text":"My son chose Osaka for his birthday dinner and we were not disappointed! We had dinner in the teppenyaki room. We enjoyed the show and the food.  We had steak, calamari, chicken, and swordfish. The calamari was the star of the dinner. the birthday treat-- a tiramisu --was incredible. I  woukd order it for dessert any time! The family is already asking when we can come back."}
{"text":"Pretty diverse menu of Japanese food. Half the restaurant is table and booth seating while the other is Teppanyaki (where they grill in front of you). We ordered garlic green beans, sushi roll, and tonkastu curry. Everything was fresh and came out in a timely manner. Wish I remembered the name of the roll I ordered but it honestly was one of my favorite sushi I have ever had."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today at 11:15 a.m.  and after waiting a long time they came to take our order. We are told the lunch menu isn't available on Saturdays, a little annoying as the menu doesn't say that but ok. We then start to order, my wife orders 30 worth of sushi, I order a 22 dollar teppan as does my friend. Then I attempt to order the junior steak teppan for my 12 year old daughter. The server says no she is too old and says she will have to order an adult portion. My daughter would not have finished the junior portion and there is no way I am going to spend over 20 dollars for my daughter to eat a fraction especially when my party have already ordered 3 adult dinners for over 70 for a Saturday lunch.  We just paid for our drinks and left. The server was rude and this place is not family friendly at all."}
{"text":"Great service! Our waitress was friendly and remembered the small requests I made. I got the sashimi salad which was a decent size with mixed greens N mix of cubed variety of sashimi. I enjoyed it!   I'll be back to try the rolls and other things next time."}
{"text":"The most fun and entertaining dinner! Thus was my 3rd time to this location and it was even better! We had a friend in from out of town and wanted to show him a good time, so we got a reservation here!  Our chef was amazing and funny and kept the sake coming! It was our friends birthday,  so he got the royal treatment!   The food was so great. We all enjoy sushi beforehand -the Rockstar roll is my favorite!    A friend said \"I didn't have one bite that wasn't awesome \" :)  Good times!"}
{"text":"Prices run a little high here for sushi, but for the hibachi, it's pretty average. I only come here for the hibachi anyways, but the chefs are always nice, friendly, and entertaining."}
{"text":"Tried the teppenyaki side during a weekday for lunch. The food and price was pretty darn awesome. Found out Teppenyaki is half off weekdays before 2:30, so I got soup, salad, shrimp, fried rice, salmon filet, lobster tail, and mixed vegetables for $15. Such a good value and pretty delicious. A LOT of butter is slathered on every single item, but it does not seem overly oily and buttery.   Crispy shrimp, Edamame, and calamari were also pretty tasty. Sauces were good.  Service was slow... We were the only teppen table.. And it took about 20 minutes before they guy started the show and there were maybe 2 other tables not doing teppen during that time. I think our waiter was new...He was nice though."}
{"text":"So a girlfriend and I came to check this place out. We've never gone. We called to see where exactly they were located and the hostess was unsure...the hostess responded with \"I'm not exactly sure!\" Well, that wasn't reassuring! She finally responded with do you know where red lobster is in Gilbert? Oh my goodness...ok so yes, of course we do! We got to the restaurant and was asked if we were there for the Teppan? We said No, we're here for sushi - the young girl sat us right away...she gave us the special menu...nothing of the other regular  roll was on the menu. Their special menu roll were all in the $20's....ummmm ya, no! We're here to eat just the normal rolls...none of the fancy rolls, please. So we asked the young girl if they had another menu for normal rolls. She looked at me like I was dumb and said yes, I'll bring it over. We waited for 5 minutes while we can clearly see her just standing at the front. So I go over to her and request for their regular menu again and she responds with a ditzy \"oh ya!\" with a fake smile. We placed our order and I actually ordered 1 of their $20 special roll just to see what it's all about. When it came out...oh my! It was definitely a specialty alright! I must say it was actually really good! The service could have been better. The food was fresh & delicious. I know they were hoping for us to spend more money but it doesn't mean you have to give us less of a service. The bus boy was more attentive than the waitress herself. He took our food away when we were done. When we were finally done we had to ask him to find our waitress so we can get our check. So we saw her twice...1st time to take our order and 2nd time to give our check. She never came to see if everything was good or ok or if we we need anything else...I guess that's what she's hoping the bus boy is for...that's pretty pathetic I must say."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service on the wait sucks. We made a reservation and after 30 minutes of having to wait we finally left. Guess our business isn't as important to them."}
{"text":"The BEST hibachi grill that I have ever been to! We made reservations and were seated immediately. The service was stellar and our chef was hilarious. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the chef was very talented.  A great experience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, always greeted as soon as I walk through the door.  I always sit at the cooking table with my husband and it's wonderful.  The cooks/chefs are wonderful and friendly and I always enjoy the experience.  My husband and I moved to Phoenix from Ohio and this was one of the first places we found when looking for a new Japanese restaurant to enjoy and boy do we.  I love the spicy tuna rolls and the chicken and steak teppanyaki is delicious.  I've run into a handful of travellers each time I come and the conversation is always entertaining.  If we're in a hurry or have hours to spend it's never a worry.  Seriously love this place."}
{"text":"really good! nice place, seemed clean and staff was friendly and courteous. the food was really good- we ate at the grill and the guy doing the cooking was very nice and funny. even with a full table, none of our food ever got cold and he cooked it all very well with showmanship. the man waiting the table was also good, very polite and helpful. We had steak, shrimp, fried rice and veggies along with the sauce, salad and soup they serve with it. It was all really good and seasoned and cooked perfectly! we finally found a good hibachi in AZ and we'll be back many times!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had in Phoenix! The dynamite roll is dynamite!!!! Good quality meat! And a huggge tepanyaki area! Bring the whole family. Did I mention how delicious their garlic green beans are?! So good!!"}
{"text":"Great place overall! Great food decent prices and very entertaining! A great place to go for birthdays!"}
{"text":"Online reservation system doesn't work, walk-ins aren't welcome.  Came herefor my birthday, food was ok. Nothing to write home about, not sure i'd describe the steaks as prime (serious accusation, so I won't go there). Was fun though so I gathered my friends for a husbands/wives night out.   Made a reservation online for teppenyaki, when we walked in they didn't have the reservation in their system. Had the confirmation on my phone for the correct location/date/time, still didn't help. .. And since they only had 2 chefs on staff (weird for 7:30 on a Friday night) they wouldn't be able to seat us for 45min. Even though I had a genuine complaint, they were completely unwilling to comp ANYTHING not even some sushi while we waited. Made zero attempt to keep us the restaurant, very bad business model. Teppenyaki options are limited on the west side, but definitely not returning here. Not going to be in business long if they continue to be so unwilling to accept people coming in from the street, especially being so close to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Took years to sit us down and it was completely empty took more years to bring us our drinks smh pissed af straight bull shit"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants by far. Family and friend oriented atmosphere. Entertaining chefs cooking meals before your eyes with continuous customer interaction. Raspberry Soki is a MUST! Food is spectacular, just make sure you clarify your order since they have numerous upcharges."}
{"text":"\"Happy birthday, happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday.\" That's all I heard while dining in at this place. Funny and Kinda awesome. I didn't mention my birthday was the next day. However, this place was amazing. The spicy avocado salad and seaweed salads were amazing. The garlic edamame was delicious. My mother and I enjoyed the Osaka roll which was accompanied by a martini class full of lobster tail and crab salad and the rockstar roll which is excellent for a sushi novice. This is definitely the place for sushi on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were thoroughly impressed. Great service and atmosphere. Very reasonably priced food and drinks. Oyster shooters are a must. No complaints. Everything was great. The Pineapple Upside Down Cake is delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place, the best fresh sushi in Arizona! Since I found out about this place a few months ago I was hooked! My hubby, daughter and l we go there 2-3x a week. We like to sit at the bar and watch them make the sushi. Love everything l have ordered sofar so good."}
{"text":"This is the best Tempenyaki I have had in Arizona. The show was fun and the food was mouth wateringly delicious. I loved the atmosphere, you really can get involved in the whole room. I will definitely be returning with more friends."}
{"text":"My 11 year old requested this restaurant for his birthday dinner. The Teppan is always spot on. The rice is flavorful and meat and seafood is prepared just right. The cocktails can be on the weak side, so you may want to opt for another adult beverage. We've been to the Mesa location several times for family celebrations. This location is close to our home, so we were excited. As always, the food was great and the chef did a fantastic job entertaining our entire family. In fact, they gave us two chefs because our party was large. We were fortunate enough not to have to share our table with anyone else. My only complaint was that after the food was served, we didn't see a server for at least 15-20 minutes. We were waiting for to go containers and the dessert menu. Dessert was free for all of us. It's a yummy light coffee/choc dessert. Overall, you receive food and interactive entertainment all in one. Love the light up glasses for the kids, birthday song with wooden head for the birthday boy and of course, the saki and soda entertainment provided. ;) The laughter around the table makes this place a keeper!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi places in the area. The happy hour sushi menu is great with lots of choice and great prices. On the other side of the restaurant they have Teppanyaki style food which we will try one day when we can pull ourselves away from the sushi. Drinks during happy hour are cheap and for 2 people with drinks and 4 rolls our bill came to less than $30!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi places and this is by far the best food, flavor, quality and quantity for the price. They also have great service and a fun environment. We won't be going anywhere else again."}
{"text":"We have visited the other Osaka location numerous times. My husband loves Teppan so we decided to take him for Father's Day. The other location was fully committed so we gave this one a shot. Wow! I was impressed!!! Their reservations run on time. Shocking when compared to the other location. The cleanliness of the restaurant was impressive and the staff was very friendly. I think the food was better quality at this location. My husband says I just liked the environment more. Either way we will visit this location from now on."}
{"text":"Awsome place to go for dinner or lunch. Staff is very friendly and very attentive. Food was ready fast. No wait time. The chief was very active and entertaining. I will be back."}
{"text":"Coming from the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi Capital of the World (Reno, NV), I'm hesitant to drop the cash to eat sushi elsewhere, but when the craving hits, I can't say no!   Our group of four each ordered about four rolls a piece and we all left with half of it boxed up.  Let me just say, these rolls are gargantuan! It's important to note, the size was not a factor of how much rice was used, as I could hardly detect any, but was mostly due to the overload of imitation crab and spicy tuna / spicy salmon, depending on the roll. With lots of creative combinations, my favorite were the Rockstar Roll and the Osaka Roll, which was a steep $20.   Unfortunately, they up charge for fish substitutions and the atmosphere tips just over obnoxious with an incessant house-beat thumping monotonously in the background. While the quality is good, this place isn't anything special. I'd come back to try the teppanyaki, if I had some earplugs on-hand."}
{"text":"Osaka did it again! Thank you for making my sister-in-laws birthday bash a memorable one. We will definitely be back for future family birthdays and celebrations. *****5 Stars for good food, great service and a top notch show."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here regularly. Prices are good, and the sushi is delicious. They have recently added more items to their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Cool low key place! The service was slow took us 15 minutes to get drinks after we got sat. Our habachi chef was beyond amazing!! The food was delicious and more than enough for lunch the next day. Did get his name but the chef from NM. :) The service wasn't up to par for the price we were paying."}
{"text":"This was the BEST teppenyaki my mom and I have ever eaten! We got the dinner for 2 chicken, filet, shrimp and scallops. Everything was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The show was really fun too!"}
{"text":"Godzilla roll! It's amazing. They also have a killer happy hour. It's m-f from 2:30-6:00, open to 5:00 on sat and sunday. Their yellowtail appetizer is also great. The spring salad is HUGE. Very fresh, ask for the ginger dressing though!"}
{"text":"OMG! Go for raw fish appetizers! Everyone is super friendly and helpful. The finish the meal on the high note, get pineapple upside down cake"}
{"text":"Went during lunch with family and friends visiting from out of state. They wanted to eat Asian and this restaurant came highly recommended.   After taking our drink orders, the hibachi cook looked at us with extremely frustrating in his eyes. I,  thinking I was seeing things didn't say anything didn't ask any questions. But, one of my out of town guests did. He asked, is there a problem? You are expressing and we're getting a very negative energy from you. He mumbled something under his voice and said no problem. He began to bang silverware around very aggressively and after cooking our food he pointed rudely to my plate.    And our lunch one of the other guests said, hey he didn't give us any sauces for our steaks. Thanks when we brought it to the attention of the manager who apologized and said you should of asked for the sauces. I said, my role as a patron isn't to reminded your staff what is acceptable behavior. Especially when we're paying a premium.    She offered green ice cream after we paid our bill.   I'll never see another penny of mine, my friends, or any of my businesses money ever again.  Wish there was. - rating.   An Absolutely horrible experience and embarrassing and uncomfortable in-front of my peers and colleagues."}
{"text":"Took my Mom and Sister out for a belated Mothers Day dinner.  Sister wanted teppen so she recommended this place for dinner.  I got there before the rest of the party so I ask how long the wait for a teppan table would be.  She informed me that they only had one Chef on tonight so the wait would be about 45 minutes for a table.  I let my party know that when they arrived so they decided to get a regular table instead.   The greeters at the door were very polite and helpful.  But that is all that was good from then on.  The waitress took our order of both sushi and teppan.  She never made attempt to check on us and we had to call her over to refill out drinks.  The teppan dishes were really good and the sushi as well.  We ordered a couple of rolls of different styles oh sushi and when we were done with our meal and very full, the waitress brought us another roll.  We asked her why wasn't this brought out earlier and that we didn't want it.  She took it back and still charged us for it.  She didn't want to take it off and so we decided to take it to go.  The food is great and if we decide to go back hopefully the service is better."}
{"text":"They provide NO \"Nutrition Facts\". I don't expect it to be printed on the menu but why don't you even offer it as a courtesy when asked?   With food allergies and special diet requirements this is a must for anyone with peanut, gluten, dairy, allergies or just someone looking to count calories or carbs.  Shame on you Osaka, you are not the low cost leader when it comes to dinning so it can't be a cost value on return concern."}
{"text":"I ate here a while ago, and it was really super! The food was fantastic,, superb!! and  the chef was very entertaining. He gave us lots of saki, and some free birthday cake. I can't wait to go back,  it's a little expensive but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great experience everytime. Very pleasant staff and amazing food. Teppanyaki tables are great and entertaining."}
{"text":"they lost my reservation and i smelled terrible after.  was not impressed with service in the bar.  not going back."}
{"text":"The food was really great! Sushi tasted fresh, and was prepared very elegantly. However, I took a star off for service. The food came out pretty uneven, hot dishes for two of our guests came out about 5-10minutes before our sushi came out. Not a huge deal, just seemed like bad timing. The biggest problem wasn't that service was hard to get, it's that between the manager, busboy, and our server we were constantly being interrupted. Manager came and asked us how things were while we were just drinking water, and the waitress came asking if we needed more water every 5minutes. When you go out, you don't want to be interrupted every few minutes by the restaurant staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fun place to celebrate a birthday.  The cooks were hilarious and really made for r a fun evening!!Make reservations way in advance as some nights they book up weeks in advance."}
{"text":"Great spot. Started with a sushi roll that was very tasty. Sat at hibachi table. Shrimp appetizer comes with the meal. Shrimp was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Fried rice was great. Chef was very nice and entertaining. For my entree I had filet mignon and scallops. Filet was so tender it was like butter! Scallops were great too, cooked perfectly. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"My new fav local place to have sushi. They have a very extensive happy hour menu with a good variety of rolls. I normally stick to sashimi but their rolls are really good. I like they don't load up on rice. I would prefer no rice but they do a good job on letting the seafood be the focus.  Service has always been great. Sat at the sushi bar both times. The only thing is the sushi bar is so high up. Even when I stand up it towers over me and the sushi chefs don't chat or interact with you. But maybe that's why the bar is so high. Lol.   We are going to try their teppan for my birthday. Hopefully it's just as good."}
{"text":"Friendly and speedy service. Fun and clean atmosphere. Food was great. Price was a little high but it is in the same ball park as other competitors. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Always a fun place to go and food is great. Good cooked at table. One in party was shorted chicken in combo but they made it right."}
{"text":"I was impressed.  I really like the darkness and decor.  It is nice to go there for lunch and get away from work.  Food was good.  I had the sweet potato rolls and something with spicy salmon that I can't remember the name.  I liked that they had more vegetarian roll options. Service was good.  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This temponai is amazingi love it the best is chicken and steak everybody go here its the best"}
{"text":"Had the steak and lobster. It was all cooked perfect and tastes outstanding. I would recommend this place to everyone and next time we make the trip down from Prescott well be coming here again."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and a very good price during happy hour. 2:30-6pm (mon-fri I think)  The Godzilla roll was fantastic, something I will get again.  everything we tried was very good but I think I will continue to go during happy hour."}
{"text":"teppanyaki with a good a maki selection...  benihana started it [i think] and everyone else followed suit.  the same ole song and dance (literally) at the fired grill but out of all the teppanyakis i've dined at, this one had the most personal service by the servers themselves - constantly checking in, cracking jokes along with the chef, etc.  i'm reviewing to rave about the pokeman roll - i.e. sweet potato tempura maki.  i'm quite the sweet potato roll connoisseur and this was one of the best - topped with mango and dried cranberries and perfectly battered potato - not too heavy on the breading or oil.  i would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"New happy hour menu start today. Everyday Monday - Sunday 2:30 -6pm  Tuesday $1 sake all day with original, strawberry, cucumber, vanilla, or peach flavor. Also 50% off premium bottle sake"}
{"text":"Nice to see a Japanese restaurant in the area. We didn't try the teppanyaki but we dined in instead. We arrived around 6:30pm and was able to get a table with no wait. The food was quite delicious and portion-wise, it was very reasonable. I had the ramen with shrimp, and my husband had the beef and chicken plate."}
{"text":"My favorite hibachi place closed down so I was in the look out for a new spot. What actually attracted me to go here instead of Ah-So was the photos of the restaurant. This place definitely has nice decor and I loved it, it was even nicer in person. This would be a very nice place to bring someone on a date.  It looks small from the outside but it is quite big inside, they have a separate area from the regular dining and teppanyaki. I made a reservation online for Easter at 6pm on a Sunday and requested a hibachi chef with the best showmanship for an entertaining show and I definitely received one! Sadly, I did not catch his name but I can say he was a Hispanic man. It was not busy for a Sunday dinner when the parking lot looked packed full.  Now for the service, I read the reviews prior to coming here but I wanted to give the place the benefit of the doubt. My family came here at 6pm however I did arrive 20 minutes after them, I texted my sister to get me water and she responded saying the waitress has not got to them. It was probably about 10 minutes after my arrival until she came to take our drink orders. I don't even want to know how long the group next to us (who came before my family did) was waiting, they didn't look too happy. Our waitress's name was Amy, there was two other teppanyaki shows going on but she wasn't the only waitress. After our chef came out and started serving us the fried rice we had so many soup and salad bowls still clustered around us my group pilled it up and set it at the end of our table, the group next to us had to get up and move their bowls to the empty hibachi grill table next to them since there was no room for them at the end of their table. Everyone's drink was also empty for while before she came around to get refills (this was the only time she came back around to check up on us). After the chef was done and we finished eating, everyone had to sit around for awhile before she came back to ask us if we're ready for the bill and needed boxes. I would say it took about 30 minutes after being done eating to get our bill and cards back before we left.  I don't want to give it a lower rating because maybe they're just always short on staff which does need fixing with so many complaints on here, but I do think the performance and the interior design is phenomenal. The food was great and I had a little bit of everything off the grill. Because of the service, I will be still on the look out for my new favorite hibachi spot but if I come here again I know to order two glasses of water instead of one."}
{"text":"This place is great !!!! Their sushi is really good at a decent price. Love that they have happy hour everyday. I had a to go order and I really enjoyed my meal and the quality of the sushi. I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I wanted to treat my parents to a teppanyaki meal. We had our heart set in going to their competitors location in Chandler, but decided to come here instead.  The good: The filet and lobster dish was really great and perfectly cooked. I wish they had some lemon butter on the side to dip the lobster in. My parents also enjoyed their filet. Second, their style of miso/mushroom soup was pretty delicious and nothing like I have ever tasted before. I really enjoyed it.  The bad: The salad was meh...some of the iceberg lettuce already had brown spots and my husband said it didn't taste fresh. We also decided to order their version of fried mozzarella. What we received was far from a fried mozzarella dish. I did not even see cheese nor oozing gooey cheese. I did not even want to get close to that dish after looking at my hubby's face after tasting it.  All in all, we will not go back. I was expecting an over the top experience and amazing quality which unfortunately fell flat."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. The sushi was delicious! If your looking for a new Sushi place to try instead of the same old same old this spot is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The big seller here isn't the teppan - it's the SUSHI!  Love the Sushi - love the drinks - love the birthday celebration!  Bring your birthday friends and have a blast!"}
{"text":"Its our number one favorite. Best service awesome food. Cant say anything else. Just love it."}
{"text":"Osaka is awesome, the bartender is amazing and is really great at achieving my needs. The happy hour specials are really good on the rolls and drinks! Every time I go I get salmon sashimi, it's my favorite! Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We decided to try Osaka's happy hour last night and this place is a winner!    Our dining experience included friendly-efficient service, high quality food, clean environment, and reasonable prices with an extensive happy hour offering.  We sampled a variety of rolls and appetizers, and everything was exceptional, A++.   The only other thing I'd mention is the place has only been been open a few weeks and it was already quite crowded for a Wednesday night.  The happy hour dining area is fairly small, since it's primarily a teppanyaki joint.  We arrived at 5:30 and barely got a table.  So arrive early for happy hour as more people learn about this place."}
{"text":"This place is where me and my woman go for a treat, we have a great time no matter who we sit with....Saki is awesome as well as the Chef's. We would go once a month if we could thank you for being a awesome place to visit!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and i usually come here for celebrations but after tonight we wont come back at all. Japanese place run with nothing but white people? No thanks. Might sound racist but i dont care. Their service used to be attentive and actually accurate. Ordered a Mojito and did not get asked for my ID, (im 22) then 10 minutes later she asks for my ID. The place isnt packed so there shouldnt be an excuse why the drink wouldnt be in my hand. 20 minutes later, no drink. The sushi was gross, iv had better from Frys. Yeah i said it. Go to Benihana's, youll pay the same and get a better show, not to mention service. No apology for the 40 minute, watered down Mojito."}
{"text":"Eh, well..like before, I have had great service and food there, but...we went ON A RESERVATION on Valentine's Day..and the whole habachi area was waiting not only on food, but service for almost 40 minutes, I don't know if a huge chunk of staff walked out earlier that day or what...but it was crazy, when we finally ordered, our sushi was wrong, but they did make up for it with w free drink..the food is always amazing, but they need to work on the hospitality or they might lose big....I will go back again because of the food."}
{"text":"Addicted to sake Tuesday's! Great food on happy hour. We are weekly customers. Some awesome waiters will rock your socks! However, we have had a few AWFUL waiters too. Stick to the sushi bar if your waiter does not speak a lot of English, he puts in the wrong orders and demands tips before he gives you your card back."}
{"text":"Really great experience. We made reservations for four for a Saturday night. We were seated almost immediately and the waitress was waiting for us. She took our drink order and they came out very quick.   The teppanyaki chef was incredible and the folks at our table seemed to enjoy the entertainment and food as much as we did."}
{"text":"Thanks for a great dinner!!! The sushi was excellent. The tepan chef Gary was friendly and fun. The tepan food was fresh and flavorful. Large portions, we all had to take food home. The atmosphere was upbeat!!! I understand they are under new management."}
{"text":"This place is way better then benihana.  The atmosphere the staff the experience is amazing.   The chefs really entertain you while they cook and the best part FREE SAKE SHOTS.  While they cook they take a ketchup looking bottle full of sake and squirt it in your mouth till you can't take no more.    The food is delicious and if it's your bday they make you wear a mask and they beat a drum while singing happy bday.  This place is clean and awesome.    I do recommend reservations since it can get packed at night,  this is my second time here and I will be coming back a lot more.    This place is a must try for everyone to enjoy"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money on this place.  The service we received wasn't bad.  The sushi on the other hand needs some serious help.  I ordered three rolls.  All three looked as if they were on the happy hour price list, even though we paid full price.  Small and not a lot of sushi inside.  The purple, yes purple rice wasn't explained to us prior to it arriving at your table.  I mentioned the small sized sushi, and never received a comment from the manager..... The sushi wasn't great by any means, not great on taste or appearance. We also had to wait 20 minutes for the sushi, did I forget to mention there was only 3 other tables being occupied, and one already had their food.   This is our second and last appearance to this spot.  I wish I had of read the other reviews before giving this establishment a second chance."}
{"text":"Have been here now several times for dinner and it's always amazing! Great show with excellent food. Highly recommend for large group or birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"Bad experience.  Food wasn't good at all and chef was mad that he didn't get a tip for being boring and bad food . Kept giving us dirty looks. Service was good though .sorry but we will never return here . Kobi steakhouse is 10 times better"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it!  Came with our kids to celebrate a birthday and we were all entertained and our tummies were satisfied.  We had teppanyaki dinners and sushi from the bar and all was delicious!  We also were able to use a $25 gift certificate with no hassle, towards our dinner after signing up on the osakaaz.com website.  Service was great plus $1 sake night on Tuesdays?  Can't get any better!  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Shrimp tempura roll was bad. No taste at all. Service was Terrible, waited 15 min to get the water. Messed up our order and didn't do anything about it.. How are they in business?.."}
{"text":"Checked this place out. Our usual sushi spot was closed so we happened upon this place by driving by it. It was excellent! The atmosphere is relaxed the decor nice. The drinks were great and the sushi was delicious. Even my 8 year old loved this restaurant and he's tough to please. I highly recommend to anybody looking for fine sushi!"}
{"text":"The portions here are very generous. The sashimi is succulent and tender. The Pink Lady Roll is fabulous! And the staff is friendly. We came for sushi on a whim and were seated right away while those here for Tepanyaki were better off with a reservation."}
{"text":"Really really tasty Tepanyaki. Service was great and the atmosphere/music was cool. Our chef was entertaining but not annoying and the food was great! Also very reasonably priced. MUCH better than Benihana which I also tried recently and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for a good sushi spot. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy but not overwhelming busy. Great location with lots around and lots of parking available. We were greeted and seated right away in a booth.  We were happy with the pricing (happy hour offered all day or until 5pm?) and service was fair. We ordered 3 rolls which was a lot, edamame, gyoza and my daughter got the teriyaki chicken. We expected smaller portions as you usually get with happy hour and ended up taking a lot home.   We were disappointed with the sushi. When it arrived we were very excited because it looked delicious. We dug right in and realized after trying each one that it was lacking flavor. Very odd as there was tons of different sauces on all of them. At first I thought it was my taste buds but my husband had said the same thing when I asked which was his favorite. The rest of the food was good and my girls finished all of it.   Next time we'll try the teppan yaki grill."}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious experience! My boyfriend and I went when we wanted to have a good time in the middle of the week, and man did we! It seems like a place to go when it's your \"birthday\". We sat at the teppan grill and both ordered the sesame chicken and some sushi. The sushi was surprisingly delicious! The rest of the food was also very good. Be prepared to spend some money, but it's worth it to be in such a fun atmosphere. The cooks are hilarious and play fun games while they cook your food. I made a lot of special requests to my food and they gladly accommodated! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"To start with the chef was very bland there was no fun show to watch, he was more worried about getting his job done so he could move on to the next one. Secondly all the meat was over cooked, the steak was well done when it was supposed to be medium. All the fish had a thick crust and was well past done, the salmon was basically jerky. So not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and very inexpensive!! I love everything that they cook. Went with my 4 year old son and they made a special artistic bear dessert made from and orange. I will be going back! #osakalove #delicious"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our visit here! Our service was pretty terrible! Seemed like our server was also working behind the bar so that explains why he wasn't around much. Food took forever to arrive and half our food was forgotten. We had to keep asking for it and then everything was bland, dry and quickly thrown together. Didn't even eat half my food because it was awful. Complained to our server and nothing was done or even apologized for. We won't be back here. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Love having a great sushi place right around the corner! This place has amazing food and an awesome atmosphere. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. They make sure that you are taken care of and they anticipate your needs, drinks are refilled and empty platws cleared with out being asked.  They have some great specialty rolls that I've never had anywhere else but they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was so plain, curry has no taste. It looked good but it did not taste anything like curry. Gyoza was soggy. I lived in Japan for years and this restaurant does not even come close to being an authentic Japanese restaurant. There are many other Japanese restaurants in PHX/Chandler/Gilbert that serve better food. Service was OK."}
{"text":"Oh their rock shrimp appetizer is wonderful. Don't pass it up!  And of course our sushi was fantastic!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Back in Mesa, and of course we have to have our weekly fix of sushi at Osaka.  Nice to see some of the familiar faces from last season and meet the new bartenders.  The sushi tastes fresh and love their many options for sushi rolls.  Best garlic beans and shrimp tempura salad. One day we will try the teppan room, but for now we all enjoy our weekly outing to Osaka's!"}
{"text":"Great place and good food. Great service from most! The hostess at the front looked pissed off at the world the whole time."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. I haven't tried the teppanaki area yet. We come about once a week mentally prepared for bad service. The wait staff seems lost, if you order appetizers they tend to always forget one of them. When the we order sushi rolls those come out fairly quick but ordering sushi by the piece usually is brought as we are finished with everything else. We always have to remind them about it. If you buy alcoholic beverages they are quick to ask if you want another. But it you order a soft drink or tea you have to look for them and flag them down for a refill."}
{"text":"I've been to Benihana so I was expecting a similar experience and was totally blown away by the fact that I could order happy hour as well as nothing on teppenyaki menu if I didn't so desire. Plus they shoot Sake into your mouth if you want!! I did not want teppenyaki so I ordered 2 sushi rolls, the Fuji and the Crazy Roll both were delicious!  I also ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and the Pepper Ahi.  The pepper ahi was light and refreshing and really delicious with the ponzu.  But the Jalapeno Poppers were the shining star of my meal, I wanted something creamy and spicy and I was expecting what you normally get, the little balls of some sort of pepper and cream cheese, however these were actual jalapenos with cream cheese and crabbed plus fried, but since the jalapeno wasn't over cooked there was a nice crunchy fresh feeling to the whole meal, I haven't stopped talking about them since lunch on Saturday!  I can't wait to go get more! Then we finished it off with tempura ice cream, which is one of my favorite things!"}
{"text":"\"Cotton candy, laced in gold.  Stack that money,¬†sushi¬†roll.  Bottles up, feeling throw'd .  V.I.P it, overload.\" ? Iggy Azalea, My World  After a long weekend of being off-the-grid where we had 5-min lukewarm showers daily, wind-burn action left and right, and being covered in trout slime for like three days, we wandered back into town and headed to Osaka Japanese Steakhouse for Happy Hour.  I'm surprised they let me in because I was looking pretty gross.  I think we pretty much ordered one of everything off the Happy Hour menu.  We had an assortment of salads and sushi rolls and everything was delicious.  I appreciated how the rolls weren't heavy on rice and very generous with the fish and other fillings.  Two out of six of us doesn't care for raw fish and they were even satisfied by the selection.  The Picasso and The Vegas Rolls were especially delicious and I want to be back again [to the closer Gilbert location] for these beauties!  I also want to go back for a cocktail!  Gimme that Mango Mai Tai!  This place is truly gorgeous.  The staff here is friendly and service is very prompt.  Never was a glass left half-empty at our table.  5-stars, easily!  I want more fish!"}
{"text":"joe the server was amazing we had a blast he was soo funny and the food was so tasty its a great place for a birthday  we r visiting from california and best service ever he was hilarious and I would go everyday if I could lol"}
{"text":"love this place our server was joe he was so funny my sister enjoyed her birthday first time visit"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, made a reservation for a nice family dinner.... except we still had to wait an HOUR past our reservation time to be seated.  Really?  What's the point of having a reservation system then?  It didn't help that the hostesses were incredibly rude, unapologetic and just flat out unprofessional.  They were so disorganized and appeared to have no idea what they were doing.  Get it together already!  Anyway, the only reason I gave this place 3 stars and I mean the ONLY reason is Gary.  He was our teppanyaki chef and, although I've been to plenty of hibachi restaurants in the past, he was by far the BEST!  Not only did everything he cook taste amazing, but he also was so entertaining my sister in law said her cheeks literally hurt from smiling so much throughout the meal.  Never had such a fun AND delicious dinner before.  Thanks Gary - you were worth the one hour wait."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with my family tonight and we had a blast!  Food was delicious and the chef was really talented and entertaining!  always been a favorite of ours! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times the winter, excellent on all accounts.  Fixed everything I complained about! . A+"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! I would highly recommend this restaurant. I cannot wait to go back. We celebrated my husband's birthday and it was wonderful. Kid friendly and fun for all ages."}
{"text":"Playboy roll is great, avocado roll is good, service was good and prompt. the rest of the rolls we had where also good. the rice was perfect and it did not fall apart like at some other places. family ordered teppan food which the chef did a great job with the cooking and the show, better than benihana. prices are really fair for sushi. will come here everytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food was alright. The roll I had tasted fine, and looked very fancy but was too large to bite, not sure how I was supposed to eat it. There was wayyyy too much caviar on it as well. My Meal was 20$, reasonable price I guess. My boyfriends was 15$, unreasonable price for what he got. Ten small slices of cold chicken with teriyaki sauce on a single scoop of rice and a very small amount of vegetables on the side. It did however cone with a soup and salad. Both of which where not very good either, soup was just broth. And the salad was still very much uncut.  All together it was definitely NOT worth the 40$ I spent on it, neither of us finished out food or desired to. Will not be returning. Very nice server though, very attentive."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp when we got there we wasn't greeted I ask to be seated at the shushi bar the place was practically empty it took a while for a waitress to serve us i ordered a drink when I got the drink it barely had alcohol in it when we ordered the food was very good at the end of the dinner we noticed roaches on the wall saw one then more came out I told the waitress she didn't do anything about it I was grossed out i won't be eating here again"}
{"text":"It's borderline shocking to me that this place isn't a bigger deal. Their sushi prices are so much better than anywhere else I've found in Arizona. The happy hour (4:30-6) provides legitimate sushi rolls with excellent portions at $3 a pop, and all of their rolls are HALF PRICE every Monday.   As a sushi lover, this place would be a godsend at those prices if the sushi was merely adequate, but it's actually really, really good. To be honest, I feel a little guilty going there and ordering large amounts of sushi for a relatively small amount of money. And yet, it's almost never busy.  Do yourself a favor if you love affordable sushi, and check this place out before they change their specials."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 12 people for my wifes birthday. I called to confirm, was all set. I asked them to make sure they have a bartender because we are coming for happy hour. We have been there before and no bartender till later. I was assured it was all set. We arrived and there was no bartender. The hostess called the manager who showed up about 20 minutes later to play bartender. Unfortunately the manager couldnt keep up, some waited over 45 minutes for a drink. The waitress didnt know what to do except to keep apologizing. Flora the waitress felt sincerely bad. The manager on the other hand needs to take lessons in customer service. Lets just keep it at rude and obviously didnt care. He just lost 12 peoples business. If I were the owner he would be gone. Very poorly ran business."}
{"text":"The lunch prices are great. You can get a bento box for $8-$12 depending on what you order. I chose the Salmon Teriyaki, and this bento box was 4 stars. The salmon was not dry and cooked perfectly with a light drizzle of teriyaki. My favorite part was the fried rice, which $1 extra but worth the add on charge. It came with the usual additions like miso soup, salad with a creamy carrot ginger dressing, and gyoza. I'm not a big California Roll fan so it's the one thing I didn't finish since I was full from the rest of the food.   I wanted to end on a sweet note, and I shared the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream (3.5 stars). It's not the best version, but I loved the green tea ice cream.   Service (4 stars) was good. Our server immediately asked if the five of us wanted separate checks. The hostesses were also very nice. They also have a Teppanyaki section if you want that type of experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for Teppanyaki for awhile, usually its for special occasions. My last visit was for Valentines day 2017. You can make reservations directly on their website, which I did it makes things go a lot easier. Usually they are super slammed and you'll be waiting awhile for Teppanyaki. I have come here for dinner and its pretty easy to just come in and sit at the bar if your not prepared to spend the time for the fire show. I've always had a good time here, however this last time I felt a bit rushed. For Teppanyaki they usually seat you and give you plenty of time to have appetizers and a few drinks before the cook comes out to fling food around. This time (maybe cause it was Valentines day) we sat down and 5 min later it was ShowTime. We did get the Gyoza (pot-stickers) which I love here, my daughter became vegetarian recently and she ordered the Vegetarian Gyoza, they were surprisingly still tasty! They brought out the soup and salads and the chef got to work! within no time he was flinging food, pouring sake and entertaining out table. I have never had a bad entertainer here, we did have a awkward one a while back.... It was a Mexican dude flinging around food and trying to throw out the Asian accent yelling \"SAKE\"... It was awkward, but he still did a good job. Anyhoo, every time I come here I leave stuffed. The food is delicious, the entertainment is great, and the price is fair... This is def. the go to place in m y area for Teppanyaki!"}
{"text":"I will be back. Tonight was my first time here. I was with my 11 month old daughter (foodie in training) so we couldn't take advantage of the hibachi grill , which I thought would be fun. I did order steak and chicken Teppanaki (sp?) and it was hands down better than Benihana , Sapporo or any other I've been to. The food was so flavorful without being overly dressed with butter . The sushi looked yummy and the service was incredible. I will be back with a bigger crowd besides my side kick foodie in training."}
{"text":"Godzilla is what I remember this place for.  I had all sorts of yummy rolls, but the Godzilla roll was orgasmic.  You can get everything from raw sushi to cooked, and I feel that everything was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Why and how is your fried rice so delicious ! We love this place for Birthdays ! We don't usually eat \"left overs \" but are fighting over these ! Not only was my family entertained during dinner but their servings are so big ! We love this place !"}
{"text":"The absolute best Happy Hour. Just had an Impromptu date night. We ate cucumber salad, peppered ahi Tuna, a spicy girl roll, and dragon roll. So yummy and so fun sitting at the bar. Thanks Levi. You rock!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Yummy in my tummy! Since moving from Ca, I've found a couple of pretty good sushi places, like Gangnam and Sushi Kee, but this place blew them BOTH out of the water! Fresh, flavorful, and just plain tasty rolls and huge pieces of fresh nigiri for the hubby. Very happy. We will be back."}
{"text":"First timer.. wow. Rally classy joint. We were seated fairly promptly albeit communal seating, it think that's part of the experience. I love that the menu had photos which helps a selective eater such as myself order waaaay more than I should. Potstickers were actually probably the best I've ever had.  Flavors were pretty on point for everything actually. I had the spicy seared ahi which was again delicious. My only feedback would be on the size of the rolls, they were massive; almost too large to eat. I'd rather eat my sushi rolls in one bite, so with such large pieces, It almost made me gag. delicious yes, but huge and if you're into that kind of thing, then you'll be in heaven."}
{"text":"My parents came into town from California and were both craving Japanese steakhouse style cooking. Me, being skeptical of any Asian places out here in Arizona (I come from the San Francisco Area...spoiled by the variety out there and skeptical of the choices out in AZ) thought we'd give this place a try.  Definitely surprised with my experience. The customer service was great, our chef was very interactive and the food was delicious.   I can see myself stopping by here often. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting a show and great food for dinner."}
{"text":"So this restaurant was literally 10 steps from our hotel, outside appearance made me hesitant on giving this place a try and the reviews were ok.  They say never judge a book by its cover because inside was totally different, very modern. They have two sides to the restaurant, one side is where you can sit for Tepanakki, and the other side is for just sushi. We just wanted sushi, but oh boy! Did I over order. we ordered the sashimi salad, garlic tuna yaki which was amazing and I ordered the safari roll. That safari roll literally lived up to its name, it was a mixture of fish, it had a lot of things going on.  It was pretty good just it was just so overwhelming to look at. Our waiter Cory was very nice, he said it was his 3rd day so he couldn't recommend us anything, glad he was being honest. It was really hard to wave down anyone or our waiter at some points during the evening.  I even noticed the table across from us were getting annoyed.  They forgot to bring us plates for the sashimi salad appetizer, and extra utensil and napkins for our 3rd person.  They also didn't think about bringing us the small dishes for the soy sauce. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"We brought our son here for his 12th birthday a few weeks ago and again, sat on the teppanyaki side of the restaurant.  We had a reservation, so we got right in no problem.  He had a WONDERFUL time!  He said it was one of his best birthdays ever!  The waitress recommended a melon flavored Japanese soda to him and he loved it.  He thought that the giant birthday heads and the song played was great and even got up and danced (gotta love kids right?).    Food was awesome as well.  Our son had scallops, I had the terriyaki chicken, and my husband had the shrimp and scallops.  We were all very happy with our food freshness, how it was cooked, amount, etc.    Definitely going to be a birthday tradition, so much fun, staff is so friendly, food is great, and the price is comparable to other restaurants of this type.  Very happy!  I do however, recommend that you make a reservation as some folks that came in after us with no reservation were going to have to wait 45 minutes.  Very simple to do though and makes the wait 5 minutes at best."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The Mesa one that is. I went to this location for the first time this weekend and was disgusted on the customers actions (taking food and plates from our party), the service, and the fact that the cook picked up food he dropped on the table and onto my husbands plate. There was no apology from the cook for what he did and no refund. I called to complain about our experience and the manager said that I needed to come to Peoria to have a credit put back on my card for the amount we were charged. I said, I am not coming all the way back out there for you to put a credit on my card. Then he got smart with me and said, \"what do you want me to do? Bring the machine to you in Mesa and use the card there\"? I called him out on that. I also asked the manager for the owners name so I can make a call for myself. I will NEVER go back to this location again. The one is Mesa is much cleaner, friendlier and much more fun!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the first time, Levi was our waiter/bartender. The food, service and price was honestly the best service I've ever had. We appreciated the hospitality and sense of humor that Levi had gone above and beyond to help us celebrate our farewell dinner. I highly recommend this place to everybody who is in the area. I personally drive quite the way and it was well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna start off first that I haven't been here for the teppanyaki yet. I usually come for happy hour which is amazing. I mean you can get three rolls and an appetizer which would be good for two ppl for under 15$. Plus if you come on a Tuesday they have 1$ sake and they r actually pretty good I would recommend the cucumber one. The service is always good and the place has a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Yesterday I took my daughters and a couple of their friends here for lunch. The kids were super excited. The children were 11 and younger. When we sat down we ordered our drinks  3 sushi rolls and then 3 kids steak meals and I ordered steak and scallops. She asked how old the girls were, and when I said the 1 was 11. She REFUSED to let her order off the kids meal. She said it is only for 10 and under. I looked All Over their menu and the kids menu and no age was written. I told her that she is not getting an adult meal because she got sushi also and she was having the kids meal and that was that.  She left brought our drinks and I thought all was good. She then has the manager come out and say that they will not allow her to order off the kids menu because she is 11. I explained to her that she was either going to allow her to order it or we were leaving. She refused, so we got up and left. We went to RYU on Val Vista and Williams Field, which is where we usually go, had an amazing lunch! I am appalled at a place that would refuse to let a child order off of a kids menu. I have worked in restaurants for YEARS and this would have been unacceptable.  If they are going to be this much of a stickler about the age of their kids menu-MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT THE AGE ON THE MENU. Don't wait for a child to order, then ask their age, then refuse to let them get it."}
{"text":"I came here to try their sushi for the first time (and will probably be the last time). The sushi and the service was below average. When we first arrived, it took the waiter a long time to come over. When we finally ordered our drinks, it was not brought over until I asked the waiter. When he went to check it, he found out that they did not have the ingredient to make the drink that I ordered. At that point, I really didn't want to order anything else. If you at a sushi lover, I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the time to go.  The prices and sushi are very reasonable.  Moving to Arizona, I wasn't sure how the sushi would compare to LA, but I have to say I don't see a noticeable difference. I am looking forward to visiting this place again and indulging my love of seafood!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and it was a great choice! The interior is very nice, don't let the exterior fool you! We sat at the teppan grill and the food was fantastic. I had the salmon which came with the usual shrimp,  fried rice, veggies, miso soup, and salad. The chef got me pretty tipsy by pouring sake into my mouth throughout the whole cooking adventure lol. They even sang happy birthday and made me wear a mask. It was a really fun time and the food was so good. I would highly recommend coming here!"}
