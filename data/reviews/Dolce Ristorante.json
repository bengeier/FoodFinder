{"text":"We didn't have the best experience here. The food was really expensive for the quality and flavors were one-note across the board. We shared sausage mushrooms, and the taste was inconsistent since one 'shroom would be salty, the next sweet, except it wasn't purposeful--it just wasn't mixed well before baking. My shrimp and pasta entree felt more like Applebee's than an $18 plate. The taste was okay and portions were super-sized, but there was no nuance and it just wasn't that great. My partner's was equally bleh. Not terrible food, just ridiculously overpriced. And oh, goodness gracious, the Celine-Dion-esque Italian music was cheesier than the pasta sauce."}
{"text":"I'd eaten at Dolce 3-4 years ago and found it mediocre.  Some friends had recently gone and enjoyed themselves and I really wanted to like the restaurant.  To some degree I was successful.  Here are some pro's and con's.

Pros:
1) The waiters were friendly and helpful. 

2)  The wine list is a good size and reasonably priced.  My waiter knew the list well and could make intelligent and helpful recommendations.

3)  Even though it's in a strip mall, I enjoyed the outdoor seating; I just pretended that the parking lot was a beach on the Riveria.

4)  The beans/tomatoes that came with the bread were outstanding.  Fresh and good tomatoes along with a good prep made for an enjoyable introduction.  the olive oil in which to dip one's bread was of good quality.

5)  The mista salad had really good cherry tomatoes and, yes, tasty cucumbers.

Cons (or near cons):

1)  The greeting staff met me with a frown and the question \"What can I get you?\"  Well, maybe dinner.  How about \"Welcome to Dolce.\" etc. along with a smile.

2)  The bread was ordinary (not much flavor and not overwhelmingly fresh).  

3)  My mista salad was a bit limp. The \"balsamic dressing\" consisted of a bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  

4)  My veal (saltimbucca) , well, was OK, but nothing to write home about.  It was beaten successfully into tenderness, but the proscuitto was sparse, soft, and soaked in a wine sauce. It didn't taste like parma.  The vegetable side didn't do much for me; it sorta just sat there and said \"I'm ordinary over-cooked vegetables -- but not bad.\"

5)  Some of the desserts are made in house and some are purchased.  I was full and didn't try them so no comment here.

6)  For reasons beyond me the dinner menu on their attractive website reads \"09 fall/winter.\"  It's still about the same menu as 3 years ago, but I think the web site's alternating attractiveness and huh?-ness reflects the rest of my dining experience.

As chef Rocco DiSpirito replied in his old TV show \"The Restaurant\" to someone who wasn't wild about his food: \"It's fun food, not fine food.\"   Same here.

Go with limited expectations and you'll have a delightful time.

P.S. a note to reviewer  Kathleen T (7/13/10) who went to lunch alone and felt that the servers were shocked that she was there alone and was stuck at a bad table.  I went to dinner by myself and was greeted by three staff in a row who began with \"Is it just you?\"  I did get a good table (sorry Kathleen), but wished they had started with a \"Will you be joining us for dinner tonight?  Are there more in your party?\" or something like that.  It wasn't a big thing, but it's so easy to fix."}
{"text":"I was here Tuesdays when they have their house made gnocchi - I think it's delicious 
I tried it with 4 cheese sauce - not to much sauce and a nice size of soft melting gnocchi
Also the waiter was very nice and did a good job. I used a groupon, which also was no problem at all."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Italian food. Portions are small and prices are high. I had the eggplant (2 rolled pieces with ricotta & mozzarella) and a scoop of risotto) which was very good. My husband had the spaghetti bolonese which he enjoyed. We ended with coffee which was very strong but good."}
{"text":"Dolce is not a sweet dining experience.
The restaurant is crowded with too many tables in the for the square footage..
Service was slow and inattentive.
The entrée was returned because it was too salty, no alternative was offered. 
Obviously a poorly managed establishment.

Save yourself the frustration and visit other Italian restaurants in the area.  Here's a link to the top 10 (notice Dolce is not one of them): http://www.10best.com/destinations/north-carolina/charlotte/restaurants/italian/"}
{"text":"I have passed this place on multiple occasions and based on the strip mall appearance would never have stopped.  We were invited by friends and I am so glad!  This place is an absolute gem.  Inside is cozy and warm.  Great for dining with friends or for a romantic date.  I ordered the shrimp and spicy tomato sauce with black linguine.  The pasta is freshly made and squid ink used to dye the pasta.  It gives a nice subtle salty taste.  I also had a taste of the gnocchi dish that is carried on the menu and it was fabolous.  The texture was just right- not dry or overly chewy.  I could have eaten the whole plate.  We got the toll house pie and it was also amazing.  For two meals, dessert, one glass of wine, and a couple of beers our bill was under $50.  For the amount and quality of food, I felt it was a fantastic value. I will be back."}
{"text":"Tuesdays never seemed special until I was introduced to Dolce's Tuesday-night-gnocchi special. Each bite of the four-cheese gnocchi (my personal favorite), is like tasting soft pillows of heavenly goodness. There's other flavors too (pesto, bolognese, butter sage...) but for the lactose lovers, the four-cheese can't be beat!

Four varieties of cheese might be enough for a single course, but certainly not for the entire dinner. I have to end the evening with indulging in their strawberry cheesecake. To justify ordering, I usually pretend to share. Or just order the delicious Fresca Salad to feel healthy.... Oh god, there's gorgonzola on that too. 

It's all worth it!!"}
{"text":"We've driven/walked by this place a thousand times since it's only 2 blocks from us and always said we should go sometime.  But that time never came...until our old friend the Groupon showed up one magical day.  So we finally had a reason to go and after going our only regret is not discovering this place sooner.  

It's a relatively small, cozy place inside (too cold for outside when we went) which I think is what you want for a more upscale italian place.  Our waiter was great and really helped explain the dishes and provide some excellent suggestions.  The wine and beer were great.  The food was fantastic.  We ordered an appetizer they had on special...don't remember the name but it was like soft mozzarella wrapped in other mozzarella...phenomenal.  For entrees we got the vodka penne with chicken and the gnocci (we unknowingly went on gnocchi night) which were both great.  But again me being a dessert traditionalist I was a little let down by the cheesecake.  They do theirs with mascarpone...so I figure well I like mascarpone and I like cheesecake...lets put those babies together.  But alas all I truly wanted was NY style cheesecake.  But really I'm nitpicking at this point.  This place is great.

We give it 4.5 dolce's out of 5"}
{"text":"Not worth the money, even with a Living Social. Disappointing. Food tasted frozen and canned. Better off at Olive Garden. In desperate need of a visit from Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to restaurants for a casual weeknight dinner. The service is always friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is casual but intimate. 

Upon being seated, a bread basket with bean salad is presented and is the only consistently disappointing  part of the experience. For an Italian restaurant, we have expectations of fresh, warm, crusty bread and theirs is definitely the opposite in every way.

Besides the bread, everything else is always wonderful. For a small restaurant, they have a delightful Italian wine selection to compliment their dishes. The vodka sauce is the best in Charlotte--ask if they have any fresh pastas available to pair it with, typically they have something in the back. Gnocchi night is also impressive, with fluffy and delicate gnocchi accompanied by delicious sauces and proteins that are typically aligned to the seasons. 

We highly recommend this spot, but wouldn't consider it the best Italian in the area for a date or special occasion--just a tasty staple that is well-priced!"}
{"text":"Big fan of their gnocchi. Always pleasant service and food comes out relatively quickly. They have a small restaurant, tables are pretty close together but it gives that small Italian cafe feel. Love that they have a covered patio with heaters so you can enjoy sitting outside rain or shine."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Dolce for the Restaurant week a few months ago. The food was fantastic, service was great, it was very clean and cost effective. If you're looking for some authentic Italian, this is the place! Can't wait to see the new renovations."}
{"text":"A pleasant waitress, nice plating, reasonable pricing but surprisingly uninspired flavors. Ambiance within restaurant is nice, but surrounded by full-view, busy, garishly-lit shopping center parking lot. Staff and management a little insensitive to the dining experience. They just don't seem to be trying very hard for excellence. Although we've been in years past, this was our third attempt in recent months, being turned away at 9:30P on two separate weekend nights because of limited hours. Too many better choices nearby to bother with Dolce again. Luisa is frankly better at the pizza business."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm typing as I'm eating. This place blew my mind. It succeeded my expectations. I liked everything we tried; however, the stars of the night were the caprese  appetizer and the veal piccata. Best Italian restaurant in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Dolce is one of those places that feels authentic Italian to those of us who perhaps don't have a lot of truly authentic places to compare.  I've been three times and always enjoyed the food and had good experiences.  The service is excellent.  I've gotten the same waiter on three visits and he goes through the menu and handles all his service bilingually, which is a nice touch for my taste.  They have a nice menu, good variety, but not so many choices you are overwhelmed.  They have a good wine selection as well as traditional Italian coffee options to accompany their dessert menu.  

The location is in a strip mall but they have expanded out onto the side walk for year-round outdoor seating.

Also, they make homemade gnocchi on Tuesdays - could be a gimmick, but a place that only makes a dish once a week gets my attention.

Overall this is a great place to take a date for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Dolce since 2006. We're Italian American new yorkers who bought a second home in South Carolina. We were so happy when we found a really good Italian restaurant, especially with such a sweet owner like Louisa. We eat in Manhattan almost every week and I can say that Louisa's food is comparable to any of the really good restaurants in New York. We particularly like fungi as an appetizer,amatriciana with bucatini, incredible gnocchi on Tuesday, chicken franchese, and veal marsala. Deserts are very good, especially the lemon cheese cake and the gelato. We go to the Carolina's about seven times a year and always make a stop at Dolce."}
{"text":"I received a $50 Groupon from a friend for this place and I was hoping for it to be good but I feel like if we hadn't had the Groupon, I wouldn't have eaten here since the prices were high and the food wasn't that great. I most likely won't eat here again."}
{"text":"I went to Dolce last night with two Italian guys; my husband and his friend.  I've had Italian food cooked by both of their mothers so I knew they could put Dolce to the test.  Dolce delivered as promised by all the other good reviews.

We all ordered specials.  Starting with the appetizer special.  I don't remember the name but it was thin layers of Italian meats, cheeses, olives etc between thin sheets of dough.  I've never had anything like it.  It delivered a great mix of flavor and adventure in every bite.  

Next up, Lobster ravioli for me and and Osso Bucco for them.  Italian comfort food as they called it.  Everything was delicious.   To top it off we had espresso and  almond gelato which came as quite a generous portion and just the perfect hint of flavor to keep you reaching for another bite.  

I was able to get 7:00 PM reservations at around noon of the same day but the place filled up fast after that so I do recommend reservations."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to be writing this review. I have been going to dolce for 8 years now - I love their food, but service has been going downhill and my experience tonight made me want to share a review. 

First things first - the food - was very good, per usual. I got the fresca salad and the pollo al limone. My husband got the frutti di mare, a spicy seafood linguine with red sauce. His was better, nice amount of heat and excellent fresh pasta.

Now, the negative. Service was really poor tonight - the restaurant was 1/3 full when we arrived at 7pm and we were seated at a 2-top in a middle row. I asked to be moved out of the middle, as there were 5 open tables, all for 2 people right near us, not in the middle where we'd be bumped and squeezed. the hostess went to ask, and I could hear Luisa(the owner) yelling at her that we had no choice but to sit there, they were full. We did have a reservation, so it wasn't like they were squeezing us in. For the rest of our hour and 15 minute dinner, 3 of the open tables I requested remained empty.

Ok, so I didn't like my table. Not the biggest deal. But then.... The server. No water refills, no offer for wine refills, and he didn't want to recommend anything, even if asked. I had an empty salad plate and empty water glass for 10 minutes and he walked by empty handed at least 5 times and didn't pick anything up or refill my water. I used to wait tables and I understand being busy or in the weeds, but this wasn't the case. He seemed to think that picking up dishes or refilling waters wasn't his job, so he didn't do it. 

But then... Still with empty tables around us, Luisa (the owner) walks by, stops next to our table and starts yelling into the kitchen about seating and wine. And I mean yelling - we had to stop our conversation because she was standing over my head. 

So, food was good, my company was excellent and we made the best of it. I must recommend take out, or trying another place if you're looking for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Went here late Tuesday for wine with a friend after the People's Pharmacy lecture @ Cov Pres. The Malbec was the best I've ever had and the gnocci was addictive. Not served with enough sauce, but waiter brought more upon request. Very pricey."}
{"text":"This is once of my favorite restaurants.  They have such a mom and pop feel that you just love the staff and can tell that they enjoy what they're doing.

The food here is great!!  After visiting too many times to count, I've yet to experience disappointment.  The specials are usually a great treat as well.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for great, authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Always a favorite for work lunch or romantic dinner. Try the tonno salad at lunch or tilapia at dinner. Always a fabulous meal. The tireless owner, Luisa, cares greatly about each person dining there."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Dolce. Upon arrival, we had to wait a few minutes before we were acknowledged though not a big deal as we could see that they were extremely busy. While we were waiting at the front desk, I overheard who the lady, was sorting out someones payment, saying \"this better not be a groupon thing - grrrrr\". 

Our waiter was extremely pleasant and patient while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive. He was also very knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu. The menu is quite different from other Italian restaurants we've been to - plenty of exciting dishes even for vegetarians... or so I thought until the waiter pointed out that almost all the dishes are cooked with chicken stock so VEGETARIANS BE AWARE of this. He said he'd ask the chefs to cook the pasta in water but I couldn't have the risotto as it was cooked in chicken stock. I had the Rotolini which is eggplant stuffed with ricotta and my husband had the spaghetti. The portions are generous but we found the food over salted & hence couldn't finish our food because of this. The rest in our group said their food was excellent and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal. 

I think this place is over priced and over crowded; my husband and I would have enjoyed the food if it wasn't over-salted. We may try it again, this time with a groupon coupon....let's see if we have a better dining experience then."}
{"text":"Poor service, cold food...and did I say, poor service? There are too many food options in Charlotte, so good luck Dolce and buyer beware."}
{"text":"The service here is downright appalling. We made a reservation a week in advance and upon arriving a few minutes before our scheduled time they did not have our reservation down. We told them when we had called and even showed them in our phone. The owner said they just did not have it and there was nothing they could do even though it was their mistake. No offer of a discount or to squeeze us into the back to make up for losing our reservation. They offered to sit us outside in the humid 95 degree weather. They were rude and should really be ashamed. I could tell the waitress looked apologetic but the owner could care less. Hope the food makes up for the horrific service but due to how we were treated and how hot it was outside we did not stick around to find out."}
{"text":"Just ok. This place isn't bad just not great. I ordered rolled eggplant which was pretty good as was the sauce but there wasnt enough of it and had to ask for more. The menu said it came with the starch of the day and vegetable of the day. So I got eggplant with tomato sauce and...mashed potatoes? Really? who does that? When I inquired about it I was told we are a NORTHERN Italian rsetaurant...condescending ( and, yeah, I've been to Northern Italy and know the difference). I was then told they were \"Parmesan Whipped Potatoes\" ...I tasted them.... pretty much mashed potato witout a hint of parmesan.  I was told I could get a side of spaghetti for $3. It can't cost more than 50 cents to make that.....almost $20 for that meal is not a good value. To be fair my wife had a salmon dish that was more generous and very good."}
{"text":"Service from waiter was okay if this was Olive Garden. In fact, food was about equal to Olive Garden. Even with Groupon we paid way too much for food that we didn't even finish. The hostess and her team were loud and unprofessional. The wine was sub-par and overpriced. We will never return. Go to Fiamma instead, it's amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last night and we were a little hesitant because of all the mixed reviews, but we we loved it!  The entrees were about 16 to 25$ and generous portions.  My boyfriend had the lamb and said the meat was falling off the bone.  I had the eggplant and it was amazing.  The service was great to!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went there a few nights ago and we were very impressed.
We chose to have the nightly specials.
 Butternut squash crepes with a fabulous  mushroom cream sauce &  mussels in spicy marinara sauce for appetizers.
Osso buco over saffron risotto  for my husband & for me, Tilapia topped with lump crab meat with a scallion cream sauce. Both so good. For dessert we chose the home made rum raisin gelato
topped with espresso coffee & whipped cream.
From the food to the excellent service Dolce is one of those place you want to go back again & again"}
{"text":"We arrived at approximately 8:15pm on a Saturday night and wanted to sit outside. The person greeting us proceeded to tell us that they had just closed the patio, due to a holiday weekend so that the staff could leave early.  We were concerned about keeping people, so we were ready to leave, when she adamantly stated that we could still be served.  I specifically told her that we did not want to keep them from closing early.  She insisted, and so we were seated inside.  Halfway through our meal, which was approximately 30 minutes, servers were blowing out candles on surrounding empty tables, and a sense of urgency upon our server and assistants, to clear and move us along was extremely evident.  Our entire table consisted of restaurant management and service industry individuals, and this was extremely annoying to all of us.  We requested a manager, and he arrived at our table without an introduction.  He offered an apology, told us to stay as long as we wanted, and walked away.  Really???  Work on your attention to customer service Dolce.  You may pay an admirable amount of attention to your pasta, but you have a lot to work on when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"We went to Dolce because we had a Groupon.  I enjoyed the \"bread and beans\" - very Italian.  Our appetizer was the stuffed mushrooms - very filling and good enough to be a main entree.  I had the Amatriciana and my boyfriend had the Bolognese.  Both were great and with generous portions.  Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert.  My two minor complaints were our wait for glasses of water and the distance between tables - conversations were very close.  
I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"My first time there, was hesitant about it being totally empty but it ended up being one the best Italian meals I've ever had. I only got the sorrento pasta and the clam pasta (I can't remember the name of it, but it was clams and linguini in a white wine butter sauce with parsley). Both were my favorite pasta dishes I've had in a long time. Not only is it a good price for the plate, it was more than delicious. 
Save room for dessert, the tiramisu was the best thing I've ever had. I didn't like tiramisu before this one and it was the most light and fluffy and NOT BITTER AT ALL tiramisu ever. 15/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and I can easily rate both experiences with 5 stars.  I love that most of the pasta is homemade.  My girlfriend ordered a pasta special and there was a ton of lobster in it - delicious!  The gnoccihi dish is outstanding as well.  The portions are more than enough, and our servers on both occasions were personable, attentive and knew the wine list well enough to make recommendations.  Based on our experiences thus far, I can easily rank Dolce as one of my top three favorite Italian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this restaurant has such high ratings. Tried it last week because of a Living Social deal. I got the ravioli with chicken; girlfriend got the spaghetti with shrimp. I couldn't finish my meal because it was so insanely salty. I went through five glasses of water trying to choke down the food, and in the end I had to just stop even though I was still hungry. I tried the spaghetti, and it was just as salty. When I told the waiter to bring extra water because the food is way too salty, he responded with, \"I knoooow,\" so I don't think this was news to him.  

Some other peculiarities:  
- The decor is beyond awful. It feels like you are sitting in a thrift shop with tables.  
- No beer or cocktails. Just wine.  
- The menu is very limited.  
- Really odd: The entree list (as opposed to the pasta list) says, \"All entrees are served with the starch of the day.\" I asked about the milanese, which is a very thin, breaded piece of chicken. It doesn't come with a starch (risotto that day) because it comes with lettuce instead. So for $23, you get a thin piece of chicken and some lettuce. What the..  
- Even though I was clearly trying to complain to the waiter that the food was almost inedible, there was no hint that anything was going to be done about it. He could not have cared less.  

I'm sorry to dump on a restaurant this harshly, but really, the food is just garbage, and the prices they charge are obscene considering all of the terrible factors. If you want to charge $20 for a plate of noodles, you need to be much better than a Walmart atmosphere with salt standing in for flavor."}
{"text":"This is the BEST authentic Italian food in Charlotte. The new owner is so nice and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Husband and I usually tend to be pretty budget-conscious, even when we're treating ourselves to a meal out. So, Dolce wouldn't have made it onto our usual radar without the help of a group coupon deal. I'm really glad it did!

The ambiance of the place is sweet, and I imagine might have an even more intimate feel after dark - tables are snug, with candles on all of them, but as we dined fairly early to skip the crowds, it was too light to have need of them.

Our waiter, Matt, seemed pretty knowledgeable of both the food and wine menus. I was having trouble deciding between a few dishes, but was able to narrow down based on his recommendation, plus he helped Husband find a great wine pairing for his dish (and one that he wouldn't have picked on his own). Service was always very prompt and he made sure we were taken care of from start to finish.

After we ordered, a basket of bread (white italian bread, sliced, room-temperature; nothing terribly special) and dish of marinated white beans, tomatoes, onions and herbs was set out to stave off our hunger until the mains arrived. If they could work on a better bread offering, this freebie app would be off the charts!

Surprisingly quickly after that, our entrees appeared - I went with the pasta Amatriciana (rigatoni with spicy red sauce featuring sauteed shallots and pancetta - $16.95) and added shrimp (+$3); Husband ordered the veal Marsala ($19.95), which sides of the day featured green beans and risotto. 

My pasta was pretty damn delicious. No, the pasta didn't taste like it was made in house, but it *was* high quality, and cooked appropriately al dente, AND well sauced - not too much, not too little, well-coated on each noodle, *without* a big saucy puddle in the middle. I honestly wasn't expecting to be super impressed, but after my first bite, I was hooked! The shrimp was large, fresh and perfectly cooked, and the sauce super-flavorful. The portion size was appropriate for one person with possible leftovers, depending on how hungry that person was - but there certainly wasn't the overabundance you can get with some \"italian\" chains who give you a 1lb box per plate. The sauce was quite a bit richer than I expected, likely due to the pancetta, but it was worth every tasty morsel. Other diners I passed in the restaurant had some SERIOUSLY tasty-looking fettuccine dishes that I'd love to try on another visit. 

Husband's dinner was similarly delicious, but larger in portion. I joked that next time we ate there, we should just order what he got and split it - but that's not really a joke! His dish included two huge flat-pounded veal filets that were positively smothered in mushrooms and big pieces of prosciutto, along with good-sized servings of green beans (I didn't catch the details of how they were prepared...it seemed like they may have been sauteed with some sort of tomato sauce + bacon?) and risotto. After he'd eaten his fill (and shared a lot of mushrooms and green beans with me) there was still a ton of food left on the plate. We couldn't even bear to think of making room for dessert. 

Another Yelper mentioned that upon paying with a group coupon, the bill came back with an automatic gratuity added in. That was not the case for us, though I wouldn't necessarily have minded if it did, since I understand how businesses - and servers - are sometimes at risk of being stiffed by folks who forget to tip based on their total bill.

Our meal was definitely worth more than what we paid for it, and good enough that we'd consider returning to Dolce. For our particular wallet limits, though, it would probably have to wait for a special occasion, or for another great coupon deal to roll around. Or maybe we can just get the in-laws to spring for supper next time they visit... ;)"}
{"text":"We have not tried everything on Dolce's menu, but we intend to.  I have never been more satisfied with food, service and price than I have the two times I've been to Dolce with my boyfriend.  Try the mushroom appetizer, it's incredible...and if you're not trying to spend a lot or if you don't want to induce a food coma (which is fine if you do) then split an entree, more than enough for two people.  No one leaves Dolce without the feeling of simplicity, and more importantly, quality."}
{"text":"Perhaps I would have a more positive review for Dolce if I had had the other server, Izzy, who was charming the tables around me. My server was SHOCKED and APPALLED that I was eating lunch alone, and he sat me in a narrow doorway (I banged my elbow into the wall twice because it was such a tight fit), even though there were a dozen other open tables. The mussels were overcooked. The panini had literally one see-through shaving of prosciutto (I had to pick up the bread to make sure it was there since I couldn't taste it) and it had limp lettuce pressed into the hot sandwich. Store-bought bread was brought cold to the table and was used in the panini. A huge disappointment considering all the other positive reviews."}
{"text":"The after affects of eating the food here, are just not worth it!!

My roommate and I are both in stomach pain, bloated and feel yucky. 

We ate here once before, and had a similar experience, but thought we'd give it another chance, to make sure it wasn't coincidence. It's too bad it's not going to be our go to restaurant, because the taste of the pasta was awesome! 

Our order:

The bread was dry, and the beans just weren't for us. 

My friend got the Alfredo pink sauce with penne pasta and I got the Cognac base sauce with penne pasta."}
{"text":"Apparently this little gem has been around for a while, but was just recently been brought to my attention.  This is an authentic Italian place, and when I say authentic I mean it.  They don't even have non-Italian beer.  
Anyway, it seems Dolce started out as a simple gelato shop that has since ballooned into a full blown restaurant.  The food was really good real Italian stuff, but the real winner was dessert.  Of course with their reputation for gelato there was a lot to be expected, and they did not disappoint.  Also the chocolate mousse brought about pleasurable sensations I believe only other chocoholic women would understand.  Have fun out there guys."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!! Lovely atmosphere and great service well. We both ordered the specials. I had the Pasta with mushrooms and ham in a Gorgonzola cream sauce. My daughter had the Chicken Francese. They were both fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I have been for lunch more times than I can count!! Dinner only like 3 times but never had I been on there Tuesday night Gnocchi Night!! Well I had my sister bring it home for me one night and it was just fabulous!!! How have I missed out on this for sooo long!! Homemade obviously with a nice bolognese it was perfect!!! They serve it with other sauces that was just the one I was feeling the most!! They always have great soups and even they're Spaghetti in a plain tomato sauce is good!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner at Dolce with family this evening. The place has long been a favorite and I was a bit skeptical when I heard they were under new management. I should is not have been. The service was on pointe and the food was the best it has ever been. The new owner was warm and clearly excited by what the future holds for this cozy neighborhood spot. I am too. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing dinner, authentic Italian. The owner that took over almost a year ago has really made this place fantastic. Check out this picture of dessert."}
{"text":"The food was average at best and the service was horrible. Our waiter acted like we were putting him out. He was very unpleasant even though our table of 6 had 2 bottles of wine and spent over $200. Unfortunately for us, this restaurant automatically adds a 20% gratuity for a six top which is ridiculous in and of itself, let alone the waiter did not deserve it. 

If you are looking for over-priced, so-so Italian food and rude wait staff, search no further."}
{"text":"Food and service were ok. But it is overpriced, spotty service, the \"patio\" where they stuck us is basically a tent in the parking lot, no salad included, smallish menu with no pizza. If you are thinking of going here, don't. Just go to Mama Ricottas."}
{"text":"If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.  My wife and I had the three course meal during restaurant week.  Every course was amazing.  Starters burrata y procuitto and the Dolce salad,  mains parpadelli bolognese and the gnocchi in tomato cream and for dessert the marscapone cheese cake and lemoncello cake.  From start to finish the meal and service was outstanding.  The owner is really hands on making sure everything is spot on.  Will definitely be back to try the expanded menu they offer not during restaurant week."}
{"text":"Gnocchi, gnocchi, gnocchi. This is the only reason we go! They have, hands down, the best gnocchi in Charlotte - it's just unfortunate that it's only available on Tuesdays! (And occasionally another night, as a special). Soft, pillowy, heavenly, just right - little clouds that melt in your mouth! The hostess is sweet, and always very attentive! The beans they serve to go with their bread are delicious - I eat them plain, even when the bread is gone! They have more of a northern italian menu, so not as much pasta as you would expect, but if you're there on Tuesday, you can never go wrong with the gnocchi."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous and the service was amazing! I had the stuffed grouper and the chocolate tort; and I loved every minute of it. I also appreciated that the owner moved us to a better table, which was more quiet and created a better date night experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. We were greeted with friendly smiles and were made to feel at home.  The space is quaint; an at home feeling.  Tables are close together and during the dinner hours it got pretty loud.

All of the food ordered was prepared very well.  All others had salads that were ample in size for the price.  I had the sausage and cheese filled mushrooms with a pink cream sauce.  It was juicy and very flavorful.

I had the night's special: panko crusted NC trout topped with crab meat and scallion cream.  Very rich, moist and full of flavors. A friend had the pasta du jour which was enough for two people.   No complaints from him.  My wife enjoyed the cheese filled eggplant roulades too.

The dessert selection is ample and homemade. The cheesecake was light; I had a slice of the lemoncelllo cake.  Light yellow cake with the freshness of lemons.  The icing was complementary and not over sweet.

The experience would have been perfect if our table wasn't in the corner by the wait/bus station.  We heard empty bottles being thrown into the garbage all night. Plus the staff kept cutting through with food. Guess it was like getting the table by the kitchen door! 

I would return but it is not a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"I actually just left the restaurant. Me and three of my friends all went to the restaurant for the first time. It was tiny and very cramped. I actually got elbowed in the head twice by servers. It was also extremely loud! I ordered a ceasar salad. I get the bill and its 16.95 for a salad and water!!! The menu specifically says 6.95. But somehow I'm getting charged 10 dollars extra! So I bring it up and ask why I'm getting charged so much. Apparently I got served a \"DINNER\" salad even though I ordered a regular salad. I told the server this as well as an older lady, short, redish curly hair, accent, very rude that I was over charged. The server failed to ask and tell me that I was getting a dinner portion even though the menu says NOWHERE that that it what you will get no matter what. The older lady told me that its dinner time so that is what I get. I went on to tell her that that is not what I ordered and that the menu says ceasar salad 6.95. She began talking in circles saying everything over and over again. She blamed everything on the server who was nice just failed to tell me. She also told me that it was my fault because I ate the salad. Yes, really. She told me it was my fault. She said that I did not complain so it's my problem. She also said \"You know what, your right mammi. It is my fault because this is not McDonald's and that is where you should be eating.\" Yep. She actually said that to a customer. I told the waiter that it was not his fault and told her that I would never be eating there again. I never will. I ended up paying 20 dollars for a salad, and to be honest, not a very good one. I'm still fuming at the fact that someone actually said that to me. It's not about the money, it's about what I ordered and what I was sneakily being charged for and when I asked about it I got yelled at. Classy"}
{"text":"This is an above average Italian spot with fair service and mediocre decor. The menu is standard. Dolce could use additional specials and menu updates especially in the seafood area. The restaurant is a solid if staid dining choice for Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Tuesday night because that's when they have gnocchi. 2nd time for my husband and me. 
Ok wine selection...my man the vino expert chose a mostly-Sangiovese blend that went well with our meal. About what you'd expert, price wise. 
Of course we ordered gnocchi! Paul our waiter was helpful in suggesting what sauce to choose. I had the special style with lobster claw meat, spinach, and tomato cream sauce. VERY tasty and mondo flavorful. Lots of lobster and kinda scant on the spinach, oddly. My husband had the pesto which was classic and well done. When I make it I go crazy with the garlic so other pesto always seems a bit to tame to me :)
No apps his time but the cannellini bean/tomato/garlic stuff that came with the bread was delicious. 
The only slightly bad part of the evening was the faint smell of paint in the dining room - it had been painted recently (and not too well considering the drips we saw - oops!)
I like this place. We'll go again. Try the gnocchi!"}
{"text":"First and last visit. YOU CANNOT PAY ME TO GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. We made Saturday night  9:15 PM reservations on open table. The last reservation was at 9:30pm. As soon as we walked in, the owner says to our server (right in front of us) to get the order quickly since the kitchen wants to close. Seriously? Excuse me for imposing. The worst thing that he could have done for his business tonight was to be that RUDE to an Italian. This rude, arrogant, obnoxious business owner destroyed the first and last impression that we will have of this place. I can assure you that we will share this story with all of our friends and never recommend this restaurant. He is an embarrassment to the Italian community."}
{"text":"I was attracted to this places based on the sign outside that said it was voted best Italian place in Charlotte. However, I can say it was anything but that. Even though the food wasn't bad (not good) it was extremely over priced and not worth the value. Also they only serve gnocchi on TUESDAY'S which really sucked."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, the food was good(even with a limited menu), however this establishment is in need of proper management.  When we expressed our concern regarding how we were being rushed through dinner on a Saturday night--the staff was ready for their long weekend off -- the manager seemed unconcerned, and quite unprofessional. Bad customer service trumps good food every time. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon.   Pricey but I believe everything is made fresh.   I asked for a sample of the Vodka sauce and they said they could not because chef makes to order.   Food is REALLY GOOD.  I think it is worth the price especially if you get a Groupon."}
{"text":"In what world are these prices justified? It's In the back of a strip mall and had cheap fake Italian decor. I went with a Groupon, because that was the only way this place would be worth it. Noodles and sauce = $18. Literally. Pasta/Entrees DON'T come with a starter salad or soup, another example of $20 spaghetti not being justified. Dishes are nothing extraordinary and I will not be returning unfortunately."}
{"text":"Best Gnocchi I've ever had. Soft pillows of love. Italian Cheesecake straight from the old country cookbook.  Incredible atmosphere.  Excellent hospitality. That's Amore!"}
{"text":"Best seafood pasta I have ever had. Pasta cooked perfectly as well as the sea food. The bread was yummy and the owner even gave us free shots after our meal. It was the best date night I have had in years. THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! We've had the lamb, the tilapia, the lobster, the tuna ( it's not on the menu now but they've honored my request before), and most of the desserts. I've always been pleased with the food and service at Dolce."}
{"text":"Draw a line through reviews from 2016 and back.  They don't matter anymore.  Why?  The new owners are crushing it.  From the new decor to the warm welcome we felt right at home (well, if I lived in Rome).

We began with a complimentary cannolloni bean and bread plate.  Soft and expertly seasoned, the beans enhanced the rustic bread with its crunchy crust.  Wonderful start.

The Funghi appetizer we selected are button mushrooms stuffed with spinach and cream cheese served in a cognac cream sauce.  The combination of el dente mushrooms, the slight ooze of the cream cheese, and the richness of the sauce coalesced into a memorable first course.

Lori ordered the ravioli stuffed with seafood.  Cooked perfectly it was the star entrée of the evening for our party.  My plate of pappardelle with a wild boar ragu held its own, but after tasting the ravioli I regretted my decision.  Nothing was amiss . . . but, that ravioli.  Mmm.  I guess you'll have to try it for yourself.

We received excellent service but we had to request a waitress after being seated for some time.  Once we ordered, and because it was restaurant week with the kitchen focused on an abbreviated menu, we felt the plates came out too fast.  

Somewhere in between these extremes lurks their fifth star.  I'll return to help them find it, too.  In the meantime, a hearty \"Give 'em a whirl\" from me."}
{"text":"While there wasn't anything terrible about my dinner here, there wasn't anything terribly memorable either. I went for a date with my boyfriend on a Monday night after purchasing a Groupon. I enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and my rotolini, and my boyfriend liked his veal. But nothing jumped out at us as amazing. Over all, we were very glad to have purchased the groupon, because otherwise we would have been very unhappy to pay the seriously over-priced bill. The service was about the same as the food....not terrible, but lackluster."}
{"text":"I went in on a Tuesday night, the only night Dolce makes their gnocchi due to the \"intense labor\" they said that goes into making it.  I started with the spinach salad that only had sparse appointments of the roasted beets, bacon, goat cheese, and pistachios.  The balsamic vinaigrette was far too syrupy sweet.  Onto the highly anticipated gnocchi......expecting a culinary delight, I was greatly disappointed with the quality - too soft and over cooked.  With a variety of sauces to choose from, I chose the bolognese sauce, again with disappointing results.  Expecting a rich, hearty, slow braised meat, veal & pork and vegetable sauce, typical of a bolognese sauce, theirs was sparse with meat and lacked any resemblance of vegetables.  It was more like a vodka cream sauce.  This was the third of three gnocchi dishes I had in Charlotte over the past 10 days and by far the worst of the three.   Since I dined alone to use my soon to expire dining coupon and they would not let me take any item home, I also ordered the Solgiola, a dish described as a \"rolled filet filled with lobster, shrimp & crab meat and baked & served with a creamy cognac sauce.\"  It came out slightly overcooked with a fishy taste, again causing concerns of quality.  The creamy cognac sauce looked very similar to the bolognese sauce except that it lacked the sparse bits of meat.  The lobster, shrimp & crab meat was minced together into an unrecognizable form, far from my expectations of chunks and lumps of fresh seafood bursting from a flaky and delicate flounder filet.  Served with it was a unimaginative and flavorless medley of green & yellow squash and a dollop of bland risotto, that appeared to be placed there to fill up excess space on the plate.  At the recommendation of the server, I ordered the chocolate mousse.  The presentation was an awesome display of a fluffy tower of formed mousse, a thin, horizontal chocolate layer that created a landing zone for the whipped cream dollop and a wedge of a wafer cookie.  What it offered in presentation, it lacked in flavor.  My dining experience was quite disappointing with the flavors far underachieving their full potential.  The only saving grace was that I used a dining coupon and avoided paying full price.

The one star was given only for the presentation of the chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte. Incredible, authentic food and the staff works above and beyond to deliver a great customer experience. The pasta options are exceptional and definitely make sure to try the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Although the menu is limited at Dolce, the food is very good.  It is some of the more authentic Italian food in Charlotte.  Unlike most places, they make their sauce and their dough from scratch.  The sauce is not out of a can as it is at most Italian places in Charlotte.  I had the mista salad which not only was very fresh, but could have been a small meal.  I also had the sorrento pasta with shrimp and it was delicious.  There were five in our party, and everyone enjoyed their meals.  The service was also very good."}
{"text":"A great dinner on a cold night. We really enjoyed our meal. Very good service with a cozy atmosphere.  Prosciutto and burrata to start. Polpette and rigatoni al Amatrice.    finished with tiramisu."}
{"text":"A friend and I went into dolce for lunch with a groupon that was expired that had no stipulations about using the groupons at lunch or dinner. All my friend wanted to do was use her expired value. The manager told her she was to call groupon because it was their fault that they did not stipulate when the groupon was able to be used. The manager and the waiter were rude. I have worked in service industry for years and never had an experience where obviously is was the businesses fault and they would not accept fault.he manager also said because we did not show the groupon when we sat down. She was such a coward that she could not even have an adult conversation with us. The food was mediocre, but because of how rude they treat their customers I will not be going back. How do they expect to create an environment where people want to become regulars by being so rude. What happened to the customer is always right?"}
{"text":"The food was good but the portions were very small. It was extremely overpriced for the amount of food that we got."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with my husband after purchasing a Groupon some months before. We made reservations as the Groupon stated we should but honestly I don't think they would have been needed. The place was full but nothing over the top. The decor was not the worst I have seen but not exactly enjoyable/cozy. We were sat at an 'in between' sort of table and it was really uncomfortable the entire dinner and very very small. My next complaint would be about the service, pretty much everyone who worked here aside from the bus boy was not very friendly. Finally, the food was decent but very very overpriced for what you got. I had the penne with vodka sauce which was good but again nothing worth the cost. My husband had the shrimp linguine with cream sauce, he wasn't all that impressed. All in all we would not come back. Even after the Groupon (worth $40) the dinner was $60."}
{"text":"Went for my husband's birthday.  I would rate the attentiveness of the waiter at a C -/ Waited for a while before he even took our order. We had a special appetizer at 17.00 which the waiter never mentioned.  Although it was yummy not sure it was worth the price.  Both dinners were over salted.  My husband couldn't eat his, I took half home.   This use to be one of our favorite restaurants.  Not sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was visting Charlotte for Easter weekend.  My nieces, sister and I had a relaxing day planned.  Lunch first and then a facial.  Girls day out.  My niece had purchased a Living Social promotion with a value of $50.  Our bill amounted to 58$ and some change.  When we presented it to our server he came back with it and said he could not honor it.  We asked to speak to the owner.  An older Italian woman with red hair came out and told us that because there were 4 of us at the table that we could not use the coupon.    She told us that we should read the fine print.  My niece tried to explain why we thought the coupon was valid, but the owner would not hear any of it.  She walked away yelling at us.  The real shame is that the food was good, but that owner is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Food was amazon, service great too. A little pricy but worth it for a nice date night"}
{"text":"I am a Grubhub driver. I came to pick up an order for a customer. The restaurant was EXTREMELY late with producing the order. When I arrived the manager rudely told me to move out of the way! I understand that it was packed and that they were very busy, but it's NO reason to be rude and disrespectful. Instead of cussing him out like he deserves, I chose to write this ACCURATE review of my experience! I wouldn't recommend ANYONE support a business where they are extremely rude to their patrons."}
{"text":"I love me some Dolce.  I have been craving it for a while and today my sister and I were able to meet there for lunch.  I have yet to have something I don't like here.  I think my favorite is the eggplant rotolloni, or however they spell it, and a side of the spaghetti .  The vegetables they serve with entrees are so simple but so yummy, just roasted or sauteed in some olive oil, but so good.  The gnocchi is great but I never remember to come on a Tuesday for it.   The stuffed mushrooms and mussels are great.  Really I could just cut and paste their menu and endorse everything on it!!

Prices are very reasonable, service is good and depending on how busy they are you can be in and out in 30 minutes!!  A definite staple in my Charlotte restaurant repertoire."}
{"text":"Dolce = Scrumptious = extremely pleasing to the sense of taste
delectable, pleasant-tasting, yummy, toothsome, delicious, luscious
tasty - pleasing to the sense of taste; \"a tasty morsel\""}
{"text":"The food is delicious, just don't expect good service. The manager is always abrupt and rude. On my most recent visit, we were rudely seated at a middle table right by the entrance at 5pm on a weeknight even though the rest of the place was completely empty because as the manager explained, they had sent out an email to \"their regulars\" for some specials and were saving tables for them...an email which we received and planned to use."}
{"text":"Totally DEVOID of \"Italian\" 'tude!!!  \"Ken\" if that was his name? Might be the BEST Service Staff Person in Charlotte!!!  How smart can a person be!  My closest Friends (everyone knows) and co-workers (even my Wife) says I'm difficult to read, thus not so easy to wait on... This Man did a Fantastic  Job!  

On with the Food!  I know I'm weird!  First I order Water with no ice, seconds later Gelato as an appetizer... Here is where my Server began to show me he was paying close attention and started deciding how he would bring me what I wanted... Gelato : I could have Chocolate, Vanilla, BOTH or \"have you ever heard of Espresso Poured over a scoop of each\" (Actually my Wife ordered something similar when we were in Savannah just weeks ago) Sounds Good and it was!  Not sure if the Gelato was that good or if the Espresso Poured over it MADE it!  Glad I got it!  Great Appetizer!!!

Spaghetti Bolognese The Pasta tasted House-made (it was not) some of their Pasta is House made... The Sauce was good, not my favorite, still better than most Non Greek Italian!

Bread with (if you like)  Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar or (if you don't like) REAL Butter!

Tiramisu for Dessert (see the Photo) it was VERY Good!!!

All Service Staff were Polite, Friendly and Professional - Overheard them saying some kind words about some of the customers that had just left!"}
{"text":"Luisa, after eating in your restaurant since the day it opened, celebrating both of my children's birthdays yearly, tipping 25-40% every single time, sending friends, having showers and bringing clients...it all comes down to your rude daughter/manager. Our family has been loyal. We will miss Ken. He is awesome. We adored Petra and Carlos. Your daughter is rude and sucked at waiting tables because she has NO people skills and she sucks at managing. 

Since the day you opened as Dolce and not Dolce and Gelato we have ordered our children a side of pasta. Didn't know a \"kid's pasta\" existed. We have been charged $3. Last night when I was charged $7 for 25 penne noodles and a \"kid's pasta\" I said to the waitress \"I ordered 2 sides of pasta.\" 

Your daughter then proceeds to come outside and tell me \"someone has been doing me favors and she is going to fix this problem and I should never have been getting $3 side pastas for the kids.\" Excuse me. Favors? For my loyalty for 10+ years you accuse me of somehow stealing from you with \"someone doing me favors.\" 

Can you read your own menu that says a side of pasta with an entree is $3?

20 noodles with butter is not worth $7. Ask 300 East, a kid's pasta is larger AND cheaper.

Ken, we will miss you. Petra, if you ever head back from Raleigh with your beautiful daughter come see us.  Hayley, good luck in school!

Luisa, fire your daughter. She sucks. She always has. She just lost you a very loyal customer because in spite of \"someone doing me favors\" it was the other way around. I did you a favor by being a loyal patron and allowing your restaurant to be such an integral part of our lives.

And, I recommend your daughter go work at Chick-fil-A, like I did starting at 12. They can teach her how to treat a customer.

Luisa, wake up. Your daughter sucks at people skills. She is rude and couldn't wait a table. Put her in the kitchen so she doesn't ever have to see a patron or interact with anyone and tell her to throw in a few more noodles for $7.

And, then I will do you a favor and consider stepping foot back in your restaurant again. On second thought, no I won't. 

Maybe the reason why you always have to be on living social or groupon is her and her \"management.\"

Sincerely, Your once Loyal Customer"}
{"text":"I am no longer a resident of Charlotte but if I were this would be a regular stop for me.
My wife and I were in town visiting my family for the holidays. My mother had mentioned going here before but it had never worked out. The restaurant is located at the intersection of Kenilworth and East Blvd. Anyway, we finally made it and boy was it delicious. We had a 1 PM reservation so it wasn't very crowded when we arrived. Parking is somewhat of a problem as there are a number of businesses in this one area. Our waiter's name was Jeff and he was very attentive. We didn't order any drinks just our meal. My wife and mom ordered the shrimp scampi and split a Caesar salad and I ordered the Bolognese pasta with the Mista salad. When ordering Jeff told us the sides of the day were green beans and polenta. My wife and mom opted to get a pasta side (a $3 surcharge) as well. The salads were brought out and were were quite nice, not too small or too large. The Caesar is large enough for 2 people to split if all they want is a small salad before a meal. The Mista is a nice before meal salad as well. The dressing were nice without being overly heavy. We were also brought house bread. The bread was okay but I felt like it was the weakest part of the meal, nothing special. Interestingly enough we were served butter instead of oil and herbs. A little later we were served our entrees. My Bolognese was outstanding, quite hearty with a what I believe to have been a pork and veal combo with tomatoes and cheese. Rich and delicious served over spaghetti. The shrimp scampi was actually butterflied shrimp stuffed with garlic, parsley and other herbs. The pasta was drizzled with scampi sauce. One thing that was odd is that they charge you a $3 surcharge for the pasta and they don't bring you the side vegetables. We asked for them and they did bring them to us. I personally believe that if you want pasta in lieu of the side vegetables there should not be an additional charge. I mean how much does a cup of pasta cost? Luckily we did ask for the side vegetables because they were delicious. We had a nice leisurely lunch and enjoyed it immensely. I will most certainly return!"}
{"text":"Ha. Hahahahaha. HA!

Hilarious performance art masquerading as an Italian restaurant. I get it - I just had no idea that the Charlotte art scene had gotten so avant garde. 

No? You're telling me this place isn't an elaborate prank on unsuspecting diners? Well dang. Then this might just be the single worst Italian dining experience from a local Italian restaurant I have ever had. From the service to the overpriced mediocre food to the atmosphere this place is a total and complete bust. 

The server we had was completely unhelpful and literally wouldn't take our appetizer order until we ordered the entire meal because they were \"really busy and couldn't handle it.\" (Yes, really, a direct quote. Mind you that all the tables weren't even full and this was a Friday evening...so I don't even understand what would happen if you went on a less staffed night.) The food was horrible from the appetizer to the entree and we couldn't even stomach risking spending another penny on dessert because the entire meal was so blah. I don't know if it's policy or not at this restaurant but my water was brought out and never once filled again, and looking around at the other tables this was the case for them as well. 

The inside is a weird combination of decorations and the outside patio sits right in the middle of a parking lot...no ambiance in either location. 

I could probably go on and on and on about how horrible this place is but the bottom line is this: avoid at all costs. Hell, go buy a bottle of Ragu at the next door Harris Teeter and save yourself the money and agony of dining at this establishment. I can assure you you wouldn't notice the difference."}
{"text":"The caprese app was fresh, the buffalo mozzarella was probably one of the better ones I've had in the states. The lobster ravioli was delicious! They should put it on the menu daily. I'll be coming back just for the caprese."}
{"text":"Went on a date with my wife last night. The food did not disappoint (awesome osso buco) but the sevice was inattentive bordering on disinterested. Ill give them a bit of a pass because they were packed for the valentines day crowd. But there are a lot of good italian choices out there... Will probably search elsewhere."}
{"text":"Go on Tuesday night for the amazing homemade gnocchi! I went to Italy this summer and this easily rivaled the best gnocchi I had there. It was butternut squash gnocchi with a gorgonzola cream sauce. I wanted to lick the plate it was so good!!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a light lunch but was extremely happy with my experience. I ordered the prosciutto and burrata knowing this duo could never let me down. However, this came with a homemade apricot jam that just put this dish over. For a simple lunch this packed way more flavor than I imagined it would! Not to mention the staff is amazing and the owner is a very friendly approachable guy. I heard they are getting renovations straight from Italy this December and I can't wait to see how the place will change. I will be back in for dinner soon I can guarantee!"}
{"text":"I have lived/worked near this area for a while now and always wanted to visit Dolce. My boyfriend and I found a groupon (worth $40) and figured it would be a great opportunity to give it a try! 
Let me start out by saying that Italian food is a pretty hard thing to mess up... but this was by far the worst Italian dining experience I have ever had. Honestly.. you are better off going to Carrabba's or some other chain... and will probably save at least $60.

Now I will admit.. I am a tiiiiiny bit biased after visiting Italy last summer :) However, Dolce was still anything but what I was expecting. 

To start, we were greeted by a hostess who's mouth was stuffed full of food while she asked us if it was just us two... This took a minute, I could hardly understand her with the mouthful of salad she was talking through. 
Dolce is a small, quaint little place - nothing fancy, but I have no complaints about the interior. 

I'll jump right to the meal. I ordered the Gnocchi w/ Pesto. We came on a Tuesday because we heard this is the only night they serve fresh gnocchi. What a waste... I have made this dish at home and would prefer that over what I was served here any day. Not to mention.. after adding chicken to my entree... it was over $22. I dont think I would have paid $8 when it was all said and done. The chicken was the worst I have ever been served.. and the pesto - anything but fresh. The gnocchi itself was ok, but the meal altogether - meh. 
My boyfriend ordered one of the veal options. served with a vegetable medley and some kind of rice pilaf. Usually we trade a fork-full of our meals with each other. I decided to decline to try his dish.. it looked anything but appetizing. His review was \"eh.. its alright I guess\" 

We also each had one glass of wine each. Even after our $40 groupon was added, the meal cost us an additional $40 - INSANE! 

This place is WAY overpriced and incredibly overrated. I would recommend any other Italian restaurant over this one. Safe to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Took my other half here last week to celebrate his birthday. Nice, cozy spot.. Service was great. He checked on us constantly making sure everything was great. I ordered the Bolognese. It was a little bland. My boyfriend ordered the FRUTTI DI MARE and it was uh-mazing!! It was so delicious that I kept stealing the shrimps from his plate! Lol. The dessert was absolutely divine. We chose the Gelato with espresso on top and it was a hit! We really enjoyed the food and service we received at this place."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for this Ristorante before making my ice skating debut.  It was quaint, hidden in the back of the Harris Teeter on East Blvd.  I purchased a LivingSocial deal.  I was impressed.  The staff was very service oriented and the owner was pleasant as well.  I will definitely return with a friend or two."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Dolce for quite some time. This is a great little place. The inside is quaint. The decor is nothing extravagant, but it is attractive. We had excellent service. Our server recommended a great wine, based upon my liking and was more than happy to offer info re: the restaurant's \"Gnocchi Tuesday's\" that we'd read about online. Our server was accommodating & attentive. Now for the really good stuff - the food! The bread was served with a light tomato, olive oil, & cannelini bean salad. The caesar & spinach salads were both perfectly dressed. The pastas were fresh & the sauces were creamy & flavorful. We failed to leave room for dessert because we couldn't stop eating our pastas! We can't wait to go back for \"Gnocchi Tuesday\" & we will try dessert next time!"}
{"text":"It is not often that I opt for Italian food as a go-to, but if I'm doing Italian I'm ordering through Dolce.  They've got a little bit of everything and GREAT desserts!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for date nights. It's a Charlotte classic, and it's been around for so many years for a reason. The wine and beer selection are awesome, and the food is great. They switch it up seasonally, so if you haven't been in a while, you can always expect a surprise if you come back later. I really like the diversity, and in my opinion, the food is authentically Italian. It's as good as you'll get in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The decor looks like HomeGoods DIY, it's overpriced, and the service isn't great, but you know what's amazing? The gnocchi. I keep buying LivingSocials when they have them so I can eat delicious, delicious gnocchi at a more reasonable price point. Having only ever eaten frozen gnocchi, I didn't even think I liked the stuff. After eating here, I definitely like it. A lot. 

When they have it as a special, I entirely recommend the lobster gnocchi. It's pillowy gnocchi in parmesan cream sauce with nice, big lobster chunks, sun dried tomatoes, and spinach. After the bread and beans that come free (and sometimes sharing a burrata appetizer plate), I have trouble finishing the portion they serve. It makes a nice lunch the next day. 

My dining companion tends to like Dolce's tomato sauce with chicken or their bolognese sauce on her gnocchi. Both have a rich complexity of flavor that makes me want to burn down a couple of chain Italian places so no one has to suffer their sweet, bland sauces ever again. So, don't make me commit arson by comparing this place to a big box, just make a reservation, swing by on a Tuesday (gnocchi!) night, and learn the truth."}
{"text":"Amazing pesto gnocchi and delicious penne al la vodka. Service was great thanks to Paul. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"love the bread and dip. eggplant lasagna special was excellent as well. cannolis also good."}
{"text":"Dolce is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Charlotte. It is a very cozy restaurant with great Italian food. My favorite is the rotolini, rolled eggplant stuffed with cheese and sauce. Yum!! The wait staff is  also very attentive but not intrusive. If you like Italian you need to stop here."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian!   Wild mushroom ravioli with lobster creamy cheese sauce was awesome!"}
{"text":"Totally 5 star. We went for restaurant week and omg incredible. We usually don't go to the restaurants that are participating in restaurant week due to the crowds and all the amateur diners :)  But I wanted Italian and I know this place is under new ownership so we went. We had the stuffed mushrooms which were so good. I had the noodles with the home made bison ragu soooo good. I wish it was a little more saucy but that's just my preference but the taste was mmm mmm. My wife had their home made gnocchi OMG so light and fluffy we are actually going back tomorrow and I'm taking clients with us. Go on Tuesday or Friday and you have to get the gnocchi it's the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I think I've been to Dolce 3 or 4 times since I've lived in Charlotte. I really love the ambiance here - inside and outside. It just has nice character in the dining room and the perfect lighting. They also have a big, enclosed patio if you'd like to sit outside. 

They bring you complementary bread with white beans to start your meal. The food is always superb - you can tell it's fresh and homemade. Most recently we had the veal piccata - delicious as always. 

We decided to split the house salad and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. They have a good selection of wines and you can definitely find something around $30, so not too expensive. 

Sadly our server this recent trip was a major fail. Starting out with telling us their wine special \"tasted like crap\" - then joking that he wouldn't \"check on our table again\" if I made a special request for my entree. Really?! Unfortunately, he fulfilled that by not checking on us again or even bringing us water or refilling our wine. Yikes! Our food took FOR-EVER to come out, now I'm not sure if that was the waiter's fault of if the kitchen was way backed up. Either way, we were starving by the time dinner came out. 

I hope this was a one-time occurrence because other than our service this time, I would still go back to Dolce for their delicious food."}
{"text":"The owner is truly Italian, so the dishes are really authentic. The pasta sauces is not overloaded with garlic, in fact there isn't garlic at all ! That's real italian! We came over here several times, the capresi salad is really nice and fresh. The gnocchi is amazing, but only served on Tuesdays. It is worth a trip in the beginning of the week just to try it out! Owners are truly Italians, so this is the real deal!

Whenever you would like to taste a great Italian meal and can't afford Luce in uptown, this is your place!"}
{"text":"For over 10 years I have seen this restaurant...I have wanted to try it and never got the chance..I am so glad..yesterday afternoon in the middle of a huge thunderstorm - we decided to go to DOLCE. Its Queens Feast this week --they had so many choices and let me just say they did not pare down the size of the portions. We were greeted by the most friendly and competent staff of servers...a couple were related to the Owner..(daughter and son ). We sat down and Joanne brought us our menu's and some bread and a white bean relish. This was my choice. I went with the Prosciutto and Burrata Appetizer, Then the Veal with Artichoke and Lemon, and then the Torta Chocolatina. Everything was delicious, no skimping on the portions and it was prepared with love. I will be coming back - again and again. I wish I had tried it sooner ..Don't wait..go and try Dolce."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Dolce for 7 sweet years, and have always been happy with the food, service and overall experience. Tonight was no exception, so I thought I'd pass along the good word. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was excellent and served with a bourbon cream sauce. Mmm. For entrees we had the stuffed shrimp special, served with risotto and asparagus, as well as the stuffed cannelloni with chicken. We paired with a glass of Sangiovese and Pinot Noir. Crazy good. The ambiance is quiet, cozy and romantic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have dined extensively throughout Florence, Rome, and Venice; however, I have NEVER been as pleased by a pasta dish as I am with Dolce's incredible gnocchi.  The restaurant only offers this menu item on Tuesdays due to the intense labor of hand-making the pasta, and offers five sauces (one of which is a wildcard) to accompany it.  The pasta is melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious and the four-cheese sauce that I can never resist is the perfect compliment.  My wife has had the vodka sauce and meat sauce on different occasions, and was very satisfied with both.

Stepping off my ivory gnocchi tower, the restaurant scores well in other categories as well.  The service is friendly, attentive, and speedy; the location offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating; delicious bread is served as a warm-up; the wine list is expensive; and the menu is not over-priced.  They offer a nice array of desserts if you haven't stuffed yourself too full of pasta - we ordered the tiramisu both times and loved it.

If you've never been before, go on a Tuesday and don't stray from the gnocchi - I promise you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Food was decent and portion size was acceptable. The things that disheartened me was that the seafood appetizer was inconsistently cooked with the calamari being chewy and overcooked while their was an undercooked mussel, and things that were described as \"spicy\" had no spice at all. The boar pasta tasted bland, the gnnochi was underseasoned, and the ravioli was suposed to be in a wine sauce but it was served in the same identical tomato cream sauce on the gnnochi and under the stuffed mushrooms. All three of these items spoke of different sauces! I couldn't relay any of my critiques to my server as she barely visted our table and kept trying to hurry us along. I was even frustrated that ordering regular filtered water was going to cost me 5 dollars a glass so we drank the unfiltered tap water. They tried to make tap water seem fancy by serving it in a glass bottle. Our table probably went through 5 baskets of bread before our mains came out of the kitchen and the wait staff was so annoyed every time we requested more bread. I spent 50 dollars on this queens feast meal hoping to have an amazing meal because the gentleman greeting us was so charming but was very underwelmed. Our table was so close to another table if I got up I was afraid my body would hit their food and no privacy for our conversations amongst my friends. I hate to say this but honestly I would have paid half this at olive garden and probably eaten better at this point. Also thinking back to my recent experience at Texas Roadhouse or Olive Garden they never got annoyed at us for requesting more rolls/bread when food was taking a long time in the kitchen. Literally the only thing we could say we loved was our desserts."}
{"text":"I've lived here in Charlotte for 8 years and this is by far the best Italian food we've had at a restaurant. The food was incredible. The ambiance is deceiving both front the outside and when you get inside. It doesn't appear to be high end but the food did not disappoint.  The stuffed mushrooms are the best I've ever had. I orderded the veal and that too was excellent. Five stars if the decor matched the food quality. We'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"The house beans and bread alone are worth a visit.  My favorite items on the menu are the burrata, bruschetta, the fresca salad with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento pasta with shrimp and pink alfredo sauce, and the Amatriciana pasta (just a touch spicy).  Great date-night ambiance inside, and the patio area offers a casual option too."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. My wife and I came here for restaurant week and everything was absolutely perfect. I enjoyed some of the best gnocchi I've ever had, and my wife enjoyed a succulent serving of chicken Napoli. The wine selection was fantastic and the desserts were out of this world. Dolce is hands-down the best Italian meal I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The servers were all kind and the food was served in a timely manner. The new decor is lovely."}
{"text":"The very first time I went here when I lived across the street, I was not impressed.  I was coerced to give them another shot.  The second time they blew my mind with the best Seafood Linguine I've ever had.  I think it was a special cause every other time I go now (not that often) I can't get it.  They put a 180 on my subjective opinion, and I'm glad to say that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I love a great Italian restaurant, and I've been searching for a great one since I moved here to Charlotte.  I purchased a Groupon, and decided to hit this place up on a Wednesday night with my partner.  I really REALLY love food, and I really wanted to love this place.  I don't give many negative reviews, but I was so disappointed in this place.

First thing in the door, the hostess was not terribly welcoming.  Our server was a bit snobbish as well.  I realize that Dolce is a more expensive place for food, but I felt unwelcome wearing a nice pair of jeans and a nice sweater.   Also, the place was only half full, but it was really loud in there.  I could barely converse with the person sitting in front of me at our tiny table.

Our food was quite slow to arrive, and when it did, parts of it were only lukewarm.  I ordered a salmon special there, and my partner ordered the lobster ravioli special.  My fish was cooked well, but it was WAY too salty.  I had a zucchini casserole on the side, which was lukewarm.  Potato croquettes came with it, which were pretty different from others I've had, and they were pretty good.  My partner could not even taste any lobster in the ravioli, and the sauce was too salty as well.  Believe me, I LOVE salt, but it was barely palatable with so much on our dishes.  I think it might have been the sauces they used.

When dessert arrived, I ordered the tiramisu and my partner ordered the chocolate mousse thing (I can't remember the same, sadly).  The mousse was delicious and the texture was perfect.  The tiramisu was one of the best I'd ever had - a very strong coffee flavor infused throughout the whole dessert.  Dessert is the reason I don't give this place only one star.

When the bill came, our dinners were $16 for the ravioli (about 8 of them in the order, total) and $18 for the salmon, and $7 each for the desserts.  I'm so glad I had the Groupon and only had to pay half.  Another thing that really irked me was that they added an automatic 18% gratuity to our bill for using the Groupon.  I generally tip 20-25% on an order, as a general rule (I've worked in food service, so I try to be very generous).   I was pretty insulted that the restaurant assumed that I wouldn't pay a fair tip using the coupon, especially since it did not specify on the Groupon that we would be required to pay automatic gratuity.  

Basically, what I have to say is that I'm glad we had the Groupon, because it would not have been worth the $60 total + tip we had to pay.  I really wanted to go back on a Tuesday to try their homemade gnocchi, but I don't think I'm willing to put up with bad service and inflated prices.  Surely there has to be a better Italian restaurant here in Charlotte.  My final word of advice: expensive does not necessarily mean quality, at least in this case."}
{"text":"Just okay. Thankfully we came here with a groupon because I don't think we'll be coming back. Nothing impressive."}
{"text":"I had a living social that was expiring. My girlfriend and I where set to go but she ended up having to leave town so I was all alone. They were very accommodating to me and allowed me to get an entree to save for her. The decor is pretty typical of most Italian places. The service was great my server was very attentive. He put my second entree in so it was ready when I left. I got the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and they were amazing. I almost licked the plate. I got the Marcela for my main course, it was cooked perfect and tasted wonderful. I will be going back when my girlfriend is able to go with me."}
{"text":"Another Italian restaurant in Charlotte, another strip mally location. I'm never a fan of that, but what can you do? 

The food was great, which I guess is all you can really care about. It's not as big as Mama Ricotta's, but it's just as packed usually, so you'll have to get a reservation or eat at an early hour (especially if it's a Friday or Saturday night). There always seem to be birthday dinners going on here (usually people in their twenties or early thirties), which I think bodes well for any restaurant. Definitely popular with young professional types, but lots of families there, too--although i would hesitate to call it a family restaurant. Little too classy, little pricy for that denotation. 

But like I said, it's great. Try to pasta alla vodka; definitely my favorite. And drink the wine--it's all really good."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I've been to Dolce.  I bought a Groupon which gave me a new reason to come back soon.

We were seated in the back room which overlooks Kenilworth Dr.  The decor of the room is interesting with wreaths and masks hung on the walls. I'd never expect that in an Italian place.

For an appetizer, we ordered the Bruschetta.  The topings were fresh and very tasty.   For a meal, I ordered the tilapia which was a good portion.  Each meal comes with a starch and veggie of the day.  The veggie was assorted squash and the starch was mashed potatoes.  The veggies were good and tender in a light sauce.  The tilapia came also with a white wine sauce.   

The highlight of this meal was dessert.  I had the tiramisu and one of my friends had the lemon sponge cake which I was able to sample.  Both were very light and lightly sweet.  Probably some of the best tiramisu I've had.  

The two flaws here were when we came in, we were asked if we had a reservation and we did not and the owner said \"Please wait until I figure out what to do with you\".  Wow.  There was no line, there were plenty of tables, especially outside and I just thought that comment was kind of rude.  

The other flaw is that we had to ask for bread after our meals arrived.  This should have arrived prior to the meal but our waiter forgot.  Not a biggie.  Things like this happen sometimes."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.

Word to the wise: the reason this restaurant always has a LivingSocial deal available (literally always) is because they need to entice new diners to take a chance on eating there, because they know they won't be returning.

The meal started with bread.  Cold, dry, somewhat stale bread, accompanied by a tiny cannellini bean salad.  Bread was terrible, bean salad was okay.  Despite its inferior quality, we saved most of the bread because we had the white wine mussels appetizer coming.

Let's be real.  No one orders the white wine mussels for the mussels.  Are they tasty?  Sure.  But we all know you order the white wine mussels for the white wine sauce they come in, so you can somewhat disguise your gluttony by saturating the complimentary bread with it rather than drink the sauce straight from the vessel.  That's just how it is.  Unfortunately, the mussels came in what must have been 2-3 tablespoons of sauce.  That's it.  It was actually pretty tasty, but there was so little of it that it imparted literally zero flavor into the mussels themselves and we even had leftover bread after wiping the bowl dry of the wine sauce.

Now on to the mussels themselves: don't get these.  When removing them from the shell, I've never encountered mussels that have so consistently had a small piece of shell break off still attached to the meat.  I didn't notice on the first one and got a nice crunchy mouthful of calcium carbonate.  Almost every one after that, I had to pluck pieces of broken shell from the meat before eating.

My wife and I ordered caesar salads before our mains.  What came out had romaine lettuce, dressed in caesar dressing with parmigano of dubious quality sprinkled over it, and also...tomatoes?  And hard boiled egg quarters?  I've never seen that before on a caesar salad.  Wholly unnecessary.  Oh, by the way, when our server offered a salad to accompany our entrees, he didn't mention that they'd both be the full price of $8 each.  For an utterly mediocre salad that wasn't even very large.  Ripoff.

For our main course, I got the bolognese and she got the penne vodka.  When I think of a bolognese, I think of a meaty, rich sauce clinging to each piece of pasta.  What I got was reminiscent of watery ground beef.  It also had a bit of a sweet off-taste that neither of us were fond of.  At least her penne vodka was decent, since it's pretty hard to screw that up.

As far as the food goes...

Bread 1/5
Mussels 1/5
Salad 1/5
Main course 2/5 (simply for the penne vodka)

Service?  Service was decent.  Our server was actually quite pleasant.  The only issue there was that we may as well have had an additional appetizer and entree of cigarette smoke.  He absolutely reeked of it and that does not do wonders for the appetite.

This place is a sham.  Don't be fooled.  There is nothing of value here."}
{"text":"We came here after buying a groupon and it quickly because one of our favorite restaurants!  The dishes were authentic and full of flavor.  I would recommend any dish on their menu!"}
{"text":"We called to see if the restaurant had tables and the guy that answered said we could come any time as they had plenty of openings and we went ahead and made a reservation.

When we got there we were told it was only outside (which was too hot and humid).  Somebody went to get the owner, another waiter came by and rudely & loudly told the owner in front of us that we had to sit outside. 

The owner said \"I got nothing\"

I understand that Dolce is a neighborhood gem and we've eaten there before & have been satisfied.  Maybe if it was a real patio & not a plastic enclosed oven we would have taken outside. but with that experience...

I doubt they care, but we won't be back & won't recommend it."}
{"text":"Had there not been a few little glitches this should get 5 stars.  Three of us dined at 7:30 on a Friday night.  We were let to our table by an owner, given no menus, and ignored for 15 minutes.  Servers rushed by and successfully avoided looking our way.  Finally a nice server came by and apologized, saying something about not having designated stations. He asked who seated us and evidently discussed it with the owner.  After that, we had attention from the server and the owner and we thought they redeemed themselves satisfactorily.

My Sorrento pasta was DELICIOUS.  The pasta was freshly made that week and the sauce was so good. One of my companions had the Gnocchi special of the night and she raved about it. The other companion had the salmon and opted for broccolini I to go with it.  They were out of broccolini so she got broccoli  instead. She said that everything was very good.

When the food was delivered by someone else, no shredded Parmesan was offered. We waited and didn't see anyone to call over.  When the owner came to check on us, I asked abut the cheese and he, in fun, yelled at our server that we was fired. The cheese came.

The menu had a Limoncello martini listed.  I asked for just a Limoncello.  They were out. Evidently, a group had shots and they didn't expect more until Monday.  The restaurant doesn't make its own.

The owner and the server treated us to a dessert to share (Limoncello cake) which was very, very good. Also, we were treated to glasses of Amaretto.

Mistakes were handled well, the food is delicious, the owners and employees are nice. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"my review is not gonna thrill you, but i hope to add a little assurance to any hint of doubt you may have of this place. 

yes, yes, yes. the gnocchi is legen-wait for it-dary. while some may find it's supreme softness (like a potato pillow, if you will) slightly off-putting--know this. i married into an italian family. one which grew up on real italian food. one which has visited their homeland quite a few times and been to numerous restaurants that serve \"authentic\" gnocchi. this is the real deal, and this is how it's s'posed to be. can you dig?! anyhoo, if you are lucky enough to get the gnocchi they make with butternut squash--do it! it's outstanding. oh yeah, and it has pancetta. which is like bacon. which is like food from the gods. 

they have another special that my husband dreams about. it's the pistachio (?) encrusted lamb chops. or something like that. i had a nibble, and it's pretty much cooked to perfection. 

i love the coziness of the place, and i love how they change it up and make you practically swoon all week waiting for tuesday. if you get on their email list too, you get the scoop on what's going on at the restaurant as far as special menu and even gnocchi-making classes. seriously, how could you go wrong here?"}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here on a Friday night and a Tuesday night. Atmosphere is poor, wine list expensive and not good  ($44 for an $8 bottle of wine), and the food is more miss than hit. The desserts are great though. Would have been more disappointed if I hadn't had Groupon. 

Wait staff were great. The cooking staff need help."}
{"text":"I was at Dolce earlier this week for a casual business dinner. Since I am not local to Charlotte I did my homework through Yelp, as I always do, and found all the comments about Gnocchi Tuesdays, so i was ready. First, the overall atmosphere of Dolce is very nice, it definitely has that family restaurant feel to it, which I always enjoy. Our waiter was very patient, pleasant, and informative so another plus. I had planned to order the gnocchi as an entree, but the group wanted to try it as an appetizer, so we did that. there are four sauces choices and ours was the four cheese sauce. For the entree I chose the penne pasta in a vodka sauce. The gnocchi was wonderful - tender and very tasty. I wanted more and wished that I had went ahead and ordered my own portion. The penne was very good, but the memory of the gnocchi still was a distraction. We took out time with the meal and conversation and watched the restaurant fill up and when we left it was completely full. Another very nice evening and meal in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A big fat Meh. 

Admittedly I am a huge Italian snob, I grew up eating a ton of it and really adore the cuisine. After reading so many fabulous reviews I was prepared to be blown away!  We dined outside in their patio under the awning (in a busy parking lot)  on a Tuesday night - not the most secluded nor relaxing, but it's in a strip mall of sorts and the beautiful night made it A-ok with me. 

We started with the Funghi appetizer (baked mushrooms/cheese/sausage with cognac cream sauce). While the flavor was good the mushrooms were way off temperature wise and tasted barely heated through. I would have been happy with this dish if the food was hot.

I don't mind paying almost $7 for a salad if the dressing is delicious. I am shocked that they advertising their Caesar dressing as homemade because it tastes suspiciously like a pre-mix bag salad kit dressing. I did like that it had an egg on the side but it was nothing special - not even particularly good. I didn't  finish mine.

My main course was the raved about gnocchi. I went with the 4 cheese sauce and split that with a friend who had the bolognese (fyi it is $3 extra if you want extra sauce on the side). The pasta was WAY overcooked, pretty much balls of mush. The sauces were lackluster. I did get to try the other two (pesto and brown butter sage). The pesto was voted best among the group, but I really thought it was nothing special. I've had much better gnocchi...Aria for example. 

Our server was a nice guy who really tried to accommodate us, though he was entirely too quiet. I could barely hear him and I was closest seated to the end. 

Overall it was a bit of a let down, on to the next Italian restaurant...."}
{"text":"This place is located in Dilworth area in a shopping center. It's pretty big so parking is hard to find. We were immediately greeted. We did make a RSVP. We got sat at a nice window table. Service was excellent through the whole night! We ordered the funghi appetizer and we were not disappointed! Mushrooms were huge and the stuffing was delicious! The sauce that was spread on the plate made even more amazing. I got the sarrento dish. It was fettuccini pasta with shrimp and spinach and sun dried tomatoes in a pink Alfredo sauce. There were large portions of shrimp. It was so good. It was my second time getting it and I will probably get it again. My fiancé got the bolognese. Tasted good and fresh.  Sauce wasn't that heavy and it had just the right amount of meat. I ordered a Coke and they gave me a can with a glass of ice. We were surprised to see it was $2.50 just for that can of Coke! I thought the most would be $1.50. Other than that, we were pleased with our visit."}
{"text":"\"ahhhhhhhhhh!\" (that's the sound I assume heaven makes when it opens up its pearly gates...)

Homemade gnocchi, kids. Yes indeedy, little potato made nuggets of love can be found here on Tuesdays. Why Tuesdays only? Well, gnocchi is pretty time consuming to create, so that's the day they offer it at Dolce. And it is deeeelightful. 

I've been here twice, but finally remembered to hit up Dolce on a Tuesday for some delectable gnocchi. Since it was being delivered from Foodie Call, I had to make the difficult of decision of type of sauce, all of my own. I had no waiter to guide me...do I choose pesto? Or fresh tomato? Or four cheese? How about bolognese? Or maybe butter sage?! *head explodes*

Well, I went with the four cheese because I was at home and I was already sportin' my sweatpants. But I also requested a side of fresh tomato sauce too, just to have some variety available. Holy yum. These little nuggets of joy are superbly made, cooked just a bit al dente and bathing in just enough sauce...it'll make you say mmmmmmmmm. I  enjoyed the four cheese, but it was a bit heavy for me. The fresh tomato was a really nice alternative and I'm glad I ordered it. 

What else did I order on this chunkerific night in for myself? Tiramisu, of course. I had to try it - and Dolce makes it well. Tasty layers of sweet ricotta mixed in with layers of rum and espresso soaked lady fingers. Well done, Dolce. It's not the best tiramisu I've had, but it's certainly solid. Nom. 

Eat on, friends."}
{"text":"When the $50 Groupon offer arrived in my inbox, I jumped at the opportunity, as I have had a good experience here in the past.

I made reservations for 8:00 on Friday night under my full name.  Apparently there was another \"Stephanie\" party, and we were seated at an empty table of 10.  Needless to say, everyone was confused, but the owner came by and straightened everything out.  She was very sweet and accommodating.

We ordered a bottle of wine and two appetizers: the buratta special which was extraordinary and the stuffed mushrooms which were quite tasty as well.  The timing was a bit off though. We did not get our bread or any of the appetizers for about 30 minutes after the wine came out.  I was starting to get a little dizzy. I recommend the servers bring out the bread at the same time as the drinks. 

The appetizers were the highlight of the evening. For my main dish, I ordered the mugniaia- tilapia sautéed with cherry tomatoes, sweet red peppers, capers, Italian olive & Pinot Grigio sauce.  The fish was not bad, but the broccoli it came with was overcooked and honestly reminded me of cafeteria broccoli.  The food was not bad, but for the price, I expected more.  

Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts in the world, so of course we had to order one of those.  I would have rather stopped by Menchie's on the way home for some $4.00 dulce de leche fro yo than eat that. I stopped after two bites.  The lady fingers were very dry and lacking in flavor.

I was pretty bummed as I was so excited to eat here (it was my idea after all).  For Italian, I much prefer Rudy's and Toscana at South Park."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.  We have been here 2-3 times in the past and have had good experiences.  My husband loves good gnocchi.  The first time we went here it was on a Tuesday so we could try the gnocchi because we had heard how delicious it was. We don't get to go regularly on Tuesdays because of our work schedules.  When I saw they were offering the gnocchi on their restaurant week menu, I immediately made reservations to go on a Friday night.  When we arrived we were led to the back dining area.  The main dining room was only about half filled (it was a 6:30 reservation) and there were 5-6 other tables with parties of 2 in the main dining room sitting at nice two-tops, four-tops and two women sitting at a six-top.  We were seated at a table in the back dining area, which was not a big deal until we sat down and realized it was an outside/patio table they had brought inside and put a tablecloth on.  It was extremely light so everytime you moved, put your elbow on the table or moved something on the table, the whole table moved/shifted.  The chairs were regular chairs for the dining tables so they didn't move all the way up to the table.  Plus the table was about 3 inches shorter than a regular dining table.  We felt like we were sitting at the kids table on Thanksgiving Day. We ordered our drinks and then I went to the restroom.  The ladies room was occupied so I waited 2-3 minutes and then watched as a male employee exited the ladies room.  We didn't want to order the restaurant week \"3 courses for $30\" but my husband did want gnocchi since they were offering it on a night other than Tuesday.  When we asked about ordering it and just paying the regular Tuesday night price our server told us he would have to check, that he had already been yelled at for substituting a sauce on someone elses order.  Other than that the service was okay.  We ended up ordering the shrimp scampi and the chicken rolletini dish.  Both were bland and not good.  We won't go here again.

Shouldn't the service and food be BETTER on a restaurant week night, when people are likely to try new places? Too bad."}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner here. The staff was attentive and helpful even on a busy Friday night. definitely make reservations. The wine was excellent and we enjoyed the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"For me, Dolce was a mixed bag. 

On the plus side, the food is REALLY goddamn good and quite authentic. I was in Italy a month ago and the food here was as good. Let me break it down for you...

Burrata and prosciutto starter ($12.50) - order this. The burrata is creamy wonderful deliciousness and the prosciutto paired perfectly. Spread it all on authentic Tuscan bread (served with a small ramekin of bean salad). You could make a light dinner of this plate if you wanted to.

My carbonara ($17.95) was damn good too - creamy and full of pecorino tastiness. My BIL loved his amitriciana bucatini pasta as well. 

I also liked that the space was fresh and clean - it appears to be newly remodeled. There's a big covered patio too - smoking is allowed out there which can be a plus or minus depending on your proclivities. 

Now....on to the downsides. When we visited, they were pretty dead but our service was inattentive. You could argue, probably correctly, that this is truly Italian service where they don't bother you. So plan to spend some time. 

Finally - they had a food prep station at the first table inside the door. That sat, unused, with a big bowl of ravioli filling and fresh pasta sheets....for at least 2 hours, unrefrigerated and uncovered. Literally in the dining room where any random could touch or cough on it. Not okay. Especially considering during that time 1/2 the kitchen staff was sitting in the patio smoking like chimneys. Like guys, just don't let me see all this ok? 

This place is authentic on many levels - you decide if it's right for you. I'd go back because the food really was awesome but I'd say hell no to the ravioli!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had to try Dolce again under its new ownership.  I'm happy to say that the new owners have addressed the prior issues we had with Dolce (i.e., limited menu, high prices, terrible music) which had prevented us from coming more frequently.  Even better, the food--which was never a complaint before--is just as good.

We started with the burrata.  The new version has prosciutto, and is a larger portion than previously, at a lower price.  Yay!  I never could stomach paying $16 for the prior version.  And this new version is just delicious.  

For our entrees, I had the linguini a la genovese, a light pesto sauce with shrimp.  I liked that the pasta wasn't over-sauced, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The portion was large enough I could bring home leftovers, too.

My husband had the scogliera, a linguini dish with shrimp, clams, mussels, and calamari.  The sauce was not really very spicy, but it was extremely flavorful, and my husband said he'd absolutely get this dish again.

Maybe only one concern was that there didn't appear to be enough wait staff.  And they were extremely busy.  Maybe that's something the new owners can address as they see a continued full house.

We returned a few months later, and my husband had their penne a la vodka with shrimp.  It was as good as their version under the previous ownership.  I again had the linguini a la genovese.  Of the two, I think the penne a la vodka is slightly better.  The sauce is just so deliciously rich and creamy.

They also had more wait staff, and service was fantastic.  When we were leaving, the owner warmly asked how we enjoyed our meal.  He told us of exciting renovations he is making to the interior, such as wood floors and ceiling.  Everything should be done by 12/6.  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Just had an Amazing Gnocchi with Lobster in a light cream sauce. The gnocchi was delicate and tasty. The lobster well very complimentary to the gnocchi did not seems as fresh as the waiter might have promised. I added some pepper and ate as much as my stomach could manage. Right now I am full and satisfied. My daughter was there for the Chicken Schnitzel ...."}
{"text":"I am shocked this place doesn't have better reviews??? 
This place is the best Italian food in Charlotte. I moved here from Philadelphia and have gone to plenty of the best Italian restaurants in Philly, as well as NYC. Dolce is authentic and delicious. And the owner is Italian!! (Sweet lady) 
I have been here several times and always get something different. It is always great. I Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was great there's no doubt but the portions were very small. The service... they need to work on that. The waitress needs smile more and be more attentive to the customers. 1 Cannoli that's about the size of your index finger costs $7. So not professional! But there's a very tiny chance that I might come back"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great fresh pasta and quick service. I have been able to find groupons pretty easily but even without it the prices are not too bad.

Come on Tuesdays- fresh gnocchi!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time on a Friday night. Very crowded, you are practically sitting on top of each other with barely enough room to maneuver between tables, I really hate when restaurants do that.  Our meals took a very long time to come out.  Once our meals came out they were good, nothing special that I would be dying to go back for, but good.  This place is good but there are many other Italian restaurants in Charlotte that are just as good if not better and not so pricey. In my opinion this place is WAY overpriced.  Come on folks pasta is about a buck fifty a pound so when you charge over $16 for pasta and sauce and another $3-5 to add a meat to the dish  it's just a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"We ordered the eggplant and linguini with seafood, the food was good, the service is bit slow on a Saturday night, maybe because of the packed room, other than that, cannot complain much. The dining was nice and cozy"}
{"text":"Perfect place for dinner on a cold December night.  Cozy room, very attentive service and excellent food.  The bread with white beans and olive oil is a nice treat on the table.  The salads were big and tasty and the pasta entrees didn't disappoint.  Bruschetta was also very good. 
Wine is reasonably priced by the glass.

Overall, excellent.  It is pricey for Italian food, but you come away satisfied and it feels worth the money."}
{"text":"Dolce is tasty. A bit pricey for the portion sizes but a good date night/special occasion place. I think ownership has changed but they don't appear to have missed a beat. Food is good and consistent."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Dolce, and while the food and ambience are great, things are keeping this restaurant from being top tier.  We ordered the appetizer on special.  When the check came it was double every other app on their menu.  Second, they have warm soft drink by the can.  They charge 2.50 for each can.  Normal restaurants have 16-20 ounce fountain glasses with free refills for right around the same price.  Waiter seemed very anxious to clear our plates, although we still had 1/4 food left.  These issues along with a very limited protein appetizer menu keep this restaurant from being a competitor to the other Italian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We decided to try this spot on the famous gnocchi Tuesday, and wow we were glad we did!

Our server was attentive, kind, and helpful. This definitely helped enhance our experience. 

Good wine selection. No draft which is a tad disappointing, but expected. 

The meal began with bread and a cannelloni dip. We enjoyed the bean idea, but it wasn't well executed as others have mentioned. The beans were cold, as was the bread. If this has been a common complaint for them, I am surprised they don't change to a better bread that is warm with olive oil and spices or butter.  I think they could still do the bean dip, but they definitely need better bread. Everyone wants warm bread at an Italian place!  We asked our waiter where the bread came from, and he told us it was from Nova's bakery. I like it's local, but please serve it warm.

Dinner completely turned everything around. Our dishes were excellent! We got the seafood pasta (frutti di mare) and the lobster gnocchi special. Holy cow the gnocchi. Among some of the best I've ever had. I understand now why they only do it one night a week because you can tell it is made fresh. There was a decent amount of lobster in the dish and it was in a pink, cream sauce. Both portions were huge, which made me feel better about the prices. The seafood pasta was nice as well. The seafood was cooked as it should be, and the spicy sauce was different and a nice touch.

We used a groupon, and I feel as though it was a great deal. I think now I may buy some more, so we can come back! Gnocchi Tuesday is the way to go. I think I might only go on Tuesdays haha because I have a feeling their gnocchi is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I visited during Charlotte's Restaurant Week on Saturday, 1/30/2016 around 5:30 PM. 

Let me tell you! The food here is DELICIOUS! I can tell it's homemade because some of it really tastes like I'm walking into some of the kitchen's of my Sicilian family members. The food is made with love. 

As a starter, fresh bread is brought to the table. The bread is soft in the middle and crusty on the edges. The olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette were good. In the basket were also white beans, which I'm not a fan of. 

For my appetizer, I had the Napoleon. It was a piece bruschetta style bread layered with fresh eggplant grilled to perfection, then a fresh slice of tomato underneath a hunky piece of mozzarella. It was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette reduction and goat cheese. The plate was adorned with a freshly hand-picked plump basil leaf! I devoured everything and wiped the plate clean!  Flavors were popping in my mouth! I love Napoleons and similar dishes wherever I go.. I was extremely pleased with Dolce's version and would EASILY come here again.. just for this dish! Excellent!

For my entree, I chose the Cannelloni, which is a basically a wrap type of noodle. You put the ingredients in it and roll it. This particular dish of cannelloni was filled or rather stuffed to capacity and overflowing with spinach, ricotta and mascarpone cheese. A small amount of creamy Parmigiano and a touch of tomato sauce was sprinkled on top. It was garnished with something I was unfamiliar with, but ate it anyways. This dish was delectable, however it was extremely heavy and rich. I only ate a third of it and had it boxed to go. I had another third of it later that evening and the remaining third the next morning for breakfast. 

For dolce or dessert, I elected to enjoy the Limoncello Chiffon Cake! It was light and airy, yet still creamy. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. I also loved the strawberry sauce drizzled on the plate. It was the perfect ending to a hearty meal.

So why 4 stars and not 5? Service. The lady servers who brought the food and took the finished plates were great, but my server not so much. He never introduced himself after I was seated. He sulked when I asked for water and not wine/alcohol. He checked on me by asking questions when my mouth was full with my appetizer and then walked away. He didn't give me time to finish my appetizer before bringing the main dish. He didn't check on me throughout my meal after that. He didn't keep my water glass full. I had to flag him down to ask and he did a million things before telling someone else to fill my glass. I was completely parched from the deliciously, heavy cannelloni. I needed my glass filled again later, but didn't even bother and it wasn't replenished. While I was eating dessert, he apparently brought the check, which I didn't notice because I was still eating.. who brings the check when you're still eating? How did he know I didn't want anything else? The Napoleon was so good, that I had wanted to take one home, but I felt so rushed that I later forgot my intention. It was only when he randomly popped up to grab the check and payment, while I was still eating that I noticed it was placed there. At that point, I advised that I was not ready yet. I took my time with my dessert, I believe food is to be enjoyed not just scarfed down. I enjoyed every flavor in that cake. I still left him a tip that was slightly greater than 15%. Now, if the service was more on the mediocre side rather than subpar or if service had even came close to the quality, love, preparation and presentation of the food, then my experience at Dolce would have been: hands down 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.

Each restroom is only suited for one guest, either a lady or a gentleman. The ladies room was a pretty shade of a purplish pink, a nice mirror, flowered plant, and of course a working toilet and sink. The soap dispenser was full. It was clean and tidy. 

It is important to note that parking in this mini-plaza can be a bit tricky. There were no spaces in the immediate parking lot and I ended up parking in the Harris Teeter parking lot, which is a very short walk away (think less than a city block.. you're still technically in the same overall parking lot)."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Dolce and apparently it's under new ownership based on previous reviews.  The food was very good but a tad overpriced considering no salads were included.  We started with the funghi appetizer, basically stuffed mushrooms which were excellent.  My husband had the Penne alla vodka with shrimp and I had the basciola pasta.  Both of our dishes were $20 entrees but did not include salads, which we both found to be overpriced, and the shrimp was tiny.   The flavor for both was excellent as well as the portion sizes.  Our service was great and very attentive, including visits by the new owner to ensure our meal was up to par.  We finished our dinner with limoncello cake and two espressos, both of which were fantastic.  All in all the meal was good, a bit too pricey, and will probably stick with Portofino's going forward, but happy we tried a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went on Tuesday 6/24 sat inside next to the entrance. We were glad we made reservation and skipped the 40 mins wait. We sat down and waited about 40-50 mins when our food were ready. That's ok, I understand it's a small restaurant and a lot people and Tuesday night special....... The food was OK, and it feels like a decent restaurant. 

Our check was $66.63, we had a coupon worth $50, so the rest of the bill was $16.63. The waiter brought our check, I thought my friend's coupon took care of everything then asked him for a pen. He was impatient the whole time, and told me in a really mean way:\"you didn't give me your card yet!\". Well, my bad for not knowing the situation. I was mad, and wrote $9 (14%) instead of a normal 15% or above tips. So the total was 25.63. Guess what, I happened to check my account today, it lists $30.63. Forgive me if there are other explanations such as I time traveled to the restaurant and changed my \"SIGNED\" receipt, otherwise, I really think somebody changed my receipt. 

If you are not happy with 14%, go think about how to please your customers and make them happy; if you can't stand my question due to lack of information, you probably need to learn how to communicate with other people; If you need to change my SIGNED receipt, you better be careful.

My credit card company gave me $10 back which all I really need is $5, so I'm not here because I lost money, but to tell everyone to be careful of your SIGNED receipt, and don't sit on the patio or next to the entrance, because this is the area where this waiter hanging out. 

I'll make sure I post this post everywhere, not for the $5, just hope nobody else goes through same experience. Of course, I'll guarantee none of my friends will go there."}
{"text":"Ok so I have to preface this review by saying that we didn't end up eating here.  My husband and I were looking for a place to eat and looked at Groupon to get some ideas and see if there were any deals nearby at the moment.  We saw Dolce which was a pretty close drive for us from Uptown, had never been so decided to give it a try.  We purchased the Groupon and headed to Dolce.  When we got there, they seemed a little disorganized.  After we finally got seated, we got our drinks and looked over the menu and decided our orders.  Waiter came back, and we told him our order and also mentioned that we have the Groupon.  He immediately asked if we bought it that day or a different day.  We told him we bought it today.  He said he didn't think the owner would accept it since we bought it that same day.  (this is not a Groupon rule and is not mentioned anywhere on the Groupon).  We showed him the voucher and told him there is no rule on using it the same day and he said he knew that but it was the owner who wouldn't allow it.  He went to go ask her and came back confirming we couldn't use it and was very sorry because there was no telling an old Italian lady how these things work.  That was funny.  Anyways, we decided if they weren't going to be honorable with the Groupon that we didn't want to eat there so needless to say we left and had Groupon refund the cost.  The Groupon rep confirmed that it should have been allowed to use the same day and promptly refunded.  This lady is pretty dumb though, because having a customer buy and use the same day means they truly got measurable value out of the marketing on Groupon as that was the reason we were even there vs. someone buying and keeping in their back pocket for a future date when they may need to go out to dinner on a discount.  Whatevs, if they didn't want our business that day, we won't be returning any other day either!"}
{"text":"A taste of Italy! It feels like you're entering a friend's Italian grandmother's house through the back door where only true friends enter when you walk in. 

Generally, I steer away from Restaurant Week spots but friends convinced me that early reservations would be ok. Glad I agreed. We were even seated a few minutes ahead of our reserved time. Hint: Dolce only serves their Restaurant Week menu during this time which made the flow of dinner super fast. And it helped my pocketbook because I rarely stick to the abbreviated menu but this method made sure that I did. 

We were greeted warmly and everyone was your server...a true Italian-family method. 

I started with the guazzetto as my appetizer. There was an ample supply of calamari rings (I prefer the rings) and mussels were plentiful. One lone large shrimp rounded out the dish that was served in a nice white wine sauce and topped with a triangle of crostini bread. 

For my entree, I chose the ravioli. Homemade, of course, the ravioli was stuffed with shrimp and crab in a Pinot Grigio aurora sauce. If you're not a fan of hearty red sauces, this is the way to go. The sauce was very creamy and rich. 

For dessert, I chose the tiramisu. It was very good and has just the right hint of coffee that was not overpowering like some can be. 

Everything from the food, service and ambiance were great. The only disappointment for me was the wine selection. To be an Italian restaurant, the choices seemed limited."}
{"text":"Pasta was good. wine was good. but I cant trust an ITALIAN restaurant that puts Herseys syrup on their tiramisu. Sorry."}
{"text":"First Visit to Docle Ristorante and we were treated to gnocchi night.  Every so often the make special hand made gnocchi to be served  on a special night.  Gnocchi is one of my favorite Italian dishes and Docle Ristorante did it right.

They offer several difference sauce flavors with the gnocchi so you could a style in any way you wanted.  I got the gnocchi special for the night which was a white cream pancetta sauce and it made my taste buds jump for joy.  

On gnocchi night, get there early cause they can sell out.  Also, check groupon or living social at times.  They have offer specials every now and then. 

I wasn't sure about the reservation system that they said we needed.  When we reserved and showed up were  the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought the food was delicious. I had eggplant rollitini, it was amazing. The sides for the evening were grilled veggies and risotto-- I'm not a huge veggie eater, but I gobbeled them up. Risotto was some of the best I've ever had. Wine prices were steep-- can't get a glass for under 8.50. Other than that, it was good"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here during restaurant week, and I think we found the best Italian food in Charlotte.  We got a polpettone and gnocchi for our entrees.  I swear, the gnocchi was like tasting a bit of heaven.  Easily the lightest gnocchi that I've ever tasted.  

I will definitely be heading back to Dolce soon!"}
{"text":"I've gotten Dolce a few times, usually via Foodie Call.. the pollo entrée (chicken scaloppini stuffed with ham, fresh spinach & cheese) is always good, and on Tuesdays the gnocchi with four cheese sauce is amazing - little pillows of deliciousness in your mouth."}
{"text":"One of the hardest parts of moving from New York to Charlotte was saying goodbye to good Italian restaurants. We've been to a couple down here but none could compare to what the Empire State could provide. Yet I'm never opposed to giving a place a first try, so when we saw an online deal for Dolce it was enough to entice us for a trip down to Charlotte. I'm glad we went, because we now have our go-to Italian restaurant.

Dolce is located in a strip mall-type area, which I'm always a fan of when venturing into Charlotte since it makes parking a breeze. We had a reservation and were greeted and seated upon entering the restaurant. It's a bit tight inside, and while the patio area looked a bit more comfortable the tables had all been reserved for a party later that night. The interior, while a bit cramped, was cozily decorated and really made it feel like an Italian restaurant. Our waiter was like the \"low talker\" from Seinfeld and I could barely hear a word he said, and the overall background sound of the place due to the tight quarters didn't help a bit. I had to ask him to repeat himself a couple of times and felt like a jerk for doing so, but what else can you do when your waiter can't speak up?

For an appetizer we had the special of the night, which was kind of like a deconstructed bruschetta. We got toasted bread with the tomatoes on the side, and a mozzarella SPREAD. I've never seen mozzarella prepared like this, and it was pretty dang good. There was also free bread service that was served alongside beans, which we've seen at one or two other Italian places in the area. 

For dinner I ordered the Bolognese ($15.95), and it was mind-blowing. It's such a simple dish, with spaghetti served with a meat sauce made of pork, beef and veal. I've had the dish at some other places and it was either sweet or bland, but this bolognese was tastetacular! The meat chunks played very nicely with the simple tomato sauce that was not overpowered with sugar or other unnecessary flavors. 

The missus had the Frutti Di Mare ($20.95) which was decent. The sauce had a bit of a kick to it with the heat, and the mussels were pretty good. The shrimp were a bit small and the scallops were non-existent, something we didn't catch until after the meal was over and she realized there hadn't been one on her plate. Just the spaghetti with a couple of mussels and small shrimp was not much of a meal for her, but the taste was solid.

For dessert we split the Tiramisu ($8) and that proved to be a great bite. It had just the right amount of espresso flavor where it wasn't ridiculously strong and bitter, but still had a bit of that bite to it. The lady finger structure was done right and had great texture. It was a dessert worthy of any Italian restaurant.

Dolce really proved to be a fantastic Italian eatery that I would be proud to take my visiting family to. They offer solid food at a reasonable price, and the staff aside from our server seemed to be on the ball. We'll definitely be back in the future, and I would really like to return on a Tuesday when they make their fresh gnocchi."}
{"text":"I love an Italian place that can dish out fresh pasta.. and phenomenal service! We decided to try Dolce on their famous handmade Gnocchi nights, every Tuesday night, today. And wow what a gem! Our server was amazing! I was dd, but the bf ordered a red blend for $8.5 while we munched on the awesome, complimentary cannelloni bean and bread app. I seriously could eat this bean app by itself without anything. We ordered the Serrento a little pricey at $23 as well as the 4 cheese gnocchi dish, $18, but, it is handmade every Tuesday. The food didn't take too long and I was so glad because it was awesome. The pink Alfredo had quite the bite! The shrimp in this dish was cooked to perfection. I did notice that the 4 cheese sauce was extremely Gorgonzola heavy, I could only eat a couple of gnocchi pieces at a time. The gnocchi though. woah, so fluffy and airy. I casually mentioned this to our server, and he gave us some great tips for next time. Go with a lighter sauce like pesto or tomato, gnocchi is already decadent. 

We will definitely be back for more. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Last night my sister and I chose this restaurant during Charlotte's Restaurant Week. We love Italian food and have fond memories of our grandmother's cooking. The 3 course meal was wonderful! We both chose something different for each course and not a one disappointed. Each were delicious. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't get the veal!!! It was the worst veal I think I've ever had, and their menu is overpriced for the quality of service and food you receive. Thankfully we had a groupon so it didn't hit the wallet that hard. Nothing that I would ever come back and purchase especially without a groupon."}
{"text":"Ah, Dolce.  A fabulous place to indulge in Italian food, and happily, right in my neighborhood too.  Hubby and I went thanks to a groupon that I had recently purchased and after many weeks of wanting to try it out.  But they are closed on Sundays - argh!  After reading some of the helpful reviews about Tuesday's gnocchi, we decided to get our gnocchi on. 

This place is full of awesome ambiance.  It's not SUPER fancy, but there were lots of people on more low key dates.  And even then, I still felt welcomed in my scrubs and without reservations.  It's definitely got a romantic atmosphere, but without being super pricey.  Maybe it was the lighting or the decor.  Whatever it was, I loved it!

Our server was basic.  Not the most amazing one ever, but appropriately attentive.  We started with the caprese app which was PERFECT!  Or maybe I've just been in mozzarella withdrawal.  Hubby and I both ended up getting the gnocchi as well, mine with the 4 cheese sauce and his with the pesto.  As others have said, the 4 cheese was a bit heavy, but that didn't stop me from finishing it!  The gnocchi was pretty damn fabulous.  Not quite as good as what I've had in Boston's North End, but the best I've had outside of it.  And the menu was extensive, so I know we'll be back to try some more.  Plus, prices were definitely reasonable.  We did get tiramisu for dessert.  It was solid, but not the most divine tiramisu I've ever had either.

All in all, I think Dolce is a fabulous neighborhood restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere and low key vibe.  The Tuesday gnocchi is definitely worth trying out, and you would be hard pressed to find a better Italian restaurant in the QC."}
{"text":"Dolce is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Consistently good Italian.  My favorite dish is the Amatriciana and the limoncello cake is to die for.  However, we were a little disappointed on our last trip.  We went with another couple. We had a Living Social Deal & they had a groupon.  We asked if we could be treated as 2 separate tables since we were going to have 2 different bills and that way we could both use or vouchers.  I completely understand the reason why you would want to limit the number of vouchers used, but if we are acting/paying/ordering as 2 separate tables I don't understand why they wouldn't let us use both.  As I mentioned, Dolce is one of our favorite restaurants and we've been there many times. It would have been nice if they had been a little flexible (perhaps saying they would allow it this once and wouldn't allow it again).  But they didn't and it made me feel like they don't value loyal customers."}
{"text":"I have to say, we have made Dolce our Tuesday dinner date night.  There is no better gnocchi than at Dolce on Tuesdays.  If you have Paul as your server, you're in for an even better treat.  Kind, attentive, excellent wine suggestions.  We love seeing him every week!"}
{"text":"I live in Atlanta and I ate here tonight with a party of 9 here on business.  The neighborhood and atmosphere were the high point.  The server was inexperienced, auctioned the food, passed plates to the guests, did not provide cheese or bread until asked.  The bread was slightly stale thin sliced white bread, no glass was offered with beer.  One of the meals didn't come out. After waiting for awhile and no one touching their food I asked the waiter if he knew we were missing a meal. He responded that they had burnt the shrimp but it would be out in a minute.  He brought it over no apology, no visit from the manager or owner.  At the end of the meal I asked the waiter if the late meal could be removed from the check.  He said he would check with the owner. He returned with the full check, item not removed with no explanation no visit from the owner.  We had appetizers, bottles of wine, 9 entrees. I have waited tables, managed restaurants, and I would never return and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Very unwelcoming reception. We had made reservations for four adults...oops,we  forgot to include our 8-year-old grandchild, whom they refused to accommodate with one more chair inside..so we were all relegated to outside seating, where it was completely empty, yet were seated in the corner where it was a mere 99 degrees from the blasting overhead heaters. When we expressed our apologies to the owner that we had made a decision to leave, we were told \"we turned away people because of you!\" rather than we're sorry or please come back another time. Needless to say, my husband's birthday dinner was celebrated at another Italian eatery."}
