{"text":"As a kid, I adored Silvioni's. My mother would take me there as we live very close when my father was on business trips. When I look back, I'm pretty sure we went for convenience and not for five-star food.

Don't get me wrong, it is an alright restaurant. However, this is nothing special.  I know the biggest turn-off for most people's will be that Silvioni's doesn't serve pizza. \"What! How could they?\" I hear half of you say. I know, i know. The other big thing that will turn you away from Silvioni's is their is a much better Italian restaurant right down the road not 100 yards away. This place is Monticello's, and yes, is does serve pizza. (I might do a review on Monticello's in the future). While the food is decent, you can always count on the service being friendly, you food being made speedy, and a good bar if you want to relax for a drink. To conclude, this place might be the substitute if the nearby Monticello's is too crowded."}
{"text":"The quality of this restaurant has gone way way down hill. I totally retract my 5 star rating."}
{"text":"had a family birthday dinner; old and a pre-schooler, were treated wonderfully; the food from appetizers to desserts were timely served and perfect: everything, from pasta, scallops and a child's plate to veal parm was done to order. The waitress was efficient, polite and prompt. 
All in all, this place is a restaurant worthy of revisits, time and again."}
{"text":"Great family Italian restaurant!  My dad's been coming since he was a kid and the food and service are top-notch.  Try the salad with the house italian dressing with a traditional italian specialty.  Or, if you aren't in the mood for italian, the fish sandwich (its big!) or the special of the day are always good."}
{"text":"Food was average at best, nothing special.  Not sure why others had rated them so high.  I had the Veal Marsala and the sauce was oily and drenched the entire plate.  Fettucini Alfredo was salty.  Nothing really bad but nothing really good either.  There are much better places to eat in the area like Rice's Roadhouse on Babcock Blvd. or even Olive Garden in McIntyre Square."}
{"text":"Always great, friendly service and awesome food. The lasagna is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Super great dinner for lent.  We got fried fish that was delicious, pasta sides with excellent marinara sauce (meatless), and my kiddos grilled cheese looked like they actually cared when they made it.  Our waiter was attentive and funny.  We truly enjoyed our family dinner.. what a refreshing experience!"}
{"text":"charming restaurant!!! The food and service is outstanding.. restrooms are clean and plenty of parking. I loved the chicken parm!!

100% recommend ..."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Eggplant Parmesan  was burnt and the service was awful. Wait staff should not pass dishes across the table when there is plenty of room to serve properly."}
{"text":"Great chicken Romano and stuffed banana peppers!"}
{"text":"Love this Pittsburgh traditional Italian restaurant. I've never had a bad meal or service. The house dressing is wonderful. Alfredo sauce and marinara sauces excellent. Love the gnocchi and eggplant parm. You can't go wrong. And reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My girlfriend talked this place up and I was excited to try it.  We showed up right before 8:00 PM on June 14th.  The hostess looked at us a few times before finally coming over and just said \"Hello?\".  We asked for a table for two and she just dropped off the silverware at the table and walked off.  While we were looking over the menu a couple of the waitresses began complaining over who was going to take us while they were in the dining room just a couple tables away.  Then they moved their conversation to the back where we could still hear them talk about who would serve us.  They were talking about how the one waitress always stays late, the other one needs to get home for something, etc etc.  It was just an unwelcoming experience.  I would have understood their response if we walked in at 8:30, but we were there already sitting at 8.  We both have previous serving experience, intended to order simple meals and tip well - this is just laziness.  If you don't want to serve people at 8:00, don't stay open until 9:00.  Even better, if you don't want to serve us, don't let us hear you debate how it fits into your Sunday night schedule for the first 5-10 minutes we're sitting there."}
{"text":"Checked online stating that they're open until 10:00 pm.  My wife and I were in the door at 9:30 stood around waiting 5 min or so to be sat.  The waitress comes and looks at us, then at her watch or a clock, then again at us and says you know we close in 25 minutes?  I don't reply, she pauses for 30 seconds then says come on quick.  I'm like forget about it not with that attitude.

Worst service ever.  You're an Italian restaurant and you treat a real Italian like me like that.  Look I'm sorry you close in 30 minutes but I worked 14 hrs today and I'm not going to cook.  But when I do my pasta takes 10 minutes to make, so I don't see the issue with rolling up half hour before close."}
{"text":"Food was terrible, the fish  I ordered looked like someone's horse ate it and spit it on my plate. That's fine....but did I mention that it also tasted like the horse really did this.  Just horrible food, and the waitress was very nice... Just felt bad for her that she actually has to serve this slop with a smile.... Just save your money and go across the street to monte cellos... Your mouth and stomach will thank me."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place several times over the last few years. I've never had a bad meal or bad service. The stuffed eggplant parm is the best I have ever had! The lasagna and gnocchi are superb! The red sauce is fabulous!  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food!!  No frills but tasty!!  Friendly staff!!we had a party of seven.  We each ordered something different.  We were all very pleased with our meals.   I highly recommend this restaurant for anybody that love authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was delicious, as was the bread and buns.  They had no problem seating us at a less busy booth and the Italian casserole was divine."}
{"text":"Our dinner last night was reasonably good in terms of food and service. However, the Pittsburgh Italian red sauce food NEEDED a decent glass of wine to complete the experience. Unfortunately it's impossible to have a good wine with dinner here. The wine sold here is an indescribably undrinkable jug variety and they won't let you bring your own. The server and manager disingenuously claim that state liquor laws prohibit bringing wine into the restaurant, but even the severely uninformed know that isn't true. 

Apparently the owners have not noticed that all American sit-down restaurants sell or encourage table wine consumption. You can get a good glass or bottle of wine at all of the fast casual restaurants that infect the interstate highway interchanges as well as at the oxymoronic upscale burger places. In Silvioni's defense, they obviously have a number of satisfied repeat customers. However, to paraphrase Alice, there surely are a large number of un-customers who, like me, could be converted to customers if they could get a good glass of chianti to wash down that pasta. 

Arrivederci Silvioni's. We won't return."}
{"text":"Everything here is so delicious!  The baked ziti is so cheesy, and I love all of the pasta dishes.  The prices are reasonable, but it can be so hard to get seated.  Waitresses are great."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today and it was nice.  Not overly impressive (paper place mats that looked pretty generic, etc) but the service was good and the food tasted fine.  We had the eggplant parm & the grilled chicken salad.  It was one of those meals that tasted fine with no problems.  It wasn't overly impressive but the cost was fine for the meal.  We would go back, but probably only if we were looking for an average night out.  I wouldn't label it as one of those places you need to try."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Italian food and great hands on service.   Pleasant demeanor and quick with another drink!

Great chicken parm, veal parm, eggplant parm, steak salad, etc.

Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Pittsburgh! Homemade Gnocchi is amazing."}
{"text":"Ouch. Three of us went this evening passing up Bellasarios. Mistake. I had the chicken remand which was good. Wife had the lasagna which tasted like frozen. Son had some chicken, broccoli fettuccine thing which was ok. The meat sauce on the pasta side tasted watery and meatless. The bill showed almost $2 for blue cheese dressing. Waste. Beers were overpriced. Waitress was ok."}
{"text":"I've tried a couple Italian places in Pittsburgh and they've all been pretty awful. I'd gotten to the point I didn't think you could find good Italian food around here. Then a friend kept telling me about Silvioni's so I finally went along reluctantly to check it out. We got the fried zucchini as an appetizer, which was really delicious and I got the Eggplant Parm, which came with a side of pasta and a salad. It was one of the cheaper entrees on the menu at $12.95 so I didn't think it would be that big, but it was HUGE! Then I tried it and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and covered in just the right amount of sauce and cheese. If everything is as good as the Eggplant Parm, I'm going to be a very loyal customer. Overall the prices seemed very fair and I enjoyed the ambiance too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I recently came here for Mother's Day with my family. It was everyone's first time so it felt like such an exciting treat! The waitress we had was very vibrant and friendly. The owner was wonderful, came around to chat with everyone. The atmosphere is very nice and causal. There is a dining room on the one side and bar/lounge on the other. 

We ordered several different things and I got a chance to taste everyone's plate except for the lasagna but it looked good and very cheesy. For appetizers, we had the Fried Zucchini w/ Marinara Sauce. It was great! Everyone at the table's tastes buds were leaping up and down.

I ordered the Chicken Marsala and side pasta with meat marinara. That was ehhhh....ok. It's not anything that I would return for. And the meat sauce, you could barely tell there was any meat in there.

So here is why I really gave them 4 stars and will be back, the Shrimp Fettuccini Alfredo. I wanted to order it but was hesitant because there is nothing more infuriating than messed up Fettuccini Alfredo. I tasted my brother in laws and then I was mad that I didn't order it. HAHA! It was the right flavoring and consistency. There were only 4 shrimp but they were big. My brother in law was not satisfied with the amount of shrimp however the portion of Alfredo was huge, but he ordered more shrimp. My sister had the same as me but with Parmesan Risotto. That was a winner! I would have preferred to have that with my meal instead of the side pasta with meat marinara.  

I do recommend this place because the food is good and the portions are large. And I highly recommend the Fried Zucchini, Fettuccini Alfredo, and Parmesan Risotto."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday night about 4:00. There was only one other couple dining in the whole dining room. I ordered a jack and coke that was not Jack Daniels . I sent it back and got the same tasting nasty drink back. We ordered the Silvioni's fries. They were huge but mediocre at best. The service was slow and the wings were soggy.  Very dissapointing"}
{"text":"Silvioni's is a great little restaurant. If you're looking for a classic neighborhood italian restaurant, I think this is pretty close. No fuss, just food. The side salad served before my dinner was basic. A few leaves of lettuce with a bunch of other vegetables top, plus, tomatoes - in winter! (Tasty!) 

The fettuccine alfredo was delicious and flavorful as well as generous in portion size. Others in my party had the Chicken Romano, and the Italian Sampler (A combination of Silvionis favorites: meat and cheese ravioli, lasagna and gnocchi with our famous homemade sauce.)"}
{"text":"You really have to be careful what you order here, as a lot of it is \"old people food\".  Never order the fish.  Highly recommend the veal Parmesan."}
{"text":"After an evening enduring a suburban ballet recital of children and adults, in support of my 52 year old neighbor who takes classes from them (and who actually was one of three or four who were VERY good), we all wanted to grab dinner after the 'show', and Silvioni's was along the way and nearby the venue.

All I can really say is that it's the standard neighborhood Italian restaurant, with the usual prices, the usual offerings, and healthy portions.

Although the usual offerings on the 'specials' board for the night included a chicken stir fry over rice. 'Cause y'know...when I think stir fry, I IMMEDIATELY think 'Italian'...doesn't everyone?

The service was very efficient and pleasant in that quaint suburbanite way, and the atmosphere was very casual. My neighbor was concerned about being 'underdressed' having just come from a performance, but I pointed out the rest of the clientele which was all typical Pittsburgh 'casual' (which apparently also doubles as formal), and her fears were laid to rest. When she spied some of the hangers in the bar, she felt over dressed.

There were six of us, all ordering different things. One ordered just a side of eggplant parm, one ordered ravioli, two just had wedding soup and split a dessert, the ballerina had a grilled chicken salad, and I (since it was getting late) opted for the 'small' fish platter, which was fried fish, fries and slaw.

Everyone was happy, no one said 'ewwww', and the ballerina had enough salad for three days. My 'small' platter was actually rather 'big'. One large slab of fried fish, a decent pile of fries (and ballerina and I agreed that the fries were very good - her salad was also topped with them - but of course), and a side bowl of slaw. The 'small' was $7.95 and the large was $9.95. I have to say, for $7.95, it was a big portion of food. And the fish was good. Nice batter, good flavor, and accompanied by decent tartar sauce.

I loved the old family photos they had hanging around the place, and overall, it was very pleasant. It really is a 'locational' thing, more than a destination however. Family Italian restaurants have just kind of become that in general. There's no need to drive out of the way to any particular one...there's always at least one in the neighborhood or nearby. And they really are all about the same. Entree's range from $10 for a basic pasta dish, to $20 for a meat, seafood, or other 'specialty' plate, but generally resting in the $15 range. The only real differences between them would be taste versus value. I actually tend to prefer 'middle of the road'. I find high priced Italian to be absurd. I mean, when you're home, lazy and hungry, what's one of the first things you reach for to slam dinner together? That 99 cent box of pasta and some sauce, sprinkled with cheese you had in the fridge. So why go OUT and order pasta for $15 to $30 a plate?

So, if you're in the Silvioni's neighborhood, I do recommend it. I am not a fan of Monte Cello's, experiencing the one downtown and finding it to be WAY overpriced for what they give you, especially for lunch. Monte Cellos may be nearby, but Silvioni's wins in my book."}
{"text":"Went in recently with my wife, two sons and their girlfriends.  Around 8:30 or so.  Not terribly late on a Friday.  Wasn't very busy, only about two or three other tables.  Upon walking in, several staff, and a few customers, shot us looks as if to say, \"Who the hell are you?\"
     After standing there about five minutes, with NO ONE even acknowledging us,we turned and left.  Wound up spending a fair amount of money at a nearby competitor.
    Done with this place, and I;m not the only one.  Heard this from a few people, but decided to give it a shot.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner at Silvioni's and was impressed with the huge variety of items on the menu
Everyone was pleased with their choices although the sauce is a bit spicy
I will definitely go back again
Great food and a reasonable price"}
