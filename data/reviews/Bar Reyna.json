{"text":"I love Bar Reyna!! It is definitely one of my favourite spots in the city. Their cocktails are amazing and the food is incredible. The zucchini fritters are sooo good you definitely need to order them! Went there for a friends birthday and our server Brandon made the night so memorable. He was a lot of fun and very attentive. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch a few weeks ago (I'm late posting) and it was AMAZING!  Food was yummy, Spanish fries were to die for.  Service was top notch!  Very accommodating and welcoming staff. Tamika was lovely and helpful and Brandon was extremely entertaining and not bad to look at either!  Even if the food wasn't as good as it was, they would make me return!  In fact, going again tonight and can't wait!  My favourite new place. Oh, and adorable back patio area - perfect for summer!"}
{"text":"This review reflects the service I experienced while out for dinner and drinks with a friend of mine. It is not a reflection on the food or drinks (both wonderful). 

The servers switched in the middle of our meal. The new server was extremely pushy and kept interrupting our conversation to find out if we're done eating the food we were eating and if wanted more drinks (although both of our drinks were full). The place did not have a line of new customers waiting to be seated. The place wasn't closing until 2 am. It was 930 pm. Finally we were done with one of our plates and she took away all the menus as I mentioned I may have another drink. At the same time the drink I picked up, which had condensation on it, slipped a bit and she said 'or maybe not have another drink'. It was my second sangria. Shortly after we were finished with our food and my friend had a third drink, they brought the bill.  I asked the server what time they were open to on Friday evenings and she was very quick to say 2 am. So I remained quite confused as to why she was trying to get us to leave. The entire patio was still full with other guests and they were not anticipating more customers. I do not like to be rushed or pushed out of a place I am paying for a service. 

The experience with the server made the evening extremely uncomfortable. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the drinks and food I will NOT be going back to Bar Renya. God forbid they serve customers and let them enjoy the food and drinks."}
{"text":"To start, this bar is very pretty but not actually finished. There were air vents missing, no a/c, and missing tiles where the bathrooms hadn't been finished yet. We were a group of 6 for my friend's birthday gathering. The hostess was lovely. I have no complaints about her. 
Our server however couldn't have been more disinterested in her job. Not warm or friendly, seemed like she wanted to be anywhere else and couldn't wait to get us out. So much so that they cleared my friend's beer (that was still half full). 
Terrible, terrible service. It's a pity b/c the food was nice. Avoid this place until it either has better staff that actually want to work or it establishes more roots."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place in Yorkville! I spent a very happy two hours at the bar during their 4-7pm Happy Hour; which includes a number of items for $7, including Half A Dozen Oysters!!! check it out https://www.barreyna.com/7-dollar-menu/

I had the sauvignon blanc and oysters from the Happy Hour menu, which were lovely. Then I moved on to an amazing grilled Halloumi & Brussels Sprouts app, followed by a divine lamb shank baklava.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My overall experience at Bar Reyna was quite pleasing, which is what convinced me to dine there for the second time and be provided with exceptional service and food. This is a Mediterranean restaurant I'd recommend to those who prefer to indulge in some time inclusive of culture along side, modern contemporary space. The patio in specific is absolutely gorgeous! If you love cocktails, I'd recommend you try the \"Her Royal Highness\" to share with a friend!"}
{"text":"Went for my friend's birthday dinner with $50 prix fixe. The hostess was great and friendly when we walked. There are two main reasons I gave only 2 stars. 

The portion of food was relatively small for a $50 menu, we had a bread plate, one tiny zucchini ball/person, one piece of watermelon for the watermelon salad, one taco, a few bites of salad, calamari, fries, and a piece of brownie. Also, we have two tables, but each dish they bring us 3 plates to share among us, which means each table get 1.5 plate. Ending up putting one plate on the edge of a table and people from two tables have to share one. Don't get me wrong the food is taste good, but just not worth near $50+tax and tips. 

The service was unprofessional I would say. So we had the bread with 3 sauce on the side. One of the bread has sauce underneath it, with a little spill under. (Seem like they were trying to cover the spill with the bread) so I asked the server why is there sauce over this piece of bread, facing down? She told me literally they probably have a spill of the sauce on the plate, when they were filling the ramekin..so I paused. She asked me.. do you want me to bring you a fresh one then? Which bring me by surprise, it should be \"I will bring you a new one right away\", instead of asking me if I want a new one. Of course I said it's fine. But which restaurant that charges $50/person for bar food, covers their sauce spillage with the bread they are serving? 

I don't mind paying $50 for small portion quality food with great service. But this is nothing like that."}
{"text":"At first it was a pleasant experience. Food was great. Had the lamb Baklava and Spanish fries. It was quiet at the time, 11am on a weekday. My friend and I were the only customers for about an hour. The servers seemed pleasant and so was my friend and I during the entire meal so I was surprised and hurt when I ordered a take out meal for my husband (so he can enjoy the same meal i had). 

I recieved my takeout order. I ordered two dishes but only looked at the top container inside the brown bag they gave me and saw that it was what i  ordered. I did not bother to check the second container. When I got home I found a foul smelling half eaten spagetti with a fork inside. I don't even think they sell spaghetti  here. All I could think was 'why would they do this'? I was polite. I gave a decent tip. It was so cruel I was fumed by this for days. I paid full price for somebody's rotten lunch. And they concealed this rotting lunch by putting the right order on top!!! Did they spit on my food too?

I will never return here again!! I still don't understand what I did to deserve this kind of treatment. Was this just a cruel joke or dare? I will never know but I know I will never spend my money here ever again!!"}
{"text":"Me and my significant other reserved this location 2 weeks in advance for our 3 years anniversary. We came there and they gave us a spot under the staircase which was completely not advertised by the pictures here. We asked for a move and they moved us to a 4 person table. We then asked if we can be moved to the top floor - not possible. Can we be moved to the front patio - not possible. Can we be moved back to the back patio - sorry that's gone now. Horrible experience. The person we kept talking to kept changing everytime and the waitresses did not care about our 2 week old reservation."}
{"text":"Had a great night out here and loved the lamb shank baklava, Arabic fries, char-grilled octopus, and empanadas! I would skip out on the mushrooms on toast which was a bit disappointing. Gorgeous indoor patio ceiling and lovely environment to sit down and have a drink or snacks at. It was awesome that they even took reservations for Friday night. More pictures on blog: https://wywhitneytam.wordpress.com/2017/04/02/bar-reyna-yorkville"}
{"text":"You Heiness! Kicked my a$$! The drink that you can't pass up once you notice it at the next table.
Food was excellent and all wait staff were absolutely lovely! Will definitely be back ;)"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch. I would NOT recommend eating here if you are actually hungry. PORTIONS ARE PATHETIC - I repeat, PORTIONS ARE PATHETIC! I'm okay with paying for an expensive brunch if it's worth it, this was not worth it. I had the Reyna's Croque Madame while my partner had the Duck Benedict. First of all... the sourdough of my croque was so crunchy that I was causing a ruckus trying to cut the bread with the knife while my bowls were banging together lol. The taste was absolutely bland and they were stingy with the salmon. It's just one piece of decorated sour dough bread, I would have been better off making a grilled cheese sandwich at home.  I didn't want to ruin my date though since I dragged him here so I didn't complain. My poor, poor partner. The portions for the duck benny were abysmal. Literally two bites, and the duck was so dry. How's that even possible in a benny? While the restaurant itself doesn't feel pretentious, the portions absolutely are. I like to take photos of food, and lets just say that the portions were so sad that I felt it would be embarrassing to take photos of the dishes in front of us. When we left the restaurant we went to H-Mart to buy food to fill us up. The decor is very cute, and service is friendly and attentive -  but I don't want to pay out of pocket to sit on a bunch of pillows and eat less than mediocre, overpriced food from a nice waiter JUST so I can leave hungry. That being said, I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot! 

This Yorkville eatery is a Mediterranean haven of food and drink. The interior is meticulously, beautifully decorated and the back patio is literally an oasis. You don't see any of the street or city- only an open roof- so it feels like you've been transported. 

As for the food, I found it to be very well done and filling. My friend and I went for a late Friday afternoon lunch and ordered four dishes to share, and that was perfect for us. The eggplant byaldi was two pieces of pleasantly charred bread with eggplant spread, pine nuts and pomegranate seeds. The ceviche was a bowl of lime-dressed fish freshness with some surprises like sweet potato, radish and mint, alongside thin and crisp yuca chips. These two came out together, and then later we shared the zucchini fritters and the Reyna Salad. The zucchini fritter came as a quad, and were crispy on the outside but bright green and soft on the inside. Delectable with the accompanying roasted tomato aioli that has a bit of kick. And say what you will about not making friends with salad. The Reyna salad won us both over, especially thanks to the crispy shallot topping and combination of purple kale, fried chickpeas, cucumber, avocado, beets, radish, tomato, quinoa, brussel spouts and tahini dressing. What an action-packed dish. 

Service was lovely and attentive, without being overly so. I loved that we were nicely paced with the dishes coming out two at a time, and I never felt rushed. I merely soaked in the moment (and my sangria)."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this place. The patio is gorgeous and at night it is paired with live music which creates this amazing romantic ambience. The food is all shareable and quite filling so don't order too much. The only thing that wasn't great was the service, our server was mia the entire night, like it took forever to order, to pay, and to order another drink. But overall it was good, i'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here for a double date a few weeks ago. Was expecting a lot as it was pretty hyped up on social media. The restaurant is pretty and the servers were mostly friendly. The restaurant was way too hot tho and we were all uncomfortable and sweaty by the end of the night. Food was just okay probably would come back for drinks and would stay in the patio instead of inside."}
{"text":"The staff appeared to be friendly and accommodating but I quickly realized this was not the case. I was in town for business solo and was awkwardly reseated twice. I was moved to the patio as my server thought this would be the nicer experience for me. Unfortunately the weather was rainy and humid which had a negative impact, but I can imagine this is a nice space given better weather. I ordered a cocktail, then shortly after ordered an appetizer and entrée at the same time as pushed by my server. My hot appetizer was brought before my cocktail and my entrée followed within minutes - very poorly timed. The food was okay, nothing to get excited over - even after ordering my server's \"favorite dish.\"  Unfortunately did not have the opportunity to try dessert this time. If I'm ever in Toronto I'll return to try again based on other raving reviews and the very friendly and passionate owner"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed having lunch at Reyna. We were a fairly large group (16, I think), but they were very accommodating. I got a sense that they really *take care* of their guests. 
Sat on the patio, which was enchanting. Everyone enjoyed their food a lot. I had the burger, and for a small fee they were able to upgrade my fries to the Italian Fries - thoroughly recommended.
Even when we asked for details about renting out the upstairs for private parties, the hostess took the time to talk to us about seating and group sizes. The decor is really nice as well.
Only reason I didn't give a 5 star was that the food took a little longer than I would have liked, even though we said we were in a bit of a hurry - with one person's order (just the fancy fries) came out noticeably later than everyone else's food. Although not unexpected since we're a large group."}
{"text":"Food is good (small portions especially for shareable platters)
Atmosphere and decor is fabulous
Servers are nice

First issue, ordered a bottle of wine and after 30 minutes we still hadn't received it. Server said the bottle was being brought down from the attic... another 15 mins the server says the wine needed to chill. Sorry, but I didn't order a bottle to wait 45 mins before drinking some wine? At that point, why don't you recommend a different bottle that's ready to drink right away? 

Second issue, our server came to ask what we wanted for dessert and as I was in mid-sentence giving our order.. she turned her back and started talking to the table of people right next to us. WHAT?! I couldn't believe it. Mid-conversation of giving my order and my server turns her back and begins talking to other people."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at 8:30 for 3 people and ended up waiting for an hour and this was on a weekday.
The service was great though, as the owner offered us a pitcher of Sangria due to the long wait.
This restaurant is very small and most of the seating is in the patio.
The patio is very nice, though it felt a bit stuffy while we were in there.
The food was pretty good,one dish really stood out - it was the Cataplana.
The Cataplana is on the pricey side - $58.. But it's really worth a try as the seafood was VERY fresh. It's great for sharing and definitely a Must-have at this restaurant.
The coctails at this restaurant are very unique and tastey too, a must-try is the Moscow Mule! 

Overall I enjoyed this restaurant. It would have been a 5 star if it wasn't for the long wait."}
{"text":"This is a cute spot in the Yorkville area. The service is nice and attentive. I went with a group of 7 so we ordered a bunch of things. I found that the sauce for every dish is what really made it taste good, compared to the actual food itself. The zucchini fritters were pretty good, the Greek fries with garlic aioli and the Spanish fries with chipotle were good (was excited about the Spanish fries cause of the chorizo but wasn't as good as the Greek fries forsure!). We tried the Lebanese tacos which were pretty good, as well as the octopus which I'm not usually a fan of but thought were great. 

Then we got the burgers....which were cold when we got them. So we all weren't the biggest fans, plus nothing special. But our waitress was nice and she spoke to the manager and we got our choice of dessert which was nice of them. We got the salted caramel dessert as well as the bread pudding, both of which were pretty good (the bread pudding tasted like apple pie which I loved!) 

At the end of the day this place was alright, nothing special especially for how expensive it can be."}
{"text":"To kickoff my holiday dinner with friends I decided to visit Bar Reyna. I have a thing for nice restaurants and Bar Reyna did not disappoint. Loved the ambience , the food  and the location. The vibe is lowkey and exciting, not pretentious at all. I definitely can't wait to go back in warmer weather to experience their patio"}
{"text":"Some restaurants you give a three because it was good, but you wouldn't go back.  Others are a three that are good, and you would go back.  I would go back to Bar Reyna, especially from 4-7 pm on weekdays when they have a \"$7 for 7\" item list, that includes wine, cocktail and oysters.

I had already read that they tell you right when you sit down that you have to leave by a certain time, and indeed, they did this to me.  It doesn't set a good tone.  Woodlot did this to me about five or so years ago, and I've never been back, because it just left this lasting impression of...rudeness.  If you can't turn your tables gracefully on time, that's your problem, not mine.  Or, have it say on OpenTable the limit of the seating, so you don't have to immediately tell me the minute I show up.  It's just tacky.

They seemed all over the place in terms of service.  We had like 5 different people touch the table, one after another, asking the same questions.  

I enjoyed the red wine that was on special.  I didn't love the Greek fries, they were good, but more like pub food.  I liked the vibe of the place, and the room, and remarked to my friend it would have made for a good second-date place, where you can nibble on some shared snacks, have drinks, and I guess be out in two hours to go spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Magical patio - 5/5 on that for sure! Tried a variety of dishes and some decadent cocktails - no serious complaints here and a couple of highlights (e.g. zucchini fritters, grilled octopus). Super service and again, that patio is glorious."}
{"text":"I have NO idea why anyone would think this place serves GOOD food. Clearly those people have zero taste.  I came for brunch and food aside the service time was incredibly slow.  The waitress took forever to come take our order and then our food took well over 30 minutes to come. Not only that  they brought out one dish first and the other 2 dishes came about 10-15 minutes after. 

I understand that people love the decor here and I admit that it's SUPER cute.  But no decor can justify such poor and slow service.  I sat at the back patio and there were 4 empty tables, so it's not like the restaurant was at capacity.  

Anyway on to the food. I guess I was expecting the food presentation to be beautiful because we are in spot in Yorkville and the restaurant is super instagramable. But, it was super boring.
* Croque madame - literally just a slice of bread with smoked salmon and an egg on top and plain lettuce on the side.  $16 and I could've easily done the exact same thing at home.
* Duck benny - This is the description on the menu (8-hour roasted duck, potato rosti, cabbage escabeche, brown butter hollandaise).  Sounds delicious but this lacked flavour.  They used a bit of spice on the duck but zero salt.  Also they lied on their menu because I did not have a potato rosti.  I wish now that I took a picture because what I had instead was some fried sticky rice concoction.  I thought it was weird but just assumed it was suppose to be that way. After going home and wanting to check what the rice thing was I realized it was suppose to be potatoes.  LIES.  Regardless of taste, the dishes that came out were lukewarm even after waiting a minimum of 45 minutes for them to bring out all 3 dishes.  How gross.

My last complaint.  The americano costs $6.  Cool.

Please do yourself a favour and never come here.  Maybe the drinks are fine so you can enjoy the nice decor, but do NOT eat the food."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because it was the aesthetic was on point and really cute. We came on a Friday around 1 and it wasn't busy. We sat on the back patio which was beautiful. 

Atmosphere was nice and the service was great and very attentive despite the long wait for the food to come out. However, we were disappointed by the food, definitely not worth the high price for what it is. 

We ordered: 
- Greek Fries ($10): they weren't bad, but fries are fries at the end of the day. 

- Lebanese Tacos ($16): these were pretty good once you get into it and have a taste of all the components in your mouth. I enjoyed it. 

- Merguez Lamb Pide ($16): had no idea what it was but since we were sharing, we wanted to order another dish and the waiter recommended this saying he enjoyed this and it's simplicity.... ok.. When it came out it was rock hard and so dry. Could barely eat it, we were regretting the decision to \"try something new\" in regard to this dish and a waste of $16. 

Overall, cute place, meh food."}
{"text":"After telling myself I would never come back here, I ended up giving this place another try on Saturday night (it helps that it is conveniently in my neighbourhood).  We sat on the back patio - this time we were able to enjoy a beautiful summer night and I also noticed that the patio has a retractable roof (maybe they read my earlier review ...)

The menu was somewhat updated.  We shared the Reyna Salad (still dreaming about it!), chicken tacos (new menu item from last time), trio of dips (new menu item from last time), and indulged in the Reyna fries again.  The courses were well-paced and our waitress was attentive and helped us pick our menu choices.

I am happy that I can look forward to coming again and being greeted with great service and delicious food.  It just goes to show that poor customer service can really taint the overall experience, even with great food!"}
{"text":"Happy hour special on weekdays from 4-7pm with a $7 drinks and apps menu was worthwhile, and the patio itself is nicely decorated and hidden away from the crowds. However, having also tried the dinner menu, I wouldn't recommend the food and would come back just for happy hour."}
{"text":"Loved. It. Great atmosphere, great service, great food. 

From the moment I arrived through the front door, everyone that worked their treated me like a friend. The energy was so fun!

And the service, professional, fast and sweet. 

I cannot say enough about our server, I think his name was Fernando... I can't remember bc this was a month ago, but he was gracious and the consummate professional. I'll return for the awesome staff as much as the beautiful breakfast. Which was egg shashuka, it was heavy but not dense, the eggs were a touch hard but were so perfectly seasoned it didn't even matter. 

Coffee was the only meh part."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time one evening when i came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, when we were able to get a reso within like 30 mins. The atmosphere is fun, the tables are so cute and the decor is pretty. Service is absolutely excellent! They have a great selection of different Mediterranean inspired tapas, we had the greek fries and the jamon serrano, which was amazing!! We shared the grilled seafood special, and it was phenomenal, a little overpriced though for the portion. The drinks are also reasonably priced for Yorkville, and they have a great selection for cocktails and wine. Overall, I would definitely return, I can't believe i hadn't found it before, since I've probably passed by it a dozen times, as it is tucked a way a little at the end of the street."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and very iced/watered down cocktails that even a nicely decorated patio cannot redeem (and I'm a light weight drinker) If you must get that patio photo for the 'gram, go for a glass of wine only and then move on to better things elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here on NYE for early dinner (7-9PM) with a reservation and good experience overall, but noticed a few improvements the restaurant could make.

The pros first:
1. Beautiful interior design! Kind of bohemian, Turkish-inspired. Instagram-worthy :) Romantic, but no pressure to be classy, i.e. some people were dressed up but most were dressed down
2. The food TASTES great. Ordered off their NYE prix fixe dinner menu (starter, app, another app, main, dessert) for $55/person. There was a vegetarian option for each course and they tried their best to eliminate dairy by my request, but this didn't work for the dessert course fml. Their lobster and scallop skewer was AMAZING. I love seafood and I eat it often, but never have I ever had such wonderful tasting scallops and lobster - tender, fresh, citrus-y, creamy... Perfect balance of flavors.
3. Chill servers
4. Moderately large venue and versatile - has regular indoor seating on multiple levels, an indoor patio, bars

This would be a great place to have drinks/dinner with girlfriends or to bring a date :D

Cons:
1. Indoor patio was a cool idea at first since it looked so pretty with hanging sky lanterns and cute cushions everywhere, but it was SO HOT AND DRY (you can feel the heat coming from their ceiling heaters) and the roof is leaky. Unfortunately it was raining that night, so my back got a bit wet.
2. Dark inside the restaurant. Couldn't really see my date very well. Or the food.
3. Tables were REALLY close together. I guess this is what happens when a resto is pushed for space, but I felt like I was sitting at a communal table both on the indoor patio and later inside when we requested a seat change.
4. Slow service. It took a really long time (~15 mins) for each course to come.
5. SMALL portion sizes, I was definitely still hungry. Think quality for the food here, not quantity. Not sure if this was just an issue on NYE though."}
{"text":"First off this restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  The patio is probably one of the nicest I've ever seen in Toronto.  Very comfortable yet chic.

Hostess and waitress were exceptional, very welcoming and friendly, and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Never had water go empty and were always checked upon.

Food was great!  Octopus was delicious, but holy moly the salted flowers served with the dish and the jalepenos combined with this were amazing!  Never tasted something so good!  We had some beef ceviche and then the Cataplana.  Ceviche was amazing!  Cataplana can use a teensy bit more spice.  Finally also ordered the truffle aioli fries and it was ridiculously amazing.

Such a memorable and beautiful experience.  100% will be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Made reservations on Open Table for 6pm. Called the restaurant as we were running late for 10 mins (due to unexpected delays at the subway). Got seated and ordered food and a bottle of rose wine. The rose was not chilled so they had to put it in a bucket of ice. So we waited. The small plates came in (applies such as zucchini fritters, Arabic fries) within a reasonable time. Larger plates (octopus and pide) took almost an hour (from time of ordering) to arrive. While waiting, got an email from Open Table that I was a no-show.

The food was ok, nothing extra special. Worst part was the service. Our server from the beginning was never to be seen again through the evening. It's almost as if the staff didn't really care. I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bar tucked away in Yorkville.  Wanting to get a drink and small bit to eat late in the afternoon, this place was open and relatively empty (it was before the huge evening rush).  We sat at the bar and it's got that classic, vintage DIY kinda feel (just check out the decanter light fixtures above the bar)

We ordered wine, and they only do fries in the afternoon (we went around 4pm so before dinner crowd). Their fries are the kind that i love - super thin and crispy and so flavourful.  They have 5 spice varieties - Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Italian and Portuguese.  Each have their own unique spice profile and they make their own ketchup.

I ordered the Arabic ones - with za'atar spices and homemade ketchup.  Delicious - great for a snack - once you start popping them, you can't stop.

They have a pretty big patio out back (which of course we only discovered after we had finished and did a little exploring).  It's covered, but I'm hoping in the summer it's an uncovered patio!

I'm definitely coming back here to enjoy a few drinks, snacks and that beautiful patio! 

Bring on summer!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a late September afternoon. Patio was lovely. Did not have any food items so this review only pertains to the cocktail bar. Overall, our experience was quite disappointing. Cocktails range from $14-$18 which is comparable to other cocktail bars in the city. At the recommendation of our cheerful server we ordered an undrinkable $18 cocktail. Upon sipping, the only flavor note we could get was formaldehyde. The server did graciously replace the drink for us and apologized by explaining that all of their cocktails are premixed and perhaps ratios were off. Pretty unimpressed to hear all their drinks are premixed for a place that advertises themselves as a cocktail bar and charges accordingly. Certainly not the quality I expect when I'm paying those prices. For a great cocktail there are much better options in the city."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while walking through yorkville. It was a pleasant surprise! Very friendly staff, great drinks and the food was fantastic. I couldn't believe this place has only been open a few months! I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I made reservations on open table. The only qualm I had was there was no indication that we should request a patio table. I wished I knew to request it. The server said it's not guaranteed, but at least we would know to do that. Since we didn't do that, we had to sit upstairs.

Upstairs was nice! Can definitely fit a large group of people.

Our server was very knowledgable and helpful. I ordered the king author concubine cocktail. It was not too sweet and very strong. I liked it though felt it a tasteless.

We ordered:

Watermelon beet salad - the whipped feta was very good and the beets were nice and soft. Watermelon was in season. It just didn't have a lot of taste outside of the feta. B+

Reyna salad - a lot of ingredients. Never had fried chickpeas so that was a nice touch. I liked the fried onions too. It was a filling salad. I liked it. A

Lamb baklava - my fave dish! So so good! You get two small lamb baklavas -A+

chicken tacos - very flavourful and good. Another winner! A+

Halloumi - made with a slice of bread, Lebanese cheese, and peas. The cheese was delicious. Peas weren't that great in my opinion for a topping, but it worked. A-

Greek fries - wasn't anything special. Fries with feta and feta dip. Nothing too special but the skinniest fries I've been!

Overall, I enjoyed this place. Would come again and try out the other dishes and cocktails. This time with the intentions of going to the patio!

This place is a bit hard to find because it's small. It's right across Nespresso."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Yorkville (and not too far from Carole's Cheesecake!), this Mediterranean tapas bar is nice and intimate without being overly swanky, which means you can show up in a suit & tie or jeans and a t-shirt, and you'd fit in either way (in terms of mood and vibe, it finds a good balance between casual and nice-enough-to-take-a-date).

We visited (as a group of four girls) on a Thursday evening, and it was incredibly busy. Even if you plan on coming here on a weekday, make a reservation. Service was nice enough, though it did slow down once they got busier. Overall, the food was tasty, but portion sizes varied by dish. 

We ordered the following: Stuffed Falafel, Zucchini Fritters, Crispy Calamari, Halloumi and Brussels Sprouts, Lebanese Tacos, Reyna Salad, Arabic Fries, and Spiced Labneh with Pitas (I know... we were hungry). Overall, the food was tasty, and had nice depth. The Arabic fries were on the saltier side, but crispy and delicious. The standouts for us were the Reyna Salad (great textures and a multitude of ingredients), Halloumi and Brussels Spouts (very interesting and tasty), and the Lebanese Tacos (great depth, and a nice earthy flavour). 

Overall, not a bad spot in the area for a date or a small group dinner. Beautifully decorated. Keep in mind that the atmosphere is quite intimate, so tables are close together and lighting is quite dim. With tax and tip, we paid around $150 (no drinks)."}
{"text":"I work in the area and came here on Friday evening for drinks with a few colleagues. It rained earlier that day and we had requested the patio however they weren't ready as it was still wet so they seated us at the bar until our table was clean. 

They have a happy hour in which a few items including their signature drink, Purple Rain, are all $7. After 1 drink at the bar, we were moved to the gorgeous heated patio! We ordered the Greek fries to share at the table. They were delicious but portion wise, it looked like a huge platter, but that was because the fries were so thinly cut. Regardless, still was very tasty. 

I would def come back. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Bar Reyna, but it lost 3 stars based on the pretentious service, that was borderline mean. The food and drink is good. The review doesn't lose stars on that front. 

When I asked one waiter what the Mykonos drink was, he sarcastically replied \"it's a city in Greece.\" Thanks for pointing that out, as if I hadn't been there or don't have a brain. I was shocked at the level of condescension.
Never make a customer feel stupid. I was asking what ingredients were in the drink. Also, when I asked another waiter for some help, he made me feel stupid as well. Granted this restaurant is located in Yorkville, but regardless, never forget that how you make the customer feel (especially in the age of social media) carries a lot of clout. Customer service training is needed for some staff."}
{"text":"Went to the place for brunch. Ordered the greek fries, chai latte and eggs benedict. Loved the food and service."}
{"text":"While I will miss Caren's Wine and Cheese, this new Mediterranean tapas bar in the same space is a great spot for drinks and nibbles, plus they have kept that same fabulous back patio. The decor is pretty, our server was flamboyantly gay, the sangria was delicious (made with cava) -- this place screams 'Girls Night'! 

My favourites were: the eggplant pinxtos and the salted caramel 'cigar' dessert. Our neighbouring table's beef tartare in little cones looked intriguing. Next time. 

Fun vibe for a chill evening and no Yorkville attitude/pretense."}
{"text":"Excellent food and location! Best dishes of the evening: Beef tartare cones, zucchini fritters, and the octopus. Went with a small group of people and, as expected, very quickly the cost of our meal starts adding up. Tapas dishes bring 2 small pieces, so you have to order multiples in order for everyone to try. Great ambiance and service, I even brought my 2 year old, and we had a good time. The patio is lovely, but unfortunately it was already booked. Make sure to reserve as this will be a hot destination in the summer."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a birthday and while the atmosphere and decor was very nice, the food was pretty mediocre (though the sea bass guac and chips were tasty)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Bar Reyna is a beautiful tapas bar in Yorkville. I seriously love the interior design of this place and the ambience in the evening is perfect for a date or catching up with friends. I already know that I'll be back to hang out in their patio when summer hits!

My friends and I came here on St. Paddy's Day for dinner and drinks. We ordered the grilled octopus, spanish fries, lamb baklava and pumpkin labneh. The best tasting of the bunch were the octopus (so good with that sauce!) and the lamb baklava, which really was stuffed with a good portion of lamb and had a crispy shell. The spanish fries (a bit on the cold side by the time we got it), empanadas and pumpkin labneh were okay but I had higher expectations. Despite this, I would still come back to try other tapas dishes here and maybe even brunch items if I can manage to get up early enough on a weekend! 

Drinks were good - I got the Spanish Kiss and my friend got one of the Stella beers. They have a good selection of different drinks that it was hard to make a choice!

Service was great. Our server was eccentric, attentive and witty lol good times with him! Good food, drinks and company here and will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad at all, but I think slightly overpriced for what you get. However the decor and the service were excellent. I sat at the back and it's really pretty, but when it is cold outside, they turn on heaters that are too close for comfort. I felt really hot while they were on, and felt cold when they were off. That was unfortunate.

I will come back though because the fries look really good and the area is nice."}
{"text":"I'll have to say that my review and 4 stars on this place is based solely on the experience with my server and the ambiance. 

First thing - beautiful restaurant! I absolutely loved the decor from the lighting to the napkin rings and the colours. We did not get to sit in their indoor patio but our server insisted on us taking a peek before we left - gorgeous spot! Definitely nice for groups and for a date. 

Service - our server was extremely friendly. We only ordered 3 dishes ($30 before tax): trio dip (pretty decent, nice to share), Italian fries and Greek fries. I thought the fries were a bit too skinny for my liking but it was nice since we weren't too hungry. The server never made us feel bad for not ordering drinks or meals and she was great giving us recommendations. 

If you're feeling hungry, I would avoid as the dishes are Tapas style and meant to be shared. But for drinks I would definitely come back - especially for the cute indoor patio!"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend with two of my girlfriends after we went to check out something for Luminato. We had attempted to make reservations online the night before but weren't successful so decided to show up and see if the staff could fit us in. They were super accommodating and even were able to fit us onto their super cute patio in the back, just giving us a head's up that the table needed to be turned by 7:45 PM. No problem by us!

As many people have mentioned: the restaurant (and the back patio) is pretty epic. It's tucked away and gorgeously designed. The hidden patio space is the true showstopper here. With tables built around the trees in the back, so they have become living fixtures and wooden walls with soft lights. It has a vintage feel and is perfect for cocktails with friends.

We decided to share a bunch of dishes together, as we figured this was the best bang for our buck. The restaurant is a Mediterranean tapas bar, so we figured 4 or 5 dishes between three pals would be just what we needed. We ended up ordering the Greek fries ($10), Crispy Calamari ($10), Halloumi Souvlaki ($13), Lamb Shank Baklava ($10) and Seabass Guacamole ($15). Everything was tasty and well done. Our service was quick and attentive. When we originally sat down, we told our server that we would likely need lots of water and our server was totally on point even though each of us had ordered cocktails. 

We never felt like we were being over-served and all of us left feeling like we had more than enough to eat. We had such a great experience and would 100% return back."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here for a bridal shower and had an incredible time. The atmosphere was great, the food was delicious, and most importantly the service was impeccable!! Jamie was a blast - so accommodating and happy to help us! I will definitely be coming back after such an amazing time! And the sangria was one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Very cool vibe and atmosphere. Not the most vegetarian friendly place for food, but they have a few great vegetarian appetisers.  The eggplant one was great. As for drinks I was disappointed with the old fashioned. I've definitely had better. They have a nice little wine selection as well. I would try again, as I think this place has potential."}
{"text":"I saw some fantastic pictures of this place and decided to bring my friend here for his birthday dinner. The vibe of the patio in the back was very good but it was extremely hot with no fans or any air flow since its enclosed by two buildings. We ordered the Cataplana, zucchini fritters, and eggplant byaldi along with a pitcher of sangria. The Cataplana was mediocre and didn't taste like it was anything special nor did it look like the pictures posted by other people (it was as if the chef cut back on some ingredients this time around) and it was definitely not worth the value. I was quite disappointed that out of our entire meal, only the eggplant byaldi was memorable. It's very unlikely I would return to this place."}
{"text":"Came here the other night and loved the ambience. Very pretty.. especially on the back patio. The shoestring fries were delicious as well as some of their other apps. It can be a bit pricey but the 4-7pm specials are totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Bar Reyna is a unique, cool, and intimate restaurant and bar. A great place to experience with a special person or a close group of friends. Definitely a place that impresses.

I arrived at Bar Reyna around 10pm and it was close to empty. Unfortunately, the patio was closed since it was pretty cool but it looked romantic and a nice place to relax. I spent my time at the bar and ordered their Greek Reyna Fries and an Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned tasted fine. The Greek Reyna tasted pretty good compared to other greek fries I've tried. I'll definitely try the other Reyna fries they offer.
                                                      
If I had to choose the one thing that defined Bar reyna, it would have to be it's entire environment which tempts you to just slow down and take your time eating your food or drinking or drink and cherish the time you are spending with whoever.

The menu may be pricey but you need to consider that it's located within Yorkville. I will most likely be back to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Bar Reyna is a beautiful tapas bar in Yorkville. Their back patio is totally IG-worthy with string lights and circular lanterns below a sun roof. The food was decent but I can't say that it was mind blowing especially with the price. If you're coming, I would recommend the zucchini fritters and charred octopus"}
{"text":"Had the zucchini, shrimp and chicken which were really good!  Service was okay drinks were okay as well.  Beautiful atmosphere great to go in groups or a date.  Whole menu is shareable."}
{"text":"Tried the Greek fries and Lebanese tacos, both were delicious. We also had the Reyna salad which was better than expected. The potions looked small but after trying out the dishes we were all full and had leftovers. They didn't have the seafood dishes when we came which was a bummer. 
For drinks, we had sangria, mojito and 3 beers. Surprisingly for 4 ppl all the food and drinks came to under $200, which is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Beautiful bar/restaurant, perfect for instagram and \"aesthetics\" - $7 menu items are great. However, service was a bit slow and food was OK."}
{"text":"I tried out this place for the first time and the service was impressive. The decor is lovely and there are heaters placed in the covered patio. They need to control the temperature better though. At the beginning it was so warm and when they turned off the heaters we were cold. It got pretty busy on a Thursday night, but noise level isn't bad. Be prepared to spend a lot her.A glass of French Rose wine is $14. I recommend the grilled octopus and Halloumi, which are both the popular dishes."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 7 to celebrate a friend's going away party. We were day on the upper floor and it was quite empty ..maybe only 1 or 2 other groups were seated around 630pm.

We ordered the happy hour snacks, which were $7/plate. We got the fries, calamari and zucchini fritters to start, and they were all amazing. 2 of each of those for 7 people was great to start. We then got a hummus plate and a souvlaki plate as well, which were also quite good. 

The servers were very, very attentive, and the drinks and food all came up very quickly.

10/10 would come back here."}
{"text":"We went for a date, but unfortunately left very disappointed. We were sent to a table in the back, told we would have to clear out in an hour for a reso, then no one came near the back of the restaurant for 15 full minutes. We decided to leave, they were apologetic but I didn't really want to stick around to see if their service would improve as an afterthought. 

We were also under the impression that they offered buck a shuck in Tuesday's but I don't think this is the case anymore regardless of their website... again, there was no one to inform us otherwise. The same goes for other elements on their website that were not reflected in the menus we were given. I wouldn't believe much of their website if you're looking for accurate information. 

It's a beautiful atmosphere and would have made for a great date night but there are far too many amazing restaurants in this city to spend time at one that falls short. 

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Bar Reyna'd been on my radar for a while thanks to their unusual menu, so I was excited to sit down and try their brunch offerings. I wasn't disappointed.

After trying to decide between the Qatayef Pancake and the Breakfast Spanish \"Poutine\" I finally elected to go with the latter (because who can say no to anything with the word poutine in it, am I right?)

The dish, which is described thusly: \"shoestring fries, chorizo chunks, manchego, fried egg,\" is actually quite impressive to behold, as it arrives as a mountain of shoestring fries topped with the aforementioned egg and littered with chorizo pieces.

It's a very, very tasty dish, although I think calling it a poutine is a little misleading. Though it comes with a small bowl of a zesty dipping sauce, it's actually a very dry plate of food. But the quality of the fries and chorizo compensates, as does the perfectly cooked egg sitting atop the whole thing.

I do have a couple of complaints, though: I was disappointed to note that the dish didn't arrive at the table hot, as though it had been sitting there for a while before being brought over to the table. Also, the whole thing is incredibly salty; between the salty fries, the salty sausage, and the salty cheese, the dish really could've used something to cut through the salt. (Maybe some kind of hollandaise or other breakfasty sauce?)

Still, despite these issues, I did enjoy my meal and I will certainly be returning to try some of the joint's other offerings."}
{"text":"Heh, someone's feeling butthurt, it seems.

Maybe next time cater to your customers actually want instead of what you think they \"should\" want.

Turn the bloody music down and let people eat and talk in peace."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their fries!! Which is inspired by the Mediterranean and comes in five flavors. We ordered the Spanish one which had chorizo and chipotle aioli sauce. Really tasty fries. The only downside is because the fries are so finely shredded, the tendency to overfry the fries is high. There were some fries which were over fried. It was a good dish to share nonetheless. Each fries dish is $10 though so I'd say it's a moderate price point for this restaurant. 

I also tried the Reyna salad and lamb shank baklava as well. The Reyna salad was alright, I liked the baklava more. The baklava has the right crunch and the lamb wasn't too gamy. 

Ambiance is really nice here. I was seated in the back of the restaurant where they changed the patio space into a beautiful sight. Lots of lanterns hang from the window ceilings and there are lights that hang from one end to the other. I can imagine how pretty it would be at night when all the lights turn on. Really beautiful!

Last tip?!

This restaurant has a great ambiance to throw a party, birthday gathering or a celebration. The patio space in the back or upstairs are big enough to throw a party for 30-40 ppl so don't forget about this space when you're throwing a get together with friends and family. Definitely will try the other tapas dishes if I were to come back for more like the zucchini fritters or caponata."}
{"text":"Just because it's in Yorkville and is nicely decorated, doesn't mean the food is good!

This is a tapas/bar with a very nicely decorated interior, spread over 2 levels and has outdoor patio seating. My group were seated upstairs - do note the inside of this place isn't very big at all, and if you have a large group, they can probably squeeze ~12 people max, or book out the whole place lol.

Anyway, ordered a bunch of dishes - calamari, dip trio, arabic fries, lamb shank baklava, and Lebanese tacos. Honestly nothing out of this group tasted amazing at all - which honestly was quite disappointing. On top of that, this was so overpriced for the portion you're getting.

1. Dip trio - this platter cost $15 for 3 square inches (not even exaggerating the size) of measly dip and burnt toast and veggies. A trip to Whole Foods would've been more worthwhile.

2. Arabic Fries - or maybe any fries here in general - I don't get the hype. They basically served us Hickory sticks in a fancy box for $10

3. Lebanese tacos - menu states crispy onions but the shallots were soggy - also this tiny thing was $8/piece! PASS.

Overall the only redeeming factor was edible calamari, clean and beautiful interior, and okay service. Take your Instagram shots here but take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and delicious food!  Love their food so much, I couldn't be more excited to have them at Assembly Chefs Hall. I can't get enough of their tacos!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent brunch here and haven't felt this good in a while this place quenched my appetite AND lifted my spirit. I came at around noon on a Saturday and at first when the hostess asked if I wanted the patio I wasn't sure because it was a bit chilly out but she saw my thinking face and said its heated and I was sold. And I DO NOT regret that decision at all. The patio is GORGEOUS it's literally an oasis of serene beauty. The benches were so cozy with cute pillows all over and COZY BLANKETS even better than ones at my house (I need to go get these cozy soft blankets for myself). The hanging lights from above and lights wrapped round trees with the cool patterns and potted hanging plans made it magical. there were only 4 other people there so it was pretty quiet and perfect for me as I was here solo and was gonna take it chill and sip some tea and read a book. Actually I wasn't going to get the tea but I'm a sucker for marketing and bcos there was a special queen's tea blend I got that and was very happy with my choice perfect for a chilly sat afternoon. The tea came in a super adorable tea pot with the cup as the bottom...only issue is it's form over function and I couldn't find a way to pour it without spilling. The owner who came to serve the pancakes said she realized that after she bought it. She said \"I like pretty things\" which implied it was pretty but not as functional and she said she is going to buy new ones soon lol. I complimented her on how beautiful this place was and how it majorly lifted my spirits and made me so happy which it did. I ordered the Qatayef pancakes and this is taking pancakes to a new direction I've never experienced before and was so happy I ordered it. The pancakes were a bit crispy which was nice and still fluffy. The ashta cream I don't even know what that means but it was so smooth! Not too sweet and perfect blend for the blueberry compote. And, what? FRESH MINT on this? Whose genius idea was this? You know those meals that makes you happy from beginning to end? This was it. If only this wasn't a real restaurant I would have just sprawled out on the bench and cozy up with my book and drink their teas and eat their food all day. I'll have to go back to try their selection of fries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for their 4-7pm, $7 for 7 menu, because otherwise you're paying \"Yorkville\" prices. 

The food: Their twist on the The Eggplant Byaldi ($8) includes a smokiness from the eggplant paste, a slight sweetness from the speckles of pomegranate and a buttery taste from the pine nuts. Great combination. The Spinach and Feta Borek was fresh as expected, by dipping it in the whipped honey yogurt made it much more \"Greek.\" The Zucchini Fritters you can skip. Goat Cheese was great. Shoestring fries with rosemary / aioli are also good to pick at, as you sip on some fancy cocktails. 

The Drinks: they switch up their cocktail list up on a weekly basis, I was never disappointed. 

I didn't spend any time inside the resto, I headed straight to the beautiful back patio. It's feminine and festive with lights dangling like gems. It cozy and airy. It fits the Mediterranean theme and it feels like a hidden snack bar gem."}
{"text":"Very chic and inviting atmosphere! The food was delicious and the cocktails absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday celebration with friends and had a great time! Right in the heart of Yorkville, Bar Reyna (meaning queen in Spanish) is a welcomed new addition to a number of fantastic restaurants in the area. It's a cozy tapas joint, that has an equally well-decorated interior and exterior. I believe the quote of the night was, \"This is a very Instagram-worthy restaurant.\" I made reservations for the back patio and it did not disappoint! We were seated at a table with a back bench covered with a colorful array of pillows. Aesthetically, everything was on point. But more importantly, so was the food! 

I was a bit worried that it would be a bit too expensive but since we shared a bunch of mains, we didn't have a heart attack when the bill came. We ended up trying the steak tartar (good flavors but came out a bit lukewarm), the Spanish fries (chorizo was a bit burnt but otherwise solid) and the cataplana. I love, love, love seafood so I had to try this. It came with clams, shrimp, mussels, and a large piece of lobster cooked perfectly in this delicious broth. So simple and well done. The seafood was so fresh, I'm drooling just thinking about it. 

I would definitely go back and try their other dishes, everything seemed so unique, and I'm going to add it to my food list to try Her Royal Highness, (their infamous $30 dollar cocktail served in a golden pineapple) for when I'm feeling extravagant. 

RIght now they are running a summer promotion where you can order 3 appetizers and a beer for $20 dollars so I would go check it out! I highly recommend this place if you want to get together with friends for a drink or for a girl's brunch. It is beautiful and the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Bar Reya is in a great area, and has a great atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and we ordered a bunch of dishes to be shared. The reyna salad was SO good, and the eggplant and goat cheese toasts were great as well. The falafel bowl was OK and could have benefited   from some sort of dressing (it lacked flavor.) The menu was definitely on the pricier side, especially for portion size. It was very hot inside (especially because we ate upstairs,) and there were fruit flies around our table for the whole meal. Once this place works out some of it flaws, I think it could be great!"}
