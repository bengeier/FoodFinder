{"text":"Location: Isn't doing it any favors.

Service: Satisfactory to Good. This is quite simply a byproduct of the small size of the establishment. When the place gets busy things start to unravel ever so slightly but because it's a small restaurant you are forced to provide prompt and courteous service or face the wrath of your clientel (your always within earshot).

Food: Satisfactory. Your kidding yourself if you think this is \"good\" middle-eastern food.

The restaurant itself has changed hands about 8 times over the last 10 years which should speak volumes about it's success."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem! Kruzo was introduced to me by a friend and ever since then, I've been hooked. The place isn't much to look at, however, they make up for it with the food. Been to Meron down the street and I'd pick Kruzo every day of the week. Try the mushrooms and eggplant as toppings in the Laffa, you won't be disappointed! The size of a laffa is larger than a 12\" sub so be prepared. :)"}
{"text":"Nice little, Middle Eastern place at a busy strip plaza. All the shawarmas are tasty and moist here, with just the right amount of spices. Can't go wrong with beef, chicken or lamb be it in a pita or as main course. All the main courses here are large servings and well priced too, especially when compared to other slightly more swanky Jew joints just East of this place. Enjoyed the shawarma and the Lula kebob. Looking forward in trying out more dishes, like the beef strogonoff served in bread or the Kiev cutlet. Didn't enjoy the loud Russian pop music and rap playing on the TV internet feed because I found it too intrusive for such a small place. Just invest a few million rubles in a modest TV package and screen some Jays, Raptors or Leafs at a moderate volume when I eat and you'll be golden.  Also, skip the mediocre, crispy but dry and artificial tasting garlic potatoes and go for rice or fries instead. Huge portions, good taste, competent service and relatively good prices - regardless of the crappy ambiance and decor - will make one come back for more when in the mood for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Just had take out. Had a lovely cozy Valentine Day dinner at home with my hubby.  I had lamb soup and it was just delicious. We shared  the chicken dinner with rice which was so tender and tasty, and it comes with salad. We also shared the falafel plate. They were nice and crunchy and inside smooth and flavourful. My hubby said his mouth was singing because he loves their hot sauce. Nice evening. Thanks Kruzo."}
{"text":"Looked at the menu before I went to this restaurant. Wanted Middle East Combo (4 Moroccan Cigars, 4 Falafel Balls And Choice Of 1 Salad) but they didn't have it. Got the falafels instead. The guy made it fresh for me, which was good, but the taste wasn't there (despite being freshly made!). I have to agree with others on the deco. It is a tiny bit sketchy. I felt like I've come to a closed restaurant."}
{"text":"went here just recently..  they have added a chalk board menu above the counter.

i ordered my chicken lafa to go. when it came, i peered into the bag to double check, went back and said to the chef this isn't a lafa. 

the chef said it was a lafa at first, i said no it's not.. then he clued in. he then admitted the oven is broken and they don't offer the lafa bread anymore?  i asked are you bringing it back?  he said yeah i know its a signature item.. but it didn't seem that they are going to offer the lafa bread anymore. 

not cool I had paid extra for lafa but got a pita. 
also they sell something to a customer, pass it off as something it's not and when approached admit the difference afterwards. 

the pita was good as all the ingredients are fresh, but not being upfront about the change left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"If you are looking for really good authentic Israeli shawarma- this is the place. They have variety of schnitzels and humus is just like in Israel. Staff is always very friendly, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Go here and get the Laffa. It's the size of a log and a taste of heaven in every bite. I live in Mississauga and still make the drive to Thornhill specifically to go here. It's that good!"}
{"text":"Greatest Shawarma i've ever had. My go to place for shawarma and just great food.
Amazing mushrooms must have in the shwarma laffa. You won't regret it and pretty cheap also 10$ for a huge laffa."}
{"text":"This place closes at 9:30pm on a Saturday. I'm not sure how that works, because most grill/falafel joints are known for the late hours."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a restaurant!  I tried this place on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad I did.  This is EXCELLENT shwarma. I tried is on the laffa instead of the pita and I enjoyed it so much that I would get it on a pita again if I could.  Laffa is a larger, slightly thicker, fluffy soft, version of pita.  They seem to be homemade and are out of this world delicious.  The chicken was fresh and toppings tasted great.

It came to $10 with tax and is enough for two meals.  I'm impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"I believe this place serves absolutely amazing food. My family has been ordering food from this place on almost every occasion we possibly could (we even had to take a break actually). We always order chicken breast, dark chicken meat and lamb skewer dinners. The meat is seasoned to perfection and the sauces that come along with the orders (white and red) are amazing!! 
Their rice is so tasty, as well as the seasoned potatoes. Mmm... 

The place is kind of small, so we've never really sat down to eat -- we always order takeout. The prices are decent and definitely worth it for the quality of the food. The owner, Roma, is extremely nice and goes out of his way to make the customer happy. 

Overall, I absolutely love this place and think everyone in the neighbourhood must try what good middle eastern/European food really tastes like. I hope that they will one day find a better location and expand...but still near our place! ;)"}
{"text":"The restaurant changed owners and name. They also completely changed the decor, which I am not a big fan of, it looks like Russian \"stolovka\" a sort of cafeteria for working class in USSR. The serving personnel also reminds you of these dark times in Russia's history, no smile, no interest no nothing, \"just pay and get out\" type of attitude. The Shawarma and lafa are still on the menu, so that is the only thing that keeps me coming back, although I am in desperate search for new place."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side - Kruzo is located in a nondescript, vaguely sketchy plaza in Thornhill. The proprietors are a Russian couple, and make the pitas with great gusto, but somewhat lackadaisical attention. Only chicken shwarma is offered, but what they lack in nuance, they make up for in sheer size; I felt nearly ill from how full I was after only half a Laffa."}
