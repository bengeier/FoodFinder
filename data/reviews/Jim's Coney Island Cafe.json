{"text":"Jim's was just what we were looking for on our way to the airport from a few days in Sedona and Scottsdale - quick, easy, very friendly.  Food was great diner food (coney island close to the spectacular ones in Detroit) - and our waiter was attentive without being around all the time.  Very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited me out for brunch to Jim's Coney Island Cafe.  I must have passed it a million times, but never really noticed.  The location is on the West side of Scottsdale road, just north of the freeway.  It's tucked beside an apartment complex and is a freestanding little restaurant.  You seat yourself with choices ranging from seats at the bar to cozy two-seater booths to your more typical larger booths.  There is even room in the back for private parties.  Once I found an open booth, I was quickly greeted and supplied with beverages.  We stopped in for brunch at about 10am on a Monday holiday, but judging by the depth of the menu, you can pretty much enjoy some good items at reasonable prices for lunch and dinner as well.    The cuisine offers Mexican, Greek and Polish influences.  I had to get the Greek Omelette.  It was a three egg omelette with large mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, gyro meat and crumbled feta cheese.  Side options vary from something healthy like cottage cheese to skillet cooked potatoes (\"house fries\"), which were nice.  My eggs were not quite warm enough for my taste, which I think had to do with the fact that we waited quite some time for the food to arrive.  The service was super friendly but not super fast, so I would come to this establishment when you have some time to kill.   Nice ambiance, thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by with my son after the zoo.  Clean, friendly and the food was good.  Portions are quite large, so definitely a great value for the price.  We will return."}
{"text":"I went to this place because I live across the street and didn't feel like driving anywhere to get breakfast. This place is just a regular diner but it's only open for breakfast and lunch.   The service was good and quick. Our waitress was very nice and checked on us often which was nice!  The food wasn't bad but the scrambled eggs were a little over-cooked and cooked with too much oil so it came out a little rubbery. Over all the meal was pretty cheap so I wasn't upset or anything.   I've found that there are no 24 hour diners in the area (other than Denny's) and this place definitely has that east coast diner feel so if it stayed open 24 hours I'd probably come here much more often!"}
{"text":"Great classic diner.  Nothing fancy, nothing expensive, just good ol' diner food at good ol' prices.  Hard to find these gems, but when you do, it's a great feeling.  You can actually eat here for under $10 a person...in Scottsdale...amazing.  Will certainly be going back and telling all my friends about it."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy going to this place. Really simple type of place with good food. We usually eat breakfast here, and really breakfast is so simple it's good. The only way you wouldn't like it is if you are a very picky person. The staff has always been great and friendly for us. The prices are typical for a breakfast joint. The chicken fried steak is better than most places. Overall a great little diner."}
{"text":"I love this place. A local diner with breakfast served til 2pm on Sundays. Don't know about other days. This is a great option to Dennys or a chain if you want to spend money at a local business.  Food quality is good and always consistent.  I've had all of the omelets,  the chicken fried steak and eggs, and also the waffle. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone could give this place a good review! The food was DISGUSTING! I ordered the mushroom and swiss omelette. The eggs were dry and bland, the cheese tasted like the individually wrapped kraft slices, and they used canned mushrooms.  My boyfriend got french toast, which was made with cheap bread and had huge clumps of egg hanging off of it.  The orange juice was the most horrible tasting juice I have ever drank.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill on a weekday morning while getting my car serviced up the street.  I walked down to this diner at 9am and had a great breakfast.  Thumbs up on the 3 egg omelette with spinach, bacon and feta.  They also swapped the hash browns for 2 pieces of bacon as a low carb option.  Good food.  Fast and friendly service.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted a new place to have breakfast on Sunday mornings after nights out in Tempe. I yelped restaurants down Scottsdale road and found this gem. The service was extremely fast and the food was really good. I want to go back to try the gyros for lunch some time."}
{"text":"Having recently eaten there several times, I can see why Jim's has such great reviews. I was in Phoenix metro for the first time and staying at the Motel 6 ASU in Tempe just a stone's throw from Jim's.  Just the same, I used yelp for somewhere close with good ratings.  Imagine my delight when I could look out my motel room door and see Jim's. The first time I went, my friend and I walked in 2 minutes before closing and were NOT given the bum's rush.  Awesome waitress took our to go order.  I had several meals there and everything I ordered was super good!!  Great staff, casual, friendly environment and good food reasonably priced.  What more could a guy want?"}
{"text":"Yummy, reasonably priced, friendly breakfast! Got our vegetarian omelet and french toast to-go. Everything was cooked as ordered and the girls working there are super nice!"}
{"text":"Very good service and food got more fries then another place, quiet place to study and cool atmosphere, the owner checked up on me as well nice guy. Must try"}
{"text":"Woke up after a long night of drinking and this was the perfect fix. The food was great, the servers were nice and the environment was friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch.  So many diners have such bland food,  but this was actually tasty.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Big greasy old school breakfasts for cheap in a old school diner setting... Pleather booths and a counter. a bit of a time warp. Nothing fancy but all good. A serious weakness for biscuits and gravy here, as well as the french toast. I have yet to eat anything but breakfast here, I must venture a Coney dog soon. No complaints.  Did I say \"old school\" and \"breakfast\" enough yet?  Biscuits. And. Gravy.... Homer Simpson-like drool."}
{"text":"Great food. Expansive menu. Comfortable place.  Dinner on the menu, but not open for dinner?  Too bad."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here before and stopped since I was hungry and it was close. Took probably 10 minutes to take our order and we were here for over an hour. You seat yourself and then wait. Some people nearby came in after us and got their food first. Others were still waiting to give their orders. Very poorly run diner."}
{"text":"A frequent stop for Mr. and Mrs. Q.  Whenever we have a light morning on the weekend we often visit this establishment for breakfast.  What I like about this place is  1.  Its close  2. Service is awesome  3. The Price is great but the thing I like most is the Breakfast Diner atmosphere.  If we live in this area for a length of time...Mr and Mrs Q will be a regular here and even if we move away to a different area in the valley we will always come back to our hidden Gem for Breakfast.  My Favorite:  Green Pepper, Mushroom, Bacon and Cheese omlet....with a side of Home Fries  (mixed with peppers and onions)  Delicious  Mrs Q.  Favorite: French Toast and Bacon.....But I end up eating half anyways.  Q"}
{"text":"I came here a few times for breakfast only. They serve basic breakfast food done fairly well. Their quality would not match some of the 4 and 5 stars that I have given out, but the food was good and the place is like a nice 50s drive in type. The best would be their biscuits and gravy and french toast. The biscuits and gravy does not look like anything special, in fact mine looks like it was going to be awful but it was wonderfully light and simple in terms of both the biscuit and the gravy, the only complaint would be very little sausage in the gravy. The french toast was well done, crispy outside, moist inside, only if they just use a little thicker bread to keep it that way but they use the basic slice bread so eat it fast before it becomes soggy. I also had pancakes which I thought was a tad too heavy and dry. I also had the corn beef hash, which is similar to other chain places which disappointed me a little. The other item I had was their waffle which is good and crisp on the outside but a little airy on the inside, would be nicer if it was a little more dense and chewy. Tried both hash browns and the country potatoes and they were well done, nothing especially great about them. Now I did not eat all of this in one seating. I came here 3 times, tried a variety of items and I would recommend it as a good place to have basic breakfast. It is a little out of my way but if I am ever in that part of town, I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for my first time for breakfast. Bacon was very very salty, potatoes were blah. Coffee was good. Over all fair at best!"}
{"text":"Having Coney Island as the main theme in the name, I thought maybe the food was going to be some sort of rendition of Brooklyn style that would be unfamiliar to me, as im from the NW. Admittedly, I drove by this place for a couple of months before noticing they always seem pretty busy. I thought they must be doing something right. I checked it out on Yelp to read some reviews and I became excited to try it for myself.   Walking in I was pleasantly surprised with the 60's 70's 80's feel to the diner. It felt familiar to me and reminded me of the best diners from the NW I frequented, family and locally owned (Im not a fan of the large national chains). The place is clean, it feels comfortable with lots of natural light, and there is a lot of seating. You can seat yourself at a booth or the breakfast bar... One thing I would mention is that they can be more welcoming when walking in - \"welcome, take a seat, we'll be right with you\" kind of thing. Instead of relying on a sign to welcome people and direct them to take a seat. But, it's a New York/Brooklyn themed diner, i dont think the people are known for going out their way to greet other people. What they lack in the greeting department they make up in the service. The staff is friendly and they accomodate special requests with enthusiasm. Everything is well organized and cleaned quickly. The food is always good (no exaggerated style of region themed food). Ive only been here for breakfast, but the menu offers much for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everything is very reasonably priced. Try it out you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There's a big sign that tells you to seat yourself. With four of us and more coming we went to a large round table. There were only about three or four tables with customers. We were told we would have to move because we only had four people.  All the other customers were couples but sitting at large booths. Just strange that they would make a big deal with the restraunt empty. I approached an older man in street clothes who appeared to be an owner. After originally ignoring me he said he didn't work there and was \"just helping out.\"  Immediately after speaking to him,  a waiter approached him and he gave him orders to do something. We ended up moving to a different table at US Egg and the meal was great."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here again if my life depended on it, a friend and I age here today. Not only could she not finish her food, but the food I did eat has made me incredibly sick all day long. AVOID!!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened back in the early 2,000s, it was called \"Crazy Jim's Café\" for a short time.  I even have a business card floating around somewhere proving this fact, so if you think I'm just making it up, then you would be wrong...dead wrong.  It quickly turned into Jim's Coney Island.  Some say Jim started taking Prozac.  Others say Jim thought the name might be too intimidating for the effete Scottsdale crowd.  I have even heard the rumor that there really is no Jim at all.  Whatever the reason, a diner by any other name would be as delicious.  And that's Jim's... whatever you want to call it. It's a classic breakfast/lunch diner.  I won't exhaust you with a boring litany of all the items you can get at a diner because if you have any business being at one, then you should pretty much know the routine.  The key here is, Jim has all the dishes you expect, and he does them all excellently, with huge portions and fairly reasonable prices.  If you want a gonga deal, then go for the specials of the day.  There are usually 8 or more items as a daily special, so if you can't find one there, and you have short arms and deep pockets, then read the sign and politely say, \"no thanks\" and turn around.  But I recommend you stay; and stay a while because Jim (or whoever it is running this place) and his friendly staff will keep refilling that coffee with a smile as long as you desire."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with friendly staff, good food, and a good atmosphere with a local owned feeling. I live down the street and had always passed this place by and now I'm disappointed I did, it's a really good place."}
{"text":"Old school looking diner. Hash browns were golden brown but we're really crunchy some parts were hard to eat. I'm pretty sure it was frozen before cooked. Scrambled eggs were good but bacon was questionable. Giving 3 stars because the server was nice and checked in on me every so often. Eggs were OK and toast was normal. I've had worst."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the servers were nice, but everything seems really disorganized.  This last time we entered and followed the directions to seat ourselves, but the staff kept passing by and not acknowledging us for some reason.  They weren't that busy yet so I'm not really sure what the issue was.  So we decided to move to the counter where one of the waitresses acknowledged that she had seen us. We got our menus and coffee after the move so i would suggest sitting at the counter.  It is a classic diner in decor right out of the late seventies which I think is fun and fitting for a breakfast place.  A bit slow on refilling your coffee and the hash browns need some help as they are pretty bland and need salt like the most of the food.  It's about on par with a Denny's so it's not really worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Always have to hit up Jims when we come to town.   Super friendly, reasonably priced and great tasting food."}
{"text":"I went to have Brunch with a group of 17 people from Church, who go to Jim's on a weekly basis.  Sat for 1:15 minutes aiming for service -- astonishing.  I spoke with the Manager, who also claimed to be part owner.  I was told \"I have no intention of sending anybody back there to wait on you.\"  Perhaps it was just set a bad day, but he was serving people in the booths, and at the counter.  I simply do not understand business management, or total lack of communication ...  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST PATRONIZING THIS ESTABLISHMENT."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience. The food is great, comes out quick, and the employees are always so sweet to our infant son."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's consistently good.  Today was pretty amazing as they were extremely short handed.  Literally one amazing girl handling over 30 customers by herself!  I sat at the counter and thought to myself oh shit, I probably won't get my food for awhile!  I ordered the Hungry Mans Breakfast and much to my surprise it arrived in less than 10 minutes and was cooked perfectly.  This is an old school diner type place built in the late 50's or early 60's.  Can't remember if it was originally a Denny's or Sambo's, but it has the cool old vibe to it.  Love it or hate it, it's consistent and good, yet quite simple!"}
{"text":"No frills diner. Nice and steady with a great breakfast special(jims special) and good coffee."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the older ambience at this place. Kind of an 80s old diner feel, but very clean and not dingy like some other diners of this sort. Got the Jims special with home fries... Surprisingly good as well! There are many other good looking things on the menu, but I definitely have to come back again soon to try! It's a great distance away from my boyfriends house to walk, see you again soon coney!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time I usually get the same thing not a place I would go to get upscale food but the people are always nice and the food is tasty"}
{"text":"Typical short order place. If your nostalgic this place hasn't been touched in years as far as the decor goes. I used to come here quite often with my dad for breakfast.   Decent place for some good short order cooking!"}
{"text":"It's a diner, not a great diner but a diner. Diners should give great value and great comfort food without fancy atmosphere not airs. This place gets the last part right but stumbles on the food and value. Why, for Gods sake, do you have a supply refrigerator in the entryway? So I can see how many extra bottles of keys up you have? I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for brunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Service was great, food was excellent and the prices were very fair. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"We love Jims Coney...killer 70s vibe straight out of Pulp Fiction....good food at decent prices.....Alma and the crew are awesome....i usually get the chicken fried steak and eggs and my friend gets an omelette with spinach and feta cheese both very good...  p.s. get the home fries"}
{"text":"I must review Jim's. the service is very friendly and fast. The food is awesome. And the decor is a lot more 70's..... Great place for a nice meal with friends and family"}
{"text":"Food is respectable, and the guy behind the counter read my cues I was In a hurry.  The young girl should not be serving customers."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious and the service was great. Only thing I didn't like was having to pay for peanut butter??? Seriously never had an up charge for tha before!"}
{"text":"Old school (as in '70s not '50s) diner.  Very casual place with specials written on a white board.  We used an entertainment book coupon Herr.  Breakfast served all day.  Food is what you'd expect from a diner/grill type place."}
{"text":"My family and I went several times while they were visiting from out of state. Each time we were greeted quickly, and had fast service. The food is pretty good, but most breakfast plates are $7-10. If they had a couple more options around $5, my husband and I would probably be regulars."}
{"text":"Really love going here - everyone is always so nice, and the food is delicious. Very cute as well, with really adorable booths. I love the cinnamon rolls, waffles, and omelets."}
{"text":"What a gem of a diner.  It's a total throwback and the people working here make you feel right at home.  I bet it's easy to become a regular after just one visit.    The menu is so diverse and full of everything you could want from a diner.  I tried the Coney Island Dog because I'm the only one I know who's actually heard of coney dogs and I so miss them.  It was pretty good, but how could you possibly mess up a hot dog of any kind?  My friend had some green chili omelet thing and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Mmmmm, some seriously good diner food!  The best part was our waitress.  She ended up reading our astrological birth charts right there at the table, just for fun.  She had the kinda personality that makes diners like this special.    If you're in the area and want a laid back, no BS kinda place to grab a bite, try Jim's Coney Island.  I only wish they were open later because this would be a great late night spot!"}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast after a few late nights. For days after my visit, I often find myself dreaming about the chocolate chip pancakes. Fantasizing. VISIONS.  In all reality, the breakfast here is pretty damn good. I order the chocolate chip pancake stack with a side of scrambled eggs and sausage links. This order brings me into a state of euphoria that often lasts for an hour after the meal.  If you wanna get your breakfast euphoria on, visit this place, but don't take any of my chocolate chip pancakes.  ...o_o."}
{"text":"Great food, great price!  Group of 5, we all left very full and very satisfied!  Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, all good.  Reminded me of food from back home in the midwest."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch. I had the Hungry Man breakfast and it was delicious. Wife had a \"Mexican Pizza \". She said it was also delicious. Prices are great.  Hours are M-S from 6AM to 3PM. Sunday until 2PM."}
{"text":"Went here today in search of some Coney island food like I used to have back home in Michigan. That was my mistake, nothing is like home but gave this place a shot anyway. I had a Coney dog and chilli cheese fries. Everything tasted okay but the chilli had beans in it which clashed with the fries, it wasn't much cheese on the fries. The beef hot dog was good and it did have a snap to it, I just wish the chilli would have been a little spicier. Overall it was fine but you don't get much for the price."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Everything I have had here is delicious.  The peppery gravy on the soft tender biscuits is something else.  Coney dogs - enough said."}
{"text":"We walked to Jim's this morning for the first time, after living in the neighborhood for 2 years.  The place looks like a diner from the 70's, which was cool.    It was seat yourself, and didn't seem very busy.  The place was very clean, and the staff was very nice.  We were waited on quickly, and our coffees were refilled 3 times during our meal.  Our server was very nice, and very attentive.  Breakfast was good, and reasonably priced.    I can give Jim's a solid 5 stars!  Keep up the hard work, and we'll for sure visit again!!"}
{"text":"We hit up Jim's after Pat's Run on Saturday and it was B-U-S-Y. That's always a good thing as I like to see thriving local businesses. It wasn't so busy we couldn't seat ourselves and slid in to a nearby booth. The decor is interesting and diner/dive-y ish but it was fun and whimsical too.   What I liked: *Great prices--as a party of four, we ate breakfast for under $25. That's pretty darn good.  *Decent food. Not the best egg white omelet I ever had, but it was adequate, served hot and the potatoes were crunchy. My hubby had a patty melt and he likes it well done. Sometimes it comes out like a hockey puck but Jim's did it just right.   *Easy to find location. Jim's is a few miles north of ASU on Scottsdale Rd. so it's *just* far enough away that you don't get the total college crowd, but still close enough that it's worth the trip.  What I didn't like:  *Waited a long time for refills. Probably because it was pretty busy but the staff came by to refill coffee but didn't bother to refill anyone else's drinks at the table.   *Waited a long time for food to come. Again, it was busy, but how long does it take to cook 3 orders of eggs and 1 patty melt? We waited at least 20-25 minutes for our food.  All in all, Jim's was a 3 star place. That's not to say I didn't like it or wouldn't be back, but I just didn't find it to be anything more than A-OK. I wasn't wowed nor was I disappointed, but next time I'm in Tempe for breakfast, I'll probably pick Jims."}
{"text":"Jims is a great place to go and get a greasy down home breakfast. The staff is great. We always make sure to sit in the same place to get our usual waitress.   Once you've gone a few times the waitress will ask you your name and will remember you the next time you go. We always go here for Mothers Day, which is alot of fun because I always get hugs from the staff. Haven't been in a while because I am trying to lose weight and this isn't the place to go to do so. But, one day I will be back, and I can guarantee they will remember me.   The only downside to this restaurant is the bathrooms. They are gross! And, of course, every time we go my 5 year old has to use them. We have gotten used to them though and tolerate it because we love the friendliness of the staff.   We have taken our family there for breakfast when they come in from out of town and they love it here too. It has a small town feel.   We have had large groups of 20 people, and they have a backroom that was perfect for that."}
{"text":"Pancakes were really good. Breakfast potatoes were just okay.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"It was okay. Portions were a little small and the service was meh! My steak was seasoned well I must say. But I wont come back here again."}
{"text":"Turkey burger was fresh!   Good service and cool atmosphere.  The breakfast menu looked really good too!  I will be back.  Ceiling needs to be fixed above the counter."}
{"text":"If you've ever told a great story to your friends about something crazy that happened to you on 8-mile, or know where Kid Rock used to live, or shwerved your hat, this is a place for you Motowners.    First let me say, that I love all things Detroit and the only thing I love more than my hometown teams is a good Coney.  Let me also say that I have ONLY had their Coney's so this review is specific to that.  Let's start with the place itself - located near the Tempe-Scottsdale border it is pretty easy to find off Scottsdale RD just north of the 202.  The interior is a series of bright yellow vinyl-seat booths with the brown formica table.  They also have a large private room near the entrace which seems like they host local groups on occasion.  They actually managed to recreate the feeling of an old-time Coney joint that I loved as a kid growing up in Detroit.  The place is festooned with Michigan stuff and Coney loving T-Shirts above the grill.  Next - the Coney Sauce - Perfect Bun - toasted - Perfect Onions diced - Perfect Mustard on the side - Perfect Hot Dog - Eh - looked a little skimpy.  The Coney Sauce - while it satisfied my craving for the \"flavor\" it was undone by an underwhelming hotdog.  I couldn't tell if it was the way they cooked it but it seemed to lack that \"pop\" that I associate with a real, down-and-dirty Coney Red Hot.    So I'll be back next time to try the \"jumbo dog\" with Coney sauce to see if that does the trick."}
{"text":"Been knowing of this place for years. I don't come as often but when I do I'm never disappointed. Great friendly waiters. Friendly customers that come in."}
{"text":"At first glance when I walked in I liked the atmosphere,classic dinner style,the servers were friendly,the owner im assuming was not to say the least,sloppy appearance,just looked down at me,didn't say a word,from what I could see he did nothing but get in the way of the workers and pull the boss card.I had a good laugh at this while I waited on my orders of there classic money island dogs.here goes.the dog itself was Vienna,woopie.they were not that big in size,they were all burnt to a crisp.but tried to disguise that with there chili and onions and cheese and sauce.the chili was ok.so not good,seemed like it was a canned product with a twist\"spices\".I wont go back for the hotdogs,but I will try it once more for there breakfast,id rather go to teds hotdogs.so stayed tuned yelpers"}
{"text":"I'm sort of a glutton for punishment for going back as many times as I have.  They have this one thing... it's scrambled eggs and kielbasa and vegetables and holy shit it's good.    But on two separate occasions, I came here and I straight up didn't get acknowledged, given menus or a chance to order.  Do you know how embarrassing that shit is to see someone come in after you and get drinks and their food order in before you've even gotten a menu?  I just came back on Saturday and we asked the waitress if we were going to be helped and she said, in a REALLY shitty way, \"That's not even my station.\"  So, fuck me, right?  Not your station, not your fucking problem?  Or... dig this, treat me like a goddamned human and say someone will be right with me.  Just sitting there without menus, without even a glass of water, not even a kind word, while everyone around me is getting taken care of?  Nah.  Fuck that."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of family trips to Michigan as a kid. It has all the hallmarks of 80s Midwest, from the dark Formica tabletops to the mustard yellow vinyl booth seats. The service was fast and friendly from the genuinely warm greeting that I received when I walked through the door to the heartfelt goodbye when I left. I kinda love this place.  That being said, the food which should be the star of the show really wasn't. The portions are small for the price. The taste of everything was good, but not great. I can't complain about anything, it's just not something that I would go out of my way to get.  If you are missing Michigan and aren't super hungry, stop by for a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Was here last week! Twice! This place is just like a good mid-west diner. Great food. Great prices. We had breakfast both times. The waffles are great so are the eggs, bacon, toast and everything else. The waitresses were quick and very friendly. I felt like I was in a true local restaurant."}
{"text":"Best service and great breakfast menu but I think the patty melt is the best I've ever had.  Clean and comfortable surroundings and staff makes you feel like family.  This place is addicting!"}
{"text":"Cute diner!! Fast and friendly service. Ordered the gyro. Super good. Fries were fresh and handcut."}
{"text":"My first meal at Jim's was over four years ago... i went to lunch with my friend Tom. It was love at first sight... (not with me and Tom; with me and Jim's!)  Jim's reminded me of the old school diner types of Coney Island restaurants I grew up going to in Michigan.  I had a tasty Greek Salad, warm pita bread, great service, and while Tom picked up the bill, I remember the prices being moderate.  All that and it took me approximately four years to return.  But I finally made it back to Jim's today... and it was just as good, if not better, than I remembered!  As a matter of fact, I may just add Jim's to my rotation for favorite lunch (and breakfast) spots in town!  Here's why: *Excellent service! Della was our waitress and she was awesome... she was patient with our party of four, she joked around with us, got our orders right, kept our drinks filled, and had an amazing looking green studded belt on to boot! *Excellent food with lots of choices! You want breakfast food? They've got it!  You want salad? There are several choices! Gyros - sure thing... and if you get a sandwich, you get your choice of sides including cottage cheese, french fries, apple sauce, tomatoes, and more! *Moderate prices and large portions! *Old school decor! *Comfy booths!  Thanks for sharing a fun lunch with me today, Brandon, Blair, and Lindsey... and glad I beat you to reviewing Jim's!  Let's do it again soon!"}
{"text":"Yelp's map is way off, but this place was worth getting turned around for.   It is south of McDowell, not north.   Most other patrons were locals, and the server knew their names. She was very nice to us.   The fiesta omelette is made with taco meat: yum."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why my husband I haven't been to this  place yet because we can literally walk here but we had a great breakfast! The short stack with eggs and bacon was great, everything was cooked perfectly. My husband got the fiesta omelette and enjoyed it. Old school diner perfect for a relaxed breakfast. Great staff and affordable prices."}
{"text":"The food and service have been great every time I've been here.  They have a really great tuna melt sandwich (which is something I'm always on the lookout for... A really great tuna melt).  I'm not sure how they stay in business, because there're never more than 2 or 3 tables occupied at a time.  It surprises me, because the food really is good!"}
{"text":"Really great food, old school atmosphere, quick and polite service, and awesome prices. A true American classic. I plan on coming back and coming often."}
{"text":"This is the best little cafe. My husband and I go often on the weekends. The breakfast is delicious, and they have very reasonable prices. They have a board with daily specials that rotate. Nothing fancy, just good food."}
{"text":"My husband loves to come to Jim's for breakfast. I think it's just ok. Standard breakfast fare, and it's edible.  The service is hit or miss, as is the cleanliness of the shop.   I typically just do an omelet of some sort, as the corned beef hash is clearly out of a can. The iced tea doesn't usually taste fresh.  The hash browns are usually cooked well...nice and crispy.    I have nothing particular to say. It isn't bad, but it isn't anything to write home about. Standard diner fare at a decent price."}
{"text":"I was surprised this was a restaurant. It was very good food, very easy on my wallet and like a nice mom and pop place. Great service. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The chocolate chip pancakes are a perfect mix and their bacon was perfectly crispy! Super affordable especially for a college student!"}
{"text":"Soooo greasy! All their food is pre-made and gross. Chicken fried steak was mostly bread. We also got the hungry man's. The sausage was meh, bacon tasted like it was re-microwaved, and the pancakes were dry and served with generic syrup."}
{"text":"Can you say 1970?  This is a typical east coast diner look and feel.  (Except it is a bit run down inside!)  Descent variety of menu items.  Food was average.  Hot and fresh.   Prices seemed a little high for the amount of food you get but then again it is Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I come here about once a month. This is a no frills, home-cooked, diner style meal. I've only tried they're breakfast and it is always delivered quickly and exactly how I ordered it. The service is friendly and the prices are more than reasonable. Every now and then you can find a coupon in the weekly mailers."}
{"text":"Jim's Coney Island Cafe is a step back into childhood. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that some of the newer restaurants may have. What it does have is quick, friendly service. It's clean and the food is reasonably priced for what you get. I never have to ask for a coffee refill. I love their home fries and hashbrowns. My bacon is always cooked the way I ask for it too. I've yet to try lunch or dinner here. Someday."}
{"text":"Stopped by Jim's Coney Island Cafe. I remember coming here since it was a Jerry's. I found this place to be family run, clean and the food was great. My server was very pleasant. I tend to support family run businesses because they seem to know what people want without having to pay extra for foo foo decor. Bravo Jims!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Water unfiltered, has nasty chlorine taste.  Table busser was in a hurry to take my plate.  I was still chewing my last piece of food n my plate was taken. Thought that was funny but also rude."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but very average at best food. Breakfast was your typical breakfast fare and reasonably good but how do you screw up an egg?  Nothing unique which is a shame because near old town, the competition is steep.  Update.....I'm moving it up to 4 stars.  It is what it is and I think they are fine with that.  Always super friendly and you can't take two sips of coffee before they fill your cup again.  If you are expecting some unique breakfast experience like some of the Old Town restaurants are doing, it ain't happening here.  But....eggs....French toast....basic stuff at super reasonable prices and a friendly staff....it's spot on for if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This was the very first place we ate the first time we came to Scottsdale and we have been sending people here for years but I think the owners have changed. The food was cold and greasy. The service was super slow and not even half the tables had people and there was a waitress sitting down playing on her phone throughout our wait. It isn't what it used to be. Even the burgers are bland and greasy."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took 7 years of driving past this place to finally try it.  I'm not sure I actually knew it existed.    Anyway, my wife and I enjoyed it.  We stopped in for a quick breakfast, and it was a nice change from our usual breakfast places.  It's a nice dive-type of diner.  Like a Mom & Pop style of Denny's.  It's definitely not like the trendy gourmet breakfast places who push a menu of healthy, fruity, organic, soy or granola on you.  This is a delicious and  hearty menu...  Biscuits and Gravy, eggs, pancakes, hash browns, chicken fried steak, etc...  Great cholesterol-filled foods can be found here.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good, consistent diner fare. The waffles are perfect, love the biscuits & gravy. The chicken fried steak is great.  The owners recognize you after 1 or 2 visits, seem surprised when i asked for a menu.  The eggs are always cooked to order."}
{"text":"Although Jim's isn't flashy on the outside, and scared me for the first few years I was here, I decided to actually go inside one morning I was completely impressed with the food, service, and diner atmosphere. Hands down, my favorite place to go after a long crazy night of partying. Fun to go with a group, or by yourself and sit at the counter reading the paper. Caution: I've never actually had the coney island here, so I can't vouch for it. However, I do LOVE the hamsteak, it is a great large portion is always cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Jim's, and my boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week. I usually get the biscuits and gravy, and my boyfriend orders something different each time. The service is always really fast, and the price point is exactly where is should be. It is clean, and the food is amazing! I love the biscuits and gravy - best in town!"}
{"text":"It's a diner. Good food, friendly service, great prices! I just moved to a couple of blocks away from Old Town - this will be my new \"go to\" weekend breakfast place! It's as good as Randy's!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast.  Friendly staff.  This place reminds me a bit of the back East diners that are so common up there."}
{"text":"Cute little diner with booths that look like they are from the 70's.  Very cute!  The diner was quiet and comfy.  We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday about 1:00 pm.  I quickly changed to ordering breakfast when they told me that they don't serve mashed potatoes and no soup on weekends.  I was super bummed.  I really wanted to try the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Instead, I had the Country Fried Steak special for just under $8.00.  I got the CFS, 2 eggs, home fries and sourdough toast.  The sourdough was excellent and they had my favorite mixed fruit jelly.  Service was attentive and friendly.  They serve breakfast all day and have a nice lunch and dinner menu.  If I could, I would deduct half a star for no mashed potatoes or soup on weekends.  Who does that?!  This place is worth a try though.  Good food and fair pricing."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal American dinner.  Clean, low key, inexpensive, big menu and excellent service!  Never need to wait, even during the busiest weekend brunch times.  The only con is they are not open 24/7!"}
{"text":"I spent half my life at Coney Island and wanted a NY hot dog. It wasn't here. Try Nathan's at the AZ Mills Mall...and even that ain't a Coney Island dog.  I seem to remember the very sweet and helpful waitress saying Jim wasn't from Coney Island, so I gave her a good tip before shootin' her.  Don't be fooled by the name. Looked like it was out of business last time I drove by. Maybe somethin' happened to Jim. You know what I'm talkin' about!?"}
{"text":"Lived in AZ over 25 years, and driven by this place for a long time.  Went here to give the coney's a try.  (What can I say I am from Detroit, and I hit Lafayette every time I am back.)  Hands down the best coney I have had in Phoenix.  Fries were excellent.  Service was crisp.  All in all Jim's was a solid experience.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a retro feeling 60-70's diner original. It looks like it may have been a Denny's or Shari's back in the day. For the age it is in good condition and clean. I like the large windows and the open feeling.  You can seat yourself and I was waited on right away. I ordered the Greek Omelet with home fries, coffee and milk. The food came out quickly and was good, it was simply done and flavorful. I read the paper while sipping coffee and eating, casual place with other people doing the same.  I like eating in owner operated diners like this over the big chains. There is a more interesting menu selection and you don't get the Grand Slam for all feeling. The service was great and so was the food, so I expect I will go back."}
{"text":"I went in today for lunch. It wasn't too bad for a diner/greasy spoon style place. Good for a burger or breakfast. I had a couple of coney's and as coneys go they were pretty good. Staff was attentive, prices were fair and food was good."}
{"text":"Simple,  quick, well priced,  friendly staff!  Nothing fancy but good for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating at Jim's.  We have been living in this area for 3 years and I cannot BELIEVE we have overlooked this place!  1.) For a \"diner\" environment, this place is so CLEAN.  In fact, I have been to other, I guess, \"more refined\" restaurant's that weren't this clean and well kept.  Even the bathrooms were clean.  They need some updates but I am not going to complain.  2.) The service was prompt and friendly.  Again, I have spent big money on meals only to get crappy, crappy service.  They aren't going totally out of their way here, but again, we got good, overall service.  3.) The meals served covered all the \"diner\" bases and what we had (breakfast and they serve it all day which means they know what they are doing) was great.  I can't wait to go back for a gyro (pronounces GIRO where I come from ;) and a dog. )  4.) The prices are great and the food is plentiful.  You aren't going to gorge yourself but you will finish just about everything on your plate and be totally satisfied.   I will be recommending this place to everyone who comes to visit me and everyone who lives around me.  I was so very happy with this visit, the money we spent and the chance we took going to a \"new\" place for us.    Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not over here very often but I always love dropping by for a late night breakfast or brunch if I can. Super taste diner food ^_^"}
{"text":"For anyone who has ever lived in Michigan the idea of a diner with Coney Island in the name brings up a particular type of restaurant.  This is exactly that type of place.  The decor and menu were spot on with what I was looking for.  I ordered a Coney dog and gyro.  Two things you will find in very Michigan Coney Island.  They were both good.  The service was both friendly and fast.  This place is a bit out of the way for me but it gives me the same feeling I got in Michigan so I will be sure to go back and bring my wife who will undoubtedly feel more nostalgic about then me."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite this morning, and was in and out at a reasonable pace. Greeted immediately and chose a seat... Immediately got an order in and didn't go a moment without a refill and the servers were such teammates. I asked the server who, was super efficient, if she was the only one on and noticed another server just as quick and urgent accommodating the tables. This place isn't usually empty, as it's a great neighborhood spot and family run- which I support! Most tables were taken, but looking around, everyone was content and had what they needed...The server noted they were short a server- but it didn't show. This staff was on it and not showing frustration or any sign of exhaustion. I respect that and appreciate it. The 3 front of the house teammates were working together and kept a good moral. The kitchen produced a great meal, and timely effort. I believe praise is important when people work hard. And it's so nice to be a receiver of the hard working efforts. Thank you for working hard... And please remember to always tip accordingly... This is how people make their money- in order to survive and live."}
{"text":"This place is one of those little old greasy spoons that's not a greasy spoon. You can get a great couple of cups of coffee a wonderful breakfast or you can have some ice cold ice tea and a terrific lunch even an early supper. The service there is great. The staff remembers you and when you come in they greet you with a smile. I take my elderly mom there a lot. She has had some health issues in the past, and present. One time she drove to the restaurant , became ill and the people from the restaurant in mediately took her to get comfortable and called me right away. Although mom no longer drives they treated us then like family and today four years later just like family. I've been going there since 1991 when I moved into the valley. While the food might not be five star the service and the kindness ,the location and just everything about this place makes it a great restaurant. It's always clean , the staff is always nice , the food is pretty good and it's very accessible with handicap parking right up front. It's stuff like that that makes this a 5-star place to a blue-collar guy like me. Thank you to the staff of Jim's Coney Island, Jeff and Annabelle."}
{"text":"Located across the street from where we were staying.  The service is fast and friendly.  The server took our order. Rib Eye and eggs.  Faster than getting a Big Mac at McD's our order was on the table.  Hot, cooked to order and very good.  Prices are very reasonable.  Will def. return.  Good vibe."}
{"text":"Do you like it when you sit at the counter in a diner and the waitress calls you \"Hon\"...\"Sweetie\"...\"Darlin' \"?   I know...I do too! It makes me feel like I've stepped back in time, to some mis-remembered past that probably never really happened to me (I may have watched too much TV many years ago...in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island, it seems to be in black and white, to me:)   After my workout today, I was looking for a good place to retox:)   I hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while, and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's:)   Jim's throws the love at you...in any other hands this stuff is just regular diner fare...you know, the blue plate specials...the patty melts...the ham and cheese sandwiches...the clam chowder from the big white one gallon can...the frozen chicken fried steaks...you know, just good, solid diner food:)   But, when they call me \"cutie\" as they serve my coney island and fries, it just makes everything...better:)   What can I tell you...I'm a sucker for flattery:)   That's not to say that Jim's serves crappy food and makes up for it with flattery...in fact it's all very tasty (including the actual coney island hot dog...not chili dog...coney island hot dog:)...but it's not really special food.   So, what is special about Jim's? It's the atmosphere, ambiance, the nice people, the varied and eclectic menu and specials (Liver & Onions, Greek Feta Salad and Bacon/Avocado Omelet, all juxtaposed on the specials menu today, along with the normal 100+ items on the regular menu:)   About the only thing I would add to Jim's, would be homemade pie...a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies, so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie...but that's a quibble, not a criticism:)   Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch, next to Hugh Beaumont, and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch, served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me \"good lookin\":)   Even if it never happened, that's how I remember it, Hon:)"}
{"text":"1st time here on a Sunday morning and were greeted immediately after choosing our booth ( self seating ). 70's style diner sort of retro that's what its supposed to be to the other reviewer who suggested an update. Basic good breakfast items served fast and all servers were smiling and conversational with their guests including ours. He made us feel like they were happy we were there, not a burden like some places can make you feel like on a busy Sunday. Will definitely return to try lunch items too."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast. Used to come here every Sunday, now it's less frequent, but the food is as good as ever. We never have to wait for a table, and the servers here are all really nice. My coffee cup is always full, which is a big plus. I haven't tried any of their lunch options, but I bet they're just as good as breakfast. My mouth is salivating now just thinking of the home fries.... Ask for them instead of hash browns. They ever disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is a very basic, old school diner. I've been here a couple times for breakfast and all I can say is that it is decent food at decent prices. I have received great service both times so I will say if you want a quick breakfast and you're in the area stop in to Jim's Coney Island."}
{"text":"This is near my girlfriend's house or I bet I'd never go here. The food is typical diner fare but what floors me is how long we had to wait. We've gone twice now on Saturday late mornings and it's never busy, which bothers me that it takes so long. The first time it took 20 minutes to get our food and there were people only at maybe 4 tables. The breakfast food was very standard. The second time there were people at two tables. The food was piping hot and came quickly but when it was time to leave we couldn't find our waiter and had to wait 10 minutes. Finally we went up to pay at the cashier and she went to find our waiter who screwed up the checks three times before we could finally pay."}
