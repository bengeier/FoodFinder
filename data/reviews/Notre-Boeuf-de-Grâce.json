{"text":"This is my second trip to this place.  Burgers are good.  I tried the veggie burger this time.  I enjoyed it.  However, the service was remarkably slow dor a Thursday night at 5pm.  I ordered my food about 5 minutes after everyone else at my table.  They all got their drinks, but I didn't get mine.  After about 20 minutes (maybe more) I flagged down our waiter and told him to cancel my drink.  He brought it to me on the house, which was nice.  My food also came much longer after the rest of the people I was with.  I had to ask the waiter what was taking so long.  Good spot if you are in N.D.G. but would not drive across town for it."}
{"text":"I've been there about 3 times. The times before service was slow food was good. I thought it was just because they were new and had to figure things out.   Wrong... 3 months later and we waited almost 40 mins for food.   We got the wedge salad- decent. When I got my burger - the cheese wasn't even melted! Almost 40 mins and they couldn't even melt the cheese! And the bread bun was cold. Disappointing:("}
{"text":"Loved it here. I'm a vegetarian. My boyfriend loves meat. And we were both extremely happy. Delicious. Great service. Come here for early lunch ... and late dinner."}
{"text":"I went tonight with one other person. Got this really long strand of hair in my mouth from my burger. Told the waitress which she in turn told the manager . He never came out to see me, he did when I asked him to and he said he's remaking the burger while my companion finished his. He offered a round of drinks but I said if I wanted drinks I could have ordered them myself , after my companion waited 30 minutes for them to remake the burger and me eating it the full bill arrived ! Not even my burger taken off ! I paid the bill and left a tip but told the manager I don't want anything as everything was taken care of but expressed how pretty unprofessional this experience was. I'll never be back"}
{"text":"- Menu is fun & original - burgers are really good (and big) so it's worth checking out on that alone. Fries are tasty too (but dangerous..) - Ambiance is ideal for a friendly outing, date night or with the kids, bearing in mind that it's lively, so no quiet evenings here. - Friendly and quick service - Original and thoughtful decor, especially if you like the bare wood look like I do - Overall, we're really happy to have a quaint and hip addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Food 2/10.  The poutine with veggie gravy was bland and runny, fries were soggy.  The place touts itself as a burger place....they were terrible.  I had 3 sliders which was a sample of their supposed three most popular burgers.  The beef was unseasoned, dried out and reminded me of frozen patties.   Drinks: 2/10.  I had their version of the old fashioned (D.A.D.) and it was undrinkable.  It was so unbelievably sugary that I had to ask for a beer instead.  The bartender tried it and said it was \"very bourboney\". I did not ask for this to be taken off the bill but clearly stated I did not want to drink it.  I instead ordered the house blonde beer which was half way palatable.   I had 1/3 of it.  The old fashioned was still on the bill. Service:  4/10.  The bartender was responsive but the server (a thin, tattooed woman) could not bring herself to smile if her life depended on it.  Despite there being so little customers we found ourselves having to flag down staff and no one asked how our meals were.  We were in Montreal for 5 days - this was by far and away the worst experience.  The owner did come in and put up some plants to spruce up the place - I wish he had a few minutes to inquire how we were enjoying our food and experience so we could have provided some direct feedback"}
{"text":"Deep Fried Mars Bar..!!!! Great atmosphere, Location is perfect, and the music is always just right. The food is amazing, love the sweet potatoe fries and the Cod Sandwich."}
{"text":"Seems people either love it or hate it. We're on the love it side. Their are lots of burger places in the neighbourhood but my girlfriend and I agree this is one of the best we've been to so far."}
{"text":"Not bad and pleasant enough atmos (nice terrase), but not the perfect burger that one might be looking for in a casual restaurant dedicated to burgers, fries and shakes. Please toast those buns just a teeny weeny bit!"}
{"text":"Great burger place. The meat is fresh and tasty, waitress was exceptional and very inviting. Their veggie poutine was also very good. Will definitely return for a quick bite."}
{"text":"A good and atypical brunch choice.  Service was very good, food was tasty and my traditional brunch companion was very happy with the breakfast burrito and homemade hot sauce.  The make a lot of ingredients from scratch which is appreciated.  Good for families, though the restaurant really would have knocked it out of the park if they served the kids first and didn't put green stuff on the eggs.  Brunch is also not that busy in an area with insufficient brunch choices (do you hear me Monkland?)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch when I noticed that this place opened up recently and although I was in for 'fast food' this is a full-scale restaurant with nice decor that features burgers. Perhaps I should have realized that I wasn't in the right place when my coke arrived in a hipster mason jar. Oh boy, i said to myself..... I ordered a giant burger plate and did not enjoy it. The burger was enormous but bland by any account. The bun is one of those that completely falls apart, forcing you to eat with a knife and fork. Fries were no better. I will not say that the food is bad just not to my taste. Won't be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"Great patties, juicy, flavourful, but in my opinion, the available sauces make it that much more special.  The fries are decent, and plentiful, and you can order the aforementioned sauces to dip the fries in.  The service has been friendly and efficient each time I've been there"}
{"text":"The June 2016 burger-of-the-month has the most incredible chimichurri I've ever had. Also got the tropical chicken burger and it was delicious - just the right spice and sweetness. The music selection is the perfect mix. Great BG microbrew too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a great burger. It can get busy."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just me but the burger came off as a bit...bland.   Everything else about the burger was great, toppings, bun, ratios, sauces, great fries..  But the burger itself lacked the flavor, any thing. It wasn't smoky, peppery, or even salty.    Anyway, I would go back. Maybe it was a fluke."}
{"text":"Three strikes your out! This was my third and final visit. The service is inept and amateurish and the managers are argumentative. Tonight first problem: fries arrived 5 minutes before burgers...since when are fries an entrée? 2- Forgot relish on a burger...no biggie except it took 3 visits from 2 waitresses to get relish. 3- Waitress arrives with sweet potato fries no one ordered.Again no biggie except they brought them  back 2 additional times, presumably getting colder and colder each time. And to top it off we were charged for them! How did it not occur to one of the 3 waitresses who tried to serve us the fries to strike the item from the bill? When we went back (we live nearby) to get refunded we were given attitude! We had similar problems my first two visits so this is definitely my last visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic gourmet burgers and a very friendly wait staff! Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the experience!"}
{"text":"OK we went back for brunch and yay! I'm a fan! I like that you can order off the entire menu (burgers and all) during weekend brunch, so hubby got a burger and I got the french toast + chicken add-on, and we shared a basket of fries.  There is seating for about 20 inside at comfortable distances. Brunch must be a local favourite for young families (unless there's an unwritten rule that you must have 2 kids to enter that I don't know about).   I actually much preferred the french toast and chicken here, compared with Prohibition on Monkland (which is quite famous for their weekend brunch menu). Can't even describe why... perhaps it was the more spacious seating, or the feeling that we weren't being corralled in and out quickly just to churn more profit."}
{"text":"Excellent food, poor service.  As an NDG resident we have a few holes in the wall that are certainly a treat and this may be the next one.  Getting a table was a bit ackward, we were told to sit then told to move. Getting menus also took us having to reach out to the busboy. Lastly getting drinks, the correct order (they are lost on which table ordered what) and ultimately the bill took too much time.  However the food is a different story, with fresh meat and homemade sauces the combination of flavors is delightful. It's an obvious difference in taste with other restaurant hamburgers in the area. The place just beams fresh, and that will keep it on our dine list.  Bottom line, if you like Hamburgers this place is up there with the best just be patient with the staff as they have a lot to learn!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast/brunch and there were four in our group and everyone loved everything they had. Chicken sandwich and fries were amazing. Poached Paradise was as good as it sounds. Large portions. Service was good and atmosphere was cool.  Surprised this want rated higher. We were very impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! We went there on a Saturday afternoon craving a great burger and it was exactly what we wanted! We made our own burgers and had the poutine and the potato skins as a side. The poutine wasn't that great - not our fave gravy we found it a little too sweet. but the potato skins were amazing. A must try! Be careful tho cause its quite a large side."}
{"text":"Service assez vite. Le serveur très gentil et la nourriture est très bonne. La viande est excellente!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal yesterday - 3oz beef burger with homemade umami sauce, pure perfection.    The service was great, the prices exceptional for such quality fresh ingredients.    So nice to have a burger that clearly was fresh ground and no fillers/binding agents!    I eat out often in Montreal and this is definitely one place that did not disappoint.  Small restaurant, so seating may be an issue in the future but well-worth the detour and any wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food, onion rings awesome, jerk fries on point and . Service was not good which was a bit of a spoiler. Overall great experience, improve on your service would love to give you more stars."}
{"text":"tldr; avoid, great build your burger options marred by inconsistency. Burgers are overcooked, waitresses are disinterested.  Oh boy, this place. I was pretty excited when it first opened but I literally reopened my Yelp account just to leave a review.  I'm going to start with the sides since they matter the least. The fries are decent enough, sometimes they salt them a little too much. Onion rings are great and potato skins are bland but complemented VERY strongly by the sauce they top them with (so the bottom of the pile where you run out of sauce is kind of lame). I recommend sharing the menage a trois, it's good enough to feed 3 even 4 if you're not a heavy eater and you get to sample everything.  They say they cook their burgers pink. In fact, it seems like a point of pride for them. Too bad, in my 6 times here, they've never been cooked pink. 5/6 times, my burger has been overdone and dry. They don't really season the patties too much so you'd hope for a juicy burger to make up for that but it doesn't work. The only time my burger wasn't well done, it was medium well (nice job guys!!). I'm also not a fan of the lettuce they use since they put too much, it adds a lot of crunch but it also seems to overpower the rest of the burger. It also adds a ridiculous amount of height. I usually build my own or get the divine inspiration which is a discount big Mac. Again, the inconsistency as far as toppings go do not maintain a consistent flavour profile.  You want a good burger on crescent, go to burger bar. They don't cook it pink (I think medium well) but the patties are well seasoned and they will on request.   Service is also not very good. The waitresses are terrible. I had a waiter once who was really chill and who cracked jokes but otherwise, they're kind of cold, or unattentive. Cold is a little bit of a harsh word but I'm trying to imply that they don't seem to care.   So there's that, not sure if the original restaurant is better, I'm sure it is. This place has huge inconsistency issues. The only appeal to me is that our can build your own burgers, but you can \"unofficially\" do that in burger bar."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Nice atmosphere.    Be there early if you need a table for four or more, otherwise you'll be waiting a while."}
{"text":"I came back to order the divine inspiration burgers for me and my wife, along with potato peels. I love their burger. True we should not be having too much meat, but when it's this good, what can i say, such a vice is to die for. Btw, this place is family friendly, and a lot of parents come here with their kids, toddlers and even babies."}
{"text":"A nice addition to Ville St-Laurent. In fact, they have a great mural depicting the borough; try to spot all the locations/people.  The Holy Swiss was delicious. Do expect a fatty, juicy burger though. L'Orozco was also a nice surprise. Sweet potato fries were great. Side of fries is enough for two.  Place was packed on a Sunday evening (families, couples, young and old). They lose a star for not doing any effort to serve our group in French, even if we continuously switched back to it. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great selection of gourmet burgers, sides, and cocktails.  While the gourmet burger thing is a bit overdone, Notre-Boeuf-de-Grâce does it very well. They have a solid selection of house creations, but you can also build your own.  Their cocktails also help them stand out. There's a selection of house specials, but they'll do a decent job of mixing just about any stable you'd think to order while eating a burger.  Seating is sometimes a challenge. The place is often busy, but I guess that, too, is a reflection of the food."}
{"text":"Didnt serve me for an hour and gave me a cunty response about it. 0/10 would popup powerbomb again ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing burger. The deco is very cool and the stuffs are kind. Always go with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Been many times. Very good burgers, fries and onion rings. Only had one mediocre burger when it was too salty but overall very good food. Kids enjoyed it also."}
{"text":"If you're on Notre-Dame street and looking for a nive hearty burger, look no further because this is the place! Their burgers are freshly made, they're big and they also offer build it yourself options. They have creative sauces, their buns and fries are good and we even had latkes (potato pancakes) as an entree and were pleasantly surprised by how tadg they were, even with apple sauce and a tyoe of mayo to dip it in!"}
{"text":"The regular burger was too salty. The burger with eggplant, cilantro and tandoori mayo was something really special, however. Fired were delicious, as were most sauces. Great burger bet that we'll attend again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Nice decor and good service. The burgers are good, but not the best I've tried. I've tried this place twice  and every time I have found the meat needed seasoning and the bun is way too thick for the meat."}
{"text":"The patty seasoning they use is remarkable, sauce selections are creative; tandoori mayo, ranch-chipotle blend & green goddess herbed avocado.  The burgers are exceptional."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while. It's a great looking place and the decor is well done. The burger was delicious. Nice and juicy. The fries were good as well. My complaint is with the beer selection. With so many great beers in this city, they had a choice of Sapporo, Okanagan, or another house brand. Pretty disappointing. For that reason alone, I don't think I'll be making a return visit. If you're not concerned with that kind of stuff, then it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Très bon resto et ambiance très sympa, les burgers sont excellents. Le service est de qualité et rapide malgré le nombre de clients, les serveurs sont aimables et souriants. Je recommande !"}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review of a local indie restaurant in my hood, especially as I was really excited to try this place out, but honestly: it is AWFUL. Like, resoundingly shitty. Management needs to get up in this and sort it out!!  DO NOT ignore the bad reviews, especially if you swing by and they are busy: you will have a mediocre experience at best :'(  Here's a bit more about why our meal here sucked big time:  - We started off at a table but the slow, unresponsive and mediocre service prompted us to opt for take-out which ended up being worse.  - It took them OVER 45 minutes to prepare our order of two burgers and sides. Granted they were very busy (possibly surprisingly busy for a Monday), but they gave us no heads up that we would wait a very long time for our order. We would see orders sit on the counter for up to 15 minutes at a time getting cold with nobody picking them up. Long lines at the cash created delays and chaos that they really shouldn't have.   - The entire staff seemed like it was their first day, from the waitstaff to cashier & cooks, everyone seemed thoroughly overwhelmed and had no prioritization. We were right by the cash so we heard all the mini crises and nobody appeared to be a manager or able to keep things moving well. These poor staff members seem undertrained and undersupervised, and the entire operation appears to not be optimized for production or even for health/sanitization. Having worked many years ago at a busy family pizza restaurant in college, I am so grateful I got good training and that my bosses ran a tight ship, because seeing these guys scramble was sad and frustrating.   - We sat by the bar for 50 minutes so we got a clear view of the station and it was DISGUSTING. The garnish area had withered/molting mint leaves and super dry lime & lemon wedges, having tended bar professionally I could tell the garnishes were not fresh and were possibly left out or stored over multiple shifts. Unsanitary, unappetizing and frankly, an eyesore to boot! I would NEVER order a cocktail here.   - When we got home we realized they got my order wrong and on top of it half the toppings were missing. For example, there were supposed to be mushrooms on my burger and there was literally only one! My burger patty was broken, which doesn't affect the taste but at that price & wait time, I expect the food to be presented reasonably well and not look like it was dropped a few times. There was no lettuce, tomato or trimmings either, they completely forgot them. The burgers tasted OK, but nothing special given the price and for the wait time, especially considering they gave me the wrong burger after I waited over 45 minutes for a pick-up an order that I took home myself. The fries were clearly old as they had that crumbly old-fry texture and they were cooked in oil that has not been changed in a while. The onion rings were overbattered for our taste, but that's a matter of personal preference, they were perfectly edible. The potato skins were gross and we didn't eat them at all, they tasted like they were reheated from a few days back.  I have no issue waiting for good food if I know I'm going to wait, but waiting for mediocre food in a stressed, chaotic, unsanitary environment and being charged a premium for it is just not a fun time. I'll happily pay a premium for food at a trendy restaurant if it's great and I know I'll wait for it to be well-prepared.  Save your hard-earned dollars and go to Burger De Ville, Mister Steer or any number of decent diners that'll serve you a better burger in half the time and probably for less money (depending on what you order, obvs).   So very sad as I was hoping this would be a new go-to joint for us, but it's a very hard pass! Blech."}
{"text":"The menu was pretty simple which I like and the service was excellent - very friendly staff. We liked the décor and it made for a nice atmosphere. The burgers were great quality and well-sized."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my wife and kids... the service was great, polite and very nice.  The atmosphere is very nice, although we went there on a quiet time. It is very nice place for people with children, they provide crayons and a paper to colour, also the kids menu is good, and prices are fairly reasonable.  The burger is very delicious and I can admit that it is one of the nicest burgers we had for a long time.  If you are in the neighbourhood then you have to try it. I wouldn't recommend the poutine, however you can try making your own burger there."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings were excellent. Meaty, great sauce. Our first mistake was not ordering enough bacon wrapped dates - phenomenal. Burgers were delicious. Meat was cooked perfectly, cheese melted just right. Cons: 1- there was no ketchup and mustard on the table (I hate having to ask for these essential condiments) 2- there was a little bit too much bun to be honest. Some of us thought it was fine, but a few could've used a little less bun. Bottom line, there was definitely a bun issue. 3- potato skins were lobbied for by the the waitress, and to be blunt, they were falsely advertised. Ya. Didn't love them. No bacon or cheese. Not quite a \"potato skin\" in my books. Overall, food was delicious. Great ambiance. Nice big TVs, good music, warm decor, extremely well priced. The floors were nicely textured."}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas miss burger pour deux sous, toutefois le burger que j'ai choisi était excellent. Assis à la terrasse situé à l'ombre, j'ai choisi le burger au fromage suisse, aux oignons caramélisés. C'était très très bon! J'ai été encore plus impressionnée par l'assiette d'une collègue qui a choisi le burger vege composé de fromage de chèvre pané. J'ai fait un croc dans le burger végé de ma collegue et je dois avouer que je suis tombee sous le charme. Il est clair que je reviendrai pour le goûter."}
{"text":"Great burger ,great sangria , great concept  je suis allé rejoindre une amie pour l'heure du brunch à NDG en un belle matinée, ce que j'ai pus constater c'est qu'il sont trés occupé la clientèle est très variées, des familles complètes de jeunes couples des gens d'affaires NBG à apparemment su ce faire une place dans le cartier. Ne connaissant pas du tout l'endroit et étant avec quelqu'un qui y mangeais très souvent, j'ai suivis ses conseils, en commençant par un mimosa et un pichet de sangria blanche (pourquoi pas se gâter) très bon choix. Elle a pris bagel et saumon et moi j'ai opté pour le burger au poulet, sauce avec morceaux d'ananas . C'était délicieux . Bon service , selon mon amie qui connais bien la proprio il utilise que des ingredients frais de première qualités, je n' en doute pas une seconde. Hâte d'y retourné pour goûter le reste du menu surtout la poutine et les burger au boeuf."}
{"text":"Love this place great mouth watering burgers and the best staff. I must say their customer service is the best I have ever experienced! Try the sweet potatoes fries and ask to have the jerk spices added. My persona favorite is the Holy Swiss"}
{"text":"This place is a better version of La Belle et la Boeuf. The food tasted amazing, the decor was creatively original, and the servers were exceptionally nice. We got there during happy hour and were served some of the best mojitos in downtown. As for the food, the Poseidon Fish Burger was so light and fresh and the Divine Creation burger surely lived up to its name. Although our meal was pricier than most, it makes up for the experience and food quality. It's definitely a new favourite of mine! Also, try sitting next to the huge wall of art by the entrance, it's a humorous depiction of Montreal in all of its weird glory."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, as you can customize and make your own burger. I find it a bit pricey considering that it doesn't come with fries or any sides.   The ambiance is ok. We came here on a hot summer day and they weren't any AC (or seems to be) so we just wanted to leave quickly.   I didn't find this place particularly impressive. Don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Do you like burgers? Right, who doesn't like burgers? Anyway, these guys have them all. Beef, chicken, fried chicken and veggie. You can't go wrong here. Either build your own insane creation (I'm not kidding kids. You can pretty much build a 10\" tall burger here) or pick from a plethora of NDB creations. Wash it down with their amazing, home made ginger ale, and you will thank me and them. Not going to condone drinking but if you happen to tie one on, then your hangover cure resides here. Oh and did I say they have their own coffee brand that is most excellent too."}
{"text":"I've visited this resto twice in the past few months and both times I had a wonderful experience both in service and taste.  First time I ordered the Immaculate Conception burger with a side of to-die-for onion rings and the second time I went with the Thou Shalt Bacon Cheeseburger which was also delicious and another order of onion rings.  Diet cherry coke was a bonus as well.  Will definitely recommend and return when back in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"I tried two of their desserts: the fried oreos and fried mars. Omg it is SO good! But you will die of a sugar overdose and probably have diabetes after, but it's totally worth it. My friend and I thought that we could try both, but with the ice cream on top we were dying(it was a good death).  We needed to drink water each second because of the amount of chocolate we were eating. The waitress was super kind with us and kept bringing us water and laughed with us. Definitely worth a try if you love dessert, just don't try both at the same time haha"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever had. Every time I go I make a point of trying something new, and I'm never disappointed! As far as I know there's nothing bad on the menu, and the service is friendly. The whole atmosphere is incredible, you really can't go wrong. Only gripe is that they don't take reservations and it fills up quick, so if you decide to go, don't hesitate because you will have to wait. As far as I'm concerned, it's worth it though!"}
{"text":"Oh... The yumminess.. Fabulous burger. Not falling apart, but not overly dense. Fresh, hot and very tasty. Tater tots were a great add-on. House made cherry coke to wash it down.  Great place, nice patio, great decor."}
{"text":"Fresh ground beef makes for a good burger. Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.  Pretty basic burger and fry. $50 for two was somewhat steep for a burger.  Service was not helpful as first time guests."}
{"text":"Freshest tastiest burger meat ever! I can't eat a burger anywhere else anymore. I've tried hundreds of places over a span of 30 years and this joint is the best. If you take it just plain with nothing on it on any of their buns it will be the juiciest burger you've ever had in your life. I'm not kidding, I eat there often and it's very close to where I live. You can order already formulated burgers off their menu or chose to make your own with many meat size, bun &, cheese choices, and a vast variety of condiments. Enjoy! I did every single time."}
{"text":"Second time here, service was excellent thanks to Sonia. Ask for her you won't be disappointed. All her recommendations were spot on. Food was great, just like the last time. Try the desert, espresso and ice cream, awesome!"}
{"text":"What a disgusting service. The owner John is a true classless POS. order completely prepared wrong through UberEATS but it's not their mindless chefs fault. Zero effort to make it right and got hung up on to boot! I guess it's too hard for their chefs to comprehend a burger with 5+ condiments because what I received was a patty with pickles and sauce. Oh not to mention my good friend who's vegetarian receiving bacon on her veggie burger... used to love the food here but John and his incompetent staff ruined it for me. Bye bye!"}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd time we order from here first time we were ecstatic was so yummy....second time was not super but we guessed it was cause it was busy.....but this time Holy.... I had tropical chicken burger when it got here was SO wet the bread was uneatable so much sauce everything drenched in it...come on that just seems like cooks that don't care that wouldn't of passed in restaurant... My wife's burger divine inspiration was so wet too she are the meat without bread....the jerk fries....they put so much spices on it wasn't only too spicy but just too much on there.....I should of called restaurant to get money back... Barely ate anything except for amazing fried mars bar Let me tell ya I won't be ordering from here again beware they offer delivery but maybe they shouldn't since everything is drenched when you receive it"}
{"text":"Location: Ville St. Laurent - no issues with parking, as they've got a parking lot.   The place: Great decor and vibe - it's got an urban and somewhat hipster feel to it.  Hipsters. They're everywhere. Music gets a little loud closer to 7pm though, so expect to talk loudly to your dinner date(s). It's not  huge restaurant by any means, so I'd say it probably gets packed around 7pm, on Thursday-Saturday nights.  The goods: I decided to build my own burger because, well, I'm picky. I added lettuce, caramelized onions, bacon and avocado sauce. The meat was cooked perfectly (medium) and they were pretty darn generous with that bacon (which was delicious, by the way). The caramelized onions were cold, which I found unusual - I've always been served these when they were hot.... the avocado sauce sound good on paper but was underwhelming. The bun was light and pretty great. I also ordered fries that came out crispy and in a serving size worthy of four people. Way too many patates for one person! That said, the fries had no seasoning and there were no salt shakers on the table - they definitely could have used some flavor. I also ordered one of the cocktails (Heavenly Pink something or other) and it was pretty good for a burger joint!  Service: Great - we were attended to the entire time we were there - our water glasses were kept full and wait staff checked in on us, on the regular.   Price point: The total was about $25 for the lot."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and really awesome menu! I have to admit that neither of us got a burger at a place that specialized in burgers but that's because their menu was so much more than burgers. I went with Samson's Lox which was probably the best smoked salmon sandwich that I've ever eaten. Packed with salmon, lettuce, onions, tomatoes and capers on an onion bun. I had trouble fitting it in my mouth. Delicious. The other sandwich we got was a make your own veggie burger in a lettuce wrap with avocado, aioli and grilled pineapple. Also huge and very yummy. I had the best drink of our trip there - lychee sangria. Woah. They had a ton of beers on tap. The waitresses were all super helpful. The only negative was that they randomly started blasting (and I do mean blasting) the stereo and it was so loud that you couldn't reasonably chat with someone sitting next to you and had to yell. No idea who wants music that loud. Prices and food quality were really great. It's in a busy area but there was no wait and plenty of seating. It's a must visit on our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Maybe because I had it delivered by uber eats but I wasn't a fan.  Burger was huge cold and soggy, no flavour.  French fries were half cooked.  The fried curds were so greasy it stained my table cloth.  Maybe If I actually went to eat there it might be better but so far it's a no go."}
{"text":"Don't go if you're in a hurry or on a tight budget but the food is quite good. We've been several times for burgers, fries and a cold beer.   It can get very busy in there so I'd suggest going for either an early supper or a late supper."}
{"text":"We've done take out several times from the Ville st Lo location. The food is great for take-out but quite better when you go in person. Burgers taste fresh and juicy and they have classic options for sides like onion wings as well as inventive options like bacon-wrapped dates. Not sure about people complaining about the service... every time we've eaten here whether take-out or not we were met with impeccable service even during busy periods. Place seems clean and really nice modern decor. Overall, I wouldn't say it's the best tasting burger in town but definitely one of the freshest and juiciest. We really enjoy every experience we've had and are happy they're in our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I came here by accident and I tried the holy swiss burger. It was the juiciest burger I have ever eaten. The service was great and the price was good. There fries were okay."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!  I love how you can customize your own. It reminded me a lot of Burger Royal because you could choose the size and the burgers don't come with the fries.   The meat is juicy and tasty. I made my burger with avocado and it was so goooooooood. Fresh and well presented. I just wish they had a mac and cheese burger :P  Seating is ample and comfortable. Service is fast and people are friendly.  Honestly, a really great burger place."}
{"text":"We are long time fans of NBG and I was happy to hear that one was opening a bit closer to home. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. My burger was beige, dry, and hard. I complained to the waiter and he told his manager, who did not want to do anything about it. When I spoke with him he began to argue with me about safe cooking temperatures (the menu states they serve it pink...it sure wasn't!) Plus my son's hotdog bun...stale. The manager still didn't feel the need to offer any kind of recompense. Drive to NDG for the real thing. This place was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"This place always delivers what it says it will- nice juicy burgers with great fries. I love that I can get my burger in lettuce instead of a bun. We've never been disappointed! I recently tried another location and it was not good a all. Stick with the NDG restaurant and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Ate  there for the first time and it was delish! Love the 3oz cheeseburgers, gives room for a side order of sweet potato fries...Will return when craving that Burger!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's cozy on a cold day, staff is kind and attentive and the food is amazing. Been twice and about to hit it for a third."}
{"text":"I walked by the new one around Guy-Concordia that opened last year and was curious to try it.  So, on the coldest possible evening in Feb on a Friday night, I went out with my friend to eat here since neither of us had gone before. They have happy hour drink prices until 6pm.  I'm glad to have got there early and got a high table in the corner.  The wait staff told us that Friday night is the busiest nights for them. Now the food, the burgers are their main attraction and the fries and onion rings are great. The patties are slightly pink and that's how they cook them so that they don't end up dry and tough. The great part about their menu is that almost everything is customisable. Ingredients are fresh and unique as well. The deep fried desserts were a great touch to finish off the meal. I enjoyed my experience since I showed up early, but if you show up late, there's a wait time involved.  Overall, its a good way to get an alternative to the usual burgers offered."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. We used to go frequently at the other one in NDG. This time the buns was super dry and cold, the meat was over cooked. I love this place normally, I'll probably just go back to the other location."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a while. Came here during my lunch break the other day as it was close to me.  I was surprised at how well cooked and flavorful the meat was. Definitely will be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"I had a really hard time eating my burger. When I go to restaurant, i usually avoid ordering burgers. So hard to eat and it makes a mess. But my friends wanted to try this place. It was a new resto so why not. Their specialities are burgers. I took the fried chicken burger. The fried chicken was way too greasy, too big for the bun, the sauce was dripping all over my plate. I ended up just eating the chicken. Burgers are definitely not my first choice in the menu!"}
{"text":"all things delicious! i had the d.a.d.'s burger which is kind of like an indian curried sauce on top of cucumber, tomato, cilantro and the best fresh beef patty I've had in a long time, didn't feel heavy in the stomach like other patties do.  fries were nice and crispy and thin cut which i like and the location is very close to my home. hands down, best burger joint in Montreal. Thanx you guys!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 different kinds of burgers and found both of the yellow buns to be on the dry side. I just ate the burger without the bun.... and it was adequate. The onion rings were on the overly crunchy side as well as the fries..... as both had been over-cooked. The $3 Mozza burger at A&W that we had earlier in the week was actually better..and so were the A@W onion rings.   We will continue to go to A@W when we fancy hamburgers."}
{"text":"Usually go here with friends. Love the décors in the restaurant. Burgers are fresh and with nice beef."}
{"text":"Great burger place.. Just ask for well done if you don't like your burger medium well.. but other than that, everything's good"}
{"text":"Consistency is key.  Order 1 perfect order 2 perfect order 3...oops.  Wedge salad was not the same the 2 times I ordered it- first time was nice second time I got a chunk of iceberg from the middle of the lettuce that was bitter and hard as a rock- iceberg isn't that expensive so when your buying a salad you hope they would get rid of the inedible parts.  Winter salad- first time nice - second time beet chips replaced with cooked beets- not the same, less goat cheese also. The last mistake was a glitch with uber eats who decided to add Chicken to the winter salad which we didn't want cause it was for a vegetarian so they ended up not eating. When your ordering food from the same place you expect it to be the same every time. Off to the next burger place."}
{"text":"Three stars because the burgers are awesome, but the service majorly sucks. It seems like they're always short one person or something. I've been forgotten about (and ended up walking out) twice. I only get it to go now."}
{"text":"Good fresh food. Service was very friendly fast and informative. The atmosphere was excellent with tvs and patio was opened"}
{"text":"Great food but really need to figure out their staffing problem. A work lunch shouldn't take two hours!"}
{"text":"This place is simply too expensive for what you get. A burger, fries, and a soda/beer will run $30-40 with tip. Really, that's just too much. The food is okay, but it's not worth that much. Sorry, guys."}
{"text":"What better way to enjoy LabourDay ... Decided to head to this new burger joint that everyone has been raven about... Can't believe we've waited this long to come by... The burgers were delicious and the cocktails were tasty and well portioned, the service was great, our waitress Britney was really on top of things and made our experience pleasant! Great music made for A+ ambiance ... Clean new establishment and totally worth stopping by"}
{"text":"Been to the NDG location Labour Day 2016 for Dinner and was super happy with my experience then.  I was thrilled to learn that the owners decided to open a spot downtown which is closer to me.   A friend and mine decided to do brunch as we were overdue on catching up... we decided to try NotreBoeuf de Grâce for brunch.   Our waitress Chelsey made for a pleasant experience and was attentive to our needs. Food was DELISH... it's like the chef knew that I was there because the food was Made with love ! (Just as I love it!)   I had the breakfast sandwich and requested an add on of avocado! The sandwich was filling and prepared to perfection. My plate came with 'mashed/shredded' potatoes which I couldn't even finish thats how satisfying my sandwich was.  My mimosaS... (insert shy face) were on point...  My friend's smoked salmon platter was also prepared to perfection... she got several slices of fresh salmon, salad, bagel, capers and I believe crème fraîche...  Overall Amazing service and great food!  The place is CLEAN which is super important to me.   Nice décor!   You gotta eat there!   Returned for their Burgers on a cold Winter evening = 5Star!!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there tonight. The food was so good, my friend and I didn't have time to take a picture. It was the yummiest, juiciest burger I've had in years. Perfectly cooked with delicious condiments and fresh bun. The poutine was decadent.  We were surprised that neither of us felt that greasy bloating after eating! It is worth the trip and we're excited to have a great burger joint in our 'hood!"}
{"text":"Restaurant super mignon pour un petit posage dans une bonne ambiance. Les burgers y sont délicieux et à un prix largement abordable. Je conseille fortement le banana split comme dessert c'est une tuerie!"}
{"text":"Biased to this place because it is a street away from my house and they have the option to make your own burger.  The place has a really casual vibe, the staff is polite and check on you often.  This is not my favourite burger place, but it is affordable and I am sure to keep going here.  Their tandoori sauce (being Indian of course!) and their special secret sauce is my favourite. I usually get the Red Wine Sangria or the beer. The fries are enormous portion (has to be shared by three), you have to order it separate.   There aren't many tables here so there is a bit of line up on weekends.   Highly recommend this place to my friends and family"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers! Fast service and we had really good customer service :) Our waiter was friendly and prompt. Resto has nice decor and it was not too crowded on the weekday night we went."}
{"text":"Had the Garden of Eden (veggie burger) with fries and beer battered onion rings. Amazing food! Ask for the chapotli dip. Only down side is there are no combos that are a burger, fries and drink. The combos include a burger and an alcoholic drink. The homemade softdrinks are really good too. Expect to pay about 20.00 for a burger, side and softdrink. The restaurant is based on a religious theme, and the menu items have fun names. They named a burger after the old D.A.D. bagel shop that used to be there before, which I thought was very nice. Worth going, try the milk shakes."}
{"text":"I understand from folks in the know that this is newly opened in the hood.  Use to be a Mom and Pop variety store which also sold Indian food for many, many years.  The new establishment has kindly given a shout out to the previous folks with an aptly namef Dad's Burger on the menu. The atmosphere is very cozy with bare brick walls and lovely high ceilings.  Nice ample patio on the front. No liquor license yet on the patio but we were told that would be coming any day now.  We sat just inside the doors and had the best of both worlds. Tables are a good distance apart with very comfortable benches which line the wall.  We had the pleasure of sitting beside a couple who were obviously on a first date. Boy did she do a lot of talking! It was very amusing! Great variety on the menu with tons of choices.  There are  burger meals which come with a suggested beverage and also burgers which you can build yourself with such a variety of toppings that I stopped counting at 30 choices and the majority of them free. Sauces, fresh toppings, wide variety of cheeses and more!  The beef is ground fresh daily and that is very clear in the taste of the patty.  Very moist and perfectly prepared to perfect pinkness. The potato skins were recommended to us by the very attentive waitress to share.  As a self confessed fry freak I had to try those as well.  Both worth sharing and very tasty.   Fries were crispy and oh so soft on the inside. The skins were interestingly shaped as they were flat instead of crescent shaped as I'm use to. They too were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Skins arrived with Chipotle,  Green Goddess Avocado and in-house made ketchup in dollops all over. Fries arrived with ketchup and mayo for dipping.  Lastly, very reasonably priced with most meals with burger, side and drink (even house beer)for under $20.00. All in all a very enjoyable meal with kind, very service oriented staff in a warm and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on New Year's Eve and enjoyed the food. I ordered a burger, fries, and beer.  The burger did taste fresh which is good since they advertise fresh ground beef daily. They allowed me to create my own and make a bunch of substitutions which I appreciated. I liked the fries a lot as well. The beer was pretty good but the food was what I enjoyed most.   Our waiter was very nice and checked in on us often to make sure we had everything we needed. The place looked very clean. I could tell the kitchen area was well cleaned and managed as well. It's nice to see a burger place that doesn't have tons of grease and grime near on the kitchen equipment."}
{"text":"Love this place! All their hamburgers are on point, and their drinks are awesome (free pour!) nice little terrace too if you can find a spot."}
{"text":"The only negative is that I ate too much. I have heard so much about this place and finally tried it this evening. I was not disappointed.  As a vegetarian it's hard to find good places to enjoy a good veggie burger. I have found the perfect place. Their poutine is vegetarian as well. I tried it. Not the best poutine I've had but it is very good.  The burger was messy but delicious. Large portion and very fair price too. Their potato skins, fries and onion rings are AMAZING. My wife and I shared the 'Ménage a Trois' side dish. It's big enough to be a meal. If you haven't been there, you're missing out. Chances are you'll see me there again soon, and often!"}
{"text":"this place has horrible service. don't go unless you have 2 hours to spend waiting on a burger."}
{"text":"Had some great experiences working with this sweet local biz, but this review is based on popping in hungry and in a rush one day last week. I was warmly greeted and the server kindly understood the state I was in, hungry(hangry almost) with just 20 minutes between appointments. She didn't know me, she just treated everyone with a high level of thoughtfulness, I watched her do it repeatedly as I chilled at the bar and ate.  I ordered a veggie dog and didn't get the slightest reaction from what is admittedly kind of a weird order in a place with Beef in the name. It came out quick and the cook came to check in and chat quickly about veggie dogs. The texture of the dog and the bun were fresh and great and I was happy with everything. Happiest of all with the warm happy vibe between the staff and customers. NBG provided a calming break from an annoying afternoon, I'm thankful this spot is available for harried humans in the area."}
{"text":"I had the (vegetarian) poutine. It was pretty good- I would rate it 7/10. The chips were crispy and delicious, the cheese was a little too warm/soft, the gravy was a little sweet and tasted of nutmeg, and I could see mustard seeds in it, the proportions were good, and there were chopped green onions on top. I am a bit of a purist when it comes to poutine, so I'm not big on complicating the sauce with spices and such, and the green onions were unnecessary, but it was, nonetheless, quite tasty! Vegetarian sauce is always a bonus. For those who eat meat, the burgers looked amazing! Cool place with homemade drinks like cherry bubbly lemonade. They're licensed too."}
{"text":"If I wrote this a year ago I would have given it 5 stars. However as of this date, I can only give it two stars, and those two stars go exclusively to the food itself. The food is super good, I've never had anything other than a perfectly enjoyable dinner or brunch. Here's why I'm giving two stars:  The service is SO SLOW and you will wait an eternity for someone to even notice you're there. Once you get the menus they'll immediately ask you what you want to drink but since we just got the menus, I mean, give us a couple minutes? Their definition of a couple is around......20-30 minutes. Finally the server will take your order, and then you'll be wishing you hadn't even considered sitting down. You will wait an eternity for your dinner, and then when it finally arrives, don't even THINK about sending it back for fear of waiting another eternity while your friends are either eating without you, or dying on the inside, watching their food grow ever colder. Other tables would come, get served, and go, and still...some of us waiting for our order. I asked to see a dessert menu once, they brought it but they never came back to take my order. I left...dessertless. I waited over an HOUR for brunch one morning. I was about to stand up and leave when the food finally arrived. That's also when the server stopped coming around with coffee. He delivered the food so job's done!  Again, the food is superb! You just better be willing to wait for it. I suggest going there before you're actually hungry. Because you will be by the time you get served."}
{"text":"Really great food. But small restaurant. My friends and I had to wait 25 minutes on a Friday at 8PM only to give up and leave. I proceeded to go back the next day for lunch with my boyfriend. We loved the burgers! Not cheap but not too pricey. Great fries too!"}
{"text":"Great place for a brunch!   I ordered the one with the bread, two poached eggs on top with avocadoes.  Then, I went crazy with the drinks; orange press, milkshakes and orange juice. I had a bit of trouble with the first server. I think I have an accent or something. I don't know. Everything is pretty healthy to eat and I didn't think I add 5 more pounds after today.   The food is great. I love the concept of having anything I want in the menu.   Overall, I didn't come in a 9 am because of my hangover from last night supper.  It was still worth the trip over there because everything is so good. It is on my list of brunch place to go"}
{"text":"Very good environment, tasty burger (Holi Swiss), yami cocktail, the best nichy resto in Ville Saint-Laurent! Their boss Denise is very cool!"}
{"text":"My experience here was worse than terrible! We orderd a 9 oz burger and the meet was raw as if you just take it out of fridge, grill it for 30 sec each side and put it in the burger. No kidding! 9 oz is a thick piece of meat, but at least medium? I could see the strings of raw ground meet... it's so disgusting to remember.. I told the waitress and she was suprised to see the meet like that, but just a simple \"sorry\" and took it for extra grilling, but again it was raw as hell!  They didn't change my dish, they didn't even give us any offer to make it up. Not even asked us if we were happy at the end.  They just passed us the bill. Is this a fair customer service?.."}
{"text":"This place was impressive. we rolled into Montreal (as tourists) super late and needed some food. We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it!.  The burgers were delicious. The beef tasted fresh and so did the bun they used. I have to compliment their homemade lemonade which wasn't too cloyingly sweet like some lemonade can be.   They were helpful with givig us sightseeing recs and even gave us extra gravy on our poutine! We're back in NJ now and are craving that poutine!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, and it's no secret - expect a wait during peak hours. Sometimes staff are slow to take orders, not a place I would recommend unless you've got ample time to eat. It's well worth the wait, though. Also a favourite for a hearty weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Terrible poutine, terrible service and terrible drink. My husbands old fashioned was sweet, which means it was not made correctly and when he said something and got a beer instead they still charged us. The mushroom burger was great! However the poutine was sweet too, ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! And horrible service!   And to top it off the owner came in while we were there sitting at the bar, two of three customers, and doesn't say hi or ask us how the food was at all! DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the location in NDG a few times now.  Great burgers every time, and the sweet potato fries are very good.  It's always busy at that location, so it's a very good sign that the food is great."}

{"text":"Tonight John and I went for dinner at Notre-Boeuf-de-Grace located at 5732 Sherbrooke O in NDG.  For those of you who were distraught when hearing of the closure of the iconic D.A.D's Bagels, here's the resto that replaced it!  We have been wanting to go ever since it opened and we are so glad that we finally went.  Upon arrival, you sit wherever is available in the small but very cozy room.  There are two televisions, brick and wood walls and very nice booth seats on one side of the room.  There is also a small bar where you can sit and watch the chefs work their magic.  John ordered the $5 shake of the day - chocolate of course, the Divine burger (which the waitress described as a Gourmet Big Mac) with fried egg and bacon,  devils which were bacon wrapped yams and chicken wings.  I have a pretty bad case of lactose intolerance but I had one sip of the shake and it was delicious.  It resembled the shakes at Baton Rouge but with more ice cream and without the high price.  John said it was like a Belleville shake (which is a really good thing apparently).  I didn't try the burger but John finished it in about two seconds and said \"Now THAT'S a burger!\" so it must have been amazing.  The bacon wrapped yams were very interesting and had a great taste to them, it's something I would make at home for sure because let's be honest, wrapping anything in bacon makes it a billion times better.  The wings were good- they had a kick when you got parts with the sauce on it but other than that, they were pretty plain wings.   I ordered the poutine (move over lactose intolerance, I love cheese too much).  It tasted amazing.  They had a sauce that involved a type of seed I can't put my finger on (from what I could tell) and they also had scallions on top which left a really good aftertaste.  Their fries are also AMAZING.  Since it is such a cozy restaurant, we were pretty close to the family of five next to us (three sons- ADORABLE) and everyone minus the youngest had fries included with their meal and just having the fries by themselves looked delicious.  The restaurant was very good with having kid friendly dishes.  They had catered to whatever the family asked for their youngest child and the family took pictures of the children sitting on the booth side of the room.  You know a restaurant is good when it's worthy of family photo shoots.  Looking at the menu, they also serve cocktails, their own house beer and house soda. Overall, the service was VERY fast, very friendly and we will definitely be going back to try more of the menu options.  They also have veggie burgers for those who are vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place had great food, great service, relaxing atmosphere and I really enjoyed the music and overall vibe. Great place, definitely check it out. The my burger was pretty good too lol"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was pretty empty, perhaps because of the heavy rain. Decor is nice and they have two large TVs - one with a basketball game and the other with a hockey match playing.   We ordered 2 B.G. Blonde beers and 2 B.G. Classics with fries.  The beers arrived quickly. The burgers were nothing special - dry meat (even though they say they cook their burgers 'pink') and mealy tomatoes. We got their special sauces for the fries which were good - I especially liked their spicy mayo.   Service was OK, our waitress did not once check in on us, but the other servers were generally friendly and helpful when we needed something.  All-in-all, I could make a better burger at home, but they did use a nice quality beef."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time coming to this restaurant and I can't wait to go back. The food is great, comes out nice and hot. Very friendly and honest staff (when asked about portion sizes concerning the French fries, she responded that 1 order is enough for 2 to share)."}
{"text":"Oh this place was a great surprise . Location was perfect we found  parking right away. The brunch line moved so quickly and the staff was really pleasant...our waiter kept forgetting about us (I'm assuming),  but other staff members were right on it...a bus person gave us our menus since waiter and host forgot. Then she took a while to come and ask for our order but when we did our food came so quickly. I had the animal fri3s to start which were mouth watering but way more of a serving than I expected. My partner got the onion rings which for 1$ extra u can hve some special honey which was really rich also came w special sauce ..delish! Main course he got the bbq chicken sandwich and i got the veggie burger and wooow sooo good full of flavour  i cannot complain"}
{"text":"This place makes a great burger ! really cute decor for sit down dining both indoor and outdoor seating. our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. A bit pricey but well worth it considering the freshness of the food and quality of the burgers. I had their version of a Big Mac and really enjoyed it ! I'm definitely going back to try more of their burgers and to try their breakfast"}
{"text":"Had very good service, it's nice to have this kind of place in the neighbourhood. Downside, they don't have a licence to drink on the terrasse so you can't pretty much have a beer on a sunny day outside. The Divine choice on the menu is very similar to a Big Mac but really tasty ! Would recommend for a casual chilling"}
{"text":"Cool trendy find just outside of the city. The servers were super nice and chatted with us. I would definitely recommend adding Bailey's to a chocolate milkshake! Great burgers and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"3.5***  Came here around 9pm on a Monday night. We almost had the whole restaurant to ourselves. The two-floor space is very trendy yet rustic. I really liked the atmosphere and music. Only initial complain was that our water glasses had a weird smell/taste.  We each ordered a burger. I had \"the mother of all burgers\" off the secret menu and my partner had a burger that had salami and a latkah inside it (can't remember the name of this one unfortunately). We ordered fries, half regular and half sweet potato, to enjoy with our meal. Service was quick and friendly. This is a restaurant with planks instead of plates so it could lead to quite the mess. (I don't understand the no-plate trend!!!) The burgers were a little overcooked. It says on the menu that they are served pink but mine was clearly well done. The bun was really good and you could tell they use high quality ingredients. I enjoyed my partner's burger better than my own and would probably order differently if I come back here.  Fries were also delish and were a pretty big portion.   Food:3/5 Atmosphere:5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Value:4/5"}
{"text":"This place is good for the burgers, the poutine gravy is a little weird and the breakfast I had there was TERRIBLE. HOWEVER, if you are in the mood for a mid price greasy delicious burger, hit this place up. Service is pretty speedy."}
{"text":"Wow! Incroyable! Superbe place, service un peu long mais on était en plein rush. Très bon concept (font tout ou presque eux mêmes), beau décors et très bon choix. Niveau burger, tout y était : excellente consistance, excellente cuisson, goût incroyable. Vraiment une très belle place à aller sans hésiter."}
{"text":"Great burger joint in NDG! There's a terrace out front which is perfect for summer. There's also the option of creating your own burger which I ended up doing. What really impressed me about this place though are the sides. We ordered onion rings and potatoes skins because we thought they would be small sides but they were ginormous!! We couldn't finish them and I ordered the smaller burger size possible! I would definitely come back. I also want to try their brunch... especially their breakfast poutine.Mmmm."}
{"text":"I guess it is a new place. I had the vegetarian devil's advocate mushroom burger. It was good and cheesy. I found it little cheesy from my side, otherwise for a vegetarian burger it was good!. My guy made his own burger and he liked it too. You should try the onion bun instead of normal bun, it is good! Worth to go with groups for once!"}
{"text":"I tried the JD's classic from the brunch menu. It tasted quite good. The toast had a flavor of cinnamon. That's a little bit surprise but in a good way. For drinks, I got orange juice, which is vey fresh. Then after meal, I took a latte. I forgot to stir a little bit before drinking...so...it was so bitter for the first try. But then it became more and more mellow and savory! I was so happy that I didn't throw it away in the beginning.  Lol."}
{"text":"The service as far as waiter/waitress was good. The kitchen service however was beyond slow. We waited an hour for 3 burgers and two poutines.   The burger was good, though I'm not the biggest fan of the \"pretzel bun\"- the poutine is not the greatest. When you think of a Montreal poutine the poutine you get here is not that.   It's my second visit - i decided to give it another shot and unless there's an occasion like birthday dinner or something that I'm invited to I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and the burger was amazing.  The deep fried mars bar was the cherry on top. I love how young people are managing that place in such an amazing way. Thumbs up for the girls"}
{"text":"Terrific burgers, fries and drinks. You can tell the meat is super-fresh as is everything else they use. Great casual and easy vibe and a great location on Sherbrooke street West in NDG's eastern side of town right before Decarie. They also have a terrasse which seems to be hopping during the summer months. It's got a bit of a hipster vibe to it but not annoyingly so. I came here for lunch but made a mental note to try to come here for brunch sometime, their brunch menu sounds amazing."}
{"text":"So glad this burger place opened in ville saint-laurent because we all know their isn't much good restos in this area. Not to mention a terrace. I ordered the classic it was very juicy and pretty good. Yes the meat could of used a little seasoning. Yes the buns were bigger than the patties. But nothing to say its a bad burger. Their secret sauce is delicious. My husband got the divine inspiration which is their version of big mac. He had same issues size meat versus size bun. And slighty overcooked seems its because the patty was smaller than the classic so chef must of left it same time. But he still enjoyed it. Burgers are priced individually. No combo. But the prices were very reasonable. Because the sides which range from 4-6$ are big enough for two even three people. Which makes it very reasonable when you order a burger and a frie or onion rings or sweet potato. Our table ordered all three and they were all very good. Service was great. And i was told they have their own ice cream machine and they make delicious milkshakes. So definitely will try that next time. We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Went with my son for dinner. I live in the neighborhood so we decided check it out. Just to start our waitress was very friendly. she explained the menu to us. Super nice. I love that. Me and my son ordered a hamburger he had a poutine I had potato skins. First off I have to say the best potato skins I think I've ever had in my life. It wasn't over cook it wasn't too greasy it was just right. They make their own sauce in house. which me and my son really liked. The hamburger was very good I love the bun was soft. The fries are fresh and not pre-frozen. Have a good time definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"An unusual place for me since I am a vegetarian, but they have a veggie burger, and although I've had better, I put so many topping on mine it doesn't really matter. They also have turkey burgers for non-red meat eaters. Their sweet potatoes are nice and the portions are huge, never finished my whole burger, nor a shared plate of fries. Service is a bit slow and Friday/Saturday evening are jammed and the wait is on top of many diners eating at tables near the door."}
{"text":"Not too impressed.   The menu looked fabulous and what we had was tasty but the portions were very small.  We basically had to order dinner twice and we're still hungry.   Slow service too.    The place was clean and there were a few other tables but it wasn't jam packed.    It would take a lot to convince me to give it another try."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by saying that I have been to Notre-Boeuf-de-Grâce many times before, for dinner, and have thoroughly enjoyed all my meals until now. Today my girlfriend and I decided to try it out for brunch. We had a terrible experience. My girlfriend ordered a breakfast sandwich that was described as coming with salami and a potato latke/pancake. I ordered 2 poached eggs on an English muffin with smoked salmon and a potato latke/pancake as well. It took 45 minutes for our orders to come. For brunch, no one should have to wait 45 minutes for their meal (we ordered no appetizers). We had also ordered right before a group of approximately 10 people who all ordered burgers and sides. Their food was first to come out (the wait staff dispute that we ordered before this big group, but regardless we waited 45 MINUTES). When our food did come, my girlfriend's meal came without salami and without the breakfast latke/pancake. Additionally, my meal (poached eggs) was cold, and the eggs were extremely overdone (more like hard boiled eggs). I also don't believe that my roll was a challah roll as described (I did not bring this part to their attention). When we did mention that the food was taking a long time, the staff were dismissive but courteous. Then when we mentioned all the missing ingredients, the staff offered us our beverage (one latte) free of charge. This was very nice of them to do so, however, with everything that went wrong, we should have at the very least been offered our meal at a discount. I can safely say that I will not be going back, for dinner or brunch, anytime soon."}
{"text":"Located in NDG, this restaurant caters to burger lovers but also offers a brunch menu. Service was a little slow but expected as the place was crowded. We didn't wait long to be seated. My date ordered The apocalypse, he said the portion was small and he prefers the burgers. I ordered the eggs Benedict, which comes with Salami and avocado but you can order the salami on the side. It was very tasty and they even provided me with almond milk for my coffee. I'm not sure I would go again as I don't eat meat and they had very few veggie options. Ambience was nice and it wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"I love their outdoor terrace in the back. It's sunny during lunch hours and pretty quiet. The food is very decent and reasonably priced. Good burgers and brunch options.   Service seems to be hit or miss. In general, I've been well served, except this one time the waitress gave our plate to another table and when it was partially eaten offered it back to us stating she could bring us what was missing from the plate..."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: More of a rustic little restaurant. It has a nice terrasse, I'd definitely recommend sitting outside when the weather permits it. P.S. The mannequin at the front entrance ALWAYS scares me, so beware when you're walking by.  FOOD: Call me crazy, but I got the salad. At a burger joint. And I liked it! My friend also got the salad and seemed to enjoy it. We also got the lychee sangria and it was really good as well. Next time, I'll be sure to come here to try a burger. I wish the portions were a bit bigger though.   PRICE: A tad bit expensive, but considering the area, I'm not too surprised.   SERVICE: The service was good. Staff are friendly and are efficient. They do what they have to do."}
{"text":"First impressions: Easy parking, good location, very casual, friendly atmosphere but small space with maybe 20 tables. Expect to wait a little before getting seated.  Now onto food and drinks: FANTASTIC. Its one of the most fun menus I have seen in a while. Endless choices of hamburgers since you can build your own or choose one already \"built\" If you're a sauce lover like I am, your mouth will salavate while choosing between the secret sauce, spicy mayo, Umami, ranch-chiptole...and the list goes on. The fun part about this place is that they have a \" Burger Of The Month \" so the variety is definitely A+.  The beer batter onions rings were absolutely delicious and so was my make your own burger.  The meat is melt in your mouth delicious BUT definitely not the place for you if you dont like your meat pink!  I like that they warn customers about the meat being pink on the menu. The choice of buns include : fresh bread, onion bread and lettuce wrap. The bread was indeed fresh and delicious. Perfect texture. The only thing I dont really recommend would be the fried pickles. Too much pickle to batter ratio - Ive had better!   There is not a big drink selection but definitely quality over quantity! I took the white sangria and it was great. My friends took a bloody ceasar and mojito and they were all fantastic as well.   The service : 5 star. Friendly waitress and very helpful with questions. Answered everything with a smile and some excitement. I think she loves the food too!   Conclusion : If youre in the NDG area and looking for an awesome burger and love your meat pink definitely try this place!  I know I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"C est bon et efficace . Il y a des burgers pour tous les goûts . J aime ceux à l avocat ! La terrasse est agréable les soirs d été . Un restaurant de quartier efficace ."}
{"text":"I liked the the size of the burgers, sweet potatoes ~(^-^~) and le ménage à trois. The service was great but they had forgotten one of my orders so I had to tell the waiter. The staff apologized and put the order on the house, yay! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I got what i expected : a good burger and good fries nothing more. Nice service, nice decoration, seems clean. Only 1 mix washroom .."}
{"text":"Burger love!   Fresh, juicy and cooked to perfection.   Prices are incredibly reasonable.   Selection of garnishes and sauces fab.    Follow their Facebook page to see what the Burger of the Month is - always worth the adventure."}
{"text":"I had the L'Orozo burger on onion roll. It was bland, although it looked like it had the potential to be tasty, but it was 'meh'. The place was okay, very casual pub-like. Went with my coworker. She had the tandoori burger, she said it was also just okay. We asked for any kind of hot sauce they had and they gave us Tabasco and this in-house made hot sauce that was supposed to be hot, but it taste more like crushed peppers and tomato paste, not hot/spicy at all. We also ordered the Poutine (which only comes with vegetarian gravy...odd for a place that does burgers), it was okay. The Deep Fried Pickles (appetizer) didn't come out until later and it was disappointing. The batter was not good. Overall, I'm not sure if i'll come back. The food was too bland for my liking."}
