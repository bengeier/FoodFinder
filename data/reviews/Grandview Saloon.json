{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time. Tuna was ordered medium rare, came out medium well. Pasta WAY overcooked. Do not need to ever come back. Plenty of other restaurants on Mt Washington."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for a view, a drink and a snack or lunch. I only had a Bloody Mary and the jalapeño crab dip but they were both amazing, as was the view of the city from the deck. Service was great."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp specifically to say this: The Grandview Saloon was one of the worst culinary experiences of my life.  I would rather lick the grease off the tracks of the Duquesne Incline next door than suffer through another meal here again.

The entire Grandview concept appears to be premised on the belief that as long as you've got a phenomenal view, you can charge inflated prices for food you'd be offended to find in a middle school cafeteria. In general, the food I saw was all-American in the worst possible sense - bland, slimy, and whenever possible, smothered with cheese.

In our case, the chicken marsala recipe eschewed the traditional topping for some kind of watery combination of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The shrimp scampi tasted as if it was prepared by a chef without a tongue. Our request for pita chips that were simply warm, not fried, elicited a significant delay from the kitchen, as if they couldn't figure out why any of their customers wouldn't want to slurp up something lathered in butter and oil.

Frankly, we should have run out the door the moment we sat down.  My brother-in-law aptly described the decor as a Days Inn ballroom circa 1995.  The walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them.  Of course, you've got an incredible view of the downtown skyline, but that's no excuse for such hideous decorative malfeasance.  After all, Vincent van Gogh didn't frame Starry Night in particle board he pulled from a dumpster.

If you've got even one iota of romantic feeling left after surveying what must surely be an accurate replica of Purgatory, the Top 40 hits from five year ago blaring over the soundtrack will surely kill the mood once and for all.  While you enjoy the strains of Pink's \"Get the Party Started,\" you'll be left munching on beer-battered blobs, silently wondering why your life feels so empty and numb.

To think that I paid almost $70 here for a two-person dinner that didn't even include alcohol makes me want to gnaw off my own pinkie with rage.  That experience would be tastier, cheaper, and far more pleasant than my time at Grandview.  However, my sacrifice will only achieve some higher meaning if I can serve as a warning to the rest of humanity.  For a great night out, check out the free view from the public observation point a few doors down, and then eat in literally any other restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Order was disappointing. Service wasn't around for awhile. Taste is very plain. Fancy on the menu but horrible in person. What was suppose to be a flat bread with fancy cheeses for $12 is a cheaply made pizza with canned tomatoes and kraft Parmesan. See pic."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fantastic view of Pittsburgh with great service and drinks, this is your place."}
{"text":"Simple food that takes an extremely long time to arrive. We had the slowest service I can remember. Moreover, it was pretty crappy, unapologetic service. I'll never go back. It's simply not worth it."}
{"text":"We use to love this place in the early 90's, this was the place to be seen and meet people, what a change.   Arrived at 7:00pm with my cousin from San Diego and
 what a disappointment.  Upon arrival was told the dining room was reserved for a party and the kitchen would be closed for an hour.  So we went to the bar to have a few drinks before dinner.  This place use to be standing room only with a deck offering an awesome view of the city, only about ten people here and took 15 minutes to get a drink, slow, lazy staff.  Drinks are pricey and after two drinks asked if the kitchen was open yet was told it has always been open , GREAT!!!  So I ordered a Reuben sandwich and sweet potato fries .   Never had such a bad Reuben, meat was shredded and was so salty it sent my blood pressure sky rocketing, horrible. Only ate half and waitress never asked how it was could care less I ate only one sandwich.  Asked for honey mustard for the fries didn't have any really.   Great view but service and food will make you wish you choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had the Whaler sandwich... The note on the menu says enormous piece of Cod and they weren't kidding!  Breaded very lightly it was quite tasty. The fries were ok. The homemade chips tasted great. 

The view over the city is spectacular. Right next door to the Incline so you can't miss the place."}
{"text":"It was a brutally hot day up on Mt Washington this past weekend. After going up the incline, we tried walking around a little, but it was just too hot to do anything. This is the first place we found where we could get out of the heat.

As far as bars go, this place is average at best. We didn't eat - just a few beers and soaking up their AC.

However, what a view! They have an outdoor balcony that looks right over the city. Even though the heat was killer, we had to suffer through it a little longer to just sit outside and enjoy the city view.

Definitely worth a stop just for the view."}
{"text":"After waiting at the podium for 5 minutes, the hostess finally comes out and greets us. We then tell her we have 6 and one child. Her response was \"sorry, we don't allow children under the age of 6, they're a liability.\" This is absolutely absurd. Every person stepping into the building is a liability... I have worked in the hospitality business for approximately 20 years and have never heard of such a thing. Pretty sure it's illegal. After leaving in disgust, we walked around to find out nothing else in the area was open at the time. If I could leave zero stars, I would. After reading many reviews, I'm glad I didn't waste my money. Do yourself a favor, keep walking. You can see the view at the top of the hill."}
{"text":"Very fresh food and authentic Italian taste. Tried the eggplant Parmesan and it was so awesome. My friend had portobello mushrooms burger which was also very good. The view of the Pittsburgh is scenic from the patio. Must visit when you come to Mt Washington."}
{"text":"Very impressed with everything this restaurant has to offer...and yes the food was incredible...the view was incredible. ..the staff was incredible... our party of 8 was more than pleased..."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and quick. The appetizers were delicious. Good selection of beer and wine and the view was great."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place was a huge let down.  Just because a business has a view they should not expect the patrons to settle for lack luster food.  The risotto was like a dry sponge.  I think they were trying to pass off the tablespoon of yellow liquid on the veal as hollandaise sauce.  The steak was fair.  If you want a quality steak you better head to Longhorn.  This was an overpriced dinner.  They should also think of investing in a decorator.  The dining room could use some wall decor.  Note to owner:  Pittsburgh is filled with wonderful artist. Go out on a sat to the artist market up there and buy something.  Not all your tables have the view of the city, give these people something to look at while they are waiting for their overpriced meal."}
{"text":"Scenario: you walk out of the Duquesne Incline and need a place to eat. Turn and take about 20 steps. Walk into the Grandview Saloon. Go upstairs for an awesome view by the window, or downstairs for a more informal, outdoor setting. Great food with rare, great prices up here. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughters graduation this past sunday and were very happy to have chosen the Grandview Saloon.

Our waitress Megan,  did a great job at keeping 11 of us happy for dinner.  I have to say that we tried at least 6 different meals and each and every one was presented beautifully, and tasted just as good.  We were very happy with our food.

Just wonder if people in pittsburgh don't drink pinot grigio..  or everyone does...  as  we drank their last 2 bottles.

The view was awesome as well.

I wanted to be sure and write a positive review..  thanks for taking care of us."}
{"text":"A friend and I got drinks here just so we can sit on the outdoor deck for the amazing view of the city. The cocktails there were average priced, especially considering the deck view. Definitely worth checking it out if you happen to be on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"Bartender Very Slow, shoving his face with liquorish.  Took 35 min to get an over priced Ruben."}
{"text":"Five girlfriends and I chose this restaurant as the starting point for a \"girls night out\" mostly because we wanted the view of Mt. Washington and the experience of riding the incline to/from and it was less expensive and more casual than many other restaurants on Grandview Ave. Well, it's true what they say - you get what you pay for. In general, this place seems to be confused about its persona. It kind of WANTS to be a fancy restaurant with the white linen tablecloths and tiny candle lamps on the tables, but there is very little ambiance beyond the view of downtown Pittsburgh. Even the menu is confusing. There seems to be a strange mix of \"fancy\" dishes and more low-key items such as sandwiches and wraps. The latter would seem appropriate on a lunch menu, but for dinner, I think they should stick to seafood and pasta, and apparently steak, since it's technically a steak house, or at least was in the recent past. (I don't eat steak, so if it was on the menu, I would've skiipped right past it anyway.) The menu was also small - perhaps only 15-20 total choices? Not one person at my table said that they LOVED their meal, leaving me to conclude that they don't really put much effort into their offerings. In my opinion, if you're going to have a limited menu, that's fine - choose a few select dishes and do them REALLY well. A smattering of mediocre choices does not make up for the rest that this place is lacking. Our server was very personable, but I believe overworked, (which is hard to understand, since the place isn't very big), which lead to an overall impression of not-that-great service. We had to wait quite a while for drinks, had to ask for the complimentary bread that we spied on other tables, and had to ask to have our tabletop candle lamp lit at dusk. Turns out, there wasn't even a candle in it - apparently they're just set on the tables for show. He did, however, graciously take back a glass of wine one friend did not like and replaced it with a much better selection. And upon overhearing another friend complain about not even being able to cut her tuna steak with a butter knife (it should not need a knife at all), he offered to have the kitchen prepare her a new meal and asked to take back the half of hers that was overdone so they could see just what was wrong with it. Overall, I will not be in a hurry to go back to this place for anything other than drinks on the outside patio if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Grandview Saloon, but mainly just for the view. They have an outdoor patio with an amazing view of the city. I love to go here just to sit outside and have a few drinks with friends. The service is hit or miss, depending on who your server is. I recommend to ask for Danielle if she's working. She is awesome! As for the food, it is overpriced and nothing to brag about, but the drinks are actually affordable. A bottle of beer is $4.50, which I think is pretty cheap for a place like this. I've never eaten dinner here, only lunch, but I'd like to try it sometime. I also like to recommend they open the deck all the way upstairs for people who just want to sit outside to enjoy the weather & view with a few beverages. If you are by the Duquesne incline looking for another place to enjoy the beautiful view of Pittsburgh, check out Grandview Saloon."}
{"text":"It was difficult to get someone to take our order, then after about 45 min our food arrived cold.  We sent it back and about 20 min later it came back about a third of the original portion and full of salt.  The view of Pittsburg was beautiful and the best part of the night"}
{"text":"The jalapeño crab dip was really good. Not on the health side at all, but I couldn't stop. The burger was over cooked not sure if it was frozen or fresh had a good grilled flavor though. View was really cool. Good spot."}
{"text":"Don't ever try their Strips! and the service is worse than the food.

The half of the tiny piece of the steak was fat and overcooked.
we got a fish and a New York Strip but this strip was just horrible.
The fish was mediocre. nothing special.
They tend to have overcook your steak generally so when we asked for a medium rare, it wasn't a surprise to see a well done steak.
But the portion didn't even seem like it was 12 oz (much smaller) and the fat was just grossly too much.
So we told our waiter that we were very disappointing and we dont want this dish anymore but he just kept making excuses that it is because of the way its cut and that much of fat is normal so he can't refund nor make a new steak since we already had some.
He ended up taking 10 dollars off for 2 beers but that was it. Not even for my drinks, just my boyfriend's since it was his food. No apologies, no attempt to make up for it, nothing.
Their filet mignon and tuna steak are what we usually get but it was just a terrible mistake to try something new; ended up seeing their worst customer service.
Never will I go back here or take anyone especially when there are so many restaurants with higher quality food and much better service for the same price with similar views (or less).
15% of tip I left was too much for their service."}
{"text":"The Grandview Saloon revels in the real estate phrase \"location, location, location\". The facility itself could use a decoration update but has an amazing view of downtown Pittsburgh.  It has indoor and outdoor seating high above the city.  Other reviewers seem to be expecting a finer dining establishment than the Saloon offers. The prices are a bit higher but again the location fee is built into your meal. I shared the pulled pork nachos with my companions and was pleasantly surprised by the dish.  We had a couple of drinks on a weekend afternoon after a ride up the Duquesne incline.  I'd recommend it for the view and a snack."}
{"text":"FYI... Although Yelp says its good for kids, it is not. There is a sign on the door at the hostess stand that says no children under the age of 6 are allowed."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and should have way more stars! Walked in got a window seat for four. Kayla took such great care of us.  The price was super reasonable for as much as we ate and drank. Everyone was like mines Soo good and I final shared mine towards the end! Everyone knew I got the best meal on this one! 
Best Porter house I've ever had!  I would order this cut more often if it tasted like this.  Rare n hot on hot plate."}
{"text":"I created an account so I could share the bad experience I had at Grandview Saloon.  Yesterday was my wife and I's first anniversary.  We decided we would go up to Mt. Washington and stare at the city while we eat/drink for our special occasion.  Monday, my wife called and made reservations for Thursday at 7:30pm and requested a table by the windows.  She was told that it wasn't a problem but there might be a 5-10 minute wait for a window table even with a reservation.  That' was no problem.

Being the punctual person that I am, I was walking through the door at 7:30pm.  Told the hostess that we were there for our reservations.  This is where it gets bad.   We were told that the people who had reservations at 6:30pm still haven't arrived and that we no longer have the option for a window table.  She told us they were a whopping HOUR late for their reservation.  She explained that the group was from Philly and got lost and stuck in traffic.  Who in the hell continues to hold a reservation when the group is over an HOUR late?  My wife was pretty disappointed considering we made reservations four days prior.

As for the food, it was pretty mediocre.  Lets just say you're not going for the food.  You're going for the view.  I got the homemade crab cake dinner with a Caesar salad and steak fries.  My wife got the salmon dinner with a side salad and french fries.  My wife said the salmon was pretty decent.  They had to send my plate back because someone plated the wrong sides with my crab cakes.  For being about $30 a plate, I expected the food to be a lot better.

As stated before and by a lot of other people.  Don't set your expectations high on anything other than the view.  That's what you're going there for.  I want to send a shout out to the group from Philly who arrived an hour late for their reservation and messing up mine."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaraunt in Pittsburgh for holding a reservation. The manager, Sue Getner, is completely responsible for cancelling a party for 75 people. Excuse used by Samantha was they didn't hear back from us. Well your email said and I quote, \"no rush... I have secured the date for you.\" Completely false! Maybe just maybe before you use the excuse that we didn't receive a deposit you should call or email us. Especially since we have had parties with you in the past. Never again....horrible place"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh with my wife, we were taken to the Grandview by her brother for lunch. The view is staggering, and the food was quite good, too. BIL and I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich--flavorful, moist, no fatty bits, and not overly sauced. My wife had the Veggie Pita Wrap and she was completely satisfied. 

However, the great find at the Grandview Saloon was the light, crunchy and tasty french fries. I'm usually a bigger fan of steak fries, but these thinner cut crunchers were outstanding.

Service was friendly, helpful and prompt. Obviously, the view is the reason for the restaurant, but they don't cheat you on the food (which wasn't overly expensive)."}
{"text":"The Grandview Saloon has one of the best views of Pittsburgh from Mt. Washington from its patio. The views from the interior of the restaurant are not bad either.  To go with your view, you can choose from a good selection of drinks and more mediocre Pittsburghesque (i.e., comfort) food. The design of the patio is fine, but the interior of the restaurant is very plain. This is a shame, because with a little work on the interior design and menu, the view could make this one of the city's most interesting restaurants. 

In short, I would not go here to celebrate an anniversary, but it's a good place to take first-time visitors to see the city while enjoying a tasty beverage."}
{"text":"Wow! This place had the nicest view of any place I've ever been too. I really loved and enjoyed it. The food is delicious and there really is nothing bad I can say about it. I'm new to the city and so far this is definitely my favorite place to spoil myself. The food is a bit pricey but with the view your gonna get its definitely worth it. You can literally see all of Pittsburgh. I highly recommend it if your new to the city or you want to take a date you want to impress. Also, you have to call and reserve a seat by the window, but even if you don't you'll still have a great view. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. I had the crab cake sandwich. It was, honestly, the best crab cake sandwich I've ever had. EXCELLENT"}
{"text":"I wanted a nice but causal meal to celebrate my new job with my dad and he suggested Grandview Saloon. 

I made a reservation for around 6:30 for two with no problem on a Saturday night. 

The set up of this restaurant is interesting with different levels and an outdoor section.  The kitchen is at the front of the restaurant when you first walk in with the host stand on the edge of the kitchen (interesting).  One of my only gripes is the decor in this place. I am not an interior designer or anything and not everything has to be super chic but this place is just bland.  White walls, two pieces of art, cheesy chairs. This place has so much potential just needs some CHARACTER! 

I was starving so I order their mushroom bisque (even though I never eat creamy soup) and it was heavy but delicious! I ordered the crab cakes and YUM! Big chunks of crab meat!!! Delicious and HUGE. 

I also had two bloody marys during the meal as well which were very spicy and tasty. 

My dad got their Banana Creme Pie Ice Cream which was AMAZING! Their list of interesting ice cream flavors was impressive (even my dad was impressed and he is an absolute ice cream connoisseur) 

PRO: Fast service, great food, a lot of daily specials, excellent desserts, outdoor seating

CON: $10 Parking, boring decor 

OVERALL: WILL BE BACK FOR SURE"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. The staff was awful and unapologetic. They spilled drinks across people as they were passing drinks. Multiple people ordered a special that came out cold and raw in the middle. They slammed the food down in front of people and were unapologetic about it. 
The drinks too forever to arrive and they even told us that they didn't put the order in until over 10 minutes after we gave our orders. They kept excusing the delay by telling us that they were packed - something that was NOT reflected in the amount of people around us. It took so long for them even to take our orders and the food took an unreasonable amount of time to come out. 
There was nothing redeeming about the visit except the view. I would avoid at all costs and would never recommend this place to anyone. They were unprofessional to a degree I have rarely experienced."}
{"text":"Best view of any bar restaurant in the world.  Terrible decor and average food. Looks like a high school kids basement. I do believe this place needs John Taffer and bar rescue BAD. Come here for apps and beer and bring a camera"}
{"text":"So where do I start...my ever pressing girlfriend picked this spot for our nye excursion. The menu looked pretty nice online and even had a few more options when we got there. We were quickly seated even without a reservation but unfortunately this is the end of the highlight. 

The menus were changed for nye and the options were very limited. Everything was about $15 more expensive and the things I wanted were off the menu. The jalapeño crab dip was exceptional and I wish that is all I ordered. 

Our server was ok and wasn't that talkative at all. I had the stuffed shrimp which ended up being just shrimp with crab on top. I had a side of the roasted potatoes. They were only 4......yeah; and they were cold and barely seasoned. 

overall it could be a very good restaurant but the portions are very small compared to the price. The experience did not match the price either. If you come back get the jalapeño dip and leave. 

The drink menu was very limited also. Not a good look."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great view this is a perfect choice. However, if you're  looking for anything more go elsewhere.  The service was incredibly slow; the food was mediocre at best. Too many other great choices to waste your time here."}
{"text":"Great deck view for late afternoon/eve drinks and dinner. Less cost than nearby other places plus you can sit outside here."}
{"text":"Couldn't get my tripod over the lookout deck, so figured we would have a few bites and a stable places for my camera for pics of pittsburgh. 

If you go during a weekday, we went on tuesday... there will be plenty of space out on the balcony. Sadly my pics didn't come out that great cause when someone walked, it shook the balcony slightly. Not good for long exposures. But... had a great view anyways. 

we had a few sodas and a salad. A bit more expensive, but considering the view... i'm suprised it didn't cost more. 

The staff were super friendly. I look foward to going back!"}
{"text":"The outdoor views from the deck are unparalleled - but the decor is seriously dated and somewhat dirty. Under the right management, they could crush it with locals and tourists. In fact, that's the case with the few neighborhood restaurant venues - they don't capitalize on the location.  That said, a must stop for drinks on the deck. Food is OK."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Pittsburgh!  Outdoor deck has best view in town.  Also the only reasonably priced restaurant on Grandview Ave. on the top of Mt. Washington.  We had beer and sandwiches, which were very tasty and reasonably priced.  Coconut shrimp was a delicious appetizer.  Whaler sandwich had fresh bread and very large cod filet.  Gyros were as good as any Mediterranean restaurant.  Enchanting evening.  A Steelers game was going on in Heinz field (pre-season)- we couldn't see the field, but could hear the crowd."}
{"text":"No way this is a $$ restaurant, I pay $45.00 for a bad stake, appetizer wasn't  grate ,it looks outdated inside, but the waiter was good guy :) that's why I give them 2  star :)"}
{"text":"The view is cool (although, the day we came it was hard to see, due to the weather). Everything else was average and expensive."}
{"text":"Decent prices, amazing view, good drinks and apps! Stop by here after riding the incline!"}
{"text":"I had just arrived to Pittsburgh and my friend and I rode up the Duquesne Incline to take in the gorgeous view on a warm September night. We considered having dinner in the Mount Washington area, but none of the restaurants looked all that attractive to us (no offense, but they kind of seemed like tourist traps). With that, we could see Grandview Saloon's outdoor terrace from the observation area adjacent to the Duquesne Incline Station, so we figured we'd amble over there for a drink. 

We were seated promptly and given a great table right at the edge of the balcony. Wow, the view is fantastic, especially at sunset time! The drink/cocktail menu offers your typical assortment of martinis, beer, wine, etc. I had a Ketel martini ($14) and my friend had a beer - The martini was nice and cold, and big, so a good value for what it was. It was a great place to unwind and take in the sights of Pittsburgh. It seems pretty popular overall, and their food did look good. A solid choice on Mount Washington for a casual meal or relaxing cocktail."}
{"text":"One helluva view and fantastic jalapeño crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!"}
{"text":"Great view! French onion soup was the best! Go here and watch the sun go down and the lights of Pittsburgh come on for an unforgettable experience. Service was the best, Shelley made us feel like we were the most important customer in the room. Great service, great food, great view. Couldn't be any better."}
{"text":"Grandview salon is a solid spot on the Mount.

The food selection leaves a little something to be desired. They have a menu that needs a overhaul. This place could do spot better in that regard.

To talk about the positive points of the place:

1) location - right in Grandview near the incline. Night spot for a drink/lunch/dinner.

2) wait staff - friendly and attentive

3) the view - you have a world class view of the downtown/north shore area.

In my opinion nice spot for a happy hour drink but I would grab food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good... you pay for the view though.  BBQ nachos were superb."}
{"text":"Great view of course but you pay for that. Food is surprisingly good. No kids under 6 allowed for some reason. Multiple tiers of restaurant and a nice deck. Certainly a place for first day of spring and a cold beer."}
{"text":"The view is fantastic, and the steak was ok.  My colleagues had terrible food.  The Buffalo calamari was so salty it could not be eaten by two of the people with me.  The coconut shrimp was burnt and cold.  The service was absolutely terrible, and I don't know why, because they weren't that crowded.  Will I come back?  Yes, because I want to give them another chance. I was here a couple of years ago, and had a much better experience."}
{"text":"Good casual place on the mountain if you are not in the mood for a fancy dinner. Always like their steak sandwiches. I think it is 12oz ny steak with sweat potato fries! Nacho is good too."}
{"text":"My experience started when I called for reservations for my wife's birthday. I called and I asked for reservations in the afternoon a few days before going. They took my name and number and said they'd have to check and call me back in an hour. I thought that was strange. After three hours, no call back. My wife meanwhile called and made reservations because that's what she wanted to do on her birthday. I called again and they said no problem. I asked about a window seat. Had to put $25 down to guarantee a window seat at our scheduled time of 6:30 PM. The fee gets refunded off your bill. It is to guarantee you come so I could understand I guess, views are limited.

We arrived and were promptly seated. The waiter was attentive and polite. I thought \"hmmm, good, maybe the bad reviews were full of it after all\" after reading reviews and checking here on Yelp and Google. We each received a soda beverage since we don't drink (I was driving, she doesn't drink). The soda was good, not watered down or funny tasting like some carbonated taps are. We both ordered Delmonico Steaks and salads as side orders. The salads came and were fine. Then our meals come pretty quickly. Great service! I thought. Then the bottom of the bucket fell out.

Her steak was done right, ordered medium well. Mine was ordered medium rare and was well. I can't eat a steak at a \"steakhouse\" that costs almost $40 as well done. I complained and they promptly re-fired me another. That one came out in a few minutes and was blue all through - rare. Sent back for a few minutes. Came back and although better was still more rare then medium rare but whatever, I'd rather it be more rare then cooked. The steak by now was pretty much ruined with vital juice gone and being a little tough. This was a $39 steak. unacceptable. I also ordered \"red skinned roasted potatoes\". I ended up with what I call \"Idaho fried burnt potatoes\" which were chopped up idaho potato that was fried or roasted to a crisp.

My main focus is on the steaks we ordered. Besides the atmosphere and decor not being very pleasant nor romantic - cafeteria style tables and chairs, crowded, not very pleasant - the steaks were plain bad. How dare they call themselves a \"steakhouse\". It is known and signed as Grandview Saloon and Coal Steakhouse. They couldn't cook a steak to save their life. The steak was half fat (I know Delmonicos have marbling but not this bad) and not charred. A \"real\" steakhouse normally puts a nice char on the outside. They did slap some kind of glaze sauce and garlic butter on it, which wasn't bad. Half the steak came home for the dog. 

So in summary, we treated this place as a steakhouse in which it is billed as. This could be farther from the truth. My steak wasn't cooked right twice. The decor is something out of a cafeteria. The view was stunning. Maybe if we kept \"cheap\" and ordered a sandwich instead it would have been better. This was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner with a romantic view of the city and turned out to be a dud. It was a $125 view. I left there still hungry. Although I would try a sandwich or something else instead I would not go back. Too many other good choices. As for the steak dinner, I'd go to Texas Roadhouse or Lone Star for a much better experience. The steaks are actually tastier there. One last thing, our waiter didn't even to offer a comp for the lousy steak. My bad for not pushing it. I just wanted to get the hell out of there and not ruin my wife's birthday any further.

Two stars for the view , salads were edible and soda was good. The waiter was attentive and polite. Other than that, save your money. As another reviewer stated called it: \"A tourist trap\". Shame on us."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh...great food and great service... have the Colossal Crab Cake Sandwhich...it really is Colossal  and DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Myself and five other people dined here on December 8th and while the view was fantastic everything else was left to be desired. Walking up to the restaurant I would have walked right passed it if someone in my party didn't point it out. The awing looked like it could have used some updating, there are no indication of it even being the restaurant unless you were looking at the old menu they have out front. Upon entering the restaurant we found it to be weird that the kitchen was located as soon as you entered the front door, we were then seated right away in the section of the restaurant that reminded me of someone's grandmothers house with paper napkin and all. Our table overlooked the kitchen and found the noise level to be very loud to hear the people in your party talking. The food itself was ok, everyone seemed to enjoy it but were put off by the table location."}
{"text":"Loved the view from the patio!!! Food was great too!! Am Definitely going to visit again."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here yet, but would give five stars for the view alone!  My dad and I went to the Duquesne Incline and then had some time to burn before his flight home, so we stopped next door at the Grandview Saloon for a beer and to hang out for a bit.

The patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.

I'm guessing there's more interesting food options in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd definitely stop here for the view again, especially with visitors."}
{"text":"The view here is fantastic, the staff is great, and the food is fabulous. I had the stuffed shrimp with crabmeat and they were colossal  shrimp with lump crabmeat stuffing, they were great and tasted so fresh, the wife had the filet salad which was great, if you want to impress someone definitely try it out here and eat out on the patio"}
{"text":"Wonderful way to finish the day! Stopped by after the game for a few beers and dinner. Waited around 5 minutes for a table on the patio. The view is perfect. The service was fast and friendly! I recommend Andrew highly. Grabbed the New York strip and a lemon shandy beer. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I took a group of 16 to the restaurant for lunch. The views are phenomenal and the food was excellent. The service was great, especially considering we were such a large group. It is really convenient to the incline. If you want to see Pittsburgh, go there and take the incline at least one direction."}
{"text":"Not a great place at all. Applebee's quality food and way to much in price for that quality. Had to try it, not coming back."}
{"text":"Great filet event better view. Definitely a great place to get the best view of Pittsburgh and some awesome food as well."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. I was in Pittsburgh just for a day and came here by accident, the views of Pittisburgh are amazing and the drinks were really good. 

I didn't get to try the food but I will make sure to come back here next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"What a great place for newcomers to Pittsburg. You certainly get a grand view and the food is delicious. We rode the incline which was a hoot tooI had the cream of gourmet mushroom soup and the french fry salad - apparently a new tradition in Pittsburgh or Penn. in general? Odd combination, but so were chicken wings and bbq sauce in Buffalo in the 70s! My husband had the sausage sub -- to fat to pick up! We were there early on a Saturday on a chilly day in April and could just imagine how fun it would be to eat outside."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Grandview Saloon to celebrate a birthday. We had made reservations for 730. We arrived right on time, but the hostess said that we would have to wait for a while since all their  reservations were behind from much much earlier in the day. We ended up waiting for over a half an hour. By the time we were seated, our waitress seemed very much disinterested in us. Food was quite delicious, but not before several of us were served plates of pasta that were cold. They had to have been sitting out for at least 20 minutes to be that cold to be honest. The food is good, but there are many places in the city that serve food just as well if not better and have good service on top. I would honestly think twice about eating here again."}
{"text":"The view is AMAZING! It's perfect for drinks with a view of Pittsburgh. I had the gyro and it was good, but it could be better. I found the food to be a little over priced. The staff was great though - especially the bar tender. I would suggest this as a place to get a cocktail, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"party of 2. had reservations for 630, arrived at 615 and were seated right away. when i called originally i asked for a seat by the window. they said they cant guarantee it but noted it and would try. we sat one  table away from the window, which still made for an amazing view. however the people right against the window were paying the bill and we asked if we could move over once they left. the server was very nice and said no problem after asking the host. this happened after we ate our salads. he busted the table quickly and made the little move very smooth and easy. the view is totally amazing. i ate here in the winter, and looking below at the deck, during the summer im sure it would be even a bit better. the food i have to say was a little disappointing. i heard the food is very good here, but i wasnt too impressed. my fillet was very avgerage, for an above average price. garlic mashed potatoes were decent. the salad with house dressing was way too small, it was tiny and pretty plain, i really liked the dressing though. the steak sauce that came with my fillet, which normally id never use any sauce, but i tried a bite with it, and the sauce was very good and i finished my steak using it. the 12oz sirloin was the other dish ordered and i finished her last 4 bites, actually, i had only 2 bites, as it was awful i thought. very tough and dry. she had green beans as her side which were ok. no dessert,. her two vodka martinis were very good and priced right as was my beers. its 3 stars because the service was good. our waiter was very nice and made the meal better because with his good service. and the view is unreal and the atmosphere and decor are very nice. although there is a tv mounted on the wall in the dining room which seemed very out of place. if it was on, it would kill the intimate, romantic vibe that it offers. maybe its there for the staff to watch while the place is closed?  because i couldnt see why it would ever be on any other time. the bar downstairs is very nice and you can still get the view. its pretty small, but a perfect place to have drinks before or after the meal. after tip it was exactly $100, which included 2 kettel one martinis, and 2 beers, no dessert.  overall i liked the restaurant, i liked the cozy feeling there, the big windows, friendly staff, i just wish the food was a little better as it was very average."}
{"text":"Drinking and being stupid with the knucklegraggers i work with...
Food was superb and Dortmunder on tap!!!
View of the 'Burgh was fantastic!!!
Has a GREAT time!!!"}
{"text":"I hate having to do negative reviews, but there's no way to sugar-coat it: our recent visit to Grandview Saloon was just bad.

We came on a Saturday night, after calling and being told that although tables inside were all reserved for the night, there would be seating in the bar and outside 'first-come first-served.'  So, willing to wait a bit for one of these famous-view tables, we went up and were fortunately able to immediately get a seat at one of the tables in the bar area.  No view of the city from there, but there was a good view of the Buccos game on the big TV, so we were happy with that.

Our waitress brought our drinks right away, and she took our order shortly after.  We were off to a good start, but things started to look a little dismal when the mushroom soup that we ordered hadn't shown up after about twenty minutes.  We had decided to split a bowl of the soup, an appetizer, and an entree, and then each ordered our own side salads.  (There was nothing on the menu to indicate you couldn't share an entree, nor was there an additional plate fee for doing so.)

Finally, after 45 minutes, our appetizer arrived.  We got the jalapeno crab dip, which was really good, and came with lightly fried pita triangles.  The dip was served still hot, so we figured that the kitchen was just backed up.

At this point, we noticed that our waitress was not only waiting on her tables, she was making the drink orders for all of her own tables, in addition to the drinks for those of some of the other waitstaff.  My best guess is that she was normally a bartender who got assigned to wait tables when another server called off, but never once did she say anything to indicate that they were short-staffed, or even say, \"Sorry for the delay, your food is coming out soon.\"  

Finally, after twenty more minutes, our food arrived.  As in, ALL OF IT arrived at once.  The soup, our side salads, and our 'entree' were brought to the table at once.  The soup was already at room temperature, and for a thick soup like a cream of mushroom, it has to be hot to not overwhelm you with the weight of it.  We each had a few bites and that was it.

We had ordered the grilled scallops entree, and at $26, I had expected more than 5 scallops and half a plate of French fries.  (The menu said 'roasted potato wedges,' but what actually arrived were the equivalent of the seasoned fries from the old Rally's restaurant - don't get me wrong, they were mighty tasty, but for 'roasted potato wedges' they were not what I expected).

We were just upset at this.  We really wanted to enjoy our dinner and take in the sights from Mt. Washington, but poor service and food quality just prevented that.  I am typically very forgiving of slow service during busy times, but I do kind of expect some, 'Hey, sorry, we're really backed up because of ___ tonight, it's going to be a little longer for your food,' from my servers.  Especially for the prices of the Grandview Saloon - the food here was not significantly cheaper than the meals at LeMont, but the quality, amount, and presentation of the food did not even come close to stacking up.

However, all of this said, I do believe very strongly in second chances, and if I were to receive a coupon or have a Groupon deal for the Grandivew Saloon, I think we would return just to see if we were there first on an off-night.  When it comes to paying full-price for a meal though, for now, I will be sticking to the Mt. Washington restaurants I know."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant to eat at on Mount Washington.  There are a few reasons for this.  First, this place doesn't pretend to be something its not.  It is not as ritzy as the Lemont or somewhere similar, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed.  My wife and I are both too loud to enjoy places like that anyways.  However, we do enjoy good food and a good atmosphere.  We like places that have bar food, but sometimes want something a little better.  This place is perfect for that.  

Another one of my favorite things about the place is how diverse the menu is.  It is rare to find a place that has a menu with both a $12 sandwich and a $50 steak.  Whether you want a juicy steak or a simple sandwich, everything is prepared wonderfully and tastes great.  Some of my favorite things to get here are the buffalo chicken dip, buffalo chicken sandwich, grandview burger, Crab sandwich, and the ribeye filet.  I have never been disappointed with any meal here.

On top of the great food, you cannot beat the atmosphere, especially in the summer when the decks are open.  The views are amazing and make for a great experience."}
{"text":"Super fun place with an amazing view of Pittsburgh!  The company was fantastic and the food was delicious.  Great service as well.  I wish we lived closer to this wonderful city!!! 

100 A+++"}
{"text":"Awesome patio and awesome view, just DO NOT GET FOOD. We had perogies, calamari, kielbasa, all bad. I asked the waiter where the perogies and Kielbasa are from, he said just the typical frozen restaurant mass distributor, in a city known for Polish food and charging astronomical prices for the view, they should be able to do better..."}
{"text":"The view is second to none. That being said this place is a little bit of a novelty because of it. The food is not the focus here. It is a place you come to eat something and enjoy the VIEW. 

We ordered some sandwiches and although they werent terrible... but they werent anything to write home about. The grilled cheese and tomato bisque was bland the tomato bisque was grainy and lacked flavor. The other people in my party had no complaints about the sandwiches. Just standard fare.

I will say the homemade potato chip were crispy and delicious and I would recommend ordering those. The fries were also solid. 

Solid 2.5 star place... I bumped it to 3 bc we had a good time. Come and enjoy the view but dont expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"First time here believe it or not.  I am thinking I need to come back and try the bar.  We came in at 6:25pm on a Tuesday.  Our food arrived at 7:00pm after I went and put more quarters in the meter.  I got a crab sandwich that was average at best.  My wife got a prime steak sandwich which was also average at best.  Oh the view was great!  I guess that's what we paid $48 for.  I will try it again and follow up."}
{"text":"The buffalo calamari was great for an app.  I would skip the salads and jump into an entree and cocktails.  Portions are big so you could almost order an appetizer and 1 entree and split it. Food prices are high for the restaurant but you are paying for the amazing views over the city.  $7 for top shelf alcohol is worth it.

Nothing fancy but a nice place to chill and even better when you can sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, mediocre service, at the table for an hour and 10 minutes and after a $350 bill they asked us to finish our drinks at the bar after only being at the table for an hour and because they said they have another reservation. Oh by the way we had a reservation too. 

Hard Pass!"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL VIEWS. Food was also super good while the vegan options are pretty limited. I made it work with a modified salad, which was GREAT. The prices are on the high side, but for that view, it was totally worth it. The inside could use some updating, but it totally fits the Pittsburgh vibe. This was my second visit, and I'll be back! The only bad thing is the terrifying drive up! Being from the Midwest, I'm not accustomed to those steep streets. I wouldn't do it in the winter. If it's a nice day out, I highly suggest parking below and taking the incline railroad up!"}
{"text":"1. Great location. Great view. (Wish we couldve been outside)
2. Had the French onion soup which was pretty good, but kind of pricey.
3. Service was okay.
4. Overall, a good place to stop for a beer after checking out the incline down the street."}
{"text":"Awesome view and service.  Not too pricey for a Grandview restaurant"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and stopped by about 4pm on a Thursday - no wait for a table on the great deck with a view of the city and rivers!  We only got drinks, and they were good.  Service was OK.  If the view wasn't so good I'd probably only give 3 stars, but it was a beautiful day to sit outside with a drink and the view."}
{"text":"The view was phenomenal. The service was actually really great too...he let us split the check even, for a group on 9. Unexpected, but wonderful, particularly since not everyone brought cash. The food...

Ummmmm....it's ok, I guess. The fries are good. I got the French onion which was clearly the bottom of the pot and had been simmering all day long. It as way too thick and way too concentrated. I couldn't eat it. I was really disappointed.

The mezze platter was good, but nothing too special. 

I probably won't go out of my way to go back, but might go back, steering clear of several menu items."}
{"text":"The deck at Grandview Saloon has the best view of the city for sure!! I will only go if I can sit outside, and I will only go for drinks only. I actually ate before I left the house because I knew I didn't want to eat there lol. The food is not that great, but it is very expensive. $14 for a burger and $19 for a crab dip appetizer! You also have to hike up 2 flights of stairs to get to the restrooms. Also, this place can be hard to find because the outside is labeled Coal Hill Steakhouse... not Grandview Saloon (not sure what that's about lol)
However, I still had a nice time on the deck! I was there with a party of 10 and the service was very good! The tables are bolted to the deck so we couldn't move them, but we kept taking chairs and moving them around a big table, and no one seemed to mind. There was a team of 2 servers, and they both worked diligently to refill our waters and replace our beers! 
I'm sure I will be spending many summer afternoons to come on the deck of Grandview Saloon!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place! VERY RARELY DO I GIVE A NOT SO FLATTERING REVIEW BUT:  I called for a reservation and the man that answered the phone was extremely nice. He told me the Patio Seating was first come/first serve. Since it has been inclement weather, I got a reservation for window seating for 7PM. When we arrived, the Hostess told us our table would be ready in a few minutes. She came into the bar to tell us it would be a little longer. That was fine. The view is gorgeous and we took some beautiful pictures of Pittsburgh. The Hostess brought us to our table and that's when everything went SOUTH. Our Waitress, Kayla, wanted to go home apparently. She asked if we were OK with water (that was already on our table) but we wanted a drink from the bar and to enjoy the moment.  We lived in Pittsburgh for a while and we were back in town to do some renovations. We worked very hard for over a month and this was to celebrate our hard work was finally finished. Kayla brought our drinks, asked if we were ready to order...we knew we wanted the French Onion Soup (DELICIOUS) so we started with that. She came out of the kitchen with a tray on her shoulder and our soup in her hand. As she passed our table, she handed the soup to my husband and kept going. Well OK, she had her hands full but this isn't Carson Street!!  My husband had a few sips and passed it to me to try when Kayla walked over and asked if we were ready to order our food yet. I had just taken one spoonful of the soup and I said no but my husband said yes...Kayla ignored me so he ordered. (What waitress takes an order when the entire party isn't ready? Yes, there were only two of us but 50% of us were not ready. OK move on!) By this time, I was getting upset since we came for a nice relaxing evening only to be rushed. We ordered the $50. Porterhouse Steak (MEH- just OK, not  what I was hoping for) and a Crab Cake sandwich (since there is an $8.00 Sharing charge we got both items). I caught her on her way by to ask for some bread. When she brought it, she asked \"How is your food tasting?\" WHAT? Who says that? Then she started sweeping the carpet around us while we were eating. GROSS!! Our bill was well over $150.00 after parking and the bar bill. I asked for a doggy bag for the steak bone and Kayla handed me a little styrofoam box. I asked her if she had anything bigger but no. Weird...you sell a 24 oz. Porterhouse. It is such a shame that this one waitress spoiled the whole experience. If she wanted to go home she should have gone! Is there any FINE DINING in Pittsburgh?? Kayla should work on Carson Street where no one cares if you sweep under their feet. We thought this would be special but it was very disappointing...and all because we had a rude waitress. Too Bad! My husband still tipped her, his usual, over 20% because he worked in the restaurant industry. The thing is, even though we don't live here anymore, we still have a voice; Thanks to Yelp!! Also, we don't have small kids but if you do: ASK ABOUT THE NO KIDS POLICY BEFORE YOU GO!! I gave them 3 Stars...one for the guy on the phone, one for the Hostess and one for the view!"}
{"text":"The view from this place is to die for. I expected the food and drinks to be mediocre because they have that view but the cucumber basil gimlet was fresh and fantastic, Greek salad, chips and gyro were quite good. Service was friendly and fast. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a Christmas dinner with family. The dining area is separated by an upstairs and a downstairs area. We sat in the downstairs area which was awesome because we where right up against the window, and that's what really sets this place up.

The views of the city at night are absolutely amazing! We had a larger group of ten but the waitress was great and handled it with ease. She kept the drinks flowing and everyone was happy. The food was great and everyone at the table liked what they had. My wife splurged and got the New York strip. It was pricey but she absolutely loved it. I had the stuffed chicken Parmesan and it was delicious. 

The only complaint we had was the the bar downstairs was closed. Not the worst but would have been nice to stay after the meal and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"I took the incline up on a beautiful fall day, and decided to try out the crabcake sandwich and a local brew while watching the sunset. It was not crowded, so I got a table upstairs by the window, and very much enjoyed the beer while waiting for the food to arrive. My server was busy but very friendly, advising me on the different beers they had on tap. My sandwich was good, full of crabmeat, and maybe even a little too big as I didn't finish it all.
I lingered over another beer just after the sunset before taking the incline back down the hill. I recommend this experience, especially if you can hit an \"off\" time so that you can sit by the window."}
{"text":"Great for a date night! The food was great, and the view was even better! The location is great right next to the Duquesne incline. The staff was wonderful. We got the coconut chicken and the steak, and both were perfection. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We rode the Duquesne Incline and decided to get some lunch at the top on a Tuesday.  Personally, I wanted to try something local instead of the usual chain suspects down at the bottom in the \"Fake Town.\"  This was our only choice really and I was not sure what to expect because the outside on the street level is pretty plain and non-descript.  Got an amazing seat on their awesome deck and felt right at home.  Friendly staff, great beer selection, awesome interior and exterior dining options, and a nice local vibe.  The food (Caesar and Chicken Salad, Calamari) was fresh and well prepared.  A good crowd too for a Tuesday at 1pm.  Decent prices and good value.  Thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"A great place with a lovely view. This place is slightly expensive, but the given the view of the city and the quality of food delivered by them, it is totally worth the money. I tried the salmon stuffed with crab for the first time. I would definitely try that again. The bread they serve (which is complementary) was warm and it looked like it came straight from the oven. Loved the experience."}
{"text":"I have had a terrible time at this resturant. The service was bad. The food sort of edbile. I had tried to complain, however no manager on staff. Have phoned several times and they put me off. So here I am telling you of the bad experience I had. I am in business for myself and if I handled it this way. I would be out of business. Plus they do not have handicap access which is totally wrong. I am very sad and can tell you I would never go again."}
{"text":"Lets's face it, the real reason to go here is for the view.   The food is just OK and overpriced.  We three stopped for appetizers and drinks in the middle of the afternoon.  The Bloody Mary and the espresso martini were very good.  The glass of Chardonnay, for the price was a lousy pour.

We ordered the coconut shrimp, which was over fried, but fortunately served with a tasty sauce which helped.  We also had the spinach dip, which was served with a great warm pita bread.  The cheese plate had a nice variety of cheese and crackers, served with a spicy mustard sauce.

Overall, nice experience, since we did it for the view, but prices are way high, so not a place I would ever go just to have a meal."}
{"text":"This establishment offers the atypical view of Pittsburg and the confluence of the three rivers (the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the start of the Ohio). Prices are twice what they should be for the meals and drinks offered but after all, you are paying for the view."}
{"text":"Great view of the city, the staff here is so nice and does a great job!  Good selection for beers if your in to craft beers"}
{"text":"They exercised their right to refuse us service because we were accompanied by a child under the age of 6. I'm exercising my right to Yelp them 1 star. Consequently, we found our way to Bigham Tavern, dropped $100, got fat and drunk and had a blast!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! Pricey but your paying for the view it is one of the best views in town"}
{"text":"The view is wonderful, but for something on Mount Washington, with Mount Washington prices, I definitely had higher expectations. I came here with a party of seven last night, we ordered two bottles of the house white and a couple glasses of the white sangria, pulled pork nachos and calamari to start off with. 

I wasn't too hungry, so I thought I would get the \"artisanal cheese and fruit plate\". Cheese plates are my default choice at somewhat upscale-restaurants. To my dismay, this is what I received: cheddar cubes, old/brown grapes and a hunk of greek yogurt cheese. Unacceptable. Only come to the Grandview Saloon for the view and overpriced drinks."}
{"text":"OH MY GAWD. I am giving 5 stars just for the view. Its beatutiful and  so romantic. Infact while we were dining there, a guy was proposing to his girlfriend sitting on the window table.
They have three levels, with level 1 having an outdoor seating as well and the whole restaurant overlooks the whole Pittsburgh downtown. There are couple of other restuarants I am guessing with similar view.

Anyway, I had the sausage hogie which is chefs special and loved it. I think everyone in Pittsburgh or visiting Pittsburgh must visit this place once, but remember to make a reservation for the windows seats. They are in high demand."}
{"text":"Hubby and I played tourist when his parents came to town. We rode the Duquesne incline up from Station Square and nabbed the last table by the windows, even though we didn't have a reservation. The wait staff seemed harried but nice. We enjoyed our pear and spinach salads (MIL didn't like the dressing as much as I did), Rueben, and burger. The fries in particular were a big hit. Prices are a little high, but that goes with the view. We may come back in the summer to sit out on the deck."}
{"text":"This place has a great outdoor deck, with a million dollar view of the city. Unlike some of the other spots on Mt. Washington, the food and beer here is affordable. Food is average, a mix between bar food and upscale dining. That said, their dessert is the best thing on the menu. Try the triple chocolate tower cake, it's amazing."}
{"text":"I do love this venue so very much.  There are other restaurants nearby to overlook the city from Mt. Washington, but this one is affordable and has outdoor seating.  

On this particular Sunday, we travelled up the Monongahela Incline, and walked the approximately one mile to this restaurant next to the Duquesne Incline as we like the viewing stands near the Monongahela but like this particular restaurant to enjoy the view.  

It was surprising that at 11:50am on a Sunday with high 70's temperatures and partly sunny skies, there was not one person already outside on the terrace.  For that matter, there was not one person inside on that level, either.  No matter.  Good for us to have our choice of tables right next to the rail and views.

Our server was attentive, pleasant, and efficient without being intrusive to our chatter and experience.  As usual, we brought an out-of-town guest here to bask in the Pittsburgh scenery.  We opted for drinks and appetizers this go-round and they all hit the spot and were both flavorful and eye-catching.  We ordered some hummus and pita, as well as the jalapeno crab dib and pita.  Definitely winners."}
{"text":"A wise man once told me, \"all of life's disappointments come from failed expectations.\" Nothing truer has ever been said, and that statement also applies here.

OK, OK, I'll admit that when I first entered the place, I was concerned by the decor as well. A glance at the enormous menu offering what appeared to be a mundane slew of tired old \"American Food\" items left me a bit melancholy as well. I think that I am a bit less critical because these two first impressions set the bar a little low for me.

BUT... the draft beer was nice and cold, the staff working up on the deck that night were very attentive and friendly, and the gyro I ordered was... AWESOME! (One of the wait staff recommended it, saying it was probably the best thing on the menu.) Forget $50 porterhouse steaks here - why the hell would you do that? Go to Morton's, Capital Grille, or Ruth's Chris if you want to spend a fistful of money on some muscle to gnaw on.

I would disagree with the 5 star (?!?!) and 1 star reviews here. This place isn't The French Laundry on Mount Washington OR Pittsburgh Food Hell Meets Third World Inflation... It is a place with a great view and some tasty items you have to sort out from the rest of the \"Bennigan's meets TGI Friday's meets Applebee's meets Bar Food\" stuff. If you have the time and the patience, give the place a try if you are in the vicinity. Hopefully you will visit on a good night, and the view will make up for most of the shortcomings you may encounter.

And remember to set your expectations appropriately - the Michelin reviewers will never set foot in this place. You know that. Sites like this can help too - read what people are saying..."}
{"text":"The views, the food, and a great place to be when Pittsburgh does fireworks off the point."}
{"text":"If it's a warm day you can find me sitting on the deck at Grandview Saloon enjoying a drink and the amazing view! I absolutely love sitting on the deck here! I have been numerous times but it's strictly a place I come to get drinks. Beers are decently priced. I've had appetizers a few different times and they are always good just overpriced and nothing special. I've never been for dinner. The inside decor is a little outdated. If you sit on the deck the restroom is a bit annoying because you have to go up 2 flights of steps. I will say the service is always good. I just recently came with a party of 10 and they were very accommodating with our seating arrangement outside. It's right by the Duquesne incline so if you're on Mt Washington and want to sit back and take in the amazing view I defiantly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"The restaurant upstairs is horrid. Chrome tables and chairs, overpriced non imaginative food, dirty carpet, and slovenly service. The bar is ok if you stick with sandwiches and appetizers. Had an excellent steak sandwich the other day, however I was appalled by a notation on the menu that they charge $12 to split a meal. Go to Altius if you want an awesome dinner, or to Vue 412 for lunch."}
{"text":"if you're going here go for the view, the food is just OK but the view is great. I think a good thing about it, is it's not that expensive compared to other restaurants up there with the same view."}
{"text":"I grew up in Pittsburgh and now live in Georgia.  When I come home I quite often make a trip up the Duquesne incline and eat at the Grandview Saloon.  So, when I was on an executive board that was planning a conference in Pittsburgh and we needed a cool place to take 35 life members for lunch I immediately thought of the Grandview saloon.   The all glass front overlooking the Point and three rivers convergence is spectacular in itself.    Sue was great to work with from the start.   The day arrived and everything was perfect!   The food was excellent.  The group had Reuben's, crab cakes, fried Cod sandwiches, pear salads, etc.   EVERYTHING was excellent to a tee! Not one complaint from this vocal group!  The only thing I'd change was the requirement of one check for the group   Since we were doing this dutch treat This could have been a nightmare (I brought extra cash just in cash we were short). But we came out within 60 cents of the total bill!  That was a first! (Grin)   I was so pleased I brought the executive board back for dinner on Friday night to celebrate a successful conference. The brightly lit city was beautiful, Including a full moon which i ordered just for us!  Again, it was excellent with no complaints from this very tired group!   Crab cakes, gyros, Reuben's, Etc were all good.  The mushroom soup was a Gilled masterpiece, that with a salad, could have been a meal in itself.  We had two waiters for the 35 people and they kept in top of things well!   Couldn't have asked for a better experience either time!   I won't hesitate to go back next time im in town!"}
{"text":"WHAT A VIEW! 

Sunset here is beyond words. Especially when paired with a local beer. When it gets dark, go inside for some spicy crab dip. It is a little expensive, but very tasty. Just what a chilly night in Mt. Washington deserves!

I did not go to the main restaurant, but it looked really busy when I left. 
The location could not be better (right next to the D. incline.)"}
{"text":"We went back before another Steeler game and this time I got the crab-cake sandwich. Awesome is the only word to describe it. And did I mention the view???"}
{"text":"Grand VIEW - that just about sums it up. The only other thing worth mentioning is the price."}
{"text":"The very best filet I have EVER had!  Breathtaking views.  My husband had the rib eye and could not stop raving about it!  Large portions, good service!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"With a deck location and a view of the city this good I didn't expect a whole lot from the menu offerings but boy was I wrong. We were there for lunch. We sat outside on the deck. We ordered the Grandview gyro, made not from gyro meat but from slow roasted leg of lamb. The gyro was wonderful. The Tzaziki  sauce fresh made. Unbelievably flavourful. We also had a Ruben sandwich. Thick sliced marble 
 piled high with lean corned beef, sauerkraut and topped with thousand island dressing. We also had a bowl of tomato bisque. Thick and creamy. The Grandview lives up to its name but also has great menu offerings."}
{"text":"So flash forward 30 hours. Here I sit on Market Square downtown, a mere 1 mile from the Grandview $aloon with a shaker pint pour of Pumking, for which you will recall from WTF #2 I was charged 11 freakin' dollars. How much did this 14 oz. shaker pint of the exact same beer cost? $7.00. 'Nuf said. I mentioned Grandview's price to the bartender, who is still laughing at me. Buyer beware, I suppose..."}
{"text":"Its a Saloon first off and yes I like to drink. So that's a win in my book. And they have an incredible view of Pittsburg. A city with way too many bridges. Apparently Pittsburg has two less bridges than Venice but as they say here, \" our are made of steel, you know real bridges. Not those small little Venice bridges.\" Im not really sure what any of this means unless you are holding some contest on bridges which apparently everyone in Pittsburg is. 

So the view is unmatched and the drinks are decent. Just get a beer and a shot take your picture and go back down the Incline."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude, was told we'd have a table with a view when we made the reservation and when we got there that wasn't the case. Food was average at best, not worth the money"}
{"text":"Tourist trap. Like a bad cafeteria on top of Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"The view was amazing! The restaurant atmosphere and food not worth the price. We had a party of nine and of all of the meals, only one was really worth mentioning, which were the scallops. The ribeye steak was overcooked, the mahi-mahi was also overcooked and dry. They also charged an additional eight dollars for two young children to split one meal, which was a $26 plate of salmon.  Again you can't beat the view, it was absolutely beautiful but this place is absolutely not worth the prices that they are charging. Even when we had a problem with our food and asked for a manager, we were told there wasn't even a manager on site and it was a Saturday evening.  You can definitely find a better!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the city but food and service were just ok.  Server not knowledgeable about menu.  Food was salty too."}
{"text":"worth it just for the view!  It's just to your left after you get off the Duquesne Incline.  Go at sunset!"}
{"text":"Great view and I'm sure perfectly fine if you just want some drinks.  But I found the food to be lacking. I ordered the burger (allegedly filet mignon) cooked medium.  It was ABSOLUTELY served to me well done and it was barely seasoned.  The best part of the meal were the french fries, which definitely isn't a good thing. The mushroom soup was also okay, but the portion size was out of control.  

The server was very sweet and comped 1/2 the cost of the meal. But I still doubt I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"First the good news:  we walked in and got 2 seats at the corner of the downstairs bar.  Now the bad:
My wife's Cosmo was warm, maybe because it sat too long before the bartender served it.  It tasted as if it were missing ingredients, such as liqueur and lime.
My basil gimlet was the worst I've ever had.  It wasn't cold, and tasted like basil flavored water.  I watched the bartender muddle the basil, but couldn't see what else he was doing since he was mixing at the back of the bar.  He let it sit while he did other things at the bar and out on the deck.  I asked him if it was still cold-he said \"yes.\"
All in all, I made 2 mistakes:
1) I didn't watch to make sure he added gin, lime, and syrup.
2) I didn't send the drink back.
I won't make the mistake of going back."}
{"text":"Like anywhere in this city, it is a chore to drive there.  Parking was next to impossible and after that the place is CLOSED"}
{"text":"Everybody suggested that we go to this restaurant for the view. I should have realized that nobody talked about the food. The drinks are weak and way overpriced. The staff are mostly yongsters who are pleasant but young. The place is clearly understaffed. The bartenders are horrible, the food is average and the place is expensive. I would go up to the mountain, take some photos and leave."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a Valentine's dinner. Heard the view was amazing and that was the only thing that didn't disappoint. First off, the place needs a total redo. It looks like it's stuck in the 90s. Second, the wait staff was alright, not the best. Our waitress was accommodating when I was served sour wine but then dropped the ball when she brought the 18$ appetizer out with our entree. Last, the food was meh. Nothing special but for the prices they charged the food was ok at best. I wish I could say I liked it better, but, I won't. I will not return."}
{"text":"Do not go here The service is terrible and my Gyro tasted like crap I took one bite out of it and didn't like it and they did not want to refund me my money  The server was nowhere to be found"}
{"text":"Berry Long Island iced tea was delish, as was their cheesesteak. Breathtaking view on the deck. Loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grandview Saloon is only Grand for their view.  We sat in the upstairs dining room over looking the city.  I was surprised this was not an open air space, specially since we were dining in August.  Minus 1.

Since we had a large enough group, we ordered 3 appetizers, calamari, bruschetta, and another fried dish.  The calamari was good, but nothing I haven't had at many places before.

I was not in the mood for a meat dish, so I ordered a pasta dish.  I inquired about how heavy the sauce was (it sounded like a white wine sauce and I wanted to make sure it wasn't a cream sauce).  The server assured me it wasn't too heavy.  I was presented with a plate of pasta for a family of four, with some vegetables mixed in, doused with a mound of creamy white sauce.  Much to my disappointment, I could only eat a small portion, and since we were going out after dinner I couldn't take anything to go.

I visit Pittsburgh a few times per year, this is one place I will not be returning to."}
{"text":"worst place in pittsburgh. Can't even cook a steak. don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Let's be clear on what the four stars are for:  the ability to sit outside, look out on one of the finest views you will see anywhere of a city, and drink a beer.  Period. 

The Grandview Saloon offers several floors of dining and drinking.  The food, if I remember was probably two-three stars, but to be honest, I haven't been there since it got cold.  I think there was a new manager starting who was interested in introducing better wine and food so things may have changed since I was last there in the fall, but either way the service was always friendly and again, the views great.  

It's also been surprisingly easy to get a table outside the times I have gone there--I would have thought this place would be packed all the time. 

Another nice bonus is that it is located next to the Duquesne Incline.  I enjoyed giving out-of-town guests a chance to catch the incline and then have a drink there at the top before heading back down.

I look forward to warmer weather soon and getting chance to head back up there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to eat when we visited for 4th of July weekend.  I was shocked that we were able to get a seat immediately outside on the gorgeous deck.  The view is insane.  If you get there around the time of the sunset which we were lucky enough to do, it is spectacular.

The food was pretty good as well.  I got the coconut chicken and potatoes which was excellent and a unique option.  My boyfriend got the stuffed chicken parm (which wasn't really stuffed, it was pretty much 2 pieces of chicken parm with ricotta cheese sandwiched in the middle) but either way he enjoyed it.  The grilled chicken nachos were awesome as well.  

The only thing I have to say to people going there is that beware that there are two inclines; the one that you take from Station Square, the Monongahela Incline, doesn't bring you near this restaurant.  The other incline, the Duqesne Incline brings you right by it.  We didn't know this and took the Monongahela Incline up and we did walk to the restaurant but it was a bit of a long walk on a hilly road.  

Overall it was a great experience and one of the best parts of our trip!"}
{"text":"Sat on the outdoor patio on a clear, sunny day and enjoyed a stunning view of downtown Pittsburg above the converging rivers. The calamari was good, suggested that an option of sauce be offered. The remoulade sauce which came with my grandson's crab cake sandwich was terrific with the calamari!"}
{"text":"Made reservations two weeks in advanced requesting seats with a view, they seated us without one, then a table became available with a view, and they gave it to some people who did not have a reservation and told us simply \"sorry\" - the food is absolutely not worth your money; the purpose of this place is the view, which they don't accommodate even if you plan in advance for. Go to Altius or Monterey bay - significantly better food and service."}
