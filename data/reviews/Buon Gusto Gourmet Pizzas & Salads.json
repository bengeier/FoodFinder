{"text":"Great service, and good food. They have one of the best gluten free menus that i have yet to see!!! A little pricey however.  If you're an onion lover, they have terrific caramelized onions."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My friend and I decided to try this place after all the great reviews. We had the spinach and artichoke dip, the pear and Gorgonzola salad and the puttanesca pizza. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant, efficient and friendly service (Maura), definitely good food. Will go back. Might become my \"Monday lunch before tennis destination\"."}
{"text":"I read in the New Times last night that the owner of Picazzo's is re-opening this place as a Picazzo's in October. It was a Picazzo's until about 2 years ago, when it closed briefly and re-opened at Buon Gusto. So, Picazzo's-Buon Gusto-Picazzo's.

Buon Gusto was real good. But I have serious doubts about Picazzo's. Nearly every Picazzo's I have been in has crashed and burned. The ones in Surprise, Tucson, Tempe ... all gone, gone in a blaze of bad service, high prices, rude employees and nonresponsive management. 

Here's what you can expect at Picazzo's, unless the owner decides to do things right this time:  Rude hipster waitstaff in earhoops and greasy hair that roll their eyes when you ask simple polite questions. Lengthy waits for food with lame excuses when it doesn't come out and then arrives burned 45 minutes after ordering. 

Getting the wrong food. Management that doesn't believe you when you point out that you've been given 2 completely wrong pizzas tonight - not just a little wrong, but completely, not even close to the pizzas your ordered. Then the manager will try to guilt you into paying for one of the pizzas you didn't order. Meanwhile you had nothing to eat tonight. Annoying game-playing with happy hour. Picazzo's happy hour was neither cheap nor happy. Wow, a dollar off a glass of wine! Half-price apps that are half the size as your regular apps! And you can only have happy hour if you sit on the patio or at the bar! Go ahead and write the management about your concerns and complaints, even corporate management. You will never hear a peep back from them.

***     ***     *** (old review below)

An Italian-American restaurant with organic and gluten-free options, located in South Tempe.

This place is considerably better than its previous incarnation as Picazzos. Picazzos had problems with rude service and epically botched orders. Many people in the celiac community avoided this location and grumbled about it in private conversations. I am happy to report things are much much better.

The menu is similar to the old, with some additions - there are pizza, pasta dishes, apps including wings, artichoke dip, etc. There are also desserts. All menu categories have multiple GF options.

The service was friendly and reasonably attentive, and the food was served on time and at proper temperature. Everything was tasty in our party of 3, including wings, baked brie, a salad, pasta and a pizza. Salads are served in large portions, so don't over-order. Baked brie is sorta odd. Not bad, but not a favorite. It melts and runs all over the serving dish. If you love brie, by all means, try it out. If you're on the fence about hot brie, best to eat something else. 

In sum, I think you can expect to have a pleasant meal with tasty gluten-free Italian food and attentive service here. I wish the place well."}
{"text":"Buon Gusto has closed as of August 31, 2013.  It has been announce that it will reopen a Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen in early October."}
{"text":"If you liked Picazzo's, then you'll like the new Buon Gusto.  It's the same people, the same interior, and a very similar menu.  The pizzas are a little more 'gourmet' than your typical 'joint'.  It's someplace to go when you want pizza but want to go out somewhere a little nicer.  My favorite items on the menu, though, are the salads.  I don't like bagged salads or bottled dressings and we never use them at home.  These salads taste like they are made fresh at home."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a new spot for lunch and I pass this place nearly every day on my way to work so I thought \"why not?\" Upon entering the restaurant I was immediately greeted by a hostess. I chose to sit at the bar since I was dinning alone. The restaurant is very clean, modern and inviting- honestly it was much nicer than what I was expecting. I love places that pay attention to detail (the ceiling had very ornate molded tiles!). Initially, I ordered the \"medium\" Italian Chopped Salad as my lunch entr√©e but the server alerted me that the portions were very huge since they were meant to be shared so instead I got the \"small\" portion for $6.95.  Let me tell you the \"small\" was more than enough for me! The salad itself was well dressed and perfectly balanced, I enjoyed every bite (I wish I had a breadstick to compliment it!). I can't wait to go back to try their pizzas and pastas.  The service was a little slow, but you can expect a quality meal."}
{"text":"I have been in USA for 13 years. I can guarantee you that this place has the BEST
pizza I have ever eaten! If you are new here. Definitely try the \"Every bit of everything\" pizza.

If you order a medium up size pizza you can have them split the pizza into two gourmet choices. 

Aside from Pizza, definitely try out the Kale salad. It's to kill for! 
Their salad portion is huge. A small salad is totally enough to split for two people as appetizer. So don't over order it! Trust me on this one!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the taste of the gluten free bread but everything else is just fabulous!"}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE PARADISE!   This place doesn't have just small a gluten free menu...it literally can substitute almost anything on the menu into G-Free.  From what I could tell the ravioli and lasagna were the only two things I couldn't accommodate.  Nice ambiance, the food was pretty good, and it was clean, which is an important factor for me.  The food came out very quickly as well, however it was lunch time and not very busy.  I will definitely be back...if not for anything then the fact that for a change I can look at an entire menu!"}
{"text":"After they changed back to Picazzos Pizza, their prices went up, the service went down and the food is not the same. So sad, as we used to love this place. Specially my son with Celiac. :("}
{"text":"Well, if you liked this place when it was Picazzo's then you'll like it now.  Pretty much everything is the same - the setting, menu (still using local, organic ingredients), gluten free options, etc.

AND they still have the Puttanesca pizza!!  (Just found out that \"Spaghetti alla puttanesca\"  literally translates to \"whore's style spaghetti\" in Italian...)

This place actually switched ownership and continued under the Picazzo's name for about 9 months before the name change to Buon Gusto.

Decent beer selection with Santan Brewing on tap, which is cool, wish they also had Four Peaks....


This next part is from my 12 YO son, who drafted it on my phone while at the restaurant.
He was pretty happy after having some cheese bread, pizza and the chocolate brownie with vanilla bean ice cream  : )

Vary Nice menu. Good service with nice waiters and waitresses.
Smells amazing and fresh. Locally sourced organic ingredients.  BEST FOOD IN TEMPE!!"}
{"text":"Great live music, great pies!

We came to support a friend who was performing that evening.  It's nice and cozy in there, but made It a pretty tight fit for the seven of us diners. The musicians were tucked in a corner, which made it a little hard to see them, but they sounded fabulous!

For apps, we ordered roasted garlic and brie with pita triangles. Half off all apps and some drinks during happy hour 4pm-7pm!  Hubby eyed Nonna's favorite gluten free crust with Queen Creek olive oil, fresh garlic, fontina, mozzarella, mushrooms, fresh organic Roma tomatoes, chevre (goat cheese), Kalamata olives, topped with fresh basil. was pretty good with a cabernet.   It was so good, my little cutie pie gave that pie a thumbs up!   The medium sized Greek salad was a good portion, hubby and I shared it.  I wasn't too crazy about the creamy dressing, it needed a little zing to it, so I asked for more balsamic.  Our server gave me more of the same dressing which didn't satisfy my taste buds.  Then I figured it was missing some citrus punch to it.  I will ask for lime or lemon next time.  

The dessert menu didn't really appeal to us.  The selection offered was more like an afterthought.  My little cutie pie settled for vanilla ice cream drizzled with choco fudge (they were out of gelato).

The service was good.  The price was good.  We will shall return."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local restaurant!! Delicious, healthy, guilt-free yet still yummy, dinner!! We love it here. Great service is a definite bonus!!

My husband and daughter are gluten-free and the GF pizza and pasta here is the best we've found in our area. The crutons, meatballs, and breadsticks are all a bonus! The \"regular\" pizza is good too.

The salads? They're wonderful!! And organic!! Huge portion too. I love the Berry one and the Chopped Italian!! Yum!

And dessert? A GF cookie baked and served warm w. ice cream? YAY!!"}
{"text":"It really is the same as Picazzo -- Really good happy hour and GREAT for the gluten free population and the people who love them..."}
{"text":"I like that the menu offers a variety of organic options. The pizza was better than most but still doesn't make it on my top 10. The service was fine but not great and I went in during a very slow time with my six year old. From where we were sitting we could see the bartender kissing a female patron, which I found very unprofessional. Overall it was neither very good nor very bad."}
{"text":"Nice weather, we gotta sit outdoors!  My friends are already here and waiting.  The server must have been looking out, she came out to greet the new people.  She took our drink orders quick.  The menu looks the same as Picazzo's.  I get my usual, 2 slice of pepperoni.  The pizza is good, thin crust, a little soggier than I would like it.  This place is a good alternative for one of my friend that has a gluten allergy."}
{"text":"Great food, not super heavy like most Italian foods,. There are plenty of healthy options as well as traditional items. Service was great, and they have a great happy hour with 1/2 price apps and low priced drinks. San Tan beers available too."}
{"text":"Remarkable pizza and salad. We visited from San Antonio, TX and my in-laws recommended Buon Gusto. All 7 of us went, 4 adults and 3 kids and the kids all said it was the best pizza they have ever had. It was very good pizza. Service was great. All fresh, organic and the right temperature."}
{"text":"Buon Gusto has been one of our \"go to\" places since before they got their new name.  I especially like the kale salad, not something you can get just anywhere.  Their pizza is great, with a wide variety of toppings.  You can't go wrong with the caramelized onion and fennel sausage.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. The garlic crust is fabulous. We also had a meatball appetizer, which had amazing sauce!"}
{"text":"check out our previous reviews under Picazzo's -- Tempe. Same basic menu, same great pizza. A few snags on the service/take out side that never got fixed during the transition, but is still one of our fave hangouts, and even nicer that I can take my gluten free friends and we each get to enjoy.

however, still take issue with the name of the puttanesca pizza. still my fave flavor, but given that puttanesca is anchovies, garlic, tomato, capers and olives, it has very little resemblance to this artichoke, feta, olive slice."}
{"text":"Best place for pizza as a dairy free, gluten free person. The one time my mother and I had an issue with service - our waitress forgot to bring buffalo sauce until after we finished eating and we couldn't find her while we were eating - we received a free dessert without asking. They are very quick with take-out too. And their happy hour is amazing!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free is what I have to be!

I used to come here when it was part of Picazzo's....it has changed a little bit but the food and service remain good.  I love their pizza crust which seems just as it was before the name change!  Best crust ever!

The Pasta is good as well.  And my niece ate eggplant, which if you knew her you would agree was a challenge to get her to do and she LOVED it!

The open faced sandwich I had was okay but really needs a top piece of gf bread but otherwise I am always happy here.  It's my gluten free go to on the south end!

Very clean building!"}
{"text":"Buon Gusto Gourmet Pizzas & Salads is what remains from the falling out with the Picazzo's chain.  The devotion to local, organic foods remains.  Frequent deals arriving in my inbox remain.  But my two favorite pizzas are dead.  I don't know if they were nixed by Picazzo's or Buon Gusto, but I loved those pizzas.  The first casualty was called something like the Chipotle Barbacoa.  It is the best pizza I have ever had.  It had barbacoa meat on top with some sort of cheese sauce that may have involved chipotles.  It was topped with jalapenos.  This pizza was actually spicy.  Not restaurant spicy, but actually spicy.  The next casualty was originally called That's Italian and then later renamed Spicy Italian.  It consisted of the combination of pepperoni and salami.  And it had this delicious tapenade with olives and carrots.  That's right, carrots.  I told my dad that the tapenade had carrots, and he didn't believe it.  He still had trouble believing it when I pointed out the carrots to him on our next visit.  May they rest in peace.  At this point, I'm just not excited by what remains on the menu.  Everything is good.  My daughter gets her usual mushroom and cheese pizza.  On our last visit, my wife confided to me that her favorite pizza was also deceased, and she is also no longer excited about Buon Gusto.  Now I know why we go less frequently."}
{"text":"What can I say . . . but this place ROCKS . . . Went for lunch with a co-worker after we decided we wanted a healthy lunch.  For being healthy . . . it sure was good.

First . . . we were greeted as soon as we walk in the door and taken to a table . . . our waitress followed shortly and took our drink order, and asked if we had any questions about the menu.

She returned with our drinks and look our order after explaining the different pizza crust.

Second . . . the salad arrived . . . I ordered the Greeek Salad and I was perfect . . . about three quarters of the way through my salad the pizza arrived . . . Nonna's Favorite . . . perfectly timed . . . first bite . . . wishing I had now ordered a larger pizza . . . it was out of this world . . . and who knew that a gluten-free crust would be so tasty.

I will definately be back . . . after all . . . I have 44 co-workers . . . and if I bring them one at a time . . . that means . . . at least 43 more trips . . . YEAH."}
{"text":"The food was great. They other different crusts for the pizzas ordered so it definitely adds a healthier kick to the meal. They also have some amazing salads. Once drinks, salads and pizzas or pastas are ordered, it is a bit pricey."}
