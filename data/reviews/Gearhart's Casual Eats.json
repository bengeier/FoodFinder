{"text":"Okay, a nice restaurant in Stallings?  With a bar?  And a patio with a tv? And cornhole? And great food at a decent price?  I didn't think it was possible but Gearhart's Casual Eats proved me wrong.  Way to go!  You will be seeing more of me."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We both got the potatoe chip encrusted pork chop, with homemade applesauce, and bacon macaroni and cheese.   The food is the most important aspect of a restaurant's offerings and they did a great job. The building is not the most beautiful, but is perfect for the price. Exactly as advertised, great service and great food."}
{"text":"We went last night as a family. The kid had a burger, they come plain for kids, just ask for the add ons if your kid likes cheese, ketchup, etc. The husband had a french dip and said it was great. I had the bacon burger - it was excellent, fresh roll, tasty toppings and meat of burger was seasoned just right. Great place if your in Stallings, NC or surround areas. Staff was happy and helpful. Well priced for the food quality. Will definitely have to eat there again."}
{"text":"Folks, if you live anywhere close to Stallings,  this recently opened restaurant is a must to try. The food is prepared by an executive chef and is very reasonably priced. For example I had a great bacon hamburger with a huge portion of sweet potato fries that was delicious. The meat is Angus and is very plentiful trust me.  All for about $7 bucks.  I stopped in on New Years Eve and had their specialty dish crap pot soup for $12.95 that contained shrimp, snow crab and lots of sausage.  Once again it was excellent!  My wife had a seafood medley and she was extremely pleased with her meal. The place is very clean including the bathrooms.  They also have a separate lounge that's done up very nice and the mixed drinks are reasonably priced as are their wines. So far I  brought 3 couples in at different times and they all were very pleased with their meal.  Currently they are doing lunch and dinner.  They're closed on Sunday and Monday as of now.    The restaurant is directly across from the Burger King and is easily overlooked because it was formerly a house and therefore does not give the appearance of a restaurant.  I am quite confident when the word gets out on this place they will do well.  Right now, it's a bit slow so you can find peace and solitude in any one of their two separate dinning rooms.  I am told their signature dish is steaks but I have not tried one as yet.   Oh yes, it's pretty much a family run operation right now with Chad doing the cooking, Wendy the business end of it, Daisy (daughter) waitress and a close friend (Taylor) also waitress. They are all so eager to please and are incredibly nice and friendly.    I hope you'll stop by and see them!  I think you'll be pleased!  The restaurant phone number is 704 234 0494"}
