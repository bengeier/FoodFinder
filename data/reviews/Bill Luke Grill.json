{"text":"While waiting for my car at the dealership, I decided to eat lunch at the Bill Luke Grill. The food was surprisingly fresh (I ordered a club sandwich), but the service made me feel like I was being barely tolerated. Additionally, someone's baby was in its carrier behind the counter, and the iced tea sat open in the brewer the whole time I waited (almost 2 hours)."}
{"text":"Bill Luke Cafe is under new management and the difference is like night and day, the service and the food have gotten better by leaps and bounds!"}
{"text":"Had a croissant breakfast sandwich after dropping off my car at the service department. The restaurant mostly caters to their employees, and the dinning room is good enough to for that - casual, and nothing fancy. It's like an oversized clean break room. The food was made quickly, and was good. Again, nothing fancy - in a styrofoam box but the volume -wow -  satisfies those mechanic guys for sure. If it were located closer to the surface street, I would and come eat here -   Like I said, their sole purpose seems to be to feed their employees reasonably.  Smart business, for sure."}
