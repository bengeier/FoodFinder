{"text":"This restaurant has a homey atmosphere and the food was soulful and fresh. Staff was friendly and the chef was down to earth and genuine.  He came out to greet the guests and was very friendly. It's located in an industrial area so might be hard to find. But it's very worth it.  They have regular customers, so when my wife and I walked in they treated us exquisitely making it certain we return."}
{"text":"This review was obviously before it closed, they are looking for a new location according to their website. soo sad I was looking forward to their food.Anyways this was reveiw, I have been here many times and I have yet to know anyone that doesn't like their food.
The flying fish special (fridays only) is really good. 2 prices fish with vegetables which are amazing and macaroni pie omg so good. I have tried the wings, fish cakes hush puppies, pasta, fish sandwich, fries. All the food tastes great. And don't forget the dessert it's different daily. My favourite is rum cake and baileys cheesecake. The only thing is that the wait is a little long. I have only been there for lunch. It's quiet during dinner as it caters mostly to businesses in the area."}
{"text":"I heard about this place while searching for good food in the area. I had never had New Orleans-style food so I was pretty excited to try it. My friend and I arrived just ten minutes before the kitchen closed, but the sign said that they would be open another 40 minutes. We tried not to feel TOO guilty as we sat down in the empty dining room. We both served time in the service industry, so we know how shitty it is when someone sits down JUST before closing time.  Despite this, our server was extremely cheery and wonderful, as was the chef, who actually stepped out to ask how the food was.

First of all, the decor is pretty loud and gaudy, but frankly I'm of the opinion that the uglier the restaurant is, and the ruder the staff are, the better the food is.. if the place has been around for years.

We started with the fish cakes which were served with a scotch bonnet aioli. They were really good, obviously hand-made because of their inconsistent consistency. Next up we had the shrimp po'boy. I've never had one of these before, and actually didn't even know what it was. Basically it was a lot of baby shrimp, in a super spiced up aioli in a crispy bun. It was pretty good, but salty. I'm not a huge fan of shrimp, so I wasn't a huge fan of this one. The fries were a little soggy, but they came with SPRAY BOTTLES of vinegar and malt vinegar! Brilliant!

What we REALLY enjoyed was the Baxter's Road Fried Chicken, which is what everyone is raving about on some other review I've read. It's a gigantic chicken breast, with a super thick and crispy breading on it that somehow manages not to be incredibly greasy. There was also a hint of honey on the breading. Now, I don't usually like chicken breast, but this was really really good. Very most and flavourful, possibly because of the little cache of spices we found embedded inside the middle of the breast. It also came with fries and a nice mixed salad with pineapples and mango dressing.

All in all, the good was great, as was the service. I will definitely go back again to order some of the other things on the menu and to take pictures! Just be aware of the times when you go, it's closed Sundays and Mondays, and closes at 6:30pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays."}
