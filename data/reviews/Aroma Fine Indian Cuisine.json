{"text":"Non-existened service!  The waiter did not even great us and did not listen to me about ordering, so my male companion had to repeat it to him! Then many people different people tossed our food on the table while passing by without any word or an eye contact! Naan bread arrived much later from the soup! Its a shame that such a dreadful worse than a fast food corner restaurant occupies area in the heart of the Toronto's entertainment district! RUN AWAY,  DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY THERE!!"}
{"text":"Undercooked food. Few choices at the buffet. Slow service. Unfriendly staff. If you are looking for a real Indian taste, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been there for the lunch buffet three times in the span of 6 months. The first time I was blown away! Food was fresh, a-plenty, and the butter chicken was delish. The second time I dragged a friend along. We were both quite impressed, going back for third helpings before we thought our buttons were about to pop. At which point my friend called the waiter and said, \"We'll have the menu please.\" The waiter's eyes popped out about 5 inches before she realized her mistake. \"The bill, I meant, the bill!\"   The third time I took a couple more friends. Maybe we were late because everything seemed to have been sitting there too long. The glorious butter chicken wasn't glorious the third visit, it was grissly and full of bones. 2 out of 3 ain't bad? Unfortunately, bones and grissle in my food is enough to turn me off forever. Unless someone else drags me along, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is $11.95 +tax! And I was very disappointed.  Indian food is my fav cuisine and this was not up to par"}
{"text":"I've tried many Indian restaurants all over the GTA, but Aroma's flavour is definitely the most superior. Tastes like heaven in your mouth. However, prices are very inflated. I've ordered 3 small dishes with a couple servings of rice which cost me almost $100 with tip! A bit outrageous, but I guess when you're this good, and you're located in a popular restaurant spot in downtown, it sort of makes sense. If they brought down their prices a bit, I'd be there regularly."}
{"text":"What a lovely meal! We were in town visiting for the week, and our hotel concierge recommended this restaurant. We did not make a reservation and were seated as soon as we walked in the door. The staff were friendly and attentive - our glasses were never empty. They answered our questions as we ordered, and our meals arrived quickly. Our food was seasoned wonderfully and just to our liking. The waiter brought the bill in a timely manner. For two of us, our bill was very reasonable (less than I was expecting). The whole meal was wonderful. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Firstly, this restaurant is on the 2nd floor of a building.  Therefore when I entered (in October), I found that the temperature was a bit warm.  My body eventually adjusted.   I went there for lunch during the week.  I walked up and entered the dining room.  I think the staff were stressed and busy, as I just stood there for ages waiting to know if I should just grab a table or wait for someone to greet me.  Nobody greeted me.    Once that matter was settled, all was well though.  I got my soda quickly, and I was at the buffet in no time flat.  The special on the buffet (a very very large heated plate) that day was Tawa Chicken, and it was awesome.  they also had all the standard Indian fare.  It was all very tasty.  I think the food was fair, and despite the awkwardness when I entered, I was served very well for the rest of the time there.  I wouldn't say the food was exceptional, but when I compare this place with the same type of food, but horribly sub-standard service, this place was great.  It was also bright and cheery.  I was grabbing lunch just before a musical at 300 King West.  so very convenient that way."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Walked in on a weekday evening to order take-out. The waiter didn't seem all that enthusiastic to take my order. Luckily, he was the exception, as the other waiters seemed friendlier.   When I first entered, I found it odd that they were on the second floor and didn't seem to have any way to get up there except a couple flights of stairs. After looking at the photos here on Yelp, I realized that they actually have more than one entrance. I included a photo of the entrance that does not seem to get used as often.   On to the grub. Ordered the Tawa Paneer Masala, the Lamb Rogan Josh, the Sada Chawal (basmati rice because it's not included), and an order of Garlic Naan. I'm no connoisseur of Indian food, but I know what I like. The Tawa Paneer Masala was sufficiently cheesy. The Lamb Rogan Josh was well seasoned with spices and hot enough to my liking. However, I didn't think the lamb was tender enough. I was disappointed that the entrees didn't already come with rice. But, what do you expect for a downtown restaurant? Finally, the Garlic Naan was excellent. Fresh and had a ton of tasty garlic.   I believe the prices are on par with other places I've been to. Would I go back again? Sure. Is it my favorite Indian place? Not so much."}
{"text":"Great place for a weekday lunch! it's served buffet style so there's no wait  for your order.   The buffet itself is quite small but there is a lot of variety. There was a lot of flavor in the butter chicken and they were pretty good at making sure the buffet was always topped up ...especially the naan bread!   Place gets pretty busy but service was still attentive and the price was right!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big proponent of Aroma and found it to be the best Indian restaurant among the three located in Entertainment district (Kama, Dhaba and Aroma).  I went to Aroma with my team as part of our Diwali Celebration lunch and i am very disappointed. Compared to before, the restaurant is revamped to make room for more people, they got rid of the big salad bar with chickpeas, lentils, quinoa, beetroots etc and replaced it with the general salad bar where they have 2-3 types of chutney and chopped cucumber and tomato.  The main dish bar had most of the items a normal Indian buffet has but the only thing worth eating was the Tawa Chicken.  ChickPea curry (Chole masala) was sweet, Matar Paneer hardly had any paneer. Buffet had no type of Dal (lentils). Butter chicken was half cooked. The dessert only had Gulab Jamun and Ice Cream in a corner of the restaurant where the line up for the buffet starts and it felt like you are in a local train in Mumbai trying to get to the dessert.  If i could go back i would trade my buffet at Aroma for a hot-dog from the vendor across my office.  I would have given the rating of 2 star if i hadn't eaten at Aroma before but the way quality of food has deteriorated in the restaurant makes me extremely sad. It seems like the restaurant only cares about making money without investing in the quality of the food.  I think because Kama has now closed, Aroma has lesser competition and don't care about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The food here is the best Indian food I have had in Toronto no joke. I had the buffet and it was so worth it. The butter chicken was my favorite.  We went for work lunch as a group of 15 and all of us had at least 3 plates each (some had 4 or 5! It was THAT good!)  I actually like that the seats were close together as it made it feel more intimate. I highly recommend the lunch buffet it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place four stars because the food is so good, but in the end I just couldn't, which is too bad.  My companion and I are new to Toronto and picked Aroma just by walking around King St. and looking at the different menus. When we finally made our decision and climbed the stairs to the restaurant we were greeted promptly and shown to one of the few empty tables. Some water, along with a basket of chapati and the menus, arrived promptly. Unfortunately, these were the only items to arrive promptly.   When the waiter finally came to our table we ordered a couple of Kingfishers and some lamb biryani, an order of saag paneer, and some garlic naan. We then waited, and waited, and waited some more. There was a large party that was finally getting its food, and serving this group seemed to involve the entire waitstaff. We ate our chapati, drink our now-warm water and beer, and after a full 45 minutes our food finally arrived. Both the main courses were absolutely delicious. The biryani was well-seasoned and had huge chunks of lamb, while the saag paneer had a silky texture and excellent flavor. The naan was hot and not too garlicky. The saag paneer came without rice even though we had ordered a side of basmati, but I wasn't willing to risk waiting for more food, so I used the naan as a sort of shovel for the saag paneer.   When we were finished eating our waiter gave us hot towels for cleaning up, and then we waited another 30 minutes for our check. By then we were well and truly ready to leave but it was very hard to get anyone's attention. All total we were there about   2 1/2 hours with only about 30 minutes dedicated to eating. The staff was definitely not lazy - they hustled like crazy, so either they have kitchen problems or a poor service system. The food was delicious, but the wait on both ends was just too long."}
{"text":"After going to the CN tower, I stumbled across this place while wandering up John St.  We had the chicken tikka masala, eggplant bharta, and garlic naan.  The chicken tikka masala was different than others that I've had. It was zestier and had more veggies. The eggplant bharta was great and the garlic naan was one of the best I've had. Service was ok....overall, the food was delicious and I'd come here again."}
{"text":"My son had us try this place. It was very good. The price was a wee bit of a bitter pill but over all the Butter chicken was nice and buttery, I'm sure it was slightly sugared... I hope i'm wrong... the Shrimp Biryani was very fragrant and the Naans were excellent as they should be at $3.00 each. The Seekh Kababs were delicious...so this smashing meal was delivered right to my door and I now find myself going from 3 stars to 4 stars because I will call this place again... Without a doubt some of the best food I have enjoyed in a while... Well Done..."}
{"text":"My bias, I am a lover of indian food and buffets! The atmosphere was friendly, the food prepared well and tasty, not too spices and the the service great. I discovered this restaurant in walking distance to my hotel while on a pleasure trip to Toronto! Great value and my companions, who are a bit picky.. described it as the best Indian food they'd tasted ;-) Stop on by!"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of friends in February and had a decent meal, aside the food taking a long time to be served, (it was a group of 20+ people, so thats understandable.) I was full that time and didn't get the chance to try the kulfi (iced-milk dessert) though, and ever since I travelling India, I've been on the search for authentic pistachio kulfi.   This time I went after a volunteer shift around the area, and being a cold winter night, I felt like a nice cup of hot chai and wanted to try the kulfi. My partner and I were seated and served poppers and we ordered chai and kulfi. They gave us a weird look. Ok... anyway, the chai reminded me of India, but could use more cinnamon and cardamom. The kulfi was actually not half bad, and had a decent amount of pistachios, but felt a bit freezer burnt. I considered ordering more food but I had already eaten earlier, so decided not to this time. When we asked to get the bill, we were unkindly told they don't serve just tea and dessert without ordering a full meal. Ha. Really? We felt extremely unwelcome and discriminated towards. Perhaps the way we were dressed? How much they thought we could pay? I don't know what business model they run under, but as far as I am concerned, business is business and should be happy for any business. Don't judge a book by its covers, I don't have to show you what I do for a living, let alone justify what I order? Well, it doesn't matter anymore!   Too bad, the food was OK and I was considering making a reservation for a group of friends this weekend, but with the bad attitude and hence extremely poor service, you have lost our business... wait for it... FOREVER. I'll be sure to spread the word with my buddies, so too bad for you!"}
{"text":"Great good, good location and friendly service.    I have eaten at this restaurant a half dozen times or more now and have never been disappointed.  In particular I would recommend their vegetable samosa's, lamb saag, butter chicken and tandoori chicken dishes!    I live downtown Toronto so have plenty of options for Indian restaurants.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"As my first yelp review I felt it appropriate to write about my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.  I've eaten here many times for both lunch and dinner and will give my takes on both.  Lunch:  Lot's of variety, quick service and delicious food.  As a regular though I can see the food quality slowly going down.  For example, they used to use only white meat in their chicken dishes but now it's mostly dark.  Needless to say the food is still the best Indian in the area, you'll leave happy and make sure you don't have a lot planned for the rest of the day because you will need a nap after.  Dinner:  This is where Aroma shines.  Don't expect to come here and get bargain Indian food, your tab will be higher than expected but trust me it's worth it. To me the experience is one of the closest to actually eating in India.  The food is flavorful with just the right amount of heat to not be overpowering.    Get the Chicken Mirch Tikka, your life will change for the better."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices, nice portions."}
{"text":"I have been to several Indian Cuisines and must admit that Aroma is consistently delivered the best. The food is alway delicious and fresh, the service is great. I have also ordered delivery from Aroma and have never been disappointed. Excellent vegetarian dishes and the best Garlic naan in town."}
{"text":"This is a white person's Indian restaurant. It caters to King and Front street crowds. The prices are decent ($12 or so for the buffet) and the food isn't offensive, but its not the remarkable experience you expect when going to an Indian restaurant. The flavors are subdued, the spiciness is at best a  suggestion not a feature, and overall the food is just...there. you eat it, you see full, and you go back to work.   If you're expecting Indian food like you're used to in Little India you will be disappointed. If you're going with a bunch of work friends to ear together and need something inoffensive and not very threatening, go here."}
{"text":"Do not go here! The manager is a complete moron. Like United Airlines, they overbooked and then randomly or deliberately deny people entry despite sending a confirmation email confirming the reservation. The manager is an overweight rude guy. I explained to him that I had my reservation yet the guy didn't even let me complete my sentences, talked over me and was rude. He kept saying, \"I called you to tell you we are overbooked as soon as you reserved the table.\" Well, he called me 30 minutes after my reservation was confirmed. It's completely unacceptable to cancel someone's reservation. That's why you make the reservation in the first place. Remember the Sienfeld episode. Btw, I think if they're overbooked they're more likely to reject you if your name does not sound Caucasian... It's the colonial mentality."}
{"text":"Food came almost an hour late. The waiters did not let us know about the status of our food either. I recommend getting the butter chicken and naan. Biriyani was not pleasing to eat."}
{"text":"A stalwart of the King St restaurant row, this place is remarkably consistent.  Super-fresh Naan, and all the dishes are tasty.  This has become my go-to lunch buffet spot."}
{"text":"Dined here in the afternoon on a weekday with some co-workers. Good food, very spacious, bright atmosphere, a little bit more expensive than your usual Indian buffet place though.  One dish that sticked out for me was a chicken dish that was served in a very large steel plate. I've never tried that before and still don't know what it was called, but it was very good. Everything else taste quite standard."}
{"text":"I hate hate HATE restaurants that will happily splurge $$$s on unnecessary fancy décor yet who insist on serving low-quality, cheap meat. Aroma epitomised this for me.  Elaborate paintings and sculptures adorn this large restaurant. Classy white tablecloths are draped on the generously sized tables and make you feel as if you are at a banquet. The staff are fancily dressed and will hand you heated hand towels after your meal so you can leave feeling thoroughly satiated and refreshed. How lovely.  A pity, then, that they serve obviously-defrosted and UNDERCOOKED chicken. I can look past the fact that the meat was previously frozen but there were too many times when I bit into the giant-sized chicken chunks in my Jalfrezi and got that gross, pinky-almost-raw taste and texture. Shudder. The chicken pieces that were cooked well were fatty and tasted old - not just previously-frozen old, just generally OLD, shrivelled and dull.  The naan bread I ordered came drenched in oil! It was unbelievably offputting to the eye.   Service was pretty bad. The exception was one of our (many?!) servers who was unbelievably sweet. The other staff were aloof and really, really slow. It took an age to get the bill.  It really is a shame, because this restaurant has good prices; almost identical to places like Little India and Babur a few blocks north in a less-upscale part of the city. Also, the sauce in my Jalfrezi was one of the nicest I've ever tried. It certainly was, as the restaurant's name implies, 'Aromatic'! But with that undercooked chicken - never again.  A typical tourist trap in one of the busiest restaurant strips in Toronto. Big letdown."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet. Buffet supposedly starts at 11.30 am but when I arrived, they were still preparing and bringing out the food. Buffet price is about $13++.   Overall, I would say meat selection is the best I've had (I've been to Little India and Bombay Palace). Fish, goat, tandoori chicken, butter chicken tikka massala and beef. A number of veggie dishes. Was a bit disappointed they did not have palak paneer (spinach with goat cheese).   My only gripe is with the dessert and fruit part of the buffet. Fruit selection was a bit lacking (honeydew, rock melon and watermelon) and they didn't refill the watermelon. The ice-cream was clumpy/hard, icy and looked old. Still tasted fine though (once you got past the unappetizing look of it).   I'd come here again, solely because of the good meat selection."}
{"text":"I am spicy kinda person so hot and spicy is my thing. Food here is awesome with nice ambiance, did not feel like curry smell when I got out but must say i had one of the tastiest Chicken Tikka must go back again."}
{"text":"This has been a fave spot of mine for over 8 years.  Servers are very good;always coming by to check on how you are enjoying your food but not rushing you. They'll make dishes more spicy if you ask. I haven't been disappointed in any food I have ordered here. Great curry;the vegetarian selection is delicious. Ambiance is comfortable with decor that reflects the Indian region the owner is from without trying too hard. Better choice than stuffy LUMA across the street and far more affordable.  Go."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant indiens, les plats étaient vraiment savoureux et parfaitement relevés. Le service était très agréable et le prix général plus que correct."}
{"text":"Great butter chicken. My wife and I split one order with rice & nam bread. Super succulent. The bread was fresh and light."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this restaurant recently while we were staying just around the corner. We were treated upon arrival to crisp, tasty poppadom with a small selection of sauces and began our meal with mixed vegetable samosas and pakoras. They arrived promptly, served on a bed of lettuce, romaine lettuce and tomato and were delicious. For our main course we ordered Beef Rogan Josh, Chicken Korma and Malai Prawns, white rice and two kinds of Naan bread. Like the appetizers, everything arrived hot and delicious.  The service was also very good. Our waiter was personable and attentive, without getting in the way. When we had finished, he had the leftovers wrapped up for us in no time. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one we'd be happy to repeat."}
{"text":"I've had take out from here quite a few times and tried a few different things and i've had mixed feelings each time.  The chicken biryani is ok. Its not the best - its lacking something just cant put my finger on it.  Chicken Tikka Masala - not a personal favourite but my family things its really great. I don't think it has the tradiitonal tikka masala spices.  Green Chicken - this was really great! The meat had great simple flavours and was so tender - cooked perfectly.  Daal Makhaani - by far, my favourite dish here!  i will keep trying other dishes as the location is close to work - i'm not a big fan yet, its a taste in progress!"}
{"text":"A really nice place to enjoy great Indian food. The waiters were super attentive and the atmosphere was nice, not as stereotypical as in other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a department lunch at work I always suggest this place. So much in fact, that people have stopped asking me where I want to go because they know I'm just going to say Aroma.  My love of Aroma began with the simple reason that my breakfast usually consists of a few cups of coffee. By the time lunch rolls around, I have little patience for sitting in a restaurant waiting for food when I'd rather be eating ANYTHING to soothe the burning caused by two (delicious) starbucks grande christmas blends (especially when food is brought out at different times and you need to sit there and stare at it until everyone is served.)  However, like many relationships of convenience my feelings towards Aroma have blossomed and now I am indeed, a fan.  For starters, Aroma has a great selection of dishes, including meat dishes (unlike certain other all you can eat Indian restaurants down the street). The food is not spicy (this is a plus in my situation, so everyone including those who don't care for the spice can enjoy) but it definitely isn't bland. I'm also a big fan of their naan, which is super greasy (never had naan like that before) but insanely good for getting at that last bit of rogan josh on your plate.  The service is fantastic too. My water glass is never empty (important when consuming mass amounts of meat) and they are great at taking plates away when you are finished.  Be warned though - eating at Aroma is a serious threat to productivity, especially on a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents for dinner on Monday. Cozy warm feel in the restaurant. We snacked on complimentary warm poppadom with a house made tarragon sauce. For our meal we shared chicken noorani kabab, chicken madras, lamb korma, paneer saag, with rice and garlic naan. Everything was fresh and homemade. The kabab was some of the most tender perfectly cooked chicken I've had. The flavours were complex and delicious. The madras was not overly spicy but had a kick. The saag had a deep flavour of balanced spices, I couldn't get enough. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. Would absolutely return."}
{"text":"ihave been there so many times .. this  has become an all time favorite for having \"lunch with a group of co-workers\"  ... affordable Indian buffet at its best ... the only down side: on Fridays the restaurant becomes very crowded"}
{"text":"Decent Indian food but a little expensive for what it is. This would be a 4/5 if the price point was right. Nice decor, low lighting. A good place for a date if you can both handle spice well."}
{"text":"I work across from there so I have been more than I admit. Cheap lunch buffet ($12ish), great food, good service.  -1 star: Even for an indian buffet, the selection is not very high. And you can forget about spices, because this place is western-certified plain. If you want spicy you'll have to use their hot sauce, which is even not spicy. Give me some real indian flavor!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The chicken pakora is fantastic and the chicken is always really juicy. Another favourite is their bread basket which comes with a delicious variety of naan breads with different toppings/flavours. All of the other plates I've tried are always very well prepared and have wonderful flavours. I've always had great experiences with the service. Once, I forgot my purse there, and the staff had put it aside for me when I came back the following day. Looking forward to dinner there again tonight!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food but admittedly I tend to get the same dishes in order to test how good the restaurant is. So I order the Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, Saffron rice and Naan bread.  The food took a little long to arrive but when it came it was nicely presented on white modern dishes.  The food overall was OK.  Flavourful but not lip-smacking savoury. Chicken dishes had white breast meat  which I like very much but the sauces were too thick and goopy.  I have had better. The service was decent.  Water glasses were always full and heated cleansing towels were provided before and after the meal.  A better lunch buffet than Friday night dinner place."}
{"text":"Nice Indian place in 2nd floor overlooking a busy street corner in the entertainment district. Not outstanding, and I think it's a little overpriced with small portions, but the goat curry is interesting and the rolled-up poppadums are quite different. Nice naan and onion kulcha. Tandoori chicken seems to be a specialty there, as several people in the restaurant had ordered that and it looked amazing, sizzling like crazy as it went by. We ordered a veg kofta which had a nice creamy sauce, but featured a sort of cheese dumpling that I didn't care for. Good saag chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! Had to come on here and say I was feeling sick and one of the servers noticed and offered me hot lemon water which was really nice and unexpected. Definitely coming back here for a full meal + dessert since I was too sick and had to take out my unfinished meal. 5 stars for the excellent service, I'm impressed by how nicely they packed up my food too with circular containers and staples and all haha. I would recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I got a recommendation from a friend living in Toronto.. Indian too.... so I took him on his word.. and yunno he was right..  it was across the street from my hotel...the service was aces.. .the food was fresh.. the environment was classy..and the room was lit dark.. warm.. nice energy..  the building had a lot of character.. it looked like something from the victorian era...19th century brick building.. second floor...  I had the assorted pokora.... and some wine... it was great..   and for dinner was chicken tikki marsala and chickien biranyi...and lentils..  all of it was amazingly good..   I was especially surprised by the lentils...    the serving dishes were wonderful too..  coming out of spending an afternoon at the royal ontario musuem.. and seeing the same serving trays...  was a nice connection....  plenty of food was served.. nice portions.. took some home with me to the hotel..  which made for great late night snack....."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian Buffet style restaurant. Simply  delicious that will not break the bank. Highly recommend this place. Not fancy bur would bring anyone here for a good time."}
{"text":"Great food, would say the best in the city after host 259 (which has pathetic service). Haven't tried the dine in option but I am sure it's great as their food."}
{"text":"I come here for the spacious dining along with some of the best fresh nan brought to your table."}
{"text":"Amazing service and good food! I was physically unable to pick up food at the restaurant, the delivery service wasn't available until about 5pm but the owner was so kind, he drove my order to me!!! The food was amazing, the owner was sooooo nice!  Thank you very much!!!!!"}
{"text":"The cup of chai need not come over 2 hours.  Too much garlic in one dish, poor presentation in another.  Where is the chef we knew.  Where is the service we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Buffet Lunch Friday Dec 30, 2016 $13.99 signature food : Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Mixed veg. Pakora, Goat Masala Dessert was Ok. only few selection."}
{"text":"The food from Aroma's is consistently excellent. I have dined in  and ordered takeaway, both on a number of occasions. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"called in 3 times for either carry out or delivery (which ever was quicker) but nobody answered. I ended up walking there and placing my order. The staff was nice and attentive. I ordered the Lamb Chop Kandhari. The price was $3 more in the restaurant than the order website and it was supposed to have 4 pieces. They quoted me 20 minutes but it took 30 minutes, normally I wouldn't care, but when I had already called in 3 times to make the whole experience more time efficient the extra 10 minutes mattered to me. When I received my order it only had 3 pieces, however the flavor was good. I'm sure the experience would've been better if I had ate there. I would give it another shot, I'll update my review if I do!"}
{"text":"I came in with a large group of people. We ordered a boat load of food for dinner. The portions were meek, the food was decent, the bill was too large. I wish we could've done the buffet. Nice ambience but not what the doctor ordered for hungry men."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night and I we got a flavourful goat dish called Sali Boti and the goat was sooo tender. My boyfriend loved the flavor of the sauce that came with it. The Dum Aloo Kashmiri dish comes with an awesome saffron sauce. By the end of our meal we were full but still craving more. Restaurant had a quiet atmosphere i ln the evening."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money! Worst Indian restaurant ever in terms of food and non existent service. Came here on a dead Tuesday night for some Indian cuisine. Me and my guest waited 45 MINUTES for our food. I cannot explain how poor the service was. There's no words to describe how the server did not care when the food took so long and no apology at all. There's definitely something wrong with the kitchen if food takes 45 minutes to reach the table. The lack of communication between the server to customer is atrocious. The customer sits there for 45 minutes staring at the server walking back and forth.   Awful experience. I wonder if they went to India to catch the chicken for their chicken tikka masala. I've never seen chicken curry taking this long at any restaurant!   Poor management and employees just don't care about their jobs. No wonder there's so many bad reviews. Should've read the reviews before coming here. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Went here for their lunch buffet and it was very good. Many different dishes to choose from and everything I tried was good. Excellent value at around $14 per person. Place was very busy, so it took a while to get our bill. Other than that highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Arrived here kind of late- very slow getting seated, and very slow taking the order (kinda ignored me for a while to the point I was ready to walk out), but once they took the order things speeded up a lot and service was decent. Food was OK- butter chicken was good, garlic naan OK, bengan bharta was marginal. Decent, but not best Indian joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a review based on my visit in December 2016. We had a company Holiday luncheon in this restaurant (each employee paid their own). This location was chosen mainly for cost.  We were a group of over 20 people. Quite big for a small space, share with other patrons.  We were near the end, until I looked up at the ceiling. Behold - a giant roach crawling on the ceiling.  I never made a mention to the group - imagine the chaos. However I emailed the restaurant about my concern. Even attached pictures I took.  Josh - responded back with apologies.  In the email, he mentioned \"come back, and I will take care of you\".  A year later, I emailed back Josh asking about how he will take care of us. The group was thinking of returning for this year's luncheon.  Josh never responded back. Radio silence.  Haven't return since."}
{"text":"A welcome surprise on the King W. strip. I usually go to Dhaba two doors down and frankly the similarity between it and Aroma is a little striking, I'm wondering if they might be owned by the same people. The decor and layout of the restaurant is very similar as is the food. Fresh, robust taste, and good quality ingredients. The \"standard\" hotness at Aroma is really mild mind you, while Dhaba is a little hotter. Next time I go I will definitely ask for hot at Aroma because the dishes probably didn't even have any chilis in them. But the rest was so promising I will definitely go back. I still think Banjara is more flavourful, but also probably fattier and heavier so Aroma will have a spot for my pre-TIFF dinners."}
{"text":"I'm am generally never a fan of Indian food but i have to say that this is the best i've been to.    I can't speak to the buffet as i only dine there off the menu for dinner.  I regularly order the Butter Chicken, Lamb Korma and the Mulligatawny and i have never been disappointed.   Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Food is good. The staff treat customers different. At times they serve naan on table and at times they don't. It's mostly crowded on weekends, so good to get a reservation if you are planning on visiting this place."}
{"text":"My go to for Indian delivery. I order online and it's convenient and had great selection.  I've enjoyed all of the dishes I've tried and love their vegetarian selection. If I HAD to remark on a negative taste, their chutney us pretty gross. I've never dined in so i can't speak to service or appearance.  I'm never upset with a bowl of a lentil dish and a slab of their garlic naan."}
{"text":"The more I remember this, the worse it gets. This is the second worst indian food I've ever had in my life (first being Maezo). We had takeout: The lamb roganjosh was very bland, and the meat did not even taste like lamb. It looked like chicken. I think they messed up our order.  The chicken masala was terrible compared to other chicken masalas I've had at other restaurants. It was overly oily, and the peppers in it tasted rancid.  The naan was wet and soggy. They didn't pack it properly to prevent the steam collecting inside the aluminum. Other restaurants are able to pack it to-go without making the naan soggy. The tandoor paneer was actually alright, it was the only acceptable part of our meal.  I later told my Indian friend about this, and he said \"oh Aroma? why on earth would you go there?\" Well, now I know..."}
{"text":"Excellent place... cheap, very convenient and really good food. Recommended! Went for buffet style lunch."}
{"text":"We had the vegetarian eggplant dish and a lamb curry. Both were tasty with a little spice kick. The bread layered with mint was also good. Only thing I didn't like we're the crispy rolls - but those are complimentary. The service was a little slow for an early dinner but staff was nice. I'd go again if I was hungry for Indian and nearby. Nothing I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Meh! For the amount of Indian population in Toronto, this place is way below the bar! Most of the meat dishes in the buffet were undercooked, maybe due to the number of people eating and they can't keep up? Whatever the case maybe, not coming back here! That's just one plate of food that I picked up and left more than half on the plate."}
{"text":"While the ambiance and servers were nice, the one thing that really mattered was severely lacking. The quality of the food was meh. The butter chicken was cold within seconds, the paneer was too spinach-y. This isn't even to mention the super small portions. $15 for a portion of butter chicken the size of your fist? $5 for TWO pieces of Naan? A handful of rice? I would not recommend this place unless you like to throw money away."}
{"text":"I found many of the dishes not to be spicy enough. It was a lunch buffet so maybe the a lar carte dishes may taste better. The spices I love when getting Indian food just weren't there."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto from the US and I was very pleased with this restaurant.  Because of the old fashion decor, at  first I was unsure of whether I would enjoy the restaurant. But the wait service was great and the food was delicious!  I had butter chicken, and my friend had Chicken Mirch Tikka tandoori. We both enjoy our meal!"}
{"text":"This is a decent Indian restaurant on the top floor of \"restaurant row\" across from the Bell Lightbox. I was a bit worried that it would be a tourist trap given its location, but it's a pretty standard Indian place.  I had the chicken vindaloo which was tasty but not very spicy. My friend's beef vindaloo was much spicier for some reason, and if I return I would get that. The nann and rice were really well done and the portion sizes were fairly generous.  The appetizers such as pakoras were well prepared and the service was attentive. In terms of atmosphere, it's nothing special but you get a pretty good view of the surrounding entertainment district out the windows."}
{"text":"Would've given 5 stars for food, it was the absolute best Indian I've had in Toronto. The standouts were the chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, and the vegetarian roasted Eggplant dish. The naan was so fresh, you could see them making the dough when you walk in, and they make it hot and fresh to order. It was heavenly. Only lost 1 star for slightly slow service. But will definitely be returning many times. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Interior is pretty and staff is fast too. Food is good! That's all we need! But I gave 4 star because they bought Starters, main course at the same time after insisting that don't bring everything at the same time because we like hot food not cold!"}
{"text":"Not bad, fine for a quick bite. We were starving and a ready-to-go lunch buffet was the answer. Food was slightly above average, nothing to write home about. . I am sure there are better places but we didnt spend time to research. isolated and quiet spot on second floor is not bad.  This place was good enough and price was fine, no complaints"}
{"text":"One star is for the service, not the food.   I have been several times, and the buffet food is pretty good.  I walked in with another guest at around 2:30PM in the afternoon, they refused to serve me buffet even though I told them what they had visible on the buffet was fine.  Their issue was that it was \"past the time\" and they would apparently rather waste the food then sell to 2 more buffet customers.  The waiters there have no problem turning customers out of the door."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this place! I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night for dinner and they seated us promptly. The service was friendly and nicely paced, the decor was nice,  the dishes were excellent (especially the paneer masala....mmmm), and the price wasn't bad (a little higher than my usual indian place, but not too pricy). Yes it could have been spicier, yes it could have had a few more beef options...   ...But it had KULFI and it was AMAZING! I first had kulfi (Indian ice cream) when I went to Dubai and fell in love with it, and was promptly disappointed by the lack of Indian restaurants in TO that offered it. My regular indian restaurant began serving it recently and I got all excited and I took one look at it and went \"huh?\", as it looked really weird and tasted weirder. That made me quite sad. But this place totally rekindled my love for it. If you like hard ice cream and pistachios - try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian food, excellent taste. The staff was very helpful explaining the selections on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service was quick and attentive, and the food was so delicious. We had the cheese naan and chicken tikka. It was very flavorful and cooked wonderfully. We enjoyed it a lot. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice as well and perfect for a cozy date!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Indian place in Toronto and I would consider myself a regular here. Their fish malabari and saffron paneer are not things I've seen at other Indian restaurants that are flavourful and delicious. They have a kitchen that looks onto the restaurant which is nice, because I've read that people who work in kitchens with a \"view\" have better workplace mental health. The tables are set nicely with tablecloths and are neat. It's a good versatile place to come with family, friends, or on a date. In the daytime or evening in the summer, some of their tables have great views. That being said, my one critique of this restaurant would be that their wait staff is pretty high-strung. They seem constantly panicked and I've never had a conversation with them that extends beyond \"ok what do you want\" and \"ummm I'll take...\". Considering how often I am there I should have build a rapport with the staff but have not."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the portions are small especially considering the price. None of the food comes with rice so ordering that on top of the already pretty expensive dishes (avg $15). This would all be bearable if it wasn't for the completely awful service. It was painfully slow and they brought out one dish at a time, so everyone had to wait to eat and the food was cold. We asked for the bill 3 times the third time the waiter laughed in our faces. Very rude. The food was fine but definitely not worth the terrible experience."}
{"text":"We went for a walk to find an authentic place. We came across a sign that simply read \"authentic Indian cuisine\" and I decided to roll the dice. We walked upstairs to a wonderful smell. We got the lunch buffet and I was wildly impressed by the taste and quality of the food. Everything is fresh and authentic. Having been to India several times, it can be hard to compare the food but this place is spot on. The mango lassi is made fresh when you order and the service is prompt. We saw a lot of Indian people with is always a great sign that authentic food is there. The atmosphere was like a nice family run restaurant and we were extremely pleased."}
{"text":"Umbrella Guy @ Aroma.  Came in for lunch on a Friday without prior reservation. We had intended to go to a different indian buffet but they were closed for renovations. It is possible that it being temporarily offline caused this place to get a lot more customers.  There's a washroom upstairs, outside of the restaurant itself. The washroom itself is pretty nice, with an excellent hand-dryer.  When we arrived, there was a line waiting at the door. Maybe three or four groups of people in front of us. We looked in to get their attention and noticed a number of empty tables, but we were informed that they have been reserved already. Well, given that Friday lunches tend to be quite busy, probably should've called in.  After 15 mins, a table cleared up and we got seated. Now, this was when we realized there was a SECOND entrance on the other side of the restaurant, and there was also a line-up there. Basically, this place has two entrances, and the staff are just walking back and forth to greet people. Weird.  The seating plan is quite cramped, and expect to weave around the room to get to your seat, especially if it's really busy there's a number of bottle necks. There are a number of tables placed really close to the food area, which isn't going to be particularly comfortable for those sitting there, and those trying to get food. Worse, for some reason, they decided to place the hot foods next to where those tables are, rather than off to the side. The salad bar's over at the side and no one really goes there.  Floors were also sticky, but I guess it's reasonable since it's busy and they don't really have time to clean up any accidents. Service staff only came around like twice during the 30 mins we were there, but again, they're really busy and there was this huge company lunch that seemed to be getting more attention.  In terms of food selection, I think there's less than the other indian buffets in the area. I did enjoy the taste and quality of the food however, so if they carry your favourite dishes, then quality over quantity right? Food re-fills don't come too fast so if it's busy, you may end up having to wait for the next batch."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've had Indian food, and we were desperate for it while we were visiting Toronto, and Aroma didn't disappoint.  The Great: Aroma delivers to the hotels near the Rogers Center. The chicken tikka masala was wonderful and spicy (not overwhelmingly). The lamb biryani was quite simply some of the best I've ever had. Finally, they didn't skimp on the garlic in the garlic naan.   The Bad: Nothing  The Ugly: Nothing."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian options for us and polite service."}
{"text":"We went for a team lunch. For a buffet they had limited options for lunch which wasn't bad because the quality was good. However I am rating this one stars because this place is to be avoided for lunch during the weekdays because it can get crowded. You have to excuse everyone at your table and around you if you want to have some new items from the buffet.  They should reduce the number of tables and maybe increase the price. It left a bad taste."}
{"text":"Indian food is goooo-oood! Nothing beats a delicious malligatwani soup, yummy naan, sensuous butter chicken and fresh mango chutney! I've been to only a few authentic Indian restaurants, and Aroma is a nice and fairly good establishment.    It is located on King Street, in the very busy entertainment district. You have to walk upstairs to get to Aroma, and once inside, will find a cozy and classy set up. The prices range from cheap to spendy, and if you are with a big group it's best to order a number of dishes as they are all big enough and rich enough for sharing.     I had a cold when I went to Aroma, so I can't comment on the smells of their food (the first thing I always notice when I step inside an Indian restaurant). However, the food was quite good. I recommend the samosas, malai prawn, and their butter chicken.   Another great thing about Aroma is their lunch buffet, daily from 11:30-3pm for only $9.99! All you can eat Indian!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from this restaurant, and are looking forward to visiting the restaurant for a sit down dinner. We had naan, chicken biryani and aloo Kashmiri. This is our new favourite Indian restaurant. We've never had aloo Kashmiri before but it is so creamy and delicious and the chicken biryani is also very good and fragrant. We were surprised that the meal didn't come with papadums and pickles like other restaurants, and we were missing cutlery from the bag. Food takes a while to prepare, but it is so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Aroma is a great name for an Indian restaurant. It's in a great location too. It's located in a touristy area so it can get busy. We went on a Tuesday and it was half full.  We had a chicken curry and a beef curry. I can't recall the names. The food is good but not the best I've had for Indian. I found the beef pieces too hard. It would have been better if the beef chunks were more tender. Maybe should have used different cuts of beef? Chicken was better. The sauces they use are amazing. Very aromatic.  The decor is superb in this restaurant. It makes for a nice date spot or business lunch/dinner.   For a restaurant in a touristy area, the prices are not too terrible. Expect to pay $14 +per dish. Rice not included.   If you're in the area and feel like Indian, this is not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Had good reveiws so we tried it and irdered take out and waited for it. One waiter we talked to was really rude. It was really expensive and médiocre. The naan is very doughy and the butter chicken was too tomatoe Based and not rich like usual. There are much much better restaurants for this price."}
{"text":"This was ok, had very conservative Indian food, high prices, nothing too memorable.  I heard lunch was better, so I wll try it, consider this a mini-review until the lunch rush...."}
{"text":"New favourite spot for Indian food in Toronto! I've been here twice and the quality has always blown me away. The curries are so fantastic.   I usually stick to the Paneer Masala but the Saag Paneer is wonderful here too. The garlic naan was super delicious as well.   Naturally, there are tons of vegetarian options so a great place for veggies!   If I could eat here every night I probably would! Come hungry because one curry per person is a ton of food with rice and naan.   I love taking Indian food home, though, and this place is great for leftovers as well!   I haven't had dessert here but I promise to update this review when I do. I'm sure the Gulab Jamun is great!"}
{"text":"Met couple of my freinds who were from out of country on a convention nearby and took them to a lunch buffet on a week day. The food was nothing to talk about - not flavourful at all. Had to ask for naan as they were late in filling it up. As the freinds had to leave after lunch to attend some of the seminars ate quickly, paid my bill and left. Later find out that they charged a 15% surcharge ! I then remembered then when I paid my bill on a credit card all I ahd to was enter my pin. Usually establishments show us the amount and then ask whether you want to enter the tip as % or $. I asked the waiter, why and he said he did not know. I cash tipped him and left.   I later called the waiter and and the manager to complain. I felt cheated. Please be careful. Wonder what the the waiter thought - that we were all from out of town and were not aware of the local customs?"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the city core.  Excellent service.  The food is not too spicy. It can be if you want it to be. Get the almond cream dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Indian restaurants in downtown Toronto.  Food is consistently good and service is great and servers are very attentive. Their samosa is big and filled with lots of goodies. Garlic naan is a must for garlic lovers. Their Biryani is terrific- they put raisins and dried apricots which adds a bit of sweet ness to the dish. Tandoori chicken is tender and juicy and it's marinated perfectly. Other favourites are lamb saag, lamb Sali boti and butter chicken. Their mango lassi is yummy. The owner is there to greet patrons on the weekends and he's really nice."}
{"text":"In my top 3 favourite Indian restaurants in Toronto.  Great lunch buffet - dinner time is a la carte.   I love their lamb and tikka masala. Extremely authentic. The spices are rich. The colours of the food are deep. The smells are strong.  I love going for the lunch buffet but it is a lot of food. Dinner is a great casual place for girlfriends just to share a wonderful meal and chat. Service staff are friendly but not always as attentive.  Don't take it personally.  Oh, and always get the aloo ghobi. Cauliflower and potatoes. Heaven started with this dish...  Clean off your plate in solidarity!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is near my apartment and I often come here when I miss home cooked indian food. So far I've had the goat curry which was delicious, saag paneer which was good too, and butter chicken which was ok (the chicken was a bit tough). I think this is one of the better Indian food places in downtown and would come here again."}
{"text":"Compared to KAMA, I felt the food here was better.  It came hot and tasted better.  My favorites were Paneer Masala, Chicken Tikka and Butter Chicken.  Like all Indian buffets, it's extremely heavy.  I barely finished 2 plates.  We went 11:45am and the food was nice and hot.  The place was more crowded than KAMA.  It was a bit too crowded for me as I had trouble getting in and out of my table.  The price was quite steep for Indian food.  My bill came to $17 including 16% tip for a large party of ~15.  Overall rating is 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible...undone chicken..hair on napkin...tried to sit me in dark table because I was alone..argued with me when I said I wanted to sit somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bad food and questionable service. They're fooling ppl in the name of indian food. This isn't authentic Indian food.. Poor quality meat.. We all are feeling sick after eating here. WON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE"}
{"text":"Great buffet! Options are lacking however, but all the dishes are of very top quality."}
{"text":"I have a friend who's from Windsor where he doesn't get to try a lot of indian food and so I got him to visit T.O and brought him here.  Previously had not tried out this place before so I am really glad that things worked out and he enjoyed the food, as did my 2 other buddies who also were there.  Place is interestingly situated above a second cup or something. Decent décor. When we arrived, (around 1 on a Sunday) it was basically empty but they really filled out in an hour or so.  They are light on snacks (weak salad bar + pakoras and aloo tikki, which was dry), but the tandoori chicken somewhat makes up for it - well cooked, and spiced. Solid collection of meat curries: butter chicken, chicken tikka masala (on the tawa nonetheless; their best dish today), fish curry (gravy was too watery), lamb roghan josh (lamb was cooked too much, it was chewy, but curry was flavorful) and beef roghan josh (didn't try).  Good selection on veggie options too - aloo gobi, eggplant, paneer mutter masala and daal makhani, all of which looked good.  Naan were good, nice and fresh.  Dessert was gulab jamun - single option, but one of the better ones I have had at an indian buffet.  A pretty good experience, on the whole."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold night after going to the Bell Lightbox.  We were quickly welcomed and offered a choice of seats.  The staff were friendly, helpful and not overbearing.  The decor is quite pleasing, not loud and no Bollywood tunes playing.  Great menu selection, the usual chicken dishes plus goat, lamb and lots of vegetarian options.  Everything was delicious and leftovers were wrapped up for us. I enjoyed a chicken and spinach dish with lovely spices, so much flavour.  Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, with excellent level of appropriate spiciness. Tandoori chicken was excellent. We shared other dishes, all very good."}
{"text":"Service was okay but food was outstanding.  Definitely order the Naan with mango chutney before butter chicken."}
{"text":"I came here for a very late lunch with my boyfriend after checking out the Hot & Spicy festival over at Harbourfront Centre. Being at the Hot & Spicy festival really put us in the mood for Indian cuisine. We originally wanted to come to this place because of the their buffet lunch. But by the time we got to the restaurant we had missed the buffet lunch time and they were doing their dinner service. We ordered two dishes, a side order of rice and two side orders of their rotis. I have to say, their rotis were very good. I probably can just eat that we my meal without rice. The food I thought was very good and flavorful. The menu prices, I thought, were average. However, the service, in my opinion, was okay. But, I believe it was due to not having enough servers because the servers were all very busy. But, the servers were still very friendly and professional. I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for lunch during the week. It is usually crowded during lunch so better to make a reservation beforehand, especially on Fridays.   It's definitely great value for buffet - $12.95 for lunch. There are lots of variety (chicken, beef, goat, fish) for the price. The goat was delicious and the naan is hot and fresh. There is also a small salad/chutney bar area and ice cream.   Service is mediocre, staff is a bit hasty as there are a lot of people in the times I went. All in all, good food for a good price."}
{"text":"This is too long of a wait.. but the food is extremely good. It is good for kids, groups, couples, and more. I only rated this 4 stars because of the long wait."}
{"text":"6/5 for service! This is not our first time here, but tonight's service was exceptionally great. Every staff member we encountered was caring, professional, and thorough. I do not consume dairy at all anymore and mentioned my food intolerance tonight. The servers and kitchen staff all took it very seriously, going as far as to note it on paper, omit dairy products from products that normally have dairy (i.e. roti, eggplant bharta), and warning me before every course which dishes do still contain dairy since my partner still enjoys it. Our water glasses were constantly refilled and despite how busy it was here tonight the servers never forgot about us. Only downside was that food was a bit slow to arrive at our table, but it has been a busy night.  Very vegetarian friendly, but vegans do make sure you tell the staff in advance of your dietary restrictions because as I learned tonight that even vegan sounding dishes like eggplant bharta, dal makhani, and vegetable samosas contain animal products/dairy. In the case of breads and veggie dishes, modifications can be made to exclude dairy, but in the case of vegetable samosas they cannot as the samosas actually come frozen and they reheat it - we don't recommend ordering the samosas here as only 2 comes per order and there's not much filling.  Complimentary papadum to start along with 2 sauces, but additional sauces like mango chutney must be ordered individually. Carbs such as naan and rice are also not complimentary, so you must order these additionally. If you're looking for a healthier alternative to naan, which tends to be white flour and buttery, I recommend ordering the roti ($2.25), which is whole wheat, resembles a naan, and can come with or without butter. The vegetarian mains are quite small and at least $10.95, so I do recommend ordering a few different mains and sharing. I liked the eggplant bharta, which was moderately spicy, enough to induce that tingly sensation.   The food highlight tonight was actually the vegan Bhel Chaupati appetizer ($5.95), which is quite a large portion though not that filling since the grains are puffed, not dense. It's basically chaat - well seasoned semi-sweet and -savory and has an interesting texture that's crunchy yet a bit chewy too.  No outdoor seating. Venue gets a bit noisy due to all the families and young children here, but nothing too loud like the bars across the street. We did notice that most of the clientele appear to be Indian, so that can only be a good sign :)  Cheaper, but not as classy as 259 Host nearby, but arguably one of the better downtown Indian restaurants. Great for groups and families, maybe not so much for first dates. Will return!"}
{"text":"I had lunch buffet today along with a group of 15 from work. The food selection was decent where you could at least try the most popular or familiar ones. Tandoori chicken was the best I've tried. Very flavourful and juicy. Others like mutton, paneer, were at par with other buffet places nearby like Kama. Food is spicier that Kama but only mild so need not worry. Naan is very good too. Service was a bit slower in terms of taking our used plates but I don't mind taking them near to their kitchen. Perhaps selection would be quite limited for vegetarians. Below $20 so pretty good. Mango lassi drink highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good buffet.  A little expensive but can't beat the location."}
{"text":"DO NOT TRY TO BUY A GIFT CERTIFICATE HERE.  My parents love this restaurant. So for their 28th wedding anniversary, I called to ask if Aroma issues gift certificates. The person I spoke to on the phone said \"yes, we do all the time\" and told me to \"come in anytime tomorrow\" to buy one.  I show up the next day. They tell me they can't access the gift certificates because they are locked in the owner's office and he isn't in. They, however, call the owner and then tell me that if I pay the $75 I want to put on the certificate, they will deliver it to my house the next day.   It's now three days later and nothing has been delivered. I had to email them and also call them (and by the way, when I called, I was told \"yes I spoke to the owner yesterday and told him you wanted a gift certificate\"). Uh, you did that THREE days ago. Why did you have to tell him again yesterday?  I am now without an anniversary present for my parents, all due to Aroma's shoddy service and misrepresentations. Food might be good but don't expect any service whatsoever - and don't try to buy a gift certificate here unless you want them to take your money and give you nothing in return."}
{"text":"Eat here practically every time we visit Toronto; excellent service, food & experience at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Great Indian cuisine. Although the place is quite compact, the service is great. Their chaat is surprisingly awesome and is quite near to the one you find on the streets of Bombay (obviously the original one wins)."}
{"text":"Pathetic service.  Good food.  Don't expect to be served in 45 mins.  Most of visitors are here for hours."}
{"text":"I walked in and was seated. From there I waited a few minutes for the waiter (they were not busy). The waiters seem to congregate in a corner talking and laughing with little regard to waiting on customers.  I had the lunch buffet. I had to ask for the naan since they were out at the buffet. Again, a long wait and not even a customary mention that it is available. Not once did a waiter ask how my food was, whether I wanted more water, or whether I wanted a refill on my soda - and plenty of them walked past my table. This is definitely not a fine dining restaurant.  The buffet had a good variety of food and it wasn't bad which has afforded the restaurant two stars from me.  When paying my bill I expected the cashier to ask how things were. It would have been a great time to offer my experience, but sadly he didn't ask and hence my unleashing as a public review."}
{"text":"Very discriminating gluten free vegan here who has eaten Indian food in India and throughout the world.  I ordered via Just Eat. The food arrived hot, 10 minutes early.  After the disappointing Hakka Wow (who put wheat in pakoras) these guys did great. Not only were there 10 Pakoras for 5.99 (instead of 5 for 10.99, common in Indian joints), but they were GF and vegan - and came with a great coriander chutney. The bharta was special because I could taste that the eggplant was truly charcoal grilled. The dal had fresh tomato and was nicely spiced. I would have added fresh coriander, but thats ok. Aloo Gobi was also well done. You have to ask for dairy free bharta or they'll put butter in it.   I wish there was a fresh salad, an option to buy a side of cut onions or other fresh veg, but I'm very pleased with what I received. I'd also get an air fryer so pakoras could be cooked without deep-frying (if that'd even work).  I've gone through 7 Indian restaurants on Just Eat in the downtown core and this one's at the top. It isn't Madhur Jaffrey's cooking (regrettably, nowhere is), but it's perfectly fine with GF vegan options. I'd order again. The food I received was one notch above similar options at Bindia, Sher e Punjab,  Bombay Palace, and on par with Bombay Street food. It was several orders of magnitude better than Truly India where you could not pay me to eat. It was a lot better than Little India Restaurant.  The next day, I left the bharta as-is. I added grated ginger, garlic, coriander seed, red onion, tomato, spinach and cilantro to the dal; fenugreek and cumin to the Aloo Gobi and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"OK food, but I thought it was overpriced - rice is not included in the price of curries, but perhaps that's the way Indian food is done in Toronto?  I had khums matar paneer and it was the first time I ever had mushrooms in Indian food. The dish was flavorful and a decent-sized portion; no complaints, I'd definitely order it again. My companions had chicken tikka masala and lamb korma, and enjoyed both. However, the food took very long to prepare. We waited over 30 min and the restaurant was quite empty at the time. Maybe this is why the food was so good and fresh, but in general I thought it took too long."}
{"text":"It is quite OK if you are looking for relatively non-expensive Indian food. I like other Indian restaurants in the area better than Aroma.   Positives: The buffet menu is reasonably priced. The location is excellent, in the \"restaurant row\" on King St W., close to theatres and concert venues.  They have a food assortment of vegetarian and non-vegeratian dishes, some of them are quite good.   Negatives: The space is crammed with tables, no space to move, no space to walk; there is only one foot or so between the buffet and the first row of tables. I was not seated at one of the tables next to the buffet, otherwise my review would have been 2 stars...  The food is not the best, lamb is mostly bones, cheese (paneer) not creamy, naan not fresh, too much mayo in the coleslaw salad. The staff not very friendly (or too busy), they don't refill dishes half an hour before the buffet closes (even if they take new guests). Nobody asked me if I want something from the bar.  Only few options for cold starters and deserts. (I am comparing with Kama, which is not far away). The restaurant looks like a foodcourt, a big room with lots of light and square tables. Not much Indian decor, no booths, no soft chairs.  It is quite hard to find parking. If you find it will cost you at least $4/hour.  I will probably try the dinner menu one day and update my review."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and the place was quite busy. We were seated by the window tucked in the corner. The restaurant itself was nice looking but the table arrangements were a little strange.   The service was awfully slow and not as friendly as I would prefer. It took over 2 hours for the appetizer and food to be delivered to our table. We were often ignored and were told the food would be right up, and then we waited and waited some more.   we ordered: Appetizer platter- Onion bhajia, Vegetable pakora, chicken pakora and a samosa. Nothing impressed me at all. The samosa was horrible and one of the worst ones i have ever tasted.  Tandoori chicken- this was nicely done, good taste and nice presentation Butter chicken- I liked the sauce but the chicken tasted strange. The meat was tough Garlic naan- very garlicy! still tasty though Roti- nicely done, hot and fresh Rice- well done   The owner came over and spoke with us as well for about 15 minutes. I must say i really enjoy when the owner makes his rounds and talks to the guests. He was a really nice guy and was open and honest about his restaurant. I really enjoyed speaking with him and thought his customer service skills were excellent. I wasn't sure if i would ever come back here again but after speaking with the owner I might give it one more chance."}
{"text":"I always find myself here when I'm in town. This hidden gem has one of the most affordable and delicious Indian buffets in town. I love that it's not too far from Rogers stadium and I always leave here satisfied."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food; service was fantastic, quick, and food was Deliciously satisfying; lots of spices and chilies if you like your it hot and spicy. My hubby, son and I ordered the naan bread, vegetarian samosa, shrimp vindaloo, butter chicken and basmati rice. Lots of food left over..... portions were good (not too small nor big)."}
{"text":"Very flavorful butter chicken curry and the chicken itself was very tender. The garlic naan was good as well."}
{"text":"Decent and affordable Indian buffet if you happen to be in the area and want to grab a relatively quick meal. They had multiple vegetarian options on the buffet, which was nice to see. Only downside was that we were there when they were completely full, making the place quite cramped when attempting to get to and from the buffet to our table."}
{"text":"I keep coming back, and bringing new friends along!  Today I had the buffet, and everything was so fresh (we got there about 11:45am)!  Each dish was distinctly spiced and delicate.  All the dishes had depth of flavour not found at most other Indian restaurants.  Normally I order off the menu when I go in the evening but today's Brunch was awesome.  Service (drinks) is a little slow -- you need to wave staff down, but the food is just great!  Lots of options, and even the salad-bar is extra-tasty.  I eat a lot of Indian and this place is always great!"}
{"text":"Great service. Yummy garlic naan. Sat by the window while having my butter chicken dinner with nice warm lighting and white table cloth draped tables. Could it get any better at this price and location? I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"So this place looks really nice from outside and even has their menu placed outside so you can check it out before ordering. Honestly, basic India food if that's what you are looking for. Besides the two flights of stairs that you must climb to get to the restaurant, the wait will also make you tired and even more hungry. Do not come here if you are looking for fast service with fast food. DO NOT. So we are seated and don't get me wrong, the place is cute. One thing I appreciated was the height of the tables, perfect height to dive right in. Before I continue please be aware that there are five waiters here including the manager or owner or whatever he is. More than enough people to get this place satisfied but hmm I waited 20 min after I was done to place my order, 45 min for the food (which I will explain further) and then 10 min for a refill on the naan. WHAT INDIAN PLACE DOES NOT HAVE NAAN READY TO GO. But rewind. After I placed my order I asked the waiter to repeat everything and he mumbled the whole thing back. Real reassuring.  Ok so food. Basic butter chicken was ketchup-ey and sugary. But me being a vegetarian enthusiast, I went for a interesting vegetarian curry but to be honest I have no idea if that's the curry I ended up eating because the waiter didn't name any of the food. HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW WHAT DAL MAKHANI SHOULD LOOK LIKE. Anyway. Food. Tiny portions. No rice with curry! And trust me, I've been to so many Indian restaurants and for a 12 dollar pint size bowl of curry, rice should be provided. But I must admit, the naan was splendid.   I also must say that we did not get one refill on the water even when our cups were noticeably empty. Another thing I noticed was how some tables got papadam during the wait and my table basically got nothing.   Worst part, surcharge is included."}
{"text":"Good restaurant and reasonably priced. The lentil chicken soup was EXCELLENT. We also had okra, tandoori chicken, red curry chicken, and aloo gobi. All delish-- I will return on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"i was there yesterday with a few friends and likewise i saw a similar review, we were in a group and few of us had already eaten dinner as it was a friends birthday and unfortunately we chose this place out of a lot of indian places.   so we decided only to have dessert and yes!! the waiter who has no manners what a customer needs, said. we don't serve desserts only ! excuse me!! is there a rule book you cant jump to desserts! plus u are not even a category of fine dining! so if u don't want business just shut the damn place down.. if u are doing a lunch buffet of 12$  in the afternoon u are surely not fine dining !!  horrible service!! being an indian i would say food is ok, but am I running out of choices... will never go there again !!"}
{"text":"With a lunch buffet that has a pretty solid selection of options and a decent dine-in experience, Aroma is a good choice while you're downtown. Sure, you'll find better options elsewhere in the city, but if you're seeing a movie or happen to be downtown around lunch time and you're craving some butter chicken, rogan joshi, or saag paneer, you could do much worse than Aroma.  If I have any one complaint, it's that the seating is a bit tight; given how popular it tends to be, they would do well to lose the traditional, over-the-top, 1940s style \"fine dining\" veneer, get some better tables, and modern up the space."}
{"text":"my dad and i have been having lunch frequently in the entertainment district near where he works, and this has probably been my favourite spot so far.  the perks of buffet food when you're on a lunch break is pretty tremendous, and 11 bucks a person is probably the cheapest lunch we've found so far. the service was not amazing, and i don't think we were asked if we wanted anything to drink other than water.   the food was solid, and i though that there was a nice variety of meat and vegetarian options. i will definitely be heading back again one day."}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian food, I definitely eat with my eyes first because I like everything, I don't know the names of the dishes, and I can't just choose one dish so I also prefer buffets.  I was actually on my way to explore another restaurant when I came upon Aroma and decided to try it. As I walked up the stairs, the smell of the food opened my appetite and I was anxious to dig in.  Their lunch buffet (13.99) wasn't very big but they had most of the popular dishes. The butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, beef rogan josh, curry goat, they were all good. As tasty as it was, I could only manage to have two plates before I was stuffed. Good food.  My big disappointment, however, was dessert. Their ice cream freezer was only half full, with four tubs, and they were all practically empty. I didn't see any fruits either so I skipped dessert.  Other than the lack of desserts, it wasn't a bad overall experience. Good food, good service."}
{"text":"Like all Indian food downtown, it's slightly overpriced.  But they happen to do very good cream based curries.  Perhaps in the top 3 I've had anywhere in the world.  If you like cream based curries, try this place (butter chicken, the mcdonald's burger for 'westerners'  of curries, in particular)  Personally, I think better butter chicken than a lot of the restaurants in Little India (in Toronto) even (the restaurants Regency, Gautama for example).  The korma is good too.  Not healthy stuff, but delicious.  If you get naan bread, you're better to get the garlic naan for a little more, because their much less likely to make a crappy naan (The regular naan bread they do is hit and miss on being very dry or over burnt).  The garlic naan is a little extra, but you know garlic is very good for your body ..."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch many times this year. They are surrounded by over 2 other Indian buffets and Aroma doesn't let you down. Decent varieties, good flavour and good service. What else do you need. And yes, I will be returning in the new year."}
{"text":"I have been to Armona on several occasions for the buffet lunch and the ala carte dinner.       The lunch buffet has quite a large selection and almost all the dishes are really good. I generally love the chicken and lamb dishes at the buffet. The only dish I didnt like as much is the seafood, it seemed like the flavors of the gravy overpower the seafood taste. But thats probably nitpicking based on how good the rest of the food really is. The service is good, every time i came back to the table , the water was refilled and the old plates were gone. The gulab jamun was really well prepared.      The same quality and service continues for the dinner service. All their dishes I have ordered so far are done well. The service is excellent for the dinner service. I am especially a big fan of the lamb dishes as they seem to have figure out how to make it really tender and flavorful. Lamb Saag and Lamb biryani come to mind. They also have a rather large tandoori selection with a real tandoor (indian oven) that can be seen by the guests through a glass window into the kitchen."}
{"text":"It was a very good experience eating lunch here. The options of meat are as what you'd expect, so nothing that will really amaze you in terms of spectacular flavour.     Since it is an AYCE I must compare it to the flagship of all AYCE restaurants - Mandarin Buffet. The choices in this case lack quantity but the quality is still acceptable.     The price for admission is not too bad. The decor and service is alright.     Overall, I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great value for your money!!!! $11 for lunch buffet and there were tons of options. I really enjoyed the butter chicken and veggie options."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've had in years. They made me the goat vindaloo without any butter/yogurt, and it's gluten-free. The restaurant is intimate and quiet -- a good place for a date or a family dinner."}
{"text":"I dined here last Saturday for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised.  The food off the menu was delicious (the restaurant also offers a buffet but you have to be out of your mind to eat Indian buffet style).  Butter chicken and the vegetable pakora's were delicious.   Saag could have been better.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"We missed the buffet by 5minutes . The  waiter was a little rude , took his time on taking our order. There was only three other people in the restaurant. He definitely was not busy. Other than that the food was good just not spicy. We had 4 courses all were good flavor and not over cooked. The only thing was the food was not spicy, we asked if our food can be made spicy, it was done with no problems.Dessert"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here last evening! We were going to the symphony and they served us our delicious meals quickly.  After the show we returned to order some take out, and enjoy a relaxing glass of wine, and our server from dinner Subod (sorry about the spelling) recognized us, and treated us like royalty! We're definitely going back, for fine food and service! Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, there's nothing fine about this cuisine or dining.   My friend and I came here for dinner and the place was fairly full save around 3-4 tables that were empty. We were told they were reserved for the time we came in yet nobody arrived and in fact, another couple walked in, asked for a table and got one of the reserved ones! I don't mind restaurants reserving seats when they're at capacity, but I do mind when they discriminate against their patrons based on their age or colour (we were not white and students)  Moving on to the food, we ordered the Seekh kebab and lamb roganjosh. The Seekh kebab was charred and too hot (temperature) to eat while the lamb wasn't even cooked well, and was hard to chew.  On top of this, our meal took well over 45 minutes to arrive, while another couple who also ordered from the grill got their meal before ours albeit being seated after.   The servers weren't friendly and was rude when asked about our meal.  There's much better Indian restaurants in the vicinity to go eat at. Don't waste your time here.  PS The papad as well for apps was super oily. Don't believe me? Check the picture.  The 2 stars are for the naan."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but there are few things that I would change. I hope they will improve in future. Pros: - The price for lunch buffet is good - $12.95 - $13.95; - All dishes were hot, no complaint about cold food; - Many different options, including delicious vegetarian dishes. My favorite dishes were Butter Chicken, Matar Paneer (green peas) and Chana Masala (chickpeas); - I also liked Raita and Naan (even though naan was not that fresh); - None of the dishes were too spicy. Most dishes are mild spicy. Cons: - They do not refill the dishes!!! The buffet was closing at 3pm and we arrived before 2pm but some dishes were almost empty and they did not refill it. Some items were already gone, rice was very little left and crunchy, Butter Chicken was almost empty. I prefer when the dishes are refilled and you can come and eat anytime, even just 15 min before closing. They did refill rice after a very long time (when we were leaving), but I had to ask them to refill Butter Chicken. - The dishes were hot but the naan was not. I think they cook it beforehand and serve it later; - There is no parking around, it was really hard to find a parking spot on the busy street; - The seating design is bad. Small area with too many tables in the middle, and right next to the buffet dishes. It was hard to get to the food on one side, because I was afraid to disturb customers sitting at the tables. It is also pretty hard to walk between tables when it's full, I was hoping not to throw my food on anyone's head while passing through. - No one came to us to ask if we would like to order any drink. It was a first for me. I know there was a bar and I could go and ask myself but the waiter should ask right at the beginning; - Dessert options were very limited. Fruit bowl was already empty, I am not a fan of rice pudding, Gulab Jamun was ok, but the ice cream containers were empty-ish, too; - The restaurant has two entrances and is located on the second floor. The restrooms are even higher on the third floor. I did not see an elevator for disabled person, maybe I missed it...? Overall, the food was good, and I would come back again. This is good place for lunch, with your friends and family, but is not a place to take someone you want to impress. Great for downtown area, but there are better Indian restaurants around."}
{"text":"Buffet lunch is good, not as varied as Host Indian Cuisine in Richmond Hill, but it is more affordable, and close by."}
{"text":"This place has a great lunch buffet. It doesn't have a huge variety, but what they do put out they do well. The butter chicken and pakoras are fantastic, and really sometimes that is all you need. They also have a selection of salads you can use to cut through all that grease and creamy food. The gulab jamun (what my friends and I lovingly refer to as soggy timbits) are a great way to finish a meal.   My co-workers and I used to come here for all our farewell parties... and then the sushi craze kicked in. Good place for a group lunch, which can be hard to find."}
{"text":"Save your money and avoid this place! First of all, their biryani is very dry! Tasted like it was left out for days! Their lamb curry had NO flavour and meat chunks were chewy as though they had been taken out of the freezer and thrown into old sauce! I suspected that the quality would be shitty since I was served in 10 minutes.   This place is NOT authentic! Regrettable experience."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp.  I'm writing it so that no one else ever has to experience a lunch like the one I had today at Aroma.  This was possibly the worst Indian buffet I've ever been to.  We went for lunch on a Monday at 1:30 pm, so not an unusual lunch time.  Everything on the buffet looked like it had been sitting there for a *long* time.  We probably should have walked out as soon as we saw the steam table, but we were hungry and on a time limit, so we stayed.  The tray of dal had solidified into a lentil crust.  The rice was tough, chewy and crunchy.  There was hardly any chicken in the tray of butter chicken - I had to dig through the sauce to find just 3 pieces of chicken.  The other dishes also looked like they had been sitting there for hours.  As for the taste - pakoras were actually pretty good.  Butter chicken tasted overwhelmingly of ketchup.  Mattar paneer had no flavour at all.  Beef rogan josh was similarly unremarkable.  They bring the nan out from the kitchen rather than having it out on the steam table, so I had hoped that it would at least be fresh.  Alas, no. It also tasted like it had been sitting out being kept warm.  (Though it wasn't too bad - not like the ancient rice. The nan was probably the best part of the meal.)  We sat and waited for a while to see if they would replace some of the old dishes on the table.  Not one was changed while we were there.  I honestly don't know what they were thinking serving that food to people.  I don't know what I was thinking to eat it.    On the plus side, our waiter was friendly and efficient.  Our water was refilled when asked, and we were seated quickly and with a smile."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and the food was pretty good.  I asked for the waiter's recommendation and he recommended a particular fish dish or a chicken one.  I chose the fish...he brought the chicken (though he gave me 10% to compensate) The service was a bit slow (e.g. waited a few minutes to order after I was obviously ready, never had my water filled, waited several more minutes to get my bill, etc.).  Overall it was a pretty normal indian restaurant experience.  It tasted good, but the presentation nor the flavor were better than other places and the prices a bit higher (probably because the decor is a bit on the fancy side).  I'd go again if I wanted Indian food and I was in the area, but I won't go out of my way to recommend the place to anybody."}
{"text":"I heard about this place a while ago, and only recently went here with a colleague for their buffet and boy was I surprised. From what I understand, It has been remodeled recently and it's a little posh for my liking.   I definitely felt under dressed with my baggy jeans and a t-shirt, but given that I'm of indian ancestry so I guess it didn't matter too much. I honestly don't know if they have a dress code but it is definitely possible given that I was the odd one out.  The food itself was great, very flavourful with only a hint of chili. I did manage to sample a sizable chunk of their menu all of which were seasoned well and great. The only problem was that they had run out of naan, which is somewhat of a cardinal sin for an indian restaurant. I had completed my meal by the time more naan was available. Aside from that I had a really good time, but bring some friends as it is a very social environment.  Recommendations: Chole Palau Onion Pakora Mango Kulfi Cauliflower Bhaji"}
{"text":"DINNER REVIEW:  We ate here for our American Thanksgiving dinner and let me just say I'll stuff my face with Indian food over Turkey and Stuffing any day!  It was delicious.  We loved our meal and the owner was super nice!   We had samosas and the chat papri to start, followed by the Chicken Tikka Misalla for me and Lamb Korma for my hubby.  Portions are huge and one order of naan is plenty to feed two people, our eyes were bigger than our tummies and we had way to much food . Everything we ordered had amazing flavor and the restaurant was pretty busy.  I found that to be a good sign and many Indian diners lead me to believe that this place is legit.    The one thing they could improve is the pace of service. It was friendly enough, but I don't think I would recommend eating here before a show unless you order at least 2 hours before curtain time.  We were there for a over an hour and a half.  Yes, it was busy but the restaurant was not full to capacity.  We would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"awesome ayce indian food, their butter chicken is probably the best I've ever had (and I try it everywhere, it's one of my favs) and their naan is amazing as well.   all of their meats are tender (which is sometimes difficult to encounter for ayce places) but they do it!   it's a little pricy though so make sure you can fill your tummy full of their delicious stuff to get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Very Average. Went in expecting something different/ special, especially with a lot of the other positive reviews on this website. But that wasn't the case. I had the butter chicken, and it was just as good as most places I go to. Again, wasn't terrible, but very mediocre for a restaurant that is on the more expensive end of things. Service was also poor. Mixed up orders, and brought the entrees on first and then the Naans about 5+ minutes after, which is never good.  Would think of other restaurants to go to first before going back to Aroma."}
{"text":"we have been to this restaurant they serve the low quality food and they have disgrace. initially server has stopped us and said they snt serve Naan's and tandoori as chef is busy u must adjust with whateva der bt we travelled there for eating in that place. once we started eating for lunch we have seen that they r preparing naan's again and again it means dey want to get rid of us y ds disgrace to people who go there in a batch to eat out. if u want to go out der for a buffet dont prefer them their attitude towards service is poor."}
{"text":"I came here because, as usual, there was an hour long take out line at Khao San Road. Needless to say, my spirits were low and my expectations were high. Fortunately, I got a whiff of this Aroma, and walked upstairs to see what it was all about.   Right off the bat, I could tell I made the right choice. The staff were friendly and set me up with a spot despite the fact that I was taking my food to go. I ordered the lamb korma and some samosas, the latter of which I decided to eat on the spot - and even though they were so hot that they literally burned the skin off the inside of my mouth, I couldn't stop eating them. Arguably the best samosas I've had in the past 17 months. The crispiness, the filling, the sauces. I could eat nothing but these for the rest of my life and I could die happy. I'd probably die early, but at least it would be with a smile on my face.   I brought the lamb korma back to my hotel and it was everything you could ever want in a dish. Creamy, flavourful and with HUGE pieces of lamb. They definitely don't skimp on ingredients here, which in and of itself merits a 5-star review.   So anyway, now I'm in a food coma, just listening to the jazz station the the previous guest forgot to turn off. Or maybe the hotel turns it on before guests get to their rooms. I dunno and it doesn't matter. The point is, go eat here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"After a nice TSO symphony at Roy Thomson Hall, my friends and I accidentally stumbled upon this cozy, intimate place. I love indian food because they offer an array of vegetarian options. We ordered mostly vegetarian dishes ( obviously) including Tandoiri Machi which was delicious! The fish just melts in your mouth. We also ordered this dish called Saag with spinach puree and potatoes - it looks like baby poo lol but it was yummy! Not to mention their butter chicken!   It was a wonderful way to end the night - they will definitely be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is like a steal - no question. $16 tip & tax included. If you're a big eater and enjoy Indian food in general, you have to be there at least once, if not frequently.  The dinner menu is fair. Good place to eat on the way home from a baseball game, but can be pricey.  Decor is O.K. except the tables are a bit too close to each other. Service has been great."}
{"text":"This has been the best meal I've had since being in Toronto. Excellent food, polite staff, clean venue. Very flavorful and great prices."}
{"text":"We were here from Los Angeles last year and still talk about the shrimp curry we had here! Everything was amazing from the curry to the naan bread & saffron rice! we hope to be back next time we visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Maybe. Don't go off lunch hours because you're gonna get old food. Maybe it would be better during peak times."}
{"text":"We didn't have much here, the okra vegetarian dish was good. They have a great use of spices. The service could have been better. We had to wait a long time to get more water and to get the check."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for Indian lunch buffet. They never replaced any of the food while we were there though, and the service is less than friendly. The food is decent."}
{"text":"Walking through the unassuming front door and up the stairs, we were pleasantly surprised at what we found. The door opened into a quiet well laid out restaurant. We were greeted by a server within a minute, immediately shown to a table, (we did make a reservation about a week prior).  Our drink order was taken and quickly delivered to our table along with a basket of crackers and dip, (both were delicious). Our food arrived within 10 minutes of being ordered. My girlfriend, recently returned from a tour of India, said it was the best she had had in Canada. Me, it was better than any I'd had in my 12 years working in Brampton. After we had eaten, we sat and enjoyed our wine with no pressure to pay our bill and leave. In fact had to ask the waiter for our bill. It arrived promptly. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone that wishes to experience true Indian food."}
{"text":"Meh......I've had better Indian fare at other restaurants.  Met my niece downtown and the 3 of us decided on Indian fare. None of us had dined here prior to this visit, but we've all heard good things about.   It was the opening night of the Leafs season and they were playing Montreal, so this area of the city was electrified (the Princess of Wales theatre is kitty corner to this restaurant as well) ...however the restaurant was a nice sanctuary from the crowds ( which we could not hear once inside).   Decor is nice, nothing to write home about. If you suffer from mobility issues, this place will be difficult for you as it's on the 2nd floor of the building. The bathroom is located another level up from the dining room (3rd floor).   Food, at best, is good, not stellar...I've had comparable food items at other restaurants that were better and less expensive. Service was very good - friendly, but not in an in your face kind of way.  Our order was as follows:  Chicken Tikka Masala - the best dish of the night. Rich in flavours, nice heat. Butter Chicken - it was lukewarm (temperature wise) which I didn't care for. It was also in the sweet side. Disappointing for me, but one of my dining companions said he thought is was excellent. Lamb Biriyani- rich in flavours but the lamb was a tad overcooked. Gharam Masala - no heat at all, but had a nice, complex flavour to it. Basmati rice - you can't really screw this dish up. Nann bread - excellent, but a bit on the oily side.  Like I stated earlier...it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had and it wasn't the worst. Perhaps the hype I heard about this place set my expectations a bit higher.  Dinner as ordered above, with a diet coke, coke and 2 beers came to just under $85. Tip brought it close to $100.   Would I go back? If in the area again I might...or I might just wander up to Babur on Queen St."}
{"text":"Aroma is hidden away on King Street, right above a Second Cup and Subway Sandwich shop. This place is very busy for weekday lunch, but there's plenty of seating. The servers were attentive in refilling water.  The food was pretty good, even for a lunch buffet. There isn't a lot of variety, but sufficient enough food to feel full. There were vegetable pakoras, butter chicken, samosas, chana masala, aloo ghobi, papadum, naan, etc. It was a little bit of everything. For dessert, they have ice cream and galub jamun. The galub jamun was cold, which I thought was weird.  Good food, but nothing particularly special. I'll definitely be back, though."}
{"text":"Average food, and pathetic service! Waiters behave as if they are paid to be rude and arrogant..Given the choices around I am never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Since I am reviewing this several months after the fact, my memory is somewhat dim so my review will probably be relatively useless. oh well.  general impressions. Stopped in for the lunch buffet and thought it was pretty decent.  Nothing blew my mind, but the selection was good, the price was not horrible, and the service was decent.  Would I make a special trip to Toronto just to try it out?  No, but it was alright."}
{"text":"This place definitely has some of the best Indian food I've ever tasted! The naan is to die for! Servers are friendly and on occasion, the manager will come around to ask how everything is going. Restaurant is quite small and intimate but the ambiance is delightful. Expect it to be packed during the weekends, and especially on a Friday night. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Context: I went for dinner on a weekend night with my family. We ordered an assortment of appetizers and curries, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This was my third visit to Aroma in the last 12 months.  Pros: Reservation was easily available on a Saturday night for a large group. The restaurant seemed fairly busy. Downtown location is easily accessible.  Cons: The food quality was mediocre. Portion sizes were small for the price. The service was surprisingly slow compared to my previous visits.  Will I return? Probably not.   Disclaimer: All member of my family are born and raised in India and are well aware of authentic Indian flavours."}
{"text":"I think I'm a pretty good critic. \"This muffin tastes bad.\" Anyway, I went here with a friend for the dinner service on a Friday. Ordered the paneer with naan and my friend had a masala Chai. Overall, the quality was fine, perhaps slightly bland for my tastes but likely right up the alley for the King St. patrons. I did think it was too pricey for what I actually got, but again, that's probably the King St. factor at play. Service was great, very prompt and attentive. Overall not a terrible option if you're around the area and need a hearty meal."}
