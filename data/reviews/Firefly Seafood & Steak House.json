{"text":"This place does not even deserve 1 star. The service was very disappointing. My waitress was playing with her phone and it was almost impossible to get their attention. Not only that, she was giving me attitude for no apparent reason.   Food was okay. Service was not. I would never go back there again. Ugh"}
{"text":"This place is so terrible and I'll never return again.  Service was mediocre and the food is really below average. Tasteless and bland. The intrusive servers love to gossip about customers (it happened to us and other people as well)."}
{"text":"Food is quite good and portions are big.  Service could be a little bit better and friendlier, Their dishes are very tasty, but a little bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Been coming to here for many years, was pretty good with the value I paid. But food quality and tastes are both getting worse, annoying with flies every where , ordered an AAA steak lunch, but literally not a steak at all, maybe a thick piece of beef or flank steak."}
{"text":"The food is terrible! Everything tastes bland, worse than fast food or even canned food. Hope I never have to come here again."}
{"text":"Needs many improvements. I really hope management reads this.   Vegetables that come with the meals aren't cooked thoroughly. I feel like I'm eating raw veggies, and they are also tasteless.   Bortsch soup is too spicy.   Portions are good- too much food though.   Previous management was SO MUCH BETTER.  Decor is tacky. Keep it simple!   Menu is way too big and confusing. They need to minimize the options.    This place can be SO MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a friend around 11pm Friday night when it was empty. Frankly, I was sceptical since I'm a vegetarian and this is not exactly a vegetarian friendly place. However, the hostess was very accommodating. We ordered an Atlantic salmon for my friend and seafood pasta for myself. The hostess added extra veggies to the pasta and have all the cooked seafood on the side which my friend happily devoured. The portions were quite large and well cooked. I would even say that the pasta was better than east side Mario's. Got a soup, bread and a drink along with the meal and I was a satisfied camper. Total came to be about $40 for 2 people after tax and tip"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with terrible service and even a little racism to really ruin my experience. Not worth it for the few bucks you save. Steak and lobster is decent for the price, but the pasta and sides are essentially just over-salted garbage. Not even as good as the just add water stuff you get in a paper envelope at the grocery stuff. Although I somewhat expected the food to be kind of weak, I never expected to be treated so rudely and actually get a nasty little taste of racial slurs.  I went with my Chinese girlfriend and her parents. The server brought just her and I's order quickly, so as to not be rude, we waited before eating. Unfortunately, the server had forgotten to put my future in-laws order in. When we reminded them we were waiting on the other two meals, they said they'd check on it, but no updates or apologies came as we waited a total of 25 minutes before the parents' plates came. In that time, obviously the first two dinners were pretty cold having been sitting there, being picked at, waiting for almost half an hour waiting for the seniors at the table to receive their food too. After eating a bit of the chilled meal, I quietly went to speak to the assistant manager. Politely and off the restaurant floor, so as to not cause a scene, I reminded her how bad the timing of the food delivery was and requested some food be taken off the bill as it was not enjoyable once it was cold. She brushed me off and said she'd talk to her manager who was \"out buying groceries\". She approached our table a couple minutes later without waiting for the manager to return. Instead of addressing me personally and politely, as I had done when making my complaint, she chose to ignore me and address the parents instead. I think it was pretty clear that I was the only one at the table who probably wouldn't understand Chinese. She said loudly, in Chinese, \"This isn't a gwai lo restaurant, we can't afford to just give food away.\" Offering them a 5% discount  along with that little hateful gem. But at no time acknowledging me, the person who raised the concern in the first place.  Long story short, poor quality food and the worst, most disrespectful service. Never again."}
{"text":"The price went up sooo much here and the service is truely lacking. The waitress confused herself with the order then started yelling at us. Last time i will ever come here."}
{"text":"Food is ok here, price is ok, service is ok.  Nothing really special about it, but it's a Hong Kong style western restaurant that is pretty consistent.  The space is large enough to accomodate large parties, and the menu is large and diverse so it's good for group gatherings.  It's also large enough that if you have kids, you can generally request a less populated area of the restaurant and have a little more room for them if they want to move around"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite in Firefly is the Black Peppercorn Chicken Steak. The skin of the chicken is crispy and the meat is moist and juicy which makes you want to scoop more rice with the delicious sauce into your mouth. And for that special indulgence, order a sunny side fried egg with your chicken steak and you will not regret it. To accompany your delicious protein, I would almost always order an iced Ying Yeung tea which is an iced drink of equal parts coffee and tea with sweetened syrup for you to add as desired. It has become a weekend tradition of mine. If the large portion of the sizzling chicken meal does not satisfy you, you may like to order the Corned Beef with Egg Sandwich to snack on at home because I sure did."}
{"text":"I've only tried the afternoon tea menu here. It can get busy during the weekend but we did not have to wait a long time to be seated & served. Food & price were decent. The red bean with ice cream is watery but if you mix in the ice cream, it does give it some taste. I do not like super sweet food/ drinks which might be why I actually like this. I also liked their fried vermicelli & pancakes (more like roti) with curry. The other dishes that I've tried are average at best. Maybe we should explore their lunch menu the next time; we've seen other people order from the lunch menu & it looks yummy... I wonder if it tastes as good as it looks."}
{"text":"We order a set dinner for two. The Lobster Bisque is so salty, or too much MSG,  and is not consumable The Tiger Shrimp in Garlic with Fillet of Sole in cream sauce came with cold veggie The sauce for the Tiger Shrimp in Garlic with Fillet of Sole in cream sauce cannot even classified as sauce It is cheap, $24 for two, but still I won't go back because of bad food and bad service  This restaurant used to be one of my favourate ;("}
{"text":"Food is alright, prices are cheap. Service isnt the best, they dont really pay attention Food takes forever to get to the table"}
{"text":"Worst HK Cafe I have been in my entire life. The red bean drink had no taste, no cream, just melted ice. When I complained, they brought sugar water and told me to mix it well."}
{"text":"HK-style cafe @ First Markham Place on Hwy 7.   Lunch average $8-12 would include a main dish(rice/pasta), soup, bun and drink.  Dinner $12-18 average.  Service is fast and the place is roomy.  Portion is good.    Quality/Taste is average within the class.  Yes, please do not expect top quality food with this price.  But it's reasonable.   I do love the bun that comes with the soup =) (not a lot of places serve the bun anymore.. sometimes i come here just for that!)"}
{"text":"We have had lunch and dinner here a few times and is a 3 star level~ acceptable and the price is good.  Went here for Breakfast recently and it just wasn't good. We had the gold standards for HK breakfast- Satay beef Instant Noodle- noodles were overcooked. I tried the Korean Kimchi Instant Noodle with Inaki Mushroom Beef Wraps- noodles undercooked and beef not seasoned. At this point Gordon Ramsay was screaming in my head.  The Egg Sandwiches, which are so awesome elsewhere, just weren't great. The service though, was excellent."}
{"text":"Food is reasonable at a decent price. Just another Hong Kong style restaurant. It is a good place for group and family, and for quick and filling set meals."}
{"text":"This HK style restaurant is one of those that still provide reasonably good quality with the price.  The price on the menu is unbelievably low.   The portion is big and can fill you up easily.  My friends have to pack them.  For a steak it is only about $16.  For a special for 2 that you can choose from a whole list of appetizer and entr√©e, it only costs $20+.  The Chicken is tender with spaghetti.  The lobster bisque is ok when you know the price.  It cannot be compared to those lobster dining restaurant that charges you a lot more for the same soup.  The steak looks good.  It comes with a drink at the end of the meal.  At that price, you cannot beat it.  Remember it is not a fine dining restaurant and a very affordable family restaurant."}
{"text":"I only go there for breakfast. They usually have good waiters but this one time there is this Chinese waitress with long ponytail (pink highlights) who treated us badly. We were there for like 20 mins still no tea on he table. So we asked her for tea. After 10 mins we asked the second time. She literally yelled at as and said \"someone is going around with the water YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT OK!?!!?!!\" We asked nicely both times and she reacted like we killed her mother. And we paid tips for this kind of \"service\". What ends up happening was that she had to personally bring the water to us. Why lie?"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after passing by a few times. It's located in the plaza in first Markham place. Walking in, the decor feels dated. We we're sited almost immediately. This place advertises itself as an Asian steakhouse. So naturally, I ordered the steak + fries (it comes with rice / pasta but you can add $1 to swap it to fries). It came fairly quickly.   The presentation of the dish looked like it came out of those minute dinner plates. The steak was small and the fries had a darker golden color to them. It didn't taste any better than it looked. The steak was overcooked and over salted, the fries were greasy and soft. The funny thing was, the waitress never asked how I'd like my steak even though it's suppose to be a steak restaurant.   You can easily find better asian style steak places that offers better tasting food."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could but decided to give 1 star because the buns were very warm and fluffy and the milk tea at the end is also very good.   Came for the buy one get one free dinner special. The staff were very friendly and spoke cantonese to my family, however got a bit aggressive when we said we wanted a medium rare steak in english instead of saying medium rare in cantonese. I wasn't aware it was a fusion(??) restaurant and even now I'm not sure if its fusion. Got vibes that it was itallian-themed or at least itallian inspired but the food tasted like those frozen TV dinners that you get from the super market. Sauce was super thick and started developing a shell at the top once it cooled and food was not well seasoned. Noodles were hard and fish fillets tasted like plastic -- not even sure what kind of fish was served, waitresses refused to answer / didn't know the answer!   All in all, was disgusted, confused, and overall not pleased with my meal despite it being cheap. But I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've been to my share of Chinese steak and seafood places, and this place really takes the cake!   Everything that gets pushed out the kitchen is super tasty, but it comes out oddly fast.   I didn't give it a perfect rating because the service is lacking. To moderately rude staff to not even paying attention to you at times, even when you try to flag someone down.  My boyfriend is a non-believer in this place, because last time we went and split the bill, he gave roughly a 10% tip because he wasn't too happy with the service, and the waitress speedily came running back to our table demanding more tip than what was offered.  I guess I'm pushing 3 stars due to their food, which really should be a 4 1/2, but needed to dumb it down due to the service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Chinese operated restaurant famous for its steaks. It's also good for Hong Kong style breakfast. It also serves bubble tea drinks."}
{"text":"I've coming to this place for afternoon tea. (Usually before 6pm) they have great meal combos that come with a drink. Lots of selection from pork chops to chicken wings to soup noodles. Quality is consistent. Never had any issues with the food or servers. If you come In for morning breakfast they provide you with newspaper for free (but it's in Chinese only)."}
{"text":"Firefly located in First Markham Place served big portion for low price.  I been here for afternoon tea a couple times and it was okay.  The chicken wings are decent and french toast was not bad as well.  You get free red bean freeze with ice-cream with any combo ordered.  The red bean freeze is pretty bad as it is watery and hardly any flavour.  The cream sauce spaghetti is decent as well but nothing here will blow you away.  The place itself is nice and big with lots of booths on the side.  It looks relatively clean compare to another diners in the area.  They used to have $6.99 minute steak for lunch special but that is over.  The minute steak was pretty good as it wasn't chewy and cooked to medium rare as I requested.  Overall, I prefer other Chinese HK style restaurant before Firefly Seafood & Steak House.  Rating:  Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 3/5"}
{"text":"I have this love hate relationship with this place.  If you are from Hong Kong, you may know what I mean.  It is kind of western food that is cater to people from Hong Kong without the broth made from scratch, lower quality ingredients and pretending to be a steakhouse sort of restaurant.  I like to come becausr my parents wants to eat something that feels like western food but do not want to spend too much money.    The Christmas menu seems promising with lobster bisque, salmon salad, 8 oz striploin and cheesecake.  I could tell the lobster bisque was made from scratch since there were pieces of lobster shells still in my soup.  What?!!!  I was glad that I was able to pick them out, but what if you can't.  Sigh~ When I requested the striploin to be cooked medium rare, the waitress was telling me there's no such thing.  I was like, \"Huh, are you sure?\"  Then, she gave me a blank stare and said, \"ok.\"    The salad was just like what you have store bought from supermarket.  The marsh pototoes was really tasty and creamy and the striploin was cooked to medium rare perfection.  The cheesecake was an after-thought as it was really bland with not much flavour.    When I paid, I was expecting them more tip to return the differnece and I would pay them the tip.  But the difference of my payment and bill was nowhere to be found.  When I ask for the change, they just gave me the bill.  At first, I thought it was Christmas, I was going to tip them more.  But if they wanted to keep the change, be my guest.   I was totally dissatisfied with the customer service provided even though the main dish was quite good.  Hopefully, none of my friends or family want to come this place any time soon."}
{"text":"My last experience here was terrible.  Food was so-so but HK style food is nothing gourmet anyways.  But the main reason I gave this place a 1-star rating was the result of poor service and horrible attitude from the servers.  They obviously do not ask their servers to be polite.  It feels as if they are paying for my meal and I should be forever grateful to them for serving me food I ordered and paid for.  Will not ever go here again for bad service."}
{"text":"The staffs were doing loud construction (Drilling & hammering) for repairing their booth seats while customers were trying to enjoy their dinner.. why couldn't they wait until closing? A few moments after, my friend found a nasty bug in her cold milk tea and the staff didn't offer her any discounts or anything."}
{"text":"Man, I haven't been here in years! My family and I were trying to decide where to go for an afternoon meal, and stumbled into Firefly.  It was a lot busier than I thought it would be, but it was probably only just for the afternoon tea specials they had. A meal with a beverage included, it is a pretty good deal with prices ranging from $4.99 to $7.99. Just be careful what you order as toast is a whopping $4.99!  I decided to go for a Meat Sauce Linguini, which wasn't all that great, but decent... I literally couldn't decide on what to get, so kind of just pick it. The drink was a Red Bean and Grass Jelly Mix, and was also just alright. Didn't eat much of the red beans, as the balance was a bit off with too much red bean, but not enough grass jelly.   The server definitely didn't have any cares to give, with emotionless words and a face that wouldn't move even with a hard smack! Service was okay, but kind of a sad overall experience.   I remember why I don't come here, and definitely will remember for the next time!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't usually give one star but from what you know about me. Bad service = one star cause that trumps everything else. Honestly I don't come here because I know there's bad service here and when people I know wants to come here it reminds me of why I didn't want to come here in the first place. Plain decor + lackluster food + bad attitude = one star.   So seeing their \"special\" menu: some buy one get one free meal 26 bux gimmick makes me think maybe this won't be so bad. You get lobster bisque and can choose two entrees plus drink and \"dessert\". So we tried to order this where we both want the lobster entree. However we were rudely told by the server lady that we can do the bogof deal but can only order one lobster entree. What kind of bogof deal is this?!? When you can't even order two of the same thing? And it doesn't say anywhere on the menu about this. If it was in the fine print maybe that was fair. So then we had to settle for a second shrimp dish which was terrible. The lobster bisque was fine, I feel like there was some lobster taste to it but it was hard to tell if it came from a can, because it has a canned soup feel to it. Comes w a butter bun. The baked lobster w cheese (terrible cheese) w linguine and clam and mushroom sauce was okay. The lobster seemed fresh. The pasta was meh the sauce was tasteless. It had lots of onions some mushroom and maybe three canned clams but had no taste.  Unfortunately being a HK-style bistro the HK milk tea wasn't even good, tasteless, not strong just tastes like cream. And the \"dessert\" was a mysterious flavor orange color jello with canned mixed fruits inside, it was terrible I didn't eat it.   Now, for this rude lady. She seems to hate her job, didn't want to come take our order. Came and was abrupt and curt in taking our order. We asked for plates to eat the buns with and she didn't want to give us that many. Everytime she brings a dish she just plops it in the middle loudly. The other waitress wasn't that much better she tried to argue w us when she made a mistake.   Overall bad experience, bad service, washrooms weren't clean, food less than average. I hope I don't have to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely garbage.. I usually don't give one stars,  but holy.  My friend got a instant noodle with meat sauce on the late night menu.  The instant noodle looked like a week old and microwaved,  the meat was rubbery and tasted disgusting.  Will never come back and highly suggest you guys not come."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just really hungry, but this place was the only place that was still open when I got to First Markham (not to mention their neon signs). I got one of their special steak dinners, which included cream soup and milk tea for about $15. It wasn't bad, but maybe it's just I was hungry. So if you tend to get hungry around midnight on weekdays, this place will be open for you!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday for dinner. I was starving and was excited to try their 23.99 set dinner. Despite being really hungry, I wasn't able to finish my meal and didn't want to pack it back home (portions are big though) The service wasn't as bad as others here described it, but the food... Had an overload of MSG. We ordered the lobster linguine and the italian sausage with shrimp. Both dishes were super salty, but also had this aftertaste reminiscent of airplane or microwaveable food. The lobster bisque was also very salty and felt more like a gravy than a soup. I think it was overloaded with starch and thickeners. Overall, the most enjoyable part of the meal was the lemon water I ordered at the end and the bread they serve in the beginning. Many glasses of water later... I'm still really thirsty!"}
{"text":"Fist time came here, not impressive. I decided to give it a try again but still disappointed. Customer service: poor The waitress took my order wrong, that she wrote spaghetti when I asked for rice. When the second waitress served me the spaghetti, I told her immediately this was wrong. So the waitress came back and argued with me said I did not mention anything about the rice.  Food: so-so For this price point, I could get more tasty food elsewhere.  I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Was craving HK milk tea so ended up coming here, and it tasted like your standard HK milk tea at HK cafes, so I was happy. Tried out their buy one get one free dinner (#1 and #4) and oyster with garlic and butter, I'd say that the lobster wasn't bad. It was a little bit over cooked though, but the flavour was decent. I liked my pasta Al dente, which to my surprise, that's how they make their pasta. I didn't even ask for al dente because I don't really have high expectations for this restaurant. But honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. The sauce on the pasta was a bit weird... I guess it's the Chinese version of Alfredo, it was starchy and creamy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't really Alfredo sauce. I wouldn't recommend the BBQ Sirloin skewer on the BOGO menu."}
{"text":"What can I say.. Food came out frozen. Service is just above mediocre. They missed our order and they rushed the food. Plus the wait time for the food was an hour long.  I will not come back ever again."}
{"text":"Firefly is a long time restaurant here in FMP, never packed, and good for big groups. They are very slow on serving the dishes and we have had cold dishes come out of the kitchen (probably stayed there too long)?  They offer different steaks, lobsters, and baked pasta dishes here.  Good deal only when you buy it with their combo (usually comes with a crab/lobster bisque soup and salad and dessert)."}
{"text":"I stopped coming here after a specific incident of sub-par service. Let me get to that in a bit. First, the food is alright. It's very typical HK cafe style dinner food that's not particularly outstanding, nor particularly inexpensive. I've never had a problem with it. The portions are big and will fill you up. One thing I really like is the space. It's quite comfortable and tables are adequately spaced out.   Now service is the reason why I'm giving it such a low rating. First of all, they're pretty slow and inattentive. Takes awhile to wave someone down and pressing the little button on the table to call them over is a hit or miss. Now onto specifics. I came here with my friend once and she ordered a typical tuna sandwich. Let me be clear, my friend is very passive and we are rarely the type to raise a complaint unless there is any real reason to. Her tuna sandwich had the tiniest smidgen of tuna on it. It was like someone took a single teaspoon of tuna, put it in the middle of the piece of bread, and squished it together to hopefully spread it out more. My friend inquired the waiter about it and her response was a very blunt: \"that's just the way it is.\"   No, I really don't think it is. I've never seen another HK style restaurant be so cheap with something so insignificant (it's canned tuna for goodness sake..). Having grown up on HK cafes, I am also used to the usual \"bluntness\" of Cantonese servers, but this was just unreasonable. Either way, there was no point in arguing with someone who clearly doesn't prioritize the customer. We just left it at that and never came back.  (5/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I like the service here. I think they change the waitress. Food is pretty good here. if you order more then $30 you get a extra lobster or steak dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not for it's price. The quantity to price ratio is a bit off. There are better HK cafe's in the area that are give better portions for it's price. Seating is comfortable and service was okay. I recommend going for their tea time specials. Dinner can be quite pricey and portioned a bit small."}
{"text":"This place is the worst display of service ever imaginable. They are the definition of cheap and rude. Me and my friends went in and they almost did not give us the student special dispite the fact that we are all students under 18.  The server was rude the entire time and the moment after we sat down, he walked over to the kitchen and was like \"fucking student menus again\". The food was okay but if you want better you can just go to McDonalds. Some of their specials are limited to one dish per table and most of their deals aren't available if you don't spend enough money.  This is the second time we've been here and I am not sure why we came back to this garbage dump.  The first time we came here, after we tipped the server 10%, she asked us for more and asked us why we didn't tip more.  I don't know the laws about not paying but if I knew them I would not pay for this shitty experience. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I frequent HK cafes quite often, and my first impression of this place is that it is quite expensive in comparison to similar places around the area. I like how spacious the restaurant is, and how there is a lot of variety of dishes. They also have an ambiance with their romantic 2 set dinner specials catering towards a cute date night.  Each dish order comes with either Russian Borsche/Cream Soup with dinner rolls. Bread is rarely served these days so it was a pleasant surprise! Also there is a tea to drink (the lemon tea is really bitter) as well as dessert (lychee jelly with condensed milk)   Linguini Bolognese (~$8) - i like how they changed it up from spaghetti. Generous portion of cheddar.  Chicken Sizzling Steak (~$15)-  served with veggies and onions. I've had better though.  Probably won't come back unless it's for afternoon tea. It's overpriced!"}
{"text":"Firefly Seafood & Steak House is one of those very long lasting traditional HK style cafe restaurants, despite its history in Markham, I was very disappointed with the food and services in my most recent visit.  I ordered a bolognese spaghetti which is a very simple food item on all HK style cafe menu and they could not make it any worst.  The spaghetti had no flavour and it felt like i was eating water boiled spaghetti with some creamy light red sauce on top.  The drink that comes with it was not good either, I ordered a iced milk tea and once again it felt like I was drinking iced water.  Lastly, the service is horrendous, it took the waiter 4 times to write our order AND to give us the bills at the end.  There are WAY better HK cafes within driving distance and I would never come here again.  The only positive about this place is their breakfast menus are still okay from what I remember, but maybe that went downhill also."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for lunches and it's been meeting expectations decently almost every time. Our party of 2 generally each order a set lunch, which comes with a soup and a drink.  They're about $7-8 which is a tad bit higher than the price at some other places, but still a well reasonable lunch budget.  The vibe and atmosphere here is a lot more low-key than most other HongKong style restaurants.  Their food portions are what you would expect, not too large, not too small, and each person can typically finish their plate without trouble.    The service really changes from time to time, and it's honestly all random,  Sometimes the waitresses will be very keen and but other times, they can be extremely ignorant and frustrating to deal with, so it's honestly just a bit of luck in all of this.  Not a bad restaurant, would come back occasionally, but there are definitely better Hong Kong style places out there instead!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few years. Everything was about the same as my previous experiences at this restaurant. Inexpensive menu deals, service not so great, food presentation was nice, but taste was so-so... more towards bland than flavourful.  The BOGO dinner was worth a try. As soon as the orders were served, we knew immediately that we wouldn't be able to finish... Had to ask for boxes to pack the pasta and rice. I was so full from the soup, dinner rolls, main course, dessert, and milk tea!"}
{"text":"So first of all, I need to let y'all know that I've only had breakfast here, so I can only comment on how the breakfast is...not lunch..not dinner..only breakfast...read other reviews for lunch/dinner..  Anyways, the price is acceptable for uptown breakfast is considerably ok...and breakfast...really...how can ANYONE screw up on that..it's as easy as ABC...Lol..=D  scrambled eggs, toast..stuff you can make at home but too lazy to do so...the milk tea is seriously not there...which kinda disappoints me because the milk tea is very important in an HK style cafe..this is where the focus should be on...make better milk tea peoples!!  the milk tea was not bold but became bitter....nahhs to the milk tea...an A-ok for the food, comfort level, and service..."}
{"text":"I've only been to Firefly for lunch and I have to say they do a pretty good job. The lunch specials generally come with a sweet bun, soup (make sure you order the cream soup!) and the main dish.  The issue is half the dishes are pretty bad while the other ones are pretty good so this is definitely not the place to be adventurous. But if you see steak, don't expect Keg style, it's more like a sliver (1/2 inch thick type steak).  Either way their service is fast, food is decent and prices are not too bad (lunch specials run from $6 - 8)."}
{"text":"Came here with my family which consisted of 5 people. The focus at this HK style restaurant is more western lunch/dinner sets. Most meals come with choice of soup (cream, Russian borsch) and tea/coffee. You can expect an assortment of pork, chicken, beef and fish steak with various sauces and choice of rice or spaghetti. That's pretty much it. If you go for the lobster meals, there are many other restaurants that do it better and at a comparative price. Don't expect any amazing quality as the meat is low quality and dishes are salty but which HK styles restaurants aren't. Acceptable if you want your lunch fix with little interaction between you and the wait staff."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this restaurant. The food is below average, the service is awful, and they are apparently unable to split bills between people.   The worst thing about this is that they expect huge tips for this type of service! We literally had the restaurant manager come up to us, and demand that we pay a higher tip - absolutely stunning to see this in action. We just walked out and ignored them."}
{"text":"We were really craving a sizzling plate last night, and we ended up here at Firefly. For $16.99, you get a whole meal. Beef Tendeloin on sizzling plate with a soup and dinner roll starter, a side of rice or spaghetti, dessert of questionable jello and a drink.  I got the borsch soup which was standard. Dinner roll was good, could have used some extra butter.  The beef itself was not bad at all, true to it's name, the tenderloin was quite tender. I got it with the garlic sauce which was a little disappointing. It didn't taste anything like garlic. Just a gravy. It came with a LOT of broccoli and a big portion of rice.   The jello was very strange.. it tasted very.. bad (for lack of a better word). It had some pieces of fruit in it, and they were mushy and sour and gross.  We had to pay $1 extra for a cold drink which is normal for most of these places.   Not bad for a sizzling plate fix. But next time I'll try another place.   After tax and tip it was about $22 per person."}
{"text":"The deal was great. $25 for dinner for two. Comes with 2 main courses from the menu, 2 lobster bisque and afternoon tea in case you did not understand the menu. The English can be a bit confusing as it says 'Buy 1 get 1 free for $25'.   The lobster bisque is very diluted in my opinion. Wish it was thicker. The duck and lobster was delicious but if could've been because I was super hungry. After the meal you get tea or coffee with a mango pudding dessert with condensed milk. Food was A-OK.  However, service could've been better. There was a bell at our table but even after we pressed it, it took a while for them to come as they forgot about us, so we had to press it again. I felt we had to constantly remind them we were missing our soups as the food came out of order. The last time we rang the bell, they assumed we were getting the bill, and of course we had to remind them we did not have our tea/coffee yet. I felt it was unnecessary for us to remind them all the time and they were not apologetic about it at all.   They also take debit or cash."}
{"text":"I have dined at Firefly Seafood and Steakhouse several times over the past 6 years, as recently as last night, and I feel that Jennifer K.'s review of 1 star is overly harsh.  I agree that the food is not comparable to the Keg, Lonestar or Kelsey's but you do receive good value for quantity and decent quality.  For dinner last night we selected 2 options from a menu of 20+ set dinners.  Each set dinner includes chinese tea, a warm and soft bread dinner bun/roll, a choice of cream or borsch/vegetable soup (which I prefer), main dish, beverage and small dessert (jello).  Prices range from $10 to $20-30 depending on the main dish.  My wife had the grilled pork chop in red wine sauce with a side of rice and veggies (picture added).  The sauce was too strong on the red-wine taste but the pork was sufficiently tender.  The veggies were boiled to acceptable cooking level.  I had the chicken steak and sirloin roll (thin beef rolled with mushrooms inside) in a mushroom gravy.  The chicken was slightly over-cooked while the beef rolls looked more appetizing than they actually were.  Not that they were bad, it just looked like it should have been delicious but it wasn't.  It was merely \"good\".  Although you wouldn't go to an HK-style restaurant for the decor or other accoutrements the orange theme and booth-style seating is functional and acceptable.  Several flatscreen TVs hang from the ceiling and are tuned into sports and a variety of chinese programs.  I didn't visit the restrooms but if you don't have to go, I wouldn't.    3 stars may be a bit optimistic but this is a solid 2.5 star establishment."}
{"text":"It's a western HK style restaurant.  their French toast is my personal fav go to breakfast because it's so affordable.  As for dinner, I love how they have Russian borscht soup. They also have promos- like buy one dinner get one half off.  In those promos there's like lobster pieces which is a pretty good deal.  In terms of quality, it's alright/okay. Customer service is very direct and a bit MIA. Not the best, but it's alright"}
{"text":"I ordered hk style pork rice with tomato sauce for late night snack.  The price was $6.49 with a drink.  The price is reasonable however the dish come in a smaller size.  The taste was reasonable but could be better.  They have lots of seats available so it is ideal for a large group to go there."}
{"text":"I had been here for dinner three times which was bad impressed experience. Bad hospitality... I wish the server be courteous to customers.  Food is always served  not hot. Overall, I don't recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Not too sure why there is so much hate for this place but I did not experience anything bad or negative here. Came for the afternon specials from 2:30 to 5:30pm   Fried vermicelli $5.59 6 piece wings $6.99 curry and roti $4.59 french toast $4.29  Each dish comes with a drink so we got red bean drink with ice cream and also HK style milk tea. Portions were very small but for the price you can't go wrong.   Everything tasted good but the French toast was made with extra love. Deep fried with peanut butter inside, crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. Syrup and butter to top it off. OMG. If only I had a deep fryer at home I would sooo make this all the time.   Wings were also done very well. Very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And they did not hold back with the honey garlic sauce.  Very good prices, food tasted good, service was efficient."}
{"text":"Man the food is the best but little costly man the steak is so good just a little dry almost as good of how I cook. The drinks are the bomb but only is ok. Service is good, have wifi, only the place is little loud for me."}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad food. Stay away!   We came in, giving this place a chance but was greeted with bad attitude. Looking the menu over I couldn't see the list of drinks available so I asked the server if he could bring over the drink menu, instead gave very snappy replies I didn't think much of it, & decided not to order any drinks. When our food came, we realized we were only given spoons. I also wanted another glass of cold water. The waiter told me, he'd get it right away, but he forgot. When I reminded him again he said, \"you can ask someone's else, you know\". I would have appreciated a 'sorry I forgot' but instead he tried to push the responsibility off of himself. The tables beside us never finished any of their food, & neither did we. This is a horrible place to go."}
{"text":"Ever since they changed the chefs (happened in the middle of last year or so), this place has taken a 90 degree tumble in terms of food quality.  What used to be one of my favs, the sirloin beef in korean spicy noodle soup, the beef is now rock hard, and the noodles are mushy. It used to be round, just like how images would show in an instant noodle package.  The steak itself has also grown hard, no matter how well done you want it. It's hard regardless.  The amount of missed orders has also increased significantly. Twice in the past three times at least one part of our order never showed up for over 30 minutes. And when it did, it was either overcooked, dry, hard...basically I would've been better off cancelling the order.  Nevertheless, I don't know why I still come here. Maybe the free wifi, but still."}
{"text":"This is like any other Hong Kong styled restaurant. The food is decent at a decent price. The service....well, not the best. The waitresses aren't rude, it's just difficult to get their attention!  We ordered a set dinner menu and the most memorable thing was the dessert. Most places give ice cream or tong sui. However, this place gave a mango pudding which was different and refreshing. We also ordered a lobster and it was done quite well.  With so many options around this area, this restaurant wouldn't be my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Not good. Canned cream soup with old beans to start. A really good dinner roll with butter and a very bland and tasteless curry. Also ordered pork chops on tomato sauce with rice and cheese. Not bad but definitely noting to write about. Service was good even thought the nice lady didn't speak any English."}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast since it was right next to our hotel.  Satay Beef Instant Noodles - Satay Beef was super garlicky - Instant Noodles and the soup were too salty...  HK Milk Tea was decent.  ...my stomach didn't feel too well after breakfast...maybe they left the beef out for too long?"}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and had dinner here. I ordered spaghetti bolognese ($ 7.99) w/ the soup (cream or tomato based), tea, dessert combo (just about $3 more). The service was good & fast. They served me the soup 5 mins after I ordered. I enjoy the hk style spaghetti bolognese & their other pastas here cuz the portion is huge and u can easily pack it for lunch the next day.   I didn't have time for the hk style tea & dessert but they only charged me for the spaghetti  which was nice. I would come back here again cuz it's cheap, fast & not too bad. but this is def. no place for steak. Also, I remember ordering pork chop w/ fried rice on two separate occasions and one time the pork chop had a lot of fat on it.   Fridays/weekends are extremely busy. Lots of parking though."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in ages. We stopped by for a quick dinner on a Friday night and we were not disappointed. We ordered a sizzling short ribs and prawns with a baked rice. Both were delicious. Although you are paying an extra $2 for your meal vs. other hk cafes. It seemed worth it for the quality of the dishes we received."}
{"text":"This place is very unsanitary.  Here is what you should look for when you enter any restaurant.   The floors: a sanitary restaurant always keeps their floor clean at all times  The washroom: sanitary restaurants NEVER neglect their washroom conditions.   The environment: look out for any presence of insects.  This place failed on all perspectives.   Their service also fluctuates a lot - huge mood swings.  This comes directly on how the owner treats their workers.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Food not bad, but lousy service. I could not believe I got refused twice ( 2 different servers ) for just asking for a fork, as they said I would not need it. WHAT?"}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review to say the food we ordered at this time (9:30pm-10:30pm) were tasty and adequate for a wannabe-upscale HK style restaurant.  The porkchop, French toast, HK tea, bbq eel & battered shrimp met the standards we expected. When we dined here on a Thursday, the restaurant had a staff of 1 waiter, 2 waitresses, and 3-4 tables of diners who came at varying times. I mention this so readers can better rationalize my experience before excusing their service attitude due to being \"overwhelmed\" by customers. I respect and follow the etiquette and suggested guidelines for tipping, and NEVER have I encountered a disappointing experience where I walk away without tipping until now.  The food was good, and the portions were so large we had leftovers, but this was when our dining experience went downhill and possibly past the 9 rings of hell.   The only service we had was a waiter took our order, and the waiter and waitresses came with the food. Nothing further. Nobody asked \"Can I get you anything else?\"  At the end of our meal, we made eye contact and tried to get the waiter's attention (no call button). He made eye contact but continued to serve other tables, amongst them a table of 10+ who had just sat down and ordered their drinks from a waitress.  After failing to get our waiter's attention, we attempted to make eye contact and wave for any of the three servers' attention so we could get our bill and takeout boxes to pack leftovers. Minutes pass, and they were so transfixed with providing excellent customer service to the larger table that had now ordered beers, I decided to go find the takeaway boxes on my own (they were in plain view about 20 steps from our table, near their customer washrooms).  Just when I grabbed the boxes I needed, one of the waitresses approaches and says in Cantonese, \"Can I help you with something?\" and not even the slightest apology for having made us wait, or for their preoccupations elsewhere. So in response, I asked her if we can please get the bill.   I return to our table, the waiter approaches and puts down the bill. After tax, our meal came to $37.59. Implied gratuity etiquette suggests customers should give a 10% tip before taxes for services rendered. The waiter and waitresses served us food. But they did not follow through at the end of our meal (I hypothesize that's because they must have thought the bigger table of diners could give them a bigger tip at the end of the night). With this lack of service, admittedly, we gave them $40 cash and did not ask for change and that meant only 7% tip and not 10%.  The waiter stands beside us, sees the $40 cash, and doesn't take it. I thought he didn't pay attention (just like most of the evening), so I said take it and we don't need change.  He takes the bill, points at the final amount, and says he can't take the money until I put down more gratuity. My immediate reaction was \"What?\" and confusion. He repeats, that I need to give him more tip, and then he further reiterates that I need to give him more tip because the economy is bad.  As if.......the economy is not bad for everybody?  Let me rephrase: he did not say he wanted more tip because he felt it wasn't enough for his services--he wanted more tip because the economy is bad. I ask him, \"Why should I tip you more for service you didn't provide? Why should I tip more when I had to get my own takeout boxes because you ignored us?\" I ask to see his manager because I need to understand why I'm wrong. He pursed his lips and waved over a waitress.  Expecting her to rectify the situation, she also points at the bill and says that I did not tip enough because tip is \"supposed to be\" 10%.  I repeat there was a lack of service and I'm not asking for change. She repeats I'm \"supposed to\" tip 10%.  Supposed to. Has nothing to do with service.  Making my decision, I said I am not tipping 10%, and in fact, I'm now not tipping at all and want my change back.  The second waitress returned with my change, didn't apologize and also defended that 10% is mandatory. I always tip even if the service is bad, but never have I had a waiter stand around insisting that I open my wallet and give him more.  I have never waited tables, so perhaps there's a mentality to tips that I don't understand as a customer who experienced really poor service.  But penny pincher pound foolish, their insistence on me adding extra gratuity has lost 2 returning diners. The economy is bad and affects us all. You make a desperate choice and give 100% customer service to a bigger table of diners and ignore us. Based on the waiter and waitresses' defense for insisting on a 10% gratuity without acknowledging that gratuity has a positive correlation with service, I do not expect this restaurant to reflect on any of the customer reviews presented here in order to improve their service and business management."}
{"text":"Like many people who have posted on here, Firefly offers big food for low price. Other than that, there really isn't anything else going for it. The service here considering the amount of table turnover they were having simply wasn't enough. It took us a while just to get some attention so that we can have our order taken.   After our order was finally in, we got our bread appetizer which was warm, but sadly it only came with one butter. 2 breads with one butter. I asked for another one, and they said fine. Eventually our other appetizers borsch and cream soup came, out of the can soups no doubt. but sloppily put in the bowls and you can tell it spilled at one point. Come on people, clean it up. By the time I finished my appetizer, my bread was still looking at me while I waited for butter. I asked again, with one waitress said lucky for me she had one in her pocket and walked away. Unsurprisingly, it was all melted. I asked for another.   Our Salmon dishes arrived, but with finger prints all over the side edges of the dishes, I know I am not paying for premium stuff here but can I at least be served food on clean plates? It just boggles my mind. After my meal, I felt like I spent my whole time waiting on butter, which of course never came. So I left, leaving the bread on the table never fulfilling its single purpose in life. However, I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up on someone else's table, waiting for butter:("}
{"text":"Fairly low quality food.  They do have some good combos for lunch and breakfast, but generally it's not worth the price you pay.  There are tons of other cafes in the Markham area that offer western style food for a much better price and quality."}
{"text":"Firefly Seafood and Steakhouse is another Chinese-HK style restaurant at First Markham Place.  Yes price is really good... but if you come here for some good cut steak you will be disappointed!   I cannot really expect what you get from a $9.99 set dinner!  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"I only yelp when I receive terrible service. I am no picky customer but when the servers are being rude, it's something that I can not stand.  Maybe I misunderstood the servers humor but none of us (7 people) found it funny. To me, it was quite offensive. That is not a way to treat a customer and most of us pretty much agreed that we will not visit this restaurant..at least for a long long time.    At the end,  they were pretty much pushing us out of the door. When we leave, we asked him when they were closing. The waitress reply 12am. However it was indicated at the door that they close at 12:30am. I guess either the sign is not up to date or their staff just want to leave early.   Way to do business,  you just lost customers."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long long time.  Ordered their French toast and it was kind of thin and soggy.  No peanut butter inside and it wasn't an option. Free Chinese newspapers with breakfast."}
{"text":"This was my first time here again in about 3 years and I honestly didn't expect much but I was actually very pleased with both food and service.   I ordered the rack of lamb dinner set and my friend ordered the sizzling steak set. You get a very satisfying dinner at a very good cost. The food was not amazing but definitely enjoyable. You get a hot drink, hot bun, sup and mango pudding as part of your set dinner.   I will definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"COCKROACH ALERT! I ordered a bowl of noodles today. There was a small cockroach floating on the soup. Stop going here until they clean their kitchen!"}
{"text":"Lots of negative reviews which was to be expected. The quality of food has been slowly deteriorating (not that it was good to be begin with!) and I noticed they increased the prices on certain items. Despite this, I still feel like they're competitive with their breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea menus. The service is like any another HK style cafe which means they're going for fast efficient service, not politeness. I have never had any problems with their service from the 30 or so times I've visited except for one time when they forgot my lobster order and I had to wait over 20 minutes for it to come. If you're having trouble getting a waiter to notice you, the call button that is on every table may come in handy.   The breakfast has always been decent at a reasonable price. No complaints there.  There are some lunch items which are terrible but if you stick with the basics like any dishes that comes with rice or spaghetti and the fusilli then you're good. Items to avoid are the vermicelli and the steak. The soup that comes with your meal is not the best but I like the bread they give you. They're usually warm and satisfying with the soup. Don't order fancy drinks and stay with the drinks you don't have to pay extra for. The portions are quite large and definitely bigger than average so they have that going for them.  For afternoon tea, I would highly recommend the honey and garlic wings. They have lots of flavour and come steaming hot. If you compare the wings here to a Western restaurant that serves them, you'll find that the price of the wings at Firefly is very reasonable. Avoid the red bean ice cream drink unless you don't like sweet things. They don't put enough ice cream in it so it tastes very watery and not creamy at all. The red beans are bad quality and hard to chew.   I would avoid coming here for dinner because they don't serve anything good (that I've tried) at night. The prices for dinner are significantly higher than lunch. The quality and quantity of the meat and lobster are bad so don't think you're going to get a good deal because the prices seem reasonable for them. The lobster bisque and salad aren't very good either.   If you want big portions of mediocre food for around 10 bucks I would recommend Firefly to you. Otherwise, I would stay away."}
