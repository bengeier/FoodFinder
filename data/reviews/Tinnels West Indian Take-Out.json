{"text":"I ordered 1 dozen patties, and I'm hoping that this was just a bad batch. But as I ate two of the patties I must say that they were mostly patty crust with very little meat. I was extremely dissappointed and would not recommend this place to anyone.
 KMT...I still have 10 more go..."}
{"text":"I've been going to the North York location for years because I love the patties and they're fresher than when you buy them at the Asian supermarkets. 

I didn't realize there was a Brampton location until today, which is more convenient because I live here. However, the service here was very lacking. Mainly because of the lady at the register taking my order. She had a stuck up look when I approached to take my order. I didn't realize they don't accept debit, and that seemed to irritate her even more. I did notice an ATM machine inside the store, but nowhere did I see a sign that said debit wasn't accepted. Anyway, I just really didn't like the attitude of that employee. I almost didn't come back to place the order after heading to the car to grab my wallet and cash. There were other employees there that seemed to be more pleasant, so hopefully if I decide to come back I'll get to deal with them instead. 

Companies need to understand their employees can keep customers coming back or keep them away. In this case, I wouldn't mind getting my patties back in North York whenever I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Tinnels: I gave 5 stars for the patties only. As for as attitudes and lack of meat; lol, lol, doesn't surprise me. There not the first West Indian place to act this way, and they won't be the last. Not everyone is cultured, and has manners or common sense. If I really want oxtail or curry chicken, etc, I will make it myself. That's just me though.!!  Don't know if this helps or relevant, this is just my personal opinion.
P.s I will still by my patties from tinnels! And ignore the bad attitudes and lack of debit machines lol!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating patties I always thought Michadeans where the best .
Until I had these . The meat is just seasond perfect full of flavor.  We always by be a spicy  and bake them at but buy some for the drive home ."}
{"text":"Best patties we ever ate. Meat taste and pastry were the highlights. Other reviewers talk about poor customer service. But who cares, just go in, get your patties, pay and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Funny that I've never reviewed this place, as it is up there as a Brampton mainstay as you can get. I can't claim to be a patty expert, but these are undoubtedly the best ones in Peel and many I know who've visited from Toronto say it's very good. Their main distinction for the patties is they good quality pastry: nice and soft and not the cheap flaky kind. It's nice when combining it with coco bread for a carb delight. A great option is picking up a dozen to bring home for a snack or light meal. 

Everyone knows the service is functional at best, but it is what it is and certainly not trying to be a dining experience. They have started serving regular meals since they moved to this unit a couple years ago. I can't speak to that, and most still come in for the patties as I've observed."}
{"text":"not as good as Randy's patties, but these guys can hold there own...Located in a bad strip plaza, hookers, drugs but beyond that these patties are homemade, a little spice and if served on coco bread, they are great, wash it down with a ting and your all set... Best patty in Brampton...."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Jamaican patties in Brampton, possibly Peel region. It's clean. They do take out, retail and whole sale. But I'd your looking for a ring and a party to hit the spot, this is your joint! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the fuss is all about this joint. I went in there the other day after passing this joint for over an year now on my way for work. 

The inside is very simple and they do mostly patties, and some other West Indian/ Caribbean fair. 

So I got vegetable and chicken patty. Let me day this Jamaican pattys , I expect then to be spicy. The vegetable filling was actually sweet. I could tell they used frozen mixed vegetables out of a bag. It was distasteful. 

The chicken filling was better but too runny and no flavor at all. No heat. 

The crust was OK, it wasn't scrumptious I've had better patties before in BC. And they don't expect debit or credit. Cash only. 

I have a problem with restaurants which accept only cash. You can't do this in this day and age. 

I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fast service and more importantly the patties are awesome. I've been buying them by the case ready to eat. They come out hot and fresh. Be careful when you eat them because they're delicious piping hot. The pastry is nice and flaky and full of flavor. The other great thing is that when you buy the frozen version and take it home and bake the patties, it's just as great... and you can make the pastry as crispy as you want. The only reason why I gave a 4/5 is that I tried to call ahead to pick up 3 dozen patties for a work lunch and they wouldn't take an order. It's first come first serve at the store only. The only orders you could make is if it was a corporate account. Trust me patties are amazing. They also have coco bread and they can make the sandwich for you or you can buy a pack and make your own. Wish they had a cheese option on site so I can add it to the patty and coco bread. This place is jammed at around 11am when they open. There's a high school close by so they flood the place during their break. I found if you come around 11:30 the crowd is not as crazy and then it builds up again after 12 noon. Wish they were open on Sundays. I drive the 20km to get my patty fix. Also their chicken has an awesome curry flavor that's addictive. In the end it's all about the beef patty"}
{"text":"Tinnels is always among the best patties in the GTA 

This is a Jamaican spot so I am not sure why it says Indian, Pakistani on yelp

Patty and Coco bread for $2 is always great and they serve Manish Water on Friday and Saturday which I have to find my way back for if in Brampton on a weekend

I wish they sold these patties in the supermarkets where I live"}
{"text":"The lady at the counter with the short hair is always so grumpy it's almost enough to deter me from going there.  

The patties are pretty good. Meat to pastry ratio is good.  About $13.50 for a dozen.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Allan's Pastry Shop patties at the Peanut Plaza which, in my opinion, they are the best patties in Toronto so I tend not to buy patties anywhere else because it's usually a disappointment.  A friend from work brought in some from Randy's a while back and they were pretty much on par with Allan's but I rarely get out that way.

Anyway, another friend (who also grew up eating Allan's) sent me a blog about the Best Jamaican Patties in Toronto (http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_jamaican_patties_in_toronto/) and I noticed Tinnel's was on the list.  A few weeks later I was at the No Frills at Dundas/ Cawthra and spotted boxes of frozen Tinnel's patties so I thought, what the hell, I'll buy a box.  Alright so we heated them up and they were AMAZING! This prompted us to drive out to Brampton one Saturday morning and buy a dozen (with coco buns).  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give Tinnel's a solid 9/10!  The restaurant itself was very, very clean and the ladies serving us were very polite.  I think the box (with the dozen coco buns) came to $22 or so; it was quite reasonable.  Gave my neighbour and my husband's son some and they (who consider themselves patty connoisseurs) LOVED them - good amount of meat, spicy, soft and tasty pastry and so fresh. 

A few weeks ago, one of our (Jamaican) friends was in the hospital so my husband brought him a dozen and he even said it ranked up there with Allan's.  My two friends (who also visited him) ate them cold and still loved them.

I would continue to return and even order the cocktail size patties for my next party!"}
{"text":"Good patties. Too bad the customer service is nonexistent. Never have I witness two more useless counter people. 
And avoid if you have a shellfish allergy as crust lists it as an ingredient"}
{"text":"Flakey and crispy but that's it, beef taste like sloppy joe meat and customer service is a F- grade

So many better patty places in toronto like Allan's pastry"}
{"text":"Crappy service. It's like I was bothering the staff when I placed an order for 2 boxes of patties. 

I try not to come here but the patties are so damn good. 

I wish it wasn't located here as it is mad sketchy area"}
{"text":"Very good patty. Very authentic. Economical lunch. Staff needs to be more friendly. They also do cocktail patties to order. The last time I was there they only accepted cash. Maybe it has changed since."}
{"text":"Ppl come here for the cheap patties with coco bread. There is no place to wash your hands, or any place to sit and eat, no washroom, but they do have horrible rude service if that is your thing. You ask a question about an item on the menu and it feels like youre pulling teeth. Never again. Patties are hot and fresh and the filling is mostly cornstarch and oil plus some beef pieces."}
