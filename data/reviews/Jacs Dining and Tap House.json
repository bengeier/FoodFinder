{"text":"Walleye, chicken française were ok, but I don't recommend either.  The chicken wasn't very flavorful, sautéed spinach was unimpressive, and the roasted potatoes were starchy and dry.  Overall, pretty disappointing experience.  But the beer was good.  Go for the drinks, not the food."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great service and a creative touch to the menu!"}
{"text":"We ate here with a group of 10 on a Saturday night.  There is not a lot of room to wait for your party even around the bar.  I would not recommend Jac's for large parties.  When we were seated, I would describe it a cramped.  We were so close to another table of 4, we asked them if they wanted to join us.   My wife had her purse on her chair and the waitress asked her to put it on the floor or to hang it somewhere away from where she was sitting.  My wife declined on both requests.  We were able to put it on the back of my chair since that was \"less in the way\".  Their beer selection is just OK, although everything I saw was 6.8% ABV or more.  While appreciate many different types of beer, I would have liked to have seen a lighter selection for the warmer months.  For one person in our party, it took them 3 times to get his drink right and in that process one of his drinks was spilled on my wife.  While they apologized, there was no offer of any kind of restitution or an offer of a complimentary drink.  

Our food order took FOREVER.  It had to be at least a half hour from order to service.  We were seated just after 6:30 and our food arrived just before 8.  I will say that the food was to temperature, but was just \"OK\".  I had the Jac's classic burger and my wife had the Chicken Francaise which she said could have used more sauce.  One of our friends had the Moules et Frites which was a good portion and were good.  Due to the way the table was arranged and the noise, I don't know how the other entrees were.  Also be aware that this item - BACON BLEU BURGER - while listed on their online menu is no longer on the menu when you arrive or at least it wasn't when we went.  It appears to have been replaced by a Cheddar BBQ Burger

We were warned that they do not split checks for groups larger than 6.  But you could give the waitress different credit cards to pay for portions of one check?  This practice is lame.  We get to sit around the table trying to figure out who owes how much and then determine if it will cover the check....blah, blah, blah.  I do not know why this is a practice, but if you are worried about your 18% Gratuity, then just allow the separate checks and state that 18% Gratuity will be added to each check for parties of 6 or more where the checks are separate...Problem Solved.  You have a POS system that will handle this very easily.  It seemed, in our opinion, that this place is run with an attitude of whatever is convenient for \"Jac\" is how we do things.

While others may find a reason to return, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Let's see -- $14 for an okay fish fry (can you believe they serve the cole slaw in a plastic relish container?), no bread unless you fork over another $4, and a room that's so noisy you can barely hear yourself think. Nope, not for me!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, I love the location and neighborhood Jac's is located in, my boyfriend and I went there for our 6 year anniversary and it was PACKED however, not only were we seated in no time at all, we had a great window seat, ordered our food (which was delicious) and was eating within 10 minutes of ordering...being the type of person who looks at time as the most precious thing in this world, this place was on their game! The staff remained friendly which I find incredibly important in the service field and I've been other places where this is not the case so I appreciate all that was done that evening out and we will absolutely be back to Jac's with friends and family for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times since starting school this fall. Food has always been good but they have a couple servers that have terrible attitudes. When it's happened more then once, it's no longer them just having a bad day. They have a great tap selection and drink specials too."}
{"text":"Yes - no stars!!  Are you f**king kidding me??  We waited two hours on a Tuesday night!  Hostess needs to learn how to sit people in a timely manner!  Bad news!!"}
{"text":"Any place that has a dedicated gluten free deep fryer is a five star restaurant in my book. It also helps that the food tastes great and decent portion size. My wife and I went here for the Friday night gluten free fish fry and we can not wait to come back to the Madison area to eat here again. The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. All I need now is a restaurant of this quality and mind set to open up in the Naperville, il area."}
{"text":"Jacs is a good place to hit if you are around Monroe Street.  I've been several times, mostly for dinner but also for brunch.  The menu is pretty standard, with sandwiches, salads, and some entrees like steak frites.  They have great beer choices and you can also get a flight.  Food is usually good, some things have been better than others.  I really liked the frites and the pesto sandwich.  Interior is nice, though not quite as nice as Brasserie V."}
{"text":"Went for a weekend lunch for my first trip. Nice beer selection, but a bit pricey relative to other local prices. E.g., $7 for a pint of beer that would go for $5-6 at other comparable establishments like Alchemy or Brasserie V. I would expect that in Chicago but not Madison.

We got the hummus trio, which was tasty and satisfying. My husband loved the Brewbarb burger so I'm sure he'd give Jacs more stars (in truth I'd award 3.5). I got the roasted root vegetable salad. While it was tasty, and the portion was very generous, many of the veggies weren't cooked enough. Several of the parsnips were so tough I literally could not bite through them. I tried several times. 

I hope to return to jacs and try the flatbreads and frites at some point. Maybe that will solidify a 4-star rating."}
{"text":"The cheese-curds might not be the best in Madison but the house-made quinoa veggie burger was very good and definitely worth a visit particularly for vegetarians."}
{"text":"We like to try local eateries. We often avoid chains to support our small business owners. The food here seems interesting, but falls short. Every thing was bland and lacking a wow factor. A kicker for us was a server dropped several plates and glasses. Accidents happen, but when the glass shatters into my 6 yr old girls' hair, shoes and lap, I expect a sincere apology. Not oops...a sweep up...never to be heard from again. Food...mediocre...service...huge fail. Never even asked if she was ok. Other guests were more concerned. We won't come back."}
{"text":"Have had beers on occasion and been disappointed by the the unreliability of the selection.  Joined friends for dinner to experience the dining and were told shortly after finishing dinner that we had to leave. I quote, \"it's a small place\".  We won't be back for any reason. Suggest another venue to meet friends. Food was mediocre and service sub-par."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, for brunch and dinner, and was both times disappointed. The menu reads great, but the taste does not stand up.  Served runny creme brulee. Maybe I would come back to try again, but it's down on the list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Jac's frequently over the past two years, and each time, we have left raving about the food.  The moules-frites are amazing, and my personally favorite Entree is the Chicken Francaise, but what really keeps us coming back is the Frites & Four--which is their French Fries with four AMAZING dipping sauces.  Go to Jac's, if only for this wonderful experience because you will never find better fries anywhere."}
{"text":"Hurray!  Good food at reasonable prices in a comfortable atmosphere.  The Moules et Frites (with the butter & white wine sauce, NOT the chorizo) are a must.  The crab cake will either be a) the best in town or b) a mushy mayo mess.  Likewise, the steak can really vary in cut and quality.  However, we keep coming back for the great house chardonnay, warm service, and mussels."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Small place. Beautiful bar. Nice atmosphere. The menu seemed to have a wide variety of choices. I really can't say anything negative. Even the event was great."}
{"text":"First time there and I really enjoyed Jacs!  Great food and great selection of craft beers and wine.  Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I had 5pm reservations on a Saturday. We were seated at a cramped table that looked right at the kitchen. I asked the hostess if we could move to one of three open tables near the front window but was told \"No, those are reserved\" I reminded her that we also had reservations but she would not allow it. 
When we left 50 min later, all three tables were still open. Not a great first impression for our initial visit. 

Food was OK, waitress was great."}
{"text":"Delicious (yet pricey) salad. Great selection of Whiskey. Wasn't too busy during lunch hour on a Thursday, not sure if road construction had anything to do with that or not. I will be checking this place out after work hours some day."}
{"text":"What Jacs lacks in space and tables, they make up for in good ole Madison culture, yummy craft cocktails, and a mouth watering menu. In most places I can't stand a cramped wait at the bar for a table, but somehow the drink selection and atmosphere of Jacs makes it ok. 

Once you do eventually get a table, the culinary adventure begins. It may be a bit cliche in Wisconsin, but I do love a good fish fry, and Jacs knocked it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Great for gluten free dining...Almost the entire menu can be made/ modified gluten free."}
{"text":"the best restaurant with gluten free options that ive been to in 8 years as a celiac. go there! you will thank me if you do. sooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Jacs is one of our favorite dinner spots in Madison. My husband loves their Mussels Du Jour. their drink menu is always changing and the drinks never disappoint. Eat at the bar and enjoy the company of the friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"My significant other and I went a few weeks ago on a Friday night for the first time. We were able to call in ahead (since there are no reservations) and time our arrival just right so that we were seated immediately. Seating is a bit limited and cramped, as is the \"waiting area\" for a table--I really thought it was going to be a bigger place. The opening and closing of the front door flows cold air inside on a cool night so be mindful of dress attire.

Beer is a big hit and the waitstaff are more than willing to help you find what you're looking for by making suggestions, elaborating on descriptions, and providing samples.

Coming from WI, it's hard not to be a critic of Friday night fish frys. Well, hands down best fish fry I've ever had! The dedicated fryer for those requiring gluten free is what lured me in, but you can't tell you're eating GF. The GF cod fry (walleye is also available) was golden, crispy, and flaked snow white meat easily. The tartar sauce was excellent and the frites rounded off the meal as a hearty side as well. Frites came with an interesting/strong aoili, but ketchup had to be requested. The coleslaw serving was a bit small and had overall a rather bland taste, but it's creamy consistency is still enjoyable. A small cup of chunky homemade applesauce comes with it and provides just enough sweetness after all the salt and acid. My significant other order the Jacq's burger with frites. Nothing really unique about it other than it was cooked well instead of medium, so I guess be careful when ordering your burger.

Overall, I definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful evening at Jac's last week.  A friend mentioned their killer happy hour so we met for drinks and it turned into a full evening. 

We sat at bar seats and I was most impressed with the cozy atmosphere and excellent service.  Each employee interaction was friendly and genuine. The owner even kindly introduced himself as we left. 

I had a spinach salad to start (I really love that they offer so many options with their salads, small/large, add chicken/salmon).  After a couple craft beers I enjoyed their chorizo-saison preparation of the moules frites.  Don't be shy about the $17 price - the portion was huge and the frites were stacked high for sharing.

Yum. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We love, love, love Jacs. We live down the street and go about once a week. The hosts and servers are always friendly, especially to our preschooler...jackpot! As vegetarians, we always find great menu choices--standouts are the walnut burger, the beet salad, and the sweet potato flatbread. Great local beers and fun, casual ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is good. It's a very small restaurant, so eating in can be crowded. The burgers are great - especially the walnut burger. The brie sandwich is amazing. Awesome fries - great brunches.  Very little the complain about here."}
{"text":"No culinary standouts will likely be found here, but come here for the atmosphere and a drink (beer or wine).

I had a great time here and will be back, but I give my ratings based on the food since that is what I care most about. The frites are good, the sandwiches are all Ok, but there was more ranch than my liking on my salmon blt. 

If you are just looking for a place to come after work though, I would still recommend this place for a drink. It is small and not too loud, with a large bar area and a chalkboard full of good looking beers. Unfortunately I came for lunch and had to return to work."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and great choices! The selection for beer on tap was descent. A nice variety in types. The food can mostly be made gluten free, which is nice. The service is fantastic and helpful.  Our waitress was on top of things and even suggested Friday night fish fry for a later date! 
The food was fabulous and we left full and happy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jac's--  thank you for holding up the reputation on this stretch of Monroe Street.  We all know the Laurel Tavern and Bluephies weren't helping much!  (ok Michael's - thank you too).

I've only been here a couple times, but I've always walked away happy.  I'm not sure how long ago they first opened, but within the last two years I've noticed they've started to work their way into \"Madison's good restaurants\" conversations.  

My most recent experience was for a dinner with my parents.  It was a busy Friday night and we had about a 45 minute wait.  It's a smaller place, and I expected nothing shorter than that.  It's a nice neighborhood --- so we took a walk over to Lake Wingra to kill some time.

I had the Mole Pork Loin.  Mole- the chocolate sauce topping common in some Mexican dishes.   Check out my attached picture.   It was served over some cooked \"matchstick root vegetables\"   I recommend!

My mom really enjoyed her fish fry, my girlfriend got the Moules et frites which were served in a garlic wine pesto type sauce.  Those were very tasty... and the aioli for the frites was great.  My Dad had the brewbarb burger and he was really impressed with the rhubarb ketchup on it.

Overall, we were really happy.  My Dad was really skeptical that the service was going to be lacking due to how busy it was.  Service ended up being excellent.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal at Jac's. I got a Jac's burger done medium well and with my first bite I instantly fell in love. Having the burger on ciabatta bread was a refreshing yet amazing change to the average burger. Also they put their very good aioli sauce on the burger as well as on the side to eat with the frites. The frites were crisp and tasty, with salt and pepper. 

The gluten free option is great at Jac's too! I went with a friend who is gluten intolerant and there were only 3 things on the whole menu that were not available to be gluten free.  She got the grille cheese which was mouth watering. It was filled with caramelized  onions, avocado, peppers, and more! It was great she was very pleased. 

The staff was friendly and the menu provided a wide variety of food, although it was a little pricey (ranging from 4 for appetizers, to 25 for entrees) I thought it was very worth it. I Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"About ten days before I ate the moules et frites at jacs, I ate the same meal less than a football field from the sea in France. My husband and I had the same reaction to the mussels at jacs- they were, hands down, much better than the ones I'd had ten days earlier. 

We also shared the crab cake appetizer, which was the perfect size for two people to split, and was nice and light with plenty of crab flavor coming through instead of too much filler. My husband had the special that night, which was a pork medallion and chipotle mashed potato, and while he doesn't usually enjoy mashed potatoes, he found them delicious. 
Great experience at jacs, would definitely recommend for a nice dinner out or for a mellow place to take visiting in-laws and the like."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast, awesome gluten free options. We liked the breakfast so much we came back for dinner the next night. The restaurant was busy and would have been a pretty long wait. Although the incredible food would have been worth the wait, we were pressed for time, so the hostess was very polite and recommended another option for us. We greatly appreciated the outstanding customer service, and we will definitely be back next time we are in Madison! Thank you Jac's!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch experience during weekend visit to Madison. Casual bar/restaurant environment with quality food. Husband said his burger was \"stupendous,\" and I enjoyed cioppino and salad.  Would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place--my new fave in town!  This restaurant is VERY gluten free friendly!  My fiance needs gluten free food and they were incredibly knowledgable and had a great GF menu.  Their food was so flavorful and reasonably priced.

Happy hour and Monday specials were great--a really great deal on mussels and 1/2 off a bottle of wine.  There's another day of the week where the deal is buy one burger get one free!  

We also loved the fries because they came with a great garlic aioli sauce.  

The atmosphere is a great casual pub style atmosphere.

Our server was incredibly friendly and checked on and recommended various GF items--so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! We drive an hour and a half one way just to eat there sometimes. Love the gluten free options. Try the turkey sandwich - to die for! Only complaint is it's always freezing in there. Otherwise, my favorite!"}
{"text":"I stopped in late this morning for a quick lunch.  This place has a warm, welcoming feel the instant you walk through the doors.  I liked the 1/2 bar, 1/2 dining setup the restaurant offered as well.  I'd imagine it would be a great place to grab an early evening drink with some friend.  

The sign outside piqued my interest in the Fresh Made Soups.  I grabbed the grilled cheese with a cup of the Poblano Pepper and Corn.  The sandwich was incredible... definitely your grown up grilled cheese.  Bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes and a combination of brie and muenster between two perfectly browned slices of thick Texas Toast. The sandwich was on the smaller side, but I prefer that.  I'd rather eat my meal than have to leave with a box.  

The soup left me a little empty.  I was expecting a bit more kick from the poblano and more flavor overal, but it was still good.  I added a bit of salt and pepper and it was more than palatable.  

Overall, not a bad spot.  It's got a very Brasserie V feel to it  that comes through from the modern European vibe both places are trying to portray."}
{"text":"My family and I had the pleasure of dining at Jac's for the first time on Friday night. The restaurant itself is very attractive and has a great atmosphere.
It was busy and the was a pleasant buzz from the patrons having a wonderful time.  I had the cod fish fry  and my Wife had the Taco frites, my 9 year old had chicken nuggets off the kids menu. My Wife and I both had the hard apple cider to drink.

We were seated by the window and enjoyed the view of Monroe st.
Our ciders were delicious and the food arrived in a reasonable time for a busy night ,hot and delicious. My fish was flakey the tarter sauce complimented the fish well. Everyone enjoyed their entrée. 

Then came dessert. We could not decide what to have so we went with all three. All were yummy.

Overall a wonderful time was had, my child found a meal for himself. Adult menu has wonderful choices . Highly recommend this place.

P.S. We also came in for brunch on that Sunday. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"My family ate here tonight for the first time. We were immediately greeted at the door by the owner, George. He introduced himself & welcomed our young children, telling us that Jac's is a family restaurant. We felt right at home. Our server Kate was just as friendly. After we ordered our drinks, she came back to our table telling us George wanted to buy our first round & also our children's meals. In addition he sent out a plate of delicious sauces for our frites, also on the house. The food was delicious, the service was amazing, we will absolutely be back often! A fabulous dining experience."}
{"text":"Love jacs!!!! 

Great beer selection, fantastic happy hour, \"healthy & fresh\" pub food w some local ingredients. Diverse menu to fit most cravings."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant is Jac's. 

To be fair, the pool of restaurants in Madison that I can actually eat at has narrowed considerably of late, due to a diagnosis of Celiac disease. The treatment for Celiac disease is a 100% gluten-free diet for the rest of my life. Unlike someone with a gluten intolerance, I cannot eat at places where there is a significant risk of cross-contamination, so a lot of Madison's \"gluten-free\" menus are not feasible for me, because they are not truly gluten-free.

 I am IN LOVE with Jac's because I feel the risk of gluten cross-contamination is really low, and that makes me feel comfortable to eat there. First of all, they maintain a dedicated fryer for gluten-free fried items. This is essential for me, and is actually, I am finding, quite rare. Additionally, our waitress  was extremely knowledgeable and seemed to take my restriction seriously. Although she was \"pretty sure\" that none of the sauces on the menu contained gluten, she checked the items we ordered, specifically, to reassure me, and seemed happy to do so. Unrelated to gluten, the host was also awesome. We arrived to a bit of a wait, and he allowed us to walk up and down Monroe St. during our 15 minute wait. He called us when our table was ready. That was such a nice touch.

On to the food. The gluten-free menu options at Jac's are extensive. There are several menu items with a tiny \"g\" next to them. In my naivete, I initially assumed the \"g\" denoted menu items that were gluten-free. This seemed more standard, as most places don't offer that many GF (gluten-free) options. Our waitress informed me, however, that the tiny \"g\" denotes only the few menu items that CANNOT be ordered GF! That meant that nearly the entire menu was my Oyster! With so many choices, it took a while  to pick my dish. I finally settled on the GF Tarte Flambe. The Tarte Flambe was a flatbread topped with Jones Farm Bacon, Caramelized Onions, Creme Fraiche, rosemary, and Parmesan Cheese. It tasted heavenly. I can only describe the taste as being the same as the glorious smell of bacon and onions cooking together (plus cheese). It was SO. GOOD. And, the gluten-free crust was thin and crisp, and it had no discernible \"weird\" flavor or texture. We also had gluten-free frites with four amazing gluten free dipping sauces. Everything about it was incredible. 

Although my experience was awesome, I can anticipate it being really hard to get a table at Jac's on a weekend night. We went on a Tuesday at around 7pm, and there was STILL a wait! They don't take reservations on Fridays, which is disappointing. I will definitely dine at Jac's again, and I look forward to writing an updated review at some point."}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere, friends culture, chalkboard On Taps, mahogany bar, tables and walnut wood chairs. Killer omelette du jour, fast expedient service, coffee too, made conversation fun"}
{"text":"Service was great.  The mussels were awesome.  Good beer selection.
Ordered the filet and the pork chops and both were overcooked."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Saturday around 2 and there wasn't any wait. They were still serving brunch so we started with a cinnamon roll. It was amazing! For the meal, I got a turkey sandwich and a side salad. It had a cranberry mayo on it which was very good. My boyfriend got their burger and frites. The burger came with lots of frites so I had some. They were perfectly seasoned. Overall, a great lunch at a cute place."}
{"text":"[SPOILER ALERT: Avoid this place like the plague.]

I'm not a girlie girl, so when I decided to do a girls' brunch--I chose Jacs, given the impression of it as a warm, inviting taphouse. Beer and cheese alongside breakfast? Yes, please.

I've had dinner here a few times, and really loved the veggie walnut burger and frites. The beet salad was pretty tasty, too.

Needless to say, this Sunday I was excited. It had been a busy week at work, but I had made reservations and invited my best girlfriends along for the culinary adventure.

Fail. Fail. Fail.

The food was okay, but my order (a breakfast sandwich, served with potatoes) was served on a plate half full. From the start, I was unimpressed with the presentation. The potatoes were fine, and the sandwich was okay--but I was disappointed with the white texas toast. I wish the bread was whole grain, ciabatta, or something with some extra oomph. 

Halfway through my meal, I couldn't find the waitress to refill my water. I was so parched, and I unpleasantly waited some time for a refill. 

As we were sorting out our checks, a waitress came over saying that we were being loud and vulgar. I was confused, and thought maybe she was mixing us up with another table. We called over the manager, hoping to resolve the situation--but she resorted to continuing the offense and insulting us further, not offering an apology. She railed on us for a few minutes while my friends and I listened in shock. I am completely mind-boggled by this situation--I've NEVER in my life been treated like this at an establishment that I'm paying for goods and services. 

I'm still reeling from the insult. Maybe 10+ years ago, in college, at 1am, it would be fun to be loud and boisterous, and then I could understand some gentle scolding. However, this type of behavior towards our classy, professional group? AT A BAR? 

I hope Jacs handles this manager. You never know what burdens someone carries with them, and I don't know what her struggles are--but this should never have occurred. 

I will not be returning to Jacs, and I'm recommending to everyone I know, as well as you faithful Yelpers, to steer clear. Their service and treatment of patrons is a step away from criminal. Shameful.

By the way, I didn't even get the beer and cheese alongside breakfast. Maybe that's where I went wrong? Sigh."}
{"text":"This place is a revelation for anyone who needs to (or wants to) eat gluten free. I go there with someone who has Celiac and she loves their offerings, especially the Friday fish fry, which I have tried and enjoyed...plus, their non gluten free dishes and craft beers are pretty solid too..."}
{"text":"Jacs has good food. They are clearly a step up from your average restaurant. With that said, I don't go there very often despite living close by. Once you\"ve been there a time or two the honeymoon is over. My last visit was a real disappointment. It took over an hour to get a table despite calling ahead. We were forced to wait in a crowded corner, getting bumped into by other customers and dodging waitstaff. All while just inches away from a poor couple trying to enjoy dinner. The food is good, but not that good. There are plenty of other great places in Madison particularly around the capitol."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night- our second visit, but it had been a while. The frites were great- crispy, well-done, plentiful (actually too many for just two people). We're not beer drinkers, although they have an extensive beer selection. Our cocktails were good, and our waitress was a doll.

Two things keep this a 3-star review; the price point is too high for what it is- my burger was $11.00, and while it was 'fine', it was a couple of dollars overpriced.  The other, and much worse part is that we left stinking of a dive bar with an unvented hood.  You know that smell- it sticks with you all night, in your hair and on your clothes.  Not at all what I had hoped for, and this needs to be remedied, because that will keep us from coming back"}
{"text":"Great place with warm and cozy ambiance + gluten free items. Their burgers are super awesome. Highly suggested for people who want to eat healthy burgers WITHOUT a ton of grease and melted butter."}
{"text":"Best Gluten-Free/regular restaurant in Madison! I have celiac and this is one of the few places i feel completely normal. The Friday night fish fry is incredible! Alt-Brew on tap is the best! Great atmosphere. Cozy and very friendly staff. Feels like a very nice home. I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"officially my favorite spot in madison.

so gluten-friendly, it makes me want to cry. i get to eat bread here-- no more wrapping my burger in lettuce!

the drinks are delicious. i highly recommend the eden's margarita and the mojito. the jacs burger and the citrus chicken sandwich are both yummy. also, the flour-less chocolate cake is great. and finally, the frites are amazing; again, appreciate the gluten-free consciousness, especially in the utilization of a gluten-free fryer (no cross-contamination).

go here and be happy."}
{"text":"Small crowded space, even for weekend brunch. Daily pastry was a chocolate croissant that did not disappoint on our last visit. Breakfast entrees nicely sized, Bloody Marys were a bit weak,"}
{"text":"I ordered a large beet salad and the husb ordered the chicken sandwich. When the food came out, my salad bowl was very dirty on the outside -- covered in goat cheese, dressing, and bits of lettuce that I presumed were left there when they were tossing the salad. The beets were lukewarm and fingerlike -- they just looked gross. I didn't touch them. The taste of my salad was okay, but way too saturated with dressing.

My husband's sandwich was so-so. He neither liked it nor disliked it.

We weren't impressed, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't NOT meet something at jacs if they wanted to go, but I would never initiate a visit there. I don't have much to say except that nothing is particularly memorable or impressive. The food isn't bad and there is a decent beer list. The wait staff was friendly enough. Honestly I draw a blank. Eh."}
{"text":"Mediocrity abounds. Over cooked hamburger and crumbly bun made for an uninspiring meal. The fries stole the show."}
{"text":"The walnut burger with beet ketchup is by far the best thing on the lunch and dinner menu. Jacs always has great beers on tap and plenty of variety in menu offerings. It is well known that folks in the area go for half price happy hour, although tonight we went at 6:15pm (typical happy hour time) and we did not receive happy hour prices. This is the main reason we go prior to 7pm, and will continue to visit regardless of happy hour deals, but this is a nice incentive. Needless to say, we will be back, but we will also select a different spot for post work drinks, since their deals have become unclear."}
{"text":"The fish fry was simply outstanding. Great breading on the cod fish and sides were excellent. One of the best in Madison."}
{"text":"4 STARS for FISH FRY (1 star for HAPPY HOUR)

Good:
The fish fry was unexpectedly great! I got the beer battered, which is a thicker crust that can be VERY heavy and scary. Theirs was heavy and it did NOT taste like beer, but it was still crunchy on the ends, had a decent amount of fish in there, and along with a salty taste, had a hint of vanilla in it, which worked for me (somehow). Two small-medium pieces. 4/5

The baked fish (aka gluten free*) was also one of the best I've had in Madison. It came out warm, MOIST, and covered with some interesting seasoning: BBQ meets cinnamon? It had salt, tang, sweet (in that order). It was different; lovely. 5/5

Everyone (3 other entrees = sandwiches) at the table got frites - I'm curious to everyone else's comments about how awesome they are. They're soggy, burnt french fries to me. The aioli was the better part of that duo. 2/5

Potato pancake - this was actually better. Someone had a heavy hand on the salt, but it was, at least, creative. Maybe some scallions in there too - something green and tasty. And hey! they actually looked like pancakes. There was a applesauce on the side - went well with the pancake, if you like that salty, sweet combo thing. 4/5

Tartar sauce was creative too. I'm usually not a fan, but this one had capers in it and not as tart as typical. More like an aioli + capers. 4/5

Drinks
none, but the beer selection looked like a good variety: ambers, pales, sours, CA, KY, NY, WI.

Bad: 
Holy crap, where is the parking?! Oh wait there isn't any. It's street parking, have fun. 1/5

Happy hour - IS ONLY AT THE BAR?!?!? Well, no drinks for us then. Think of that bill you COULD have had. You lost on that one. You could have been nice and just served us a happy hour at the TABLE, but you didn't. You lost out on at least 2-3 regular priced drinks. Hey Management - Think about customer service, cheat a little, have a TABLE happy hour.  1/5

PS. why are you charging $10 for a drink anyway? This is Madison.

Overall:
I liked the fish fry, hated the parking. I'll go back some day, when a friend begs me.

*gluten free here = people who don't want breading. This didn't look like a real gluten free option for Celiac folks; but hey, call ahead and ask."}
{"text":"A bad lunch:

1. Unfriendly and stubborn waiter.
2. Super fatty/greasy soup (which made us nauseous later on)
3. One of the people in our group wanted to taste the soup before ordering, which irritated the waiter. When the bill came, we were shocked to see that the restaurant charged us $1 for \"tasting the soup\". It was literally a sip of soup in a sample cup. 
4. The soup we ordered came with super tiny piece of bread. We asked for \"two slices of bread\". And, again, to our surprise, they charged us for two ting slices of bread. 
5. The waiter never told us that there is a tasting-the-soup charge or there is a fee for two small pieces of bread!

Shame on this establishment."}
{"text":"I've finally been adventuring out more to the near west side. I admit, I'm an east side kinda gal, but with places like this, I'll have to expand my area when going out. 

I went here for lunch the day after a camping trip to Blue Mounds. My friend and I were coming back into town and decided to stop by somewhere new to us for lunch. We totally smelled of campfire smoke, but no one gave us a hard time about it. It was the weekend and they were serving brunch, but having had pudgy pies earlier that morning I was more in the mood for lunch food. The brunch menu did look good and spying on dishes delivered to those around us, I may have to give it a try sometime. 

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger they had with the frites. I've read about these frites on yelp for ages, and I can confirm that they are quite delicious. My friend had the sage grilled chicken sandwich and she said it was also super tasty. 

The beer selection looked good, but I wasn't drinking this day. I may have to try it sometime when I'm looking for something Belgium. 

My one complaint while there was that the tables are quite close together. If the person at the table next to us had long hair, I fear it would have been sitting on our table edge. If you are someone that likes your space when you are eating, I don't think this would be the place for you."}
{"text":"Vibrant, fun environment, on a Tuesday night no less. Had a 10 minute wait for  a table of 5 at 615pm. Menu is small, but good variety. Some veggie, some seafood, some meat/chicken/pork. Hard to choose. Great beer on tap. The dark Dragon's Milk from Michigan was hearty, with good balance of chocolate, malt and hints of vanilla. Yum!

I enjoyed the moule frites. Fries were hearty and well spiced. Warm and not soggy. Mussels had good garlic flavor with hints of lemon. Well cooked. Not a closed one in the bunch.

Also had the Mediterranean platter appetizer.  Good variety. Tasty carrot spread and decent hummus. Could have used more pita bread.

Service was attentive, although had to ask for a napkin more than once (mine had fallen to the floor). Waitress really knew the menu. Other downside was the two creamy soups on the menu. Always like it when a restaurant offers one non-creamy option for those of us who do not like (or want) a creamy soup.

I M LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING BACK THERE."}
{"text":"Jacs deserves the stars if only for how they ably handled our large group coming in without reservations at the end of the night. The waiter was friendly, attentive, and did a good job of explaining the selection to the group. He also handled check-splitting well, which made the end of the night that much easier. 

Excellent selection of beers, although definitely on the expensive side (nothing on tap under $5). Worth the price, however. The only food we had were the frites, which were a tad overcooked but tasty nonetheless.

Looking forward to coming back with a much smaller group. Very similar to Brasserie V, except a darker ambiance and with more Wisconsin brews on tap."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  With my sister being gluten-free, I've had more than a few meals at Jacs, since their menu specifies only the items that can't be made gluten-free, rather than the usual other way around.  We keep going back, and yet...

The good: the food.  I've had some great meals here, most recently their crab cake Benedict, which was seriously amazing.  Perfectly poached eggs, beautiful crab, even the side of potatoes was delicious (though in need of some salt -- what IS it with under-seasoned food in this state?!).  I also love their chicken Francaise, and I believe they do a good burger.  They even managed to have decent coffee for brunch, which some restaurants just can't seem to handle.

The not-so-good: the service.  My sister called it \"vaguely neglectful,\" and that's the best way I can describe it.  They're perfectly friendly, and subscribe to the \"team\" approach, but I always feel a bit abandoned here.  When I ordered coffee at 10:30 in the morning, our waitress returned to report that they were running low on coffee cups, so it would be a few minutes.  Um...did you break all the cups last night?  Or do you seriously not have enough of your fancy glass mugs with handles to manage a brunch service?  

Plus, they got my sister's side item wrong (easily and quickly corrected, but still), and when we asked for the check, the server dropped it and ran, despite the credit card in my sister's hand.  Finally, the restaurant is SMALL, and it can get quite loud, and the tiny back hallway with the restrooms is awkward to navigate.

Overall, Jacs is not a bad place, and I'm sure I'll continue eating here.  Just keep your service expectations low and you should be good to go."}
{"text":"Jacs has got the atmosphere nailed - love the wood floors, exposed brick walls and tin ceilings. Our server was excellent - friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the  menu.  

We started with an order of cheese curds which carried a $7 price tag. We were both left us going \"wah wah\" when a small plate arrived, the cheese curds barely making up a layer covering the plate. Good thing I'm not too much of a cheese curd lover because this was hardly a Wisconsin portion for two! (I'm from Michigan, forgive me, I don't know any better...)

The draft beer list is extensive and diverse, although it is pricey. Most of the beers are in the $7-8 range.  I certainly understand that fancy beers are often served in a smaller goblet glass, but I do think a menu should (and usually does) indicate this in the description.  Otherwise you get sad thirsty people like me expecting a pint and getting a tulip.  

Moving on!  The food was quite good.  We ordered a large beet salad ($11) to share and our server made the extra effort to have the kitchen split the salad into two servings instead of simply handing us an extra fork & plate.  Kudos!  The butternut squash flatbread was excellent. Don't expect a pizza, this is different, kids!  A thin flatbread smeared with a butternut squash & apple puree, topped with chunks of brie, fresh spinach, red onion, and pepitas.  Let's just say people were jealous at work the next day when they saw my carryout box.

Liked the atmosphere, service was excellent, would skip the curds and opt for a bottle of beer.  That about sums it up."}
{"text":"Jacs...where have you been all my life...ha! Stopped in at Jacs on a recent trip to my alma mater last weekend. This place has changed names a few times since I was in college, but they seem to have found their niche. It claims to be a restaurant AND tap house, and that's true with the amount of beers they have available. Had a couple local brews, my favorite being the scotch ale. The place is small and quaint with friendly service and a menu that is pub grub, with a kick. 

I went with the Salmon BLT and it game on some ciabatta bread and some aioli sauce and the BLT items. Came with the frites that everyone else raves about and they were good! Great flavor and light all around. Perfect for lunch. Nice place for a casual date or to bring family & friends when visiting."}
{"text":"this is our \"close to home\" standby. we love the burgers (especially on the nights when they are buy-one/get-one ala cart), appreciate the great happy hour specials and welcome the regularly changing on-tap selection. we have also tried and liked most of the sandwiches and flat breads on the menu and of course - the frites are always a hit. we've also been for brunch and had great eggs benedict and bloody \"maries\"... if there was a sticking point it would be that service is kind, but can be a bit missing-in-action and/or overworked at times, so it's not always the best choice for a quick bite"}
{"text":"We had such a nice brunch here. Wonderful food. Wonderful service. Great selection. Good prices. A yummy turnover to finish off a lovely meal. Unpretentious and friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Small, wish it was bigger! Food fab! Love that my daughter has options for GF."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend George (an awesome and needy labroador [sp]) in Madison, plus their owners Ann and Paul. First place we went was Jacs, which I'd never actually eaten at before. (Closest occurred last summer when I went with Paul, but then he decided I should try another restaurant, and so we left Jacs and went there and told them we would come back but we didn't.)

Jacs is quality gastropub type food. I had the burger, and it was delicious, just a few notches below Minetta Tavern (gold standard for non-California burgers). Fries were decent, too, and the atmosphere is non-rushed and relaxed. You can take your time. 

I wonder if there is a real Jac who doesn't spell his name with a K or what."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice and the food was fantastic both times. The menus is unique without being over the top where you worry about what you are really ordering. The staff is friendly. 

The only downside is that it is small, so make reservations for dinner. 

Overall a great place to get good food without a stuffy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood eatery that always pleases. We have come for lunch and dinner. They have  an excellent variety of beers but also wine. Their Moule et frittes is a signature dish which I have had often. They do have vegetarian options such as the black bean burger and the walnut burger. The place is small, divided in half between bar area and dining room and has a tendency to be noisy when full. If you're looking for a quiet intimate dinner probably this is not the place to go. However if you live nearby, like me, you'll frequent this place often."}
{"text":"Probably more of a 3.5 star with Jac's but every time I go I'm just a bit more underwhelmed than the last time. I'm a fan, but it's not at the top of my choice list on a Saturday night. That said, you won't likely have a bad meal here. Service has always been attentive and prompt though fairly impersonal. I remember the first time I came was blown away by the cocktail menu (had my first Moscow mule here) and the Jac's burger - the cocktail menu has seemingly shrunk down a bit but is still a good one. This most recent review is about the saltim boccawich (chicken) which was awesome, and the Breakfast in Soho cocktail (or two), which was really good and easy to drink. We came with friends and though we had made reservations I believe we easily could have been accommodated without them at 6 on a Saturday - likely owing to Monroe St construction. Our waitress was super attentive and on point. The cheese curds are better than most.  The aioli with frites was a little on the thick side but the frites will satisfy your salt craving. My sandwich had a really exciting description but to be honest it all seemed to blend together to create a pleasing flavor where none of the descriptors really stood out. I may not have even noticed if that caper aioli or fresh sage was there or not to be frank. 
Give it a try if you haven't."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  And I love the atmosphere.  One of my favorite places in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been to Jac's a total of 3 times. I love the location and neighborhood vibe. That said I keep hoping that I will get a 4 Star feeling from the experience.

The first two times I ate at Jac's I had the mussels. It is hard for me to turn them down. They are well prepared and presented. I had the moules frites on the side and they were OK. I prefer the mussels at Nat Split and can't seem to get them off my mind.

During my most recent visit to Jack's I had a burger and fires. The burger was tasty and cooked to perfection. It was truly medium-rare and quite tasty. My fries were not crispy, which to me is a cardinal sin. I ordered a Dark and Stormy but it was more like a Cloudy with a Chance of Drizzle. It was not very flavorful nor did it pack a punch.

For dessert I had Crème Brule. I think this is a huge misnomer. This was no egg custard. It was more like a pot de crème- a heavy chocolate pudding. Not what I wanted or expected. 

Service was excellent and friendly. These folks really work hard in small space. They deserve a big thank you which means tipping generously.
 
I shall return and try another entrée or a sandwich. I am not done with you yet, Jack."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and this weekend was finally able to do so. It's seriously so good. I can't wait until my next visit. Honestly thank god I don't live within walking distance because I'd be broke.

They don't take reservations, but we called on our way there and the host said he had a table for 2 if we got there within 15 minutes. We did, and sure enough our table was waiting for us (awesome). We started off with a beer and cider for me, and could tell right from the get-go that the service was going to be stellar. And it was throughout our dinner.

We had the almond stuffed dates as an appetizer and they were absolutely phenomenal. Best thing I've eaten in a very long time. We then split the roasted beet salad and pheasant flatbread (gluten free). Both were divine. I was particularly impressed with how yummy the gluten free flatbread was, it was clear that it was homemade. 

The entrees might be a little pricey, but it's so worth it. Best meal I've had in quite some time, and even my mom agreed. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place's happy hour (4-7 50% off drinks). It gets packed but the bartenders are all really great. Staple drink: New Fashion.

Food-wise, the frites are great (you can't go wrong with fries though). Brunch was OK, definitely not my favorite. The rest of the food, I've only tried bits and pieces, but it's all been good. Plus it gets points for looking delicious (as I've noted every time I'm just there for drinks).

Service: Super! All the staff is friendly and accommodating - especially the bartenders.
Environment: Half the place is for dining, the other half is the bar. It's decently sized, but gets packed pretty easily during happy hour - which also makes it a little bit loud. Also, wish they had outdoor seating.

Background: This used to be the Monroe Street Bistro. They changed their menu but kept mostly the same with the drinks."}
{"text":"First time here recently. Great place! Friendly bartender with good recommendations for beer. Terrific happy hour as well. I had the Prosciutto and Peach Flatbread which was easily one of the best flatbreads I've ever had. Will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends on a Friday night...pretty crowded, but even though they don't take reservations, they do let you call ahead.  The host was very nice, checked in with us a couple times to let us know what the status was of our table.  Food was delicious!  Mushroom & butternut squash risotto was absolutely the best--friends fish fries were excellent too.   Only negative was that our waitress did not once ask any of us if we wanted another drink, nor did she refill our water.  Overall though, I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Soooo good... everything I had was delicious! They were also great with my multiple questions and allergies (not everywhere is so nice) I had Malbec wine, mussels, and duck breast with sweet potato mash, kale and spinach, Brussels sprouts, and cranberry chutney. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped off here on a long drive after Christmas and I have nothing but good things to say about both the attention to detail and care taken with handling gluten-free dishes for my wife, who has Celiac disease, and the general quality of the food and beer selection. I had a burger and fries and they were delicious without leaving me feeling over-full or like I had eaten a fat-heavy meal.

The only possible negative, for me, was that arriving in the middle of a seven-hour drive meant I was only able to read, and not sample, the remarkable tap list.

Certainly worth the trip off the freeway; if you actually live in Madison you should come here early and often."}
{"text":"A coworker and I were in town for business and stumbled across Jacs when looking for a gluten free place to eat.  This place was perfect.  Kate, our waitress, was fantastic as well as knowledgeable about GF options.  We started with with bacon wrapped dates, my coworker had the duck over a sweet potato puree/I had the bourbon bacon burger, and we finished with the creme burlee.  Will be back on your next trip out and request Kate every time!"}
{"text":"The beer choices are good, but expensive. I only come here during happy hour. The food is very un-exciting and over-priced. One of the regular bartenders is always nice, and one of them is deeply unpleasant. He is routinely rude, especially if it's happy hour, despite the fact that we've always over-tipped him."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  I made a reservation a week Ago and yet it took 30 min to get our table. The food was descent but for the price, there are better places to eat. Also it's a tap house but the selection of beers is limited. Luckily the company was great and that's what matters most. I probably would rather go to Brasserie V instead. We went here because they take reservations but that didn't do us any good anyway. I really wanted to like it but Jacs but they fell short of my expectations and didn't do anything for not having our reservation ready for 30 min. Not even an apology."}
{"text":"Love Love Love

Roommates and I decided on going somewhere new in Madison, and found Jacs on Yelp, and read how much it was praised. So we decided on giving it a shot. I'm glad we did!

Let me just say, love the area that Jacs is in, gives off kind of a small town feel but obviously in a big city, very cute, and quaint. 

It was decently busy for a Tuesday evening, but we got right in. Our server instantly gave us a warm greeting, and offered us something to drink and read off the specials. We decided on starting off the meal with The Frites as an appetizer with the four dipping sauces ( Classic Aioil, Sage Aioli, Cranberry Mayo...which was my favorite, and the House BBQ. ) After looking over the menu, I decided on getting the Bacon Blu Burger... minus the Bacon.. with a Side Salad with their House Raspberry - Cherry Vinaigrette. The Burger came on a pretzel bun, it paired so well with the cheeder - blu cheese becheme. I will agree with a few of the yelpers that the bun was a bit too big for the actual burger patty. 

The atmosphere at Jacs is great, very cozy, dim lighting, soft music playing, and staff was fantastic. Can't wait to try Jacs out again!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in on our way back from Mineral Point for brunch.  The breakfast tacos (black bean and chorizo) were delicious and so were her farm fresh organic eggs and ham!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!  Tuesday's are 'Burger Night' and you can order off the menu or order the special burger created that day.  The special tonight included Dijon, arugula, and a pretzel bun...very tasty.  Brunch on Saturday is awesome!  Great local beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Loved how all the food was gluten free! Or server was good, and they were also able to accommodate a garlic allergy with ease. I will totally go back again."}
{"text":"Best plastic ever,  fantastic fish, we shared the walleye,  the plated it separately for us, had the bread pudding also fantastic,  great choice of beers and drinks.  Have to come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"visiting madison for the next few days, and I want to take this place home with me.  This place has a great selection of local beers on tap.  Ambience can be described as comfortable and dimly lit.  Everyone just seemed happy.  We ordered light and had the beet salad with a stuffed chicken special which was scrape the plate good.  We also split a side a grilled asparagus which was grilled perfectly with a nice char."}
{"text":"Went here for bunch with a fairly large group on a snowy Sunday morning. We got in around opening so it was pretty empty, but got more crowded as we sat there. I got the classic eggs benedict, which was good...however I will empty what one of the other reviewers said in that the potatoes were a little skimpy. In fact most people's dishes looked a little skimpy - maybe it's because the plates are too big, or maybe it's because the french toast is so dense.

Now maybe because it was empty when we came in and he was happy to see us, the owner offered to buy us a round of drinks - yey! So we all ordered mimosas/bloody marys. However when the bill came....the drinks were decidedly not free. But we didn't make a fuss out of it...with an entree the drinks were only $2. 

Beer menu looks quite interesting - I'll have to come back another time for a beer or two. But if you don't want to drink a really good beer and just want a \"regular\" pale ale or some other micro you'll see most places - well it ain't gonna happen. And that's not a bad thing..."}
{"text":"After a good dinner, while eating desert, we were told to leave as they had another party expected for a reservation in 10 minutes"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Jac's since it opened- I like the nice, neighbor-hoody feel and GF offerings are plusses. I stop in now and then as it's near where I work and on my way home. I'm not a beer drinker, but my friends who are  enjoy the selection.  Jac's biggest flaw is its service - which ranges from mediocre to abysmal. It seems that there are always too few waitstaff on duty for the number of tables, so it's not the fault of the servers, but management for not scheduling properly.  It's annoying to feel like you have to apologize to your server when he/she is obviously inundated! Please get these folks some HELP!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer of Jac's for a few years now. I only have two \"cons\", and lots of \"pros\":

Cons: 
1) The prices are a little high depending on what you order. There are some items that should not cost as much as they do, since the ingredients are basic and they'd be so simple to cook at home. But, I just don't order those items.

2) Bring back the weekend turnovers!!!! I'm sure the cinnamon rolls are great, but those turnovers were AMAZING. 

Pros:
1) Gluten free friendly: my mother and sister both have celiac disease, so we normally go to Jac's when they're in town. Jac's is truly phenomenal for people with Celiac disease. Gluten free bread for sandwich or eggs benedict, gluten free frier  for frites and onion strings, gluten free soups, cider on tap....it's just heaven for those of us dealing with Celiac disease. THANK YOU JAC'S!!!

2) Atmosphere: So cozy, so warm,  relaxed but refined.

3) Drink list: great and unique tap list (which can be hard to find in Madison). Ii usually only order beer so I can't comment on wine or cocktails (bloody mary needs a little work, however). 

4) Food: truly great food. I love so many things on this menu....the warm spinach salad, the mussels, the frites...mmmmm...so great. Just great bistro, comfort food."}
{"text":"So yum! I've been here probably a dozen times, and tried something new each visit, and continue to be impressed! Currently in love with their flatbreads- they make a veggie/balsamic/goat cheese one that is TO DIE, my mouth is actually watering as I type."}
{"text":"As others have stated, this has become one of my favorite spots in Madison.

The happy hour is one of the best, and the specialty drinks are unique, delicious and potent.  Getting them for half price from 4-6 is just icing on the cake.  However, you will have to get there quite early to secure seating in the bar area since the happy hour special is only good in that side of the restaurant.

I have eaten both brunch and dinner at Jac's and have yet to be disappointed.  I have tried a majority of the menu items, but my favorite still remains the mussels.  They are simply the best in town.  It is also great to have several vegetarian and many gluten free options so this location is always an option for those who have more restrictive diets.

Finally, the waitstaff and bartenders are both attentive and friendly regardless of how busy it gets."}
{"text":"Went there again tonight. Absolutely delicious and amazing, as usual, with fabulous drinks. Food was so good I didn't even WANT dessert, which is UNHEARD of. The GF pasta was perfectly cooked and everything was seriously divine. This is the place I go any time I'm feeling down about missing gluten.

Not only that, but as someone whose food options are limited most places--the VAST majority of the menu are things I can eat. There are only 4 items, exactly 4, that can't be made gluten free."}
{"text":"I *love* their Moules et Frites. 5 starts for food...  3 stars for noise and having to wait forever (they don't take reservations).  

Update: I'm done here.  Last two visits were not good. I'm able to forgive a lot when it's just one bad day... but two in a row... something changed.  The broth for the moules was salty and greasy.  The frites were cold and soggy.  Can't recommend them anymore.  Bummed by that. Plus...when I called later to give feedback to the manager,  I was put on hold.  Then they hung up on me when I tried to call back.  

Didn't want to complain... Just give feedback. I own a small business and welcome feedback! Most people just go away...I wanted to help.  Guess they don't need it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Jacs. It's pretty much all gluten free but you wouldn't know based on the taste. The Friday night fish fry is fantastic get the potato pancakes as a side. And save room for flourless chocolate cake. Their cocktails are also strong and good."}
{"text":"Food was great but unfortunately I ordered gluten free and they brought a regular bun and thank god I noticed and asked if this was gf, they had to take back and food that my friend and I had was delicious I had a gluten reaction. I will maybe try one more time but reactions are severe and don't know if I can go through that again."}
{"text":"Overall, Jacs is a very satisfying dining experience. I had the sage chicken sandwich--very flavorful and the ciabatta bread was to die for! And then of course there were the famous frites I'd heard so much about. The frites themselves were good, but what made them delicious was the aioli served with them on the side--amazing! My only complaint is it's a bit cramped. It was quite busy the night we were there, which made it difficult to maneuver through the tables. However, that is no reason not to give this place a shot. The food and atmosphere definitely makes up for it!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I left feeling that I had been duped into taking an old order of cheese curds and shorted on my beer.

 Our waitress was pretty much \"spot on,\" though she did somehow manage to bring my beer and our order of cheese curds out at the same time, which was only about 1 minute after having ordered them...which was great for the beer though left us both wondering about how the cheese curds got done so fast and yet weren't piping hot??

I also have to add that I was suprised to see my beer come out in a small (8-10oz) goblet opposed to a pint. I guess when order a draught beer I expect a full pint unless the menu specifically states it is a smaller size? (luckily we were already expecting the smaller size for the second beer)

As for the food....it was delicious. Beet Salad and Butternut Squash Flatbread were spilt by the two of us. The salad rocked and was appropiately sized. The Flatbread was excellent with an intereesting combination of brie cheese, squash, and a sweet-cranberry dressing.

Sorry Jac's - I cannot say that I will be looking to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday with our friends. We were two couples so the reservation was made for a 4top  with two infants. Jac's accommodated the request and was very nice about children and us lingering although we did eat and drink and be merry upon our most recent visit. I had the mussels and frittes with a roasted beet salad. My bf had the crab cake blt. Our friends had, the smoked salmon blt and the breakfast tacos. We shared a few appetizers. The most memorable was the trio of hummus dips with crudites and pita chips. The mussels were very fresh and the broth in the mussels was heavy on the beer (a good thing) with a nice clean citrusy or herbaceous after taste to it. The frittes served with the mussels were a huge pile not just a handful. Waiter was patient and courteous.. Offered us samples of beers to try and the coffee was always topped of in our mugs and served with cold cream. I'd highly recommend Jac's if you are in that area of town. parking is difficult but it is to be expected."}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE with this place!  the b & b (Token Creek eco inn)  recommends it and SO true!  Gluten free fish fry is fabulous!  We will come here again when in Madison WI! !!!! Great cocktails and Keith found 3 different beers on tap he liked!"}
{"text":"Zesty and flavorful! I wish to frequent this spot again!! On the smallish side, with a lovely ambiance. They get their gluten-free bread from The Silly Yak Bakery & Bread Barn!"}
{"text":"Low key atmosphere with great draught beer and whiskey selection."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot for good drinks, amazing rotating beers and French/American fare. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable plus they are always concocting different mixes or pickled things for unique drinks. One of the few Happy Hour spots on Saturday! Until 6pm. Go early and stay for some great dinner. The duck wings are spectacular."}
{"text":"I love snagging GF sandwiches or even fish fry here! It's one of the best restaurants in Madison. The frites are to die for as are their varied sauces for them."}
{"text":"The waitstaff was rude the first time I visited this restaurant, threatening to kick us out because the whole party was not there yet (about 5 minutes before our reservation was even scheduled for). A bit annoying, but I let it slide because the food was decent enough. Then, my dad had chosen this place for Father's Day this year, so I made a reservation. Today, the day before Father's Day, I receive a voice mail from the restaurant stating, effective yesterday, they decided to close the restaurant for 3 weeks for renovations so they were canceling all reservations. The day before. Absolutely no warning. Completely inappropriate and terrible business practices. I will not be visiting Jac's again."}
{"text":"Can you believe it took me years to get here?  And then it took me multiple visits to review it. 

Love/hate.  First of all, I was not aware that you pretty much need a dinner reservation to eat here. Even if tables are open, they will not seat them all if they are understaffed. This is a good thing but it feels a little bad when you are hungry. They do not have many taps or drinks, so I usually end up not drinking here. The beer selection is always IPA heavy. 

The first time I was there, I sat at the bar. Terrible service. The second time, I sat at a table. Great service. The interior is gorgeous and the place is cozy but somehow fits about 15 tables in the place.

There is no parking lot but I have never had too much of an issue getting street parking. 

Now the food. A little pricey for what it is. Now it is tasty, but mac and cheese was $17. The mac and cheese was a little oily but overall had great taste without being overly cheesy. The ham chunks were really big in the mac. I have also had the Chicken Francese.  This was NOT a traditional variety. It was good but I almost wish they had named it something different. I was expecting something more traditional. It was good. My husband loved it but I would not get it away. The breading was thicker than its traditional counterpart. I could have also used more sauce for the mound of potatoes that came with it. 

I have also had the cheese curds. They were curds."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 to jacs for brunch on Sunday. They have a pretty good brunch menu with many different options. I got the harvest salad which was huge with salmon. The coffee was a bit watery. A friend got a Bloody Mary and said it wasn't very strong. The order of fries is huge!!! Can be shared with five people easily. Good brunch spot in Madison. The only actual complain I have is the waitress. We were with a group of friends and she didn't ask ahead of time if we would be splitting the check. When we asked at the end she looked pissed and was very rude about it while delivering our checks. Waitress's name was kate (that's what the receipt said). We were all pretty offended by her rude behavior to us. All places in Madison split checks no problem.. It's to be expected in a college town."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was terrible, especially for a lunch hour. Took 15 minutes to get a cup of pre-made soup. Again, the food was decent and reasonably priced but man, speed it up around lunch time!"}
{"text":"Jacs was a three star experience for me. I was mostly underwhelmed by the food.

Met up with two other people here and there was a slight wait for a table at around 7:30. The host was really nice and kept updating us on the status of our table. We had some time to enjoy drinks at the bar and they had a nice variety of beer, wine and cocktails.

We were seated relatively quickly and had a great server. Good cheese curds for appetizers. They have two vegetarian burgers on their menu and I had the chick pea/ walnut variation with the beet ketchup. I applaud them for creating a homemade vegetarian burger but it just lacked a lot of flavor. The French fries were also okay. I do believe that the other individuals appeared to enjoy their meals though and based on the other reviews, I probably just ordered the wrong thing.

I would definitely give this place another try. It is a really fun atmosphere and they appear to have good specials everyday."}
{"text":"Hadn't had a chance to get out on Saturday night in a while, but we were finally able to get out a couple of weeks ago.  Needed to be on the Westside of town, so thought we'd hit up Jac's.
Lovely restaurant.  As we didn't decide until late, when I called, they were no longer taking reservations, but I was able to add my name to the list.  When we arrived 45 minutes later, we checked in and found a seat at the bar.  Ordered the New Fashioneds based on a friend's recommendation.  Barely received them, and our table was ready, right in the front window. Perfect.  The drinks were tasty, basically a bourbon old fashioned.
We got the frites appetizer with the selection of aiolis, and burgers and the side salads.
The frites were fantastic, a healthy serving and the sauces each added just enough flavor without overwhelming the tasty frites.  
The burgers were done just right. Her was the Jac's Classic and I had the Bacon Bleu.  Both just hit the spot perfectly.
I also enjoyed a nice IPA, but the name escapes me.  Nice tap list and craft cocktails.  Tasty food and a fun view of Monroe Street.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Come here for expertly hand-cut frites, served perfectly crisp. Splurge and purchase the sauce trio (cranberry mayo, sage aoili, and their house BBQ). Then thank me later.

Jac's is a beautiful restaurant on Monroe St. Like many restaurants in Madison the layout is quite small, but the interior is set up to allow the most possible space for guests. I found it to be very comfortable, intimate and relaxed. My party and I shared a table at the front of the restaurant by the large windows overlooking the street. It was a cozy spot where we were able to people watch and admire the snow blanket the street. It was quite the backdrop.

My party of three entered Jac's at dinner time midweek and were greeted immediately. I don't believe there was much of a wait, however, there is a decent sized bar where one could order a drink if so. Once seated we were met with our waiter who was a real delight. He gave us some recommendations and declared that the Mac & Cheese was probably his favorite dish, and one of my dining mates took his word and ended up ordering it. The Parmesan bread crumbs that were drizzled over the cheesy goodness that is the Mac 'N Cheese gave the dish a nice light crunch, as well as the ham and bacon bits. Although it was highly enjoyed, the price was a little steep at $17.

On the other hand the Jac's Classic burger I ordered was very reasonably priced at $11, as are most of their burgers/sandwiches, but it did taste just 'ok'. I was able to sub my side for a cup of their tomato soup for only a buck up-charge and it was creamy deliciousness that definitely hit the spot. 

Jac's has a lot to offer: Great service, a lovely atmosphere and some great food. They have quite a few options that are decently priced and that sound tasty so I am sure to be wowed in the future."}
{"text":"Yesterday morning, 6 girlfriends got together for their start of weekly brunches. We chose Jac's because we heard wonderful things about the restaurant and despite the fact someone wanted to go to Bluephies, we vetoed her. Little did we know. 

The food was wonderful. 

However as we finished our drinks (water and soda), we continued in our conversation, laughing about how men do not clean as well as women. At this time, we were approached by a waitress who said that. \"She did not want to ask us to leave but if we could keep it down and stop being vulgar because other customers were complaining.\"

We all sat in shock because Jac's is not that large and we could not believe which customers had said something because we never said anything inappropriate and we were not being stared at. 

We called the manager to talk because our wonderful brunch (our bills had been paid already, tips left) was now ruined. The manager was extremely rude and blamed us for ruining the morning for customer.. She never once apologized nor listened to our side. As we got up to leave, another couple got up to leave and said to us, \"We can't believe that happened. That was completely absurd.\" 

Needless to say, 6 girls who spent over $130.00 will not be returning to Jac's. Our service was bad and the manager worse. We thought Jac's be our weekly brunch spot but we will move onward to a better location where people are allowed to laugh and enjoy a morning in good company.

PS I do love their food and have been to Jac's a half dozen times so its a disappointment that I will not return.

PPS I have enjoyed dinner here with a group of 13 and did not have this experience and we were much louder and even sang happy birthday as we jumped up and down. Not sure why this happened but again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the classic and a Hemingway daiquiri. Best burger I've had in a while. Great service. Modest prices. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Jac's is perhaps the most underrated restaurant in Madison. But shhhh don't tell too many people, it's busy enough.

Cocktails: $7-11 and they are great - don't miss the Brooklyn and they make a great Aviation. Bar staff is highly skilled and fun to chat with. About 15 rotating beers on tap. HAPPY HOUR IS HALF OFF DRINKS AND BEER - do not miss this.

Their kitchen pumps out some tasty food and is reasonably priced. Fish fry was really good and I would come back. Their fries are the best in Madison #cantstopwontstop."}
{"text":"Prior to writing this review I had been to Jacs before and wasn't impressed. It was when I was younger, cheaper and less patient.  So I took the girlfriend there on a Tuesday Date Night to see what's crackin these days on Monroe St.

We rolled in at 7pm and every table was spoken for except one, so we were seated right away. Sweeeeet. We each had a craft cocktail with different house infused vodkas.  Her's was a black tea infused vodka with lemoncella, mine a raspberry infused vodka with lemonade and fresh raspberries. Both were great. Mine was better.

My girlfriend had of the mussels with frites. She was smart and asked for all 4 sauces for the frites- sage aioli, BBQ, hot aioli and some other aioli. Her lemon butter Chardonnay mussels were good. Nothing to write home about, but good. I didn't know what to order so I asked the waitress what she is going to eat tonight and without hesitation she said the bourbon burger. That made up my mind. The bourbon burger was a treat. The combination of sweet bourbon aioli with salty bacon and melted muenster cheese was impressive. The flavorful grass fed beef was cooked perfectly to medium rare. Oh it was awesome. I rarely order the same thing twice at a restaurant but I will crave one of these on a hungover Sunday, promise."}
{"text":"We had a great visit to jacs for lunch.  The restaurant is smaller, so I can see this filling up during busy times, but we showed up around 1:30 and had no problem finding a place to park on the street out front and being seated promptly.  There is a nice bar, small seating area, and the atmosphere is casual.  Our server was attentive and friendly.

The menu is varied and has some interesting selections from which to choose, including sandwiches, salads, flatbreads, and a variety of entrees.  I was with a party of 4, including a child, and I need to eat gluten free.  We had no problem meeting all of these needs at jacs - everyone enjoyed their meals.  The kiddo went with the chicken nuggets and frites from the cute \"jacs and jills\" kids menu, which is a coloring sheet, and the hostess provided a huge cup of crayons for her.  

One person enjoyed the Brewbarb Burger with frites, which has an intriguing combination of rhubarb ketchup (they make a lot of neat flavored ketchups in-house), bacon, brie, caramelized onion, and bacon aioli.  He thought it was quite good.  Another opted for the vegetarian friendly offering of the Portabella Sandwich with frites, which featured a combo of balsamic marinade, roasted red pepper, mozzarella, and pesto aioli.  This was much loved too.

The gluten free menu is extensive - it is the entire restaurant menu minus just a few items, as indicated on the regular menu.  This gave me a lot of selection.  I finally settled on the Pulled Pork Sandwich on gluten free bread with frites.  The burgers and sandwiches come with an option of frites or mixed greens salad, but we were apparently all in the mood for frites during our visit, and, indeed, they were delicious - golden and crispy.  My pulled pork sandwich was huge - I could barely finish it.  It is loaded with pulled pork.  The real factor that set this apart from others I've tried is the pickled vegetables.  I loved the tangy tartness with the sweet and salty bbq.

We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Was in town because of my wife had an event. I stoped by, by myself for dinner and drinks to kill some time. Mitch my waiter and the bartender was super helpful for both wine and beer selection and the food was killer. It was busy but the service made me feel welcome even though I was a table of 1! No pressure to leave during the rush and was a fun atmosphere to be in. The muscles are a MUST! I would come back here every time. Best service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Dear Burger Joints of Madison -

I have bad news for you. It comes under the inauspicious name of \"Brewbarb Burger\", which contains the following ingredients: Grilled Pecatonica Valley Farms ground 
beef, rhubarb ketchup, bacon, Brie, caramelized onion, romaine, bacon aioli, all on a ciabatta roll. It is ridiculously great. And it has claimed the title, in this humble restaurant-goer's book, of best damn burger in Madison. It also helps that the fries are delicious, a clear cut above the typical fare served at places like the Old Fashioned (fries at Graze are of similar quality).

I can't even remember what else we've ordered there - the Brewbarb will do that to your mind. It is insane. Brewbarb. BREWBARB!

I was trying to think of something negative to say about this place, and all I could come up with is that I think their signage looks a bit cheesy - the cursive \"Jac's\" just doesn't hae a modern inviting look to it. But that might just be me.

So time to step it up, Dotty's, Graze, Old Fashioned, Marigold, wherever. Though I'm not sure you have a chance. That rhubarb ketchup doesn't grow on trees, and I'm thinking the chefs at Jac's might not be willing to share the recipe.

All the best,
Me"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first trip back to Jac's in approximately two years.  After a 25-minute wait, we were seated at a cozy table in the front window.  
I had the evening's special moules and frites with a mushroom miso broth, that was absolutely delicious.  The moules were fresh and were accompanied with a generous amount of perfectly cooked frites topped with sprinkles of sea salt and served with a side of rich aoli. I had a New Glarus Road Slush Stout with dinner.  Personally, I am not a fan of New Glarus Beers, but this Stout is a new personal favorite.  
My wife had a Jac's Classic Burger with a side of frites.  The burger was described as the best that she has ever had and although her side of frites was delicious, she was left with what seemed like the bottom of the fry bin with only small chunks of potato.  My wife thought it was especially nice that the hostess would call us when our table was ready.  We spent much of our 25-minute wait, walking through Wingra Park and along the lake, as opposed to bumping into other patrons in the limited bar area.  

We'll definitely be back to this establishment, and it won't take another two years."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and staff were awesome during our visit last Friday night. On a whim, my hubby and I decided to stop in for a drink but ended up staying once we looked at the delicious meals being served around us. They were very busy but didn't seem harried...the hostess was accommodating as well. My hubby doesn't like to sit in close proximity with other diners and on a busy night you will rub elbows with I'm sure some great people... so she found 2 great spots at the bar for us to eat and drink. 
Our bartender, Rob, introduced us in a very friendly manner, to his Carolina Reaper Pepper infused vodka and tequila. He shared how he come up with idea while fiddling around with the peppers one night bartending.We will return to this fine place for another very HOT Bloody Mary, which had a great garden of yummy things in it.. I had an amazing Belgian quad beer. It seems like a great place for the locals around Monroe street but we felt right at home being patrons from Monona. My son recommended this place and we're so glad he did. Our burger and pulled pork flatbread were so tasty. The aioli for each was great. 
I had :THE JACS CLASSIC* $12
Grilled Knoche's ground beef, cheddar,
lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions,
classic aioli, hamburger bun with great fries (frites) 
My hubby had : Flatbread- PULLED PORK $17
BBQ sauce, pulled pork, red onion,
cheddar, arugula and red cabbage slaw
We both loved our drinks and meals and will surely return... maybe for brunch on Saturday or Sunday for the chicken special."}
{"text":"Went there for \"brunch\" brunch with my sister on aSataurday morning. A smalll .and quaint place with limited seating but you don't feel crowded. Small bar where one could peek inside the kitchen.  Breakfast items include benedicts or just eggs  and bacon toast and breakfast fries consisting of sweet potatoes as well as regular potatoes. MY poached egg was overlooked  and I gave the note to the cooks. But overall it was a tastey meal.  There are also sandwiches.   Service was attentive and friendly. good prices for quality food."}
{"text":"Good beer list.  Pretty solid food.  Not my go to place but I definitely find myself wondering why I haven't gone to Jacs in a while. 
Hubby and I ordered the short rib appetizer - definitely would order again. (highlight)  
I ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered the steak sandwich special. But nothing to write home about. Steak was a bit over cooked for medium and chicken sandwich is a chicken sandwich. ?
The spicy tequila drink is not that spicy. 
Good for a random Tuesday night pretty quick dinner though!"}
{"text":"What a heaven for the gluten-free (and the normal hungry folks)! Food is solid and the kitchen is really flexible and able to make most things sans gluten. Frites (can be made gluten free) are great and come with 4 dipping sauces that (I think) rotate occasionally. The soups and burgers are solid. The walnut burger in particular is solidly delicious. 

The atmosphere is fine but nothing special. There is one main dining area, which is a little small and open with a door to the outside right in the middle. Depending on where you sit there are occasional cold breezes from the open door or throngs of people standing over you as they wait for a table. Probably best for groups of 4 or fewer. 

Jac's is probably best for some of its special nights, including wine night on Mondays where you can get drinks and apps for not many monies..."}
{"text":"We needed to find a restaurant with gluten free food for our daughter with Celiac. This place was knowledgable on cross contamination and almost everything could be made GF and they have a dedicated fryer. Terrific service & food!"}
{"text":"Wow. I am floored. I arrive a little after 5 for my highly anticipated Gluten Free Fish Fry Friday. My honey is home sick but I really wanted a nice Friday night dins. I get there. It's busy, no seats at the bar, but there are 3 open tables. I ask the hostess for a table for one for dinner. She looks at my apologetically and says she's sorry but she cannot seat me. The dinner tables are meant for parties of 2 or more. I can wait 20 minutes for a bar table that can seat 1. Did I mention there is no seat at the bar to wait? I drove over from the East Side for this! Being gluten free this is my favorite place to eat in Madison. I would estimate my partner and I come here at least once every 3 weeks. We consistently leave 25% tips. This is how they treat single diners! I even had the hostess check with the manager to see if I could be seated in the dining area but it was denied. Un-f&*king-believable!"}
{"text":"I would probably only rate this place a 4 maybe a 4.5 but I will round up because of the gluten free options.  Having a nice place to go that can satisfy people with Celiac's disease and those without is a big bonus.  Their frites are amazing and come with various tasty aiolis.  It is a small place so it can be awkwardly uncomfortable when super busy for both seated tables and those waiting as there isn't much room to prevent hovering.  I have been there for dinner and was impressed by their tap selection and large variety of dining options.  Went to brunch this weekend and lucked out for timing as we had no wait but watched it fill quickly with Iowa/WI fans.  Brunch cocktails are affordable - $4 mimosa!  Service can be interesting we saw a party of 4 come in, wait, get ignored and walk out looking at their phones for a new option.  They were also \"out of the cinnamon roll\" but given the time we were there after opening I think they just hadn't gotten around to prepping them....  I was hoping that I was going to love the crab cake eggs benedict, however, I was definitely underwhelmed by both flavor and texture.  The crab cake was pretty bland and very mushy.   Thankfully I ordered frites as my side so I was decently satisfied. My boyfriend got the classic breakfast and raved about the bacon.  Nice ambiance and in a great location on Monroe St.  Will be back with a friend for gluten free cheese curds!"}
{"text":"This update is to let all of you that since I last wrote this review, every time i've been to Jac's has been stellar. Everything I said before still holds, but I've consistently had some very good meals there. Also, note that this place is very vegetarian (but not quite vegan) friendly. So friendly that they serve up two types of veggie burgers: Quinoa/Black Bean, and Lentil/Walnut (Last I checked anyway, the menu changes frequently, which makes it worth going back to more often). The Quinoa/Black Bean is a bit more tasty, but both are well worth trying. It's probably my favorite spot in town to get American style food for dinner."}
{"text":"Yep, this is the place. Close to home, and excellent, always great service. Last time I went in for my signature and theirs Mussels and frets. The mussels were tough, the waitress took them back and apologized and got me a new bowl of the most tasty, best mussels ever.  Thank you! When good service is hard to come by you all went above and beyond.  I've had some wait staff that were kinda sullen, but always polite and food, well its always top."}
{"text":"Shame on me for my previous one liner review. Deserves a much longer write up.

- No reservations, but can call ahead to get on the list.
- Gets cold if sitting by door or windows when cooler temps. (bring a coat)
- Friendly/helpful waitstaff & bartenders
- Crispy well seasoned frites
- Flatbreads are excellent to share
- Almost also items can be made gluten free
-  All Beer, Wine and Alcohol is 1/2 off during Happy Hours.
                         Monday-Thursday 4pm - 7pm
                         Friday & Saturday 4pm - 6 pm

Have yet to have a bad meal. Food always served piping hot. Staff is attentive. Making sure waters are filled and everything is ok. Bartenders are always making sure no hand is empty.

On one occasion we called about 30 mins ahead cause we were coming from Beaver Dam. So we got on the list and said there was a 30 minutes wait. Then we arrived and actually ended up waiting for additional 45 minutes rather than 10 minutes. Which was totally cause we planned on having drinks too. But then one of us finished their beer before being seated and the next beer and the cheese curds that we had also ordered while waiting they said was on the house for the long wait. Thought that was a nice gesture on their part."}
{"text":"Great little atmosphere, but dinner was not that great. I think when we go back it will be for drinks and apps and from looking at what others were ordering, that might be the way to go."}
{"text":"Really solid little bistro. Fast, friendly, attentive service from our server (she's from Prague and gets extra points for being Czech). Great drink selection. Everything you would expect. Two of us ordered steak frite which came well done for some bizarre reason. Default temp on menu stated the correct medium-rare. Server had correct temp orders to us in a few minutes - fantastic recovery. Will probably split my time between Jacs and Brasserie IV going forward. Both do similar things and have their own pluses and minuses."}
{"text":"Great beers and atmosphere. My smoked salmon blt had a very minimal portion of salmon but was still delicious. At $11 it was reasonably priced with a small side salad.

Also, I like this place bc it's not overly popular and I haven't had to wait for lunch or dinner.

I would visit jacs again. I think it would be a great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Any other gluten free, cheese lovers out there? Have you been envying everyone enjoying their cheese curds? Well, don't be too sad! Jacs has GF cheese curds! To make it better? My party had cheese curds all around town, and said that the GF ones at Jaks were their favorite. Wisconsin needs to up there game now that Jacs has mastered the GF cheese curd. They even have a gluten free night on Wednesdays!

Our whole group left with full tummies of sandwiches and salads. After a lot of cheese curds, I decided to round out my dinner with a beet and goat cheese salad. The beets were earthy and juicy! Yum! Enjoy all that Jacs has to offer."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant with incredible food and superior service...  A quaint atmosphere which is surprising with the bar area located so close.  This is a special place for date night and we enjoy neighborhood.... We should have saved room for desert........  Check it out....and yes, make reservations.... It is always packed."}
{"text":"Jac's is the saving grace of Monroe Street. Delicious, reasonably-priced, traditional Americana food in a well-lit, clean, cozy space that can be described as bar-meets-restaurant. The drinks are fabulous, and the Bloody Mary could be a meal in itself with all of the add-ons. Attentive staff, great atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because I have recently had their fish fry and I have got to say...BEST IN MADISON. I have been looking for a good, traditional fish fry in madison and Jacs hits the nail on the head. The breading is crispy and the fish is nice n flaky on the inside."}
{"text":"Small place - definitely recommend reservations. I watched them turn away at least 4 groups before 5:30pm! (we got there at 4:50pm) Had a filet special and the mac & cheese. Both were wonderful! Interesting beer list, in a good way."}
{"text":"My favorite bloody in Madison.  Jeff is my favorite bar tender in Madison.  This combo makes it my favorite bar in Madison."}
{"text":"Good brunch and good beer selection!

If you like eggs benedict, Jac's brunch menu is basically a bunch of different versions of eggs benedict along with some sweet items like a home made cinnamon roll topped with strawberries and cream. I got the crabcake benedict; it didnt blow me away, but it was still good. The crabcake didnt seemed to have a good amount of crab by volume, so i did not feel ripped off at all.

What was awesome was the frites with the sauce trio. Man, you get a nice big cone of fries with 4 different aolis: house special, herb, spicy, and cranberry. My favorites are the house special and the herb aolis. The fries themselves are fairly crispy with a nice, chewy body. It was such a treat!

I didn't order any beers, but their tap selection was good. There were about 1 beers, and they were all at least solid craft choices. The ones that stuck out to me were Romantic Chemistry by Dogfish Head and a barrel-aged stout from Central Waters.

I'd love to come back for some frites after work with a friend some time!"}
{"text":"I love their bruled grapefruit and cinnamon rolls for brunch. The burgers are delicious and I also love their salads (the brussle sprout salad is my favorite). My daughter always gets the noodles and cheese off the kids menu and it is SO good! I end up eating half of it. There are so many delicious options, not to mention their extensive drink options. My husband likes to try new local beers. This is one of our favorite places to come in Madison."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, the sandwiches always leave me happy. Soups are made in house and for the most part ROCK, best clam chowder I've ever had.  

Great beer, AWESOME happy hour (as far as I can tell they have it everyday and it's HALF OFF EVERYTHING) and tasty specialty drinks.  I had a Wisco Sour ... or three (you have the option of having it served the old traditional way, with an egg white. TRY IT!  Sooooooo good!). Dinner is really great, we usually go on Mondays (half off bottles of wine).  

The entree section is fairly small, but still hard to choose from (and the sandwiches from lunch are still available... it can take me and hour to order, I swear).  From my experience I'd say you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fran... something-or-other (super tasty, rich cream sauce), the Risotto or the Mussels (with a big cone of fries that I NEVER can finish, the sauce is a different story).  LOVE the Peach Flatbreat; we do that with HH all the time, it's new and it better not leave!!  

They have brunch on the weekend, with $2 mimosas (so much better than the Come Back, I'm willing to pay $2 more, plus they are HUGE).  

We don't take our daughter much (because we usually intend to hit up the HH for a while first :)  but when we do they always give her toys to play with and the servers are really nice!  I never feel bad about her squeals because it gets pretty loud anyway :)  I'd say it's child friendly for lunch and an early dinner early in the week, but not so much on the weekends.  Can't really rate the children's menu, since she isn't really eating off of it yet... I think I remember seeing a hummus sandwich option that sounded great.  Over all I'd say it's one of our favorite spots to go!  

Service is always great, we get a \"Cheers\" vibe from the place (the bartenders remembered us from our first visit which I though was really sweet).  

a few tips: weekends are crazy, so is happy hour; get there early and stake claim on some seats at the bar and put your name in for a table if you want to eat in the dining room.  It can get loud... but it's gotten a lot better (they have a metal ceiling, so it's never going to be quiet, lol) happy hour adds to this I think, so if you really want some quiet go later.  GET A CAB!  Seriously, Belgian beer is potent and you really can't have just one (or if you are my husband, just 5 :) not to mention there always seems to be some kind of special going on that sucks me in... we've had to call it in a couple of times... now we just go prepared :)  

OH and even my family from up north found something they liked!"}
{"text":"I went here for a work lunch, not expecting much in the way of vegan options, and it turned out that they had a delicious one! Our server was extremely helpful in asking the kitchen how to modify the lentil and quinoa burger to make it vegan. They offered a roasted red pepper ketchup instead of the aioli, which was delicious! I don't even normally like mushrooms, but they cooked the mushrooms so well, I just wanted to keep eating them! They had a vegan soup of the day when I was there, too, which I had, and it was great. The one thing I wish is that they would mark the vegan options, and add more! That would make me a lot more likely to go back, as I have vegan friends, and we're not interested in going out somewhere that we will all be ordering the same thing."}
{"text":"Jac's, the reincarnation of a couple tries at restaurants in this near-West side Monroe St. space in recent years, does a lot of things right.  These include:

- vibrant, fun and comfortably crowded full-service bar and dining room that lends a neighborhood and low-key vibe to the place 

- an expansive French bistro-style menu with well-executed soups and salads for starters, classics such as moules frites (in your choice of three wine-based baths), entrées such as duck breast - perfectly cooked medium-rare, and an array of delicious side items such as roasted brussels sprouts (if you think you hate them, think again)

- a great lunch menu with an array of sandwiches to tempt any tastebuds. Try the salmon on flatbread with aioli for a real treat.

- nice specials, such as half-off bottles of wine on Monday nights

- a commitment to rustic and local foods that really demonstrate a restaurant's understanding of the particular Madison style that has taken hold in the city's top dining venues


My criticisms are few:

- the prices are high: entrées come close to, match and even surpass some of the city's more ambitious eateries. This is an issue at Jac's, because the food is very good in almost all cases but...

- ...the ambiance is lacking.  The serviceable but uninspired décor is a letdown, particularly when such effort has gone into crafting a French bistro or gastropub-style menu

- the Friday night fish fry is a major disappointment; it's not particularly cheap and the fish lacks flavor.  The Laurel just next door does a much better job.

Jac's is a restaurant with a loyal following and a great deal of potential to attract an even larger fanbase.  To do so, a revamping of the dining room to match the ambitious menu, a honing of the overly expansive menu, and a check-in with what some other restaurants are doing, a bit more successfully (e.g. Sardine), would really bump Jac's up into the next echelon of Madison staples where it seems to want to be.  Alternately, Jac's could consider slightly lowering their prices to better match the décor and casual service, and things would feel a bit more correctly aligned.  

Bottom line: a promising spot with good bistro-style food, but needs some polish and attention to detail to become a true contender."}
{"text":"As I'm writing this, I'm sitting at my coffee table eating my leftovers from Jacs last night. (Um, Yum!) My boyfriend and I had a date night and for some reason I was hard-core craving a turkey sandwich... so, of course we went to the restaurant that serves the best turkey sandwich in Madison, Jacs! 

I've been to Jacs multiple times over the past five years and I've never been disappointed. It's a small restaurant located on Monroe Street, although, there's usually a never a wait and parking is always abundant. It has a cozy intimate vibe. In the winter make sure you sit away from the door because it can get a little chilly. In the summer make sure you walk down to Lake Wingra and watch the sunset after grabbing a bite to eat. 

Just a heads up-- the current menu online is different from the menu that they offer in the restaurant. My boyfriend was a little disappointed that menu item he had picked out online was no longer being offered in the restaurant. Nonetheless, he was able to find a chicken and prosciutto sandwich that he absolutely loved. My go to drink is a margarita, which is not listed on their drink menu,  but was still deliciously mixed up by the bar tender... Over the summer I was able to have a tasty cocktail with an edible flower floating in it (check out the posted picture!) 

Not the best for large parties but great for a date night or a dinner with friends. Definitely check out Jacs, and order my go-to turkey sandwich!"}
{"text":"The food is ok though I waited 25 minutes for a salad during lunch and the restaurant was almost empty. The customer service is non existent.  Recently fell in the restaurant due to food on the floor.  The manager laughed.  The owner promised me her insurance company would contact me and that she would send me a gift certificate. SHE DID NOTHING.  Never called me back, never contacted me.  SHAME on them.  DON'T GO."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers although can be inconsistent. Fries were too greasy. Acoustics in this place are bad though, and also sitting close to the door (which is easy to do since the place is crowded) you can stay chilled if it's cold outside and the door keeps opening. That's not a comfortable or fun atmosphere. You can keep your coat on but that's not comfortable either."}
{"text":"I can sum up my dinner experience as bland, with the exception of the frites, which were very good.
I ordered an appetizer of frites with aioli, which for $4 was a good deal because it was a huge serving. They were nicely seasoned with coarse salt and seasoning (black pepper? Not sure)

 I ordered the tofu sandwich with side salad.  Side salad included greens, grape tomatoes, and red onion.  This was fine, although the vinagrette dressing was very bland, tasting mostly of olive oil.  As for the tofu sandwich, it was not good.  It was a slab of breaded pan-fried tofu.  So...it was basically like eating a slab of plain tofu.  There was some pesto aioli but it was barely noticeable. As for my companions burger, it was fine, but nothing special (the burger patty was of a nice size at least).  During our time there, our water was never refilled--we didn't get quite to the bottom of our glasses, but close.  Overall, meh--I'm not returning to this place except maybe if I wanted a beer and some frites.  Go to Brasserie V on Monroe instead."}
{"text":"After spending hours browsing Yelp for somewhere new to try, I decided on Jacs because it's just down the street from my work (and somehow I'd never noticed it?) My favorite thing about Madison is its plethora of \"New American\" restaurants/gastropubs with simple menus and amazing french fries. Jacs is just that.

My boyfriend and I called when we were about 15 minutes away and asked to put our name on the list. When we walked in, it was packed--really no room to even stand and wait--but thankfully our name was called after about a minute! Unfortunately, our table was right next to the bar and there was a large party waiting to be seated. They weren't seated for 15 - 20 min so it was a bit unpleasantly crowded for us.

I ordered the Bourbon Burger and it was delicious. My only complaint is that the ciabatta roll was too big for the patty so I had to take several bites in to actually get to the meat. I ordered the frites, and they were weirdly short but the house aioli was INCREDIBLE. I need a recipe asap.

My boyfriend got the steak frites (note: if someone in your party is ordering this, you should probably opt to get a salad instead of frites of your own. HUGE portion.) I had never liked steak...until last night. I had a couple bites of his and it was incredibly tender and the sauce was amazing. Totally worth the price.

Our waiter wasn't super friendly, but he was efficient, which I appreciate (no long wait for drinks or the check!)

I will definitely be back. Cozy atmosphere, delicious aioli, great selection of beers on tap! Go early or call ahead, it's a small space and can get very crowded."}
{"text":"I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO EAT OUT.

I'm back for EPIC, and as a new Celiac, I was worried about not being able to eat out at all with my coworkers. Alas, I found Jacs through both Yelp and Find Me Gluten Free, and they delivered more than I could have expected. It was smaller than I thought based on pictures, but very cozy and the waitress was awesome. 

Food was good, first of all. The cheese curds were not heavy or very oily, and the dip it came with was really yummy. This was very easy to share with my coworker. I think this was automatically GF?

Serving sizes were big. Even though we got small salads, they were huge! Lots of cheese curds, lotta salad, big main dish, and even a big creme brulee! Ffffffff.

Lastly, I didn't have to explain at all about my Celiac/allergy, which made me very, very, very happy. This is my biggest gripe with eating out. It's been over 24 hours and I have not had a reaction, so I feel safe to say that this is Celiac friendly.

Whenever I come back for training in the future, I plan on coming here. Continue being awesome!

(Pictures coming later)"}
{"text":"My friend and I met here for dinner.  We both ordered burgers and were sad to find out they don't have pretzel buns anymore.  The burgers were pretty good, but the highlight for me was the fries!  I'll be back for those fries alone!  I also had the bloody mary made with dragon's milk beer.  It was really good and filled with lots of toppings!"}
{"text":"It helps that this place is two blocks from my apartment.
The bartenders make excellent cocktails, my personal favorites being the Brooklyn and the New Fashioned. They also serve a wide variety of belgian beers that go along very well with the frites.

Stop in for the happy hour 4-7pm for 1/2 off all of their drinks. I go once a week if I'm in town. It's a small place, so it tends to get packed.

Have only eaten there once  and had polenta which was  quite good. I love the atmosphere and the bar, but I also hope to stop in more for the food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the frites were great but we expected the meals to be more flavorful and we found the drinks to be overpriced. More welcoming to kids than many similar restautants."}
{"text":"Pretty decent walleye fish fry, excellent clam chowder, good burgers, good fries. My aunt swears by the smoked salmon blt. Only real complaint I have is that they seem to use a lot of gluten free buns for their daily specials, which, in fact, tastes like cardboard."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Solid food. Will definitely go back. Especially appreciate their attempt to lower the noise level by adding panels to the tin ceiling. Probably need to add some to the walls. No one in our party had eaten here before. Everyone enjoyed the experience. Beer choices were also great."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and consistent.  Great beer selection.  Fries are amazing.  Burger is small but tasty.  Catch of the day never disappoints.  Highly recommend this place for a casual dinner and brunch.  AND they have gluten free fish and chips...WHAT!?!?!  They fry gluten-free in a separate fryer."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Very bland food. Small portions and over priced."}
{"text":"We stopped by for happy hour. The bloody marys were average at best. The bartender was an exquisite jerk. Rude, negligent, and brusque, he charged us full price for our drinks, and after we pointed out that it was happy hour, he stated \"oh yeah, the only reason you're here.\" 

We didn't eat anything, so I'd feel bad totally slamming the place, but man, get your service mentality together guys. That was just bad."}
{"text":"We went out to Jacs to give it a try and I found a truly welcoming little spot along the specialized storefronts and restaurants of Monroe Street.  While the place bills itself as European-inspired, I found instead a comfy locavore place that was a little upscale, but not immensely overpriced and certainly enjoyable. 

The highlight? Their cheese plate: it featured four bits of local cow, goat or raw milk cheese and -- wait for it -- a \"snit\" of New Glarus beer. On the platter. 

This is what I love about Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) outstanding gluten free selection
2) cute location
3) wide variety of menu items

I can't believe that as someone with celiac disease it has taken me this long to come to Jacs! 

The great location on Monroe St. With a free parking lot makes this a hassle free outing. The ambience is cute, pub like and the service is about average but not bad.

What really makes Jacs stand out is the unique menu options and massive gluten free menu! The cuisine is American. You can get sandwiches, pizza, pasta, burgers etc. Jacs has gluten free pizza crust AND buns AND pasta AND a separate fryer. I only saw one thing on the entire menu that Jacs said they couldn't modify to be gluten free. We tried the frites with the dipping sauces (including a sage and a cranberry sauce) as an appetizer. I had the gluten free Mac and cheese with bacon and ham (so bad for you I'm sure, but so good!). Both items I tried were great and everyone I was with enjoyed their meals. 

I will absolutely be returning to try some of the other entrees!"}
{"text":"met some friends here for dinner last night. a reservation had been made, but it still somehow took us 30 minutes to be seated. (strike one.)

this place is tiny... if you're waiting for a table, there's really nowhere to go that isn't in the way of the hostess and waitstaff. hooray for standing by the door on a cold, rainy night! (strike two.) 

then there's the crowd. these waspy, snotty yuppies are why i rarely venture to monroe street. they make my skin crawl. it's like they all stepped out of the pages of a j crew catalog. barf.

we were FINALLY seated, and things were great after that. the server was pleasant and timely for the most part. the beer list is small-ish but solid. i ordered the mac and cheese and it was really, really good... probably the best i've had in a restaurant (although the bacon didn't hurt). i felt like the prices were a bit steep, but overall we were all very happy with what we ordered. i would give jacs four stars for the food, but the reservation snafu and the no waiting area thing didn't make for a great first impression."}
{"text":"I came here last week to grab a beer with friends. Love the selection of beers. I can see my husband and I coming back for some brews. If you consider yourself a \"beer snob\" then you'll love what they offer. If you're looking for Miller, Coors and those are your staples, you won't find them here. 

Also have nice nightly specials. The night that I stopped in was 2-1 burger night. I didn't order food, but other's plates looked very appetizing. Prices are a little high for what I'm comfortable with, but if the special works for you, it's a good value. Beer is priced well.

Atmosphere is nice and cozy, waitstaff is friendly and courteous. 

All in all, I will definitely be going to jacs again. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it here! Made a reservation for 3 people which I definitely recommend - it's a very small place and was busy at 7:45pm on a Monday night (which also causes it to get a bit loud). We had great service. The beer selection is excellent but a little pricey. I had the Sage Chicken sandwich with frites. It was very good but nothing absolutely spectacular. Overall a good experience and I would go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent mussels and fish fry. Our only complaint was that we weren't told there was an up charge for the walleye."}
{"text":"Kind of an awkward environment when busy because there is no space to wake, and people are forced to stand in front of the door hovering over adjacent tables. Beer is overpriced for Madison. Food is good but nothing special, just basic American bar fare made a bit fancier."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great here (especially for lunch) the service is amazing! My friend and I come here for lunch once a month and now the waitress knows us and is so sweet. Their clam chowder on Fridays is AMAZING! So is the Friday special the walleye sandwich. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their menu options give gluten free eaters a large variety of food. The french fries were amazing as well as the gluten free breads used. This is the perfect place for those looking for a restaurant that understands gluten free needs."}
{"text":"As you get nearer, the aroma of delicious grilled and charred beef meets your nose in a whirlwind of sensory overload that forces you through the doors of jacs. Do not fight this sensation.

This may have (definitely was) one of the best meals on a recent trip to Madison. The jacs classic burger was outstanding. The juicy grass-fed cow, sweet caramelized onions, and sourdough burger bun in particular were the stars of the show. It's a large burger, and my wife and I easily split it. We got the salad instead of frites, and it was a great accompaniment to the burger. We did try someone else's frites, and those were also delicious, though with the burger it'd be a heavy meal.

I would definitely return, and though I'd love to try the walnut burger, I don't know if I could tear myself away from getting another classic. Don't be a nincompoop, get it medium-rare for supreme juiciness. Why can't all burgers be that good?"}
{"text":"This is my absolutely favorite place to eat/drink. I have to eat gluten-free for medical reasons, and Jacs has hands-down the best gluten-free fish fry, plus the only gluten-free cheese curds in Madison. They also offer a variety of gluten-free beers/ciders, but I usually get their barrel-aged Manhattan; it's the best!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to make of Jacs. For starters, the place is VERY small so I would advice to make reservations if you're looking to dine on a weekend. That being said, you have no arm room between you and other diners. It's hard to hold a conversation with your group because the noise travels and makes the place extremely loud. 

I think my boyfriend and I came on a down day. We decided to have dinner there and called ahead to reserve a table. Not even 15 minutes after being there, a group of 10 comes in and basically takes over the bar. They were very loud, obnoxious and rude in some instances. Our table was less than 10 feet away from the bar so we were beyond annoyed at their behavior as well as other customers. Not fault of Jacs establishment . The Bartender had to ask them to please settle down. It really made the experience go downhill fast. 

As for the food, we started off with the frites with Aoli. Not bad. Fries were homemade as well as the sauce. However, they hardly gave us enough Aoli for the large amount of fries we received but still, it was a good starter. 

My boyfriend ordered a jacs burger with a side of clam chowder. The chowder was good. Tasted homemade. He seemed to enjoy it. I got the Mac n Cheese but subbed out the pork for chicken. It wasn't bad but it was soooooooooo  darn cheesy I couldn't eat it! I love cheese but the dish was just overwhelmed with it tall that it was impossible for me to eat more than 6-7 bites. 

The next day, I heated up the leftovers for lunch and could not believe how much oil was at the bottom of the the bowl. About a good 5 tablespoons was sitting under the noddles. I am assuming this was the fat that came from the cheese. 

Honestly, 2 people really could share the dish because it's a lot for one person to eat.


I'm reluctant to say anything bad about Jacs because I feel like I can give them another chance. They were far from bad but I expected better based on the reviews I read on Yelp. I will probably dine there again but I'm not dying to get back anytime soon.

Rating? TBD..."}
{"text":"Frites, bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates and beer list were excellent. Cheese curds were 2nd only to the Old Fashioned.  Some work on cocktail execution and ironing out kinks with seating would push it over the top! Great addition to the Madison restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"First review on Yelp so I'll try and make short and sweet. Frites are the best!! Start out with them as an app and enjoy the delicious sauces. Really good revolving tap list and can't go wrong with local brews.  Very small local so may be a wait if you do not have reservations. Good gluten free and veggie options as well."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it's small inside and it was crowded and very noisy. It was a Saturday night, so I would think a week night would be different."}
{"text":"A dim restaurant meets bar feel. The ambiance reminds me a lot of Brasserie V. I really like that the menu is interesting and different without being over the top. For example, the three little pigs sandwich has swiss, bacon, ham and pork belly on it - something simple but with a funky twist. The cheese curds weren't the best I've had but they were definitely good. The only thing I didn't like was my soup (a pumpkin/tomato something).

I didn't love everything I tried but really liked a lot of it and am excited to go back and try more from this interesting menu!"}
{"text":"WTF? They used to make great fries here and now all they have is deep fried  diced potatoes Gross! Get it together Jac's there are too many good restaurants in Madison to phone it in on a Friday night."}
{"text":"There are multiple reasons for which I could highly recommend Jacs, but the most significant would easily be the gluten-free friendliness. The menu is largely gluten-free or available as gluten-free and the staff is very understanding as well. They even offer a gluten-free fish fry and New England Clam Chowder on Fridays. While not traditional, both are tasty. My wife and I can't wait to go back. If it helps, the drinks are great, too!"}
{"text":"Frites are perfectly fried and well seasoned. Had the roasted beet salad and would highly recommend. The large portion was a generous amount and ingredients were fresh and incredibly flavorful. Add a ginger soda and you're set for a light lunch. Also, comes with four slices of baguette."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times were about equally satisfying! I like their expansive menu, the service, and the ambiance of the restaurant. However, the food is really just slightly above average.

A fantastic place for people with Celiac disease, they can make every single item on their menu gluten-free! This was a huge treat for one of my friends who has Celiac.

Back to the food...I tried their Friday fish fry and it was...alright. Large portions, but nothing to write home about. I tried their seared duck the second time I went, which was delicious, but a fairly small portion and relatively expensive ($21). Their cheese curds are also about just average.

This place does NOT take reservations, but you can call ~20 minutes ahead and they'll put your name down. Keep in mind that they require your full party to be there in order to get seated, though.

I want to like this place more, but between the long wait we usually end up having, and the barely above-average food, I don't see myself coming here too often. It's also fairly small so I wouldn't bring parties of larger than 6 here! If you're in the area and looking for an upscale-ish restaurant, I would check this place out, but there are definitely better alternatives."}
{"text":"Craving french fries but have gluten allergies? No fear at Jacs! A designated gluten-free fryer and gluten-free menu add up to a delicious meal. Be sure to try the assorted ailois with the fries!"}
{"text":"First time for me at Jac's. Over the years, I've heard rave reviews from friends about this place. We arrived a little before 5 on a Thursday night and were asked if we had a reservation (for a table of 3). We didn't, and they were able to seat us right away. Only 2 other tables were sat at this point. Within 30 minutes, the restaurant was pretty packed as it doesn't seat too many. We were seated right next to the door, which is not that great when it's cold outside. Two of three of us were blasted with wintry freezing air every time the door opened (not great). One of my dining companions had to put a winter jacket back on to remain somewhat comfortable to dine (he was also getting bumped into my people coming in and out of the restaurant). My salmon sandwich was ok. The salmon was overcooked, but the selection of items on it were tasty (choice of white or wheat bread). The frites were tasty on the side (your choice of frites or salad on the side). They serve a special house sauce for the frites. My companion had to ask for ketchup for his burger. I'm not sure if we'll be back. We all stated that the food was ok, but not earth shattering delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, perfect atmosphere for a casual drink or lunch/dinner.  I'm really looking forward to going here again soon.

We tried the moules et frites, the garlic and chardonnay variety. Delicious and a meal in itself. My significant other had the pulled pork sandwich which is served on ciabatta that accompanied and held the pork and bbq. The bbq had great flavor without  taking over the pork.  

I went with the smoked salmon BLT and was delighted. I can't believe I never thought of that before.  When I go back again it will be hard to not order it again.  

The frites that are served with the moules are huge and very good. They also had two soups, one lemon chickpea, the other a southwestern chowder.  So, not your typical soup options either. I love places like this!"}
{"text":"Very good place. In addition to top notch typical pub food, they have an excellent selection of gluten free options, both for food and drink. This sets jacs apart from other similar places. Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Best fries anywhere!  Real Belgian style fries with aioli, excellent burgers with interesting tap beer selections.  A great neighborhood bar that doesn't try to do too much- it just has great food, beer, and service for a reasonable price.  Brunch is also excellent and ALMOST EVERYTHING can be served gluten free so I can dine with my Celiac friends.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite places in Madison- I think this place is very underrated. The ambiance is nothing fancy but everything I've had to eat here has been absolutely delicious including some really good cocktails. The fries with the dipping sauces are to die for!! The duck and burgers are also good. The waitstaff has always also been amazing. It's really hard to come up with something negative about this place."}
{"text":"I liked Jacs from the moment I walked in - the decor was warm and unpretentious, yet still feels like a nice restaurant. It *almost* made me feel like I was in a restaurant in a city bigger than Madison. The bar deserved 4.5 stars. The Belgian beers, on tap or by the bottle, are wonderful - although I would prefer if they could keep their tap beers at varying temperatures, since my Belgian was a bit colder than it should have been. That's not really something to complain about, as it's perfectly lovely to sit at the bar and wait for it to warm up. The mixed drink list (using some word play, and not obnoxiously) and wines seemed well thought out and down to earth - I'm looking forward to ordering a martini on my next visit.

The food was good, but somewhere closer to 3 stars. We started with the pear and brie flatbread, and enjoyed it quite a bit. It has a cardamom honey drizzled on it that you notice, but doesn't overwhelm the dish. The frites are, indeed, wonderful. Eat them quickly, because they lose their flavor and texture upon cooling more than most french fries I've eaten (yes, I know - who wants to eat cold fries? but as I eat and talk, I don't want them to depreciate so quickly). My tofu sandwich had excellent texture, but was a bit blah. I had hoped they would have marinated the tofu. My husband had the portabello sandwich, which was truly good, but wasn't up to the standards that the decor and drinks set us up to expect. The quality does match the prices -  our sandwiches came with frites or other sides, and cost $9.

I'll definitely return here. Especially for the beer."}
{"text":"Yeah doggie, doggie. This is what I'm talking 'bout Madison. 

Food. Service. Atmosphere. 
Check. Check. Check. 

I had the opportunity to whisk Elites Bob S and Scrantz outta their home while they are without kitchen and met them down the street for my first jac attack. I dug it. Lots. First off without even asking the waitress let me know I could try any beer I wanted (it's like she saw the indecisiveness coming outta my pores). She grabbed a taste of Oso;s Hop Whoopin' which on tap is pretty spectacular. Not as hoppy as I thought (score, as I'm just learning to embrace bitter... I'm a naturally cheery person) with grapefruit notes (my fave of the round citrus). 

For din din I went with the fried cod (3rd week in a row I've had fish fry) and I have to tell you, it was one of the best I've had. For frozen, battered deep fried cod, it was pretty darn flaky. You can get potatoes pancakes alongside but I opted for frites and I'm glad I did. They're seasoned really nicely and served hot... like frites should be. (If you get the Mussels which Bob did, frites are served in this cornucopia like contraption that makes it look like they go on for daaaaaaays. Easy sharing!) Scrantz had a roasted veggie salad with an amazing smoked salmon atop. So much smoky flavor in the bite she shared with me. 

All in all I was quite pleased with my first trip and can't wait to go back to try more of the menu. (It's probably no coincidence that my favorite restaurant in Tucson... old stomping grounds... is Jax!)"}
{"text":"Brave the construction and  park on the side street and enter a world of amazing flavors!! Tonight my friend and I had the Brussel Sprout Salad. Yum. (The Beet Salad used to be my favorite but not anymore!!) The seafood special was Mahi-mahi with teriyaki glaze, green beans (al dante) and garlic mashed potatoes. OMG!!! Everything was so delicious!! I love this place!  We then topped it off with lime coconut sorbet. A perfect finale."}
{"text":"In a town with so many options, you're not missing much if you skip jacs.  Their beer list is extensive, but that's not saying much in Madison.  I've been twice; once for beers, and once for brunch.

Beers: bottom line, sit at the bar if you want service.  If you're on the other side of the restaurant, you might as well be invisible.  jacs appears to be one of those places where the busier they are, the more likely you are to be taken care of; it's fine for waitstaff to be chatty with the bartenders, of course, but not at the expensive of obviously-waiting customers.  If your brew of choice isn't on tap or on special, be prepared to pay more for a bottle there than you would in most other places.

Saturday brunch: a better experience, over all. Entree pricing is in line with what you might expect elsewhere, and nicely enough, the first bloody mary, screwdriver, or mimosa you order with a brunch entree is $2.  Stick with the mimosa in this case; those received positive reviews, whereas my bloody mary was a disaster of a drink.  The mix is made in-house but is neither spicy nor interesting, but could have been saved if it hadn't been for the lethal layer of vodka floating on top.  Garnished with a lemon slice,a pickle, and a pimiento-stuffed olive and served in a small cocktail glass, this is truly an amateurish effort, and not even worth the $2 addition to the meal.

The food also received mixed reviews; I enjoyed the eggs benedict (the portion of ham served in this dish is both delicious and generous) and the herbed potatoes were quite tasty.  The crepes my friend had were disappointing; she said she can make better.

After a couple tries, I'm done with jacs.  I was surprised to see that they've been open since 2009; the place has a nice ambience but the service, the beverages, and the food all come with the feeling of a restaurant that has very recently opened and is still working out the kinks.  There are better places on Monroe Street and within a couple miles of this place; it's not bad, but you can do far better."}
{"text":"Better food elsewhere.  Nothing was a stand-out.  Tried the cheesecurds...just ok.  Nothing special.  The burger and the turkey sandwich were both just ok.  Both were somewhat flavorless.  The frites were also just ok.

Service was fine and the atmosphere was good.  But, I go for the food and nothing I tasted would draw me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really like Jacs for many reasons, but mostly for the gluten free fries cheese curds.  I have eaten here many times and my celiac family members have never been sick.  They have great cocktails and interesting beers on tap.  My only wish is that they had some more basic food items on their main menu for my kids as they get older.  Family friendly and great for vegetarians and gluten free alike!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and was pretty disappointed to be honest. 

Seating/table: me and my boyfriend went into the restaurant asking for a table for 3 - his mom drove separate and was looking for a spot. While it was a Friday night, there were at least 5 open tables. While we were waiting the 3 minutes for his mom to park, my boyfriend ran to the bathroom leaving me to wait by the door. As I was waiting the hostess approached me and said in a rather rude attitude \"we only seat groups If their whole party is here.\" I explained that our third member was parking the car and I'd be happy to wait to be seated with my whole group. There were 5 empty tables, so I wasn't worried about us getting a table. She insisted I be seated and acted like she was doing me a favor. 1 minute (literally) later, my party joined and we asked to be moved as the table was EXTREMELY wobbly. We were placed by the door and I froze the rest of the night, as there was a huge cold wind gust every time someone came or left. Ugh. 

The beer list was awful. Cinnamon Roll beer? Come on! Crazy flavors does not mean quality and Wisconsin people want quality in a tap house. 

The food was not impressive except for our appetizer, which is also the reason I am giving 3 stars and not 2. I highly recommend the Root Beer Glazed ribs. So delicious and the sweet potato mash it was served on was creamy heaven. I had the Pickled Grape salad and that was pretty tasty too. 

For my entree I had the Grilled Cheese with Brie, goat cheese, fig jam and caramelized onion. Sounds amazing right? That's what I thought too until it landed on my plate. Not melted, almost cold and a half inch of crust with no filling all around. Boooo! So so disappointing. 

The dessert was not good either. Pretzel bread pudding that was so so so dry. 

Not planning on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Visited Jacs for the first time last weekend.  First off, this place is popular!  The dinner wait at 6:30 pm was an hour, which was fine with us.  We got on the list, headed across the street for a drink, and eventually made our way back to Jac's bar for another drink and to finish our wait for a table.  The hostess and bar staff were friendly and once seated, so was our server.  

We ordered salads and entrees immediately upon being seated and then... waited.  It seemed like a very long time before our food finally arrived, and when it did our entree came out ahead of the salads.  We rushed through our salads while our food cooled on the table and the end result was we didn't get to enjoy either.  My Caesar salad was bland as was the risotto that accompanied my chicken dish.  For the chicken, one piece was perfectly seasoned with a crisp skin and the other was so salty I couldn't finish it (for balance, my dining partner had the same dish and loved the salty piece and didn't like the white meat piece I enjoyed).

This could have been an off night for the restaurant, so I contacted them the next day to share my experience and disappointingly never heard back.  Docked a star for the lack of follow-through from the restaurant management."}
{"text":"Nice quaint little place on Monroe Street. First timer. Right next to Michaels Frozen Custard. Parking is a little difficult but we found a spot on the street. No problem. I enjoyed actually waving the red flag to cross the street, another first for me. 

Onto the food...we'll wait, let's talk about the Wednesday special which is all about Gluten free products. $2 off gluten free beer taps and there is no up charge for gluten free buns, crust, etc. Good deal I thought. 

I had a Gluten Free Blonde IPA from Alt. Interesting. Not exactly my cup of tea but I had to try it. I'm all about exploring. 

I ordered the Three Little Pigs sandwich. Holy flavor!!! A must have for the hungry. Ham, Bacon and Pork Belly!! Swiss cheese, spinach and a pesto mayo on ciabatta bread. Delicious!! My wife had the smoked salmon BLT. I had a bite and it had this gorgeous smoky flavor to it. Really tasty. 

We both ordered frites with our sandwiches plus the different mayo's. Four different kinds, all unique. Even a cranberry mayo. 

We'll be back. Very cozy and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to Jacs for dinner with a group of approximately 12 ladies on a Monday evening. They warned us in advance that they are not normally able to accomodate groups as large as ours, but since we were planning to arrive early (5:30pm), it would be ok.

I'm so glad they made it work for us because the food was delicious!

We ordered the frites appetizer, which came with 4 dipping sauces, each better than the rest! I ordered the Jacs Classic burger for my entree and was very pleased with my choice! The burger was cooked well and quite tasty. The side salad was simple, with a light dressing.

Our entire group was licking their plates clean before we left.

I definitely recommend Jacs (but maybe don't go with a group of 12 people)."}
{"text":"We stopped in here at around 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty much empty, but we saw the solid Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.

They are certainly not setup for large groups, and seating even for just 4 people seemed to be about their max. We were hoping to sit by a window since it was nice and sunny out, but the tables by them were only 2 or 3 person tables and they told us they couldn't move them since it would mess up the spacing, which is kind of silly since there was one other table and a few people at the bar at the time.  It is a nice place inside through. I like their big wooden bar along with quite a bit of other woodwork in the place. They have some sort of sound dampening cushions hanging off of the ceiling that are absolutely covered in dust and cobwebs that they really need to do something about, but the rest is charming and comfortable. 

At 2PM, they only had their brunch menu available. I think they switched to a dinner menu at 3. There were some unique options, but they were very limited. They had a couple soups, a few appetizers, a few salads, 3 actual lunch options, and around 7 or 8 brunch selections. Not wanting brunch food, I went with their turkey sandwich. It was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it. There were orders of soup and a salad at the table as well. Nothing real special, but pretty appropriate for the price. The one person that ordered a breakfast option got the salmon benedict, which was very tasty but unfortunately they didn't get it fully deboned before cooking and serving the salmon. 

They have a really nice beer selection, but it seems much overpriced to me. We saw the same beers at other bars for quite a bit less. I suppose if you want a quiet atmosphere to enjoy a beer in, the extra dollar or two is worth it to come here instead of heading to the more busy areas. Our server was fine. Our waters stayed full and we got everything we needed. The one thing that I thought was super awkward was every time anybody at the table said thank you to her for anything, the response was always a monotone \"sure\". Maybe that is actually a perfectly appropriate response, but it seemed odd to me. 

I certainly wasn't disappointed in the trip here, but I also don't have this on any list of place I need to get back to. The food choices were limited but tasty, although nothing blew any of us away. Their beer includes great options, but is overpriced. The place is really nice, but the atmosphere was dead when we were there. Plenty of good things that might appeal to a different person, but it just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice for lunch. Both times I was very satisfied. Service was great, menu is a unique and the preparation of food is top notch. Enjoyed it and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I had the Jac's Classic burger and absolutely loved it! The burger was perfect, the frites were amazing, and my Wisco Sour drink was divine. I was also dining with a friend who eats gluten free, and she said it's one of the best gluten free options in town. There was a little bit of a wait, and the food was slightly pricey, but it was well worth it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, talented bar tenders that know their craft, and the best happy hour in town. Hands down, my favorite place for food and/or drinks in Madison. Thank you for being so awesome, Jac's!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jac's multiple times. My fiancée and I agree that its our favorite restaurant in Madison. Whether you get a burger, flatbread, sandwich, salad, or really any other entree, I haven't tried anything there that I don't like. They have a good beer list, and have a nice drink menu. Antonio is almost always our waiter and he rocks."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with some friends for a double date and it was fantastic! I got a New Fashioned which is a twist on an Old Fashioned and it was tasty. Our waitress gave us some amazing recommendations on food!  My husband had the Saltim Boccawich with frites and it was really good!! I got the Shrimp Rigatoni substituted chicken instead per our waitress's recommendation and it was phenomenal!! The sun dried tomato sauce was the best I have ever had!! I don't know if it all tasted so good because this was the first date my husband and I have had since our daughter was born 11 months ago or if it really was that good but all I know is that we will definitely go back! I wish I had taken pictures but it smelled and tasted so good that I forgot :)

Just be aware that currently Monroe Street is under construction and it is only accessible from the west so it makes it a little difficult getting there and parking can be challenging but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"So many amazing menu options it was very hard to decide! The frites are delicious and the portion is huge. They had a beer flight the night I went and I was very impressed with the selections! I got the suck breast and would get it again in a heartbeat. The Mac and cheese looked fantastic too. Service was ok and the place is small so it was a bit noisy. The minus one star is for the practically nonexistent parking on site. I parked a few blocks down in a residential area and hoped I didn't get a ticket. Perhaps there is parking I don't know about nearby but it all seemed reserved for other businesses or was taken. I hope I can go here again to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Jac's!

We stopped in for dinner on a Friday night and it was packed! We had to wait for a table, so we grabbed a drink at the bar, which was also cozy, but had great service from the bartender.

After waiting for about 30 minutes, we sat down and had a friendly, helpful waitress. She told us all about their specials, helped us choose a drink, and answered some questions we had about menu items.

I had the Dupond Pinot Noir to drink. It was pretty good for Pinot and reasonably priced.

For my dinner entree, I got the walnut burger and it was amazing. I love how creative Jac's is with their veggie options, which are abundant. I got it with the fries, which were also great.

There were two things I think the place could improve on: figuring out how to acquire more space and preventing cold air from coming in the front door.

Overall, the place is friendly, tasty, and fun. Everything tasted great, we had reliable service, and the prices were reasonable.  I would highly recommend if you haven't been before, especially for vegetarians and gluten-free folks. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I go there for Happy Hour.  Frequently.   Half-priced St. Bernardus 12 (always on tap) and a phenomenal selection of other local and world taps at Happy Hour defines the term."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their happy hour.... Amazing Bloody Mary's and half priced apps!  Their frites are memorable and highlighted by garlic aolli"}
{"text":"Food great. I had the beet salad and an order of frites. Service was so so. Atmosphere great. Great beer and wine selection. Quiche was mediocre. Food home made. Save room for dessert from MIchaels Custard next door.q"}
{"text":"This place is good.  The main dishes we had were solid.  However, the red potatoes on the side were totally undercooked.  I've usually had better experiences here though."}
{"text":"Excellent moules & frites. Better than Brasserie V and much better than Graze ones. The starter almond, bacon dates is really good. Like a lot the casual atmosphere. Highly recommended. 

It is ok to go with kids if you go before or after the main crowds. Flatbreads are
Also excellent."}
{"text":"A slight notch above decent bar food. It's a slightly formal venue in a great location. The staff were decent, but nothing to write home about. The food was good, but again would not go out of my way to book a table and go here again. The drink options were decent."}
{"text":"Fries are awesome, but the food was overpriced. A wonderful atmosphere for the family and easily accessible.  The staff was completely helpful in helping to pick out gluten free food.  They have a separate fryer that cooks food to accommodate gluten free individuals.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I sure like this place! Jacs in a really cute and eclectic part of Madison and it fits right in. I always look for something slightly interesting on the menu and I don't like to order the same thing twice, but at Jacs, the first meal I had was the kind that you go back for - the grapefruit brûlée and walnut burger."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner around 7pm on a Saturday night.  We were seated immediately.  This was a pleasant surprise since we typically end up waiting a long time at restaurants near the capital.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly. 

The food was delicious!  My husband had duck which was cooked perfectly and had incredible flavor.  The duck had a pomegranate glaze.  It was served with mashed sweet potatoes and some of the best Brussel sprouts I've ever tasted.  I had the wild mushroom poblano risotto which was also good.  We can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu!

My only complaint is that it can get a bit cold when people open the door, but it's winter, so there's not much they can do about it.  Bring a sweater.

Tip:  Almost everything on the menu can be made gluten free."}
{"text":"Went to Jacs for the first time last night and we were more than impressed with the food, service and atmosphere. The owner happened to be there sitting a few barstools down, and made sure we were treated like royalty. 

We tried the frites - homemade and excellent with all the dipping sauces. Our favorites were the aioli and the spicy buffalo one. The bacon-wrapped dates melted in our mouths. He even went out of the way to make sure one of ours was nut-free due to an allergy. The cheese plate was also a fun and delicious snack, which included sweet pickles, mustard, sliced baguette, apple, 3 different cheeses and a small pour of Serendipity.

Can't wait to go back! I can't stop thinking about those savory dates. Well done!"}
{"text":"We've lived nearby for three months and have already been 4 times. Every neighborhood should be lucky enough to have a place like Jac's. The atmosphere at dinner is warm, bustling, and inviting -- like e neighborhood restaurant should feel. 

The beer list is strong and varied -- typically seems to be a mix of local and Belgian. 

Where so many neighborhood places throughout the universe fall short, and Jac's doesn't, is the food. They do both dinner entrees and burgers & fries really well. Okay, the burgers are above really well. One of the best I've ever had. It is hard to order something else.

Only two gripes: 
1) why do so many other people also want to go here on Thursday and Friday night? 
2) burgers are a hair over usually, so be sure to order one temperature lower than you want it."}
{"text":"Went here tonight after reading all the positive reviews on here, and a write up in Madison Originals.  
Wanted the Almond stuffed Dates for our appetizer.  They were out of it.  We skipped the appetizer.
Had the Mussels w/chorizo (me), and the Special (hubby), can't remember the name of it, but it was a fish dish.  The mussels were pretty good, but not nearly enough chorizo.  The fish special was OK, but the size of the fish portion was very small.  They have good beer, and it's priced accordingly.  My diet Coke was flat.
We ordered the Flourless Chocolate cake, and the Bourbon Creme Brulee for dessert.  They were out of the Creme Brulee.  The flourless chocolate cake was the worst example I've ever had.  It was airy, (it's supposed to be super dense), and barely chocolaty (it's supposed to be intense dark chocolate).  It don't know whether they make it or buy it, but either way, it needs to change.  It's simply not good.  This was the first time I've EVER left flourless chocolate cake on the table, uneaten.
The place is very small, but the wait was extremely long for \"meh\" food.
We won't be returning."}
