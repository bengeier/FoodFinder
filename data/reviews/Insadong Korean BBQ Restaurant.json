{"text":"I've been to Insadong a few times and I've never been disappointed. The meat offerings are quite fatty (not my thing), but the taste is so good that I can bring myself to deal with it. The buckwheat (kasha) tea is my favourite part of every meal - so good. I've had the all-you-can-eat deal a couple of times and it's always good, but it's not the best value if you don't eat much. Though I've heard some people have had bad experiences with the service, I've always been impressed by the speed and quality. In my experience, AYCE dishes have been served within 5-10 minutes of ordering (sometimes within about 2 minutes!) and the servers come around quite often even when you're hidden away in a booth."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. I remember it used to be a bland restaurant with no spark in their atmosphere but then all of a sudden they renovated and have a nice new decor, like wow. 

To me Korean BBQ is the same no matter where you go the only difference is that Insadong offered free pop! Of course unlimited rice and sides but all KBBQ does the same. There's two menus to choose from, one being $26 per person or $21 per person. They both offer exactly the same selection but if you were to pay $5 more you'll get beef short ribs and beef ribs (limit to one order per person) 

Even though they are busy at times to me it feels like they are always short staff. My recent visit, we had to wait roughly 30 minutes until we get a server to take our order. I saw there was a group who got seated first but they were serviced right away which I find odd that they didn't have to wait and we did. One thing for sure is order as MUCH as you can because it will take a while for the server to come back and they won't take your order again until your whole previous order was complete - as in there's no food left to eat then they'll take your order again.

Would I recommend Insadong? Of course I will. How will they change my mind from 3 to 4 stars or even 5? Increase the efficiency of each staff or have more servers during busier times."}
{"text":"We went in for the all you can eat deal at 1pm. The place was almost empty. We choose our items got the food and cooked it ourselves. When we were ready for the 2nd round no one came out to help us despite the restaurant not being busy. I had to flag someone down. During our meal no one came to check up with us or offer us refill on the tea. After we paid and was leaving the restaurant a staff member came out and said they undercharged us. We didn't know there were two different all you can eat menu as I only saw the one for $22.99. They wanted us to pay 26.99 instead, we were not happy but paid anyways.
Been going to this restaurant for the last couple years. 
After this experience with customer service I would not go again and will not recommend it to anyone.
3 of us cost almost $90."}
{"text":"Good food.  Terrible service.  We had to keep asking for things.  Waitresses keep ignoring us."}
{"text":"Went to Insadong with my co-worker who is from Korea yesterday for lunch. Went to Seoul earlier this year and ever since have been craving Authentic Korean cuisine after coming back to Calgary.

The menu is quite extensive and the pictures were mouth watering. My co-worker ordered a Vegetable Bibimbap and I ordered a cold spicy noodle dish N3. The picture of the noodle dish had an egg, however when my noodles came out the egg was missing. There was no protein in the noodles, only a lot of red chili sauce, noodles and some vegetables. When I asked the waitress about the egg, she said that the noodle doesn't come with an egg. I asked to see the menu and pointed out that the picture had an egg. She went back to talk to the manager and the cook, and in Korean the manager kept on saying just tell them that there is no egg that comes with the dish, when the waitress pointed out that the photo of the dish had an egg on the menu the cook just laughed.

They ended up doing nothing about it. I only finished half of the noodles as it was pretty spicy. My co-worker advised that the vegetable Bibampap wasn't that good either and the picture looked a lot better.

There are other Korean restaurants in the city with better food and definitely better service. My Korean co-worker also didn't like the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 who were eager to try their all you can eat menu. The service was poor and their excuse of the cashier that they were having problems at the back was unacceptable. 

The restaurant wasn't even packed for lunch but the service was extremely slow. An order would take 35-45 mins to be served. There were even two dishes that weren't served at all, and we were just so tired of waiting, we paid the bill and left."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for korean comfort food. Nothing puts a cherry on top of a good day or rights a bad day as quick as a korean dish freshly made with love and awesomeness! Great flavours every time, this place is a fail safe for a great foodie experience."}
{"text":"Love the food!! I love their chicken cutlet and bulgogi! the only thing is that their service isn't that great... the staff their isn't as patient with the costumer and not as friendly. My whole family ate here today.. we enjoyed the food but when we ordered for seconds, it would take them 20 min to bring out and only have a couple pieces. The staff were rude to us except for this one waitress, Serina (i don't know how to spell her name) she was very friendly and helped us fix things. other than that I would come back."}
{"text":"You don't come to this place for its service which is spotty  most of the time.  You want something, you flagged them down and/or don't ask for a booth in the back.

You come here for their pork bone soup....it's the best in the city by far. I always get it with a side of sweet potato noodles foe a nominal charge. Meaty, rich, umami to the max!

 Any of their soups are typical of what you'd find being served boiling to you from a mom and pop food bar located in the back of  a korean supermarket.   

Other places have comparable or even better bbq, but tbh,  who wants run of the mill bbq all the time!  Their gems are the soups...specifically their  gamgatang. 

Try it, or don't...more for me!"}
{"text":"I have never waited longer for food. It took over an hour for them to bring us the orders of meat for us to cook. Perhaps they were understaffed that day. Food items tasted good but for the price the wait time and the diversity of available food was, imo, unacceptable."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Food is average price....however they often forget to bring out things and you have to ask multiple times for things that they might bring you.

Dine in experience consists of 3people eating while one person waits for his meal...

All you can eat is...ok....however if there is more then one other table doing it. Good luck being able to breathe!!!

Take out is pretty much the same as dine in...they forget half ur order! 
Overall ive given this place far too many chances!! Eat at seoul on macleod.....dont waste ur time and money at this dump"}
{"text":"Four of us ordered the large bulgogi hot pot to share.  The food is served fresh and in generous portions, as we came in famished and left with full bellies. The complimentary rice juice at the end for dessert was a refreshing and pleasant surprise.  One thing to note is there does not seem to be a good ventilation system in place here as I noted hanging smoke from meats on the grill, even if our table did not have BBQ-- if you plan to visit, wear clothes you can easily toss in the wash."}
{"text":"Came here during non busy hours and service was just absolutely atrocious so terrible that I felt the urge to get up and leave. The high wooden walls didnt help when I needed service. The kettle of tea was basically gone by the time I had even ordered. Waitresses and waiters were just on their phones the entire time. Food overall was good but sanitation was highly needed. Food handling was very unsanitary. Overall would recommend for food but not at all for service."}
{"text":"Always had their all you can eat option whenever we go here, their food is good. However, they can be understaffed at time and I don't know why but their food is inconsistent- sometimes their spicy pork bulgogi would be spicier than before, etc. sometimes they would provide you complimentary tea then sometimes they don't. But me and my friends always come back here because it's the cheapest Korean AYCE you can find in Calgary."}
{"text":"Insadong is the closest Korean resto from my place. We used to come here all the time since my family is a sucker for anything Asian. Food is okay. Got nothing to complain abt the food. I have something negative to say about the service though. They are always, and I mean always short staffed, hence, service is slow. Everything is slow. Food, service, once it took us 15-20min waiting for our bill, and another 10min of wait for the cashier. Wish I'm exaggerating, but nope. Maybe if there are more servers or kitchen staff, we would come and visit again."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant by a recommendation from a friend. When I went in, I was surprised by how dim the restaurant was, however my eyes adjusted and I was fine. I ordered a galbitang, and some side dishes. While the soup wasn't as good as some other Korean places I've been to, I thought it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the lunch box was a lot of food for a very reasonable price!

It was delicious!

I am definitely going to come back for the BBQ.

I'll put the dong in me anyday!"}
{"text":"Came here with my adventurous food friend. I thought the service was great and the food was even better. The d√©cor is dated and needs work...

Will come back if I have a Korean craving!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find an all you can eat Korean place in Edmonton if there's even any, and I was really happy to find one here in calgary. 
This place was packed when we came. Food was pretty good. Service was a little slow. However I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good place for Korean BBQ! Being able to cook the meat (All You Can Eat) at your table is fun and their 'Lunchbox' menu is a good price for the food you get! We enjoy coming here a lot!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner. Service was terrible could not get them to show interest in order and felt as they were rushing to get us out even though it was not busy lots of empty tables. All you can eat menu very limited compared to most."}
{"text":"I came here several times in the past month. Sure, the service isn't the greatest, but the people are friendly and I never had any issues with it. Last time I went, the server was quite fast and he came by every once in a while to check if we needed anything. 

Their soups are phenomenal, and I absolutely love their seafood pancake. I've had the kimchi jigae, gamjatang, and the kimchi hotpot. All were really good and full of flavor. Gamjatang takes the first spot with the really tender meat (and lots of it too!) and very yummy soup. Seafood pancake is always crispy and very nicely done. As a bonus, you get unlimited side dishes for free whereas other places charge you for extras. 

All in all my new favorite Korean place in town, I'll be coming back more in the future."}
{"text":"I loved this Korean restaurant!  I've recently eaten here twice & both times the food was healthy & delicious! The service was good too; very organized & friendly. Great prices & so many choices on the menu. 
All dishes included \"banchan\" which are many small dishes such as kimchi, picked vegetables, small salad, etc.
At the end of the meal, they also gave us a free cold slushy dessert which was very good!!

I'll definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had all you can eat tonight, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to serve our first order!!! That's a f****joke that ruined my mood. See you never!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is POOR! Food is okay, i expected more since it's in Canada and I'm from Seattle."}
{"text":"Been here before and after the renovation and still love this place. 
The Service is so-so it really depends on if its a very busy night or not.
Booths are always a plus for me. 
The food is amazing a must try."}
{"text":"Came her for my sister birthday dinner. It was busy but not packed. We got a table right away. The service was terrible. It seem like the waitress didn't want us there. She kept ignoring us when we tried to order and ask for water. 

We ordered the japchae (2/5), Jajangmyeon (3/5), bulgogi hot pot (2/5 and they didn't give us a spoon for the soup) and seafood pancake (3/5).  Overall food was a bland."}
{"text":"Ordered take out recently here for the first time.  I was a bit disappointed that they only gave two small size side dishes, given that I ordered 3 entrees... was expecting a lot more to be honest.  Some items on their menu are pretty pricey in my opinion for what you get... for instance, the So Wang Galbi (Marinated Grilled Beef King Ribs) was $33 if I remember correctly for only two smallish ribs."}
{"text":"Ohhh man Insadong! Is crazy amazing! I would've given this place a 4.5 if it would let me! But man this place is ridiculously delicious! I found Insadong on their second month after opening and it wasn't that popular then but I could tell even then that they would be.

First of all, when it isn't busy, service is really good. Very fast, the staff are all very nice and friendly. The owner is so nice as well and she always smiles! When it isn't busy they're quite attentive and often times stop for a conversation.

But when they're busy it's sometimes hard to get water or tea. It's very minor and there's a lot of people working in Insadong.

Their food is superb, not once was I ever disappointed. Ever. I was always happy with their food. The all you can eat is really good quality and very cheap. My fiancee loves the salad. My sister and I loves the pickled radish!

I would recommend the amazing spicy chicken. So delicious! Their portions are no jokes either and you get plenty! Their side dishes are a plus, they're refillable with no extra charge!

The overall environment of Insadong is sparce, it's not really where you should go if you only go to restaurants your eyes wants to feast in, okay? A restaurant is a restaurant and their food speaks volumes. If you want a pleasant high quality decorations, this is not the place. This place is family, honesty, and down to earth. If you're looking for nice flattering lighting on a date, or nice fancy seats and silverware, this is not for you.

On a side note, I really do hope they improve their ventilation in the whole restaurant. When someone starts to cook their own BBQ on their tables, you will smell smoke and you will smell like meat when you get out. And you will have to take a shower.

Out of all the positives and negatives my true wish for insadong is a better ventilation system, it's the only thing they need go improve on, in my opinion.

I've recommended my friends and coworkers to this place and they all always come back (except for those who wants to look at museums instead of eating good food).

I definitely recommend this place and if it would have let me my total score is 4.5/5. Points lost to the ventilation system."}
{"text":"So-on tofu.   I finally found you in Calgary.   I live this place
 It is the Korean food dreams are made of. 

Eat here.   It's delicious.   I've had Korean around the world and this place is up there. 

Good prices 
Meals for groups. 
LOve it"}
{"text":"Food was very good and you get good value for the all you can eat menu. The service was very slow though. We came on a Wednesday and it wasn't very busy and had to ask twice for certain items. If the service was better then I'd give it a solid 4 stars. I would still come back as the food is good quality and portions are generous. The restaurant is clean and the decor was cute."}
{"text":"I can't believe how bad the service is here, I even tried to self serve myself tea and got my teapot stolen. I never saw my teapot or got my tea ever again after several failed attempts. I believe these individuals suffer from amnesia. 

I'm sorry for all the other patrons who thought I was a waiter, I wish I could help you.  

As for the food, it was cold by the time they got it to us. 

I highly suggest anyone reading this review to not eat here. There are other restaurants that are more deserving of my money."}
{"text":"Absolute best Gamjatang in town. I've tried many many places for it and Insadong is the best, hands down. Husband claims he could eat it everyday. Never disappoints and is always consistently good. The mains on the other hand are a hit or miss but most soups are very good. All you can eat is also very good. And lunch specials are a great deal as well. 
Overall Insadong is our family's go to korean restaurant and we would rather take the time to visit here rather than have disappointing meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I only come here for the spicy pork bone soup (K9) on the menu.  Delicious pork bone, in a spicy broth - perfect for those cold days like today!  Ask for extra spicy if you get a chance - even more delicious spicy flavour.  We called in ahead to place our order and it was ready to go when we here.  Saved us a ton of time as we have a little one."}
{"text":"Insadong Korean Restaurant is located on 920 36 St North East Calgary.  My boyfriend's friend invited me and my boyfriend to this restaurant for lunch on last Saturday. Before moved to Calgary, my boyfriend and I were always having Korean food at Insadong Korean Restaurant in Vancouver.  This was our first time trying Korean food in Calgary. This restaurant has the same name as the one in Vancouver, but the different restaurant. We wish to have a great experience before we went.  We were there around 1 pm. The restaurant was a bit busy when we arrived. Luckily, we got a table so fast. We waited for the table server come to our table about 20 -30 minutes. I think it's because of the busy environment,  the servers were very busy.  Our table server was nice and friendly.  My boyfriend and I have ordered Lunch Box, Kimchi Strew, Sweet Sour Pork, and Takoyaki. His friend ordered the beef bowl.  The food came out the kitchen fast. All the food was well cooked. Side dishes were great and fresh. The sweet-sour pork was my favorite dish. The pork was soft with sweet sour sauce, some fruits and vegetable on top, which was very tasty. I couldn't believe it was awesome. Takoyaki balls were OK but they tasted like frozen one. Lunch Box was in the medium portion of little bit everything, which includes Salad, Seafood Pancakes, rice, beef, and potatoes. I didn't get a chance to try them. Kimchi Strew was one of my favorite Korean food. I always ordered it in any Korean restaurant. The kimchi strew at Insadong Korean Restaurant was in super large portion. There were lots of meat, kimchi and soup in the big bowl. But, the taste of the strew was super super salty. I couldn't even tell it's kimchi.  In summary, it was a decent Korean Restaurant, but I still like the Insadong Korean Restaurant in Vancouver more."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for while. My first visit wasn't that bad and was not that great either. Then my previous visit the restaurant, I was surprised 'cause they have improved so much about the service, dinning area, menu and their food quality. They didn't disappoint my loyalty!!"}
{"text":"Best Korea lunch box in the city. The #11 LA short rib lunch box is out of this world. So favorable and an enormous amount of food.  Love that they include a few pieces of seafood pancake! Also tried the pork bone soup, not the best one I've had but pretty good. Great value, all together a delicious lunch option."}
{"text":"It's exhausting to get their attention and then to ask for every little thing...  Like sauce and lettuce, when they should just bring it for you. 

They are friendly,  but service is spotty... Mainly due to the high wooden walls and lake of service button."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, it tastes exactly like the first time I had it, 3 years ago. It's such an great feeling for my tastebuds. The service though, could be a bit better...."}
{"text":"I was asked to go here because it was my friend's birthday and he really likes this restaurant.  I'm not too sure why..

1) When making the reservations there was a few \"lost in translation\" moments.  \"Table for 4 please.\"  \"Ok, for how many?\"  \"4.\"  \"How many people?\"
Yikes!  Finally after a few minutes we got it.

2) I had to call again to change the reservation.  It took a minute or two before I could even get them to understand that I already had a reservation and I wanted to change it to 8 people.  Even after getting off the phone I had the feeling they didn't know what I wanted.

3)  We arrived.  The place was huge and there were hardly any people in the restaurant.  Because some of the people had kids and needed a high-chair we asked to sit at the end of a row.  One person said it was OK so we did that.  When the rest of the guests arrived we were *told* (not asked, but told) to move back.  Instead of arguing we just moved (yet the place was pretty empty).

4)  Lighting is terrible.  First of all, it was all florescent lighting; what is this an office?  Second, *all* (and I'm not exaggerating here) of their light fixtures had at least one burned out or dim tubes.  What's worse than florescent lighting?  Blinking, dim florescent lighting.

5)  Service was slow, terrible and down right rude.  When bringing out our food they just went to the end of the table and shoved the plates into one spot expecting us to pass it down. What is this?  Prison???  I did not sign-up for a Korean prison here.  Plus, they never told us our cast iron bowls were hot (I assumed they were) but most places will warn patrons of danger.  They didn't care.

But wait.. there's more....

6)  I went to the washroom and noticed both washroom doors (men's and ladies) were propped open and they were close to the kitchen.  Enough said!

As far as food is concerned their prices are cheap.  So if you don't really care about service quality this would be a place to go for a cheap meal.  However, if I want cheap and good service I'd rather eat at home.

See ya later In-SAD-ong!"}
{"text":"The food was good but service was terrible. The waitress had to be flagged down every time and she seemed annoyed every time you did get to order. One item On their all you can eat ran out (bbq short ribs !) and honesty, you should probably turn the heat on. It's a full restaurant the least you can do is hire enough staff, turn the heat on, and have all your items on your 'all you can eat' menu"}
{"text":"I have never had Korean BBQ before, and I must say it was quite the experience.....experience of MEAT greatness! 
Oh my word, it was the most flavorful meat I have ever had! Every one had a different taste, I loved them all :)
We had dinner for two, and we had them cook the meat, cook the meat to perfection might I add! As well as we ordered the crispy spicy chicken, I don't have words for how delicious this meal was! 
We had a crazy amount of food, this meal was for 3-4 more than 2 but heck we had food to take home and enjoy all over again! 
Can't wait to have another meat coma!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong value wise with this place for their lunch boxes. My favorite is pork belly and spicy chicken. I can eat a lot but for around 12$ a head, this is pretty awesome. 

The decor is nice and clean plus the music isn't too loud. The one thing they lose points on is service.. most days there is only 1 server.. which sucks and I can understand but...
There has been two times where I've waited 15 mins plus just to order. I've walked out once because of it and that's why I'll give them 3 stars.

If this place had better service.. I would be happy to give insadong 4 stars.. but I'm sitting here 18 mins in still waiting"}
{"text":"OK, I'm updating my review from 3 to 4 stars...
I love love the new decor...and they didn't even change their price.
Now I hope that they would do something about the vents...better vents so that when you get out of there you don't smell like BBQ....hihihi
I don't like wearing my food...hihi
Same kitchen crew. I think they need more waitress...they are all running...I feel bad...they are constantly in a hurry.
The food is still great...very yummy...I always order the chicken wings...so good...yum yum..."}
