{"text":"Wonderful breakfast restaurant. Very nice staff. Fresh delicious food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place to eat. Great food, great service, great prices. We have only had the breakfast, but the other food looks amazing and we can't wait to try it.  It is a must try for anyone who likes great food!!!"}
{"text":"The husband and I were in the mood to eat out for breakfast and decided to try this place out after dropping the kiddies off at school.  Located in the Target center off of the 95 and Cheyenne, it was pretty easy to find the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is small but pretty spacious with several tables and bar area.  I especially love the chalkboard sign behind the bar stating their house specials.  I thought it was very cute.

One thing that did stand out about this place is that they offer loyalty cards.  This is the first I've seen where they offer a loyalty card for meals.  I normally see stamp cards for boba or coffee shops, never for meals.  But their loyalty card gives you $10 off your tenth meal.  So that's pretty much or almost a free meal, which is great if you are a regular here.

Now for the food, I can't really say there was a wow factor for us.  It's pretty much your average breakfast spot.  However, like others have stated, their portions are pretty big.  I decided to get the Cali omelette and there was just way too much cheese for my liking.  I also thought their pancakes were a bit on the chewy side.  The husband's lovers breakfast pretty much included everything.  So if you have a big appetite, I would recommend that.  But did we enjoy our meals?  It wasn't bad, but like I said, nothing really stood out for us in regards to the food.  Its definitely an option for breakfast though if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Got seated right away, and the food was awesome. Ordered the chicken omelette with home style potatoes. It was hot and super fresh. The wait staff was very nice and friendly. I will definitely be returning to try the menu items they serve for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week with all my coworkers. We all LOVE this place and it's affordable and has something everyone likes.  Except don't order juice because it's $3 for a half glass. I think I get a gallon of juice for $2.50 at the store. But besides that, it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best breakfast I've ever had ever. Had the country fried steak and eggs with an English muffin(The muffin is made in house as well as the batter for the CFS)

The owner Hugo is awesome and friendly to talk to and his son in the kitchen an amazing cook. I will most definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!  Super friendly staff, very cute and clean inside, love this place"}
{"text":"I can see why everyone rates this place as 5 stars. We came here after finding it on Yelp and were not disappointed. 
Had the bacon, sausage, cheese omelet. It was not only good but was huge. Service was way over excellent. Fresh brewed ice tea and daughter said coffee was good also. 
This is a family owned and run restaurant and not one of the corporate places. Which makes it even better. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was the second time trying the place and I won't be back.  

Pros: large portions, clean restaurant, friendly staff

Cons:  Never enough employees.  There's one cook and both times there was only one waitress.  She appeared to be new and didn't know the menu too well when questions were asked.  The food took awhile to get to our table, and both times my order was wrong.  My friends ordered toast and fruit as sides; the toast was forgotten & potatoes were given instead of fruit.  When my friend asked for iced tea to go, the waitress gave him hot tea.  It took forever for the waitress to ring us up.  Omelets are priced between $9.99-$13.99.  My bill with the meal, coffee and tip came up to $19, which is a little expensive in my opinion for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good quality ingredients, awesome service, generous portions, clean, spacious between tables. Loved it."}
{"text":"I ordered food through delivery for my wife and I. The first time the driver came, the delivery only had one of my orders. I called and told them, they said they would deliver the what they didn't bring. When the driver came the second time, my food was cold. Maybe our experience would've been different if we would've went and dined in. Other than that the food did come in a large portion for a fair price."}
{"text":"This is our 1st time here it is in a shopping center next to target it's pretty easy to find it has a big coffee cup on the outside walking in the   ambience and the location is perfect the décor is fresh wide open and very inviting our food was absolutely delicious the bacon was nice and big crispy, eggs, hash browns cook very well love the size of the toast of the sour dough I had the bacon-and-eggs and hubby had the breakfast steak mix it's nice to see daily specials on a big wall so you can choose, going to come back and try some lunch specials.

 Is it a tradition for me and my husband to pay it forward and file lunch or breakfast for someone in the restaurant other restaurants at issues this restaurant was very accommodating and very low key about it which is absolutely what we love.

I beautiful husband and wife team works here that made the service and the meal that much better."}
{"text":"My review is from my experience this morning now this could be because they just opened up so they are probably getting in the rhythm of things. But it was a little chaotic it was a busy morning. when we walked in, there were a few dirty tables. When we were sat down it took a while for the waitress to come to our table. We ordered our food but we were never asked if we wanted water. While waiting for my food I did observe a few things, the roles that each person that works there didn't seem to be clear. The girl behind the counter which I assume should be your hostess was bussing and when she was taking  the tray to the back she was trying to hand it to a young kid who said to her \"that's your job\". Your customers should not be witnessing employees disputing their job duties. The table behind us was waiting a long time and we received our food before them. The food was good my husband ordered the Fresh toast full plate and I ordered the 2 Pancakes with 2 eggs, 1 sausage the waitress brings one little cup of syrup and 1 little cup of butter for 2 orders that clearly require more than one little cup I had to ask for my side of syrup and butter. To their defense they did have a party of 12 that probably through them off their game. We probably go back and try them again since second chances are always good."}
{"text":"Great and tasty food. Ordered delivery through GrubHub and was pleasantly surprised by the fast and seamless delivery. Would definitely order again and pay a visit to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food portions were huge for their prices! It was also near a target which is a plus. Staff is extremely friendly:"}
{"text":"My family ate here today and it was great! The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. I had the country fried steak breakfast, husband had the pancake breakfast and son had the kids meal burger sliders. The restaurant and restrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! We tried this for breakfast this morning and it was really good! The portions are HUGE, I think we could have had a single meal for the three adults! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with everything in this place, the ambient ,the food,the people. It was very welcoming. I could say that me and my family left wanting to go back and try other meals. Awesome place and the prices are just right. I definitely know we are going back to the Breakfast Bar. By the way their Habanero Burger is out of this world!!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place here on YELP. Verry happy with the find. The guy who owns it is extremely nice and really cares on weather his customers are happy. This is a new place, it needs support from the community. I had wheat pancakes and they were huge and delicious. I am Vegan and it's hard to find places in Vegas to eat. I learned that they have vegan dishes that are not on the menu.. they need to be.  I will be back. I have been back 3 times since the original review. They are still top natch"}
{"text":"My family went here for a late breakfast today. I decided I wanted something different and ordered the Pasta Mia upon the recommendation of another Yelper. I don't think I could have made a better choice as it was AMAZING! Spicy, creamy, and incredible flavor. One of the best pasta dishes I've EVER had!"}
{"text":"While visiting the area we stumbled upon this restaurant before heading to Red Rock for a hike! Everyone working there was very friendly! The food was amazing. I can't decide if the breakfast potatoes or hash browns were better! Both potato styles were very well seasoned and cooked to perfection! The pancakes were fluffy, the country fried chicken was flavorful, and the French toast was tasty! My brother and his fiancée said that it was some of the best coffee they've had as well. I highly recommend Breakfast Bar, I'm glad we had found it! Also, the price point is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wasn't anything special. Good atmosphere and okay service. I had the sea omelette and there wasn't that much flavor to it and some of the shrimp wasn't peeled all the way. The house potatoes were good. You do get a lot of food for what you pay."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. Definitely putting this on the list of places to go."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice sit down place for breakfast and discovered the Breakfast Bar through Yelp. I  ordered the French toast, which was delicious. The bread was fresh and not stale, the eggs were fluffy and the bacon was... well bacon!!!! The atmosphere was inviting, my server Yolanda was great! The chef Hugo came out and asked everyone if everything was okay and I found out he was also the owner. He sat and talked to me for a minute and I told him how much I enjoyed my food and he gave me a loyalty card which I will definitely use!!!"}
{"text":"Our new breakfast spot! Found this little breakfast place next to target thought we would try it out. Good food, good service, loved the ambiance and environment. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. I came in Friday morning,  place was empty except for myself and the staff, but takeout orders were coming out of the kitchen like crazy.  They were playing new country over the speakers and were sweet enough to change it for me since it was damn near torture to listen to and my phone was dead,  oh and they charged my phone for me while I ate. Order a vegi omelette with avacado and turkey sausage, that plus a cup of coffee came out to 20 bucks,  a little pricey for my taste,  even with the add ons, but was delicious none the less.  Service was awesome, staff was super friendly and accommodating, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 4 cause the server ask me if I needed water, living in Vegas never should ask for a refill... other wise food was amazing French toast was amazing like littler spots like this comparable to Jamms,stack n yolk, and egg and I.     It really tiny but not to small. I came on a Sunday so don't no if it's gets busy here but was able to walk right in and get seated immediately......great atmosphere and people were quite pleasant and nice too ........"}
{"text":"This place serves a nice selection of omletes, burgers, pancakes and other diner style classics. Prices are reasonable, and service was quick when we were there. They seem to be offering 2 for 1 dinner, 4-8 pm."}
{"text":"The food was good. If I had to compare it I'd say that the food tasted better than Denny's or IHOP but not as good as Eggs Works or the Cracked Egg. The food is pretty affordable. The plates are about $12. The best thing we ordered was the western burger (name?) it was juicy and flavorful. Everything else just tasted like basic diner food.

The customer service here is lack luster. I understand that they are understaffed (that's what it looked like), but If the food isn't going to stand out then the least that they could do is make sure that the drinks are refilled, that the table has straws, and that we don't have to ask for basic customer service. 

I'll be back but I hope the service improves. 

... UPDATE...: 
I was contacted by the owner to come back in and review the place again. This time the customer service was great, but I think it's mainly because they were focused on trying to change my perspective on the restaurant. One thing I can say is that the food was so good this time. This place has better dinner food than breakfast food. We tried the Pasta Mia and we were impressed by how balanced the flavors were. I recommend that dish 100%. this place is around the corner from my house so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! This is my husband and I's new spot! We love the owners, they are so nice and the food is so good! The menu has a lot to choose from and we have liked everything we've ordered! Definitely check this one out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Maybe i caught them on a bad day.  I patronized restaurants at this location before.. the african restaurant and mt view inn.
I ordered bisciuts and gravy.. with homestyle potatoes and sausage n eggs...
Honestly.. two small biscuits that seemed to have the same texture as pillsbury grands from a can... the gravy lacked thickness and seasoning..... see your competitor... bagel cafe 
. For a solid gravy.. thick and creamy ..and a fresh biscuit....
The menu looks appealing... i really wish them luck.... tough. Mall for a restaurant.....
Service was ok... could have been more attentive....
Las vegas ... in particular summerlin has so many excellent places for breakfast... bagel cafe.. baby stacks... stacks n yolks...cinnamons.... you really need to strive to their level.....
Maybe i try u again but... i dont know..."}
{"text":"Casual with great service. Both omlettes were very good. Coffee was also very good. Quiet while they ramp up so you can still hear yourself think. I will come back again."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat! Great food, great prices, and excellent service. It's a bit hard to find but definitely worth the effort!"}
{"text":"It was alright, I read previous reviews before trying this place so I thought it was good. It was convenient and only 3 minutes away from work so I stopped by when I got off. The food was ok, I had an omelette to go and only took 10 minutes to drive home so it was still warm."}
{"text":"Great service and food was tasty. The price was right as well. I will come back again :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you! We found this place because we were looking for a good breakfast spot but ended up finding our favorite lunch spot! 

You NEED to try their Pasta Mia plate. Honestly probably one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The pasta is made with some type of chipotle creamy sauce. It is a bit on the spicy side but that's what I LOVED about it. You have the choice to have it made with either chicken or shrimp. I chose chicken. It has lots of sauce. So much flavor in on plate. 

They also have other food items that aren't specifically BREAKFAST . 

Only downfall is they close at 3:00 every day."}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was good. The food was great and the workers were super nice and had great personalities. This place has huge portions and makes you really feel like you're getting a great amount for what you're paying for. 

The only reason I am giving this place a 4 star instead of 5 is because throughout our service, the waitresses forgot several things such as our drinks (the waitress actually ordered drinks for everyone at the table but forgot about me, leaving me with no drink) and forgetting parts of our order."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. Everything about this place is fantastic. From the food, to the atmosphere, to the people. The food is absolutely amazing and a great price. The atmosphere makes you feel warm and cozy and on top of it all, the employees make you feel so happy. 10/10 would recommend this any day!"}
{"text":"This place has HUGE portions and extremely friendly service. Great value. I would definitely come here again. It's fairly cheap but the plates are almost enough for 2 people!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad !!!! But it wasn't good at all. The menu was blahhhh and when we got our food everything tasted , weird. My omelet had runny eggs still and the sundries tomatoes tasted bitter. The didn't taste like coffee and then to top it off their card machine was down. ?"}
{"text":"Had the best chicken omelette here, the avocado was extremely fresh. Portion size is very generous and reasonably priced. If you love breakfast check out this place. I highly reccomend it. Very comfortable place, great for a breakfast date!"}
{"text":"Man the fact that their prices are just the same if you were to go grab some breakfast from McDonald's blew my mind because the food was sooooo goood! I'm not even a big breakfast person. I only really go out to eat breakfast a lot because my husband just happens to love breakfast (we're opposites lol). But the pancakes, bacon, and hash were so good that I cleaned my plate. The pancakes were light and fluffy....filled me up. The bacon was so good...not too thick or thin...really flavorful. The hash was some of the best I've every had. They were lightly cooked and the seasonings were light and flavorful. Very nice laid back set up. And the servicer handled the whole room herself, and she was fast and friendly. I'll be back often. Eff you ihoB ( to the name change) lol."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food .
They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ...
The food was delivered extremely fast on 14 miles from the restaurant !
Definitely will   Order again !!
Thanks Breakfast Bar"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go e this place a try. We were definitely not disappointed!!!
The place was a Clean modern setting with great food and service.  The bene was great and coffee was on point.  Definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place by Mountain View Hospital. Friendly staff who were very attentive. I ordered the French toast with fried eggs, hash browns and bacon. French Toast was delicious but the hash browns were exactly how I like with being super crunchy on the outside and soft on the side like a pancake. They season theirs with what seemed like a southwest type of flavor. Definitely recommend, especially since my meal was $12.75 with my iced tea, a meal that would have been double at Black Bear or Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"First time to visit this little place. Greeted when we walked in. Food was very good, atmosphere is pleasant. Food arrived quickly and service was very good. Says breakfast bar but offers other fare besides breakfast. Will try again for lunch or dinner. Very reasonably priced entrees."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Met the owner and his wife. Wish them well. I love to support local family run businesses. Liked the decor and the layout. Staff is friendly and helpful. I had the Cali Omelette.
Well priced and good portions. I'd like to try a burger next time. I will definitely recommend to friends who live/work nearby. I like their coffee mugs too."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here because of the yelp reviews and the good ones are true! Portions are big and it came out hot and quick. Hugo is the owner and he is super friendly. I had the chicken omelette and my husband had the chicken fried steak. The gravy has chunks of sausage! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"1st time here. always went to Target right next door and never noticed this little restaurant. service was great. food was super delicious. the Pasta Mia was my plate and I couldn't finish it since it was a big portion but I have leftovers. =] . definitely coming back for breakfast next time. baby mama got the French toast , super delicious. best part is the owner came out (he's also the cook) and asked our opinion ask our experience. very great family restaurant. check this place out."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best breakfast in town. If you enjoy eggs benedict this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I love it here. We went for breakfast last week and it was so good that we had to go again for dinner. Every dish we had was so fresh and absolutely delicious. And on top of it, the staff was fantastic. They made the visit worth while. Hope everyone knows how great this restaurant is."}
{"text":"Oh, man where do I begin?  I really wanted to like this place.  The photos of the food makes it look so good.  Well, the coffee was fantastic. However, I question the freshness of the food. 

I ordered an omelet with Swiss cheese, which I get everywhere I go. That's my standard in which I measure a new breakfast place.  My omelet was so hot. Burn my mouth let it cool down hot.  Which is strange because in comparison my homefries were barely warm and were a little mushy. The Swiss cheese was rubbery and not melted which means 1.  It is old cheese. 2. It has been exposed to air which means not properly stored. Or 3. Inferior quality product. I could not chew it.  My omelet had barely any discernible cheese inside it. My omelet was also greenish/grey in color, which is harmless but indicates OLD EGGS.  I was charged a dollar for soupy sour cream. Also an indication of freshness. And I think a dollar for a small ramekin of sour cream is excessive. I can go to Walmart and buy a  6 oz. container of fresh sour cream for the same price.  My sour dough toast was fine but they serve margarine which is disgusting. 

Maybe they don't use food up fast enough.  I was there at 1pm.  Only one other couple was there. There were crumbs on the chair next to my table. The booth bench was littered with crumbs. This place is not inviting.  It's white and shades of lime green sherbet but still manages to be dark and cavernous. There is one string of lights and that's it for lighting. I mean I could read but it wasn't bright and cheery. There is not art on the walls. When you walk in you wonder if it's actually open.

The service was good.  I asked for water and the server put it so far out of my reach I almost had to get up to get my water. I am not a tyrannosaurus with little arms. . My server and the other server AND another person, owner, manager??? Asked how everything was.  I said it was fine. I was also asked again by the manager who had literally asked me the same question five minutes earlier when I was cashing out.  I said it was fine. It wasn't. I wasn't looking for a free meal and I wasn't interested in having it remade and giving them a chance to \"fix\" the problem.  What were they going to do?  Make my omelet over with the same old cheese and old eggs? Find fresher sour cream? They should have made my food with fresh ingredients in the first place.  It wasn't any less expensive or more expensive than other places with much better food. 

I won't be coming here again. I don't trust it."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Great food, excellent customer service and food came out within minutes. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a normal brunch spot. The only reason I give it a 4 star is because I ordered the habanero burger med rare and it came out med well, I'm not too picky on how my burger is cooked so I ate it anyway. The burger is pretty good, could use some pepper or something. And they have the good ranch"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and try out a new breakfast place bc other places were too busy and it was the first yelp result and ended up pleasantly surprised! Place is very cute, clean, and inviting and the food was also great too. Nice service as well. Definitely will make this a stop for breakfast in the future!!"}
{"text":"Great little place for a meal. Great concept: SIMPLE. Good food. Generous portions. Very reasonable prices. Excellent staff."}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast at lunchtime I had the sausage and egg breakfast with sourdough toast. Service and breakfast was fantastic. The hashbrowns were some of the tastiest I've had."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! There was no wait when we arrived. The staff was so friendly and very attentive. Our waitress, Ivon, was so sweet, the service was quick, and THE FOOD WAS GREAT! The omelette was still steaming from the grill and our salad was fresh and crispy! Definitely recommend the fruit salad with grilled chicken breast and the omelettes are huge! So you don't have to worry about the potions being too small! Would highly recommend again! Thanks again Ivon!"}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast for my family this morning through GrubHub using the Yelp app.  There was food was missing from my order and the restaurant refused to acknowledge or provide a refund. I ordered a pancake special that was missing a sausage, should have had 2. The lover special should have came with pancakes and toast and we got neither. They tried to say that the pancakes were in a separate container and they were, but for the pancake special. Cali Mex omelette should have had cheese, sausage and avocado and it was missing avocado. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Worried about being so small and only 1 person there in the afternoon....but food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Friendly customer service, good food, clean interior, and fair prices! I got the Pancake Special which came with 2 pancakes, eggs, and bacon for $6.99 (see picture submitted.) The pancakes and eggs were good and the the bacon was excellent! Overall a very positive experience for our first breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just tried this new place! Don't let the outside discourage you, inside is a quaint, bright and shiny restaurant. I had the Cali Mix omelette, which was huge! My daughter had the French Toast which can with eggs and bacon. They even have flavored creamer for our coffee. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients,big potions,great service,great breakfasts.One of the best club sandwiches I've had.I,been here about 20 times and will be coming back.    
 The best all around place on the NW side."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Breakfast was really good, amazing services and prices aren't bad either.  I had the Benet it was good, my mom had egg white omelet and from the small conversation we had while eating I'm assuming she love it lol. Definitely will be back, maybe next time for dinner."}
{"text":"Just tried this place because we got coupon in the mail. Now our favorite breakfast spot. A little pricey but woth every penny"}
{"text":"Just an amazing breakfast!!!! Hugo , the owner, took our order and cooked our meal! The Lover Breakfast was the best combo breakfast I have ever had. Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared. This is a meal that will satisfy the biggest appetite. The bene veggie was just as amazing. Service was great and the interior is simple, but nice. Hugo was very accommodating with my food restrictions. We will be back!!!! Great place to eat a comfortable and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great food very fresh! Staff very friendly, menu has lots of choices. You can order breakfast for lunch...yum!"}
{"text":"this place is  awesome  I really recommen this food it all good"}
{"text":"This place is fine. Food is nothing extraordinary but it's good traditional breakfast fare."}
{"text":"This place is great. The green decor gives you a very relaxing mood. Food is amazing, and theres not a wait. Plus!!! You get a Target right next to it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were planning on going to breakfast somewhere else when we saw the Breakfast Bar we decided to try it. The second we walked in we knew we had made a great decision. It smelled amazing already.  My husband had fried chicken and eggs, with biscuits and gravy. The chicken was FRESH, very lightly breaded and fantastic flavor. I had the Bene (Eggs Benedict) and again no complaints. The hollandaise sauce was so delicious I could've had a cup of it, lol. This will definitely be our new Sunday breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service!

They just re-opened after a hiatus.

The decor is modern and functional; everything is clean and well-laid out.

Their 'Classic Burger' is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!! We are visiting from out of town and love to visit local dining establishment... Breakfast Bar totally exceeded our food expectations!!  All I can say is Delicious!!! Bring a full appetite you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I thought we would try this place as the pictures and pricing looked good. Coffee is kind of on the weak side and was minimally warm. However the food was great! Good flavor great portions sizes for the price. Staff is very friendly and attentive without being annoying about it.  We will be back there's so much on the menu that looked great on other people's table."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and very trendy decor!! This place is new and could definitely use your support."}
{"text":"Cool little spot tucked away in the shopping center off of Cheyenne. Quick seating, fast service, got the pancake special and Yolanda's service was on point. Drinks and good exactly as ordered. Decent prices on entrees, they have burgers sandwiches, breakfast, pasta. Open early and close at 3. Definitely will return here, when I'm not making the breakfast of champions myself! Mozzarella sticks on point too, lol! All that's left, in pic, my bad, got carried away! Great service and clean atmosphere, simple, nothing crazy! Go here..."}
{"text":"Their toast and french toast was delicious! Yummy crispy bacon! My husband loved the ham, it was a big slice and very thick! The only thing that was a bit bland were the pancakes! But other than that, food was great and so was the service!"}
{"text":"I visited this place sod on Yelp I was not let down by a long shot I ordered a carry-out but the food was absolutely fantastic nice little place I'm going to go there again great Decor I love the way it looks I was wondering to set the time she was very nice and personable but the food and the portions were absolutely fabulous I had the lovers breakfast which had bacon eggs two sausages one huge portion of ham and hashbrown with toast and pancakes and I couldn't even finish it great little spot definitely a Vegas gem. It has that feel of a great place to go in the morning after a wonderful night."}
{"text":"I'm glad we decided to try this place out! Food and service was great! French fries is a little too crispy for me but overall very good place to eat at. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Omg the food is ahhhmazing! Good prices and beautiful open dining area. It's has a fresh open feel to it and everyone who works here is very friendly. Great with kids :) this is a new regular spot for sure! Come here if you want well priced food to die for with exceptional service. Finally"}
{"text":"It was great food ! I didn't too much care for the hash browns . Other than that i can't complain! I also ordered via GrubHub so my order got delivered to me pretty quickly"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last Sunday and it was really good. The service is super on point and we got our food like 5 minutes after ordering. I got the chicken sandwich and it was really good and the French fries that came with it were also really good. I tried the hash browns and those were really good as well. Would definitely recommend this place! It's cheap and the food is great and they also offer a loyalty card so after I think 10 visits you get like $10 off your next order or something like that."}
{"text":"Great find. Huge omelettes. Solid service. This place is going to be crushing it soon. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Went on a friends recommendation on a Sat   morning. Had to ask for a server to take our order. Had to ask for a coffee refill. Food came out cold. Place was busy but 2 waitresses was not enough. I cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Nice little spot next to Target. Walked in and was greeted immediately and seated. Very roomy and comfortable setting. We felt very welcomed and after a long morning of soccer, we were ready to eat. 

The food was amazing. We had healthy sized portions and we finished every last bit lol. We had planned to go back while there on our trip but unfortunately we never made it back. One day tho... we will."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with my husband and LOVED the food. Fast, speedy and delicious :) I ordered the Cali Mix omelet and it was on point. It was light and fluffy, avocado was PERFECT and while I'm not really I to hash browns these were surprisingly very good and not bland. Will be back again soon, and when we have family in town because this is the right speed for my in-laws who aren't into major chain restaurants."}
{"text":"There is nothing stand-out about this place either way. The food is decent (we had omelets, one with home potatoes and one with hash browns); nothing super exciting. The omelets are pretty big, so you get a decent amount for the money.

The place isn't that big, and was about 2/3 full when we went, and there were 6-7 servers/runners. You might think that would speed up operations, but it seemed to slow things down. We sat near the kitchen pass-through and were privy to all of the confusion. Although unorganized, everyone was nice.

My Cali Mix omelet was supposed to come with avocado, jack cheese, and sausage. I was staring at it weird because I didn't see any avocado. An attentive server noticed my look and came to ask if everything was ok. When I said I thought it was supposed to come with avocado, she said no. I said I was pretty sure the menu said it did (also, it has \"Cali\" in the title, which nearly guarantees it). She went to check and brought me back a side of avocado and apologized. We didn't notice until the end of our meal that my partner never received the rye toast that was to come on the side of his, but we didn't really care as he wasn't necessarily looking forward to a side of toast, and he barely finished half of his omelet as it was (and he can usually finish most meals easily, so that shows you how big those omelets actually are).

Overall, I probably wouldn't ever go back here when I have other better options close by. It wasn't the worst breakfast experience I've ever had, though, by far."}
