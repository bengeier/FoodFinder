{"text":"The food took about 10 minutes but was hot and made fresh. My only complaint would be that the poutine was drowned in gravy and resembled more of a soup."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go when you're in a hurry as it generally takes five to ten minutes to get your food. If you have the time to wait, however, I cannot recommend this place enough! Always fresh and hot and never greasy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken, chips and gravy. One of the best combinations since pb&j. This place opened up recently and I was happy to try it out. Service was friendly, food did take a little to long to come out, but when it did it was hot and tasty with decent portions. Chicken itself was good but not great, its missing some spice, maybe some Cayenne or black pepper. Chips and gravy (or sauce as they call it here) were good also. Its worth a visit but be patient."}
{"text":"Recently opened so they may get better but for now this is the only fast food place I know where you order and it takes 25 mins for your food to be ready. Hope they improve. To be fair, the food was good."}
