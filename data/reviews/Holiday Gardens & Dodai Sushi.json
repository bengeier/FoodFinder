{"text":"Love this place!  The sushi is always excellent (sushi b combo!!). Bulgogi is fantastic. The tempura moriwase, and gyoza. WOW!!  My daughter enjoys the holiday rice and Cantonese lo mein. The hot snd sour soup is not the best I've had but it is certainly worrh it!  The best part they deliver!!!!  The Miso is very good!!"}
{"text":"Discovered Dodai while walking by one day and decided to try them out. My dinner consisted of a combination half Chinese and half Japanese cuisine. Some won ton soup (which I was craving) was quite delicious and plentiful plus I ordered the chicken teriyaki to go. Not bad and the dish came with rice and an eggroll. I'd recommend this restaurant especially if you want to dine in a cozy atmosphere. They've got booths which give you privacy and an intimate setting."}
{"text":"There's nothing I don't like about the place, but also nothing that really stands out. The bbq eel was slightly above average, but the spicy salmon roll barely had any salmon in it...just spice. The pumpkin skin maki also didn't really deserve to be on the menu. The miso soup is really good. The service is good. The atmosphere is a little bit like an old ladys house."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Not the fanciest for dine in, but their take out is to die for! Always fresh and courteous.  They also deliver and are always on time! I am new to the area and so I am happy that I found a sushi place that satisfies my picky taste for Japanese cuisine!"}
