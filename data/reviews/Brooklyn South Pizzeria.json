{"text":"I haven't tried their pizza. I did try a stromboli and didn't care for it. However, their wings are fantastic! They're crispy with just the right amount of spice, or you can get them plain, if you prefer. We go here and order wings and salad for our meal. They're great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It is consistently one of the best places to eat at the lake.  Pizza is great, wings are delish and the pasta is by far better than any place around.  If you have never tried their feta in a salad you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I read a few of the reviews for this place and I know that sometimes a place just has a management issue that is easily fixed.  It seems that Brooklyn South made their necessary changes to produce an excellent experience.  My family and I arrived from Long Island on a late Saturday evening with high hopes.  They definitely delivered.  My kids said the pizza was better than our local brick oven place in our hometown!!  We ordered a regular 16\" pizza and 2 specialty slices which I would have called grandma style.  Lots of sauce, fresh basil and a few small slices of fresh mozzarella.  It is exactly what I love most.  The crust was so thin and crispy that I quickly agreed with my kids that it was better than home and that is saying something!  I am originally from Brooklyn NY and I really thought the pizza was a great comparison to what we can get there.  The sweet tea is growing on me too.  Great job Brooklyn South.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the Lake Norman area. Its huge, hot and always great. The service is good and the overall experience is relaxed and fun. 

For some reason Brooklyn South is way better the Brooklyn Boys in Mooresville even though they the same owner? or family?

Overall awesome!"}
{"text":"Super greasy thick fatty mcfat fat pizza served by inattentive high school kids who text constantly, OMG why would I BRB?? JK LOL!"}
{"text":"Best cannolis around! Great calzone too! I thought the service was great, not sir what the others were talking about!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Charlotte area.  The only local place worthy of any NYC reference in the name."}
{"text":"Good and quick place for lunch - Love the soup!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place like black ppl very well my service was so different than the ppl around me the man sitting n front of me the wait staff kept getting him refills and they never asked me if I want a refill or even if my food was ok and the said part is the food was really good but all because of they way I felt here I will never come back and I will tell other not to go here either worse customer service I have ever experienced"}
{"text":"The food is good but pricey for what you get. That's fine, BUT every single time I order online using their app, something in the order is wrong. There is no quality control check to make sure it is what was ordered, and I end up having to check it myself every time before I leave (I've learned this the hard way) to make sure I receive everything I've paid for and that it is accurate. After about 5-7 instances of this (I'm a sucker for a second chance), I have decided that the only time we will eat the food is at the restaurant so we can more easily double check the accuracy. This likely means we won't be eating this food soon because I can't remember the last time we ate in there. So disappointed and just ticked off."}
{"text":"I love Brooklyns pizza it's by far the best NYC pizza around and the prices are unbeatable! The wait staff is very nice! My favorite waitress is Betty she's awesome always takes good care of me when I come through! As far as the rest of ladies there all nice too and very pretty! I'm so glad I found this place! Best pizza in tha world! Thank you Brooklyns

{"text":"I love Brooklyn South! It's a casual, counter service restaurant. They have local beers on tap at good prices. The food is so fresh and delicious! I recommend the Brooklyn bridge or stuffed chicken pizza. All of their salads and the garlic knots are to die for! Service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here and so do my kids. We're from NY. New Yorkers are super snobby about their pizza. The booths we sat at needed replacing (torn seats) and the staff did not know enough to go grab me a high chair when I asked about them... They just pointed me in the right direction :-/ holding my hungry toddler and all. I also like when a pizzeria will offer to cut smaller slices when you have small children with you. They didn't offer but did cut them small when we asked. The restaurant is very cute with all the NY decor. Anyway, I will go back and recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy lunch or dinner. One of our favorite places to enjoy pizza. Salads and the pasta were really delicious. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. Consistently good quality. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here Friday.  The specials are good option and value.  Two NY slices and drink for $4.50 is hard to beat.

The pizza is very good just wish the slices were bigger, you should have to fold a NY slice to eat it.  I would pay more for larger slices."}
{"text":"This past summer,  Brooklyn South was my go to pizza place on Friday night. Service was good, family friendly and a pretty good pie. Five star worthy. But the last two of our three visits,  the service has been terrible. We waited over an hour for a plain pie after having garlic knots that were underbaked. When my husband asked to speak with the manager, the server told us he was too busy cooking. When we asked the server the first time about our pie, she said, oh sorry, only two more minutes. 15 minutes later, we asked another server who said she would find out what's going on. But then she never came back to our table. My husband then asked a different server for the manager again. Then another server came back to tell us they would give us a credit for our next visit and her apology consisted of, I'm really sorry about you're order, we've been really busy.  Oh and a caveat, the entire time we waited for our pizza not a single person asked if we needed more drinks, napkins or anything.  By the time the pizza arrived, my husband and I were too upset to enjoy our dinner. We used our voucher for a take out order and guess what, they gave us the wrong order. I was too upset to even go through the complaint process. Again. We go to the Brooklyn style pizza place in Mooresville now instead."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Wow! I was just driving through and I was not expecting to get this caliber of Italian food and pizza away from New York. I spoke to the owner it turns out they have a long family history of creating dinning experiences that can't be topped, going all the way back to Italy.  I cannot over recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a snow bird from NY as well and like Erin said \"although its not the exact caliber\" it is still excellent pizza... Bring your patience it can be very busy at times..."}
{"text":"Service wise this place is TERRIBLE 
EVERY TIME u call they put u on hold for a good 5-10 minutes
You think it would be crazy busy but when u pick up ur food and walk in there is ALWAYS 2-3 girls behind the counter not doing anything. Owner OBVIOUSLY doesn't care bc he has a bunch of KIDS basically hanging out at \"work\" all day
Oh yea and take out food is ALWAYS COLD
DO-NOT-RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"great for the family, fast and friendly, wish they served wings, service and girls are fast and friendly. spaghetti and meatballs are great ..."}
{"text":"Brooklyn South is definitely easy to miss as it is tucked away off of Catawba. But, let me assure you that it is worth finding for your next pizza craving. I can't say that I have made a lot of pizzas in my lifetime, but I have eaten a lot of pizzas. Pizza is one of those items that seems very difficult to make incorrectly and yet, I have had trouble finding a good old fashioned cheese pizza in the Lake Norman area. 

Thank goodness for Brooklyn South!

Even though they deliver, I opted for pick-up. I ordered the NY Style pie with extra cheese and half peperoni with an order of mozzarella sticks. 30 minutes later, I was walking in the door to pick up my food. 

The interior of the restaurant was larger than I had expected and would certainly lend itself to a sit down dinner if that is your thing. Personally, I like to eat my pizza while sitting on the couch and watching tv. I know: rebel without a cause...

So, I get home and open the very large box (remember, it's NY style) to a beautifully sauced and cheesed pizza. And it absolutely tasted as good as it looked! I can't speak to their specialty pizzas, but sometimes it's best to stick to the original. In fact, next time, I think I will eliminate the peperoni. The cheese side was more enjoyable. Though, they do have sardines on their menu and I am insanely curious to try them on a pizza... I'll let you know when I do!

The mozzarella sticks were standard and did not come with marinara sauce. But, with pizza this good, there is little need for sides. 

The next time you find yourself craving good old fashioned pizza, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza!! 

It's one of the best NY pizzas around the Charlotte Area. I've been coming here for years and the consistency is always right on! 

I've had the penne a La vodka and found it to be mostly amazing, but on occasion hit or miss."}
{"text":"Its good, maybe but  over rated by brainwashed NY / Philly  transplants. And I am one

They have a Nonna pie that's really good."}
{"text":"walked thru the door at 11:30 am,  They open at 11 am.  The line to get your order was a bit crowded.   Seemed the girls at the register were a little slow on their order taking.  
Ordered Fettuccine Alfredo, and two slices of NY style.  The pizza dough was undercooked, and had zero taste.   I would assume they started their ovens at 10:30 or 10:45 to get things rolling, but this was bad.  I am using my reference of real NY pizza from the city, this didnt cut it.

The Alfredo, pasta under cooked and sauce with zero taste.   

checked with a few friends, and they were surprised, they recommended the place.  Perhaps a weekend or evening would have been a better time to visit."}
{"text":"Brooklyn South had been my favorite pizza place since they originally opened in their first location on the other side of Harris Teeter, however over the years the quality has been sliding a bit.  The last two visits I've had at Brooklyn South have both been awful, this past time I ordered 2 calzones, a greek salad, and 6 garlic knots.  The salad was aright, although it was no more than lettuce and a giant block of feta, but the garlic knots were too greasy to eat, and the calzones were not only tiny, but raw on the inside, and so hard on the outside that you couldn't bite into them.  When I called to explain the problem the girl at the front put me on hold for 10 minutes and then seemed totally unsympathetic about the problem.  I asked her if I could simply get a credit for the calzones, and she seemed put off to have to take down my information.  I most likely won't return, even for the credit."}
{"text":"This pizzeria good has always been above average. However their robust takeout service is always confusing and disorganized.  Given their location it is amazing that they do not accept Amex . Unbelievable. Unfortunately it is not always about the food. It is about the total experience."}
{"text":"No sausage on the \"Brooklyn Bridge\" even though it stated it has it. The stuffed meat lovers pizza fell short of the stuffing."}
{"text":"Food is delish!!  We are Friday night regulars & love this family friendly place!  Yes, it gets busy, yes you have to wait in line to order but tables open up quickly and the staff is always super friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"For a quick meal the place is great, the food does not have much flavor, and the cooks are just that, cooks. there's nothing special about this place. If it was in New York it would've been out of business years ago, but for LKN it's about as good as it gets for Italian food I guess. The taste and quality of the food is a 4 out of 10."}
{"text":"We moved here from New Jersey hoping to find a place that could even come close to the pizza we were accustomed to. We found it here! Their NY classic pie is as close as it gets! This is our regular pizza place that we go to. We have done take out (love their app!) and eaten there. Both are great experiences. We have not tried the entrees yet because we have only gone there for pizza so far. If you are from 'up north' and looking for 'that' pizza- this is the place. Ps. We also like Tony's but this place has better atmosphere and seating,etc."}
{"text":"I was there Thursday nite and had the chicken Parmesan! It was amazing! The staff was very attentive and friendly. The manager was very focused on making sure my experience was top notch and everything was perfect! I highly recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good and service is great. Only reason they didn't get 5 is if you haven't been there before it's a little confusing to order food."}
{"text":"Yikes.  Haven't even gotten our food yet, and we won't be back.  Guy who rang us up was a complete jerk. No greeting, no conversation, just looked at us.  Didn't tell us what pizzas they had. He should NOT be in a customer facing role.  Even if this is the best pizza in the world, we aren't coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in the area! I have found myself ordering from here multiple times a week, stopping in for a slice, or sitting out on the patio for a beer off their tap. This place is truly a hometown feel and the owner takes time to ensure the food is made with the best quality ingredients. Being from NYC I have high expectations and this is the only place I will grab a pizza from. Nonna's pizza is my absolute favorite but you can't go wrong with a cheese slice either. The wings are incredible, nice meaty pieces and great blue cheese as well. 
The staff is very welcoming and friendly and a nice touch is that they open up the to-go containers in front of you to ensure there is no mistake before walking out the door.
I would recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza. My wife loved the pepperoni! I always get drawn into getting something new, and had the Milano pizza of the day, which was good, but not quite as good as my expectations. Cute atmosphere, but not very NY, though the presence of Brooklyn Brewing beers was a nice touch. Friendly and accommodating staff! Would definitely eat here again, and look forward to trying some of the other pizzas they offer!"}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed eating at this Pizzeria over the years. I've visited Brooklyn South several times with"}
{"text":"This place was bad. No other way to put it. Just plain bad. The service was non-existent. The staff seemed annoyed that I wanted a paper plate with my pizza. You have to get up to order drinks at the front for some reason. The guy who brought our pizza out was completely confused about which table ordered what pizza. Save yourself a headache and just don't go. I'd recommend Papa Johns pizza before this place."}
{"text":"Another pizza joint with ties to New York.
This particular one sets itself apart for me by way of its calzones!
I order some combination of ricotta, mozzarella, ground beef, tomatoes and black olives virtually every time, and it never disappoints!

I have had pizza there as well, and it is good, though not quite as memorable as the calzones.

While I often choose to get take-out, the interior is a comfortable place to dine in. A stone fireplace bisects the dining area, and a large brick patio is available as well.

Just sitting here typing about this is making me hungry. If you like pizza and Italian food, definitely worth a go!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a better rating except for the Service

Over the past couple of weeks, we've had several occassions where all five grandchildren were at our house along with the parents.  They range in age from 6 to 10 so you can imagine how picky they can be at that age.

Pizza is a good option and Brooklyn South does a great job of preparing pizza's that are half this, half that and other other topping on the side.  The only thing that does not get customized is the garlic knots.

The pizza is nice and chewy with a good yeast flavor. Plenty of cheese and they don't skimp on the other toppings.

Only negative comments are on service.  Front counter is staffed by a group of young people working summer break with no idea what customer service is.  They are prone to walking away from the counter and leaving you hanging there.  They are also prone to give incomplete or incorrect information when you order over the phone.

At the same time, if they tell you that it will be 30 minutes, figure on 45 minutes even if the restaurant has just opened and it's mostly empty.

Outsife of service, they produce a good product at a good value."}
{"text":"Why am I giving them another Chance???  Yesterday I got the \"Brooklyn Bomber\" which is supposed to be similar to an Italian Sub!  It BOMBED with ease!  This was my second one though my first was a while back I figured it had to have gotten better with the other two Italian Delis close by they have to be competitive right???  Wait this is a Pizza Place so should I consider this?  You can! !! !!! 

The Balsamic Vinegar was Very Good 4 yelp stars

The Bread filled me up, which is good because the Meat and Cheese were the Bare minimum in Volume and Flavor!!! The bread had very little flavor as well though it had Great Volume and density!  Overall the Food is Lacking Flavor and Value!

The Service was fine!  This place is well suited for Families with young Children!  So it is good that you have a mostly teenage staff (better Referees) The Pizza (not my preference either)... Buying a Whole pie is better than the Reheated slices!"}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza often, but when I do, I go to Brooklyn South up off of exit 28 in Cornelius. It is true NY style with hoagies and pasta dishes and all that Italian Jazz, but my go to is the totally unique and on my \"best things Ive even ate\" Grandpa's Pizza. This thing is a mouthgasm of flavor. Served Sicilian style, but thinner crust, mozzarella first and then ladled with homemade sauce that is the nice balance of chunky tomato and basil, and then topped with caramelized onions and homemade bread crumbs.......try this pizza, seriously."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  

If you're looking for great NY style pizza - look not further
If you're looking for a great Calzone - this is the place to be
If you're looking for gourmet pizza - Oh yeah - they do that too
And a whole lot more.

I eat here for lunch at least twice a week and never get tired of it.  The food is awesome and they have plenty of options to mix it up.

The people here are great too.  They are quick to help and are always smiling.  

The only complaint I could ever have is that sometimes there is a long line, but that only happens every once in a while and in the end it's worth the wait.  

If you haven't been to Brooklyn South - GO!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Pie by the slice for lunch is a great option. The spaghetti with meatballs is great as is the chicken parm. Garlic knots are addicting, very tasty. This is a great place to host a group, they have a back room that seats 40+ and the pricing is excellent. Betty runs the parties and she is great to work with, event went off without a hitch even after having to reschedule around the weather."}
{"text":"While they are a bit pricey for pizza, you get what you pay for.  We have only ordered to-go so far and have been very pleased with the pizza.  Deep dish comes heavy with sauce so the extra cheese really helps.  All the ingredients taste fresh and top quality.  If you like garlic knots I would pass on theirs as they are more itialian herbs than garlic.   After about 6 orders to-go I guess you could say I'm a fan   I'll be back."}
{"text":"This pizza place is probably one of the best around town but the only thing that is lacking is the service. I go a couple times a month and every time the service is sub par. A few months ago I went with my granddaughter and we sat for only a few minutes until this nice young man came and talked to us and he had told us that the order was going to take a little longer than expected but we were ok with that. We waited for our food and once it came out he immediately brought it out to us and told us to enjoy. The young man was very much accommodating to our every request, He even had a quick conversation with my granddaughter about her shirt. He was the type of server we wished we had every time. We came back last week to see our new favorite server but sadly he was no longer there we were told. We hope that he will be there next time because he was the whole reason my granddaughter wanted to go. I hope this restaurant hasn't gotten rid of one of their best employees. It was because of him we used to come regularly. Now the rest of the service is sub par."}
{"text":"I've ordered carryout a few times from this location. Service is good, but the pizza is just \"OK\"- not great."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza, hands down. Customer service is superb. Menu offers something for even the pickiest eaters."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area & received a welcome packet in the mail & had a free pizza offer from here. We added pepperoni & sausage... this is the 3rd pizza place we've tried around here & it's by far the best. Definitely trying their wings next, the people beside us ordered them & they smelled amazing!
Very nice staff & I loved that their sweet tea tastes like sun tea. Took me back to my childhood days:)

EDIT-- We come once weekly now & Wings are awesome:)"}
{"text":"I didn't have a taste for anything and we drove by so we decided to stop. Great hot wings and NY pizza by the slice. One of the best pizza slices I've had in the Lake Norman area. Wait staff is friendly and very attentive. It's counter service but once you're seated you don't have to worry about getting up for anything else. Local beers on tap. You can watch pizza being made from your seat. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Best calzone ever; so cheesy, garlicky, gooey, tasty, yummy and the dough was just right too. The pasta primavera was tasty with plenty of fresh vegetables   
BTW this was take out"}
{"text":"best pizza in the lake norman area!!! you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the CLT area. Lots of toppings, great crust. Being from NY I've been looking for a great pizza and this is definitely it!"}
{"text":"I will never order from Brooklyn after my experience today. I have enjoyed their pizza the last few years a bit pricey but will pay more if it's worth it. I called to place an order and  went to pick it up only to find out they did not have my order. She asked what number I called and I read it from my phone which the young lady confirmed it was the right number. She asked who I spoke with and I said a woman. Being in sales if their was an error on my part I would ask what I could do to rectify it so they could give me another opportunity to show that one time would not happen again. Not once was I offered anything just I'm sorry. I told the young lady that I will never come back. I suggest when your restaurant is busy that your employees are properly trained for busier times since they look overwhelmed today."}
{"text":"In town to visit my brother with family and he recommended this place for good Pizza on a Friday night as my dad is from the Bronx and loves NY style Pizza. We ordered two large pizzas, one cheese and one with 3 toppings, a Caesar salad, and a chicken cutlet sandwich.

Needless to say this was probably the worst Pizza we've ever had! The crust was harder than cardboard, the sandwich was mush and could not eat it without making a mess and they would've  forgotten the salad dressing if we didn't ask for it. 
So disappointed and barely edible.  My father just picked off the cheese and ate the toppings because the crust was so hard.

My brother said the pizza is normally better but needless to say he no longer gets to recommend dinner even though he is the only one from the area."}
{"text":"Love this place....If you are looking for good NY pizza, this is the closest you're going to get!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 8 years, and this is one of my favorite lunch places in Charlotte and surrounding.
I grew up in a heavily populated Italian community up north, and this place has very similar characteristics of those pizza joints.  Lots of variety and consistent.  Soups are my favorite, and pizza is great too.  
Some of he reviews are dogging the service and quality, but that's silly into opinion.  Whether you like the flavor or not, they don't use cheap ingredients. 
Foods fresh at a great price.  Several lunch specials available for $5.
Staple in Cornelius."}
{"text":"The pizza was good when they got the order correct but after just three times having to call and complain because they gave me the wrong order they said I was not allowed to come back. Wth? I must have bought over 20 pizzas from them an they messed the order up! I would not recommend this place to anyone due to the short temper of the owner and the horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Great place...great service...great food! We plan work lunch here from time to time and never have to worry about going over our time break! This is a restaurant that gets it right! People are friendly and helpful! Location could be better...little hard to find because it's tucked back in off the main road but worth it when you find it! 
Must try the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"We love this place with one caveat. The girls at the counter rock. The boys are dumb as dirt."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas and some garlic knots using the chowhound site at 11:30 am to be picked up at 5pm. I get there at 5 and my pizzas are not ready. The cashier tells me it will be a couple minutes.  I wait for 15 minutes and then ask what's going on. They never even started my pizzas until I got there to pick them up. I waited for almost 30 mins for my food that was supposed to be ready at 5. The lady said they thought it said 6, not 5 but it was clearly a 5. Idk why they didn't just tell me that from the start. Very annoying to think your going to swing in someplace and pick something up and it's not even started. The lady that seemed to be a manager, just said \"sorry\" and shrugged. If you cannot take simple web orders, then DONT!! Done with them."}
{"text":"To my surprise they are not ready in a NY minute.  Placed order at 4:30 online for a 6:15 pick up.  Imagine the surprise to arrive at 6:10 and nothing was started.  Moving from NY 3 years ago I accepted the fact would not find the same caliber of pizza.  Overall my experience with Brooklyn has nt been positive from a quality standpoint and service is terrible.  I will no longer give them a chance."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat as a result of the reviews.
Defiantly thin pizza dough - as advertised NY style pizza. The sausage was sliced so thin - initially I thought it was bacon.
All in all the pizza was good. 
Even though we ordered our food at the counter and the food was delivered we were not forgotten after the food was delivered.
The staff members were very attentive!  Frequently checking in to make sure the food was good and that we had everything we needed.
We shared a large cannoli for desert! Delicious and fresh! 
This is a very casual eatery! 
Be prepared to eat with plastic through away dinnerware and paper plates."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their pizza!! So good, crust is amazing! Salads are very good, if you get them togo, they're on the small side. But overall great place families to go any night of the week!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very casual and is great to stop in and grab a pie with the family.  I have only tried the pizza so I cannot comment on any other food.  There pie is very authentic and they do a good job. I usually stop in when I am up by the lake.  I would recommend it over other places up that way."}
{"text":"We have been to Brooklyn South several times and have never been disappointed in their pizza.  If that is all you're going for you will not be disappointed.  The crusts are really very good.  If you happen to be going and you're not in the mood for pizza but your family is, you may find yourself disappointed by their other offerings.  I have tried different sandwiches on the menu and have found them very underwhelming each time.  Pizza = AWESOME.  Everything else= Not so much.  If they only had pizza on the menu I'd happily give them 5-stars."}
{"text":"I've written a positive reviews before because their pizza is without compare in the North Charlotte / LKN area.

This review is based on their substandard level of service. Please understand that this restaurant is located at the mouth of a river of money called Jetton Road. The standards of service should be high but not here. 

The yoga pant clad debutants that staff this restaurant run the range from inept to purely apathetic about their job. They do not bother to time food delivery, don't bring utensils, and seem to time their table checks right after their compatriots have taken care of the customers needs.

When your staff matches your pizza, I will adjust my next review accordingly."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE MANAGER ON 6/29/18. For the record, it literally breaks my heart to write this review. my family LOVES Brooklyn South! Literally one of the only places my toddler will sit still and devour an entire meal happily in our town!

HOWEVER, with that being said... we will no longer support or visit this establishment until further action is taken against a female manager that worked today around 1 pm to 3 pm. I work as a teacher at a nearby school that has utilized Brooklyn South for many catering and private events.... Not to mention, almost all of the families at our school are also frequent patrons. I was informed by a colleague of mine that they were denied water when her daughter nearly suffered a heat stroke this afternoon (FYI her daughter is 13). My colleague and her daughter went on a walk/jog during her lunch break and like myself have always had nothing but positive experiences at this establishment, so they figured they would stop in and see if she could catch her breathe and get some water. Not only was she denied by this woman, but when her mother called to speak with a manager..... the woman informed her that she was in -fact the manager and the same woman she had spoken to a mere hour earlier. Keep in mind, my colleague did not have her wallet on her because our school is within less than a 3 mile radius of Brooklyn South. She even offered to come back and pay for the water when she could obtain her wallet! Again, we are not talking about bottled water.... we are talking about tap water here.

This manager could not believe that someone would go our for a walk/job without their wallet. NO ONE EXERCISES OUTSIDE WITH A PURSE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD (ummm especially on a 90 degree day).

Common courtesy is a dying thing in this country and I understand that people take advantage of the system often, but denying someone who is suffering one SINGULAR cup of water is inhumane and absurd. I am not only outraged but honestly, disheartened. 

I will continue to spread the word about this establishment and  be appealing this matter to a relative of mine that works for the ACLU unless further action is taken. I am not asking for someone to be fired here, but at the very least a policy change and some compassion. I implore all of you to consider this in the future before choosing to eat here."}

{"text":"I went to Brooklyn South Pizzeria this past weekend because I really enjoyed it the first time I went. This place must be hit or miss because it was not good at all the second time. I think the girl behind the counter just smoked a doob because she forgot to place our order and didn't remember to fix us our drinks. After calling in our order and waiting 15 minutes before we went to pick it up, we got there and contiued to wait for another 25 minutes. It was pretty ridiculous considering it was a Sunday and there wasn't that many people there. When I finally got home and was ready to enjoy this pizza we waited forever for it turned out to be really greasy and the dough wasn't even cooked all the way. Needless to say I'm pretty disappointed with my second visit here. I doubt I'll be back for a while as it was an extremely poor experience which wasted my time and money."}

{"text":"Best pizza in town. If you disagree, then you have probably never eaten here. Either that or you're the type of person who thinks Papa Jersey John's is amazing."}
{"text":"best pizza in the usa hands down!!! i have eaten pizza from ny to ak to hi and never had better and yhe folks that work there are tops!!!"}
{"text":"Brooklyn South has become a Cornelius mainstay for pizza.  Then again, any place in Cornelius older than 1yr is a mainstay.

Atmosphere- Open.  Kind of like a skilodge, due to the fireplace in the center of the restaurant.  The place also has a nice, tree lined, outdoor eating area w/ enough trees to have you forget that you are near a busy road.

Service - I have been here a few times but last night I realized how odd the order setup process is to me.  I guess maybe it is normal to go to a counter, order, take your street sign (g/f did the carrying...I am not carrying a street sign) to your table and wait for the server to bring your food.  I do not know but for how nice the inside is you think it would be a little more wait staff oriented.

Food - Great!  I think they have the tastiest pizza south of the Mason Dixon line.  We ordered the NY Style, big thin slices, we had topped w/mushrooms, pepperoni and black olives.  We also got side salads w/ romaine lettuce, tomato, carrot and onion.  I normally get the Sicilian Style because I think it is even better than the NY Style (I like the thick, bread like crust).  The sauce on both styles has a pleasant mild spicy flavor that is slightly salty w/sections of tomatoes giving the sauce a nice texture. 

Overall - I really enjoy Brooklyn South as it is the most Northern style pizza place that I have found in the New South."}
{"text":"We have tried this place three times, with high hopes of finding a good pizza close to home.  But each time the same disappointment. A soggy, flat, skimpy on the toppings, barely cooked pizza and $60 for two pies and drinks on paper plates, for a family of three.  No more, no more, no more-
We gladly pay to have a \"good\" meal out but this place won't be taking in any more of our hard earned income."}
{"text":"First time around ordering takeout from her. Not disappointed at all, pizza was fresh and wings were ON! Got the Brooklyn special with no regrets. Happy to find out this place is legit because there are a few places that have \"school pizza\" in Cornelius and have the nerve to charge more than 1.50! Pleasant surprise to finally find a place for the pizza night! Customer service was on point and food was too! If you in the area, don't bother with the imposters, you won't be disappointed! Can't wait to try more items from the menu on next pizza nite!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the reviews on here make me laugh. \"I'm from NY and only New Yorkers know pizza\"...

Well, I'm from NY, but I'm not the pizza snob that New Yorkers typically are. The pizza here is very well prepared, it tastes great (try the Nona), and everything tastes FRESH!

The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that I don't like the process of waiting in line to order. It's fine, but I like having a server come to the table."}
{"text":"The Zucchini fries appetizer was great as were the ciabatta meatball sliders. I highly recommend both. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo as my main course. It was slightly tasteless and the pasta was over cooked. The chicken that comes with the dish was very rubbery. 

The bread was fresh, however everybody hates it when a restaurant gives you butter packets that have been chilled all day and are as hard as a rock. How are you supposed to spread frozen butter on your fresh bread? Cmon people. 

The staff was very friendly and kind to us. I would go back due to the friendly staff and management and the appetizers were great. Although next time I won't order chicken fettuccine Alfredo."}
{"text":"I thought this stop deserved a new update. The food was spot on. The soup tasted like home made and the pizza was nice and crispy.  I think the said the soup was wedding soup but its tasted more like pasta vegetable with meat soup, but whatever it was it was great. Glad they have outdoor seating so we can stop with our pup. Well done. Plus the staff is now a good mix of nice  kids.Well done Brooklyn South , Well done.

{"text":"Went in tonight for a sausage, eggplant and ricotta pizza, came out very disappointed. Waited for about 20mins in line just to get to counter after already waiting 30mins at home. Almost an hour in at this point. When they revealed my pizza before leaving, it looked like a big pile of crap dumped onto my pizza. Worker said it was the ricotta, looked more like a bunch of ranch squirted all over the pizza. Ricotta does not look like a liquid, especially since I've had it there before. The employee went back and forth with the pizza maker claiming it's just very melted ricotta. Manager, a young blonde girl, then got involved and again said it was melted ricotta. Um honey have you had lasagna before? It doesn't melt to a complete liquid like this. One of the young guys working there even came over and said he wasn't sure what they served me. Then she responded that she can make a new one but it will be another 35-40mins....excuse me??? Then she offered just a simple cheese pizza as that's all they had available and only refunded for the toppings. Really they should have refunded the whole thing since I couldn't even get what I ordered! On top of this I had a Greek salad too, omg do not order the pathetic Greek salad which consists of one olive and one cucumber with tasteless dressing and wilted lettuce. Really liked coming here, but this will be the last overpriced pizza I ever get from here"}
{"text":"Brooklyn South is a bit of an enigma to me. Their Italian dishes, like lasagna or chicken parmesan are generally pretty good but not stellar. The pizzas are SO hit or miss. When they are hit they are really good with crisp crust, good sauce and cheese but when they are miss, and they too often are, you wind up with a soggy in the center pos. 

Still, for a quick, close to home, relatively inexpensive way to meet an Italian food craving, Brooklyn South fits the bill. Just have the pizza stone ready at home in case you get a soggy one to go!"}
