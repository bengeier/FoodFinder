{"text":"Great cozy place to enjoy some awesome sushi. If you are ever in the East end, you really need to try this place. The service is excellent and the food is great! The house specialities are really good, you have to try the dragon soul. Be sure to stop by and try, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, excellent presentation, and great sushi. There may be better sushi in other places but we'd be hard pressed to tell you where to find it. This is the whole package, if a little out of the way. It's a bit of a destination spot. This place is on fleek, try the \"lips\". We byob'd sake and they heated it for us, excellent service."}
{"text":"My first time at Nippori got here for the birthday of my sister she was preaching about the quality of the food and service and i agree with her! It's a BYOB \"bring your own booze\" (wine) restaurant that's a big plus! I ordered the Wakame salad, The Volcano (kind of huge popcorn scallops) it's accompanied with fine slices mangoes,cucumbers,carrots salad flourish with a beautiful flower that you can eat and the sauce is sweet and salty it's perfection! I got the Dragon Soul Sushi (6 pieces) and the roll was absolutely fantastic and delicious! This is a good place for a big group or a intimate place to bring your date! I would definitely come back! 5 stars!"}
