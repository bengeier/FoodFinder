{"text":"Great tucked away, hole in the wall, Thai restaurant! Was a bit skeptical based on the location and outside appearance; however, so thankful I tried it anyways! Great Pad Thai & Drunken noodles! Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"A tiny place with amazing food!! Flew in from CA hungry and stumbled onto Chanpen. Oh happy day! Delicious!!!! Wonderful service too!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Great food! The Red curry was very tasty.  The service was good.  Loved the complimentary dessert."}
{"text":"Everything I eat at this place is great. The food  is always fresh. The complimentary green tea ice cream while you wait is the life."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food we've had in the states. It's comparable to the food we had in Thailand. It's authentic, delicious, the portions are generous, and it won't break the bank. We had the coconut soup w/chicken, green curry with veggies, and chick panang curry, all level 3 heat. We could have gone higher, but 3 gives some good heat without distracting from the flavor.  Lots of veggies and lots of leftovers. It's a charming little place and I'd highly recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever, and for a reasonable price!!! I always get spicy crispy chicken and garlic chicken all with rice which never fails to satisfy!"}
{"text":"DON'T order  sea food hot pot. Really disappointed. Two shrimps,two clams, couple fish chunks and a whole pot water with mushrooms. It wasn't worth $14.99. I would like to order noodles if I knew it."}
{"text":"Took a trip one afternoon for lunch with my wife. It's a small place & parking lot very small also. We arrived inside & seated ourselves as they looked extremely busy. It took awhile to get someone to take our order. Once they have it almost took almost 45 minutes for our meals to arrive. I was trying to enjoy my lunch but the booth had beaten backrest which some portions were covered in duct tape. When someone on the opposite side of the booth sat back, it push you forward which felt the backrest would eventually break. The food was ok. Nothing to rave about. The fresh rolls looked brown and dingy which we didn't finish. I'm a huge fan of Thai Food but felt this place fell short of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is good.   Good lunch specials.   When they ask you 1-5 spicy deduct one from what you think you are capable of.   Bonus ice cream at dinner."}
{"text":"Our coconut soup and massaman curry were absolutely delicious! The coconut pineapple ice cream was unexpected and a very nice touch to finish the meal. The staff were all very gracious and prompt."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about these guys!  The service is SUPER friendly and the food is great too!  All of the reviews are right - Chanpen knows how to make good food."}
{"text":"Great experience and excellent curry. My wife had pineapple curry, I ordered panang curry both with chicken. Free ice cream at the end was a nice touch. Be careful though with the 1-5 spice scale. Order a little lower than you are used to. My friend ordered a 2 spice and thought he'd swallowed the sun. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"***second location now open on 48th street and Baseline road.  Lots of dining space and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Great food with friendly service!  My husband and I saw this restaurant last week and decided to give it a try. The looks outside seems deceiving but oh.. once you tasted the food, it is delicious. The place is small but hey we're there for food, so not a big deal for us. By the way, one order of food is enough for two people."}
{"text":"Best damn Thai food in Phoenix. And I come from vegas - one of the food capitals of the nation. This is one of the few places that serves you homemade spring rolls and they are very generous with their portions. And when u ask for spicy they give u SPICY!"}
{"text":"Don't let the looks of this place keep you from coming. The food is GREAT!! Had the vegetarian pad thai, thai hot. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty however the lunch portion was pretty small. The location is shady."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful staff. The only thing that's difficult about coming here is what to get... So many delicious choices. My personal favorite is red curry or spicy fried rice and of course their famous Thai tea on the side. And for dessert sweet sticky rice! Yum!! Their prices are amazing and service is so quick! There aren't many places to sit so it's best to come early or be prepared to wait but they're worth the wait! They always offer take out so you can enjoy their wonderful food from the comfort of your home or work."}
{"text":"I judge all other Pad Thai by Chan Pen's. I haven't found any I like better anywhere. They are always generous with water and friendly service. I take out more than enough eat in, and my order is always ready when promised"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30 am for lunch during a weekday--already a line.  We lucked out and got a booth.  I had the pad thai lunch special and my friend had the drunken noodle special.  We both loved what we had.  The service is good--those guys work so hard!  They are constantly on the run serving everyone.  They need a bigger space with a decent parking lot."}
{"text":"Ok this place is really,  really a whole in the wall, it also has the BEST Pad Thai I have ever had in my life, also the Curry was outstanding, I asked for level 2 heat on a scale of 0-5, their level 2 is a lot hotter than my level 2 so be warned if you want mild go with 0 or 1. I also had the Thai vegetables spring rolls they were outstanding try them you will not make a mistake. There is very little air conditioning in the place so be advised during the heat of the day it can be hot in the dining room. The people who cook and run the restaurant are very nice, over all it was a very nice experience, I would go again."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! I've been to quite a few Thai restaurants because I absolutely love Thai, but this was definitely one of my favorites! My mom and I got the chicken sa-tay appetizer. I loved the peanut sauce on the side. For my meal, I got the Spicy Fried Rice with chicken. It was delicious! My mom had the Pineapple fried rice which she loved as well. After dinner, they brought us each a small bowl of coconut ice cream, which I love! I had no idea it was included in the meal. It was the perfect size and perfect timing on the waiter's part. Speaking of, the service was great as well. Our server was friendly and checked on us frequently. Overall, it was a great experience, great food, and a good price. I will definitely go back with my husband sometime."}
{"text":"Great food, Reasonable price, and Good service!  My favorite dishes; PadThai, Spicy Noodle, Yellow curry, and Lemongrass soup. I will definitely be back and try some more :-)  I love thai tea here. Rich and strong flavor also not too sweet, just perfect! My friend tried thai coffee, she said it was good too. I don't have a chance to try their desserts yet. Maybe next time I will save some room for mango sticky rice and green tea ice cream. Umm! Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"The name has changed but I still say that the food is great. My boyfriend whose originally from Thailand said that he was surprised just how authentic the food was. The waitress was sweet and the food came rather quickly. I had the Panang Curry while he had the spicy catfish. Quite possibly  the best thing about it is the price, very cheap."}
{"text":"So glad this place is on Yelp. I had the Sweet Tahi Basil chicken at a 3 hotness. Great taste to it with perfect mix of veg. Great sweet taste. Complementary ice cream at the end was a nice surprise as well. It was exactly what I was looking for. It's a great little treat in the middle of nowhere. Very unassuming from the outside. This hole in the wall comes furnished with a secrion of small tables and a couple booths. Decorated with Muay Thai and Thailand posters and little odds and ends."}
{"text":"Papaya salad was NOT good at all. Dont waste your time. However the panang curry with vegetables, drunken noodles tofu with vegetables and the vegetarian pad thai were pretty tasty and what we ordered for the night. Panang had a nice balance between the curry, coconut and peantuts. It was not soupy but pretty thick. Just enough heat. The drunken noodles had a good flavor and they fry their tofu before they put it in the meals. Fresh vegetables including peppers, broccoli, cabbage and carrots....very generous with the amount of veggies and sprouts. A 4 was plenty of heat ranging from a 1-5 with 5 being thai hot....  We even got a scoop coconut ice cream at the end of our meal....  Restaurant had plenty of booths and tables, not crowded at all and weight time was minimal!!!  Not the best, but definitely not the worst either."}
{"text":"Great Family owned Thai Food place !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic Thai food!!!  We went there for lunch. Twice, during our visit to Phoenix, AZ.  We found this place through Yelp. Thank you Yelpers!  Its a small restaurant in a questionable neighborhood (leave your crown jewels at home). Our server was welcoming, friendly, and very helpful.  She helped me choose my level of spicy for my vegetable stir friend noodles.  Picked level 3.  It was spicy enough to experience tingling burning sensation around the lips, but still able to appreciate the natural flavors and fragrance from the chili peppers.    The noodle soup had a nice flavoring. You could taste the fresh cilantro, anise, sweet cabbages, lemon grass, and whole other goodness. Its the REAL deal. No bouillon or MSG or Knorr seasoning.   Fried Toasts were made differently here.  No complaints from me.  Light n' Crispy panko coating.  Great alone or with the sauce.  Sliced mango over sticky rice drizzled with coconut milk.  YUMMY.  Just look at the pix!   The server and cook/owner treated us like family.  Felt like we were at home eating mom's cooking.    Generous portion and reasonable price.  Plus, they play movies during lunch time.   Great food at a reasonable price + cool movies on dvd (got to watch Sky Fall and Avengers) = What more could you ask for?  Cheers to GREAT Thai Food in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Very good! Best Satay, red curry, mango sticky rice, and coconut ice cream :)"}
{"text":"This place is a true neighborhood gem.  The food is fantastic, and while the decor is not fancy we still find it romantic.  The service is also great, fast and friendly.  It almost feels like we're dining in someone's home in Thailand.  It always hits the spot when we're craving Thai.  Our usual favorites are the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and beef panang curry."}
{"text":"Great spot off the beaten path small but cozy tables in the dining hall and it looks like they have daily specials everything tastes very fresh and the service was great. I would come back again...."}
{"text":"Great new place in the area. We were staying at Arizona Grand Resort and wanted a place that was close by. Food was delicious and service was great. Yellow curry was delicious, the pad see ewe was awesome. The Thai ice coffee and potstickers did not disappoint. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The yellow curry is my favorite. My coworkers and I get lunch here every thursday and its the highlight of our day. Thai thursday is the best!"}
{"text":"Super fresh and unique specials. I ordered the mango delight with tofu. Mango was so soft and sweet. Friend got the avocado green curry, which was also amazing. Don't let the look from the outside scare you away, it's great!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My husband & I tried it for the first time tonight & it was amazing! Great customer service as well"}
{"text":"Incredible Thai food. Nice people. They offered my wife and I a free bowl of coconut soup as we were debating on tum yum kong. So we ended having both Along with the drunken noodles. Then they served us complimentary green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"I visited Chanpen on a Sunday around noon. Despite their being a few large parties in their small restaurant, I received some of the best service I have ever had at this  kind of restaurant. It was unexpected, and nice. The food was good. The atmosphere needs a little work, so know you are going for the service and food if you visit.  They have great weekday specials, and brought me a free fried banana as a gift for visiting. I drank five glasses of water (I requested my food very spicy), and each time, the glass was promptly refilled. I will be back!"}
{"text":"DON'T DO IT! Food is good, but service is horrible.  ESPECIALLY DON'T DO PICK UP.  After waiting 20 minutes longer than we were told and they wouldn't give us a refund, we got our food after AN HOUR.  We WERE regulars but will make the extra trek to Wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"Great authentic food at great prices! Service is fast and friendly. Small place. Crowded when busy. Go early."}
{"text":"OMG this food is to die for....I moan all the way thru this meal. I will come here again again and again. I had the coconut soup, shimp pad Thai, vegetable egg rolls & yellow curry! Nice big sizes!"}
{"text":"This place is so small but the food is absolutely amazing! Best Thai I've had in Phoenix. Great people and service. Get there early to avoid a large crowd or call ahead and take it home. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was great and had to go there 2x's with my family. When you pull up to the restaurant , you will think no way. Go in and have a great meal,that is fresh... Enjoy"}
{"text":"In town for business and noticed this place had good reviews, so thought I would give it a try. Great pad Thai! One of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick dinner traveling through Phoenix tonight! Great Thai rolls, tea, pad Thai and curry. They offered a bowl of Thai ice cream as a perfect finish. We enjoyed the decor and especially the staff who were eager to make our meal special!  We'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend if you are looking for some authentic home cooked food and great prices.  Got in right from the airport, they were open and served delicious. Pineapple Green Curry, Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai.  They gave us complimentary green tea ice cream too.  Very friendly and close to the airport.  Probably great for take out too!"}
{"text":"I really like having a local Thai place in my neighborhood. Tonight I called to place a take out order (probably my 15th time doing so) I actually live right at the baseline location and when I went to pick up my order I discovered that I had accidentally called the wrong location. I felt awful for making the other restaurant (Broadway) make my food and called them to let them know that I wouldn't be able to pick it up and I wanted to apologize. The way I was treated on the phone (the woman was obviously annoyed and told me that \"this once\" I could \"get away with it\" but I better make sure to call the right restaurant next time) made me completely lost my appetite for both locations. She literally hung up on me. Hopefully this message reaches a manager because I wasn't given the option to speak to one. I really wanted to apologize but now I just feel like I never want to go back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food in the area. The fresh spring rolls and red curry are awesome. I was too full to try the green tea ice cream but I definitely will next time. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"It is really difficult to find a Thai place in Phoenix that can compare to this. The food is so full of flavor and appeals to all with pallets  ! My husband loves spicy and I prefer mild and sweet. We both found what we like.  When we first stopped by we were skeptical  , but now  absolutely adore this place."}
{"text":"food is good but service kind of sucks takes forever for togo they really need to make this place bigger....I cant squeeze in to get my food sometimes"}
{"text":"We love this place! It is one of our must stops when we are in Phoenix. The locations couldn't be more different! We love them both. And the food is so so good. We love the satay tofu and always get a curry. 3/5 spice is pretty spicy! We also get the Pad See Ew. Great dishes, consistent quality. Very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. This customer service is impeccable, the guy was sooooo nice it almost didn't matter what the food taste like. I will come back here every single time I'm in Phoenix. Mmmm mmm good."}
{"text":"Had a team dinner here 2 weeks ago. The food was decent and since it's the closest Thai restaurant to me, very convenient.   Appetizers: Angel wings-- fried chicken drumsticks stuffed with noodles and spices. Fried tofu -- just exactly like it sounds, crispy fried tofu served with a sweet fish sauce dip. Tom kha soup-- spicy lemongrass broth with mushrooms, chicken, and carrots.   Mains: eggplant dish with chicken-- okay, served with a basic brown sauce. Pad thai-- too sweet and saucy for my taste. Panang curry-- I enjoyed this but we ordered this with chicken and I personally think it tastes better with beef."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good Thai food. We searched and came across this place. It's a hole on the wall but had good ratings so we tried it. The place is a bit small and a little tight which can get really crowded too. But the food was delicious. They definitely were not stingy on the seasoning. The tom ka kai soup(coconut soup) only had mushroom as a vegetable and maybe a little thicker base but had flavor. The regular chicken fried rice also did not come with any veggies, just eggs and a choice of meat but it was still good. Our favorite was the drunken noodles it was delicious, you can taste different flavors and basil but where it's not too strong. Definitely recommend this place, and hopefully come back soon."}
{"text":"So good! Had no idea that this place even existed until 2 months back! So hooked to it now that I have been ordering take-out every week! Tried their red and yellow curry, drunke noodles and pad thai so far! The curries are soooo good! Drunked noodles are really good too! My only comment is that their lunch special take-outs are really small portions :("}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food!!! We are pilots and love this place!!! We ordered the coconut soup, chicken curry and beef entree. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place has it all...great food and great prices...favorite lunch special is red curry w chicken and iced tea...  Only thing they should do differently...get a bigger restaurant location to accommodate more people...  This is a rare find in a dodgy part of PHX...but completely worth it."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the outside fool you.  The food here is very good.  Now the interior is very tiny so I would suggest getting there before the lunch crowd.  Otherwise, seating may not be available.  Definitely a place to revisit when I'm on that side of town"}
{"text":"I eat Thai food at least once a week and I've been to Thailand for weeks at a time and I love Chanpen. It's the real deal. The Tom Yom soup is amazingly flavorful and spicy as all hell. Sooo good! Chanpen's noodle dishes are so tasty. Whenever I visit Phoenix from NYC I try to make a stop at Chanpen. Iced coffee is really good too."}
{"text":"My parents and I found this place last week - August 17th. The food tasted great - I got a pad Thai, my parents got a vegetable dish with duck and a cashew dish with all the different meats. We decided to get something to go for my husband, we got him masaman beef curry, since the food was good. We saw flies flying around when we were about to leave, we just shrugged it off (bad idea)!!!  Fast forward to that night was probably the worst night in my house. My husband and my mom was vomiting all night long, while me and my dad just had to use the bathroom a lot. My mom also had a fever the following day. We can't even talk about eating any thai food to this day. Never again!"}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing. The only downside is the size of the locale as it can get full fast with people ordering and waiting for their takeout. Otherwise, it's amazing and deserves the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, clean establishment and the food was excellent. I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the sea food hot pot and both were delicious. Great find and I am sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Was disappointed. Have been there a number of times and always had a good experience; the last couple of times have only been mediocre. This last time 3 of us Drunken Noodles and found them not as good as in the past. Also ordered 2 orders of shrimp Fresh Rolls. Not one roll had a single piece of shrimp and only cabbage. Something has changed!"}
{"text":"Really good food, I love their chicken pad thai!  Not to mention our first time there the guys that work there are very friendly and personable!  A place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this little gem when we moved to South Phoenix, and I have to say it's the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix, and nothing else is even close.  I typically get cashew chicken.  They offer 5 levels of spiciness for their dishes, and I absolutely LOVE spicy food, so I go for a 5 every time.  Let me tell you, it does not disappoint when it comes to flavor or spice.    My wife, on the other hand, typically gets royal curry chicken, with a spiciness level of 1 (she can't even handle the spice of black pepper).  The curry is wonderful by her account (she loves curry) and also by mine (I have never been fond of curry until trying Chanpen).  It's often the holes in the wall that house the greatest treasures when it comes to cuisine, and this is no exception.  If you like Thai food or even if you don't, you owe it to yourself to try Chanpen.  It's the best Phoenix has to offer."}
{"text":"Been here an hour for lunch and half the table has been served.  I finally had to go tell them that not everyone was served.   About 5 minutes later they brought everyone else's food.   Then someone at our table jokingly asked if someone was sick...explaining why they were so slow and our waitress said \" I'm sick to\"  lol. Wow, just what you want to hear from the person who just handed you your food.   Kinda torn, the food was good,  but it took an hour and a half to get out of there."}
{"text":"I had ordered the Veggie hot pot it was delicious came with broccoli, carrots, and bok choy. The service was great! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We had the seafood hot pot at #4 heat level. Pretty spicy put great flavor. Also had pad Thai and loved it. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, highly recommend this local place!  Lunch menu has a great variety."}
{"text":"Chanpen is closed. It is now a Thai BBQ place. I loved Chanpen, and the pad thai noodles at the BBQ place were not very good. I heard the chicken is great. But I had a craving for noodles."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Even though I am a diehard BBQ guy... This place will make it less difficult to stray.  Defiantly worth the trip.  Small and quant but the food makes up for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best Thai cuisine I have had in the valley.  The restaurant is nothing much to look at from the outside, the seating inside is very small too, however, the service provided and the food is more than plenty to change anyone's mind about this diamond in the rough.  Our server was very attentive and the food was delicious.  The service is great and the food is consistently good.  We have returned time after time."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had! The service is quick and friendly. Hands down favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"They missed up my order, but it was still good. I ordered the Pansang Curry and ended up with a noddle dish that had egg, and broccoli in it..."}
{"text":"I hate that this transpired because this is super close to work and the people who work there are super nice. The last time I ordered take out will be truly the last time as I found a ROACH in my curry and only after I'd eaten some. I reported it to the Health Department who never followed up with me. The gal from Chan Pen when I called to let them know what happened offered a free dish \"next time\" but didn't sound a bit surprised to hear of the issue..."}
{"text":"So good! The ultimate hole in the wall. The area is sketchy, the place looks disheveled, the restroom is unclean. BUT the food is awesome. Had the tom yum gai and drunken noodles. You can't go wrong with those two. Customer service is also excellent for an asian restaurant. I come any chance I get when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So I've seen this place last time I was in Phoenix area. It looked good and the reviews were great, so we decided to try them out on this trip. So the food was pretty good. All of it was very tasty and flavorful! It was quick service and good sizes. However, something stood out that dropped this to a 2 star. The problem is that I had ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice, which came with shrimp and chicken. However, my fried rice had no shrimp at all. I had brought it up to the waiter, who looked a bit confused that it was missing but said \"ok\" and walked away. He came back about 5-10 mins later with 2 pieces of shrimp. Look at the picture I uploaded. It looks like it was just boiled and stuck in a dish, pathetic! I paid for SHRIMP and Chicken, not a cheaper dish. Not cool at all! My future visits to the Phoenix area will not include this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I was in Thailand last year and was craving Thai food recently; this place hits the spot! The service was awesome and the atmosphere is truly fantastic. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, not authentic. I saw good review but I was disappointed when I tried this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Phoenix.  Dining room is very small and not well air conditioned, so it's geared towards take out.  Staff is fantastic.  We got a free scoop of pineapple ice cream when we finished our meal.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"As a Thai food lover I am particular about my Thai. I tend to like my food a bit on the spicy side but not sweet. This place is one of the best I've had so far. Family owned and Mom does the cooking. Can't get any better than that. Ordered a Pad Thai with shrimp and chicken  and Royal Curry (Yellow), both medium spice. Both were excellent and way above average.. Highly recommend if you love spicy Thai like I do. Service was great, very friendly and food was quick. I don't live in the area but have bookmarked this restaurant and a place to dine when I am nearby."}
{"text":"Great Thai yellow curry with Tofu!  Had it  with a level 3 spice.  One of our group had mild garlic tofu that was also delicious!  Mmmm.  Worth trying this place, for sure!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Tried a couple appetizers, chicken satay and egg rolls, but the main dishes were great! Each of the 4 of us ordered ours with the spiciness as we wanted, hot, 4 out of 5, for my wife, medium for me, very mild for my sister. After tasting my wife's spicy dish, I appreciated the complementary scoop of green tea ice cream at the end to put out the fire!  I'll definately dine at Chanpen again!"}
{"text":"Had the beef pad thai to go.  Amazing!  Can't wait to try the other dishes.  Don't be wary of the location.  The magic is in the kitchen.  For $10 bucks it was dinner for two!  Employees are super friendly and polite!  Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"We love Thai food and have eaten at every Thai restaurant in valley and this is one of the best around."}
{"text":"Second time here and it was just perfect like last time!  Last we came it was on a Sunday and today we came on a Monday and we discovered that they have a special menu , everything at $6,95! !! I took the yellow curry with chicken and none spicy. Just perfect! !! After you ate you just feel perfectly full ! We will be back again ! Hardly recommend this small business!"}
{"text":"At first I am a bit surprised by the appearance of the restaurant looking like a deserted house but once we enjoy the food oh my god nothing to say very original and tasty  I like its fried tofu seafood hotspot. Besides the price is much cheaper than other Thai restaurants I've been to and they also give free tea ice cream Hope to come back again soon"}
{"text":"Chanpen thai is the best cuisine I ever went. Great foods and service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. The place itself is pretty small and basic, nothing too fancy. Frankly the fact that a Thai restaurant exists in South Phoenix is a great treat so I was not going to be judgmental on the decor.   We ordered spring rolls and they were excellent as well as Thai iced tea (which is pretty much delicious everywhere you get it). I got the vegetarian Pad Thai and I am kind of picky about it, I don't like how a lot of restaurants prepare it but this was quite good. Especially of note was the server who asked me if it was ok to make it with eggs. I find a lot of servers don't seem to care about your dietary  needs or consider that someone might be a vegetarian or vegan...so bonus points for that. Our server was all around excellent and quite attentive (but to be fair we were dining at an odd hour and the only ones there). My friend got the drunken noodles and thoroughly enjoyed them, I had a bite it was quite good. Unfortunately I was much too full to try dessert, but I will definitely be going back.  I encourage everyone to go here and keep this place open!"}
{"text":"Yum! Best Thai food in Arizona! When we walked in I was doubtful because the place was kind of like a hole in the wall shack but the food was amazing! We ordered the Tom Kha soop which was really good plus potstickers and ginger duck. Beautiful presentation and great food. I will definetly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and don't think I would've come in otherwise because it doesn't have an inviting exterior but I'm glad I did. We ordered curry and pad see yew and it was all amazing they even brought us complimentary ice cream."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai in Phoenix! For almost 3 years I have been trying to find a half decent Thai restaurant here and all have come up short, until today. Based on previous reviews I decided to take a chance and order take out. The first positive sign was the way it was packed, each item wrapped up well and placed in a box. When I got home and tasted it, I was blown away! Green curry chicken, Sweet basil chicken and Tom Yum soup. All had great flavor, cooked and seasoned perfectly. It's a bit of a hike from me in Arcadia but well worth the drive. I'll be making this a weekly stop. Solid!"}
{"text":"Do not let the location or appearance deter you from trying this place. Yes, it might be a little outdated but the food and service is outstanding! I was visiting the area for the Super Bowl and was craving Thai food so we checked Yelp for the best reviews and this place was the lucky winner. We were the only ones in the place around 6pm on a Monday night so a relatively early dinner but by the time we left, the place was almost full and more than five people had come in to pick up their orders to go. We ordered the chicken potstickers, spicy sweet basil with chicken, and panang curry with chicken.  I like a good amount of spice so we ordered at a level 3 for both entrees and it was perfect! The servers were attentive to water refills, asking how the food was, if we needed anything else, etc. Upon receiving the check, we also received complimentary ice cream which was just as delicious as the main meal! The ONLY  thing that could make this fabulous find even better is a delivery service!"}
{"text":"WOW! what a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere  (looks like it is run by a group of college friends that decided to start a Thai restaurant).  This place is small and cramped, but all the ambience informalities are overcome by the first bite.  Everything we tried was good and authentically Thai.  The service was great, and we were offered free Coconut Pineapple ice cream after our meals, which too was delicious (even though it was free)."}
{"text":"I ordered something there for lunch, I couldn't quite make what it was.  It was too spicy!  I told the server I didn't want spicy (there were 3 choices, I asked for the mildest one) and it was strange-tasting, too.  I asked what it was several times because the information on the menu didn't make any sense but she didn't make sense either.    Anyway, it was way too hot and I like spicy foods but not this entree.  It could've been spicy to cover something bad.  I had to leave it, and I paid for it to be polite.  She asked me what's wrong with it, I told her I wasn't hungry anymore.  I have to give it a no rating because even though it was too hot, I could taste something (rats, maybe) but it was weird-tasting and gross.  I heard so many good reviews from my friends, i have to say my friends have no tastebuds.  It's a little too expensive and the portions are small.  I know better Asian restaurants in Glendale, AZ, this one NOT."}
{"text":"The Best Thai Food Ever!  Too bad I live on the East coast but I'm counting the days until I return. It's that good!"}
{"text":"This place has definite room for improvement. The floor was visibly dirty. I almost walked out based on this alone because if what they present isn't clean, how does it look where we can't see.  I gave it a shot due to the yelp reviews.  When I ordered my food they were friendly and told me they could make the food to my dietary needs (vegan) and I requested fresh tofu.  All seemed promising.  When my food came out, it had fried tofu. The server told me to try it but if I wanted it the other way they could do that too.  I didn't know what to do at this point, I ordered it as fresh because that is what I like but I didn't want to send the dish back because of it.  The food tasted okay, nothing great. A new server then came up and asked if my food was not made to order.  I told her I requested fresh tofu and she took my plate away promising it to be right.  The second plate I received tasted much better and was made correctly.  I wouldn't say it was the best Thai I have ever had, but it wasn't bad.  Ultimately, the dirty floor, some minor upkeep, and the odd service led to my rating. I feel that all of these things could be improved on."}
{"text":"Tiny spot without much polish, but the food is excellent; didn't expect it to be this good. Had the Coconut Soup, was very authentic and one of the best I've had outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! The Drunken Noodles and Red Curry we're spot on. Don't let the outside fool you"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic thai food! My wife and I both got curry and LOVED it. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the building fool you, this restaurant is legitimately good Thai food. I got the lemongrass (tom yum) soup and the red curry. The tom yum was incredible, and easily enough for 2-3 people as an appetizer. I ordered it 5/5 hot, and it was indeed 5/5 hot. The red curry was delicious, and not too thin (which I've noticed time and time again at many Thai restaurants). It is served with a generous portion of white rice which was cooked well. Last, as an added treat, free of charge, they brought out a small portion of green tea iced cream (if you haven't tried it, HIGHLY recommended). The service was fast and friendly. I'm sad I'm only in Phoenix for a day, as this would be a favorite place of mine!"}
{"text":"Really great food, friendly service. Medium spicy was hot but delicious."}
{"text":"Some of the best food.   Curry for me,   sweat an sour for the wife.   After several visits it's never disapointed us."}
{"text":"I love their food! I work at a company near by and we often place huge group orders and it is always ready on time, hot, and delicious! Now that I'm moving to a different part of town I've tried 6 other Thai restaurants and none of them can compare."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. They start you off with a large mason jar cucumber water which was refreshing. I had the fresh rolls for an app and drunken noodles with chicken and shrimp. The rolls weren't as \"fresh\" as I would have like, it appeared they may have been made the day before. The drunken noodles were great not too soggy with the right balance of meat, veggies and noodles.  I would definitely eat that again!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com love this place, addicting food and great prices.  The owners are amazing and kind people.  I either eat in with friends or take out.  You do not wait long for the food.  Oh yah FYI You may have to unbuckle your pants when leaving.  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is place is good! Food was great!! Food came out quick (because it wasn't busy) and it was of great quality!! I love Asian food and this will definitely be one of my go to in the future. I live in Arcadia and this is well worth the drive!   Awesome food!! Yummmyyyy!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I am very happy to say that our experience was very good. We walked in and were seated right away, and the food was delicious. I recommend coming here for any meals."}
{"text":"I'm still sitting in the restaurant as I write this review. The ppl are very nice, food was delicious and so was the ice cream.... Even my 8 year old said it was delicious! We will def be coming back!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We started with spring role and it was falling apart when it just got on the table. I ordered pad Thai with shrimp and chicken here but none of the protein was fresh and as a matter of fact, the shrimp was so spoiled that I could taste the ammonia built up in the texture. The chicken was not really that fresh either but oh well it was edible at least. The pad Thai could use a bit more green onion for better flavor than just smothering it with pad Thai sauce. The ice cream was nice and refreshing. The curry according to my husband was a \"meh, generic curry and nothing really that special\" kind of dish and he gave it a 3 out of 5. The service was nice and the wait was mildly longer than expected but we arrived fairly late at night so that might be why. Overall our experience was just \"so so\", it's good to have Thai restaurant for dinning variation in your local area but it's not incredibly impressive when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"On our way to the airport and found this little place.  The food was excellent.  The place is very small but we were able to get a table right away.   Get the drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Favorite Spot when I'm traveling in the Phoenix/Tempe Area. Drive slowly or you may miss this little place. Food is amazing. Green Curry is a favorite and I like that I can order choice of meats. Always piping hot and ingredients have been consistently fresh. I order a spicy level three which is hot, but not overwhelming. Restaurant is friendly and small, the staff offered soup at no charge while I waited for my take out order."}
{"text":"I thought the Pad Thai would be amazing from the reviews I read but after getting takeout and getting home to find out the sauce was not like regular pad Thai and it was a little orange and tasted off I was saddened. I have been craving Pad Thai since I got pregnant and I rarely eat out and I was excited to eat here. I don't know about the other food here, I liked the service though. I was given complimentary soup and a glass of water while I waited for my take out and everyone working was friendly. I would come back here but not for Pad Thai."}
{"text":"My husband found this place on Yelp. I didn't read anything about it, so when we got there and I saw this grungy looking place I wanted to kill him. Now, I have a severely suppressed immune system from leukemia and had a bone marrow transplant so I have to be very careful where I eat. But his friend from out of town was with us so I decided to try it.  OH.MY.GOD! The food was so good. It is the best Thai food in town. It was like eating my mom's cooking again. She started Siamese Kitchen back in the '80s and won best in Phoenix several times, so I know good Thai food. I had the garlic chicken, hubby had the chicken curry with potatoes and the friend had Pad Thai. The garlic chicken was so good I wanted to lick the plate clean. I tried some of the curry and it was really good too. The friend said the Pad Thai was some of the best he'd ever had.   It is a super long drive for me since I am way out in NW Peoria, but anytime I am near that part of town I will be going. I might have to make excuses to be in that part of town now."}
{"text":"Ok this place is in ghetto world. The place looks run down. Should I risk it? Yes I should. The reviews don't lie (just as the hips do not either). My meal came with a little bowl of soup... Sweet and spicy... Wow! As I sit on a termite eaten chair out front (since the restaurant is at full capacity - 10 or 15) with my friends I think wow these spicy noodles are great! On a later date i did take out. Everything was incredible! It had the dynamic duo: good and cheap. I hear that they opened an additional restaurant up the street. Does it have the same charm?"}
{"text":"Thoghtful staff, quick and tasty food, and complimentary ice cream. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"I tried this place purely on good yelp reviews, otherwise i would have kept driving. Green curry and eggrolls was delicious. I will definitely go back...this week :)"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Pad Thai I have ever eaten. So much flavor, not dry like other pad Thai's I have had. Small place but they certainly pack in a lot of delicious flavor.   I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great drunken noodles. Complementary delicious ice cream. Really polite and attentive staff. Ordered my noodles 3 of 5 spicy. Probably should have gone with 2. Casual nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good food. I'm not a fan of Thai but my wife loves it. We were both thrilled with what we got."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in Phoenix. At some Asian restaurants I avoid ordering meat because it isn't good quality, but I have no such worries here. All of their meat has been top notch. Their veggie dishes are great too. I don't have a favorite meal - the pad Thai is really good, but so are all the curries I've tried. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch today. Great food and service. Sweet and sour lunch combo was on point."}
{"text":"Why is it that all of the best restaurants in Phoenix are in strip malls?  After hiking south mountain, this little restaurant off baseline caught my eye so I stopped in for some soup (Tom yum/lemongrass).  Here's what impressed me:  1. Extremely flavorful broth, appropriately spicy (I ordered level 3 hot) 2. They did NOT skimp on the chicken  3. Hot pot with a live flame kept my soup hot 4. Egg rolls came out right away and were tasty too 5. Ice water came out in a jar, with slice of cucumber 6. Complimentary scoop of ice cream! 7. Good bang for your buck  Looking forward to coming back and trying some entrees."}
{"text":"Called in for a take out. Customer service was excellent!!  I was a bit skeptical when we pulled up but the food was delicious!! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food. Get there early seating is limited but you'll enjoy every bite of the flavorful scrumptious meals they prepare."}
{"text":"The Red Curry (option number 1) off of the lunch menu (with a requested spice level of 3), was amazing.  You have a choice of tofu or chicken, and I chose the chicken). The chicken was tender and lean, while the coconut milk gave the dish a hearty, rich quality.  The Thai peppers slowly but surely ratcheted up the heat to a bold but satisfying level.  This dish comes with well cooked side of steamed white rice.  The portion of rice wasn't huge, but turned out to be the perfect amount when I finished.  This dish also comes with a small bowl of the soup of the day.  The soup I had was good, but did contain some cabbage which isn't my favorite.  The broth was piping hot and flavorful, leaving the impression that it was a quality soup.  The egg roll that accompanies dish is tasty, but so small that it made me chuckle.  Lastly,  the size of this restaurant is too small.  It was completely full at 1:30 pm in the afternoon.  A table became available after 10 minutes, but groups over 4 will find they need luck on their side."}
{"text":"Excellent good and definitely a great find if you're staying at the Arizona Grand Resort. (They're near - across the street)  Definitely try the red curry and the Spicy Basil. Although if you like ground chicken for spicy basil, just make sure to ask.  Will definitely keep on coming back."}
{"text":"I must be honest; I have ate at nearly every Thai restaurant in all of Metro Phoenix. I love Thai food. I had never been to this restaurant because of the location and appearance. What a foolish mistake that was... the food is here is A+. I have always been a big fan of Yuphas in Tempe but Chanpen has finally brought competition. I am excited to have a great Thai food place close to work. The staff was very friendly and I felt right at home. I will definitely be back.  Thanks Chanpen"}
{"text":"Very yummy food. I had the Royal Curry number 4 and it was perfect. The curry was not too watery or to creamy. The chicken had flavor and does not seem boiled.(Thai short cut.) Even my picky kiddos ate all there food. The staff are friendly and the ambiance is nice. The old location has good food, but it is way too small. Just 4.5 miles from their old location.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and my family really liked the food.  We had the chicken wings, chicken green curry and beef fried rice and the yummy coconut ice cream with pineapple.  We found the employees and the owner very nice and friendly.  The service was excellent.  It isn't a fancy restaurant but it is cozy.     I would come back again if I lived in town but we live out of country.  Thanks Chanpen, we really liked the food particularly the green curry dish."}
{"text":"The epitamy of a hole-in-the-wall:  Bad neighborhood, no thrills, no ambiance.    Really nice staff, good service and GREAT food!  Well prepared, fresh, hot food that comes out pretty quickly.  Very well priced for the portions.    Do not go with more than three people in your group.  This place has five tables in it, three of which fit two people and two of which fit three people."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Quick to provide everything we needed (not an easy feat with a one and three year old dining with us). When we inquired about where we could buy some lime leaves in the area (we've been searching), our server not only showed us on his phone, but gave us a little to-go bag for our cooking at home! This plus the complementary coconut ice cream given to us at the end of the meal will leave us taking about the amazing service for sometime to come.  On to the food...delicious! We had the coconut soup with chicken (broth was so tasty--lots and lots of mushrooms), pad see ew with beef (kids loved it), and panang with pork (a bit thick, but flavors spot on). Would definitely order any of these dishes again and will definitely be back some time soon!"}
{"text":"Order the lemongrass soup! It's delicious. The building looks plain, but the service is the best I've seen. They bring out complementary bowls of soup or ice cream when dining in, and sometimes even when picking up take-out."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover!  I arrived at 11:15am and it was already packed. It may be small, but it is extremely busy.   First off, I never remember to take a picture of the food before I dig in. I had the yellow curry with chicken which was perfectly spiced. I had a great Thai food restaurant that I always went to in SC, but haven't really been successful in AZ yet.   When I get back to the area, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my second time there. First time was nice. Second time around was just short of a disaster. Things just didn't seem to line up right. Service was not only slow, apparently you have to be on their schedule, but the food order was messed up three times. I ordered the Pad Thai with no eggs and no meat with tofu with a 4 star spicy level. When it came out it had eggs. Then when it came out again, great to see no eggs, but also no tofu.  Finally the third time was the charm, or so I thought.  When it came out again, no eggs and tofu was back, but it was also not spicy at all!  I said to heck with it and just ate it. No attention to details. Trying to get water refills was lengthy and they had a table of people waiting to make an order just up and leave. As we were leaving another couple kept looking around for anyone to take their order. I'm probably not going back.  Too bad."}
{"text":"We love this place. We were all a little weary of thai food and the tiny location. We get take out a minimum of one time per week.  The crab puffs are amazing. They have actual crab chunks. We love how we can customize the amount of spice for each meal (1-5) They are always efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"This was a scary little hole in the wall I found on Yelp. C and I had just gotten off the plane from a weekend in Portland and we were both craving thai food. Not just any thai food, but down and dirty, authentic thai food somewhere that looks like you stepped into someone's million year old thai grandma's kitchen. This place took the cake!! It is off the beaten path and the neighborhood looks like you want to park near a window so you can watch your car. We pulled up to the building and it was essentially a shack, which is exactly what I wanted! We were seated straight away along with anther table or two.  Their menu was tattered and indescriptive and I got excited in only the way a tiny, dive thai restaurant can do to me. I got a red curry with tofu and veggies at 4/5 spicy. My hubby got pad thai with shrimp and chicken at 5/5 (he is brave!). We waited almost no time when our food came out. Generous portions and gorgeous presentation greeted us. C dived into his food and was astounded by the melody of flavors of a perfect pad thai. The coconutty, curried broth was delicious and the tofu and veggies swimming in it were tender and moist. We shoveled in our food and even had a bit to take home. Next time I am in the Phoenix area, I am going all the way to this place even if it is across town! Possibly the #1 thai food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Good heavens. This place is AMAZING. I cannot adequately describe the unexpectedly delicious combinations of flavors in the dishes I tried today, in their red curry and pad Thai. I'm a big fan of Thai food, but this chef really had a gift. The red curry had a stronger basil taste than I am used to, and it melded perfectly with the spiciness, nuttiness, and light sweetness and bitterness of the dish. I normally order a 4 on the spiciness scale when I get Thai food, but I had read other reviews that said this place is on the spicy side. I played it safe, and got a 3 for the red curry and a 2 for the pad Thai, and was very happy with what I got. The pad Thai is unlike other versions of the dish I have tried, in that this chef's version has more tartness, which was a very pleasant complement to the curry. And once I literally could eat no more, after being reduced to the \"just one more bite\" mentality multiple times, they brought out free, delicious, homemade ice cream. I'm going to be raving about this place for a while. If I ever visit Phoenix again, I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Found this little hole in the wall Thai place and we absolutely loved it! We just coined this restaurant \" our new Thai place\". Clean restaurant and friendly servers. Bathroom was tiny and kind of dirty, but I didn't really mind.   He ordered the beef red curry spice level 3 and I ordered chicken drunken noodles, level 3 and Thai Tea. It was all delicious, especially the curry. I would have licked the bowl if the restaurant was empty. I never had drunken noodles before but I thought it was quite tasty. The level 3 for curry was perfect but it was extremely spicy for the noodles.   Finding this Thai diamond in the rough made my day. ;)"}
{"text":"ITs no longer Chanpen. Now its Bangkok BBQ but for some reason it won't let me add it as Bangkok- Meh. That sums it up. Son ordered the yellow curry, which had previously been a big hit at Chanpen. It was only lukewarm, much thinner than Chanpen's version and had big globs of fat floating around on the top hinting at the fact that it had been sitting for a while and had lost its emulsification. I had the thai bbq chicken. Maybe it would have been better if it was even somewhat warm, let alone hot. The man had the bbq spare ribs. Again, not even warm. The eggrolls were pretty tasteless too. There are better thai places in town. Chanpen was one of them. I wouldn't waste my time here."}
{"text":"A Diamond in the Rough!   Cozy little family-owned restaurant. The location is unfortunate, but the restaurateur and her family will more than make up for it. They even deliver for lunch.   The food is excellent! My wife and I have probably tried their entire menu by now. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"YES ALL THE WAY. Great service great small hole in the wall great food. Try the coconut curry and pad see yew and sticky rice w mango to top it off (w peanuts and fudge)."}
{"text":"The service was fast,  food was really good, price is just right!  Plus they gave us complimentary ice cream which I did not expect! It is a must try!  I am from San Diego and If I were local, this would be on the top of my place to go list!"}
{"text":"In town for business and was looking for a local, family owned restaurant. My co-worker and I love Thai food, so we gave this place a shot. We were not disappointed! OMG, the food and the service were out of this world. We ordered the Panang curry and Pineapple curry. Some of the best curry we've ever had!!! The place is very small (only two booths and four tables). My only complain is their bathroom is in need of some serious remodeling (it was a bit gross). But the food was so good that I would absolutely come back when I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Thai food around this neighborhood. I'm happy to have stopped by after work. Food came out fast, service was prompt and most importantly, food tasted wonderful. Stop by if you're craving some curry or pad tai."}
{"text":"Chicken panang curry level 3 was absolutely delishish. Great portion, lots of chicken.  Chicken pad thai was a very generous portion. Loved the side garnishes. Meal was finished off with sweet coconut ice cream.    The staff was soo friendly, the food was incredibly delishish, and it was very well priced!!!  Small, intimate setting, not for large parties....but with how friendly this staff was I feel they would some how figure a way to fit you all in!!!  We have added this to our list of definite places to go!!"}
{"text":"We have a high expectation with 4+ star review. Tom yum and spicy green bean were acceptable. The basil fried rice tasted good. However the rice was mushy. The sate have no taste and were not grilled. The  Padthai was too sweet."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food at a reasonable price. Hot means HOT which is good but be careful what you ask for because you WILL get it. Having said that they are so attentive that just as I took my last bite of spicy (as requested) Pad Thai they brought me a scoop of green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Chanpen Thai is a hidden gem!  My husband and I had been wanting to try it since hearing rave reviews from fellow foodies.  We decided there was no better day than May Day and set out for our culinary adventure.  We agree with other reviewers that the neighborhood is questionable and that the restaurant is cozy, but don't let that stop you from experiencing some of the best, most affordable Thai food in the Valley!  He ordered Pad See Ew with beef, spice level two, and I had Red Curry with chicken, spice level three.  Both dishes were quickly prepared and were divine.    The service was professional, but what impressed us most was that the chef personally stepped out to check on how we enjoyed the meal.  For this, as well as for the delectable dishes, we'll definitely be back again ... and again ... and again!  Read this Phoenix New Times review if, after this and the other reviews, you are still contemplating where you'll enjoy your next Thai meal: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2013-03-07/restaurants/chanpen-is-back-in-the-usa-lucky-us/."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to give this restaurant a try and were very excited. However, we were let down. Certain dishes were excellent while others were sub par. On the other hand, the customer service was extremely disappointing. We requested to have sort of an appetizer sampler because we wanted to try several appetizers but the answer was no even though the ring up process is extremely manual... Ok fine. Then we ordered the chicken/shrimp pat Thai dish and it came with one shrimp. When I asked if that was a mistake I was told no. Then when I requested more they said there would be a charge.... $1 per shrimp! And then they told me that it costs them $20/lbs (why are you telling your customers this? Very unprofessional). If you look through the pictures on yelp that dish OBVIOUSLY comes with more shrimp. So that was misleading. The fried toast was just that... And I wasn't impressed. The crab puffs were the best part about this place, so if you must try it, then try those. Also, both of our drinks were down to ice with no offer of a refill. In fact, our server never returned to check up on us once the food was delivered. I feel this place is more concerned about the money than pleasing customers. I was looking forward to taking my husband but will not be returning."}
{"text":"What a great find! Yelp brought me here, looks like this is their second location, and their original one was so well reviewed that we had to check it out. One thing that stood out to me was that the server asked if we wanted our dishes spicy on a scale from 1-5. I chose zero, but appreciated that he asked. The pad see ew was delicious. I especially enjoyed the complimentary coconut ice cream, which added a nice touch."}
{"text":"Just visiting from out of town and looking for yummy Thai food... found it here. The food was definitely 4 stars but the service made this place a 5 star establishment. The staff was so friendly and the cooks were efficient. While we waited for our carry out order, they offered us bottled water and ice cream. When we finally dug into our food, the flavors were delicious.  We ordered the lemongrass soup, papaya salad, and house pad Thai noodles. The soup was very flavorful and one of the best I have had so far. The papaya salad was a bit bland but with some doctoring with the included chili vinegar, we ate it up... that being said, I wouldn't order it again.  The pad Thai noodles were tasty and included both chicken and shrimp... good go-to order for sure."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem! The food is amazing! Some of the best Thai food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Discovered an awesome.place for Thai food. Very small place, however the place is welcoming."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times was very under-whelmed.  At best the dishes have been very mediocre.  Nothing to go out of your way for and it's easy to find better Thai food elsewhere.  Although not in South Phoenix as I'm not aware of any other Thai restaurants in S. Phx.  There is very limited seating inside and the booths are not that comfortable as the springs/cushioning really needs to be replaced.  The service is good and the people are very nice."}
{"text":"Best Thai find in Phoenix.  Owner is delightful.  Don't let the small store front and location put you off - wonderful food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix to get pad thai from. The spice is on point and the thai tea is delicious."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix! The staff is very friendly and every time I go there they remember me, which is awesome! I love their pad thai, pad see yew and their teriyaki chicken. Also, every time I order my food for pick up they give me a bottled water! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I have eaten a spicy dish here during the summer, and even though I was sweating through my blouse, I would come back just because the food is authentically great!"}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for many years and I am always on a mission to find some good Thai food. I love spicy and what is most disappointing at most Thai restaurants in the valley is that their \"Thai hot\" always fall short.  This place is Thai good everything. It's a little hole in the wall but don't let that stop you from going in. I often come here for lunch for their curries or panage. My fiancé loved their pad Thai and pad see ew. My stomach burns so good for the next few hours after they have satisfied my Thai taste buds. It's a decent drive for me but I always make time."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall place. Found it through yelp and it did not disappoint! Fast, friendly service; the food came out with in 3-5 minutes of each other. We got thai iced tea, pad thai, red and green curry, and drunken noodles, all 5/5 on the spicy scale (you can choose your spicyness). Good flavors in everything, and it was all perfectly cooked. Worth trying if you are in the area and craving thai!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place numerous time but didn't give it a second look solely based on the structure. From the outside it looks a little questionable. But when I did a \"best of Thai food in 85040\" search on yep it come up with over 400 great reviews. I don't usually take time to write reviews, but for Chanpen Thai Cuisine I will!!!  It is a small place, don't plan on eating there if you arrive after 11:15 AM. My favorite dish is the Pad Thai. Food is always fresh and large portions. They even have creative daily specials. Staff is friendly and I have always had great service. When you order take out, they give you a bottle of ice cold water no charge. A hidden gem that you must not over look."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Basil with Chicken.  I asked for it hot, and to my surprise the spicing was perfection. Loved every bite!  I had a beer with lunch earlier today, so just had water.  Nice touch, they had a serrated slice of cucumber it a very large mason jar.    They gave me a small bowl of complimentary orange ice cream.  Quite yummy and removed the burning from the palate.   Total bill including tip was only $10.76?  Yes I tipped well. Service was great (other than they asked me about 5 times if it was too hot)."}
{"text":"First of all, I really really loved this place!! It is extremely small, with like six or seven tables, but had great service.  They were helpful and polite. First we ordered the fresh rolls as an appetizer, and it was so good!! The fresh lettuce and mint with the sweet peanut sauce was to die for.  I also ordered the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and absolutely enjoyed it. The sauce had really good flavor. I ordered it mild, and it came exactly that way. When we were finished they brought us complimentary green tea ice cream. I generally don't like the taste of green tea, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service there. We will return for sure. Their complementary ice cream are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Small building but great food! Had the pad Thai and loved it! Good price and very friendly service! Best Thai food I had so far in the valley. A must for all of us who enjoy authentic family cooking!"}
{"text":"Having grown up eating Thai food my entire life, I normally do not go to Thai restaurants. Sometimes, though, I like to go just to see how it compares to mom's cooking or because a coworker wants to go. This restaurant was excellent! I ordered chicken fried rice and the moment it arrived, it smelled like I was at a street restaurant in Thailand. The taste confirmed the authenticity of the food. The service by everyone was extremely friendly and prompt as well. I will definitely be telling all of my coworkers about this restaurant so they can visit it when they are in Phoenix. I look forward to coming back here again in the future."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! We are super glad we tried this place out- the owner, Mod, takes great care of his customers and most of the recipes are his lady's moms, straight from Thailand! Really great food, nice atmosphere and a friendly face :) we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good. The service not so much. It took 30 min to bring the food over to my table. The waitress was not nice, neither. I will give it another chance. So if you are for a quick bite(Lunch Time) it might not be a good idea."}
{"text":"I'm basically obsessed with this place.   Truly life-changing Thai food in a tiny, unassuming spot on a pretty empty street in south Phoenix.  I've tried the chicken satay (large portion and STELLAR peanut sauce), lemongrass soup (amazing with level 3 heat - just enough to warm you up but not overpower the flavors), pad Thai (ok...never been my favorite dish), and several curries (all are great!)  A handful of tables inside and minimal AC (if at all?  Lots of fans going and moderately warm but not hot to me).  Quick service from the one server/cashier.  The epitome of a great hole-in-the-wall spot!  Bonus:  Got our waitress to write me a little note in Thai to take with me on my upcoming trip to Thailand!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food ever! Don't be deceived by its look. It's a total gem. Our favorites are spring rolls, red curry, sweet sour chicken. It's our fave restaurant whenever we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fabulous Thai Food!  My hubby and I stopped at this Thai restaurant to get takeout on our way back to the airport after a wonderful week vacation in Arizona. I have to say that I am jealous that we in Cleveland don't have such a great Thai place. They would make a killer here as they apparently do in Phoenix. The restaurant is small yet easily to find on the main road of East Broadway Road. We walked into the tiny place only to be greeted with a warm and friendly service.   Based on other Yelper's reviews I new that I had to try their Drunken Noodles. My hubby got the Pad Thai. We took our meals with us and began eating them in the airport as we waited before boarding our flight. I have to say that both dishes were huge and delicious and normally I can't finish a whole meal in one sitting. However, it was different this time around. I literally could not stop eating my Drunken Noodles. Pure gluttony on my part. They were that good.   I still dream of this place and the next chance that I will be able to eat their food. Thank-You Chanpen Thai! You are that Good!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant should be called \"Da Jewell in Da Hood\" Best drunken noodles I have had anywhere; tender, just the right amount of moistness with perfectly cooked veg nestled throughout.  I chose chicken as my meat, which was  juicy breast meat.  The wonton soup is fresh tasting, with pork dumplings, chunky vegetables, and savory broth.. I will be getting that to go each time I visit, which will be often.  My friend ordered the yellow curry, which I tasted, and that was amazing!  They give you the choice of heat from 1-5, and it is consistent time after time, unlike other Thai restaurants whose heat factor varies, depending on the chef that is working that particular day.  The egg rolls are crispy and full of flavor.  Now that I have tried them, they are a must.  When we went, going only due to the Yelp reviews, we noticed there was only one car in the parking lot, joking as we walked in, that It was the cook's car.  We were wrong....it was the cooks and the owners and the server's!  This mom and daughter team do it right.  They comped us a desert...phyllo wrapped condensed milk...I know, I know sounds awful..but get ready for a party in your mouth!  You must try it!  The owners are from Thailand, which makes for authenticity, and I must say, are some of the  most gracious, appreciative business owners I have come across.  Don't let the location and modest appearance of this treasure fool you or keep you away.  Go....you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  But the thing that impressed me the most was when a homeless man came in, one of the employees went up and spoke to him for a moment, then shortly after, they sent him off with a free meal and water, no questions asked. It's great to see a small family owned restaurant take such great care of their community.   I don't live in Phoenix,  but if i did,  I'd be here all the time"}
{"text":"The food was really good as well as the friendly service !  Will be going back to try the rest of the menu for sure."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall at it's best!  Great service, delicious food, and coconut ice cream after the meal. We are the fresh spring rolls, which my wife said were the best she's had. I had the yellow curry, which in my opinion, is the best I've eaten as well."}
{"text":"I hope the food is good because the service stinks.  Walked in at 8:30 and was told, \"We close at 9:00 but we wanted to let you in.  Are you going to order to go?\" Seated myself at one table - tabletop was dirty... Moved to the next...less dirty but not clean.  Was handed a mason jar full of ice water and floating chunks of what I will optimistically assume to be tea leaves.  Staff is eating in the kitchen (visible through counter pass through) A lady with two small kids (4-5) just walked into the kitchen.  The food is nothing special; main course only no side soup or salad.  The drunken noodles are gritty.  Overall, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Just had the Penang chicken spicy as they can make it! Just brilliant - great flavor / tender chicken : tasty veggies - like I said brilliant - bru you fellas make lekker kos!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for take out and couldn't believe our luck. We are not from this area so we just took a chance. It looks sketchy on the outside but trust me, GO IN!  The service was phenomenal and the food was even better. They gave us a complimentary bowl of soup and a bottle of water while we waited. I wish I could take gallons of the soup back home with me. We ordered the masamun curry and the pad Thai. Best I've had!"}
{"text":"A lot more spacious and cleaner looking than the location on Broadway Ave, but with the same great taste. Had the royal curry no spice but with added peanuts and it was amazing. Curry was perfect, portion just right. They serve drinks in big mason jars and we got thai iced tea so it felt like two servings of thai iced tea; we couldn't even finish it! Service was outstanding and we even got complimentary green tea ice cream for dessert! Chanpen is the best thai cuisine you'll come across this side of town."}
{"text":"The best Pad Thai that I've ever tasted. Seriously. Free coconut ice cream as well! And friendly & attentive service as well! I will be back with everyone that I come into contact with!"}
{"text":"Before I write this review, a few disclaimers. I've never been to Thailand. Thai food Ive had is mainly from the Bay Area in California. And this is the only Thai place I went to in Arizona.  Without further to do....  I was very disappointed with the food. The green curry I had was very watery. We ordered 3 beef dishes and all tasted very similar, but had different vegetables that accompanied the beef. Pineapple fried rice could have used a little more flavor.   What was good:  Pad see ew was good, but nothing that stood out from other places. Tom yum soup was very flavorful and had good chunks of chicken and mushrooms. Thai ice tea was on point as well. They gave us big portions, which is always a plus.   This was a take out order so we can't comment on the service, but the people there were very nice when we checked out."}
{"text":"After trying numerous Thai restaurants since moving to Phoenix, I finally found the best spot in the valley. The food is so delicious and the service is great. It's a little out of the way but worth the drive for this Authentic meal. I recommend the coconut soup (Tom Kha), lemongrass soup (Tom Yum), Pa-Nang curry, pineapple red curry, and mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"Staff was amazingly friendly, food was on the table within minutes! Food had amazing flavors. Their soups are outstanding and of course you MUST try the Thai tea! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I drive all the way from Surprise to go here. Very flavorful fresh rolls and lemongrass soup. Tentative and happy service. They always give a complementary ice cream at the end of the meal, which is always great."}
{"text":"Stopped in and every seat was full. Waited only about 5 minutes to get a seat. Waitresses very friendly and we're VERY good at refilling drinks. Food was out quickly. We got the red curry and the chow mein style noodles. We were all extremely happy with our choices, so much that all of our plates were empty when we left. Would definitely recommend and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch. It's a hole in the wall that focuses on good food. The atmosphere is not fancy but their food makes up for it every bit. Definitely recommend. I have had better Thai in other cities, that's why I don't give it 5 stars. But over all I will be there again and again."}
{"text":"Nailed it!!! From the atmosphere to the cucumber water in a mason jar (what! In a Thai restaurant?!) the Thai iced coffee was great and served in a tall, elegant glass. The Panang curry was great (although I didn't taste any cinnamon). Pad Thai was outstanding and definitely not dry, which is way to common. Basically, it was awesome! Go there. Definitely."}
{"text":"Very good. Had the Drunken Noodles with chicken and spring rolls. Fast service hot and delicious. Nice atmosphere. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had the green and yellow curries. All the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful. They also offered 0-5 for heat. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I will echo what all the others have said.  This is great food, great value & made with love.  Had the fresh spring rolls, drunken noodles & green tea ice cream.  WOW! what a meal."}
{"text":"Listen. Don't let the outward appearance scare you. When my husband stepped out of the car, he looked at the building and said \"are you sure this is it?\" And this is a man that's eaten from some questionable places. Ha. I mean, it's a hole- I'm not sure there's another way to put it. It's also run down inside- I won't sugarcoat it. HOWEVER. The food is delicious. I have been harassing my hubby to high heavens to get Thai with me since I've never eaten it and I finally found a place with very good reviews. The waiters explained the food to me and were very pleasant and welcoming. They gave me pointers on what to order so we went with something new and something familiar.   So. We ordered Pad Thai and Sweet and Sour chicken. Pad Thai was delicious- and the lime just raised the flavors higher and seriously made my mouth hum with happiness. And I love me some peanuts in food so this was great. Sweet and sour chicken was sweet and I loved loved the cucumber and tomatoes in it- seriously awesome sauce. The food came out fresh and was flavorful and felt like I was tasting authentic flavors. To me, the worst thing you can do with food is leave it bland and there was nothing bland here. Totally will return- maybe even try their new location in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Immediately when we sat at the table we were brought giant mason jars full of cucumber infused water. The service was very quick and the pad thai was the best Ive had since leaving the east coast. We were brought complimentary ice cream for dessert. The prices are definitely very reasonable. Love this place!!! We will be back when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious Red Curry and Chow Mein. Bless me soul. The environment is intimate. Every meal cooked in the kitchen brings a new savory story to the restaurant. What this restaurant lacks in atmosphere, it makes up for in it's cuisine.  The wait staff was exceptional as well."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while conferencing and found it to be terrific! I had Rah Nah and my wife had Pad Thai. Flavorful, spicy, ample, and timely servings. Hope I can return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai in the most non-descript and possibly unsafe part of town. Worth the detour and would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"This little restaurant has amazing food. The staff is super friendly and very attentive. We usually get a soup or curry and spring rolls. The wings they make are also delicious! The only thing that bums me out is that the place looks dirty, the walls the floors the ceiling, this place needs a serious deep cleaning."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a Thai restaurant! I love me some Thai food and this place is AMAZING! it's in a weird area for a restaurant but the food was amazing. I ordered the chicken pad Thai level 4 spicy and chicken spicy fried rice level 4 spicy. Now, I like spicy and this was f-ing spicy!!!! My mouth was a little bit on fire but I didn't mind one bit. There was plenty of chicken and so much flavor in both dishes. You know how some Thai places are bland and there is hardly any meat?? Well, not this place I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy fried rice with chicken it was crazy with flavor. Haven't enjoyed a meal this much in a while. The owner said our food took a while to cook so he brought out some macha green tea ice cream to make up for it. Really beautiful atmosphere. Great date place as well."}
{"text":"They're back! This place has the best panang I've had in the valley. Do your taste buds a favor and come here."}
{"text":"This is one of those hole in the wall restaurants that is amazing, the food is so yummy. The restaurant itself is very clean & cute. The Pad Thai is my favorite along with the vegetable soup."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai I have ever had!!! Coconut soup is amazing. One order served daughter, wife, and myself with refill. Came in a flaming volcano. Came for lunch on a Saturday. They were busy. Service was great. Food came out fast. Portions were large, and very reasonable prices. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"good food !!! however very disgusting when 2 of the male employees were standing in the the middle of the restaurant making out !!!! absurd  , he very well could have had his hiv infested hands on my food !!!! wtf ,,,,, unexceptable and pure filth"}
{"text":"I haven't found my \"go to \"Thai place in Tempe yet but this one is pretty close I think.  Another visit could possibly determine that.  I stopped in last week for a quick lunch with a co-worker for my first visit.  We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was a nice lunch crowd but still plenty of seating.  Within the first maybe 2 minutes of sitting down the server came over to ask us if we were ready to order.  I could tell they were used to having regular customers because she gave us no time to look over the menu.  No big deal!  She came back a few minutes later, this time we were ready.  I ordered the Pan Thai with Chicken and Shrimp with a number 2 spice level.  She ordered a vegetarian dish (I can't remember the name). Within a few minutes our soup came out pipin' hot.  Great!  I love really hot soup!  Before we finished out sop, our entrees came out.    Immediately upon looking at my food I noticed a huge shrimp sitting directly on the top of the dish.  I thought great!  They're not cutting corners there. I quickly skimmed though my dish to locate the rest of the shrimp and chicken and was disappointed to find only ONE shrimp.  That one, huge, lonely shrimp sitting on top of my noodles - That's it!  No other shrimp anywhere.  There were about 3 pieces of finely sliced chicken, lots of fried egg and the noodles. The flavors of everything were super good.  My spice level was 2 and that was perfect. Anything higher I wouldn't be able to handle.    As mentioned, I was highly disappointed with the portion of chicken and shrimp in my lunch, however, maybe it wouldn't be the same situation if I were ordering dinner.  I do plan to try them out again soon for lunch and will update my review."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting Pad Thai in the Valley! Great staff! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food in a charming little place . If you've ever traveled iand enjoyed traveling Southeast Asia, you'll dig this place..."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai food I have ever had. I highly recommend the pot stickers as well as the pad Thai. At the end of the meal they brought me complimentary coconut ice cream! Also, they played usher the whole time I was here!!!  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting the Valley and were lucky enough to find Charpen Thai on Baseline Rd.   I had the Pineapple Green Curry with Tofu and absolutely loved it. My husband had Pineapple Fried Rice and raved that it was the best he had ever eaten.  I enjoy my food hot. However, nine times out of ten I order my food Thai Hot and get American Hot instead. At Charpen I ordered a 5 from the 1-5 scale and found it needed a bit more heat. Our server happily brought me some delicious crushed pepper paste that spiced it up nicely. He also told me I could order hotter (1-10) for next time.   The service and menu prices were a delightful surprise. We will certainly return if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the service always amazing.  Little gem that's always busy and yellow curry dish is my favorite.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and grabbed some carry out from here since it was nearby and rated well. I was NOT disappointed!!! I ordered red curry with chicken, adding broccoli and carrots, spice level 1. It was PERFECT!  Some of the best & tastiest I've had! My husband got chicken with cashew nuts, & said his was great too!  Also ordered the crispy egg rolls, which for the price (2 rolls for $2) were much larger than I was expecting - could've easily gotten by with just one order!  They were really good too.  Over all, a huge !!"}
{"text":"This place serves very good authentic Thai food. I've tried many places around the Phoenix area and this is hands down the best Thai. The location is small with only about 7 tables varying 2 tops or 4 tops but is so worth eating here even if you must wait or take it to go.  This place gets very busy around lunch times and usually maintains a near full house almost always."}
{"text":"We drove 45 minutes from North Scottsdale and it was totally worth it! The atmosphere is nothing fancy but the moment you walked in you knew right away that it would be amazing and it was.  I had the vegetarian pad thai and my husband had the curry dish. They gave us complimentary green tea ice cream. Dinner for two for $24. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai restaurant! It was a pleasant surprise to find this restaurant in the strip mall near the Fry's grocery store closest to our home. We've eaten here several times & never been disappointed. We especially like the Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp, and the complimentary ice cream they serve for dessert is an added treat. We highly recommend Chanpen Thai Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Insanely delicious! Ambiance a 2 but food a 12 so a perfect match. Worth the visit! Generous portions and kind people. Yum! Can't wait to try another dish."}
{"text":"This is a ghost update. My last visit to this location was for certain some time in April2015.  I am writing this updated review based on all of my frequent and many times dinning at Chanpen Thai Cusine. You may be asking what's prompting this sudden desire to update my review for a place that I haven't visited in over 2 years. The reason is I no longer live in Arizona. I never thought that I wouldn't find a Thai restaurant as good as Chanpen. But that is precisely what has happened. I searched and I have not encountered any Thai food as good as Chanpen.  It took me a certain period of time trying different Thai restaurants. To come to the conclusion. The best I left behind in PHx;  Was Chanpen and I have yet to find one that is as good. The reason for this is. The owner Chanpen is a Lady that cares what Go's on each plate and won't let any food leave her kitchen if it does not meet her high standards This is very evident from the fact that whenever we would eat at Chanpen she would almost always come out of the kitchen and asks us how was the food. Also we would all always asks for less salt and veggies crispy( less cooked) and every time Chanpen Thai Cusine would come thru perfectly. Vegetables were always in abundance portions were ample and the taste was delicious. One time and only one time we got our food and it was different we all noticed rite away. Frist the portion was very small and veggies were not in abundance. We asked the waiter and he told us that they had hired a new cook. We politely made a few comments about how; the food is not the same. Expressing that we were hoping that this was not how it was going to be.  Four days later we were there for dinner and, Chanpen came out of the kitchen and apologized for the the prior meal at our last visit......and she went on to explain that she had hired a cook to help her, and that the new cook was not making the food up to her standards after giving them  a week or so on the job. She ended up just doing all the cooking by her self. She said that they kept sending plates out with small portions and that she kept having to remake them or stop them before they left the kitchen. Chanpen checks every thing before it leaves her kitchen. She's not leaving it up to hired help.  Chanpen is the best.  Delicious food Ample portions And an owner that cares about her customers and wants to make them happy."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch to be delivered from here after reading the reviews. I was impressed! The egg rolls were cooked to perfection, not soggy or oily AT ALL. They cut a hole in the delivery container so the steam from the egg rolls could get out and avoid making the egg rolls soggy. I ordered the lunch portion of Pad Thai (medium/hot spice level) and it has some serious heat but not so that it's not enjoyable. The noodles are perfect, chicken is juicy and has a wonderful flavor! Delivery boy was very nice. I will be ordering from here again! :)"}
{"text":"Crazy little gem hole-in-the-wall. Excellent food and quick service. Its not spot on authentic but its good, cheap, and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how glad I am to have a Thai place in South Phoenix!  My partner  and I decided to check this place out tonight.  I had the Panang curry and he had the drunken noodles.  Both were excellent!  I always eat brown rice and I was glad that was a choice here.  I can't wait to go back and check out other items on their menu.  I would give the place 5 stars if I could order a beer...I love to drink Singha with my Thai food.  Next time I will pick some up and bring it with me."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the spicy noodles here. The potstickers were great. The curry was good but nothing to rave about. The water mason jars were sitting out when we came in which seemed a little weird to me since there was 30 cups out and maybe only 6 people total dining in at the restaurant. The cup didn't look super clean so I was hesitant on drinking out of it without a straw. This place is okay. I would definitely order for takeout next time and not sit in."}
{"text":"If you don't get anything else from this review, please get that they mean spicy when they say spicy and even a 2 out of 5 is not for the faint of heart.  My drunken noodles for lunch were a little spicier than I usually get, but really good.  My mom's pad thai was also pretty warm, and was served with lemon instead of lime.  WTF? Who does that? Are there no limes in Phoenix? I have to have a crap ton of fresh lime juice to enjoy pad thai, but my mom isn't as into it as I am.  I would have sent it back, but I didn't order it so its a moot point.  Let's just say that my husband's yellow curry that he ordered as a 4/5 was too hot for me to even try.  It was just about too hot for him to eat.  And believe me, he likes stuff hot.  He said it was just about the hottest Thai he'd ever had.  I think we'll be back, since forewarned is forearmed!  I'll be sticking with a 1 or 2, he'll probably knock his down to a 2 or 3.  Now, I wasn't a fan of the cucumber water but it was drinkable.  My food was hot enough that I would have drunk it even if it wasn't.  Service was terrible, though.  I don't feel its unreasonable to expect you to keep my glass full, or to get my husband some water without cucumber in it.  They weren't able to manage to meet my expectations on that front.  Their prices were reasonable and the value for money was all right.  So it's a mixed bag.  Try it for lunch and stick with low numbers, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for dinner, having just moved to this side of town we have been on the hunt for an authentic, dependable Thai restaurant as it is our go to choice of cuisine for date night or take out. After reading multiple rave reviews I was able to talk my wife into trying it out. We were not disappointed, what a gem of a spot! We ordered the Crab puffs, Pad Se Yew and Yellow curry with chicken which I added Pineapple to (sounds odd but it is LIFE changing), love when a restaurant has no problem adding or withholding something because it's made from scratch. Anyway...we were surprised by the size of the portions because they were HUGE and the prices were so reasonable, plus when we had eaten as much as we could possibly eat, they brought us boxes AND gave us ice cream, I mean come on!!!! Obviously I've found my happy food place.   Also just to note a few people have complained about the service, our servers were 100% on top of our needs and really nice on top of it, but one server did come off a bit short when we were not quite ready to order, but honestly I think it's a difference in culture not in service level.   We're definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Chanpen is another one that I have avoided reviewing because I am not sure exactly how to convey how awesome it is. (disclaimer: I have only been once, so there is still room for error, but it was really good that one time!)  My work-friend brought myself and a third lady from work to Chanpen. I had been looking for good thai on the west side. She said it was a hole in the wall.... she wasn't joking. But often those are the best places.  We walked in (a little early for the dinner crowd) and the employees were sprawled out across the couch, watching thai soaps. I found this to be more humorous than irritating, after all it is a family place. We ordered SO.MUCH.FOOD. I thought i was going to die of overindulgence.   Between the three of us, we had an appetizer sampler, 4 entree's, and rice. I can't remember all the entree's, but I know the pad thai was amazing. What's funny about me is that I don't like curry, I don't like coconut, and I'm not huge on peanut sauce. Well, that's like 90% of thai food. This place met and exceeded my picky-thai expectations.   Oh, and I drank an entire pot of jasmine tea to myself. Needless to say, I went home that night and cleaned my entire apartment from top to bottom. Maybe it wasnt the caffeine.... maybe it was just a high from damn good thai!"}
{"text":"SOOOO happy to have a great authentic Thai restaurant near work. I had seen Chanpen a few weeks ago while out running errands on lunch, and bookmarked it as a Must Try. Boy am I sure glad I did. It's a small hole in the wall spot, maybe seating for 30 max. The lunch specials all hover around the $6.50 range and come with this awesome soup and an egg roll (that comes with your food, so don't be sily like me and order extra egg rolls..you won't be able to finish it all haha). The soup came out first. it was a semi spicy vegetable soup with some red curry and lemongrass. Just a killer way to start my meal. I went with the Pad Thai with chicken and Shrimp. Easily some of the best pad thai I've ever had. It had a very citrus-like quality to the sauce, which I liked. i ordered mine 2 on a scale of 1-5 for spiciness. I could have handled the 3 and I don't really like super spicy food. Another diner with me ordered the spicy noodles (drunken) with chicken. This is my fave dish from Thai Hit, and the one here at Chanpen is just as good, if not better. All in all, a great meal and a killer lunch spot in the area."}
{"text":"We got the Pad Thai to go for our first time here. So yummy! It originally comes with chicken and shrimp for a good price! Especially considering all other places charge extra for shrimp.   I love mom and pop restaurants because I feel like they put in more effort into making their dishes delicious! They were also really nice and offered us complimentary water as we came in to pick up our order.   So happy we came across this place, can't wait to try more of their menu! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place after reading all the great reviews. The restaurant itself has a nice look inside but the booth was uncomfortable.  The drunken noodles were bland, chicken was poor quality. The silver noodle stir fry had a mush-like texture. Chicken wing appetizer was ok but the sauce that came with it was no good. My husband wanted a Thai tea but they were out. This was shocking as he orders this at every single Thai restaurant and we have never been told they ran out.  The staff seemed very uninterested in their customers. We had to flag another worker down for a drink as our server was MIA most of the time. Water was never refilled. Nobody asked how our food was. Took forever to get our check.  Did we come on an off night or something?!? I seriously doubt we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Expectations were high based off Internet reviews and they exceeded them!  My first time in and I was picking up a to go order and they were the epitome of quality customer service! Not even mentioning how delicious the food was.  Don't let this hole in the wall fool you.  Legit 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Thai food and started my search on Yelp.. Once again Yelpers got it right! Very small hole in the wall, but damn that food is on point. I got the yellow curry and Pad Thai full of flavor and fresh. If your in the area it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The spice levels go from 0 to 5. I like spice and ordered a 3. The dishes had a light comfortable burn that.didn't overwhelm the flavor.  I'm sure a 5 will be something to be reckoned with."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, and free coconut pineapple ice cream to finish your meal. We had the Phad Thai, fried rice and yellow curry (favorite)!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in the Valley. Don't let the humble appearance fool you!  I would recommend calling ahead and carrying out as their is only a few tables and a small parking lot. However, their food is fresh, well made and flavorful. Really impressed with the quality if the food. They also aren't afraid to make it hot. Someone in the kitchen gets Double Thai hot which I appreciate as most places hold off.  Really awesome food!"}
{"text":"VERY happy with this place.  My fiance and I consider ourselves kind of Thai food snobs.  And this is REAL AUTHENTIC Thai.  (I've been to the places that Phoenix magazine rated top Thai in Phoenix and went only to find a watered down mess).  There is a very sweet Thai woman in the back whipping up all of your food.  I didn't think we were going to find a Thai place we loved as much as Line Thai (in Sun City) when we moved to Scottsdale.  But we did!  While Line Thai is truly the number one, this comes in a VERY close second.  Everything we've had so far has been amazing.  And we go in about once a week now and order something different. Everything is fresh and steaming hot when it gets to you.  Be prepared: Now, when you say HOLE in the wall - this is it!  about 8 tables, if that, and it's no bigger than your living room.  The neighborhood is sparce, and a little less desirable, but I guess that's where you find all the good hole in the wall places!   The dining area isn't the cleanest either but that doesn't speak for the food or the kitchen.  What really won me over is a homeless man walked in from 110 degree heat, hot and confused and they gave him a bottle of cold water and some food and he left.  A true family business, willing to help."}
{"text":"I was pretty jazzed to see this place open here.  This is so close to my work, and I've been wanting to try the one on Broadway, but the look of the building and the area always just left me a bit scared.  I ordered takeout because I was very busy at work.  I ordered right at 11:00am when they open and the man who answered was very friendly.  He said 20 minutes.  Most places say 20 minutes and then when I show up in 20 minutes, I end up sitting there for another 10-15.  This place not only had it ready at 11:20, but asked me if I was picking up my order as soon as I walked in.  And, as others have stated in their reviews, they do give you bottles of water when you take out.  When I got my food back to work, I was a bit bummed.  The won ton chips and egg roll were soggy because of the condensation occurring in the rapidly cooling to go box.  I would suggest to the restaurant to put those in a separate container from the dish.  Even the disgusting Panda Express puts their rolls in a different baggie.  I got the Spicy Noodle (Drunken Noodle) with a spice level of 5.  It was just OK.  It was not really spicy, but I can handle spice pretty well, so maybe it would be hot to most.  The noodles were kind of odd, they weren't long chewy noodles, they were chunks of noodles.  I will say, the flavors were really good.  I also ordered the fish cakes, not knowing what they were.  Not a fan, maybe it's an acquired taste.  When I had time, I invited a colleague of mine to try it out and actually dine in.  I was hoping that maybe the food would be better eating there.  We couldn't go until noon, which is definitely their lunch rush time, so I can't complain about the long wait.  If you want to avoid the lunch rush, go right when they open at 11am or after 1pm.  It was packed, we got the last table.  As soon as we sat, a waitress came with a couple soups for us.  It was pretty good, a chicken broth with cabbage and some peas and carrots.  We had to wait a bit to give our orders and get our waters, but again, it was super busy.  My guess is that they come from such a small location, they're still getting used to serving so many dine in customers.  The food came and the portion was HUGE.  I ordered the Pad Thai this time.  Again, the noodles were a little lacking.  Kind of mushy.  But, the flavors were good, my colleague agreed.  I ordered 5 spice level again and it still wasn't spicy for me.  Just enough to give me a little runny nose, if that is helpful for you heat lovers out there.  All in all, this is a good restaurant.  Friendly staff, good food and good lunch special prices.  There is another place in the area that has 5 star food, but the service is VERY slow and it's a lot further away.  So, when I need a Thai fix and don't want to wait or drive too far, I'm going to this place 11am for sure.  I think when they ask for spicy level next time, I'll just say \"10\", that might do the trick."}
{"text":"My rating is actually 3.5 stars. no question food is very good and tasty. The negative relates to the hole in the wall, certain \"house\" practices and a lousy location.  Started off with fried won ton that was very good (served 12 pieces!). Then had drunken noodles with chicken that had great flavor, spice and heat but the chicken was very tough.  So what bothered me. A fried brown mysterious pellet attached to the exterior of the won ton. I am not suggesting it was a rat dropping but then again I don't know what it was and that made me uncomfortable given the rickety condition of the place. The second thing that bothered me was their cooler - that's where they kept ice to insert in our water. But I asked myself we are drinking tap water and the front of the house staff were drinking from bottled water so we're they trying to tell us something?"}
{"text":"The food is always great! The service was good. It was a little warm inside the restaurant today..."}
{"text":"Ok I usually don't do this The is really good Thai food,But the service suck , Sorry I usually visit quite often, but yesterday is my very last time going here, I went in Saturday with my daughter service was terrible, waitress never once came to check on us to see if we wanted more water or anything,   My one year grandson made a mess , But I cleaned the mess up  myself, so for myself you have to earn your tip, So when I bring my friends back yesterday, because she never eaten Thai food b4 , We walk in the waitress Tells me we can't set Down to eat we have to order our food to go, because last time I was there I didn't leave a tip, So I'm thinking it was a joke. So I sit down at the table , She never gave us a menu nor did she serve us ,So I talked to the manager, He also said we have to leave a tip rather the Service bad or Good  Not fair This is the one on 48th St."}
{"text":"First stop for food after checking into our hotel. And I got to say I was very surprised, yet extremely satisfied and pleased with my experience. The staff welcomed us when we came in and was able to accomodate us. The staff was super nice and friendly. The food was also very delicious and filling. The portions were just right especially at the price they're at. Also we were also given complimentary ice cream that we were not expecting. During our whole dining experience We constantly kept admiring the food and service. Do not underestimate this restaraunt's size and looks. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!  The coconut soup was so flavorful! Then we had the pineapple red curry and I can't even describe how good this tasted. We absolutely loved this place and will definitely be back. My husband and I both agreed it was the best Thai food we have had in the Valley in years!!!"}
{"text":"This hole in wall place near the Phoenix airport is an absolute must for connoisseur of authentic quality Thai food. I have been to many food restaurant in the country, and they have hands down one of the top 3 pad see ew I have ever had. Don't let the area or the outside of the store fool you. If you want tasty quality Thai food this is your spot. Sad that it is a far away restaurant from my home. Def my to go spot when family or friends land at the phx airport."}
{"text":"I want to give four stars to the food. Fried rice recommended. Fish tom yum soup recommended. However, I save one for their service. They are not quite patient when you order your food. They sent me the check while I was still eating. They do not pack the left food for me at all."}
{"text":"The royal curry was amazing. The Thai Tea is one of the best I've had. Small and limited seats but I like it that way."}
{"text":"One word to describe this restaurant... Delicious!! I come here pretty regularly and have tried a lot of dishes here and everything was made fresh and tasted amazing. The friendly staff and relaxing ambiance is very inviting. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for Thai. It's definitely worth every bite!"}
{"text":"Thanks again to all the yelpers for finding me another great place to dine. That said, it may not be in the best area, but I would not say it's the ghetto. It is a pink house turned into a restaurant, next to an empty lot, on the south side of Broadway rd. Yes is it by low income housing for sure; but I was half expecting to be running to the entrance from my car, from some of the descriptions.    Okay now that's out of the way,  let's talk food. My party order several things, something we like to do when trying a new place. We started with the chicken satay and fried tofu, both good just not what I expecting.  Next we got chicken Pad Thai, Pad see-yaw (totally spelled wrong) and a Pan Ang curry dish. All were tasty. My only complaint was the Pad Thai serving seemed small for dinner time. The other food servings seemed like a fair value. One person in the party got Thai iced tea, now that was yummy and super sweet. At the end, the owners brought us some free fried bananas with chocolate sauce drizzled on it,  also good. I would go back again.   On another side note,  though it was small, we went on Saturday night at 630pm and we were their only customers, so I am guessing they get busy at lunch (on the weekdays), based off most of the previous reviews saying that it is super busy.  Also, thank you to the yelper that suggested level three spicy, it was just right."}
{"text":"Flavorful authentic Thai food! Large portions, reasonable prices, very attentive staff! The green tea ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"Level 2 was spicy enough for me!  Pad Thai w/ chicken and shrimp was so yummy! Kinda sweet but felt the kick in the aftertaste   Friend ordered pineapple red curry also awesome hers was a level three and had a strong kick.  Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best and most authentic Thai food I've had in Arizona. (Tried 2 curries and pad Thai) But that's not why I gave this place 5 stars. After my girlfriend ordered her curry a little too spicy for her taste (and ate a good amount), we asked the waiter if he could lessen the spice and he left to the kitchen only to return with a brand new curry (and rice) cooked with less spice.   Oh and we got free ice cream! How cool is that!?!"}
{"text":"Okay, yea, it's a hole in the wall. Okay, yea, there's not enough seating. Finally, as you look around, you see the Asian network on TV, the sweet servers behind the front desk, and think to yourself, \"This might be some authentic Thai food?\" Well, to answer your question. You betcha bottom dolla it is!  I believe most of the local crowd has it right. They get TO GO. They order ahead, and the food is piping hot ready to take home. The servers or owners know most of the take out crew. They converse, make them feel welcomed, and deliver such delicious Thai food.  The highlight is correct. Get the Coconut Soup. It's fresh, sweet, and definitely savory. The food itself comes out straight from the pan. It is smoking hot. After some tumultuous experiences with the number of heat in Thai food. The wife and I went with only a 2. We will definitely up the ante next time. Although the flavor is amazing. This is quality food.  What a humbling experience in this hole in the wall limited seating Thai restaurant. However, welcome to Reno. The biggest little Thai Restaurant in AZ!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall place is absolutely outstanding! Great food, great service, great price! We will definitely be returning the next time we fly out of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  The food is just top notch.  The best Thai in the Valley!  When I lived in Manhattan, I trecked to Queens for good Thai.  This place is just good!  It is super tiny.  As other reviewers note, the atmosphere isn't fancy.  But come for the food!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Thai place in Phoenix!   Restaurant was really small but the wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday night. Food was descent (yes even for California standard ;) and service was pretty good. They even gave us ice cream for dessert!   Try the pad thai, pad see ew, & green curry! They give lots options on the spice level so make sure you pick wisely!"}
{"text":"Best thai in Phoenix! Hands down the absolute best spring rolls I've ever had. Sooooo flavorful and delish!! This place closes at 8, but stops taking orders at 745. No joke. But it is so worth getting there during regular hours. Nothing fancy; just a hole in the wall spot with great customer service, phenomenal flavors, great specials, and veg-friendly menu! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Glad this is so close to my work!  Delicious!  I like how they asked how spicy you want it on a scale of 1-5. I ordered a two because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food but next time I'll order a 1. The cabbage soup was tasty as was the egg roll. My entree was pad Thai which is what I always get at Thai restaurants and it was the best!  Check this place out!  Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, tasty and spicy. So please be extra careful if you are sensitive to spice levels.  You can feel the taste of ingredients in the food. The wait staff is well behaved and courteous. Although our wait time was longer as it was a full house in the restaurant, but the staff kept us well informed.  May be they can add a few service staff, considering they opened this site recently. But definitely one of the better Thai places to eat in town."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good service.  I really liked their Pad Thai dish.  Their curry was just a tad sweeter than I like but still enjoyed our lunch.  I would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"Pad See Ew and Royal Curry were both amazing! This place is like an oyster... Ugly on the outside but a pearl on the inside! DELICIOUS! We will be coming more often!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to keep this gem private. I eat here at least once a week, almost exclusively for the curries. I have been to Thailand and Thai food is right up there with Indian. I'm also vegan. The food is the some of the best I've ever had. Negatives: this is in the hood and the place is small. They have a sister location that is bigger and has a much better ambiance, but the food is not as good as the original IMHO. Also, not a big fan of their pad thai, and the tofu isn't top tier. The staff is super friendly. But stay away so I can have it all to myself!"}
{"text":"Oh man...you have to try this food!  The place is not much to look at, but we got takeout and took it back to our hotel nearby.  We thought we had died and gone to Heaven while eating the drunken noodles and Massaman curry with beef.  This food is authentic Thai, no messin' around.  Quality ingredients, perfect spice, so delicious.  And not expensive.  We might have to go back again tonight before we leave town!!"}
{"text":"Chanpen is one of a number Thai places up near Thunderbird and ASU West - but it is by far the best.  I frequent this place for lunch and it is always busy with a steady stream of locals, Glendale cops, students and professors.  Lunch specials are dirt cheap and range from $5-$7.  The service is decent, and the food - well the pad thai and chicken curry are flavorful and delicious.  Beware, the decor and booths are a bit dated, but remember you're there for the food. It's a bit of a hike for most, but definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very delicious thai food! I got the Crab fried rice. Sweet and salty and perfect to my liking!"}
{"text":"Love this place-  friendly atmosphere-   ordered lemon grass soup, spicey and terrific,  drunken noodles as suggested by owner-  fabulous and cashew chicken-  tastiest ever. The food was very frest and overall tasty and delicious with every bite. The owner sent over coconut ice cream on the house.  I would go here again and again!  Highly suggest."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations. The one on Broadway is a hole in the wall but great food! The one on Baseline has lots of tables . Same good food. My favorite is their panang curry. It's excellent!"}
{"text":"Damn you, Thai Hut. You have ruined me for all other Thai restaurants! After hitting up Thai Hut 3x during the last month, I finally gave Chanpen a go. All I could do was compare the two. I even ordered the same dish -- Pad Kee Mao (my fave!) -- to do a more accurate comparison.  It was good. Not great. But good. The portions are smaller, the flavors less developed, not as many veggies, the prices are about the same. The only advantages Chanpen have are that it is way closer to my house, and I don't fear getting mugged in the parking lot."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we fly into Phoenix. This place is 7 minutes from the airport! It looks sketchy & its tiny inside but I don't even care. I'll eat from a takeout container in the rental car!! OMG such good Thai food. They're pretty efficient for as busy as they usually are. We had our food within 10 minutes during lunch rush. I always get pad Thai and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place clean venue and it's pretty fast I always do pickup. One time I went there and found a bag full of wontons with a note your a stud"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall heaven! This is good homemade honest to goodness Thai food. Come by and try anything. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Probably best size is 4 people here.   Really great whole in the wall gem.   Loved the service and the food complimented all my expectations of Thai cravings!   Missed the lunch specials by an hour, but the fried banana that came complimentary to my meal was good enough!   Plus: chicken larb and Thai tea. Deltas: cream cheese crab wontons (not so much)"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall,   the unassuming outside looks of Chanpen Thai do not give this restaurant any justice. We and the Pad Thai and Pad See EW . Both dishes and plenty of mixed vegetable and flavorful sauces. Chicken and Tofu were go very well with either dish. A complementary dish of coconut vanilla ice cream was given after the meal wish was very nice. A great place for Thai if your in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Oh my god!! So good. Love \"mom and pop\" and this totally fits the bill and it's deliciousness."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We eat here every Friday and enjoy dining in with the friendly staff. The food is high quality and the menu selection is delicious. Thanks Mod!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was fresh and delicious. A little hidden gem of a place for delicious Thai food. Generous portions and reasonably priced. Pad Thai had shrimp and chicken both.  This is a great go to place for take out also. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is 100% awesome. Got their Pad Thai lunch special which definitely filled me up until dinner. I appreciated that their spicy is actually spicy and has flavor behind the heat. If you get the level 5 spicy, it'll really make you sweet. I love how they have their sauces in bottles on the table so you can put as much or little as you want. They had sweet and sour, soy, their spicy house sauce (so I think), pepper seeds, and maybe something else. Also appreciated their super temperature hot and ready wonton soup as you look over the menu. All their lunch specials were around $7 to $8.  Service was quick, courteous, and personal. Their English was very easy to understand if you have trouble understanding different accents.  The only reason why I knock off a star is the size of the dining space and the general appearance of the outside. It's a very small seating space with tables for 4 at the greatest. The outside looks very run down (banners faded and not quite secured, just a general old look to it). If it wasn't for Yelp reviews, I would have driven right by this place since I don't associate good food with dunky looking places. But I'm glad I came and will stop by the next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This eatery is awesome, the food & service great. The rest rooms spic & spam so clean you could eat off the floor and this is every time we come here. I love the complimentary desert you get too ;)"}
{"text":"Just landed and Phoenix and found this place.  Pumpkin curry was amazing! Our party also had spicy chicken and Tom yum soup.  Small place and very busy...worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Place was delicious and clean! I had the chicken and shrimp pad Thai and it was very flavorful! They also give you complimentary coconut ice cream which Tate's homemade! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This was an insult to Thai food around the world. My panang curry was melted peanut butter with veggies."}
{"text":"Since we've been in Arizona for a year and half we have not found a good Thai food restaurant until we came to eat here. The food was fantastic we had shrimp chow main (egg noodle), Tom Yum shrimp soup, and the garlic chicken... Everything was delicious.   Their customer service is superb and at the end they serve you with a free coconut ice cream as a dessert that is super-licious!  The place is a little hole in the wall place but don't judge a book by its cover. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand multiple times and this is the best and most authentic Thai food I have found in Phoenix. Plus the staff is super kind and accommodating. The food is consistently delicious. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"O.M.G.!!! Hands down best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand!!!  Do not let the outside appearance scare you off  - as they say, you cannot judge a book by its cover and it is so true about this restaurant!!!  I was here with 3 of my friends for lunch on a Saturday, two of them had never eaten Thai food before.  We all loved it! Unfortunately for us we live in Tucson but we have all said we will be back!  I love love love spicy food so I was happy to see at the top of their menu they had a 0-5 spice level when ordering.  I told the waitress that I wanted my food to be a 10 if possible.  :-)  She said no problem and then came back to me after bringing our order to the kitchen and asked if I wanted my food \"Thai style with Thai chilis\"  - YES PLEASE!  Wow, I was so happy when I got my food!  The drunken noodles were amazing!  I can hardly wait to go back and take my husband this time.  This is a hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"So, I decided to try this place... twice. My 1st mistake was trying this place. My second... trying it again. I work 1 mile from here and was always curious. I have never been inside, always had a co-worker go get it. Outside looks run down, not the type of Thai food restaurant you would in that part of Phoenix.  I cannot recall what I had my 1st time there, only remembering running to McDonald's  after trying it. The second time I ordered beef Pad Thai. This is your typical Thai dish, usually one of the most favored of all their dishes.  I had the misfortune of taking several bites before throwing it away. The beef was extremely dry, the noodles soaked in oil, and overcooked. My egg roll was nothing special. The Thai tea tasted like powder. I even tried a colleagues soup, which was pretty bad (I saw oil floating at the top).  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Thai places I have ever been to. The food was absolutely amazing and the service was even better. Every dish was cooked to perfection and the portions were perfect. My brother just got back from Thailand and said this was identical to the restaurants he was eating at over there. We will be coming back to try the rest of the menu soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times since I found them.  Loved all of the dishes I tried so far.  I always start my first order with Pad Thai at.  The flavor is perfect here, and the heat is on point.  (True Thai heat scale, so a 3 was pretty spicaaay!) The Red and Green curry dishes are delicious!  You can really taste the herbs and spices and not drowned out completely by the coconut milk. So happy they opened up near work!"}
{"text":"Ordered a to-go from here. While the taste was not bad at all, the rice was too sticky for my liking. More like a Chinese rice. Not how you'd expect a Thai Basil Fried Rice.  But taste was quite up to the mark, so will give it another try."}
{"text":"Server was rude! Food was awful! Place was dirty! I decided to try this place because of the excellent reviews, I really don't understand how it can have so many good reviews when the food is terrible, we love Thai food but this place was terrible in every way. If you want to eat great Thai food try Siam Thai Cuisine ."}
{"text":"It's a hole in a wall... a mum and pop joint. Nothing fancy... limited car park. Patience... definitely bring it. No whiners please.  Service is prompt and  consistent too. Food? Well... what can we say? Consistently good!!! The price is fair. They even have lunch special.  It's too far from where we live... They don't deliver. *sad pandas*  But see you next lunch hour, Chanpen. ^_^"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've found in Arizona! I love the fried tofu, drunken noodles, curries, soups, and pad Thai. They are willing to make most things Vegan for me, super yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm not even joking, this was the first time I'd had pad Thai before, and I literally went home and bought a plane ticket to Thailand. I went a couple weeks afterwards, and the food tasted identical to top notch restaurants in thailand. This place is AMAZING. I've tried lots of Thai restaurants since, and the only place in the US that has come close to comparing to Thailand is Chanpen. They even have Chang beer, which is so authentic! Also, try the mango sticky rice. Absolutely fantastic. Then again, everything on the menu is!!! Definitely go here if you're looking for motivation to travel across the world. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"We flew into Phoenix from Los Angeles and used yelp to find a Thai restaurant nearby the airport.  We followed the navigation and thought \"oh crap\" as we pulled in. It was a tiny place in the middle of nowhere and it was empty. We hesitantly decided to go in because we had no idea where else to go. We are SO GLAD we did. The food was delicious and made just how we requested. Even better than the food was the service. Family owned and run, the mother daughter team of chef and waitress went out of their way to make us feel at home. As we ate two other parties walked in. They were also made to feel at home and soon we were all talking to each other. when we left, \"mom\" even came out of the kitchen to say goodbye. We will definitely make a point of coming back here again if we are ever back in town!"}
{"text":"Place is too small. At lunch every table was taken, so I had to get it to go. It was also hard to breathe in there since they were frying peppers and the spice was in the air.  As for the food, Pad Woon Sen, yuck, they put that canned sliced bamboo in it. Bamboo is not food for humans. Only for panda bears. The rest of the dish was lacking in all flavor and, considering I got the veggies only version of the dish, there were very few veggies in it.   But on the plus side, there was a lot of noodles and the portion overall was big.  Based on the flavor profile, I would not go back here. Smile Lao Thai is much, much better for the same $10.70 noodle dish."}
{"text":"This was a good off the beaten path Thai place.  All the food had good taste. Friendly service and complimentary scoop of green tea ice cream at the end. I would go back"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!!!  Every time I'm in town I'll come here with no exception. Their food is amazing, great portions and customer service couldn't be better. I'm glad I came here.  I ordered a pineapple fried and and tom yum soup. Both came in big portions and tasted amazing, I was already super full and couldn't stop eating, that's how good the food was!!!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, and always great service. I don't have much to say about this place, it's just all around good food. I always get a curry, tofu larb, or fried tofu. All of which they are willing to make Vegan."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Asia food because every time I have it soon after I am hungry. So, since my appetite was back so soon over the years I really started to disliked Asia cuisine. Until about three months ago on our way home from school. I ask my son where he wanted to eat, and he replied Thai food. so, I was like really Asia food you know I do not like Asia food, but I said ok let's give this place a try. The first thing I recall is as soon as we walked in the door the welcoming greeting as you get into the restaurant.  I was very unsure, but my first time here was for lunch as soon as we walk in there was no waiting list they sat us right away. The overall floor plan was open the street view had open glass windows and even the booths had low backrest which I thought was awesome because you could 360 degrees and I did not feel like I was in a building. we sat at a booth all their table tops were white granite. The chairs and booth benches were covered with a soft white padded cushion and there framing was painted black. The tables tops empty there is not cluttered with salt and pepper shakers, soy bottles or did not have l the little advertisement menus. The floor had that wood looking tile which was dark brown or even a black with a light color grout.  Within five minutes you are greeted by your waitress who gives you your menu then walk off and brings you water glasses that are served in mason jars with a slice of cucumbers. Then you get a cup of soup that has peas and cabbage which sounds weird but is very testy. So, my son ordered the yellow curry with side of white streamed rice and served with two sides 1 egg roll and 2 fried wontons all of their lunch special come with the egg roll and 2 wontons with sweet and sour to eat with your egg roll. I kept it simple by ordering their sweet and sour chicken which had slice tomatoes, onion, Bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers and was topped with an amazing the sweet tangy sauce. The waitress asks how hot I wanted my sauce there are 5 levels 0-5 with 5 being the hottest. Then I added a chili level of 4. Also, with side of white steamed rice. Their meals are served white glass plates. My heart dropped skipped a beat right after my first bit it. The amount of heat for the chili flavoring I was like wow I think I am in love with Thai. The service time was quick I would say we were in and out with-in 40 minutes tops I lost track of time because it was that good.  After we were done eating we got the check and I was shocked by the price because the bill was around $17.48 for two lunch specials each meal $7.95 plus tax. I figured I was going to pay more. the sweet and sour chicken had a crunchy but soft breading hold down the chili and sweet and tangy sauce together was on point put it this way I had other Thai places in Tempe and I think their prices are equal and even up to five dollars more and the food is not as good it is ok but hands down I give this place 5 stars out of 5 stars because their food is out of this world.  If you get a chance and want to try or even had some delicious Thai food this how good this place is I have eaten there one a week for last 3 months and tried something different each time I have not find any I don't like I would really recommend dinner because they make their own ice cream and give it for dessert the one time I was their it was pineapple flavor IT IS OFF THE HOOK!!!! [683]"}
{"text":"Good food, right price and the right attitude. Hard to find a good combination like this even at upscale or chain places. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai had the right amount of sweet and spicy! I will be back. Everything was fresh. The egg rolls were crisp, and they even surprised us with desert!"}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding! I order to go often as my husband isn't a big fan of Thai. Every time I pick up my order I'm greeted with a bottle of water. The food is always excellent though I've never strayed from my favorites (pad see yew or yellow curry). Today, I arrived well before my food would be ready and they gave me a sample of their AMAZING homemade coconut iced cream! The bits of pineapple throughout are super refreshing. I love this place."}
{"text":"Stop by here for the first time and had one of their lunch special. It's my favorite Thai place in Phoenix so far. Would recommend anyone to check it out."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the first time tonight.  I had the royal (yellow) curry with chicken - 3 spicy. It was delicious. It came with chicken breast, carrots, and potato.  I like spicy food so I will get a 4 spicy next time. The staff is really nice and attentive. As soon as I sat down a cup of water with lime was brought to my table. The water was filtered, which was nice because a lot of restaurants don't bother and give you tap water. To my surprise, they brought me a cup of coconut ice cream for dessert. I haven't had coconut ice cream before, but have to say it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was in the area, in the mood for some noodles &&&& O M G! This place was delicious!!  I got the Pad Thai came with shrimp & chicken and did level 3 of spiciness   Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"3/10/17: Once again I find myself at a Thai restaurant that has good reviews and seemingly good, but find myself leaving very disappointed.  Only reason I gave this restaurant two stars is because of the restraunt itself.  It's nice and clean inside and the satff is decently friendly. That's the good, now the bad.  I stuck with my usual for a new Thai restaurant, Pad Thai and wonton soup.  I got the lunch option so had no choice in meat and it came with chicken and one lone shrimp.  The Pad Thai was super saucy though it was decently flavored. However due to the amount of sauce it was not enjoyable. And the wonton  soup was so salty I think they used sea water to cook it.  I honestly don't know why this place has as good of a rating as it does but after this experience I definitely won't give it another shot to redeem itself."}
{"text":"This place is very well done for a shop in strip mall. Very nice decor, clean and modern.   Service here is worth everything they really go all out for you, want you to have a good experience,  servers are funny and friendly.  The food here is great, but if you like spicy,  you have to go to the high end of the spicy scale. Scale is 1-5, a four is very good the right amount spice, but your eyes wont water:)  Overall. ..loved it"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly service nice find! Will be back. The pineapple coconut ice cream was great"}
{"text":"I just discovered this restaurant off of 27th Street and Broadway, half a mile from my office.  I will be a regular.  The food is VERY good.  I had the complimentary lemon grass soup, thai egg rolls, and green curry (with chicken).  All were very well prepared, great portion sizes, and spiced perfectly (I requested spice level 4 out of 5).  I also like that they offer brown rice - great for the carb conscious.  If you also work around the Broadway and 32nd Street area and have been disappointed for years by the lack of quality restaurants in the area do yourself a favor and try Chanpen Thai.  The dining area is a bit small/limited in seating, so if going with a larger party for lunch try to get there early.  They also deliver."}
{"text":"Very good. Not had a ton of great experiences elsewhere with Tai food, but this place is great. My wife had the Pad Tai noodles with chicken and shrimp and I had the chow main style noodles with chicken.  You can customize your level of spicy between 0-5 and we both had level 3 and that was perfect if not a little too hot so level 5 must be banana sandwich. Do not judge this place by the outside as it is small but there were a few people who stopped in while we were here. While we were here we got complimentary coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"So the 2 female waitresses were very friendly, the cashier was not so friendly. He tried giving me the wrong order and never even said hi or how are you, heck, I don't think we ever made eye contact. Now on to the food, the chicken and shrimp pad thai and egg rolls were pretty good. The pineapple fried rice was the worst fried rice I've ever had. It smells like they put a ramen noodle seasoning pack in it but it had NO flavor, it was very mushy, like the texture of thick oatmeal. Seriously do not get the fried rice."}
{"text":"OMG!!! We stopped there at 9:00 pm and a girl (waitress?) walked up and told me they were only taking to go orders because they closed in half an hour. After 60 years of eating out this is a first for me at any restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great. The customer service was good as well. I will deft eat here again!"}
{"text":"Get their coconut soup without mushrooms and the number 42! This is a great place, they remember you if you stop by a few times."}
{"text":"Ordered their Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp and their Wontons for take out.  The pad Thai was ok, no flavor at all on the chickens and shrimps.  The Wontons were a RIP OFF!!! they have little to no meat inside at all!!! Don't waste your money on that! You would be more satisfied with a bag of Doritos chips than their so called Wontons. Seriously!! So not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small and was very packed. The lunch specials are priced great. The parking is a bit of a hassle but the food is worth it. I normally don't love green curry and that's what my husband always gets but this place made it very tasty where I was eating off of his plate. I had the pad Thai and that was very good too. It can get hectic in there but you can tell it's a lunch favorite in the area."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! Food was delectable, staff was very friendly and even let me try a sample of their iced coffee which also is delicious. I had the sweet, spicy basil with beef. My tongue jumped out of my mouth and smacked my brain! I couldn't believe how great this was. To top it all off they gave us free green tea ice cream after our meal! Great job guys keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Chose this place due to Yelp reviews, ordered takeout.  This place is filthy.  I thought about walking back out, it was that dirty.  Took food anyway and had a few bites., could not eat rest thinking about dirt."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is always great, the people friendly, and they continue to be the best Thai food I have found in the Valley. It is true Thai spice, so it's better to get a level of heat let than you think you can handle. Or just enjoy a Thai tea to combat the heat. :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places ever. Their layout is super nice. The customer service was constant and superb. Their spicy level is super accurate, 4 is pretty spicy so beware. The lunch menu had a large variety and came with fried wontons and an egg roll. Plus the last touch of a piece of candy was pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Chanpen would probably be a four-star place in LA or SF, but we're in the desert and it's easily the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix. It's a very small place and you shouldn't expect anything fancy. The family that runs the place is very friendly. I tried the chicken larb, pad thai, and panang curry. The meat in larb was a bit dry but the flavors of all the dishes were on point and done very well. They will authentically spice it up for you if that's what you want so be careful with the heat scale. Complimentary dessert (we got green tea ice cream) is always appreciated. Check Chanpen out if you haven't for Thai. I think the difference between their food and other popular spots in town is quite noticeable."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!! We were hoping for a solid Thai meal but got one of the most delicious green curries I've ever had! Also the soup was super fun (just order it you'll see). We also got a complimentary green tea ice cream which was also fantastic. If you're in the area, go! Amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the drunken noodles with shrimp at a 5 for spice level. I love hot and spicy food so next time I will most likely try a spice level of 6 or 7. It was very good especially for the lunch portion. The service was pretty fast and the employees were very nice and attentive. It is a small family owned place so I suggest ordering take out since there aren't many places to sit. Very good Thai food and I will be back again. The spice level is pretty on point compared to other Thai places I have tried. The shrimp we big a plump, not jenky like some other places might be and you also get plenty of noodles. Yelp was down when I went so my check in didn't go through."}
{"text":"Yummy tofu curry & Mod (owner) made an amazing first impression which is why we keep coming back! (And of course, great food quality!)"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this restaurant with my coworkers and I have to say that the food here is probably one the best Thai food I've ate so far. We started out with some pot stickers and cream cheese puffs. They were very good. Pot stickers was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just perfect. The cream cheese puffs had the right amount of cream cheese. We also order their coconut chicken with rice and I never thought, coconut curry is so good! We also order their coconut soup and I fell in love with it! The coconut with the mixture of tom yum flavor made the soup so savory! We also order rice with stir fry ground pork and the seasoning is just perfect! However, pad thai was not my favorite as it is on the sweeter side and very saucy.   Anyways! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Sat. Afternoon. Only 1 other table in the restaurant.  I ordered the shrimp and chicken pad Thai, the flavor was good but only had 2 shrimp in it and the chicken was very dry. My husband ordered the pork and snow pea stir fry. The pork was not stir fried and absolutely no stir fry sauce,  totally dry. Thai Basil is by far a better choice!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time. I love hole in the wall places that are out of this world good. This is definitely one of them. I am not an Arizona native I just moved here 2 week ago. The side of town it's on seem a little run down and a bunch of buildings. I passed this place at first when I was looking for it. Thank god for Arizona's Grid system streets! But, I was given a water and ice cream to eat while I waited for my takeout food. THe employees were on top of it and incredibly kind. I got my food pretty speedy too. And oh my god, it was so good!! I just got pad see ew because that's my go to Thai dish but I will definitely be back to try more of the menu! The customer service and the food were top knotch!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Tempe. Friendly service and always fast! They even give you a complementary water bottle when you order to go! Be careful with the spiciness level, as their mild can be hot!"}
{"text":"Small hole-in-the-Wall restaurant but great food and service. Had drunken noodle, pa-nang curry, and sweet spicy basil. All delicious. We also got complimentary coconut ice cream at the end!   Would def recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here from a recommendation by my brother and it's a great place. The interior is fitting and the service is amazing! I ordered the pad see ew with beef and the portions were big. I was very pleased, not only that, the flavor of it was perfect, I know there are two types, one is with a thick beef gravy over the noodles, and a more \"dry\" with less sauce. This version is less sauce and it's perfectly seasoned. Some pas see views I had in the past were either too salty, or the meat was scarce. Probably the best I've had. They also had some banger korean ballads playing that remind me of my ex but luckily the food was there to comfort me from sadness. 10/10 would go again  #CERTIFIEDBANGER"}
{"text":"Yay, I found a great Thai Restaurant near Phoenix!!  I've been trying...  Not only is this place very clean, nice and cool, with great food and friendly service, the food came out VERY quickly, yet was very fresh!  I hadn't even been able to finish the bowl of soup they brought me as a greeting : )  High recommendation!  Once inside, forgot I was at a strip mall altogether."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. The first time we walked into this place, I got to admit the building is kind of sketchy looking. The old saying stays true, NEVER judge a book by its cover, this is the most authentic Thai food I have ever eaten, And when you order it Hot, They actually make it hot!, Seriously I had to go outside to cool down (it was 110 out that day). The staff is some of the nicest people I have ever met, and consider them friends now. This place truly is a diamond in the rough and is one of my top restaurants in AZ"}
{"text":"Ordered some pad Thai to go and it was delicious! The service was great too, I didn't sit down obviously but they were very sweet over the phone and when paying."}
{"text":"Great service and authentic quality Perfect Thai experience and good quantity on serving, but I always like me some leftovers"}
{"text":"Loved loved LOVED this restaurant - doesn't look like it should be good, but it's AWESOME! Good and staff are both top notch."}
{"text":"Oh dearrrr!!  This place is amazing. From the food to the service!   We had coconut soup as an appetizer. It fed 3 starved persons. We then had green duck curry and yellow duck curry. The whole meal was delicious. Everything was tasty. We were surprise when we received the bill because we expected it to be way higher.  It turned out to be 45$ for 3 persons.   The waiters were adorable. We will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Really yummy crab puffs and egg rolls. Shrimp fried rice needs a few more shrimp. But yummy overall."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Thai food in the Phoenix metro area, bar none, and maybe the best in Arizona. I've been coming to Chanpen since it opened back up several years ago and just realized (while writing a negative review of a different Thai place) that I'd never gotten around to reviewing it. I have brought, over the years, 20 or more people here, and each one of them has loved the food. Several of my New York friends said it was the best Thai food they've ever had (and they have access to a ton of excellent Thai restaurants). I almost always start off with a bowl of coconut soup to share with the table -- I highly recommend it! The curries are always on point, as are their noodle dishes. If you're not sold on pad thai, try it here -- it's flavorful and vibrant like so many other pad thais aren't. The specials they post are always delicious -- I've yet to order a bad dish from this place. Friends have gotten various salads, seafood dishes, soups, and dumplings, and always loved them.  Also, here, Thai spicy means Thai spicy. If you order a 5 on the spice scale, be prepared to sweat. The spiciness still leaves plenty of room to taste and savor the coconut flavor that makes Thai food so rewarding and decadent, and if spices are not your thing, the food still tastes good if ordered at a 0 or 1.  The service here is excellent. The waitstaff is super polite, and will give you bottled water if you're waiting for takeout, or complimentary green tea ice cream if you choose to dine in. They're great at answering questions, refilling water glasses, and splitting checks, and they never leave you feeling ignored. I also love that, despite the small number of tables inside the restaurant, they never make people dining in feel rushed. In fact, they've waited around well past closing time on several occasions so that my friends and I could enjoy our meals. Even knowing we were finishing up at 8:30 or so, they still brought us the complimentary ice cream, still helped us scoop leftovers into to-go boxes, and still gave us extra rice to take with us.  So, now let's address the elephant in the room -- location and atmosphere. This restaurant is not in a great part of town. In fact, it's one of the few things in an otherwise pretty barren part of Phoenix that tends to house towing lots and the like. You will easily drive past it if you're not looking carefully, and when you pull in (especially if it's at night), you'll go \"are you sure this is the place?\" You may even feel unsafe because of the poor lighting and somewhat dingy appearance. I urge you to put those feelings aside and venture in, because the food and service are easily worth it. Or order takeout."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Thai restaurant for years.  We found it in its original location and were so happy they opened a second one too!!  I can't say enough about how friendly the owners are and how delicious the food is.  Our favorite is the green curry chicken and the basil beef.    Plus, one day I ordered food to go for lunch and when I got home (before I had even opened my food) I got a call from the restaurant letting me know they had left out a portion of my order. When I told them I was no longer in the area they apologized and then offered to bring the food to me.  I said they didn't need to but they insisted.  Minutes later they arrived at my door with the rest of my order and refused any kind of tip.  They could have easily let it slide and I probably wouldn't have even bothered to call them or return for the missing food but they went out of their way to make sure everything was made right.  I am definitely a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Oh wow best Thai food I've ever had I can't wait till the next time I go to phx if it wasn't for yelp I would of never knew about this place"}
{"text":"I found this to be the best Thai place since I've moved back here from Bay Area.  We orderedCrab puffs , The fresh rolls ,House fried rice, Red curry  and Sticky mango rice. Every single thing was delicious and now will be a regular since we found a great Thai spot in PHX."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite since I left the Bay Area. I've been to both locations I prefer the Tempe  location.  We ordered crab puffs which were good, house fried rice again good, fresh spring rolls were excellent, Basil Chicken which I enjoyed and sticky rice with mango which I also enjoyed.  Went to another very popular  place closer to my house last week in Scottsdale -and it was half as good and $20 more!  Needless to say we will drive an extra 15 min for great Thai and a good price."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have been introduced to this little gem. I've been here twice, had the best shrimp fried rice I've ever had, amazing pad Thai and the chew Mein is good too. The potstickers were crunchy and served with a tangy sauce. This place will be a regular for me and my husband."}
{"text":"Great place to order take out and have hubby pick up on his way home!  He gets either sweet & sour or a rice dish, but I've tried several dishes, curries, seafood, wontons, and everything we've ordered has been fresh, hot and flavorful!"}
{"text":"This is a true diamond in the rough. Don't let the rundown facade throw you off - all their energy is poured into making excellent Thai food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Favorite/only Thai place in South Phoenix. Husband insists leftover drunken noodles are the best part of doing takeout there."}
{"text":"I have to admit I don't get it. All the yelp reviews saying this is the best Thai food ever. I've eaten a lot of Thai food and this was not only not stellar, I also could not get over how filthy the restaurant was. My Panang Curry was runny, the vegetables were nearly nonexistent. There were only two carrots that were obviously from a bag of frozen food and a few soggy pieces of broccoli."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good. Service is solid, lunch specials are priced well, and the food was spot on. I will definitely be back. Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me was that the Thai iced tea was way more ice than tea...which is a little lame considering what they charge for those."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for thanksgiving and with the overload of sweet flavors through the season. I was craving some spice in my life. I raced to this location at around 7:15 to make it before the closing time at 8pm. They quickly got our orders and brought it. It had a ton of flavor and everyone in the kitchen spoke Thai. The international vibe in this hole in the wall is definitely what drew my attention. I wanted mango sticky rice but the girl who took the order told us she only had sour mangos and she wouldn't offer us that because it would be rude. And I was very happy to hear her honesty and thanked her for that. Mangoes need to perfectly ripe and I am glad I didn't get screwed over. She did give us complimentary coconut icecream  with pineapple chunks and it was the icing on top!   I loved the spicy basil chicken and drunken noodles. Great flavors and great vibes.   Yelp definitely directs you correctly into the best places in town and it's always great to confirm their reviews by experiencing them firsthand."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai. Had the pad Thai. So fresh and hit. The chicken was not sry at all.  The silver noodles with beef was delicious. Glad that the server suggested that beef would be the meat of choice. Followed by complimentary green tea ice cream. This was made on the premises and was sweet , but not  in a sickeningly sweet manner.  The coconut ice cream was so light and a delight to eat.   The service was excellent  and the staff so pleasant"}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 4 times. Every time I come I wonder if the food was really as good as I remember it to be, or was I just really hungry, was it a fluke, etc... As I sit here making my way through the plate of pad Thai I'm confident in saying it's the best Thai food I've ever had. Service is food, food is amazing, and the green tea ice cream at the end of dinner is the perfect way to end a magnificent experience. It really doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"Food is so delicious, tastes just like it did in Thailand!  I would give five stars but ambiance a one, so I'm settling at four stars. This is a better place to get takeout from rather than eat in.  I ordered he yellow curry, which was delicious - I loved the flavor and heat.    Also, the restaurant is not well marked and is a little challenging to see, because it is set back a little from the road and there is not a big bright sign."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is delish and the green tea ice cream is amazing. Staff are so friendly.  Repeat customer"}
{"text":"Pretty good hole in the wall place. The soup was good, the wontons perfectly crisp and the spice just right!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! You can tell they really care and are very friendly. I'm from Denver, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"There are two locations, best is Broadway for food, go to Baseline for ambiance.  Food with quality taste and good price. Good customer service. They always offer something to enjoy while your meal comes at Broadway."}
{"text":"This is a place run very profitably by its attentive owners.  Excellent service and the food is ok."}
{"text":"I finally noticed the Chinese Restaurant has been replaced with a new Thai food place at the corner of 48th and Baseline. So, I decided to check it out. Service was friendly and prompt. We tried the drunken noodles with chicken, Penang curry with chicken (curry is more like a gravy - extra star for not being cheap about the curry. Curry should be thick!) and we got 2 Thai Teas. $26.92. Prices are about normal for Thai food. And their lunch specials seem to average $8. I give them an extra star for friendly service since the owner recognized me from his girlfriends mom's restaurant on Broadway in South Phoenix (same name). I don't visit too often, thus to remember me means the staff really does care about their customers. It's nice to be remembered :) and they serve coconut ice cream with pineapple chunks after the meal. Who doesn't love coconut ice cream?!  Stop and enjoy the food and appreciate a Thai Place who knows Curry is suppose to be like a gravy and not soup."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Thai menu. My friend got the drunken noodles and I got the yellow curry, which was great! Five stars for excellent Customer Service. Looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix. The Pad Thai is incredible. Red curry chicken is my favorite. The green tea ice cream is home made and my favorite desert. We are addicted to this place. Lunch is around $6.50 for soup and entree. Doesn't look like much for the outside but the food is spectacular."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food I have had. You have to order the chicken pad thai inch special--gives you a ton of food for just $7. Highly recommend this place but get there early because it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"I use Yelp exclusively for my dining options, out of hundreds of restaurants, this was the first to disappoint.  First I'll say service was great, fast and friendly.  Ordered the Pad see ew which came within minutes.  The flavor was just off the mark.  Not sure if they forgot a few ingredients is the sauce, or didn't let the sauce caramelize properly.  That didn't bother me until I started to look into the kitchen.  The ceiling around the vent had grease-cicles hanging from it and the rest of the ceiling looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years.  So I started to watch the staff in the kitchen, definitely some serious basic food handing training was need for all.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"So that's what all the fuss was about.  Admittedly I'm not a huge Thai food fan, but I know a good operation when I see (and taste) it.  Chanpen's rave Yelp reviews got me in the door, the service kept me from leaving on a busy day, and the food will keep me coming back for more.  Call this another one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" tales.  Today's tale goes a little something like this.  I decided to give Chanpen a try on a Friday at lunch.  Through Yelp I'd seen that they have some decent daily lunch specials.  Fair enough.  I had hopes of dining in, but when I saw the parking lot was full, I knew I'd missed my window for that type of lunch.  I grabbed parking spot next door right up against what I believe is an old church building.  The line of people went out the door about 10 deep with a mix of people ordering take out and waiting for a seat.  The restaurant seats maybe 18 people inside (and I think I'm being optimistic) so I knew right away the takeout route was my only option if I wanted to get fed relatively quickly.  After about 5 minutes in line the woman at the register kindly greeted me and took my order.  I decided to go for the Pad Thai lunch special, level 2 spice (I know, I'm a wimp).  The specs:  stir fried noodles, chicken, shrimp, egg, onion, bean sprouts and ground peanuts.  Also came with an egg roll and fried wontons.  Total cost?  $7.  The woman said it would be about ten minutes and gave me a free bottled water while I waited.  Nice gesture.  I waited outside alongside about a half dozen other folks since the inside was packed.  Ten minutes later, sure enough the food was brought out to me and I was ready to go.  When I got home to sample the goods, I was first and foremost very impressed that the food came in a partitioned take out box.  In one part of the container was the Pad Thai and the other was the egg roll and wontons.  Great move as I was worried the egg roll and wontons would be soggy had they been commingled in the take out box.  The taste?  Phenomenal.  In theory Pad Thai is pretty hard to screw up (though I've been to Thai joints that have), but this was spot on.  The noodles were super tender and moist, there was lots of chicken and shrimp and was surprisingly hearty for a lunch portion.  The wonton and egg rolls were also perfectly cooked and rounded out the meal perfectly.  Tremendous value for the price you pay.  I will say that if you're coming here to dine in, it would seem like lunch is their busiest.  Not sure about dinnertime, but maybe that's a better bet if you're looking to get seated quickly.  Even though I went the takeout route, I was very impressed with the service I received and the timeliness of my order.  But even if every trip going forward here turns out to be a takeout trip for me, today's delicious experience tells me it'll still be worth it."}
{"text":"Hole in a wall with good authentic Thai food.  Service was right on spot.  price is great.  will come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and finally a good dine in option in this area. Nice service and some of the best Thai j have had in a long time. The satay was good. The drunken noodles was fantastic"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! This is now my go-to Thai place in town. They are always fast, friendly, and incredibly delicious. They also usually give us complementary water bottles if we order to-go. The soup that comes with lunch is AMAZING, my husband is addicted to their Pad Thai, and I like to switch it up and try something new every time and have yet to be disappointed with anything. Also, their thai tea is the best I've had in town. Seriously amazing!! Oh, and their coconut ice cream is the most refreshing after-meal bite I have ever put in my mouth. So great."}
{"text":"Awesome as always. We have been gone for 2 months. Today we were in the area, so decided to check in again. It is just as great as we remembered. Sorry no pics this time.  I was hungry."}
{"text":"We've been dying to try out this \"hole in the wall\" for sometime now, especially being we still hadn't found our go to place for take out Thai since relocating here. Well, well I know we found out go to spot for our Thai fix. We drove 30 minutes to get here so right there tells you that these foodies were on a definite mission, lol! Okay so as we walk into this TINY restaurant which has 2 booths that seat four & 4 tables we are immediately greeted by the wonderful smells of herbs & spices & everthing else that goes with the fresh cooking of Thai food in a tiny place!! Yes it was that good, now as far as the customer service which you could tell this was strictly family owned & run was beyond top notch, gosh I love hidden gems like this!! We placed our order of chicken satay, crispy crab wontons, fried pot stickers, chicken teriyaki & shrimp pad-see yew, I know we went a tad overboard but we chose all our faves!! As we were waiting they gave us a complimentary bottled water & some homemade coconut icecream for the three of us. As soon as we tasted the icecream we knew we were definitely in for a treat & we found our spot, thankfully!! As for the food which my hubby was literally being torchered by the 1/2 hour drive, smelling the food & unable to sample but when we got home & finally dug in OMG, OMG is all that can be said!! The chicken satay which is my hubby's choice always was so moist & perfectly cooked & he was in love with the sauce! The pot stickers which is also all hubby took him to heaven & back, those were completely inhaled by him!! The chicken teriyaki was perfectly cooked, not too sweet & not too salty & served with plenty of sauce unlike a lot of places. Now my crab wontons were some of the best I've had, you could tell that the wonton was freshly made because they were thin & crispy with just the right amount of sweetness!! The pad-see yew was beyond amazing, I had them make it on a level 3 & it was perfect with a nice kick of spice. It was made perfectly with just the right amount of egg, bean sprouts & brocoli & served with 6 large shrimp!! We will definitely without a doubt be back & hopefully sooner than later, maybe even this weekend, lol!!"}
{"text":"I been here many times and the food is always good the prices are reasonable   The staff is friendly and the place is always busy  I recommend this place to anyone if you are in the area  I ordered the drunken noodles with beef"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food!  Short and to the point.    If you're looking for great thai, stop here!"}
{"text":"Wooooow!! The red curry chicken is having a party in my mouth!! (hot:4). I walked in and was promptly and politely greeted; ordered my food to go and the young man apologized that it would be a few minutes and handed me a water.  Great food, great service... Glad I stopped in!!"}
{"text":"Just really, really great Thai food-- great flavors, perfect spice. Stop looking for a Thai place and just go here. You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the coconut soup,  and the green curry! Also Thai tea! It was all so delicious,  and I couldn't finish it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food! Wonderful service with friendly staff. Don't judge a book by its cover!! It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Moved here from the DC area and thought we would never find a good Thai place in Phoenix. Definitely try this place out...delicious food.  If I could make one suggestion, please take some time to clean the dining area, floors and walls. My tastebuds were alive and happy while my visual experience was less than pleasing."}
{"text":"First time coming here and this establishment immediately surpassed my expectations! Trust me and don't believe those 1/2 star reviews complaining about their service! The service here is amazing!!!   The host/waiter greeted my buddy and I right away. Seated us at a nice area and proceeded to have nice small talk to make us feel very welcomed! He took the time to assist us with the menu and was very patient answering all our questions. We told him this was our first time here and he jumped at the opportunity to recommend the popular items. Our beverages was always filled and food came out timely. At one point our waiter came by and told us our interior car light was on. He was concerned that it would drain our battery. Wow! That's the first time I ever had a host pay attention in detail and care enough to let us know.   The restaurant had a nice welcoming atmosphere and awesome decorations.  The food was amazingly delicious! It's was seasoned perfectly and spiced the right way. We had our dishes at the medium spice level and that was perfect for us. It gave me enough spice to make me sweat a little but nothing close to being to hot to be unable to eat my dish. My buddy and I ordered the Panang with Beef and the Spicy Eggplant with Roast Duck. The Panang had a great texture with the right about of coconut taste. Beef was thinly sliced and just melted in my mouth. The spicy eggplant was orgasmic! I recommend it with the Roast Duck because the juices from the Duck gave it a special taste. This dish is easily my favorite. We didn't leave a single piece of food on our plates! Demolished!  The service and food was so amazing we tipped 100%! They deserved it!  I will definitely be back here if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing Thai food ! Super duper delicious food. Curry is amazing! I'm sure other items are amazing too. Once you start eating you can't stop and you want more and more."}
{"text":"Chanpen Thai serves up a decent meal in this part of Tempe and has enough vegetarian options to keep things interesting for more than one meal.   The carrots were crinkle cut, but the broccoli tasted like it was never frozen. The tofu was gently fried before going into any dish, which was a nice touch. Chanpen added chili oil when I asked for a dish to be spicier - there wasn't a thai chili pepper taste. They didn't ask how hot I wanted my dishes to be, an oddity for a Thai restaurant, but something I'm encountering more frequently. The Thai hot here was probably a medium hot elsewhere. The curry and noodle dishes were a bit too sweet.   Do you ever wonder what the history of baby corn is, and how it made its way into your stir-fried noodles and my drunken noodles? Which consumer segment continues to demand baby corn such that it commands a huge per pound premium over full grown corn? I really don't like the taste, so I'm a bit puzzled. This is something worth digging up on NPR or Wikipedia, but I feel a twinge of laziness coming on.   It was never quite clear if lunch was counter service or sit down. The food came out quickly here though. Chanpen was never busy either - I went for lunch and dinner, sometimes alone and with colleagues, and never ran into a wait or crowded restaurant.   If you don't feel like driving further into Tempe or Phoenix, this is probably the only Thai restaurant in a decent radius. Thai Elephant Bistro is nearby, but isn't necessarily a step change above Chanpen."}
{"text":"Best thai food hands down in Arizona. I always get the yellow curry extra spicy and it's the best curry that I've tasted! Excellent customer service. This is a hole in the wall restarunt!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I honestly cannot eat enough of Chanpen's Coconut Soup. It is extremely flavorful and addictive compared to any other I've had before. I've had the Pad Thai and it was good too. The building itself is very cute and tiny inside so it's not meant to seat large groups, but to order out or take a small group is highly recommended. The service is super friendly and, again, the coconut soup is great!"}
{"text":"I think this might be the best Thai food in Phoenix!! This little place is always packed with people."}
{"text":"Great tasting and fresh food with fast lunch service. Very affordable lunch menu for the price conscious."}
{"text":"a thai restaurant with an authentic setting and delicious food made with a good amount of heart.  went to lunch here today...first time..lunch special is all i've had..and this is what it gets so far.  I'd say this place gets 3 1/2 stars for its taste (which is a tad poised towards an americanized palette, but nonetheless tasty)   it gets its other 1/2star for its cheap and unbeatable price in comparison to the average thai restaurant. 6 dollar lunch special, you can't ask for anything better for quality food.  yellow curry is rich (not TOO rich) and is on the definitively more delicious side of the spectrum compared to the other yellow thai curries i've had in the past.  a very good choice.  pad thai is...pad thai.  not exactly the best out there but surely not disappointing.    i will for sure come here again in my future visits to arizona."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years and given it's location, I wouldn't even consider stopping. Then somebody mentioned it and I checked out the reviews, so I gave it a shot. It's a tiny place inside, literally six tables. You may have to wait a couple minutes to be seated, but it's worth it. Why? Read on...  Atmosphere: tiny and not the cleanest, a true \"hole in the wall\", the kind of place for me. Why? The food:  it's excellent, high-quality, fresh, clearly made with care and from what seems like \"old world\" recipes. Spices are well-balanced and the tastes are clean. Prices are outstanding, well under $10 for a full lunch and you will get plenty of food. The service is always friendly, courteous and with a smile.  It's really hard to beat this little \"joint\". They seem to have the right combination. It's certainly not a Flemings or Nortons type of atmosphere. But, if you appreciate good food with excellent quality, good portions, great service and a genuine \"non-chain\", privately owned, local restaurant, don't miss this one."}
{"text":"OMG this place! Great food, friendly service, was a perfect stop on my way to the Grand Canyon.   I ordered the Chicken Curry plate with the peanut sauce. It was delicious. The restaurant was busy, yet service was quick and efficient. I got my bill and was very reasonable. A great stop if you enjoy small and intimate eateries."}
{"text":"I have never had Thai Cuisine before but my boss recommended it for lunch we ordered over the phone went picked the food up and got back to the office pretty quickly as our food was ready when we arrived and everything was perfect. A little spicy but that was more my fault as I thought I could handle more spice than I could"}
{"text":"I had the #5 Lunch Special Pad Thai spicy level 3 (hot enough to burn my tongue but not to hot that I couldn't enjoy it). So delicious! I also had an Iced Thai Coffee that was good. Great prices & service."}
{"text":"It's consistently fantastic. I've had a lot of Thai food and this is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food.  Rice was perfect.  Got one of the tofu currys level 5.0.  Best curry ever, best Thai in the valley.  Very friendly staff.  My only complaint is that the 5.0 was not very spicy, but I can't really tell anymore."}
{"text":"I got a to-go order of their perfectly made and delicious Pad Won Sen.  There's so many Thai places that don't really have the spice scale set up and I am glad Chanpen does.  But their mild is more like medium and their medium is more like HOT!  So be forewarned.  This place might be a hole in the wall, but don't let it fool you.  Their dishes are definitely well done and super tasty for sure.  While I was waiting for my order they were also nice enough to give me some bottled water to sip on.  Score a brownie point on the customer service scale!"}
{"text":"Incredibly authentic, fresh, and flavorful Thai food. I eat here once a week, minimum. Do yourself a favor and try all of the curries ... You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place as soon as you walk in and me sit down you get served the lunch soup at lunch time and you are off to lunch menu and they have wonderful T in appetizers great little hole in the wall and they do pick up so you can call in your order"}
{"text":"Dinner was great, food was high quality as usual.  Just awkward having server Kieran literally try and yank the itemized receipt out of my hand which I needed for business purposes.  2 stars for ending our dinner out experience badly."}
{"text":"Ok, you need to understand the meaning of what many of us lovingly refer to as a Shi!hole.  To me that means it is extraordinarily unimpressive visually but extraordinarily impressive in how good the food is.  While there is of course some variance on both of the factors the perfect place, again to me, is one that truly is a Shi!hole (like really not good) but the food may be off the chain. Made with talent, love and a gift to your mouth.    This place is textbook.  A total dive and tiny TINY but...  the BEST Thai in all of Phoenix.  Yes, you heard me right.  The BEST in Phoenix.  (They have a nicer location - not quite as good but very very close) same name - on 48th st and Ray in South Phoenix.    Go.  Just Go!"}
{"text":"tiny restaurant (6 tables!) but extraordinarily attentive and friendly waitstaff.  We tried this place out on a drive through town based on the reviews and were not disappointed.  We had the Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai (2 heat) and Combination Meat Fried Rice (3 heat) and it took just a bit to notice the heat in the pad thai but it was there and the rice was plenty spicy for us who both enjoy moderately hot to hot dishes.  Everything tasted great and plenty of water and even complimentary green tea ice cream to finish."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, I have become a regular since moving nearby. Service is always prompt, polite, efficient. The food is always fresh, quick, and DELICIOUS. I almost always order the yellow royal curry with chicken, with 4/5 heat level. The spring rolls are also very good. I have tried the red curry and enjoyed it as well, but my favorite is the yellow royal curry. The staff is also what makes this place great, they treat the customers well and even offer complimentary ice cream!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the exterior. This tiny place doesn't look like much from the outside, but we are so glad we gave it a chance. Great food, fast service, very reasonably priced. Will definitely visit again when in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Wow I am so impressed. I love Thai food, and this place really got my taste buds excited. When I was done with my entree, I was quite sa-Thai-sfied, and then they brought out the complimentary green tea ice cream dessert.   I will definitely go back and I highly recommend you do too!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we stumbled upon this little Thai restaurant! Hands down the best pad see ew we've ever had, by far. The lunch special is great as it comes with soup, wonton, egg roll & the entree. Service is hit or miss but can usually be in & out fairly quickly. I've also tried the pad Thai but nothing comes close to the pad see ew here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place serves some pretty amazing Thai food!! I go here on my lunch break and order the red curry lunch special...... OMG soooooooooooo yummy! You get a crunchy spring roll, a couple of fried wontons, and that CURRY!!! The rice is fluffy and breaks apart right on the plate! The curry is just amazing and I love the staff! Go here!"}
{"text":"The food here is really well done.  I was a little disappointed to find out that, even though the menu online and in the restaurant still show them, they no longer serve scallops.  The service was pretty good too.  We had yellow curry with chicken and spicy eggplant with pork.  Both were very flavorful with fresh ingredients.  The portion sizes were great for the price.  Also, the included ice cream desert was an amazing surprise.  I look forward to my return trip."}
{"text":"For my second visit, I had Yellow Curry off the lunch menu. A nice, small soup is included.  SO good and only for $5.95. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about the lunch I had today- the Da Nang Curry with chicken and crab puffs.  It was a huge portion and I thought I'd have to get a to-go box, but no!  The food was so good that there was no need.  This place is my new go-to for Thai Food.  Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"This Thai place is the best!  If you're looking for that true hole-in-the-wall place with amazing food, this is the place.  The service is super friendly and quick.  I recommend the coconut soup.  Literally the best Thai food I have tried in the greater Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. The food quality is superior, their service is amazing, and their menu is large for selections and taste variances amongst fellow diners. This is truly a \"HOLE IN THE WALL\""}
{"text":"Best Place in the area! I'll been going to all kinds of restaurants all over the valley & this family owned business is the best! Don't let the appearance fool you, the food is 5 star & with excellent customer service as well! Not over priced like most restaurants, perfect for take out! Hope the debit/credit machine starts to work again!"}
{"text":"Just visiting Phoenix for a week and was in need of some good Thai-style curry.  This place has solid, traditional homestyle Thai food served by very sweet people.  The restaurant is small and out of the way.  The green curry with chicken was delicious, just the right consistency of curry broth, super fresh veggies and tender flakes of chicken served over yummy rice.  I had the Mango juice with it, and they treated me to a scoop of Green Tea ice cream afterwards because it was so hot outside."}
{"text":"This location is way easier to get a seat at then the Broadway location.  The service was pretty good.  Only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the uncomfortable seating.  Did not care for the hard/short booth at all.  The coconut soup is the bomb. The eggplant with tofu is delicious.  We got a heat level 2 and I think next time we will stick to a 1 because it was just a pinch to hot for our tastes."}
{"text":"Absolutely authentic! Great flavor. Tremendous portions. Fast service top notch quality product. Yea, the exterior maybe less than desirable, but the hearts on the inside are the character of the food that is being delivered table side.  I spent a month in Thailand, and this is as good as the motherland. I live in Las Vegas and would day trip here just to visit this place again."}
{"text":"The food is bomb, the customer service is great and the staff is personable. The hole in the wall vibe had me worried at first but I've grown to love it. I've tried the crab puffs, chicken wings, pineapple rice and the pa nang curry + broccoli and none have let me down. Thai iced tea is my go-to and the complimentary ice cream at the end is the perfect touch. Absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Called to order the pad thai from the lunch menu that comes with shrimp and chicken for $6.50. I asked for tofu instead of chicken. They asked how spicy I wanted and I asked for medium. When I picked up, I was charged $2 extra because they gave me tofu and extra shrimp instead of chicken. The server was apologetic about charging it. Ok, fine although I would appreciate being informed when I placed the order. When I opened it, there was no tofu, 4 shrimps in it, and not spicy at all. My friend also asked for medium spicy on her pad thai and it was not spicy at all. So why bother asking how spicy we wanted? The noodle is a bit soggy but pretty good overall. Since it's nearby my office and there's no other Thai place nearby, I will give it another try. Please do not disappoint me the second time."}
{"text":"Average food average prices . Probably won't go back staff we're not that friendly and messed up our bill.  Food mediocre at best.  Made me appreciate my regular Thai restaurant so much more"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner - don't let the location put you off. It's off the beaten path surrounded by business-park-y type buildings. Food was amazing - we got the pad thai, pad see ew, and the panang curry. All were great but the curry was my favorite - smooth, unctuous, and you could really taste the lime leaf. Big portions for a great price.  Beware the levels of spiciness - it goes 0 to 5 and 3 was almost too spicy for most of us. 4 and 5 are probably best saved for folks who have grown up with true levels of Thai spiciness.  Service was really good. I'm the type of person who gets fussy when my water glass isn't refilled almost constantly and here the refills were constant and unobtrusive."}
{"text":"Cannot believe I have not been here to write a review sooner.    Let me put it simple, my S.O. and I will just give each other a look, and we know we are off to Chan Pen.  I love everything, but especially the crab rangoons (the BEST I have ever had), green pineapple curry with duck, panang, pad thai, the list goes on.  The owner works his butt off and is in there almost every day of the week, and yet is always happy and kind.  Just super delicious and a better atmosphere for a restaurant than the old location (if just taking out, both locations are equally fantastic).    Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very tasty thai food. They make the curry base from the scratch, so they are able to accommodate vegetarian preferences. They have complimentary ice cream for the dinners!"}
{"text":"I always wonder who the people are that leave one star ratings on restaurants with overwhelmingly positive remarks from other reviewers. Like, were they just having a bad day? Or is the universe out to get them?   Whatever their misfortune, I can say that my first experience with Chanpen was quite fortunate indeed. I was stuck at home all day with a cold and wanted Thai food desperately. I've literally lived in South Phoenix for 4 years and have never tried this place! I called to order take out and it was ready in 15-20 min.   It was easy to locate and the place was quaint and cute inside. The woman who answered the phone was the same person at the counter and she was quite nice. She gave me a complimentary bottle of water with my order.   I got green curry, because it's my favorite Thai dish and I am very picky about it. The only other place in town I like is Thai Basil on University. But, the green curry at Chanpen was delicious! It was thick and creamy, just as I like it. And the vegetables were cooked to perfection. I ordered a mild spiciness and it came just perfectly for me. Great first impression. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So we were on our way to Sedona and looked up a place close enough to airport and  drove here. Was surprised to see that it was a hole in the wall and we could barely find place to fit in. I doubt it can seat more than 20 people.  The guy taking orders was very nice and helpful. The food was of course very good and more than enough in serving size. What stood out was that the place kept getting  progressively crowded with people coming in more for take out than sit-in orders. Spoke highly of the place. Should never miss it if you like thai food made right - Perfect !"}
{"text":"Seeing that it had good reviews on Yelp, we decided to check this place out after a long and arduous day. At first sight, the place certainly looked a little run down, however the service and the food were certainly delectable. We shared the seafood soup hot pot, which had a familiar and sharp zing to it. We enjoyed our food and the dining experience here. Just look past the sparse décor and ambiance, and you'll have a good thai meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Up in Phoenix for a conference. We love Thai food but have usually been unlucky in our past choices. Went to chanpen and the food was delicious. Will definitely come back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Been here twice already, and have never been disappointed by their food. Have tried drunken noodles, red curry, and pad thai. All very consistent and not overwhelmingly sweet like other Thai places tend to do. Excellent and genuine service - at one point they even offered my friend and me 2 bottles of water for free when we left. The place is small (probably 4-5 tables at most) but fret not my friends, consider doing take outs! Price is so reasonable that you'll want to eat all 3 meals there. Cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Just as wonderful as their Broadway location, but more convenient to stop in.  Highly recommend, but make sure you pay attention to which location you've called when ordering ahead :D"}
{"text":"I adore this place.  Their food is amazing and the staff is friendly.  There really is nothing more to say than that.  Just wonderful."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST restaurant in this area!  We went on Father's Day and it was the perfect place to go as it wasn't overly crowded.  There are only 5 tables in the entire restaurant so it is SMALL.  The bathroom is strange and dingy but the food and the service makes up for it.  Maybe I should back up.  We ordered the egg rolls and the spring rolls.  They were not good.  The veggie spring rolls were actually not good at all.  Was like a cheap wilting bag of lettuce/carrot mix from the grocery store rolled up.  I only ate half of one.  Then came out the food.  My girls were sharing a tofu pad thai.  It smelled DISGUSTING.  I think maybe I am just not a fan of pad thai?  My husband got the chicken sweet basil heat #5 and was in heaven.  My son got the red pineapple curry with beef heat #3 and very much enjoyed it.  I had the eggplant with tofu heat #1 and it was seriously AMAZING.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  Then for dessert we were brought out complimentary green tea iced cream and fried bananas.  They are so good!  I could never eat here again and not order them.  I keep thinking about them 2 days later!!"}
{"text":"I've seen the high reviews and decided to check it out for lunch. I ordered my favorite Thai dish, red curry, which I use to compare restaurants. I was disappointed. To start, the spring roll was no spring roll, it was cold and very small, with practically no stuffing, just fried dough. The red curry was ok, not great. On the positive side, the waitress was friendly and welcoming. The place was clean."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time the other day after shopping at Frys. The food was delicious and the wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! You feel like family as soon as you walk in. They have been here less then a year but the spices and the food quality will blow your mind. Home made ice cream was fantastic. I can't wait for their sake bombs to be available! What a great experience. I will be back most definitely."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai food in Phx! So authentic, the food brought back some great memories of being in Thailand! Don't be fooled by its appearance. This place is a hidden gem and I send all my friends here."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find a gem where you may not be looking. Chanpen Thai is just that gem. Trust me, this place isn't really the place you view as being the beautiful one and it may throw you off by its seedy location. But, it's a true find and it has some of THE best thai food and service in the valley of the sun! Chanpen is very small and has only a few tables; you are greeted warmly with complimentary green tea ice cream or coconut ice cream and offered a drink, even for take out while you wait! There are daily specials that seem seasonal and the service is always with a friendly smile and helpful explanation, if need be. I've had the Penang Green Curry here with Chicken, ( my personal favorite !) ; The Pineapple Fried Rice is a large portion and great for sharing ; Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp; the Coconut Soup is loaded with fresh ingredients and perfect when you are under the weather or on a chilly winter day! I've never had a mediocre meal here. Everything is amazing! There are always leftovers too.. which I love! Most items are $10 and under!! You can vary the spice level and I go with a 3-4 and find myself grabbing tissues for the basic in me. But the heat level is never overpowering of the flavors. If you choose to dine in, there are only about 3-4 tables and no alcohol is served , but you can seemingly BYOB.  This particular location, ( there is a nicer and larger one located on Baseline Road), is my favorite. It may leave little to be desired on 'looks' from the parking lot to the street,  but it's huge on .. it's personality and that's what counts , right ? A diamond in the rough awaits your Thai desires right here !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm really glad they are able to expand. It's the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix. The owners are so kind and friendly as well. I've had the pad thai, spring rolls, and many of their curries."}
{"text":"I just want to say that the food is amazing and the workers are excellent hosts who are very friendly. Just come check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Had a great time there. A really small restraint but amazing food. If you are not familiar with a lot of spiciness stick to 1 or 2 as it gets really hot really fast. The pad Thai was great."}
{"text":"I and my siblings and their families have loved every dish we've eaten here. The food is just great!  The restaurant itself is an old house that has been renovated. There's not much room for when they're busy. So, I'd leave yourself the option of ordering to go and eating at someone's house or patio. Regardless, the food is worth waiting for a seat or takin food home.  The staff is very nice, and they do feel bad when they can't seat everyone, but that's beyond their control. And quite frankly, I wouldn't want them to have a huge location only because I think it could change the quality of their food by doing so."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and had two different curry dishes. Both were excellent. Will come here again on my next trip to Phoenix"}
{"text":"I normally hate eating out because I don't think the cost justifies the food. This place is the opposite. I had the drunken noodles, pad Thai, pad see ew. All were delicious. And when I asked for spicy, they GAVE me spicy.   And the people that worked there were courteous and polite.   I will recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was in AZ for a conference and was looking for a Thai place close to my hotel. THis place was right around the corner from the Arizona Grand so I went for it. Now, I am a huge fan of Thai food if it is done right. If it is done wrong I despise it. I walked in this place, got seated right away, ordered a Thai tea (the tea was on my table within 1 minute), ordered  Pad thai with chicken and shrimp (the food was made and on my table in about 8 minutes). It was SO GOOD!  Fun, fast, and friendly service!  OH! And they gave me some complimentary coconut ice cream when they brought me my check. Does not get any better!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai place in a very random location! We got the red curry, drunken noodles, and Tom yum, all were really good, the only complaint I have is that spiciness was a bit off for my taste, Thai hot is QUITE spicy but we also got a couple dishes at 4 spiciness and it only had a teeny bit of spice"}
{"text":"Everything that I tried was amazing. The service was spectacular. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! It is a tiny hole in the wall with amazing food and very fair prices. I very highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"On a visit from Houston, we wanted some Thai food and ended up finding this fantastic restaurant through others on Yelp! This place is a small and non-descript place....don't judge the look of the place. This restaurant has some great food! We ordered the chicken basil with vegetables, pad thai, yellow curry, egg plant stir fry and spicy chicken fried rice. All of the dishes were delicious. Not only was the food great, but everyone was very nice!"}
{"text":"Great spot, great food, small parking, but most people stop by for pickup so spots are there.  Great service!!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the location or lack of seating. The food and service is amazing. Even with a full house we only waited 10 min, which I needed more to peruse the menu, then were seated and received our food shortly, fresh and hot."}
{"text":"To start, this is definitely a hole in the wall! Came here after helping my daughter and her husband move into thier new home. So kinda fit the bill, as we were all tired and grimy. We had a party of eight which took up about half the rstrnt. The food was delicious! The appetizers and pad thai, crispy chicken was spot on!!!  The fried rice was good."}
{"text":"Come. Eat. Repeat.  After a late flight into PHX we were craving some good Thai. With most of my favorite options closing before we could get there, I turned to Yelpers for guidance. You did well, young padawans!  I grew up in this area and have seen this space change hands over and over. I'm excited to see Chanpen take the corner of a dingy strip mall to new culinary levels!  The food was hot, fresh, and delicious. Spice levels 1-5 and our '4's of drunken noodles and curry dishes left us with a satisfying belly-warming sensation, just the way we like it! Portions were large enough that I had lunch for several days - bonus! There were several specials on the board that sounded fantastic (pumpkin curry!) but sadly not enough room to try them all. Which just means we'll have to come back!  Reasonable prices, comfortable seating, attentive service. One complaint - the menu is REALLY hard to read. Please calm down with the background graphics. It will make it much easier on the eyes."}
{"text":"I've never had a craving for Thai food. I've eaten it many times, but nothing has ever wow'd me to a point where I'd ever think, \"I'm in the mood for Thai today.\" But I think my meal at Chanpen might have changed that for me.   I went with a friend last week and we got a yellow curry, red curry, and their pad thai (sorry can't remember the dish numbers). Though the red curry was good and the pad thai was great, what blew me away was their yellow curry. Definitely one of the best Asian dishes I've had in AZ for a long time.   They also surprised us with green tea ice cream at the end! Bruh. 5 stars, easy. I'll be back soon, next time with more friends."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best Thai food I have ever had. The rating is on food alone.   My group of friends and I had the PaNang Curry, Yellow Curry, Pad See Ew, and Pad Thai. The curry came with a bowl of rice and the Pad Thai had bean sprouts, a lime wedge, and crushed peanuts on the side. All dishes were excellent.  Each plate's price ranges depending on the meat choice ordered. Chicken and vegetarian, for instance, is the cheapest. Seafood makes your order slightly pricier.  My friends ordered Thai iced tea and the tea to milk ratio was great. The cup was filled with tea and they added a splash of milk.   When you're done with your meal, they then bring out a small single scoop of what I believe was coconut-pineapple ice cream. That was a sweet surprise.  The downside from this place was how ghetto the building was. It is so inconspicuous and had a lot of flies inside. I didn't want to use the bottled hot sauce because we saw a fly dive in."}
{"text":"I'm an OG. I knew about this place when they use to be in that small house.  Now they've upgraded to Baseline/48th.  Same great staff and food.  Quite honestly, this is the best Thai in town.  I'm asian, believe me.    I am however not a big fan of a lot of space.  I like favor, and I like spice, but not overwhelming.  If you are the same, start at a 1 (5 being the spiciest)."}
{"text":"This a hole in the wall treasure! They have impeccable service, give great recommendations and make you feel like family. The food is A1, you can close your eyes and randomly pick something off the menu and know it will taste amazinh. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Best Asian Fast Food in the neighborhood! Pad Thai is the best in Arizona. Most places don't come close!"}
{"text":"Was so good, my boyfriend asked for the best seller and the lady recommended the garlic beef I think that's what it's called but it was supper good with the fried rice we got. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I order chicken and shrimp pad thai togo. came home and open the box, all I see is noodle, chickens and bean sprouts. did they forget the shrimps??? the chickens are dry and the noodle is mushy. will not order again"}
{"text":"Cute,  quiet place to have a nice date =) very intimate, don't expect to have a party here.  The food was amazing; potstickers, panang curry,  Thai iced Tea, duck pineapple curry and delicious coconut pineapple ice cream to finish it all off! My hubby is now officially in a food coma, lol, and I've found my new favorite thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Place is the spot..  Best Thai food I have had in Phoenix..  Other than being a small restaurant..  It is definitely worth it :)"}
{"text":"I have lived next to this restaurant for 3 years and I've never really noticed it until I saw it on yelp and man this restaurant is amazing!! Even my little girl loved it she finished her whole plate! This is now my go to spot!! YOU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great Thai food, but don't care what the place looks it, then Chanpen is for you! The restaurant is tiny inside, and it doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is wonderful! The dishes are authentic Thai, and they always taste great! The service is quick and friendly. I highly recommend this place. It is our go-to location for delicious Thai!"}
{"text":"This place is a small hole in the wall but it is amazing Great customer service and the food is delicious everything I try is good.   If you are in the area come try it out"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special.  It is tiny and only 6 tables available for dine in. We had to wait about 10 minutes but not bad at all. Seems they do a big takeout business. We ordered the yellow curry chicken, red curry chicken, chicken satay and Thai iced tea. All of it was very flavorful. The lunch special came with soup, spring roll and a few wonton chips. We ordered spice at 3 stars and it was definitely some heat but not too hot. I'd definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! Quick and great service, very clean, and food was awesome! Recommend the panang curry alongside the pad Thai! Enjoy everyone!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food prepared as you order, very friendly atmosphere and extremely accommodating to changes requested. Clearly our Thai restaurant of choice in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food 5 Bay Area/DC transplants with high expectations. Went here based on other Yelp suggestions and it completely lived up to expectations and more. Recommend the Pad See Ew and Pineapple Fried Rice.  Atmosphere/Service 5 Placed an order to go and was told to return in about 20 minutes to pick up order. Drove back home with order only to realize 2 orders of spring rolls were missing from the bag. Luckily we live close by, we went back and they quickly realized the mistake, made two fresh orders and gave us complimentary thai iced teas. Excellent service and location."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had in my life. Very affordable, nicest staff, I hate that I live so far away. Their pumpkin curry is my favorite and I always get all their curries on level 5 heat."}
{"text":"It's remarkable this place has such high ratings.  Food is awful.  Ordered a beef salad, my usual go to for Thai food. They told me the beef salad wasn't available so I had the chicken salad.  It was iceberg lettuce covered with ground chicken and cilantro...that's it.  My daughter had shrimp fried rice, very bland. Husband had red curry chicken, so spicy that it was difficult to eat.  We're from LA where we have authentic, amazing Thai food, this place does not even deserve 1 star in my honest opinion."}
{"text":"I've never had meat here,  but the tofu and veggie curries are just effin' good.     Polite and friendly people here too and the prices are right."}
{"text":"Stopped by Phoenix while heading back to Cali and thought we would stop by an check it out because the reviews weren't bad. Luckily we made it just in time for the lunch special and got their yellow curry & pad Thai and I really liked the food! It was really good!"}
{"text":"After two visits I'm still undecided between 4 and 5 stars this place is a solid four stars at least. This is a very TINY place that isn't fancy and only has a few tables but also serves very above average Thai Food.  We tried the Chicken Pot Stickers. They were packed full of tasty seasoned moist Chicken and were fried crispy in clean tasting oil.  My husband had the Sweet Basil Duck and ordered it at a 4 level heat out of 5. The Moist Rich Duck was Roasted and then added into the flavorful Fiery Sauce and with Crunchy Colorful Vegetables. This dish was excellent and was a bargain at the (I think) $10.99 Price.  I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken also at a heat level of 4 out of 5. I received a very Velvety Well Balanced Aromatic Sauce also with crunchy fresh vegetables but with not bad but slightly dry chicken. It didn't come out as spicy as I wanted it because it was close to being mild but I thought it was still delicious and I would still order it again.   They surprised us with complimentary ice cream.   The Owner/Chef Personally Thanked Every Single Person for Coming In.  A really Good Place for Thai Food.... Shame it's not an area I normally can go to or I'd go more often.  A true 4.5"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Have been twice in the past week now that we have found this place. Pad Thai is my favorite of anywhere I have tried it and the coconut soup is amazing (plus the flaming bowl it comes in is pretty cool).  Small location but that really makes it a good neighborhood spot.   Worth a look if you are ready for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Their food is Amazing. My favorite dish the coconut soup w seafood. EXQUISITE !!!! So full of flavor"}
{"text":"There is one server (male) who is AMAZING. The rest of the staff is meh but get the job done. The food is priced right and delicious."}
{"text":"The pineapple red curry and drunken noodles are excellent. The hotness scale really varies depending on the chef. I've had 5's that were mild and 4's that have blown my mind but I still love this place."}
{"text":"For never having their food in my life this place was pretty good. The customer service was excellent. We arrived at about 7:30, when they closed at 8. We were immediately treated by the nice cashier. We decided to take the food to go since they would be closing soon. They had options on how hot you wanted your food. On a scale of one to 10 which I thought was great. However, I did not like the drunken noodles. It may be because I have never had this food before. But other than that the wontons and everything else was really good!"}
{"text":"Was back here again!! This is the best place for Thai.. Love the food and the service :) 27th St and Broadway!!"}
{"text":"They have the best coconut soup. If I could I would eat it every day. Every time we go we try something new and everytime it has been very good. The staff is very friendly and they are very nice. The restaurant is clean they really do a great job."}
{"text":"I have no clue how people are giving this place such raving reviews, it's almost like they've never had good authentic Thai food. To start with, the place is a whole in the wall with almost no parking, so the stress and annoyance of getting jammed in to a parking during lunch is not worth it. I went there at 11:25 PM on a Wednesday and it was packed. I ordered egg rolls and chicken pad thai. The place is so small, you're running in to every human being, every purse, every chair- it's a circus. There's no place to stand and order or to wait- unless you want to wait outside in the heat. I waited 50 minutes. This might have been worth it if the food was good but it was the worst  Thai food I'd ever tasted. The pad thai was bland- didn't have any flavor and was missing essential ingredients- no peanuts, green onions, bean sprouts, etc. The rolls were even worse- they were basically empty but even the pastry part wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend coming here ever. There are tons of other good Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai food in phoenix right now. Chanpen on Broadway and the sister location on Baseline are amazing.  The Broadway location is my favorite because there is just something special about the food that comes out of that little unassuming building on the side of the road. However once you walk in and smell all those great thai flavors (curry, lemongrass, coconut, basil).  I have tried a bunch of different dishes here but my favorites are the Coconut Soup and Panang Curry along with the spring rolls. The coconut soup is one of my go to's on cold nights or when I am not feeling good. It's go such great aromatics and the combo of the spice with the sweet coconut is just great. I prefer mine with chicken which comes apart easy but the beef is good too and adds a bit more chew. The panang is awesome with the nutty spicy flavor. The sauce is good over just some rice. The spring rolls are a great little warm up to the main meal. They are pretty large for spring rolls with the fresh veggies and some good sized shrimp, the dipping sauce I can't get enough of either. I like that with their spring rolls the shrimp never have that weird overly shrimpy taste and aren't over cooked.  I've also had some of the other curry's, the larb salad, pad thai (girlfriends favorite) and a bunch of others and nothing has been a let down. So feel free to explore the menu.  The other big thing is service, the people here a great. I have only ever done takeout because it's so small inside but everyone is always friendly and are quick to hand you a bottle of water every time. A couple times when my order wasn't quite ready they have given me some green tea ice cream while I wait, totally unnecessary but a nice gesture.   For takeout they do one thing that I think is key for a place of this size which does takeout a lot, they package it up well. Everything is well secured and even when I am ordering soup I am never really worried about spills and leaks.  Protip: Ask about the specials when you call in they have some great seasonal dishes."}
{"text":"Great little spot, very friendly staff and fantastic Thai dishes. My wife and I loved it, price is very reasonable too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food! The service can be a bit slow at lunch, but the food is too good to even really be mad about it."}
{"text":"We've been fortunate to find two completely different yet exceptional Thai places in Phoenix/Scottsdale. This little hole in the wall is one of our favorite restaurants we've ever eaten at in any city. Highly recommend the Panang & the special Avocado Green Curry!"}
{"text":"I started with their egg rolls which were the plumpest and most delicious I have tasted. The spicy plum sauce for dipping was excellent as well. For my entree I had the Ma-Sa Mun Curry spiced to a level 2 (0-5). It was plenty spicy and so flavorful. I definitely plan to eat here again the next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Some of the best tom ka gai I've ever had. Huge portions and really good quality. They gave us a cup of coconut ice cream with pineapple at the end of our meal, which appears to be homemade. All in all very good stuff!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! This is spicy little nugget of tastiness is a surprising bit of heaven in an unexpected location. Dishes are fresh and made to your desired level of spiciness. Thai food is at it's best at Chanpen. The service is impeccable. The sweet young waitress even brought over an orange, neatly and decoratively cut for my toddler when she noticed the food was too spicy for the tot. She then brought a bit of candy for my older daughters once they had finished their respective plates (first checking with me if that was okay). In spite of the small dining space, this has to be one of the best restaurants I've dined at in a long time. I'd give it five stars if it was only a bit bigger. That's the only caveat with this place."}
{"text":"The pad Thai at this restaurant is okay. It is not as amazing as everyone is stating. The tofu is overly cooked. The staff is very nice and responsive but the food didn't impress me at all."}
{"text":"I love the local mom and pop shops with excellent food. This is certainly one that I will be visiting over and over. Was packed at noon, so got it to go and will be calling in and ordering ahead of time going forward since the chances of getting a lunch seat do not seem to be very high.   Enjoyed chicken and shrimp Pad Thai level 3, and will likely kick it up to a 4 next time. Treasure near work, and a new lunch fav."}
{"text":"I tried Chanpen after reading the positive reviews here and wow, great hidden gem!  I did a takeout order of Yellow Chicken Curry, which wasn't on their menu, but they were accommodating, Salad rolls and chown mein thai style noodles.  They need to put it on the menu because the chicken was tender, the sauce was creamy, fragrant, sweet and spicy to our liking.  It was a generous portion for the price. The salad rolls with shrimp were hefty with lettuce, bean sprouts and shrimp wrapped in rice paper.  A meal in itself, but that didn't stop me from trying the other entrees and finishing everyone else's remaining morsels!  Now because the noodles were in a styrofoam to go container, it wasn't airtight so the sauce spilled out into the plastic carrying bag as it was driving home.  That was a downer, but the yakisoba noodles were covered with carrots, onions, crunchy cabbage, lots of tender chicken slices.  My kids would have liked more noodles but it was enough for 3 kids. No leftovers after this takeout adventure! So this was a successful Friday find! Yeah. I think the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated with booths and tables.  The service was fine.  Sorry no pics since we were super hungry and it smelled so diviine I forgot to take pics."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is nice and the pad-see was amazeballs! Also they give you coconut ice cream at no charge  and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Chapen is a cute little ma & pop type Thai place. I was staying at a hotel by the airport and was in dire need of a restaurant for dinner and i found Chapen on Yelp with 5 star reviews.  You wouldn't expect it to be a restaurant, it looks like it should be a house. There are only 6 tables and the whole family works the restaurant and the food is excellent. I ordered the Massaman Curry and it was great. They have us complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of the meal and even a free bottle of water while we waited for our cab to pick us up."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pad thai I've had in Arizona, hands down. I've had pad thai throughout Phoenix and Tucson probably 8 times in the past 3 months and found myself consistently disappointed. I just landed at Phoenix Airport and was starving. It just so happened that Chanpen Thai Cuisine was the closest Thai restaurant- thank goodness. Because I was there on a Monday during lunch hours, I got a free soup, egg roll, and wonton chips, all very delicious. There were probably 4 other parties aside from me yet my food came out within 6-8 minutes- impressive. On a scale of 1-5 for spiciness, I got a 3 and was very pleased. I always feel like I'm playing Goldilocks and the three bears when it comes to my heat, but this was absolutely perfect. The best part of the pad thai had to be the chewiness. I just can't say enough about it. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Go here.  Vey creamy coconut curry. cucumber waters. Nice service. Not expensive. Really into this spot."}
{"text":"Went with a group of five, we were wondering why it was little slow on Saturday night but our dinner turned out great: best Thai food, complimentary coconut ice-cream, reasonable price, great service,.... what can you ask more? So HAPPY!"}
{"text":"Service was not the most friendly, but the food was good and the lemon grass soup had a great presentation. See photo"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever! I never cared for Thai food until I ate here! It is amazing! The pad thai is my favorite thing there. Do yourself a favor and try it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom and son. The place does not disappoint! The staff is very kind and attentive. Our waitress was very patient as we asked her questions about the menu. We got the drunken noodles and lemongrass soup with Chicken. The food was great and we had plenty of leftovers. Doesn't look like much from the outside but would highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food - we go to this place pretty often from my office.  Their Red and Yellow Curry is awesome... great flavor."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the better dining experience I've had since moving to Arizona from California. There weren't that many tables filled, but the customer service was very attentive and conversational, so the vibe of this place was causal and welcoming. The food was also amazing. I typically get Pad See Yew at Thai restaurants and it was one of the best I've had, and the best I've had in Arizona. Then my boyfriend got the Panang curry and it was so nutty and flavorful, I almost regretted getting Pad See Yew. And to top off this great dining experience, they gave us green tea ice cream. And it didn't taste store bought either. The only thing I would criticize is that they didn't really give us or offer usual condiments I've had at Thai restaurants, like fish sauce with Thai chiles, or little jalapeños with soy sauce, and etc."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! The food is insane! Amazing Pad Thai, and the coconut shrimp hot pot is so tasty! I tend to get the level 3 heat, and it's perfectly hot! I need to try more things, but I just love what I have gotten in the past, so that's so hard to do!  They always end your meal with a free ice cream, and it's delicious! The atmosphere is cool and unassuming, and the staff are very friendly and attentive. A must try for Thai lovers!"}
{"text":"I stopped because I was in the area. It is in a very transitional neighborhood. Yelp reviews were good so I stopped for a late lunch. The seating is minimal so I got it to go. While I waited a very short time I was given a complimentary bottle of water and a small bowl of delicious cabbage soup. Everyone was very welcoming and the service was fast. I will have to review the take out food later.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Man, I love Thai food. So much diversity and layer after layer of texture and flavor; all with just the right spice. Chanpen does not skimp when it comes to flavor. Their food was delicious. Excellent. I got two entrees just so I'd have those coveted Thai leftovers when the midnight munchies kick in. Panang Curry and Pad See Ew.   This place could definitely use a bit more night time ambiance. The overhead fluorescent lights were a bit distracting and sterile. If they had some softer lighting dispersed through the restaurant, that would take this place to another level. Some soft music would be a plus too! All that stuff doesn't really matter though cause the food was so good.  The service was slow and a bit inattentive, but once the food came out, I stopped caring real quick. I had stepped into another world. After my meal, I was brought some complementary and homemade coconut-pineapple ice cream. F@*$ing delicious. Thank you Chanpen. I will be back. I will bring my money.  Food-wise, this place is easily among the top Thai restaurants here in Arizona. I may have to find a way to marry into the family."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal!!! Drunken noodles and pad Thai were a wonderful meal. The Thai hot tea was excellent!!"}
{"text":"So ran across this by accident looking for chicken wings.   Yelped chicken wings and it came up.  Figured what the hell,  why not.   Ordered the wings,  crispy,  not oily, really good flavor and figured the rest of the dishes must be as good.   Wow ... ordered a yellow curry plate and a rice noodle dish.   Both amazing.   One of the best Thai places we have found so far.  Bad for us that it's  so far from where we live but close to where the little lady works.   Ill have to remain on good behavior so she surprises me once in a while with a nice Thai dinner."}
{"text":"Best Thai food. Fresh food. I have been here for so many times. Everything so wonderful. I had Tom Yum soup with Seafood, Pad Thai, Basil Fish, and Curry duck. OMG food was amazing and tasty. Service was friendly. They give me complimentary ice cream!! Love Chanpen Thai   Authentic and Delicious Thai food. Great Service. Big and beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Beautiful restaurant. Same owner of the Chanpen on Broadway! I tried their delicious rainbow sticky rice and the chicken angel wings! Most definitely going to be back to try more of their exceptional food!"}
{"text":"So I find this place very close to my work and excited to get some Thai food.  I decided to stop by and just pick up food to go.  The place is very small, maybe 4 tables at most.  I placed my order and waited for 40 minutes to find out that they hadn't even started my with my order.  I asked a gentleman sitting there and he stated that he had only been there twice and waited for a lengthy time for his food as well.  I ran out of time so I cancelled my order.  I'm sure that the food is good I just don't have hours to spend for lunch."}
{"text":"Pad Thai with shrimp...by far my favorite Thai dish, and this place knocks it out of the park! Don't get me wrong everything else on the menu is just as good...if you are visiting Phoenix then this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food place in Phoenix hands down! Always call to pick up and they're always super busy but friendly regardless! Love their Pad - See - Ew, Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai & Panang Curry lunch specials."}
{"text":"A hidden GEM! This is the BEST Thai restaurants in Arizona.   My husband ordered the Seafood Combo Hot Pot and I ordered the Chicken Pad-See-Yew and both dishes are to die for. The combination of all the herb and spices are perfect.   The staff is wonderful, always welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch since we were in the neighborhood. We were promptly shown to our table. The waiter was friendly and polite. However, he did not use pen and paper to write down our order.   The chicken coconut soup was savory, with the right amount of seasonings and spices. It was enough for at least 3 people.   My wife ordered the yellow curry with beef. Since the waiter did not write it down, he gave us yellow curry with chicken instead. This dish was OK; nothing outstanding about it.   We ordered sticky rice and mango for dessert. This dish was good. The right amount of sweetness coupled with some tartness from the fruity mango.  If we are in that neighborhood, we may stop by again."}
{"text":"Meh ... fast and friendly ... not the best Thai in the area."}
{"text":"No frills, no fuss, no need to worry because the proof is in the curry, and the hot pots, and probably even the noodles, for that matter! Yes, the neighborhood looks sketchy; yes, it's tiny; yes, it's definitely worth the stop. The hot pot soup was fantastic, and the lemongrass flavor was nicely balanced in the fragrant, warm, happy bowl. This is the sort of soup that could inspire good haikus. Yum! The coconut curry was appropriately spicy with a good amount of sweetness, and I thoroughly appreciate they WILL make the dish spicy when you indicate your spice level desired."}
{"text":"Chanpen has been a long time favorite of mine. The food is consistently great and the service is mostly dependable. What I really want to highlight here is the lunch special. They know what they're doing with their lunch service. They understand how people that work in nearby offices want to get in and out on their lunch breaks and they do it better than anywhere else! They are so fast and efficient at lunch time. I will always recommend this place for excellent food and service, but there is simply no beating their lunchtime hustle to get you fed in a reasonable amount of time. Definitely consider this for your next lunch meeting!"}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted writing this because this is close to the top of my list of hole in the wall Thai places. Last time I was there, they left their health department paperwork sitting plainly on the counter where you pay and pickup to go food. I could see clearly that they were cited for not washing hands or having hand washing areas in food prep spaces. The disregard for 1. Leaving those citations sitting out for anyone to see (this information does not need to be displayed by law, only the Letter rating does) and 2. Not washing hands which is a simple thing to do, both shock me and gross me out. It will be a little bit of time before I decide to visit here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Used to work down the street and this is what i miss the most. Tried several other Thai restaurants near where I live in North Scottsdale, but no one comes close. Best Pad Thai ever!"}
{"text":"We came in and ordered take out because we had our puppy with us. We ordered 3 plates and went to sit down and wait. While we waited they were kind enough to bring us some bottled water and some homemade coconut ice cream. I'm not a fan of coconut and I didn't want to be rude so I ate a few bites and gave my daughter the rest. It tastes good but I'd like it better with out the coconut flakes. If it didn't have that I'd eat the whole thing but keep in mind that I'm. It a fan of coconut but my daughter loved it. The pad see eww had American broccoli in it which i plucked out because I'm used to eating it with the Chinese broccoli. I also took out the bean sprouts. I like bean sprouts but don't feel that it belongs in the pad see ewe. In all my years eating Thai food I've never seen anyone out bean sprouts in it. The flavor was good. My boyfriend ordered 3 on the spicy scale and our complaint on the one is that the spice wasn't cooked into the food but sprinkled on top so it wasn't mixed in at all which means there is no even distribution of the heat. Other than that the food was good. I've had better but it's good. Customer service is on point and the restaraunt itself was nice."}
{"text":"This food is the best Thai ever and the price is great!!! Got three curries and egg rolls and it was under $40.  All come with rice.  Spice level is nice at 4 or 5. It's hot hot. The food is super fresh. One curry had fried tofu. Lots of it.  The other dishes had chicken and a ton of meat.  Service is super friendly. Will be my go to Thai place from now on !!! I want to order all the dishes to try !"}
{"text":"This place is very old , but the quality of the food remain the same , very tasty , and good on the price"}
{"text":"Next to Frys - Good Food At Fair Prices...  They start you off with a smile and a little cup of veggie soup.   I ordered the pad see ew with chicken at Thai spicy for the level of greatness! The food was probably 3.75 of 5 stars... No the freshest tasting but not bad...  The staff was very quiet but friendly. When I was leaving my waitress talked a bit to me about Thailand since I was speaking some Thai to her...  Thai soap operas are a funny Asian thing... I am not a TV while eating kind of guy, but Thai and Laotian people really live to have those soap operas going.... Lol...."}
{"text":"I clearly had NO idea that here inPhoenix I would find ANY Thai restaurants that are remotely authentic that might rival the best of those in LA or the Bay Area and most especially Thailand. Well, having lived most of y life in San Francisco AND lived in Bangkok for a while, I can say this is easily without doubt, as good as you can expect it to get for Thai in Phoenix.   Chanpen is the real deal, and while not the best Thai restaurant I have been to in my life, it is absolutely fantastic and offers the a genuine, authentic Thai experience for those who know their way around the block and know how to order authentic Thai.   Try the Kapow Gai and ask if they have Chinese broccoli ( hit and miss). It's great to add some veggies! And the Tom Yum is excellent and another MUST HAVE dish would be the Larb Gai, but be sure to ask they make it Thai style - with cabbage and NOT lettuce (YUK)! That's how the dish is intended to be eaten.   Nothing fancy here at all, and the place is small and unpretentious. But service is good and staff friendly. Come with friends and eat Thai style - family style and you won;t be dissapointed."}
{"text":"GREAT prices - just $7.95 lunch specials, many to choose from. They let me customize the spice level of the dish I ordered which was much appreciated.  They forgot to get me the beverage I ordered until I finally approached the counter and asked for it near the end of my meal, but I will still say that the service was very friendly. I'm guessing this was a rare mistake."}
{"text":"We tried this place today. The food was a 4 out of 5 star, but I will admit that we got the food to go because we got their approximately 20 minutes until closing and didn't want to be rushed.  We order the Thai Basil with Chicken, Green Papaya Salad, and Beef Chow Mien Thai Style. For service, even though we order to go, I'd have to give them 5 out of 5. They gave each member of our family a scoop of green tea ice cream while we waited for our food! Food was well packaged and came with everything we needed which was helpful since we were going back to our hotel to eat our dinner.   This place is a hidden gem that is kind of squeezed in between a residential neighborhood. Without Yelp, we probably would have never discovered this place. A big thanks to the all the Yelp users who came here before us."}
{"text":"Some of the best, most flavorful, Thai food in the valley. I ordered spiceness 2 (out of 5) and thought it was perfectly spicy for me, a mild-moderate spice eater. I had the panang curry with tofu which was good. My husband had the drunken noodles with beef which was also quite flavorful. This restaurant has moderately increased prices since opening but offers green tea ice cream with chocolate drizzle as a complementary dessert surprise. It was quite refreshing. The bench could use an upgrade as my guest and I played a game of tug-of-back. I lost. The staff really seems to enjoy themselves as loud bantering in another language dominated conversation throughout our meal."}
{"text":"It was delicious except I think I may have an milk intolerance with coconut milk. Had the avocado green curry.  Fast service at authentic Thai hole in the way restaurant. Was in the middle of nowhere ...could have been somewhere in Thailand."}
{"text":"There are frat dorm rooms that have more space and charm than this joint. But it still gets five stars because there's no Thai food in AZ that tastes this good.   This is what I want out of Thai food: delicious, and lots of it. And that is what Chanpen does.   Also, Chanpen sounds like an Asian trying to say \"Champion\". I am Asian so that qualifies me to make racially offensive statements."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for close to two years now from the original location and I am still amazed every time I come here. It got even better when they opened a new gorgeous restaurant just two minutes down the street. I've probaly tried close to everything on the menu and I still love every dish like it's the first time. Nothing here is bland, although I highly advise caution with the spice levels, they do not play around. The owners are always super friendly and kind. This place is amazing and has changed my who outlook on asian and thai cusine."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place for Thai food in Phoenix and opened on New Years Day. Well we found Chanpen, and it was definitely a hole in the wall type of place, but very authentic.  We called in to make sure it was open on the holiday and they were! We ordered 3 things and they were all delicious!  The chicken skewers, a little dry but love the peanut sauce!  Pad see ew was good, lots of seafood!  Fried rice was my favorite, well seasoned and great tasting.  They provided us with great service and great food, thank you!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. I've been having lunch and dinner here since the day they opened. Family owned and very friendly to their customers."}
{"text":"It was OK.  Had the pad thai.  Dined in. Tiny, dingy, needs updating.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a little earlier and it was magnifico!!! I normally get the Pad Thai level 3 spicy. Today I got their Pineapple Fried Rice no chicken with shrimp. It was sooooo great! Best Thai food in Phoenix! I love this place. You will not be disappointed if you eat here. It's a little hole in the wall but it is an amazing hole"}
{"text":"One of the better place for Thai in Phoenix.  Like to go to this place for lunch.  They are a bit slow on service at during lunch so we go to Thai Elephant on University when we need faster service."}
{"text":"I normally say I don't like Thai. I had the sweet and sour with tofu and it was so good though, I may have to rethink this frame of mind. Fast service, family owned, good prices."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place was amazing. Once again Yelp has shown me another amazing restaurant. I saw this was near my work and decided to give it a try since it got such great reviews.   I got drunken noodles with tofu and spring rolls. I got the number three level of spice which was perfect. The food was great, I mean orgasmically great!!! I've had plenty of Thai food but this is by far the best I've had in Phoenix. There is a great vegetarian option for almost all the dishes according to my very helpful and attentive waiter. Also they have an amazing lemongrass soup.   The actual place is super small and intimate. This is not a fine dining establishment. It's total \"hole in the wall\" which I find are the best restaurants.   Basically EAT HERE IF YOU WANT ONE OF THE BEST THAI MEALS IN PHOENIX! :)"}
{"text":"Dont let the outside of this small building fool you. The aroma as soon as you open the door will tell you that your in the right spot trust me. The service was great especially considering my wife and I first visit was on a Saturday. I ordered the thai egg rolls which were amazing I could have eating a dozen of them the outside layered crunch paired with a slightly soft interior and fresh vegetables was awesome. The shrimp spring rolls were really good as well and super fresh but I am a sucker for egg rolls done right so next time I will order more then I did as each order comes with 2 pieces. The pad thai was my entree which for me honestly ordering at a heat level of 3 was on the really sweet side however the hostess did offer to make it for me adding additional oyster sauce in order to settle the sweetness down. I declined and just asked for some on the side and she gladly provided me some just because of my own taste buds looking for that heat element with a little sweet. My wife had the combination rice which she loves heat so ordering the level 5, though I warned her she loved it. There thai tea was killer we ended up ordering 2 and also another to go because there truly addicting. Our meal was completed with a green tea ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce complementary plus a smile. Perfect way to end our lunch date and on to shopping not feeling heavy at all. I must say that we already plan to come back to this cute little spot again."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is no joke. I am pretty sure this is the best Thai food that I have ever eaten, my husband agrees. Don't be discouraged by the shady look of the building. When we drove up at night my husband said, \"I don't think this is it, I don't think you can eat here...\". We decided to give it a try anyways and we were not disappointed! It is a very small restaurant, but the workers were so nice and welcoming.   We tried the Panang curry and the chicken Pad Thai and both were heavenly. We tried their spring rolls and those were very good too, and reasonably priced. We got 3 spicy and that was about perfect, some good heat, but I wasn't dying. The curry was so smooth and had a good amount of meat and perfectly cooked vegetables. They didn't scrimp on rice either, which I hate. The Pad Thai was just amazing, spicy and peanuty, my mouth is watering as I write this. We ended with a small bowl of their green tea ice cream, which I normally don't love, but it was great!   Food = Amazing, Service = Friendly, Price = Very Reasonable. We were only in Phoenix for 3 days and I ate here twice, it's that good. I cannot wait to come back in the future!!"}
{"text":"A great find. Just looking for a casual bite before the movie and this place had great atmosphere, friendly service, excellent dishes. Pa-Nang Curry was wonderful. We ordered the level 3 spicy - maybe just a tad too hot for me but still manageable. If you a regular with spicy level 3 is probably just fine. I might have been better with 2."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The food was fresh and hot.  I got pad thai , crab puffs,  & Thai tea.  They were so delicious!  I'm definitely coming back and recommending this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"My family just loves this place.  We found it through yelp and it's exactly the kind of place we enjoy.  It's a family owned dump but so cute with a warm atmosphere.  The food is really good and fresh.  They always start with some delicious soup--spicy and tasty.  My daughters eat the noodles and I love their sweet and sour pork which are outrageously good.  This is an inexpensive, casual place but you won't be disappointed.  Our meal at lunch for 3 costs around $22."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Every time that I fly into phoenix, this Is my first stop!  Best food I've had in a while.  Exploding with flavors and spices.   Be warned, do not order above a 3 heat if you can't take it!!!"}
{"text":"OMG:  My favorite is the Penang Curry.  Love these little hole in the wall secret places. Fast service and fantastic food at great prices."}
{"text":"Service was fast and very polite.  The food was really good though a bit too spicy for me personally even at their lowest spice level (I'm pretty sensitive to spice though).  The coconut ice cream had little fruit chunks in it and was AMAZING and a definite must try!"}
{"text":"The food was terrific!  The staff were friendly and efficient.  Only problem was a foreign article in my wife's lunch.  On a positive note, they apologized profusely and immediately took the price of her meal off the bill.  Hey, nobody's perfect.    We'll try again."}
{"text":"Have been here two times and both times the food was great but the service was poor. Had to wait 30 mins to get served. I came with 3 other people and we were not served together either."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Don't let the small hole in the wall location deceive you. This place is 100% authentic, great food, and excellent service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Chanpen. Yes it's a tiny hole in the wall restaurant, yes it unfortunately closes early at 8pm, and yes the parking lot is rather difficult to navigate during peak hours, but I'd gladly brave all of that for their amazing quality of food.   Service is always welcoming and courteous. It really drives the feeling of coziness to a new degree, especially as the restaurant seems to be converted from a house. There are fewer than ten tables inside, but everything is kept clean and organized even when there's a line out the door and endless phone orders for takeout.  Chicken larb: I've had so many versions of this dish, but I'm always looking for that fragrant lemongrass kick. Chanpen's rendition is delicious, with potent lemongrass, tartness from the lime, and crisp vegetables. The portion is generous, and though it's listed as a salad, I rather think there's more protein than anything else (which I love). The ground chicken is wok-tossed nicely so that it's not dry but still has that smoky hint of wok-fire. When I'm in the mood for a lighter dish, this larb would definitely be my go-to. I have to remember to ask if they have a beef version next time since I think that it might become my favorite dish here.  Chicken and shrimp pad thai:  Though standard offerings at a Thai restaurant, this is hands down the best I've found in Arizona thus far. The noodles are chewy and cooked perfectly so that they're not mushy, the proteins are permeated with flavor without being dry, and the sauciness is perfect. I like my pad thais on the saucier side, and Chanpen's version does not disappoint. The sauce is a great balance of sweet, savory, and vinegary. A lot of Thai restaurant go heavy-handed with the sweetness with not enough tartness to balance it out, so the dishes get sticky and heavy really fast. Chanpen's does not, and I enjoyed the flavor so much that I polished off the entire generous portion and felt stuffed for the rest of the day (worth it).  Royal yellow curry: Wow the curry here is phenomenal. I'm not exactly sure what makes it so good, but the flavor makes it hard to stop eating. It's creamy, flavorful, and just the right balance of rich and not heavy. Each curry dish comes with a side of steamed rice, which I appreciate since many restaurants require a separate order of rice on the side.   Crab fried rice: This dish is on the specials board, so I'm not sure if it's always offered. The crab is understandably canned, but the fried rice itself is a testament to great skill with a wok. There are crunchy onions, fresh green onions, and nicely slivered eggs to culminate in a really satisfying plate of fried rice. I had almost half the portion left over, and it tasted just as good -- if not better -- the next day.  To polish off every meal, there is a scoop of complimentary ice cream with the bill. It's a little thing, but a kind gesture I really appreciate. I can't foresee a time when I won't want to come back to Chanpen, and I can't wait to update this review with more tasty dishes in the future."}
{"text":"My last Thai food review - a couple weeks ago - was 2 stars.  It is with GREAT pleasure that I had some really delicious Thai food last night.   I was driving by, saw a \"strip mall\" on the corner, and their lit sign caught my  eye. Lucky break.   I love Thai food, and I've had Thai food in Thailand, Vietnam and the States: I've known the good, the bad and the ugly. Weirdly, the favorite Thai food I'd had was in a small town in North Vietnam.  Last night I think it was beaten! And I wasn't even planning to grab dinner- whew.   I always ask a good waiter their suggestions for the best dishes that night. I had a fantastic waiter who- when he saw I was a \"foodie\"- was beyond helpful in suggesting dishes I would love.   He specifically said, \"get the eggplant, it's so delicious...\". I couldn't quite picture that, but he convinced me. I also ordered a curry- a real test of the food-and asked for shrimp. He said , \" get chicken for the curry, and the shrimp for the eggplant-trust me\". He also suggested a different curry, saying it was HIS favorite. Okay then.   When it came, I immediately saw what the eggplant dish was about; chocked full of thick delicious mushrooms and other perfectly cooked veggies. The shrimp were larger than any I've seen in Thai dishes.    The curry had a thick, delicious sauce, and the chicken was tender and not a single piece of fat! That's rare.  The flavor of the sauces was beyond description. I think it was the best curry I've ever had: p-nutty and spiced just right. The sauce in the eggplant was unusual, thinner and absolutely stunning!    They even had sticky rice and mango for desert! Oh joy. I had to try it- not many have it. I sure enjoyed it, stuffed or not.   I have enough leftovers for two more meals, and I'm sure happy about that.   See the pictures- and GO to this great little gem."}
{"text":"Legit Thai at very reasonable prices. Love this place! Don't be put off by the neighborhood... it is solid, quality cuisine!"}
{"text":"While Chanpen appears and feels like a hole-in-the-wall dive restaurant, the prices would reflect otherwise. Be prepared to front $10/dish with substantially expensive complimentary appetizers, drinks, and desserts. Cost aside, the food is spectacular. It reminds me of the great Thai restaurants back home in LA."}
{"text":"Ths is a fine place for Thai food. They were suggested by our Timeshare, shame on me for not checking with Yelp. They are in a strip mall at 48 St. and Baseline.    Our server was a very pleasant fellow named Mod. His knowledge and helpfulness was impressive.    The pineapple fried rice was a clear winner. It was hot and tasty with 3.5-star heat, and big shrimp and plenty of big fresh pineapple chinks, plus lots of tasty chicken.     I was ready to add soy sauce but nothing was really needed. The stir fried snow peas with beef was a mild and tasty treat.There were lots of onions, thin slices of beef, and carrots.    They served up tea flavored ice cream gratis and it was delicious. They were out of coconut ice cream a house favorite. I want to sample their Panang curry on our next visit."}
{"text":"Food was great, my son loves the cucumber water they served. Basil chicken was too die for, the atmosphere was great. They give you complimentary coconut ice cream which is great  after the all the spices of their food. Thai tea was also delicious. Anyone wanting Thai food this is a good place"}
{"text":"Superb. Very flavorful.  Nice helpings and friendly staff.  Very tiny place so you may have to wait for a seat.  Royal Curry, Thai ice tea, crab puffs, green tea ice cream - - all wonderful"}
{"text":"When you first drive up, you question if it's an actual restaurant. But once you get past the small size and kind of run down exterior, you get inside and glorious senses start to fill your nostrils. They food is made fresh and made to order. Food is full of flavor and their Thai tea is amazing. This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants. Great customer service and polite staff. I am a repeat customer and recommend everyone experience this place."}
{"text":"Ventured out here on my last night in town. Don't be turned off by the location, as you are guaranteed some of the best Thai food you'll ever have. Parking is fairly limited and there's only about 6 or 7 tables inside. I ordered the Pad Thai and my dad had the beef Chow Mein, both of which were excellent. My dad enjoyed the Chow Mein. The Pad Thai that I had (at a heat level of 3 out 5) was perfectly seasoned, with a fairly generous portion of food overall, although it wasn't nearly as much shrimp as I thought there would be. They have a great variety of hot chilies on the table if you'd like to up the heat mid meal. At the end we were offered what I thought was pistachio ice cream, which was great as well."}
{"text":"Seriously, I can't give this place enough stars. I always get the Massaman Chicken Curry and it is amazing. I originally fell in love with that dish at another restaurant and have ordered it numerous places. After having it at Chanpen I no longer go anywhere else. I tried once, and it just didn't compare!!   A huge plus also is the Staff. Extremely friendly, and just hold people. I reccomend anyone who has driving by there and wondered what it was like to just go park and put in an order. I drove by 100 times before I ate there, and now know I was missing out for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is in a little hole in the wall building, but it's a gem!  I ordered the Panang Curry. Thai food is my favorite food and order Panang curry wherever I go. This is probably the best tasting I've ever had! The sauce was very flavorful and there was lots of  chicken and some carrots. I only wish there were more veggies. The service is quick price is right at $10. They have a cheaper lunch menu where you can get smaller portions. I have eaten here twice with visiting Phoenix and it was amazing both times."}
{"text":"And passed by this restaurant more than 100 times and the truth not well I called attention today 4/15/2018 decided to visit him for the first time and what was my surprise that left me thrilled with the food and the service. excellent flavor. very small place but nice. the hesitation of the place is the same chef and one of the waitresses his daughter. all excellent. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem - best Thai food - large portions and very friendly staff - will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Learn from us! They close at 8pm, not 9:30pm. But the food and service was amazing, and they kept the shop open and didn't rush us when we were totally oblivious to the fact that they had closed already. The wait staff is very attentive and sweet, and the price point is great. They gave us free green tea ice cream too! Thank you Chanpen!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. We stopped in here one day when we had a craving for something different. When we walked in the restaurant was empty and the host was near the kitchen chatting with the cook, but he came as soon as he spotted us and told us to take any table in the place. We commented on the emptiness and he said it would start to fill up soon, which it did. The food was outstanding- flavorful and exactly what we ordered. I had the stir fried noodles and veggies with a level 1 of spice. Really, there was no spice at all but that's what I wanted. The waiter said a few times to let him know if the dish was too sweet. Hubs had curry at I think a 4/5 spice level. It tasted plenty hot to me but he said it could have used more spice. He also ordered a pumpkin curry to go and he said it tasted pretty much like the other curry, so the pumpkin flavor was a bit light. The green tea ice cream was amazing at the end of the meal- very lightly flavored. Oh, and when I mentioned that I am allergic to pistachios (after seeing them on the menu) the waiter said that was fine, and that they could also accommodate a peanut or general tree nut allergy. While I'm not sure how a Thai restaurant could logistically accommodate a severe peanut allergy, all was good on my end as far as the pistachios went."}
{"text":"Yep. It's as good as they say. Super small though. Literally only 5 tables. Awesome food and great service."}
{"text":"This was my discovery way back home when i was living in Tempe as i was passing by this place but to my astonishment when i started living in Deer valley i now travel to eat Thai food to only this place as i get to have a good drive and awesome food too. Food is simply amazing ,well prepared ,rightly spiced and meet correctly cooked . Love the Starter combo platter ,Pad thai and they have a variety of curries like the Avacado curry and mango curry ,its so yummy you have to taste it to believe it. Thai ice tea is perfect and dont be shocked if ur served an ice cream its complimentary though..."}
{"text":"I will give this 2 but then being niceOK 3 MAX. Ordered soup super salty.  And chicken was rubbery"}
{"text":"What a little gem. I found this place in search for good Thai food in the phoenix area and I wasn't having much luck. I came across this place and ordered the pad Thai for lunch one day. It was flavorful and didn't have too much of that fishy taste that other pad thai's often have. I can only speak for lunch but their portions are huge, to go boxes are packed full and I usually get 2-3 meals out of it. Just about ever dish offered can be made vegetarian which I love! The only downfall is the tofu- it has more of a spongy texture than I like."}
{"text":"We tried to order takeout from here and the person on the phone got frustrated that I couldn't understand him the first time and once we finally got everything cleared up, he hung up the phone before confirming that we were done. So we called back and canceled the order. So I can't say anything about the quality of food, just the poor quality of service."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall worth visiting.  Nice laid back atmosphere.  Service was fast and friendly.   They give you mason jars of water and coconut ice cream to finish.  l like spicy food and often times when you say medium it's pretty mild and you have to specifically ask for Thai spicy just to get some heat.  I ordered medium and it was spicy enough to make me glad I didn't make the \"Thai spicy\" assumption here.  Had a couple of curry dishes and they were quite flavorful.     I noticed their blackboard after ordering, which was a bit of a bummer, as they had avocado curry.  Never had that before but it gives me a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Never tried Thai food before so maybe I just didn't know what to expect, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about the location but based on the reviews, decided to give it a try. Wow, were we impressed! I love true hole in the walls! Its hard to find those here in the valley. We ordered the Panang Curry and loved every bite. The portions are more than generous as well! Definitely our go to Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the area. Great helpful staff and the food is always delicious"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! This place doesn't look like much but the food is amazing!! I will tell everyone I know to try this place out! The owners are super nice and give great service as well!"}
{"text":"Scrumptious Food, Beautiful, bigger, new location not far from the original one. Had thai tea with cream , pad thai, drunken noodles, and hubby had curry I believe the yellow one, and a side of peanut sauce. I would eat there weekly if it wasn't so far from me. Service  was Wonderful even gave my children and I am complimentary coconut ice-cream.  All food was delish, the chicken tasted freshly cooked not pre boiled like other places I've tried. I'd love to try their lunch menu! :d"}
{"text":"We found this little beauty of a restaurant a few months ago we live 43 miles away and would make the trip to eat here over any other place! All the food has been exceptional & we love love love the Chef she's amazing. They all are wonderful and very polite."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here last night.  We were incredibly surprised by how wonderful this place is and will for sure be our go to place for Thai food.  Meal:  Won ton soup, fried rice with chicken (little spiciness), fresh rolls, and red curry with tofu (extreme spiciness).  We also ordered two Thai ice teas.  Taste:  Each appetizer and entree was the best version of that dish out of every Thai restaurant my fiance and I have been to in Phoenix.  It was very evident the food was fresh.  The requested \"spicy level\" was dead on.  I have noticed that screwing up the \"spicy level\" is the easiest way to detract people from eating Thai food.  10 out of 10.  Value: The dish was prices were fair and reasonable.  The prices were commensurate with the portion sizes.  There was nothing jaw dropping about the value of the meal, but hey, quality always takes precedence over quantity, right?  3 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The waitress, who claimed to be the owner's daughter, was extremely friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and punctual.  She was attentive.  The service was just as good, if not better, than the food.  In terms of cleanliness, nothing indicated that it wasn't clean.  10 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The place itself is very tiny.  There is maybe 5 or 6 tables in the entire joint.  Very little art work.  This place is for eating good Thai food and nothing more.  It is not in the best of neighborhoods, but that it is what it is.  3 out of 5.  Overall:  This place isn't for a date night.  Its not a place to celebrate a major accomplishment at work or school.  It is for eating excellent Thai food with a no thrills, relaxed atmosphere.  Because of the concise, but still excellent, menu, this is a great place for people new to Thai food to stick their big toe in the water, per se.  26 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the weekend and i found this place on yelp, without it i would never have stopped here but i have to say the food wasn't half bad. The seafood soup with shrimp fried rice was great. And the complementary ice cream was good and nice of them."}
{"text":"The place was easy to location.  It was clean and nice.  The staff was super friendly.  The food was just ok.  The Thai ice tea kick butts, so good.    The satay chicken was not grilled it more fried in the deep fryer.  The peanut sauce did not have the super savor flavor.  The wonton soup was too salty for me."}
{"text":"Price is steep. Vegetable dish, very small portion. Basil Fish, flavor is very good, but fish is mushy and extremely salty."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dive and only has 8 tables, but the food is PHENOMENAL!   I think the Panang Curry is the best.  It is family owned and I have never had a dish that wasn't amazing.  You can choose how hot you want it from 1 to 5, and 5 really means 5.  They don't fool around."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could. Best Thai in the valley.  I love the pad thai!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, check.  Decent service, check.  Very good food, definitely! The flavors were unique and very good.  Would give 5 stars but the atmosphere is just a little too off putting to deserve 5. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I work by this place and my coworkers and I decided to give it a try. Ever since than, this place is my favorite place to go for thai food. I would always order the Rad Nar which is the big flat noodles mixed in with your choice of meat. Pretty good. I also even had some friends try this place. We tried the seafood combo hot pot, drunken noodles, yellow curry, broccoli beef, noodle soup and their mango w/sticky rice.   EVERYTHING was amazingly delicious. We even got complimentary desert. They gave us fried banana with green tea ice cream and topped it off with a chocolate drizzle. That alone just made my meal that much better, The staff is great. They are laid back and their customer service is above average.   So, this place is the best place for thai food in Arizona. Been there so many times and it has never been disappointing. Strongly suggest giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Great drunken noodles with beef.  Dinner came with coconut ice cream which was yummy too!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. My first time there but treated like I'm a regular. I ordered Pad See Ew with chicken to go. As I waited, they gave me a bottle of water and a scoop of ice cream. I forgot to order a side of rice which was also free. I got my food and went back to the hotel. I ate the pad see we, great flavor. I will go back when in area again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and this place is gang busters. I recommend tom ka soup (w/chicken & white rice), stir-fried garlic sauce (w/chicken), spicy sweet basil (w/beef), and the spicy basil noodles. I like that their spicy levels are consistent across time (if you request a 4-spicy level, you won't end up with a 2-spicy level instead) which has always been a problem at other Thai restaurants. Additionally, the staff is REALLY, REALLY nice. The first time i ate here they spontaneously brought out their coconut ice cream for us to try on the house. I always decline dessert since I don't have a sweet tooth, but this was particularly yummy and the perfect ending to a spicy meal. This has been my go-to Thai spot ever since."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and I love thai food. The service was good but this place has fairly mediocre thai food. The pad thai was bland and the soup was over salted.  Also no jasmine tea on the menu. But they do have free ice cream :-)"}
{"text":"Food is great. We like to try out the curries and it doesn't disappoint. Their Thai hot is actually pretty spicy so good for it if you like it that way."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix. Don't let the location or building scare you away. Service was excellent. Papaya salad was amazing."}
{"text":"Wanted some authentic Thai cuisine and had heard a lot of good things about Chanpen Thai Cuisine. Ordered the Thai Tea, Yellow Curry, Pad Thai, and Drunken Noodles. All were delicious. The Drunken Noodles were the only spicy dish I ordered and it had great flavor and texture. The Pad Thai also tasted great and the noodles were cooked wonderfully. The Yellow Curry had a great consistency and flavor, something that I would liken to making a great coconut curry without using too much coconut milk.  The Thai Tea was excellent and given the price was a good serving size (unlike other places I have been to where I literally have paid $3.00 for a cup of ice).  Would definitely come back for Thai food, only issue is it's so far away from where I live haha."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, very unassuming from the outside but man the food is great and the service was so hospitable."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. My issue is with the service. It takes nearly half an hour to receive your food and the staff is not very attentive or friendly. Great food, crappy service makes this place a 3 in my book."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food! Seriously the best Thai in AZ! Both locations are great, for a hole in the wall experience, go to the one on broadway for a more upscale experience come to baseline."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a couple of college friends, and was great. Hole in the wall restaurant in the corner of 24th Street that you wouldn't think was a place to receive good food, but you'll be surprise. This restaurant packs a punch, with the diverse of amount of Thai cuisine you'll get. Food was delicious, and service was great. I myself got the panang curry with the right about of spice packed with flavors. Also in the end we were treated with a complimentary green tea ice cream that went well after the meal. Will definitely come back again if in the area and might be one of the best Thai places I ever tried. A spot to come for good eats for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever tasted. The green curry is my favorite dish although it burns hotter than Drogon from game of thrones. Over all it's a good place you should try! Like now."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Not a lot of seating but don't let that hold you back from waiting or getting some carry out."}
{"text":"I think this is the best hole in the wall in town. I love to take people here, the appearance can be startling for some but the food always wins them over. I am obsessed with the pineapple curry, the garlic chicken and pad Thai."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!! Stopped by on way home from work today. Ordered the chicken spicy sweet basil. Yum !!! I have class this place for the past 9 years and never went in because of the small building  when I saw the Yelp reviews I decided to try it .will go again and  again amd again now.  wow I have been missing out!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai place in Phoenix. Don't let the exterior scare you away because the taste is worth it!! There is limited seating so prepare for that or order for takeout."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. The restaurant is new so the inside is pretty modern and bigger than the original one. Service was nice, but it kinda felt rushed. Once we got the food they handed us the check immediately and didn't really bother to come check up or refill drinks.   Other than the the food was decent. I always order the lemongrass soup with seafood with a level 3 spice. The flavorful is great if you like lemongrass. It is served on a hot pot type thing which keeps your soup hot!:) It is enough to feed at least 3 people. The seafood portion for the soup is plenty. It comes with mussels, squid, fish and a couple of shrimp. I suggest getting this is you're a soup person.   The other dish I got was the orange chicken. It's not normally on the menu but it was presented on the specials board. It was served on top of greens and sliced oranges. Portion size was pretty decent. The chicken was nice and crispy. Great flavoring not too sweet and not too crazy with the orange flavoring. Only downside is that it was caked in batter."}
{"text":"Loved loved everything here from the beef salad to the pa nang curry (amazing and 10 stars if I could!) to their fresh and yummy green tea! Customer service was top notch and attentive. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This place has very amazing authentic Thai food. I ordered the thai toast apatizer and red curry pork. The service was quick and the food very good. Do not get too hung up on yhe cramp space of you are looking for authentic Thai food. Very food north eastern Thai music (Isan) as well. They do a lot of to-go business also. Highly recommended if you are near this part of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The rice... BOMB! Have to get it!!! Well lit! Great service! Next time... Definitely getting sticky rice with mango! Loved the large water jars!"}
{"text":"I was excited to read about a Thai restaurant on the West side as I've only ventured to a few places for Thai, all located in Central Phoenix.    The decor is hilarious; ridiculous red booths and lots of mirrors.  The two people that i saw working were cleaning every crevice of the furniture, so rest assured that it is clean.  I ordered the basil garlic chicken (err, don't remember the name of it) and my friend had the chicken pad thai.  We both were quite happy with our meals.  The meal came with four different sauces that you could add if you needed a little more umph.  Everything was good, but not amazing.  We were both happy to have left-overs for later, as the portion size was solid.  The bill came and it seemed cheap to me, it was 8.50 a piece.  The server was not exactly friendly, and chose not to talk to us, but rather would just come and stand and wait for us to tell her what we might need.  The couple con's totally outweigh the pro's.  Hooray for decent Thai on the West side!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. We had the seafood hot pot and the seafood fried rice. Both were excellent.   They do spices right, unlike other Thai places. So, spicy level 4 or 5 is actually pretty spicy. I think spicy level 3 is close to a level 5 at most other places. They gave us free ice cream at the end to cool it all off!  The ambiance is bit hole-in-the-wall but it's very much like eateries in Thai land -- so I love it."}
{"text":"The Mango special with shrimp was very tasty. Large portions and fresh. Service was very good and food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"This is a great little Thai specializing in authentic Thai food. We love the seafood Tom Kha, Thai Fish cakes and pineapple rice. The curry dishes are great along with the customer favorite Pad Thai. The service is friendly and warm."}
{"text":"I go here once a month and they remember my drinks and food orders, the food is cheap but fantastic. One of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at. Be early at lunch time, seating is limited and the place is popular"}
{"text":"The best I've ever had! Everything was really good and customer service was great. Even had ice cream at the end. Its hard to win me over, but you can tell everything was made fresh"}
{"text":"A restaurant with 4.5 stars is always worth checking out. This one really held up to its reputation. Awsome food, great service !"}
{"text":"Ever since Palee's Crown has closed, I have been trying to find a replacement. I finally found it!  This place is very easy to miss, but you will be sorry you did!   Food - Amazing. Some of the best Thai food I have ever had in the valley  Price - Very fair for the food you get  Atmosphere - This place isn't that great to look at, but you aren't here to enjoy the art.  You will wait a bit for the food. I have only ordered out, but you can wait 20-25 minutes for your food. It is worth it, BUT, don't expect a quick lunch if you work around here unless you call in early"}
{"text":"You are in for a treat if you eat at this restaurant.  We hit this place for lunch and were not disappointed. Had the red curry chicken and my coworker tried the fried rice.  Both meal portions were decent and the flavour was great.  Wait staff was friendly and the service was prompt."}
{"text":"Excellent food from a hole in the wall restaurant. Great friendly service. We ordered shrimp Panang curry and chicken Pad Thai . They served us complimentary desert sweet rice with green tea ice cream . What a way to end great Vacation ."}
{"text":"Good Thai food and the ice cream made by the chef as a free after food dessert is amazing. Love to eat here every once in awhile."}
{"text":"I went ot this place today on my lunch break from work and man o man! This food is REALLY good! I got the yellow beef curry and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food in town and always good service. Lot of business folks go there for lunch so it may get busy lunch hours."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service. Delicious Food ! Curry is my favorite dish here as well as the seafood soups"}
{"text":"After all these years, this is still my favorite local Thai restaurant.   My favorite dishes are the Panang Curry,  the Coconut curry soup level 4 which is loaded with veggies and tofu, and the lastly but certainly not least the drunken noodles.  Everything WE have had here is nothing short of fantastic! I get excited at the thought of coming here, and think of all the options I have to look forward to.  Never disappointed.  I had a long day at work today and decided to stop in and get take out on my way home.  They gave me a bottle of cold water, and a fantastic bowl of coconut ice cream on the house, while I waited for my order.  Love Chan Pen!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pad Thai at a reasonable price.  Friendly service, love it!"}
{"text":"Place is a little small but food is delicious! A 4 on the spiciness scale is really really spicy so don't do it unless you absolutely love spicy food! Overall, it hit the Thai food crave we were having. Plus they gave us free green tea ice cream at the end :)"}
{"text":"This place has cute decor & extremely delicious & flavorful food. We are regulars here. Our favorite dishes are Penang Curry, Yellow Curry Chicken, Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice & Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Few things besides the food that impressed me, was during lunch time they give you free soup & for dinner free pineapple coconut or green tea ice-cream. That's hard to beat :) Also we are picky eaters, they only use white chicken in all their Curries & when you leave you feel comfortably full. Their food is not greasy at all, in fact I feel it's healthier than eating at other places. The owner Mod is a very genuine guy.  He'll come greet you at the table, make you whatever you want however you want. It feels like it's your home & your own kitchen.  Highly recommend you to try this place, you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"Love this little hole in the wall Thai spot. Restaurant is tiny but there's enough parking and always a movie on inside for the kids to stare at while the grownups talk. Flavor is good and service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is as good as it get folks! I had the drunken noodles with chicken and beef. Let me tell you I was grunting like a pig. WIth no shame. IT WAS THAT GOOD. Reasonably priced and such a small shack. A hidden jewel. So happy I found you Chanpen, we shall meet again soon! Really soon!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  When you drive by this little, and I mean little, place on Broadway, if you blink you will miss it.  But turn around and prepare to enjoy some of the best Thai Food you will ever have!  The Panang Red Curry with Shrimp was so fabulous, it made my eyeballs sweat!  The Vegetable Egg Rolls were equally amazing,  The dining room is incredibly small due to the size of the building, but every table was full of happy guests.  There was a line waiting to sit, and another line out the door for pick up orders.  If you're in the area, stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"Yum! Got lunch special - drunken noodles, spice level 2, with thai tea. Everything delicious, with leftovers for later! I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"As a pregnant woman I have very specific cravings and this place hit every single one! It was our first time here and the service, food and ambiance was all well worth five stars! We are from Tucson and will make the trip up here every time I want Thai food now!"}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving and the food is amazing and fairly priced! Sweet Thai basil is amazing, spicy friend rice and their Pad Thai are super good too. I'm not a huge fan of their curry (shown) but it's still great!"}
{"text":"Found this lunch spot near my job, reviews are 100% true. Very delicious and A++ customer service!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the area a couple months ago and we wanted Thai food. We've driven by this place but never went in because it looks pretty sketch from the outside. But the food?! I got the drunken noodles with tofu with mild spice and it was freaking amazing!! I seriously wanted to order another one but I had to control myself. Had thai tea too and it was good, not very sweet.  Those noodles are amazing and I still drool thinking about it every once in a while."}
{"text":"Great Food. And the ice cream at the end was a added delight. Good atmosphere. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Yum!  Thai food near my house!  It's a tad pricey but I guess I'm saving gas money. They have great lunch specials and I have been a frequent customer since my friend introduced me to this place."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Panang Curry was amazing! The locals we were visiting thanked us for pointing it out and said it will be their new go-to place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch yesterday and can't say it was the best thai food experience ive had. It was super slow and took about 45 mins to get my food. All i ordered was a lunch entre, the Thai fried rice i mean it tasted good but service was bad due to how long it took. On top of that, it seems like the air conditioning was broken because it was really hot in there. Not sure how a restaurant operates like this considering how hot it is here in AZ. I don't think the food was worth the wait nor dealing with the temperature."}
{"text":"A great hole-in-the-wall find. A friend had been here years ago and we were looking for a change of pace. The food was delicious and definitely spicy! I personally ordered the red curry with chicken spice level 2. It had just enough kick and was nice and smooth. I also tried a bite of level 2 sweet and aour pork and i thibk it was my favorite. No kick really, but very flavorful. I also tried a bit of level 3 pad Thai without peanuts and whooooaaaaa my mouth was on fire for a good 10 minutes. Luckily I had the Thai iced tea which was a nice sweet to the spice and definitely helped cool , I'd say try to go in an hour before close."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews anymore, but Chanpen Thai was so inspiring I just had to contribute!  South Phoenicians and Tempe residents rejoice, because this is seriously the best Thai food I've had in quite some time, possibly ever!  Anyone who knows anything about food understands that its the little hole-in-the-wall shops that are the best and this place is no different.  I'm honestly a little worried about when the word gets out because its such a small location, they will easily be packed.    We ordered some of our favorite standards: fresh veggie rolls with tofu, veggie pad thai and veggie panang curry.  Everything was seriously amazing.  Even the heat was just right...we ordered everything at a 3 on a 0-5 scale and it was perfect.  The curry flavor and creaminess plus the veggie selection and giant tofu chunks was the best panang I've ever had.  The pad thai was exceptional, again with the giant tofu chunks.  Serving sizes were great.  I was hoping to try dessert, but the food was so phenomenal I couldn't stop eating it!    They have a pretty extensive menu, and it sounds like they are pretty much willing to make anything the way you want it.  They asked us if we wanted to add tofu to the fresh rolls even though it wasn't on the menu, and made sure egg was ok in the pad thai.  Their lunch specials also look good for $6.    We were also told that on Friday and Saturdays they will be offering DELIVERY!  We are in trouble."}
{"text":"This Chanpen location serves the same quality food as the hole in the wall \"original\" but in a much nicer, more upscale setting, plus they have a liquor license.    3 of us (plus one baby) had dinner there last week and all went home happy.  Even the baby was happy ;)    We started with an order of crab wonton which was delicious.    And then I \"chickened out\" and ordered the sweet & sour chicken.   I was really pleased with it.   Far too many times, I have ordered this dish from other restaurants only to find that the sauce drowning the chicken is store bought and entirely too sweet.    Clearly, Chanpen's sweet and sour sauce is housemade and that makes all the difference in how this dish tastes, on top of the fact that the chicken itself was perfectly cooked.   Both of the ladies in our group were more adventurous and ordered curry dishes (one in a level 2 heat and the other in a level 3) and coconut soup, and both reported they were very pleased.  I tried all of the above and it was all quite tasty.   After dinner, they brought us all a small portion of green tea ice cream.  Let me tell you, the baby loved that.  After being a little fussy during dinner, that kid piped down and loved every bit of that ice cream!     Service was great - attentive and friendly.   Great dinner spot!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Arizona. Our family was driving through and wanted an Asian restaurant that wasn't too far off the freeway.   We all agreed this was the best mini detour we've ever taken.  The place is very small and looks a bit dirty, but don't let that fool you. The food is excellent!   We ordered the chicken satay appetizer, the red curry with pork, the chicken and shrimp pad Thai, and the stir fried beef with garlic sauce. Everything was delicious. The food looks so colorful and bright. The pad Thai and curry were my favorites in particular. The noodles were moist and not rubbery at all with lots of flavor. The curry was simple but flavorful.   They give out complimentary dessert at the end. I heard it's normally ice cream, but this time it was the fried banana. My mom was especially happy about this since she was asking us if we could order some at the end. Maybe they heard us. Or maybe they just guessed. Either way, great move.   The service was quick. The waitress was courteous and prompt, and the food came out pretty quickly.   I will definitely try to find this place again when we're coming through the city. This restaurant is a must-go!"}
{"text":"I have had troubles finding a Thai place in my area who's Pad Thai I really enjoy but after coming here, I can say I was more than pleased! I usually order takeout but the service is always fast. By the time I get my food home to eat (which is about a 10min drive), the food is still as fresh as if I were dining in. They even remembered details about my order by the sound of my voice from the few times I've called. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here.  The food and service are good.  They have great peanut salad dressing for lunch.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food in the south Phoenix area. Been to the Original (moms) location a  few miles north, food was so good the tiny place was always packed. Same quality, larger more contemporary look. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was stuck in Phoenix for a couple weeks and was starting to get desperate for some Asian food.  Chanpen proved to be the perfect location to satisfy my cravings.  Portions were huge and the service was great.  I had the pineapple fried rice, which was excellent.  The mango sticky rice was also pretty good despite the staff warning me that the mango wasn't in season and therefore not as sweet as it should be.    This is a mom and pop style store that I would've never seen if it hadn't been for Yelp.  This is the exact type of place I like to come to, especially when I'm sick of chain restaurants.  Would highly recommend stopping by here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very authentically done Flavorful, fresh, great portions even for lunch. Order Chicken Larb yes Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai  Whole in the wall...check it out"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Thai place in Arizona so far. I'm just going to get right to it... the quality is comparable to the Thai places I've tried in Thai town, West Hollywood in LA and the food itself in Thailand! I'm obsessed. Chanpen can take all my money and I won't mind.  Parking: very limited. Tiny lot with about 10-15 spots. I haven't had trouble finding parking just yet, but just keep this in mind if you want to come by during lunch rush hour.   Ambience: if you are looking for a spot for date night with beautiful decor and a hip vibe. You're reading the wrong yelp review. This place is all about the business: bomb dot com FOOD. There's nothing fancy, seating is very limited, but baby, their food will win your heart.  FOOD REVIEW: (I've only had their lunch specials so far, great deals btw)  PAD THAI: the noodles was the perfect consistency. The flavor was on point. There was plenty meat and a massive shrimp. MY FAVE! RED CURRY: It was a pretty small portion, but it was so delicious I couldn't get enough.  DRUNKEN NOODLES: The noodles were a little to broken up for my liking, BUT the flavor was out of this world. Just the right amount of kick with pepper and onion and a sprinkle of heaven. SPICY SWEET BASIL: okay... I thought it paired well with the rice but it seems like something I can make at home. My friends loved it though.  Spice level: their spice level is legit, none of that toned-down for the \"general population\" weak sauce. I was so tired of ordering \"spicy\" here in AZ and nothing ever come out spicy... Chanpen will please all you spice-thirsty beasts out there. A good burn was definitely something i've been missing since Thailand.  CHANPEN, don't go anywhere... I will be back real soon!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriends absolute favorite restaurant! I'm not going to lie my favorite is the complimentary green tea ice cream haha. Worth the try"}
{"text":"WOW! I'm so glad that the laboratory recommended this place. I couldn't decide, everything looked so delicious and as well priced- so, I got two lunch specials. Chicken fried rice and yellow curry chicken! Soooo amazing. Lunch special comes with wontons, a spring roll and lunch portion entrée. Very responsible portions. If you're in Phoenix, this is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Told to sit wherever. No backs on most tables with single cushion. Dirty table, food on floors. Bathroom missing ceiling tile. Good ok my dish was brought out before wife's meal Not Cool. Make it a take out only"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Thai food I have ever had here in Phoenix. Great service and everyone is so kind. Anytime I have anyone come visit me this is the place I always take them to."}
{"text":"Ok, calling it. After our year residency, Chanpen has been the-hands down- best thai food spot we've had in AZ and will be one of the go to eateries in general. Great service, topped with delicious food and was decently priced... man, you got us. Apparently we'd been waiting some time for our food as they apologized and offered us veggie spring rolls which despite the lack of meat was just yumms-and that's coming from an avid meat eater. We didn't really notice the wait as we were jamming out to the eccelctic music selection ranging from Kpop, to Thai pop, to early 2000 slow jams. We'd eaten here before but this was the first time we devoured everything in one sitting. We ordered the chicken larb, pad Thai, and spicy basil fried rice.  everything was deloycious, perfectly portioned, and just hit all the right spots. They topped us off with a green tea ice cream (last time they had coconut) which was just the perfect end. Will come back, will recommend to anyone who's hungry. Chanpen...you got us. We got gotten.  Wanted to note, it's rare to find a thai place that isn't afraid to give you the spice level you ask for, almost anywhere. Not watered down, but real spice. Accidentally asked for a 10 once and they did not play (didn't realize their scale was 0-5). It was still so good but definitely a mistake. Stuck to their scale this time and everything was perfection."}
{"text":"I went to the Baseline Rd branch more than twenty times. They have the great Thai cuisine food. Its very affordable. In ten Dollars you can buy a big bowl of soap for three persons or at least two persons. The service is comparatively faster than other international cuisine restaurants. The lighting and sitting area is good. The people working there are very friendly. However, I would like to recommend one thing ,that their food might be spicy for Americans. So better tell them before placing an order that food should be not spicy or lime. However, they also serve complimentary ice cream for free at the end of the delicious meal. Last time they served me Coconut ice cream. I swear it was really great. I never tasted such a good ice cream before."}
{"text":"The worst place you can get your food from. We waited for 45 mins for a pick up order, before we were asked to leave without food by the waiter. He literally asked me to leave without food because I asked him to give my food in next 5 mins. Didn't even apologize for the delay.   I am pregnant and there was no place to even sit and wait for that long, and the waiter says I have to wait for somemore time coz there are ppl waiting from 1 hour and they need to get their food first. And he went on ahead and said they cannot give me a time for when the food would be ready, coz they don't know exactly how long it would take.   Very rude behaviour from the waiter, even if the food is good the waiters can spoil your appetite with their behaviour."}
{"text":"Great food quality , taste , and portion. I ordered to - go and they brought me a soup and water bottle for free while I waited! Will go back."}
{"text":"I'm writing as I'm eating. This place is amazing. Red Curry w/ tofu is the best I've had in the valley and I've been on a mission trying to find it.   Really nice staff. Can't wait to try the Royal Curry"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town, have come here all the time and their food quality is consistent. The tom Ka has a great balance of sweet coconut milk and hot and sour flavor. The food portion is huge, I need a to go box every time when I order their dinner items. Their service is attentive. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of bad Thai food in Phoenix, so I was REALLY pleased to discover this place! We had the Pad See Yu and fresh rolls. Trust the waitress when she tells you that their 2-Star spicy is equivalent to 3-stars at other restaurants. Hot! Prices were cheap, too, and the waitress served us coconut ice cream with our bill. Legit."}
{"text":"I mean this place is OK, but not great and not even really \"good\". The fresh roll appetizer was a whole lot of rice noodles and a little bit of shrimp. The combination fried rice was what I'd expect from a cheap take-out Chinese place and the pad Thai was bland and not at all authentic. I'm very, very surprised at other reviews. Based on the positive reviews, I came here to eat, so Yelpers officially failed me this time. Fair warning."}
{"text":"The lemongrass soup. Go and get it because your life will change for the better. I've never felt so clear in my sinuses and I have horrible allergies and that was just a plus. If you like hot and sour, wonton, and whatever other Asian soup you're gonna love this stuff. Staff was friendly and had a home like feel. I will be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best Asian food I have tasted in the PHX/Scottsdale area.  Stopped in for my first time after landing at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  Unreal Green Pineapple Curry and Fresh Rolls."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal. The food was delicious, pleasant atmosphere and our waiter was friendly and attentive.  All around a great dinner. As others have mentioned, the coconut ice cream is delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a great little Thai place!   This is why I love Yelp, would have never found this place if it were not for Yelp. It's a tiny little place that you could easily pass by without noticing. There are only about 7 tables in the place. The workers are Thai and very nice and helpful in suggesting dishes.   My husband ordered the coconut soup and I got the royal Thai curry. They were both SO GOOD and the portion sizes were quite large. They also proved a scoop of ice cream for dessert!   Definitely suggest trying this place if you're in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"My friends love this place they always order takeout from here so I decided to try it. Came on Thursday night so it wasn't all too busy. It was cold out so I ordered Wonton soup. It was pretty good. Portion sizes are great and at the end we got a complimentary green tea ice cream which was delicious! My only issue was the service at the end when they took quite sometime to bring the check."}
{"text":"This place is the best Thai food in the valley. Blew me away. I asked for \"Thai hot\" masa mun curry and they delivered. Then they gave us complimentary green tea ice cream. Great service and great food. Thanks for putting up with me and my goofy ass friends!"}
{"text":"In from Denver and had an exceptional meal with my family. Red curry was superb as was the Thai basil. Our son had Pad Thai which I sampled and it was super as well. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"WORDS OF WISDOM: GET TAKE OUT GET TAKE OUT DO NOT EAT HERE GET TAKE OUT   Okay if you follow that, you will have a 5 star experience. We have gotten take out and have eaten it. I think you can tell which is better. The service here is awesome-- everyone is so friendly and helpful. The food here is by far the best Thai food I've ever had. To be clear, I do not like Thai food at all but I crave the food here all the time. The last time we came here I got my grandpa the stir fried snow pea on rice (I have no idea what it's called) and it was so good and fresh. My grandma who is picky had the pad see ew and it was indescribably delicious. I do not like pad see ew and I could eat this pad see ew every day. I had the pa nang curry with level 4 spice and it was incredible. I wish I could be more descriptive but just believe me that it is incredible, as is the yellow curry. The portions are also huge. Our meal for 4 could've fed 7-8 easily.   The price for the food is great and our server gave us complimentary green tea ice cream. This place could not be better (okay unless there were less flies and it weren't so small and ghetto)"}
{"text":"a friend of mine mentioned she tried this place for the first time tonight and was impressed with the taste, so i had to try it same day.  i love to support small business owners when i can and hope they can eventually move to a larger building once their profits soar.    food - SO good that this will be our go to thai restaurant from now on.  egg rolls, papaya salad, pad thai, curry - all great  heat - i have been able to take 'thai hot' at other restaurants but here i would stick with their 'level 5', maybe a 4 and then add some heat on my own.  we ordered the papaya salad (i think it was a 5 and was pretty hot for my mom...so they brought out some sticky rice/mango/coconut sauce to help soothe the burning lips - but it was SO good.  delivery - they only deliver on thurs, fri and within a 3 mile radius but i plan on taking my dinners to go if i dont end up eating there.  family - its family restaurant and we met the mom and she was fantastic.  the daughter was our server tonight and was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast thai food. It is definitely a hole-in-the-wall joint.  Like: Quality, variety, customer service Dislike: Neighborhood, Not many tables"}
{"text":"Pros: 1. Food is great, freshly made, good taste 2. Service is great. immediate seating (if there is space), attention to detail during service 3. Fast service with a smile 4. Private parking lot has about 15-20 spots 5. Buzzing place  Cons: 1. Place is too small, just 7-8 tables"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven;t tried this place before. The ambiance was great (date friendly!) and teh food was really good. Lots of authentic options and their spice level was right on. I want to go back and try more food. Soon. Service was great, place was pretty full and everyone was digging the food. Weird pillows on the seats. Just shove them aside. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix!!!! The grungy exterior is just part of the charm, similar to the green tea ice cream that comes after every meal. Everything I ordered has been exceptional they even have food that my vegan friend can eat. The staff is great and remember us each time we come in... maybe we come in too often? Not possible."}
{"text":"Well, the food was good...not bad, but not memorable ether.  I'd honestly say it's not worth a 5 rating in my humble opinion.  Malee's up in Scottsdale was by far superior in flavor and spice - that place will all out humble your ass in spice if you tell them too...and trust me, I can eat the heat!!    On a side note, and I'm a bit reluctant to note this on here but I'm going to anyway.  I made a nice poke at the owner while paying for my carry out.  I mentioned that i was really looking forward to eating this food...based on the reviews and all and that there was really only one good place for Thai food in Albuquerque and that was quite a ways from my home etc.  we talked a bit more and I shared that j grew up outside Detroit where we were blessed with amazing Thai food etc...among many other great/diverse cultural cuisines etc.  I mentioned that in Detroit we have a lot of Hmong and before I could finish...he interrupted me and just slammed them for \"thinking they know how to make Thai food\"...  Wow.  He went on a bit more but I just signed my slip, smiled and left.    Let me tell you Yelpers about the Hmong.  They were pretty much shit on all over Southeast Asia...after originally being pushed outta China.  After Vietnam, helping our troops navigate the Ho Chi Mihn trail...they basically had a bullseye in there back and had to again, flee yet another homeland.  The lucky ones made it here to the US in the late 70's.  As a result, they brought yet more culture and influence to the US.  Long story short,  their food is amazing.  I could name off seven restaurants in the Detroit area... Let alone the Tri-County area surrounding Detroit, that would absolutely rock your world with great tasting Thai food.  The red curry's are deep red... Their \"pad see ewe\"is a dark brown that is smoky and sweet at the same time.  Don't tell me that the Hmong do not know how to make Thai food... Because as far as I'm concerned, in my humble opinion... They make the best Thai food, period!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! My family and I been ordering takeout ever since they opened. They are very friendly, fast and the food is really good."}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry chicken, lunch portion.  Portion was decent for lunch and there was a hint of heat to the curry, but not overwhelming.  I also ordered a thai iced tea which was larger than other places.  My husband had the pad see ew beef, which is what I normally order at thai restaurants...unfortunately it was wayyy too salty.  The waiter was apologetic and he removed it from our bill which was very kind of him to do. Nice ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"Quite impressive.  A hot, simple, yet tasteful, cabbage cup of soup delivered upon seating.  The shrimp pad Thai and fresh spring rolls are a must.  Love the large Kerr jars of water with a slight hint of cuke.  Service friendly and super fast.  Comfy seating.  Great corner, easy-to-find location."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very affordable. Order the Drunken Noodle, you won't regret it. I've been to Thailand, that dish out does many dishes there. Friendly staff. Great lighting. Great vibe. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Being a Thai food junkie and a Los Angeles transplant, finding an awesome and might I add relatively authentic Thai joint has been a tad bit difficult here in the Valley of the Sun... Thankfully with a little digging I ran past some awesome articles about this joint so it was placed on the top of my list of must try restaurants!  It's a bit of a trek for me, but it was well worth it. The service was amazing, they were friendly and helpful without being over bearing! We ordered a bit of everything, and it was all amazing. Prices were super cheap for the quality and amount of food you get, I had days of leftovers and left full! They even gave us free desert (green tea ice cream!!!!!!)  I will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is great... We had be sweet and sour chicken, spicy beef and the pad Thai. Service was great, we will be back."}
{"text":"fantastic thai spot.  i'd be tempted to call it a hidden gem, but over 100 yelpers have already \"found\" it before me.  +1 for that hole-in-the-wall feel.  maybe 7 tables inside.  +1 for very friendly service.  +1 for good wonton soup, served as soon as we sat down.  +1 for great lunch prices.  +1 for great pad thai.  i'm not an expert on thai food, but this seemed pretty darn authentic.  one of the best meals we've had while vacationong in phoenix.  recommended!"}
{"text":"Note I always get the same thing twice a week because it's amazing sweet basil chicken with extra veggies lunch special. The staff is really friendly and always offers a free water bottle. It taste like fresh home made food although I've never tried home made Thai I'm sure this is what it would be like. It's a must!"}
{"text":"I was in AZ for a family trip so I searched on Yelp for a good Thai restaurant to eat.  Chanpen Thai Cuisine in the result with 4.5 stars.  So I can't here on 08/28/13 to try the food out.  It is a small house/building. Inside it is soooo small & only have a couple of small tables.   We orded 3 dishes, the drunken noodle, the pai thai, and the beef salad. The waiter, aka 1 man does all, he's the cashier, the bust boy, the order man. Omg, it take forever for him to come to our table & take the order, the next worst part is the food take about 40minutes to come. Omg, & the worst part is the food is so horrible, the noodle in the pai & the drunken noodle was all mushy/over cooked. The meat in all the dishes are not fresh & tasted weird. The beef salad was sooo salty. It's very pricey & it is the worst Thai food I have ever eat. Omg, what a wasted of money & time.  I will never never stop by here ever again when I'm in the area. They need to improve the food or shame on them for calling those horrible dishes Thai food."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for Thai food. If you have a chance give it a try. The food is amazing and the prices are great. To top it all of the service is great and everyone us extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch whenever I am in the area and in the mood. I always get the same thing because it's so good. Yellow Curry from the lunch menu at level 4 heat. It's fantastic. Perfect balance of sweet coconut and curry. Warning the place is really small, maybe 8 tables tops and they are divided into two rooms, so large parties would be difficult. Prices are great and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and every time it's amazing. The beef salad is the best I've ever tried, but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. The service is awesome and price is super fair. It's become the only Thai restaurant I go to, and that's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Very clean, fresh, light, good food. Friendly staff.  Unique. Different. Cucumber water in mason jars instead of plain water . Hard candy instead of fortune cookie. Good complimentary ice cream instead of cheap water based ice cream out of a machine."}
{"text":"Thai food here is the best in Phoenix. It is authentic and affordable. The people there are really nice. Usually when you done in they give you free green tea ice cream and agree water when you order take out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some panang curry and it was killer. Amazing flavor and rich texture.  I love my panang and this is top notch. They also nailed the heat factor. The guys at the front also helped with a special request side salad. Couldn't be happier. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Let's start with the atmosphere: this restaurant had this beautiful \"covered\" seating with romantic booths with red and black cushions covering the seats. There is an ambient soft Thai(?) music flowing in and out of our ears. Service was great, we walked in and seated ourselves, water was brought AS we sat down.  We ordered as soon as we were ready, and our appetizers (shrimp spring rolls) were somehow brought right after our menus were taken away.  Amazing. We didn't even finish our appetizers before our main courses (pork fried rice and yellow curry) were brought over.  HOLY HELL.  The flavor is amazing, presentation was great, and everything goes so well together.  Food seems extremely fresh and prepared with care."}
{"text":"Yelpers do not lie. This place is probably the best Thai restaurant I have tried so far at a reasonable price. Great tasty food, fresh ingredients, very friendly service and a true hole in the wall place.  Thai iced tea is not too sweet like most places. Try it if you can find it! (They close at 7:30ish daily)"}
{"text":"Delicious. We had the Royal curry (yellow), pad thai and flat noodles with gravy.  The guys were really nice and courteous too. Best Thai food we've had in a really long time."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch since this is just down the street. I love Thai food, especially the curries and pad thai. I also like the spice (although it doesnt love me). I ordered the red curry with tofu, thai hot for a spice level. I ordered it to go. The served me some vegan cabbage soup while I waited free of charge. The whole thing was ready to go in under 10 min. The surroundings were nice, comfortable. Got back to the office and have to say they got the spice right. You know when you start to cough and wheeze you've got the right level of spice. The veggies and tofu were perfect as was the rice. This is a great place for a quick lunch or casual dinner. They have a good selection and are a family owned business which means they are attentive and pleasant. I cant wait to see if their Thai coffee is up to snuff, which could be dangerous given their proximity to work :)"}
{"text":"Chanpen Thai has become a staple to my eating out routine. Mod and his team deliver phenomenal service, speedy delivery, and delicious food. You can never go wrong with the red or green curry, pad see yew, or pad Thai. I will continue to give my business to this wonderful gem of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Can really say much about this place, it's just so damn good. If u love Thai or just plain Asian food come and u won't be disappointed!  My favorite is their red curry"}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've ever had. Drunken noodles were fantastic. staff was incredibly friendly. Even brought out a complimentary ice cream for my 7 year old son and I. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm happy I went here! Just about The best panang curry and papaya salad I've ever had and I eat a lot of Thai :) I could taste the coconut and fresh lemongrass flavors in the curry, a very satisfying and dynamic dish. Papaya salad was really nice and not too spicy. I have been to some restaurants where this salad is only available in one (way too hot) spice level. Healthy size portions. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Listen to all the other reviews....do not get turned off by the exterior!! This is what you call  a hole in the wall. Unassuming, a bit discouraging from the outside but great food and even better customer service."}
{"text":"The restaurant only holds 20 people max.   It is clean and really not impressive.  The waiter was dressed very casually. Very helpful. Knew the menu.   Many vegetarian options.   I chose the massamon curry. You get enough for two people. It was excellent!  Slightly sweet but not too much. Ingredients were excellent. More tofu than I needed but excellent dish.   While I was finishing up the waiter brought me some green ice cream. I don't drink tea. I don't like tea. This green tea ice cream is wonderful!    Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the sweet Thai basil with tofu... It was amazing! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I ordered for pickup and the girl at the register was incredibly sweet - she gave me a bottle of water since it was hot outside even though I had also ordered some Thai tea. It is only a couple of minutes away from my work so I intend on coming here often. :)"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. The wait was 1 hour long since the place is super small. But don't let the looks of the place scare you. The food is awsome.  Salad,  soup, pad thai, chicken curry."}
{"text":"Rude customer service. Just did a pick up. They got the order incorrect. I confirmed that I had everything. And I did not and was to far to come back. The male was an ass. To let you know I am a high six income earner and they treated me like trash I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I really recommend this place! It was my first time going the place is clean the waiters are super kind always on top of things. Customer service was lovely didn't have to ask for anything. Great infused cucumber water they give you to start. Food was delicious let's not forget the free coconut ice cream scoop they give you after your meal! It was delicious! I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, I always get take out, and they always comp me an item or throw in a drink for free. I love their Pad Thai, I drive 20 minutes to pick it up and it's worth every penny. Not a lot of parking available, not a lot of seating either."}
{"text":"I work in South Phoenix and it's very much a food desert for the intrepid soul who seeks something other than Jack in the Box for lunch. I was happy to see that there was a Thai place on yelp and tried it right away.  I really like Chanpen a lot--for starters, the food is great. I've tried a lot of things off the lunch menu, the red curry, yellow curry, spicy sweet basil, drunken noodles, and spicy fried rice. I was not disappointed by any of these. I also love the fact that there are five levels of spice, and if I order level 5, it's actually spicy! It clears my sinuses. Finding food that I actually think it spicy is really hard for me, and at least one of my five stars is for this reason alone.  I do think it's probably better to get take out than dine in here since the place is small. They are great at take out--they are extremely accommodating. If you have a bunch of cash from your office staff they will do each order separately and give you change individually. They will put one or two on a card and the rest cash. Anything you want--plus an extremely convenient box for your mass order of food and free water bottles. They're also pros at taking phone orders, I swear sometimes I'll call a pizza or other takeout place and the person on the phone is clueless and doesn't understand what I say--but for one, the number system of the lunch specials and spice level makes ordering easy, and for two, the staff is just good at what they do.  If you DO dine in for lunch, the cabbage soup is very tasty.  The price for lunch is excellent. The portion size is perfect for lunch and they give you quality over a quantity which yields leftovers. The little spring roll that comes with your meal is crisp and tasty. I've had beef and chicken in the lunch specials and they've both been delicious.  I definitely recommend Chanpen to anyone who wants Thai in the South Phoenix area, and also the Tempe-but-close-to-south-phoenix area."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup, the restaurant is small and was pretty busy when I went. I got the Pad Thai on a medium heat and pretty much died because it was mega hot. Serving size was solid or maybe it felt like more because my stomach was on fire. Would try again on mild for less burning."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix. We live in Buckeye but we will definitely make the trip back here for dinner again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today based off of reviews from others on here and because it is so close to my work; I'm so happy I did.  The staff was very friendly, offering me a bottle of water and a cup of soup while I was waiting on my food to go.  The place was packed, and the staff was very attentive to all tables.  The service was quick too, and when I got back to work I was even more pleasantly surprised when I found out the wonton soup was a gigantic tub.  It was amazing, and I have leftovers for dinner. :)"}
{"text":"This place is always packed but its so worth the wait. The curry here is so amazing it will without a doubt impact your life."}
{"text":"Love this place! The family is great and always welcoming. On pick up orders they usually give you a free bottle of water. The food is amazing, could be a little spicier but that's my opinion.  The lunch specials are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tempe is a hike for us. Chanpan was worth the drive due to the following:  Atmosphere - casual dining, quiet nice space.  Staff - kind and knowledgeable about their products yet busy even at 9pm on a Saturday night.  Food - amazingly good, spice was just right, portions very generous, flavors outstanding. We ordered our usual Pad Thai, Silver Noodle Soup, and Chicken Satay. Each of our selections stood the test of our extensive Thai Food experiences with the exception of never having been to Thailand, definitely on the bucket list though!"}
{"text":"Delicious spot. When I say a hole in the whole it really is. Leaving the restaurant boundaries I feel I'll be in a part of some Boyz N The Hood movie. lol By far the food I have tried is amazing. I tried the noodle soup and it was perfect. The service was very friendly. The dessert was on point. I got the sticky rice mango and it was perfect. Still more to try on the menu so I'll give it a 4 star for now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant! The coconut curry soup is to die for. The Pad-See Yu has a wonderful seasoning on the flat noodles and a medley of mussels, shrimp, calamari and fried fish. You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes. This is a tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant in South Phoenix. It's definitely a well known secret! People come from all over to enjoy this cuisine."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have another location closer to my work but it is filthy and slow so I make the trek to the Baseline location. The lunch specials offer good sized portions for the money and are very consistent. The silver noodle soup (not a lunch special) is huge and probably my favorite thing to order on a cold day. Service is generally pretty good, you may need to flag someone down for your check or a box. I put this above Thai Basil or Thai Elephant most of the time."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting Thai food that's made quickly. The waitstaff is still working on their English but polite and quick. They also gave a free ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"My friend had spicy eggplant with tofu and okay. I had pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp and we shared Shrimp fresh rolls. Our biggest concerns were no Thai beer for sale and food was not piping hot. I did like my Thai iced tea and we were pleasantly surprised with coconut ice cream. This place mostly does takeout but there is seating for about 25 people at max."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix  The restaurant is small and the parking lot is located in such a inconvenient area but hey, it's worth it! food is delicious and the waiter/waitress are friendly:) price is reasonable! Oh! And you must try their iced coffee"}
{"text":"Came back for another vist, I was much more impressed! Great customer service! Amazing food :)"}
{"text":"It is obvious that this place knows what they are doing.  The small venue looks to be on purpose so that they don't attract too many customers.  Unassuming, quaint, whatever you want to call it, the food was baller.  The service was amazing, and everything tasted like a nice ol' thai grandma was in the back making it special for you.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Review 3/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  After being dismissed from jury duty, I wanted to celebrate having a half day free so I headed over to Chanpen to indulge in some tasty Thai food! They currently have a good selection of lunch specials for $7.95 that includes a small eggroll, soup, and wonton crisps. I decided on the red curry with tofu, Thai hot.   The interior is cute with sunny warm accents and unique decor. I might have indulged in a Thai iced tea had the server asked me if I wanted an additional drink after taking my order, but for my meal today I stuck with my tall Mason jar of water with lime wedges.   The soup was served first, piping hot. It was a clear, well seasoned broth with cabbage, celery, and cilantro. The rest of the meal came out fairly quickly, and had a nice presentation. The curry had a lot of fried tofu and vegetables. The curry itself was more like a regular hot to me, hot enough to sear the tongue a little but not enough to really make my nose run. The wonton crisps were light with good crunch, and the eggroll was pretty basic, served with a super sweet sauce.  Service was speedy and my check was presented to me when I was halfway done through my meal, so if you are in a rush for lunch this is a good choice to eat.   Overall it was a pleasant meal and I'd go back to try more items if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Tiny little broken down shack, didn't look clean or sanitary at all. They say don't judge a book by its cover but not when it comes to something your putting in your mouth."}
{"text":"Was driving through Phoenix and decided to check it out based on all of its reviews. The food was super delicious. I got the stir fry garlic with chicken and it was so good. A spice level of 3 was perfect. They brought us ice cream out at the end too! The staff was so nice. The food came out super quick. Highly recommend it if you like good Thai food."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like you are at home.  Everyone is super friendly and welcoming.  The FOOOOOOD is spectacular!!! I have a lot of food allergies so having accommodations made to the dish really helps me when I'm trying to go out on date night and eat a nice meal.  I am even able to bring my very own special coconut amino sauce and not have to use soy sauce.  If you really want a great authentic Thai meal and be treated like family and not aped a fortune, check out chanpen!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Thai food. Always great service and quick! I love the pad Thai and green curry."}
{"text":"Scary at first but food and service are amazing!!! Take number 5 spicy it's great!!!! Will visit again for sure"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai lunch special meal you will get in the greater Tempe area. There are many like it, but this one is the best. They serve the best Asian spaghetti I've ever had."}
{"text":"Parking: spacious, lot.   Service: slow, they're nice but understaffed   Environment: clean and nice decor   Food: great food with great flavors. Silver noodles. Great. Clear noodles with chicken, shrimp, broccoli, carrots and baby corn. Pad see ew chicken. fat noodles with veggies, fried egg and chicken. Highly recommend. And yellow curry. Great flavors in the curry with chicken and potatoes.   Docked once star for slow service. Been here twice and will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"It is in a kinda sketchy hood, and I would just get take out, it only has like four tables in it.   However, the food was very fresh and flavorful.  I have nothing to complain about, my Pad SeeYew (?) was the best I've had in town.  It is very far from my house,  so I don't think I will be visiting frequently.  But Tempe folk and south siders should feel lucky to have this place.  Chanpen and her daughter are very friendly ladies."}
{"text":"the food is great and the prices are reasonable. Please do not judge the outside appearance of the restaurant because they have so much potential inside. I got that Pat Thai and it was delicious along with a crab puffs. If you are in the neighborhood I would definitely recommend stopping by. it is 1 of the only south Phoenix Thai restaurants so you should check it out."}
{"text":"The restaurant is VERY tiny and doesn't seat many, but it worth waiting for a seat. The outside isn't much to look at, but the food was fantastic! They had a large menu offering many options. We had a curry dish and drunken noodles. Both were perfect levels of spice and had lots of flavor. The service was excellent. We'd go back!"}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said, this place looks like a dive from both the outside and the inside.  I drove by the restaurant before realizing I passed it.  After we parked, we went inside where there are very few tables.  Even at the odd hour (2PM lunch), the place had a decent amount of people.  There were a few empty tables so we grabbed one.  By the time we figured out what we wanted and ordered, the empty tables were gone.  People were constantly coming in to pick up their takeout orders.  My wife ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  I ordered the pad thai with chicken and shrimp.  After tasting the pad thai (a little sweet for my taste, but maybe they added a little too much sweetness that day), I tried my wife's drunken noodles.  Have you ever tried your spouse's dish and you didn't want to give it back?  Yeah, this was one of those days.  The fresh basil in these noodles is so refreshing.  We finished our leftovers as a second meal later that day.  The best part about the drunken noodles is they taste really healthy.  In fact, so healthy we felt hungry after eating them (like having salad healthy).  The pad thai was more filling, but it was a little sweet for me.  We ordered some vegetarian egg roll appetizers which were okay too.    Next time, I think we're both ordering drunken noodles with chicken!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for an early dinner on valentines day. Would say the food was outstanding but the ambiance left much to be desired. The service was great, and they even gave us a free cupcake to celebrate valentines.  Again the food was amazing. We both had Pad Thai, probably should have shared but she likes it mild and I spicy. The server suggested I only get a 3-4/5 and he was right. It was perfect. I will definitely eat there again, but more likely as takeout since it is an easy drive on the way home from work."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food place! I can't go anywhere else! And I've gotten many friends hooked on it too! Anywhere I go, I usually stick with the same meals, so here we always get potstickers, pad Thai and yellow curry, which is all amazing so I'm sure everything else is! The service is always great as well! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning here. :-/ Wouldn't recommend. While the service was quick & prices were cheap- the fact that it's located in the ghetto of Phx and resembles a sort of hole in the wall, I knew better not to go but thought I'd give it a try. I've been sick for 2 days since I've eaten there. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is tiny and absolutely packed at lunch time. Definitely hole in the wall decor - but the food is outstanding! I had the Pad Thai and I have to say it was the best I've ever had. A+"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Phoenix. All their curry dishes are great. Once in awhile they have specials avocado curry and fried pork ribs which are both amazing. Crab puffs all day for appetizers."}
{"text":"PSA....This place is rather small so be prepared to wait. I found this place on Yelp.  I odered the Tom Yum noodle soup and got it at a spice level of 5.  Which is their highest.  Being half Thai myself I normally get a 10 at other places. Boy was I surprised at how HOT a 5 is there!!! It was so delicious and was worth my extreme sweating!  I did stop at a McDonalds that was down the street afterwards for an ice cream cool down."}
{"text":"I actually have been going here for a while now. The food was excellent. Though the past 3 times I have gone the food has declined rapidly. Super soggy noodles and still frozen crab puffs aren't my idea of a good meal."}
{"text":"First time I ate there today. Sorry that I did not take pics. Reasonably priced and clean. The two gentleman there were friendly and accommodating. I ordered tofu with chicken, noodles, soy bean and broccoli. I did not leave any for manners... great experience! Would definitely recommend and will definitely return"}
{"text":"We've going here for a while now.  It's really good Thai food! Possibly the best.  The only downside is the consistency.  Sometimes it tastes like the best and for some reason or another it tastes different a week or two later.  We always enjoy the specials here."}
{"text":"We love this place.  When visiting relatives in Phoenix, we seek out new Thai restaurants.  We finally found this restaurant.  We got won-ton soup, Basil chicken, drunken noodle.  Everything here is fresh, delicate, and tasty."}
{"text":"The food was really good but when you begin to notice the details, it's filthy!  Sticky, wet bathroom floor and a toilet that won't flush. And look at the rest of the floor, walls and chair legs. Gross. Lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Authentic, healthy, and delicious. Great service and a great price. The green curry is amazing! I took my family and had a great time. They gave us coconut/pineapple ice cream for dessert.  I will highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been in this place couple times since I knew them from their first location in Broadway Rd.  The flavors quite authentic, fresh, and consistent.  The services are awesome and fast, the owner very helpful and friendly. I always back to order Tom Yam shrimp, fried rice, and dessert mango sticky rice.  Very highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"It's true that is the best Thai food :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Thai restaurant near my house for some time now. I love curry and that is the only thing I get along with app when visiting  Thai restaurants. I had the green curry and my guest had the Pa Nang curry. Both awesome!  My next trip I will be sure to try the soup  as I saw many tables ordering this."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Had the yelp curry, pineapple fried rice, chicken satay. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Phoenix area! I was lucky enough to be out in the Tempe area for a work conference and was recommended Chanpen by a coworker. Two thumbs up! Not only did we go twice in one week, but I had the best spicy Thai I've yet to eat in Arizona. I will definitely be driving back on a regular basis from north Phoenix--worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this one..but eh. Called in order at 130pm, I ordered pad thai lunch special and pineapple fried rice at full dinner price, no special there.   When I went to pick up the only parking available was directly in front of the main door, ok cool. Went inside, closed the door behind me..no special aromas hit me. Secondly it's so tiny and mind you I am not a big person, but geeze this place is small.  People sitting at tables automatically stare at you while you stand in line at the counter to pay. I also got the Thai iced tea, it was ok, it had great big chunks of sticks at the very bottom that came up thru my straw, not cool. Haven't these people heard of a strainer..? Anyway on to the food.   The pad thai combo was nothing special, I asked for medium spice it came out mild.  The pineapple fried rice was ok, again asked for medium and got mild. eh. whatever. It did satisfy the thai craving I had, but was nothing wonderful..and for all this I paid 22 bucks, and got exactly 3 shrimp I believe, can't recall just remember feeling really underwhelmed by the whole experience. Yes I would eat here again, but no I would not give them 5 stars for quality and price."}
{"text":"Unlikely looking location but phenominal food to be had inside! I've had the yellow curry and the Pad Thai here and both have been excellent. Small restaurant with huge flavor!"}
{"text":"After hearing several rave reviews of this place, we decided to check it out on a Saturday night. It's a few miles from home and it's new, so the positive reviews made it a must.  What we hoped would be a rare family dinner out (our son was even on his best behavior) ended up turning into a takeout experience. We were too hungry to wait behind another group for one of the very few tables. No biggie -- I just wish I had been better warned that it's tough to get a table here.  Our takeout order was ready in a little over ten minutes, maybe fifteen, and the server/cashier offered us a couple of complimentary bottled waters as we waited. So we were impressed with the friendly service and good communication from the kitchen. We ordered a couple of noodle dishes, including pad thai, as well as a curry entree. All were excellent, with subtle yet flavorful sauces and veggies cooked just right. We shall return soon and try the dine-in experience, maybe on a weeknight."}
{"text":"I'm all for authentic hole in the wall spots, I yelped this place and based on reviews we decided to try it.  We ordered for pick up so today I decided to eat the soup I ordered and it taste really good until I pulled a hair out of the noodles it was intertwined therefore it was not our hair. To my disgust I dumped it in the drain. It seams this place is very unsanitary to begin with. Like I said I will try hole in the wall spots and I originally got by the filthiest kitchen I've seen.  Lesson learned view kitchen before ordering food..  Really over priced"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The food is excellent. Things you must try, tom yum soup, pad kee mao, tom kha soup, garlic chicken and mango delight. Their green tea ice cream is to die for, another must try item (though not on the menu, I think)."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 5 stars before even getting the food! The gentleman that was handling my to go order was amazing! He offered me a water bottle and gave me my Thai tea while I waited. He even offered to top off my Thai tea if I drank some! He's very attentive, friendly, and productive  As for the food, holy cow, 3 out of 5 spice level and my nose is running! I got the pad see yew and it was at my expectation level. Great food! I'll definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"I visited this place today on the recommendation of a friend that it was legit Thai food. I was also told it was a tiny place, but to my delight, both were spot on and I was not disappointed in the least.   They have basically two areas to sit in, one is a tucked away corner on the left of the entrance, where a few booths line wall, the other is the main dining area, which is basically what you walk into when you pass through the front door. There are (literally) a handful of tables there, but they each seat about four people. Definitely a small place, but not uncomfortably small. I would call it cozy, at least until the gets really full, at which point it probably borders on tight quarters for most folks. I can also see how it would be a bit annoying to sit near the door, which an unsettling number of patrons were too silly to close behind themselves when entering. My advice? Go early and try to grab a booth to put some distance between yourself and the hustle-n-bustle.   So on to the food, tried a variety of dishes today and they were all fantastic. First up, appetizers -both the crab puffs and the chicken satay were outstanding. Flavorful, perfectly cooked and, in the case of the crab puffs, not at all greasy or heavy. The crab puffs are a good deal, as you get eight of them, which is more than enough for one person and plenty if you're sharing with a the rest of your table. For the entree, I went with their fried rice and chicken, which was great. The portion size, both of the chicken pieces as well as the fried rice, were generous and I did not want for more. Being a lunch special, it also came with an egg roll, which was pretty decent, and some wontons. Between the appetizers and the entree, I left well and truly full, which is always a good thing.   In terms of service, while there isn't a lot of staff, it was definitely a controlled chaos when it came to getting everyone what they needed. Our appetizers came out relatively quickly, followed in short order by the entrees, and even the drink refills were fairly prompt. I was pleasantly surprised, given that the tail end of our visit fell squarely into the lunch rush.   I will caution would-be diners that parking is a bit of a chore, so carpooling is highly recommended if you are visiting with friends or colleagues. It helps if you go early, but by the time you leave, the lot will invariably be approaching capacity and you'll end up in tight quarters. The orientation essentially means you have to back out towards the entrance, unless you can find a way to turn around. Not a problem in a small car, or when the lot is sparsely filled, but at the peak, it's another story. More free advice? If you go early, spend the time to turn around and back into your parking spot. When you come out to a full lot, you'll be glad you did.   Definitely a solid entry in the \"hole in the wall\" category, but this place has a lot of character and authentic food, so I'd gladly go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I just moved from Gilbert Az. to South Phoenix and unfortunately, there are not too many great restaurants here. Thai and Indian are my favorite, so I was delighted to notice this tiny hole-in-the-wall Thai place open up on Broadway just west of 28th St. You really need to pay attention not to pass this place up. They decor inside is very quaint. They can probably only fit about 15-20 people packed tight, but I love places like this and  I've been sad not to see more cars in front and I finally got to go last night and brought a friend and we both LOVED it! We were they only ones there (at 5:30p) but about 6 other patrons rolled in over the next 30 minutes or so. We pigged out too (hey, I wanted to support the business!). We had green curry with pork, drunken noodles, Tom Kha Gai (coconut/lemon-grass soup) and for desert, we ordered a sticky rice with mango (choices are mango or ice crème...no custard unfortunately), plus they brought us a free fried banana (looked like egg rolls) with chocolate sauce (I had to bring about half of all this home). Everything was incredibly good. I would give the top-most rating to the soup. The portion of mango on the sticky rice was massive. I'd guess 1/4 pound. I suspect that won't last long once they get established, but who knows. I'm sure they are trying extra hard to please and we were! The only complaint I have is their Thai coffee was too sweet. Still pretty good, but if I have that problem again, I will let them know. I will definitely go back and hope others will too to ensure they stay survive. A nice little oasis in this Thai-barren desert. One last note, Thai Basil is one of my favorites and as far as food quality and flavor goes, I would say these two are about the same."}
{"text":"Surprised by the reviews raving about the coconut soup. I was longing for this dish as it is my favorite Thai dish along with yellow curry. I ordered it a few times a month when I loved in CA. Decided to give this place a try hoping to find a thai restaurant here in phoenix. Ordered the soup for take home/pick up.  The soup was very disappointing to say the least. It didn't have lemon grass or chicken as it does elsewhere. It had a few mushrooms and there was a layer of oil on top which had separated from the base. It tasted awful and I threw it out. I hate to waste food and thus will eat things that aren't great as to not waste but I just couldn't stomach it. As for now I wait for my trips back to CA to order Thai food. Hope to find a good Thai place out here though. Here's hoping, fingers crossed lol. Hope I don't have to waste more food and money in the process."}
{"text":"Fabulous Thai Food. This place is pretty interesting and the reason I am a Yelp Addict. It takes a small, run down area of town and exposes a Thai Hot Spot. The setup is small, lots of lunch take out.   Service is always friendly here, they bring you a small cup of soup complimentary:   I stick to the yellow curry or pad tai with fresh rolls as an app. Both are top notch.   I will be here again for my neighborhood lunch spot from work."}
{"text":"Supper yummy Thai food and complementary green tea ice cream when you dine in! Pad se ew and panang curry are so good!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had.    I'm more of a fan of various regional Chinese cooking, but I found out that the reason for that is I had not gotten to Chanpen Thai Cuisine until recently!  Once I had THEIR food, I realized what I had been missing.  We go to the Broadway, Phoenix location, and that is what this review references.  Our three favorite dishes are the Lemon Grass Soup (otherwise known as Tom Yum Soup), the Crispy Chicken (from the chalkboard specials on the wall near the cash register) and the Spicy Sweet Basil Stir Fry.    You have a choice of meats in the soup and the stir-fry, so choose your favorite -it really doesn't matter.  They're all good.  The Lemon Grass Soup has a rich, homemade broth and a wonderful and aromatic lemon grass kick.  I LOVE Tom Yum, and this is easily the best I've ever had.  Truly tastes like your Thai Grandma would've made!  Crispy Chicken is fried crisp and tossed with a sauce that'll make you a believer with the very first bite.  How can I say this?  It tastes EXACTLY like you want it to.  Spot on.  Tangy.  Hot.  Savory.  Sweet.  You know that aroma that's in the air outside a good Asian restaurant?  The smell that tells you they're 'doing it right'?  Well, that's what this dish TASTES LIKE!  Woo hoo!  The Spicy Sweet Basil stir-fry has plenty of the key ingredient and it gets right down to business on your palate.  Spicy sweet it is, yes, but the depth of flavor is excellent.  Can't miss with this one.  We've also eaten their curries, which are served in deep bowls and are quite good.  There is one that is super rich and creamy with coconut milk.  I believe it is the Pa-Nang Curry.  Luxuriously rich, and almost too heavy, but very, very good.  The red, green or yellow curries are not as thick and rich, but are good nonetheless.  I could go on, but... if you like Thai food, I'm sure you get the idea.  Plus, the location and facilities are sketchy as they come. (It's a \"plus\" because I love 'sketchy' places.)  If you're skittish, go during mid-to-late afternoon.   Daylight.  Don't do lunch at peak hours.  Crowded, and they only have a half-dozen tables."}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff were nice. You get cucumber water to drink as your water.  Wonton soup was big enough to feed two and the chow mein was flavorful. I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I'm so happy they have a 2nd location. The food is amazing and I love the ambiance of the new place. Plus, this location is open later!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is my go to Thai restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside and the place is tiny. However, the food is fantastic and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Great food! I used carry out and they gave me a cold bottle of water! Great idea in the Arizona heat."}
{"text":"Best Thai we have had in Phoenix. Food was out in under 10 minutes and tasted delicious. Service was great and he even brought out green tea ice cream for us before we left. We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Visited family in the area and they brought us to this restaurant. Food was full of flavor.  You are able to choose your level of spice on each dish from 0-5. I chose 4 and it was a little bit hotter than I had guessed. But was awesome! Place was very clean with a great atmosphere. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The place is tiny. We had a large group of 15 and we barely fit in.  The Thai food was genuinely some of the best I've had.  The service was quick and friendly. They were very accommodating to out large group.    We ordered all the dishes at level 1 spice except for one we got level 5.  The level 1 was perfect for those who don't like heat and the 5 was enjoyably hot for those that do.    I don't live near Phoenix but I will remember to get some Thai food next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Outstanding, inexpensive Thai.  We had fabulous Tom Ka Gai, a great green curry with duck, excellent Thai iced tea and coffee. And they gave us free green tea ice cream.  You can't eat better Thai than this in the state of Arizona.  I was in Thailand three months ago and it wasn't any better than here.  Can't recommend highly enough.  Definitely not fancy, but great food and instant service."}
{"text":"If this place doesn't define mom and pop...i dot know what does. Very small location in a rough part of south Phoenix, but oh man...the food! My favorite is the shrimp and chicken Pad Thai and the Iced Thai tea. Price is very affordable and on most days, they will give you a free bottled water while you wait. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, extremely busy. Difficult to get a seat or service, but I'd say it's worth it. They don't play when it comes to spice so be careful. I ordered very spicy on my drunken noodle and I was sweating."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, definitely a deceiving appearance for the quality inside the place, worth the visit"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant! I've eaten many Pad Thais, but I just can't get over theirs! I always want to try something new (which I have, like their delicious drunken noodles), but I always resort back to the Pad Thai.  Their Thai ice coffee is also always a must-have and their complimentary green tea ice cream always brings me back!  Their service is also exceptional and I always feel like I'm at home."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food -- some of the best we have had around here!! The wait staff was so kind and the restaurant was nice and clean.  The complimentary ice cream was a great wait to end the meal. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially their lunch specials! Large portions and really great Thai food. Better for takeout, really small inside"}
{"text":"The food is reallyyy good and I have had a lot of Thai food at really high end places too. The customer service is really good too. They are all very humble. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a diamond in the rough. I mean the place is small but don't let that fool you. The food is phenomenal. I had the chicken and shrimp pad Thai which was delicious. I also ordered some beef chow mein and it was slightly spicy but that addicting spicy. The Thai iced tea is refreshing and overall a unique dining experience for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick late lunch for work. We had the Pad Thai with Chicken & spring rolls. For dessert, we got the fried banana with ice cream. The dessert was delicious! However, halfway through my pad Thai, I found a strand of short hair on my plate. I knew it was definitely not mine or my friend's. I was enjoying the pad Thai and was SO disappointed to find hair in my food... that's literally one of my pet peeves/worst nightmares. I know everyone makes mistakes, but it doesn't make the situation any less disappointing. I do however still think that the food in general was good, and the service was superb. I was in a rush when I went, but the server was very attentive to our needs.  This is kind of a loner small house/building along Broadway. There is a small parking lot right outside of it. It's small on the inside, and the food was delicious. But because of the hair, I probably won't come back here for a while."}
{"text":"This place is located about 2 miles from Sky Harbor. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by after dropping off a friend from the airport. We went here on a weekday roughly one hour before closing. My first impression was that the parking lot was super dark. They didn't have very good lighting. The outside of the restaurant did not look too fancy, a little on the shabby side. As I walked into the restaurant, there were two booth and four regular tables. We were the only ones dining in at this hour, but there were a good number of people ordering togo.   The food made up for that superficial notion. We had the drunken noodles with chicken level 3, which is equivalent to medium spice. The noodles were absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed the pineapple red curry with tofu & veggies, level 3 spice.  I might bump up the spice level to 4 next time to get a stronger kick.  Overall, there were adequate food portions, and everything was reasonably priced. The best part was getting free complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of our meal, which brought a huge smile to my face.   The service was outstandingly fast, efficient, and friendly. My food came out in a timely manner. I will definitely be returning when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"The previous reviews don't lie, this place is TINY! We called and ordered ahead and our food was ready in ten minutes.  I had the pineapple red curry with combination seafood at level 3 spice. It was indeed spicy, but still very flavorful. The portion was quite large, enough for 2-3 meals for me. Definitely will be eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! The potstickers were ok, not the best ever.   I would have given 5 stars but the fresh rolls we wanted to order were not available. Hopefully they will be available next time to try."}
{"text":"Excellent food ... ordered dinner for carry out.  Had the Spicy Sweet Basil (combination) entree and chicken wings.  Ordered a 3 on their hotness scale which was perfect for me!!  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is just as good as the original location. The new location has a much better ambiance and room for bigger crowds. Same great service too."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Thai restaurant to go to in Tempe so I pulled out Yelp and decided to try Chanpen. We meet our son and his friends so he got our table first.   The place seemed fairly large with lots of tables. Just a normal restaurant and fairly clean. I could tell the servers were of Thai descent. Very casual because we were missing table serving and they just handed to us at one end of the table and they had us hand it down the line. No problem with this at all. Gets the job done. Just a very casual type of place.   We started off with Fresh Rolls with Shrimp and Thai Egg Rolls. One thing was made very clear by my wife is when she took the first bite of the Fresh roll is that the outer skin of the roll was very fresh. Been to lots of places and it's been pre-made sitting in refrigerator. This was very fresh very good. Adding the dipping sauce and I'm in heaven. Really good we loved it. The egg roll were really good but again dipping in their dipping sauce was so good. We just loved their appetizers.   I got the Pad-Thai with Shrimp and Chicken. I didn't get it too spicy so it was on the sweet side. I think that if I got it spicier then the mixture of sweetness and spicy would have made it really good but then again I really like it. It's a pretty big portion and cooked just how I asked for it. I liked it a lot.   So my wife ordered a Thai coffee so sweet drink with a sweet meal is very sweet. Really good overall. To end our meal they gave us complementary Coconut ice cream. One nice scoop. It was really good. It had some pineapple inside too.   So we had a really good meal. Food was really good. Nice atmosphere. Good but not great service. I'm saying this cause they got one of our orders wrong and someone sit there for awhile without their meal. That's okay. It's a very casual environment. If you go expect good service but not great.   We will probably be back. We'll see. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it's just ok.  My benchmark for red curry is Thai Basil on Rural. That,  to me, is the best. In relation this is a 2.5.  It's really thick which is weird and the vegetables don't seem to be fresh. The service really isn't great either. It's just mediocre in my book but not terrible either."}
{"text":"As we walked in a man asked whether we can cash his check. In the parking lot. In broad day light. The parking lot was packed and boxed outside of the restaurant indicated newly delivered veggies. It smelled fantastic. We walked in to what looked like a shack. We looked around and there was about 9 tables, all of which were taken. No one greeted us, no one said hey.. we can do a to go order... nothing... so we left."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find! This place is amazing! The best Pad-Thai we've had since Thailand 4 years ago. Looks like nothing from outside but a total treasure. Pure happiness!"}
{"text":"Popped in for the first time- this is really great food and we are a little snobby about Thai. Had the shrimp fresh rolls, pad Thai, coconut curry and were served coconut ice cream scoops at the end of the meal.  Really sweet staff and a cute little restaurant despite it being in the strip of a Freys supermarket. Total bill was $36 including a $6 tip. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside scare you away! This place is amazing, very small but an amazing hole in the wall gem! My fiancé and I love Thai food and are huge foodies and decided to give this place a try and we were more than impressed! Thai tea, amazing! Pad Thai, amazing! A little on the sweet side for the pad Thai but still really good. Spicy friend combination rice, out of this world!! Wonderful flavor overall!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Thai restaurants for 35 years. This was one of the better restaurants I've been too. Not fancy, but the food was excellent & service very good. The pad Thai was good - above average - and the pumpkin red curry was very good. I ordered Thai got my wife got her pad Thai level 2 (mild+) and both were perfectly spiced. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I order the Chicken Pad See Ew for lunch, and it was ready by the time I arrived. Great customer service, they had a table for me ready to enjoy this delicious flavorful most amazing lunch this week. Despite the place being in high demand they did not lack of friendly welcoming and serious speedy service. Will definitely be a regular here!   Kudos to everyone in the kitchen and the guys taking orders and doing everything else!  Thank you   Happy Customer    Lunch hour madness well managed!!"}
{"text":"The servers were friendly. They ask you to rate your level of spiciness (1-5?) when ordering which I liked since I like Thai food to be a little flavorful. It is located in a strip mall next to boba/donut place. The pad see ew was delicious. The pad thai had an orange hue that I was not used to. Everything else was great. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant. Highly recommend the pad Thai, spicy fried rice, and the green curry."}
{"text":"I had the papaya salad without shrimp and the pad-see-ewe. Excellent!! Finally I found somewhere that makes it the way I like. Very reasonable.  I'd definitely recommend it.  Hole in the wall place with good AC"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!!! Great food and iced green tea is delicious! I def recommend this spot and would come back."}
{"text":"Started coming to this restaurant on a regular basis and cannot say enough good things. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food is some of the best that we've had in the state - and we've tried many places.   If you are looking for a good spicy noodle dish, then I recommend the drunken noodles. The curry is also delicious. We haven't gotten though the menu yet - far from it - but it seems that everything that comes out of the kitchen is worth it.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So inconspicuous!!! In town for business and used Yelp to help locate a great local spot to eat. Beware, looks a little questionable from the outside but well worth walking in.   Delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"I went to this place because their menu on yelp -I get there and ordered the sea food mix, what they bought me was horrible, I showed the waiter the picture and he said oh we don't serve that anymore, I also tried ordering the beef salad and they were out of beef! What!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed when trying here! There are so many good reviews so i was very excited only to be let down. My Tom Kha wasn't flavorful...just spicy. And they didnt light the middle on fire! I always look forward to that fun bit l: the fresh spring rolls(she had to check in the back if they had any; not fresh made!) tasted old and like the vegetables had sat out for tooooooo long. Not the crunch you're looking for. My boyfriends panang curry tasted like it was a premade sauce or package. Quite frankly all of it did. Its not too special in my eyes, I felt i had wasted $30."}
{"text":"As soon as I landed at Sky Harbor I looked on Yelp to find my dinner spot for the night. Based on the reviews, I knew this was it. It didn't disappoint!! In fact, we went 3 times in 5 days!! It's very small, but worth the wait if a table isn't available. The yellow curry was my favorite. We also enjoyed the see yew and fried rice. Can't wait to go back in May when I'm in town!! The employees were so nice and worked hard. They gave us free bottled water on all of our visits."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Thai restaurant and I crave it all the time! The service is amazing, the staff is always genuinely friendly and attentive, and the food always comes out reasonably fast! I love their pad-see-ew (savory wide noodles) and their yellow curry is awesome too! I also love their spicy fried rice and mango with sweet rice dessert. Those are usually my go-to dishes and I've never been disappointed. I hate when I try a place I like but they don't have consistently good food, where my next visit yields a completely different taste. Not the case here, they always deliver delicious food every time. That's why I'll skip the Thai restaurants close to me and drive the 15 minutes to eat here instead."}
{"text":"Local gem!  Very small, six tables inside. Big flavor, great service and worth waiting for a table.  I have eaten here four times now and extremely satisfied each time.  Don't let the location fool you are cause you to drive by.  You can order your food on a spicy scale 1-5.  I like spicy and a 2 is about my limit here."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!!!! Food and service Solid Gold!! 10!! Mod had amazing recommendations. We had dumplings and fresh shrimp rolls to start. Both chicken and shrimp in Pad Thai- mild and sweet! Loved the fresh bean sprouts and crumbled peanuts piled high on side. But if you like spice... The drunken noodles and the Royal curry were both out of this world! Beer and wine. Final surprise...green tea ice cream.  Don't Miss this place!!   In town at Arizona Grand for few days with no car. 10 min walk and worth it!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this spot! I work close by and go here at least weekly. The owner is very pleasant and remembers my name, and the servers always offer water while I wait for pickup orders. They make an AMAZING sweet spicy basil! Check out their lunch specials, they have very generous portions for the price!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great and am a huge fan of their red curry! It was really flavorful and one of the best red curries I have ever had! I also tried panang curry for the first time, and it was good but not necessarily my cup of tea. The workers were all very nice and accommodating, as they offered many times to take it off our tab. The pad see ew was also really good.   This is definitely a hole in the wall but one of the best Thai places I've been to! Hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! The food here is FANTASTIC! We took a chance stopping in this tiny little house-looking restaurant in a very seedy looking neighborhood because of the high Yelp ratings, and it is now my favorite Asian restaurant in AZ. My husband and I love the red curry and coconut dish, the drunken noodles, the fried tofu, and the iced Thai tea (AMAZING!!!) The Pad Thai was just OK, not much flavor or spice, but everything else we have tried has been amazing. The Chanpen was chosen \"Best Asian\" restaurant a year or so ago, and I can definitely see why. Put your blinders on to the neighborhood and the un-fancy decor inside, and just focus on the food. If I could have given 6 stars I would have."}
{"text":"First time here. Don't be fooled by the little old building. Food is wonderful. Great variety. Servers friendly. Will definitely come again next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food, amazingly authentic Thai. The staff is very friendly and wonderful service. Reasonably priced for the quality received."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Hate to be the 5-star Debbie Downer, but I can't justify giving this place 5 stars, or even 4.5.  Based upon our experience I'm even a little leery with a full 4 stars but I'll keep it there, based upon great, friendly service and complimentary ice cream to finish.  A nice touch.  So why not 5 stars?  I can't say this place comes even close to the best Thai I've ever had in the country and arguably, not even in the Valley.  (See Yupha's Thai Kitchen.)  My wife and I ordered the papaya salad (2 spiciness), pad thai and massaman curry (3 spiciness).  The papaya salad was quite good and despite the 2, pretty spicy.  Not the best (that was in Vegas), but good.  The massaman curry was also tasty, but given the 3 spiciness, was hoping for a little more heat.  But the curry was well balanced, nice and rich, plenty of meat.  The pad thai was what fell so short.  Overpoweringly sweet, not enough tamarind or heat to balance it out.  Had the meal been based on the pad thai alone, this would have been a 2.5 to 3-star rating.  But everything else we had was tasty and out in a flash.  Bonus points for portions - they are generous here, so the value is excellent.  I suspect, though, that the mass of 5-star reviews comes from the effect of a skewed population sample, a lowering of expectations.  This hole-in-the-wall looks terrible, in one of the worse neighborhoods of Phoenix.  With the very above-average food coming out of here, I think it gets the bump of beaten expectation.  Again, this place is good and we'll be back, but it is not the best Thai in the State, and lags far behind the best Thai in the country."}
{"text":"While the service is not the best, this is excellent Thai food. The Larb was fresh and flavorful, the Penang curry was well spiced and thick (not easy to find). I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. A little too small so it is kinda hard to find enough seats for a big group, but the food is amazing. The curry is super good. The Pad Thai is also a must-have"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This Thai place was amazing. The service is quiet (very much to themselves) yet very friendly when around you. The food was great everyone loved it. Side note: 5 was too spicy yet 3 is not spicy enough"}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations based on recommendations and 4.5 out of 5   star over all Yelp score.. Unfortunately it was not a 4.5 star experience.   I drove past the place 2 times because it turns out it's a beat up shack in a sort of run down area, so it blended in. I try to not judge a book by its cover, plus again there must have been a reason they were highly rated.  When I walked in it had 6 seats and it seemed very dirty inside, almost uncomfortably dirty. The service was polite but seemed pretty chaotic, I didn't know if I ordered at the counter, or to be seated or what to do.   When I took a seat a guy came and made a recommendation for the lunch special which actually saved me money so that was a plus.   Vegetarian Pad Thai noodles with veggies, and Tofu, an egg roll, and fried won tons.  I got the food in a timely manner which also was a plus because I was on a lunch break.  When I got my food the portion seemed a bit small. The Egg Roll was literally no joke the size of my pinky finger and it came with 3 Won Ton chips. The Pad Thai had WAY too much sauce, and the sauce was a too over bearing and too sweet. It had 2 pieces of Brocoli, 3 pieces of Tofu, and some Bean Sprouts. The pad Thai did not seem cooked through either it was too rubbery.   Maybe it's the taste of their Meat that has landed them a \"Best of Phoenix\" award but I couldn't back it. I was uncomfortable the entire time with how dirty it was and ultimately lost my appetite and didn't finish my food. Needless to say I won't be returning unfortunately."}
{"text":"I love how vegetarian friendly this place is! I've noticed that a lot of hole in the wall Asian food places are not veg friendly at all! This place has vegetarian egg roll and complimentary soup! I ordered the tofu pad Thai at a level 3. It was amazing. Do your soul and tummy a favor and give this place a go. ;)"}
{"text":"Chanpen is as close to the streets of  Bangkok you will get without leaving Phoenix... the food  took me down memory lane of my recent vacation to Thailand... the exotic flavors, aromas, spices, and taste....Pad Thai,  Chicken Curry, and fried banana dessert. WOW this place is great!!! It is Authentic, genuine, and is run by friendly-happy people!  Yes, I will be a return customer!!!"}
{"text":"This really is a hidden jewel.  I love finding new \"go-to\" places on vacation and this will be on our list from now on. The appetizers were very good.  I loved the crab puffs, satay and pot stickers.  Crisp fried perfectly.  Coconut soup was spicy and would be great for a cool night. Masaman curry was as good as I have had.  The fried tofu was a little large for me, but that's a small preference thing. Very good service, which is a big thing.  Try it, it really is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I have ever eaten at. Delicious and affordable. And it's near the airport. If you are staying near Skyharbor you owe it to yourself to try it. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"I'll start with the plus, fast service and attentive host.  That being  said the mens bathroom lacks privacy as the urinal and toilet are side ny side and no partition couldn't remember if the door was lockable.  They have a boiler in the corner that had a partition around it so when I walked in it was like a sauna and no paper towels in the dispenser. Those are cheap items so was it lack of attention or $.  When sitting down we looked around and the floor was pretty dirty we sat by the So.window table so just along the wall looked like it hadn't been swept for awhile. Now for the food. The tomatoes were over cooked and the vegs were pre packaged. When you see pre scalloped shaped carrots that's from a machine.Now for the lunch itself the Drunken Noodles were so so texture but it was over sauced too wet with sauce and too much sodium.  Less is more in this case.  It was sauced like a typical $ chinese food dish which shouldn't be in a Thai dish. All in all $ wise maybe OK but overall I won't be coming back.  So it's basic standard fare."}
{"text":"I was, indeed, hesitant when looking at the exterior of this place and no customers.  So glad we decided to go ahead and see if the Yelp reviews were right.  Best Thai food I have EVER had.  The 3 on the 0-5 spice level was perfect for our Pad Thai with shrimp/chicken.  The Crab Puffs were fresh and just melt-in-the-mouth goodness.  Also loved the flavors in the Won Ton Soup.  Service was EXCELLENT and she brought us free fried bananas for desert when she found out it was our first time.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've lived down the street for 5 years and never knew about this place!  You would never notice it just driving by- but I'm so glad I found it after searching for \"Thai\" close by in Yelp.  Pad Thai is very tasty.  Tiny little mom and pop shop but I definitely will be doing a lot of take out from them in the future!    Great lunch specials, too."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST ASIAN FOOD! I get the spicy crispy chicken with out cabbage. And let me tell you if you like spicy food this is the place I get level 4! The flavor of the food is incredible all cook to order! So fresh! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Had the red curry and lemongrass soup. Both were absolutely amazing! The staff was so nice and accommodating. The complimentary ice cream was the cherry on top!!"}
{"text":"Grimy and divey AF, but the food is on point. Family owned and operated, the ambiance is super casual, even if a bit run down n dirty. Make no doubt about it, the food is definitely authentic Thai. I ordered the Panang curry, which was wonderfully rich and deep in flavor, and loaded with Thai chili (upon request) just how I like it. The food came quick, and the service was friendly. They even gave me a complimentary fried banana for dessert. A great place to stop for a quick authentic Thai meal. Currently cash only, so stop at the ATM beforehand."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place and it was one of the best thai food's ever. It was not like fast food types. They took care of each food they served. They served the best thai ice tea and their green curry with vegetables was just so creamy and amazing! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I attend the university across the street and we go here at least weekly! #sogood"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall my ass. Honestly, their food is not that great. At least the red curry isn't. Don't understand why is it called red curry. The color is yellow. I got a fly bothering me the whole time. Filthy place."}
{"text":"I love Chanpen. The people are the best. The food is delicious. I have had nothing but perfect experiences here. Going to be returning for a very long time. Chanpen, keep up the amazing service. You guys are absolutely incredible. You set the standard!"}
{"text":"Craving for some Thai food and I took the day off from work to run errands and get some shopping done. We came in during lunch hour and the crowd wasn't too bad but you can tell everyone was on their lunch break since they were dress in business attire and had their work badges on.   We order the drunken noodle, pad see ew and Thai coffee. We originally tried ordering appetizers like the stuff chicken wings but they were out and then the Thai toast but they said it will take 30mins to make! So never mind appetizers. The pad see ew was too sweet but the drunken noodle was perfect. We got the spice level 3 and that was pretty spicy.   We ended up ordering desert the sticky rice and mango which this is probably the second time I've ever had it and this one was ok."}
{"text":"Talk about a \"hole in the wall\"! This tiny, unassuming place is fabulous! Service was quick and friendly and the food -- it dances on your tongue! We have had Thai food in many places around the country and this little gem is our #2 choice overall, but #1 in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty. Good value. Had the lemon grass soup. Highly recommended. The pot stickers came out hot and crispy. Very good"}
{"text":"I'm not a Thai food expert, but everything was delicious.   Each dish was so different and flavorful.   Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food.  The Tom-Ka has lots of ingredients in it. I order the Pad-See Yew with pork with five star spice and it tastes so good. Nice portion.  Our group also ordered Spicy noodle and royal curry, both of those dishes are delicious with nice presentation and portion as well.  Will def come back!"}
{"text":"When i first found this spot and went in to pick up a carry out I thought oh my goodness this place is a dive, but do not let that fool you, this hole in the wall has the best Thai food!! There are only 4 or 5 tables inside and last time it was packed with a wait. Both the red and yellow curry shrimp are fabulous, nice size shrimp that are sweet and of high quality, and medium heat is the perfect amount of burn. Prices are so reasonable for the quantity of food you get. Highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. The staff is friendly and willing to assist in anyway. I came in for a takeout order. The restaurant itself is modern and chic despite its location in a strip mall. The food is delicious and comes in ample portions. I am a local who came in for the first time. I will be coming back as often as I can. I am sure the food will spur my cravings more often. Definitely a must try for locals or those just passing through."}
{"text":"The very definition of hole in the wall.  If you haven't come to this easy to miss place, you should get off yelp and go right now.  You can't beat the price, the food, or the...um...anything else.  Even with the table of screaming obnoxious children being babysat by cellphone renditions of that damn frozen song over and over and over, I would still come back every day I could.  I try something different each time  and each time I have a new favorite. Stop reading!  Go man, go."}
{"text":"Delicious! We were getting really sick of eating nasty, processed fast food in the endless strip mall that is Phoenix. This family-owned restaurant was cozy and decorated nicely, with friendly service, and best of all, fresh, homecooked, curries, tofu, appetizers and salads.  The panang curry was bomb, especially."}
{"text":"I just are here with my parents and we were a little worried when we got there. From the outside it looked small at a little sketchy. The B health code rating didn't help.   Do not be fooled by the external appearance,  the food here was great. Seriously the best drunken noodles I have ever had in my life.  Portions were good too. The only minor thing was I ordered a 5/5 for spiciness and it wasn't as hot as I expected.  My parents were happy too.    Our waitress was extremely pleasant and gave us a free bowl of ice cream!  I can't wait to come come back!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice location, really really good food, and free ice cream at the end of the meal. Downloaded the Yelp app just to rate this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try this on a whim, had the Pad Thai and was hooked. Just wish the spiciest was a bit spicier, though, I can see why it isn't on a flat level.   The Curry Chicken is amazing as well and has the amount of spice I love. Rice is bomb too.  Workers are either really nice and helpful or real akward."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! I ordered the Pad-Thai with chicken and shrimp. The noodles were cooked to perfection, the spices and aroma was out of this world. The only thing I would change is more meat. I got two pieces of shrimp and a very small portion of chicken.   I also, ordered the crab puffs which I wasn't impressed. The filling flavor was there but the actually shell was over cooked and burnt. It was almost as if you were biting into Hardtack cracker. Not the most enjoyable thing to eat but it's there if your starving to death.   Overall, the experience was great and would recommend eating here. I giving this place 4 stars for less meat and burnt crab puffs."}
{"text":"So impressed!  I ordered take out and they said 15 minutes on my order over the phone. I showed up in 10 minutes and I knew I was early. They gave me a bottle water as I waited 3 minutes for my food. When I got home my food was hot and oh so good. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Is this place small, yes? Is there bird poop outside, probably! WHO CARES?! This place is out of this world!!! First of all, the customer service is OUTSTANDING! The Thai Coffee and Coconut soup are to die for - The Pad Thai is absolutely delicious! You need to go here and seriously order one of everything! Don't listen to the petty reviews. Just go here and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best curry I have ever had. Green, red and avocado curry. Their lunch menu is quick and the best. Causal, mom and pop ambiance. It's rarely ever to packed, I have always got quick seating. They have a few good Thia beers as well."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is delish! Also recommend the yellow curry and chicken fried rice and everything else lol you honestly can't go wrong with your choice here everything is so good! I love that they give complimentary soup to start with and coconut ice cream at the end that's fresh made in house! The customer service is always on point"}
{"text":"This place is so authentic and delicious. Best hole in the wall Thai and they give you free ice cream at the end..... Heaven is real ~"}
{"text":"Decided to try this based on the amazing reviews.  I'm not sure if what we experienced was just an off day (I dont think it was) or what.  Ordered take out.  45 minute wait.  I thought that was a good sign, they are in demand. Got the food.  We ordered 2 of the lunch specials. Neither of us got our soup and my spouse didn't get the egg roll.  Food was NOT stellar.  It was ok, similar to what you get at a mall food court.  It was surprising to me that it was just ok, I was expecting really good based on reviews."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  The food is priced just right.  Sure it is $10 for a meal, but it is enough to feed two and still have left overs. The desert banana with green tea ice cream is delicious!  Best desert I have had in a long time. Did a repeat visit, and tried the noodle soup.  It was really good.  I will say it's on the pricey side compared to some other Thai restaurant's in the valley. But you do get a bit more food so it balances out."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great flavors. Small and cramped but worth it. The service was wonderful and made me feel so welcomed. Choose from 1-5 heat and although I love hot and spicy my tolerance could only handle 2. I love calling in my order and picking up dinner on the way home. Generous portions go a long way. Love it here."}
{"text":"Good Thai food for a good price. I have been there two times in the span of two days because the food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the service is good. We tried the standards: Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Royal Curry. All were delicious. As with all Thai food, be careful on the spice level you choose. You get to choose from 0-5. I first tried 1. It was good, but personally, I like a lot more spice so I added chili sauce to it. The next time, I ordered 3. Perfect. Spicy enough to have you mouth breathing and drinking water between bites, but not so spicy that you can't enjoy the flavor.  When in doubt, choose a low number and add spice as needed. The lunch special is a good deal; cheap for Thai food. The employees are really nice. They gave us complimentary green tea ice cream on my first visit. When I ordered takeout for lunch the second time, they brought me water and soup while I waited. I'm actually going back for lunch right now.  LOL!!  Oh. I didn't give five stars because it's not the best Thai food I've had. But the price, service and quality is good enough to keep going back."}
{"text":"Pretty bad.  Super ghetto building, very ghetto location in general, the food was average at best for someone who knows Thai food.  Also how can you possibly have air conditioning not working and still be open in the summertime Phoenix? That just makes the meal miserable!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased to learn that Chanpen opened a new location 4 weeks ago and it is larger to accommodate more people with the same great quality of food.   The location is in the Fry's Food plaza, on the northeast corner of 48th Street and Baseline in Tempe. The atmosphere is open and clean, with more tables to accommodate parties small and large.   I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special for $7.95 and it came with soup, a veggie eggroll and a wonton crisp. It was, as expected, extremely good.   The staff is very nice and I had a chance to chat with one of the co-owners. All in all I hope that this place succeeds because it has the best Thai food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is has delicious food! We ordered the fresh rolls, yellow curry and pad thai. Complimentary green tea ice cream w/ chocolate sauce drizzle. Even brought my toddler a lollipop.   The dishes were all very flavorful and delicious. Dine in is not for big parties, because this place is small - 2 booths that seat 4 and a few small tables. They do offer takeout though.   I just finished my leftovers and want to go back!  **update 7/2015** there is a second location that is larger with the same quality of food and service. Northeast corner of 48th street and Baseline in Tempe, in the Fry's Food plaza."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that doesn't look too appealing on the outside. Inside you're greeted with a quaint dining area and friendly staff.   We ordered take-out and was pleasantly surprised by a free bottle of water when picking up the good. Our dinner consisted of the Beef Salad, Rad Nar, and Pad Thai.   The beef salad had good flavor with a hefty serving of veggies such as lettuce and cucumbers but I thought the beef was a bit dry. The Rad Nar had very good flavor but I was a bit disappointed that I got normal broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli. Also the sauce was a bit too thick. The Pad Thai was very good. One of the few Pad Thai I actually liked at Thai restaurants around the valley.   Took off a star for the Rad Nar sauce being a little too thick. Will definitely come back to dine again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with a lot of spice and flavor! Their yellow curry is amazing and so is their red curry! One of my absolute favorite places to grab lunch, and their lunch prices are way affordable... Much less than a gross and greasy fast food combo meal!"}
{"text":"I just had to drop in and write a review about this fabulous little place! I drive by Chanpen Thai daily since it is so close to work. Looks a little run down from the outside but do not let that fool you! The inside is small, warm and inviting. The customer service is outstanding! I ordered my meal to go and received a free water bottle. The gentlemen even helped me out since my hands were full. The food is delicious! I ordered the drunken noodles #2 on the spice scale and it is perfect. The lunch portion was easy on the wallet and just enough to satisfy. Thank you Chanpen for a wonderful experience I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Had one night in Phoenix, my friend picked me up for a quick dinner decided for this Thai spot.  My first search option is always brown rice when I am on the road since I believe restaurants that offer brown rice usually are healthier options.  Ordered a coconut seafood soup, pad-thai chicken and a curry, served with brown rice it was under $40.  huge portions and the food was really good.  Staff is really friendly and they serve free green tea ice cream in the end.    Sadly not sure when I will be in Phoenix again, also the inside is nothing luxury probably not a great place for a first date, but if you are in the area flying solo or with friends, for sure to give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I stop here for lunch as often as possible.  Their lunch menu is affordable and delicious.  Try the red curry.  Spicy 1-5, 2 is just right for me."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have had since moving to Phoenix. I have lived in San Diego and Los Angeles before recently moving here and I was really hoping to find a Thai restaurant that reminded me of Home. Very happy I found this place! Great tasting Penang Curry!"}
{"text":"I live in LA and lived in the Bay Area before that, and this is probably the best Thai food I've ever had, so that's saying a lot. I had the pineapple fried rice and it was massive and an excellent choice. The pineapple was not canned. I also got the mas-sa mun curry with chicken. I'd never had it but it was amazing and they give you a good portion of white rice with it. My friends had the Thai iced tea and they thought it was amazing too. They speak English in the kitchen though they have Thai blood. Despite that, it's still possibly the best Thai I've had.   The only thing to be aware of is this place is pretty small. We were lucky to get a table as a big group. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it makes up for that for what's on the inside!"}
{"text":"In short - amazing food, excellent menu options and a clean establishment.   Now for the details.   The food here is probably the best thai food I've had in the valley. It is full of flavor and spice, delivering satisfaction with every bite. They did justice on my favorite thai dish - pad see ew. The noodles were soft, the beef was tender, and the broccoli and carrots added a nice touch of crunch and freshness. Be careful on the spice factor here though. It is rated 1-5 and I went with my usual order of 3/5; it is noticeably spicier than similar spice ratings at other Thai restaurants.   The only reason this place didn't receive 5 stars was because the service could have been better, especially since it was not very busy while I was dining. The servers were very polite but didn't seem too attentive. It wasn't completely terrible service but our group did have to flag the server down a time or two.   Be sure to try to come at lunch time during the week as they have many great lunch special options. This place is sure to please newcomers to Thai food as well as experienced foodies."}
{"text":"I have no words for them .... fantastic food .... I ordered egg rolls those  were so delicious.... Even the main course was superb .... I would definitely recommend anyone to visit this place ...."}
{"text":"Best thai food I have had in Phoenix Metro. Probably the best pad thai I have ever had.   The Good:  - Food. It is simply amazing. - Portions are very generous. - Service is great. Very attentive and friendly. They always offer complimentary ice-cream.  The Bad:  - Not the prettiest place in a not very nice neighborhood."}
{"text":"Quality Thai food at a mid-ranged price! The Panang Curry beef I ordered was absolutely delicious. The balance between the spices, coconut milk, and peanut sauce was on point rendering the sauce's viscosity to absolute perfection. Service was also excellent. The waitresses were constantly making sure our water was filled and that the food was alright. I never felt the need to track the waiters down. All in all, an excellent food establishment! Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Picked up takeout order tonight. I had the Drunken noodles with Chicken, and the egg rolls. Both dishes were very tasty, and the person taking my order was friendly. I'll definitely try some other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"I found this Thai place while I was grocery shopping. The staff was very friendly, which is rare for most Asian restaurants. We ordered fried rice, pad thai noodles, and curry. The food came out fast and was delicious! I'm definitely going here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Had the chicken satay appetizer and Panang curry and sweet and sour with chicken. Both entrees were very very good and the service was very friendly and efficient. Prices are very reasonable considering the amount of food served. Our bill came to $ 32.61 before gratuity. In addition, they offered us complimentary green tea ice cream which was a nice ending to our meal. Thank you Chanpen Thai for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Really good food. From Denver but would come here again if in town. Hope they have many years of success. They are a breath of fresh air from all the more timid food stylings I've come across in Phoenix. They do spicy right."}
{"text":"The staff was engaging, warm and friendly. They gave us excellent suggestions and explained the creative and interesting specials which included Avocado Green Curry and a Pumpkin Seed Curry.  Everything we ordered was amazing.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Inconspicuous building, excellent Thai food. Be ready for the heat if you order 5. I usually get 3 on the heat scale."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. They are so nice and the food is amazing! Panang Curry is a must! This is my favorite takeout spot."}
{"text":"Summary: sub par Thai food,I've had much better but there seems to be slim pickings in the area so if you have a craving go here and get the Tom yum. If you're into pad Thai that is quite wet then it'll be right up your alley.  Came here on Christmas Eve for dinner and it was pretty full and they had a decent amount of people getting take out. Parking was easy since it's in a strip mall like area. The waitress was hard to communicate with she didn't listen well especially for the fact that English was her second language. Note: English isn't my parents first language so we're quite used to this, but it was difficult for us. Tried the following dishes and nothing was memorable: fried rice, sate, pad see ew, pad thai your typical Thai staples. I've had so much better in Cincinnati, Columbus, and Milwaukee and these are large cities.  The only thing that was good was the Tom yum soup. Good variety of elements as well as a solid heat and sourness that I love."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not my favorite green curry, but good. It was a bit sweeter than I normally like. Spicy noodles were a hit. Overall a decent meal. Liked the ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"Don't let the looks of the place deceive you. The food is amazing. Some of the best Thai food ever. I had the Veggie Pad Thai and it was fantastic. The portion was perfect and the service is great. The place is very clean and is worth the wait if there is one."}
{"text":"Quality, full of flavor and affordable.  Our experience here was great.  The customer service was excellent and they treated us geeat. The food was as traditional as it gets. It was full of flavor and the menu had excellent choices.  The items were reasonably priced and the quality was great for what you pay. The thai iced tea was delicious and refreshing. We also got the tom yum soup, it was absolutely delicious.  We got the pineapple fried rice, panang curry and drunken noodles. We will definitely make this a regular for us."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mixed Seafood Hot-Pot soup, Pad Thai, and the Pa-Nang Curry. The soup was alright, but the Pad Thai and curry were so yummy! The staff was so nice and even gave us complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of our meal. I highly recommend eating here if you want great Thai food!"}
{"text":"This place had great reviews and I wanted something new to try. I found it without a problem. It's a really small place, but it smelled amazing when I got out the car. The guys were really nice and helpful with making recommendations on what to try.   I ordered the chicken pot stickers, drunken shrimp noodles, and royal curry with beef. PHENOMENAL!! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I'm typically the one finding the places to eat with friends - it's no different with colleagues. A bunch of us were on a business trip in Phoenix and needed a place to lunch.   I pulled out my trusty Yelp iPhone app and saw that there was a 4.5 star rated Thai place less than a mile away - how had we missed it until now?  As we drove towards it, the surroundings shifted - a sensation I've experienced many times growing up in LA. Yes my friends, we were entering the ghetto. Key indicators included:  * disproportionally high number of check cashing/liquor stores per capita * excessively sagging guy at bus stop * slow moving angry looking guy on bicycle  We passed Chanpen on the first go-around - it was tiny and rickety. We u-turned and parked. Looking at the place, I couldn't imagine fitting a full sized commercial kitchen inside, let alone places to sit and eat.  I started to second guess myself - where had I brought my colleagues? I looked up, thinking of the 4.5 star rating, and the 5-star elite member reviews - I walked confidently towards the door with Yelpy resolve.   When we got inside, it became clear that large parties didn't frequent Chanpen (I think they do a large volume of their business by delivery). It took tetris like skill for the waitress to get some tables arranged so all 7 of us could sit together.   I ordered the red curry lunch special, with fried tofu and brown rice ($6.50).   While I waited, I had a hot tea - it came in the largest tea mug in history, and tasted like warm Thai tea nix the sugar and condensed milk. I henceforth dubbed it the \"skinny thai tea.\" It was awesome.   When the food came, we were all impressed, it looked very fresh and well presented. But man oh man, when I tasted my first bite of red curry tofu and brown rice, I nearly traveled to another world. The food was so light it almost floated, but somehow the flavors were so rich and balanced I could get lost in them. Everything was so fresh I swore they grew it out back.   I was shocked, but it all started to come together - 4.5 stars on yelp for a slanty shanty mid-ghetto? Yes... yes absolutely. I've eaten at a lot of Thai places - this may be the best yet.  The service was also superb - super warm and friendly.   I will come here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We call it \"The Carolinas of Thai\" From the outside it looks a bit shady just like Carolinas Mexican Food downtown but once you take that first bite, you feel like you've struck gold. Although I never had \"authentic\" Thai food in Thailand, I can only imagine it would taste this good. Everything tastes fresh and the complementary dessert is just the icing on the cake. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food with good service. The decor was nice. Enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp, pad thai and stir-fry silver noodles. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Super delicious food and great service to.  I ordered the yellow curry and we topped off the meal with the coconut ice cream....will definitely be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Small place. Definitely underrated. I looked around and could not decided. Everything looked and smelled great. I had drunken noodles. Outstanding flavor"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from here pretty often, and I come in for dinner service whenever I get the itch for thai food. The servers are really nice and attentive, the food is great, portions are huge, and the booths are large and comfy."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I came here today with a friend who is also adventurous and likes to try authentic hole in the wall, non-chain local restaurants. We split a curry dish, pad thai with chicken and shrimp, and crab blossoms. We both enjoyed everything, and the hot level of spice was just right for both of us. We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here ever since they open this second location. The owner is very nice and attentive. If you're looking for real authentic Thai food look no further.  I've literally have tried every single thing on their menu and everything is so delicious. Their lunch special are so reasonable in pricing and portion size. You have to try it for yourself and you'll be hooked. If I could I'd give it 6 stars. Best Asian food ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We had yellow curry and #37 (can't remember the name) ice tea was fantastic and although they do not sell it, waitress sent me with a to go cup! Also gave us complimentary dessert-fried bananas were delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on yelp, but I have to write for them because their food is so delicious. Plus, they brought the coconut ice cream after the meal so it's a bonus."}
{"text":"Was very satisfied with my Coconut Curry Chicken.  Very flavourful and the portion was generous.  Of course, I ordered a Thai Iced Tea as well.  From the outside this place looks like a little hole-in-the wall but there is more than meets the eye once you enter.  Service was courteous and  my food was ready in about 10 minutes.  Will definitely try different items on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, we enjoyed this restaurant so much! We came here for dinner with our toddler who is quite a handful, and it was awesome! I was a little put off by the location and it can be easy to miss when you drive by, but I'm so glad we trusted the reviews and came.   We ordered pot stickers for the kid, and they brought him out an egg roll too. He decided soy sauce was his be favorite flavor and so he ate a ton of their rice too. The rice was the best too, just sticky enough and not dry. The pot stickers came with an incredible sauce I couldn't get enough of! And I ate half the egg roll and it was the best I've ever had.  We ordered curry and pad Thai. The pad Thai I ate was flavorful and sweet, definitely my favorite pad Thai I've ever had. The spice really caught up to be though which surprised me because it was only level 2. And my husband devoured his curry and loved it."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that this restaurant has a new and larger location.   I frequently went to the old one, and I loved the food - but the place was just too small.   The same people work at the new location and the food is still amazing. The red curry is fantastic, and when you ask for \"hot\" it will be flaming hot. Like it should be.   Little things about this place: they give you bottled water when you're waiting for a pick up order, they'll patiently explain what Thai food is to people who don't know, and the atmosphere is beautiful.  In short, if you like Thai food or good stuff in general - go here."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave reviews, but man.... My company moved about 2 minutes away so I found this place and gave it a shot for lunch. All I can say is WOW! This place is awesome - great, friendly service, food (got the Pad Thai with Shrimp and Chicken lunch special) is AWESOME. Couldn't beat the price for the level of service and quality of food they have. Heck, I was about to walk out after picking up my order and they handed me a free water bottle because it was hot outside. Totally coming here for lunch A LOT. Definitely going to try out the rest of the menu. :) SOOO GOOD"}
{"text":"I'll try to be super positive here and give it 3 stars. When I found a restaurant with 5 stars reviews and its one of my favorite cuisines, i expect something phenomenal, but i found it just ok. I ordered one seafood coconut soup and beef panang, despite the fancy look, the soup was ok, and i found a piece of pork inside it and i dont eat pork at all. The beef panang was below average, i feel more tomatoes soup than the panang curry and i ordered it level 4, so it was supposed to be super spicy , the actual spicy level i tasted was 2. The staff are very nice and kind though. Conclusion, the food is just ok or below average despite the good fancy look."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. We had Pad Thai and Crispy Chicken. Both were incredible. Flavors were great and we got level 3 spicy."}
{"text":"The food - we had pad Thai, pad see yew, and coconut ice cream- was delicious and large serving size. Even if the food wasn't amazing, the service alone would make me give this place five stars. Kindest, most generous waiter I've ever met! Went above and beyond expectations!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  I've eaten here 3 times now and each time has been better than the last!  Very friendly  wait staff.  I was not a big fan of Thai cuisine before being dragged here by some friends.  Two guys can eat a big lunch for around $20.  You can order your spice level 1-5.  I've had level 4 and it was like being maced!  I stick to level 3 or under!  Pad Thai is great as is the pad Thai curry with rice."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent! We shared the chicken, shrimp, and glass noodle soup. The soup was presented nicely, flame and all. The chicken was tender nicely sliced, shrimp was plump and clean. All the vegetables were fresh. The stock was so wonderfully seasoned. We also had the sweet and sour chicken. It was not the overly battered fried junk. It was lightly coated, sauted, and finished in a wonderful sauce accompanied by fresh cubed pineapple. They provided complimentary orange sherbert after the entrees - nicely done but we went for the coconut icecream served with a side of crushed peanuts and chocolate sauce to drizzle. Did I mention they start you with refreshing cucumber water?  What a find! We normally would drive right into Tempe or Chandler. This place will be a future destination for sure. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh Chanpen, I didn't think I could like you anymore than I already did until I came to your new location! I met a couple friends here and omg this location is nice! The old location was fine, especially because it held the delish food inside, but this nondescript location in a strip mall was super clean looking and nicely decorated. The food was just as good as at the original location, with their main triumph (in my opinion) being that they actually make their food spicy when you ask them to. Seems like not a big deal, but, in Phoenix, they're the only ones who do this. I got the drunken noodles and thai tea.... both delicious, both huge - I had a ton of leftovers. We all got treated to complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of the meal.... this stuff was out of this world good. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I want to come back here. Immediately. Right now. I just had it for lunch. This place was surprisingly awesome. Did I mention I want to come back? Well, anyway, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little worried. This place is small... aaand not so squeaky clean.... aaand kind of on the old side, BUT do not be deterred. The food was legit. More legit than anywhere else I have had in Phoenix. The lunch special was a steal at 6.50$ and coming with soup, entree, spring roll, fried crispy wonton things, and rice (if you don't have noodles). The soup was delicious, a slightly spicy lemongrass flavored soup with fresh veg inside. For my entree, I had the drunken noodles and they were the most flavorful drunken noodles I have had in town. I often complain that my noodles are too dry, not so here. The noodles had tons of fresh veggies (broccoli, onion, carrots, basil, bell peppers, etc) that were cooked perfectly. I would go back for that dish, but I also would like to try their curry... it looks great. This place has serious five star potential. Will be making a return appearance soon!   PS Like others have mentioned, seating is limited, so we had to wait a bit for a table, but the wait was totally worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I came into this place for lunch and I was really impressed. The food was really good, the Thai iced coffee was off the hook and the staff was really attentive. Even their music selection was on point. Being from NYC and eating at so many Thai restaurants, I think this place can really hold its own."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after an event and I must say, the food was amazing. The place itself is small and there's nothing fancy about it but it's all about the food. They do have another location in Tempe if you want a little class with your meal.   We ordered fish cakes which were really good and I had the pineapple fried rice and my wife had the pad Thai. Both were delish but the only reason they got 4 out of 5 stars was that the pad Thai took long to come out. If you're looking for great authentic Thai food, come to this spot!"}
{"text":"3 stars for service. Food is actually 5 stars. We drove from Gilbert to have lunch here.  Q"}
{"text":"Food and service was ok...I would just ask that they would clean off the pigeon poop at the front door and in the lighting fixtures... lost my appetite..but with good company a good service my overall all experience wasn't a total bust..."}
{"text":"Wow! The meal started off great with the chai nonsweeten ice tea. From there it only got better! I had silver noodle soup - and the chicken curry drunken noodles. They serve green tea ice cream as a pleasant surprise, no extra charge."}
{"text":"Want to add that the Panang curry is AWESOME.  I am so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I am from CA and was just visiting Arizona, I checked Yelp, looking for some Thai food and this place had good reviews The outward appearance was scary but I thought let's just go for it Delicious, super hot food, fresh and yummy They give large portion and we had good food for the following day Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great find.  Authentic Thai food with soup dishes that were unique among American Thai restaurants.  Attentive service.  Good value.  I will go again."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome lunch specials. A family run place. Looks run down but the food is spot on. Red Curry is solid."}
{"text":"I had a delicious, delightful meal today. The food was different but very tasty. Nice change from usual American restaurants. Young servers were pleasant and friendly. I would give this maximum stars"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in town! The most authentic Thai food I've been able to find in the greater Phoenix area. My favorite dishes are the chicken pad Thai and the pineapple red curry! They are quick and delicious! If you dine in they give you complimentary green tea ice cream, which is a nice little dessert for the sweet tooth. If you order take out try give free bottles of water. Definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The most amazing yellow curry chicken I have ever had.  I like the fact that you can pick your level of hotness.  I have to say this is the best I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went to Chanpen Thai Cuisine for lunch today to meetup with a contact.  The food is good.  It is a hole-in-the-wall.  It appears to be a good place for a quick lunch.  I had the glass noodle salad.  My contact, another engineer, had a yellow curry.    The service is prompt.  The place is busy.  Yes, parking can be a PITA.  It is a low overhead place."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  Wonderful food, pad Thai, green curry and coconut soup were wonderful.  Outstanding service and huge amount of food for very little money!  I will be back when I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have previously given a sterling review to the other location of chanpen thai on Broadway.  My understanding is that both locations are owned and operated by different family members.  I will say the neighborhood and the interior decor at this location are far superior. While the service at broadway was exemplary (complimentary ice cream and bottled water while I waited for my order to be filled as an example), on baseline I have found it to be indifferent. Thus, i wanted to post regarding my experience three days ago.  My complaints are that I had asked for plastic silverware on my to go order as I am staying in a hotel, but this was forgotten. Second, when I ordered, I was not asked how spicy I wanted my pineapple green curry. I normally order 3, but I think the cashier assumed I was not an experienced thai food eater and requested a 1.  The food was delicious, but could have been better with a small customer service effort. Also kind of strange that after I ordered, I stood by the counter for maybe 10 min while they prepped my food and none of the maybe 6 people who approached smiled or acknowledged my presence. Some small and simple customer service tweaks would go a long way. Good restaurant but make the drive to broadway if you want to be wowed."}
{"text":"I found this little hole in wall place on business travel. Accommodations are tight but the food is some of the best I have had for the price. I have been back three times this week!  The pad thai and curries are authentic. Try the pumpkin curry, a treat.  Prices are phenomenal  and I love bottle of water and coconut ice cream they provide while you wait for your take out.  Near the airport so no excuse for business travelers to miss this local gem"}
{"text":"I've always liked hole in the wall type places with great food and chanpen didn't disappoint. It may not look like much on the outside but I enjoyed every moment of my first experience at chanpen today. Every bite and every bit of service was exceptional for the price (6.50 lunch special). It's the best Thai I've had in AZ and I'm already looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"I decided to stop here and order the Drunken Noodle dish on a referral.  WOW!  This is like a serious hole-in-the-wall.  I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  Anyway, I was well attended by the staff there and they were very efficient in getting the dish into the to-go box for me....and got myself some peanut sauce on the side (A must-have for any Thai dish)  Driving back to work, my entire car had the intoxicating smell of Drunken Noodle...I knew what I was getting myself into, but not to the fullest extent until I took my first bite.  I mix the peanut sauce into the spicy drunken noodle dish...it was seriously the best thing I could have ever consumed on a Wednesday!  Oh my goodness....time decided to stop during my lunch break because every bite was so orgasmic and I began to cherish every bite I took.  Thanks Chanpen for the best Wednesday afternoon of my entire life!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Try the Panang Curry. I'd swim in it if I could. Also, complimentary ice cream afterwards!"}
{"text":"Solid.   Food comes out faaaaaaaaaaast!!!  I was happy with my spicy eggplant with tofu and green papaya salad. Generous portions.   Not much for ambiance and didn't love wine selection (two flavors of Sutter Home in baby twist off bottles)."}
{"text":"I love trying pad Thai at new locations but I'm always hesitant that a new place won't be the same as my all time favorite (Wild Thaiger in Downtown Phoenix) Buuuttttt Chanpen is so delicious I can't decide between both. I came here twice in a week because it was that great! The coconut ice cream after your meal is a generous touch :) Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a nice surprise. The server was warm. I had the pad see yew and my fiance had pad thai.  I had a 2 out of 5 (on the heat scale) and that was just a titch hotter than I like. At another  Thai restaurant I could go up to a 4 without eradicating my tastebuds. So start low if you are \"heat sensitive\" like me. At the end of the meal, you get a yummy treat.  We enjoyed  our meals and will definitely  be back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What can I say... This place has my boyfriend and I coming back time after time! Never ever disappoints. Ever. It just keeps us wanting more. We usually do take out but decided to eat in this time. We got our usual favourites: chicken and shrimp PadThai and Massaman curry with both level 4 spicy. We once tried level 5 spicy and it's SPICY! This is coming from someone who loves very, very spicy food so order with caution. My boyfriend could not handle the level 5. Therefore we always go for the level 4. We also ordered the appetizer fish cakes and mango sticky rice for dessert. Everything was tasty and we even got ice cream included with our meal. Another must try when available is the crab fried rice. The owner is always there at the restaurant and is super friendly. Service was great and will keep coming back even though we have moved far away. Must try. You will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Service was polite and attentive.  Menu was informative, descriptive, and a variety of food options.    The scoring of spice, 0-5, was right on the mark.  Food was simple and fresh taste.    Small seating area that added to the atmosphere of cooked from scratch meals."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, I would love to give this place 4 stars because I love to support small local business, but this place wasn't quuuuite there yet for me.  It could also be that I didn't order the right things and possibly their other entrees are tastier.  We ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and the silver noodles stir fried with vegetables and shrimp.  What I love about Thai food is how flavorful the food is and that the flavors always have lots of depth, with lots of different spices, etc.  The flavors here fell a little flat for me.  The pineapple fried rice could have used more herbs and maybe basil or something, because it just had that yellow curry taste to me.  Same for the silver noodles, the flavor wasn't wonderful.  I will say they did give me a lot of shrimp, and the shrimp were really BIG!  The Thai tea also wasn't my favorite. There was too much cream and not enough tea.  I did appreciate the complimentary coconut icecream for dessert, that was a nice tough, although I am lactose intolerant so I only took a small nibble to be polite.  It tasted good though!  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like coconut ate his whole iceream portion.  The restaurant itself is so nice looking inside.  I love that they separated it out into two sections.  One section has these modern booths and the other side has regular tables. It'd be a nice place to host a large group (bc when we came on Saturday night there was only 1 other table).  I may come back here and try a different dish, but so far my other favorite Thai restaurants are preferred."}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall this Thai gem is a hidden treasure. Excellent service and wonderful food, this place has become a regular stop.  Fav dishes: any of the curries, seafood hot pot and the coconut soup Ask for mild, medium can usually be overly spicy."}
{"text":"Authentic cuisine.  Generally call in. Service is excellent.  If they make a mistake or take too long. They always apologize and make up for it. Food is very tasty"}
{"text":"We moved down here from the Northwest about 6 years ago and had not found truly great Thai food in Arizona... that is until tonight. A friend with good food taste said that we had to eat here, and we are so glad he did.  This is truly excellent Thai food and some of the best we've ever had. Additionally, the owners are the type of people you are glad to support as it is clear they thoroughly enjoy what they do -- not to mention they are great at it.  This is a very small, totally unpretentious, family-owned restaurant that is in what looks to be, a little converted house. Try their food once, and I'm betting you will be like us, and be heading back there as soon as possible.  Oh yeah... the coconut pineapple ice cream is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall. Place is tiny. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food I've found so far in the Phoenix area.  Their spice scale is a little more aggressive than most places (maybe they're more authentic?), so make sure to take that into account when ordering.  I'm a 2/5 fan here, and I do okay with spicy food.  My husband loves it when his eyes are watering, he's choking and his tongue is burning, and the 3/5 was good for him.  We had the green avocado curry (absolutely delicious - it was on the special menu that day) and a pineapple red curry.  I honestly don't think there's a curry dish you could get here that would be disappointing.  The free coconut ice cream at the end of the meal is the perfect touch.  I'll be back every time I'm in the area (and likely sometimes when I'm not)."}
{"text":"I liked the food. However, It was warm in the establisshment. Not good for summer dinning. UNless you do carry out."}
{"text":"FINALLY, AT LAST, Thai food in South Phoenix!  I agree with the other reviews -- this place is really outstanding!  It's a tiny little building randomly placed on Broadway, so it's very easy to miss.  But the food is the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix!  We had the Coconut Soup (Tom Kha Gai), Garlic Chicken, Drunken Noodles and Royal Curry with Chicken.  Everything was absolutely delicious and very, very fresh!   Chanpen is a GREAT addition to South Phoenix, and I hope it lasts!  I'll definitely be supporting it again."}
{"text":"Wow! What nice people! And good food with a spicy kick (upon request). Place isn't fancy or large but if you want something quick and tasty this is where to find it."}
{"text":"Good Thai, but I'm from California and am a bit spoiled with good Thai food. Not very hot, would probably make excellent take-out. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Oh man.. I usually like this place, but today, I only got two pieces of chicken in my curry.."}
{"text":"Great find for us in the neighborhood! We've tried their lunch special and dinner menu and they were both great. We had the spicy fried rice with chicken and pad thai with chicken and shrimp ( the waiter also explained to us that in Thailand, Pad Thai always comes with shrimp. Even if it's a piece or two)."}
{"text":"Love. I love this place. I hate hyping places up but this is the best Thai I've ever had.  Location: south Phoenix, in a small stand alone building that looks like a house. Ample parking. Not gorgeous from an architectural standpoint but interesting.  Ambiance: very simple inside. Decor is pretty cute. Honestly I liked inside - you can create your own ambiance depending on who you go with.  Service: very good. Everyone is friendly and attentive and my water glass never went empty.  Food: awesome. So fresh, so much great flavor. The pad Thai was so tasty, chicken wasn't dry by any means. Red curry was oozing with coconut milk goodness and basil and tofu. Chicken satay skewers were lightly spiced and juicy. Sticky rice with green tea ice cream was the perfect size and a wonderful end to a wonderful meal. Also loved the small container of super super spicy chilis on each table.  Price: very reasonable.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"pretty good food, authentic thai. sketchy location but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I eat an absurd amount of Thai food and have to say this is one of the best I've had in a while. I ordered the coconut soup (Tom kha kai) vegetarian style, drunken noodles with tofu, vegetarian pad thai and banana sticky rice. Everything blew my expectations away. The service was quick and friendly, prices are reasonable and portions are generous. Mod helped me out and he was helpful, not only with recommendations on food here, but other places to check out while I'm staying in Phoenix area. Highly recommend this place, especially the coconut soup!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I had to re-review because they're SO GOOD. I feel almost guilty eating this food. Their portions are huge, and they give you so much of the good stuff.  Simply: Great portions They deliver til 4pm (What other Thai place does this?) Their food is spice well/appropriately (they'll stop you if you're about to mess up) They're super nice/their Customer Service is incredible.  Let me put it this way. I have never had Green Pineapple Curry, but the person I spoke to on the phone described what I was going to experience, flavor-wise, perfectly. I ordered it with Mussels, and I got SO MANY. For Seafood eaters out there: You know it's a total bummer when you get like 5 total pieces of seafood because the restaurant wants to skimp.  Also, no issues with time here. The food was ready in 20 minutes as promised. I love them for pick up/take out.   I eat so much that I can't stop and it hurts. Yum. Yum. Yum."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have been on the hunt for new places and foods to eat for lunch.  She suggested us going here and the first thing I did was go onto Yelp to read the reviews.  Thank you in advance for everyone reviewing the place, because if I didn't read the reviews and just went here... I would have reversed and drove to back to work.  I have NO idea how they are able to fit a kitchen in this facility, but they make it work.  The place is very small, the place is smaller than 600 sq. ft. but they make it work with 2 booths and 3-4 tables.  Food was amazing, I got the tofu drunken noodles, spice level 3,and that was enough heat for me. I had heartburn afterwards but that is my fault for not taking an acid reducer prior to eating spicy food.  Other than this place being small, there are no complaints. My lunch was 7 dollars and that is cheaper compared to the other Thai resturants right off broadway because they charge 9 dollars for the same food.  The food was good and I would come again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome thai food :) happy happy... Loved it... Chilli garlic chicken entree n pad thai both tasted awesome... N there complimentary jasmine green tea ice cream completed our meal :) will b gng again n again :) :)"}
{"text":"Best Panang curry in the valley, everything else is darn good too, and I love thai food."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and we were greeted and seated immediately. We both ordered two different types of curry. Both were excellent. Regarding the heat, we both ordered 2. It was a little hotter than I expected but I didn't mind at all. Then we got a wonderful surprise...free desert! My was it tasty. Pineapple and coconut. C'mon, two of my faves in one?! The meal put us back about $22. Very good food and good service so we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was how friendly the guy taking my order over the phone was. I arrived a little earlier than the estimated time given to me and they just apologized it wasn't ready yet. They gave me a water bottle and a scoop of ice cream while I waited. I'm not sure if that's just what comes with meals, but that ice cream was awesome. Pretty sure it was coconut.  I ordered the chicken pad thai (level 4 spice) and egg rolls. The pad thai was great - level 4 wasn't that spicy for any spicy food lovers. I'll have to go 5 next time. Egg rolls were okay, not the best. I'm super thrilled to have found this place so close to home, but bummed it took me so long considering I've passed by it so many times."}
{"text":"so far Crab puffs , fresh rolls, chicken pad thai, chow mien and shrimp fried rice were great :-)"}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place after driving by it so many times and reading the rave reviews. In short: it was amazing. Best Pad Thai I've ever had: balanced sauce, plentiful portions and great flavor. The staff is incredibly friendly and offered a complimentary bottle of water with the takeout. Will come back, and often!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chanpen has finally opened a larger restaurant to accommodate the multitude of customers they have. This is Thai food that has not been modified for American palates.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I hadn't found a great Thai place that I actually adored until I came here. Not only is their service absolutely amazing (complimentary ice cream, squeal!), but the food is to die for. Their Pad Thai is fantastic and their curries are amazing. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. I recommend the Pad See Ew and at a level 2 spicy is still extremely flavorful and spicy. Was even given delicious complimentary green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai place! Probably the best I've tasted in the Phoenix area! My favorite here is the drunken noodle, but everything I've tasted has been great!"}
{"text":"I got the yellow curry and it was absolutely delicious. As we sat down, they immediately brought us this tasty cabbage soup. Would definitely recommend to anyone trying to get their Thai fix :D"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a long time and it has always been amazing. But! Today I ordered to go and my food was really cold and it seem to be someone's left overs. Lunch special usually comes with egg roll and it didn't even have it and there was pieces of white rice and a huge ball of peanut"}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the pad Thai with fried tofu. I only got the spicy at a '3' b/c I had to run the next morning, and I wanted to be the only thing running. Anyway, the food was great, right up there with other great places in the Valley. I got it with fried tofu (vegetarian). The fried tofu was okay, not great, but that didn't take away from the dish. Really great taste, and the veggie egg-roll was perfect.  The place was crowded with a huge line, and the parking lot was full. Great signs confirmed by the great food and fast service. I was out of there in a half-hour.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My coworker discovered this tiny little Thai restaurant nearby my work. First time I attempted to get here, I drove through lots of cones due to construction as though I was in a obstacle course. When I was almost there, the street was blocked off! We ended up taking residential side street. Needless to say, I drove thru crack or pot houses before I got here. All excited to check out what the fuss is all about .... The restaurant was full. With less than 10 tables at the restaurant, I finally gave up and ate somewhere else.   Second attempt: we were determined to get here by 11:30am to get a table. YES! There was one. I ordered a Drunken noodle dish that was highly recommended by my coworker and man.....IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! Every bite is seasoned and juicy. Not to mention it was hot as hell to my liking. When I look inside the kitchen, yes....the cooks are also Thai (can't get more authentic than that).   Regardless how crowded and how unpleasant the surrounding is, I will come back here again and again.   BEST THAI RESTAURANT EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"So, I heard about this place via another Yelper's check-ins the same week I read about it on one of the food bloggers.  So, I bookmarked it.  Oh Wowzer!   If you're in your car reading this review and looking for a place to eat... Uhm... Go here.  I will be honest, I've not ventured into other options on their menu.  I've been stuck on the first thing that I tried here.  The garlic chicken is simply amazing.  A very spicy and flavorful dish that lights your taste buds up and sets your mouth aflame.    Don't be afraid to stop in here because it is very small.  There is an option to sit in the tiny dining room.  There may be 6 3-top tables in the dining room.    Whatever you do. Please be patient."}
{"text":"If \"Wow\" was sufficient for a fair and usefull review I'd do just that. Then I realized that I cannot do a 5 so it is not realy appropriate.  I will give full disclosure and advise that I am doing this review in a state of mind and body of exhaustion and pain. Been a very long week of work. So my review may be a bit skewed because of my personal state of being.  Ambiance is quite nice. Restroom is clean but I do not know if it is by design or just working with space available but there is a giant water heater in mens room that make it quite uncomfortably hot.  Food is absolutely fantastic. Portions are great two people can easily share an appetizer and an éntre.  That being said the price is just barely above cheep eats but the food is very good so that is where some of the 5th  went.  Regarding heat preferences for the spicy dishes. Unless you are into S&M you probabaly will not want to go above a 3 on their scale.  Try the place out. I'm sure that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum. Grew up in NYC and have been to Thailand. This is good food. Decor is modest, but the food and service is amazing."}
{"text":"First time here... The food was good, I really enjoyed the Spicy Fried Rice I got a 3 to start but is think next time I'm going with a 4. Everyone was very kind and friendly. I would recommend you arrive early or do take out, the sitting is limited."}
{"text":"I chose this place for lunch because I was craving thai or chinese food and it was the closest place to my job. I ordered the chicken fried rice lunch special which came with a veggie spring roll and wontons along with sweet and sour sauce. My rice was a little more on the soggy side; I wouldn't necessarily say it was fried rice, but it was still very flavorful. Everything tasted really good & their pieces of chicken are nice and big yet thin so it works out perfectly.  The restaurant is nicely decorated & quaint. They offered me a complimentary drink while I picked up my order and it was a nice gesture. I am still very eager to try some of their noodles because I have heard they are really delicious. Also, they ask what level of spice you'd like your food at, and I think thats great because I do prefer some spice in my dishes!"}
