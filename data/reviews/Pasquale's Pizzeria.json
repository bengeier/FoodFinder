{"text":"I ordered food from here a few nights ago, and went to pick it up, since it is very close to my home. The service was good, polite but not very knowledgeable of the menu and specials. I returned home with my order, just not what i would expect from a small chain pizza place.  The buffalo chicken hoagie was cold, the chicken was of the frozen and with some franks red hot drenching it and cheese. Could not put myself through eating it. The wings looked as if they were harvested from market square pigeons, they were cruncky and grease ridden. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, and quickly realized this place should not be making pizza. The crust was bland and soggy and amounted to not much of it. The sauce could have been directly from a can, and the cheese was like paste. Will not be ordering again. Not at 47 dollars for food that was not edible."}
{"text":"Sadly, I've had better pizza at Get Go and the cheese stix looked like the driver stopped at the 7/11 on the way. $40 in the trash."}
{"text":"Called to place an order for delivery and was told they do not deliver to our house.  We live less than 5 minutes away!!!  We'll gladly give our money to another pizza place.  Get a map."}
{"text":"Pasquale's is quickly becoming my favorite pizza spot in the area. I've only had one disappointing pizza, and quite honestly, I was more not feeling my decision than unhappy with the pizza. Their dough is excellent and is always cooked to perfection. Their red sauce is a little sweet, but not cloyingly so. I generally do not like sweet pizza sauces but I enjoy theirs very much. It's just a touch of sweetness which balances well with the savory herbs.  I've had a number of the specialty pizzas: feta spinach, spinach deluxe, chicken ranch, and a couple others. They've all been delicious. What's truly amazing is how many toppings they can get on a pizza and still have the slices hold up so you don't need utensils to eat it. Did I mention they have good dough?  I normally don't bother with breadsticks at pizza places, they aren't generally very good IMHO, but I've ordered just for the breadsticks. Again, good dough. :)  Pasquale's is pretty close to me so I can't comment on delivery. They do charge a delivery fee. Generally not a fan of that practice but it seems to be fairly common in this area. Lucky for me, they are just a hop, skip and a jump away."}
{"text":"Great pizza and tasty appetizers!  The service was excellent, even though it was very busy!   Always a good customer experience!  I highly reccomend Pasquale's for all you pizza lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and quick prep. Fair prices. Have gotten take out from here several times."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant.  We have been ordering pizza from Pasquale's for years and have never been disappointed.  The food is great and is something all of my picky eaters agree on.  The restaurant is also extremely clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for 5 years always great food and only once did not get my reward points, called store and they were fixed. Good prices always delivered hot and fresh. I work at Main Gate at Irvin works and order fairly reg. Had to cut back though I am diabetic and the pizza I love, cannot eat just one piece lol."}
{"text":"As a business and for convenience, I really like this place. The owner is a great guy. My \"problem\" is with the new addition to the menu, the \"Sicilian Pizza\".  Frankly, the crust is terrible.  Too airy and basically tasteless.  I was told it's made with fresh dough.  I have a hard time believing it is. Pasquale's, if you want to taste some GOOD Sicilian, pick up a Sicilian pie from Pizza Roma. Sorry guys, you blew this one."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a couple times and were timely and the food tasted hot and fresh each time.  Ordered the chicken parm dinner, and it is absolutely great value at under $10, and it tastes great!"}
{"text":"The first thing is they charge for delivery, which is basically stealing tips from their drivers. I ordered a calzone, and it was mostly rock hard dense crust- maybe 5 square inches of filling- which was a glop of cheap runny ricotta right out of the container, without even a bit of egg or grated cheese to bind it- a tiny amount of cheese and no onions as ordered. I guess the steak strips were so tough because it was overcooked.     I ordered zucchini fries- pencil thin, burnt batter and I had difficulty finding anything resembling zucchini inside them. I threw them away.  The marinara was canned Hunt's spagetti sauce- which I swear someone threw a bunch of dried oregano and garlic salt in raw- inedible. Into the garbage it went too.     I also ordered what passes for a gyro from a fast food place in Pittsburgh- frozen identical slabs, exactly as expected. (There ARE real off the spit gyro places in Pittsburgh-not a slam on my town.)      The tzaziki sauce was the generic garlic powder/\"yogurt\" (and fillers) from a tub kind.     Also, they forgot my ranch on the side- but didn't forget to charge me for onions and sauce.       Just a careless half-assed and disappointing experience and I will never be ordering from them again, even though they're 1/4 mile away."}
{"text":"i ordered for the  first time  today.    the pizza was  great,the  chicken wings  fantastic. the stromboli      very good.  fast   delivery too.    this will be  my  new pizza place."}
{"text":"First time calling and anticipating a delicious Sicilian pizza! Was put on hold 3 times and then after ordering was told I'm to far outside their delivery area. I'M 2 MILES AWAY!!!   ACTUALLY I GIVE THEM A ZERO  but I couldn't post a review without at least one."}
{"text":"We order from here every few weeks.  My kids love their pizza and pepperoni rolls.   The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Robin S  Love this place! The food is fabulous! The owner is amazing. A great place to get pizza and sandwiches from. Bring the family to eat in their dining room."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in my order this evening. I have ordered from Pasquale Pizza many times Over the years, but tonight they completely blew it. I ordered at 5:27 PM and was told the order would be delivered within an hour. Call back after an hour and a half they told me that the delivery was in the car on the way to the house. Called back again after two hours and was told again that the delivery was in the car and on the way to my house. Called a third time after three hours waiting and was told that I had never placed the delivery order and that there was nothing in their computer system saying that I have ever ordered from them before. Needless to say They lost a long time customer tonight.   UPDATED REVIEW - I decided to give Pasquale Pizza another chance, as I was craving a spinach feta pizza. This time they took the order correctly, and delivered the food in a timely fashion. Everything was good and the pizza was great"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza here was very good. It reminded me a bit of Little Ceasar's deep dish pizza. Which is amazing, and I want to emphasize deep dish and not regular $5 Little Ceasar's mind you. While the cheese, thickness, and sauce reminded me of it, I have to say that the crust at Pasquale's was much better. Perfectly crispy. It's definitely one of my new favorite places, and they have good deals if you pick up."}
{"text":"Buffalo   Chicken Rolls are the BEST!  We have ordered from here for years, on average 1-2x's a week and we have rarely ever had a problem.  We are appreciative for the \"save 10 receipts and get a FREE large Pizza\".  I would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I found the delivery times to be poor and service less than stellar when I called to ask when I'd be receiving my food.  The pizza was serviceable but not worth the hassle. Not certain I'll be trying them again with other great options in the area."}
{"text":"A very standardly great pizza. I choose Pasquale's over all of the chains for the obvious reasons; the pizza simply tastes better and the price is better. I'm a foodie who enjoys a simple and satisfying pizza without breaking the bank. Based on taste price and location, Pasquale's is my choice. 6.50 for a small cheese that will leave you very satisfied. AND if your taste is similar to mine, you value a pizza that you look forward to eating either cold or microwaved the next day. I always save a slice or two to enjoy as left overs."}
{"text":"Good hot pizza that comes to your door FAST! The new location is very convenient and offers a sit down area. Nice family owned local franchise that supports the local community."}
{"text":"Pasquale's is a great local restaurant that supports their local community.  My friends regularly get pizza and meatball sub sandwiches from here.  They are great!  Oh, and you can get delivery.    What did I learn today?  Meatball sub $8.50.  A great deal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in pittsburgh. My husband and I were doing the 'Pittsburgh best Pizza' from 2012 and this is by far better than any on that list! Also, if you sign up for the reward club, they send you great Coupons in your email. We literally get pizza here every weekend!"}
{"text":"I'm completely making this up, but Pasquale's Pizza serves up what I call Pittsburgh-style pizza.  What is Pittsburgh-style pizza?  It's the kind of pizza that I ate growing up from the local pizzeria's in Pittsburgh, with thick chewy bubbly crust, a good helping of sweet-spicy tomato sauce, and lots of greasy cheese.  Toppings?  Nothing but the basics - no eggplant, no sun-dried tomatoes, no feta cheese, etc, etc.  I'm home to visit my parents in Pittsburgh and ordering out in this house means pizza.  I was feeling lazy - didn't want to wait for or bother to retrieve Mineo's from Squirrel Hill so we went with this place which is super close.   It was exactly what I was hoping for, not amazing but good. I like this pizza.  The crust was crisp, but not burnt on the bottom , and chewy throughout.  There was the right balance of sauce, and it was sweet-spicy as I like it.  On the down side while there was a decent amount of  toppings, they were chopped a bit small for me.  Anyway it was cheap for an x-large pizza and it was ready pretty quickly."}
{"text":"WOW Tonight was reallllllly BAD. Ordered 2 pizzas, what a total MESS. Pizzas arrived, I noticed boxes were both soaked thru with grease......opened them......clearly they had been dropped or something......the cheese was all over the lid, pooled into a huge mess in one end of box, all the pepperoni in a clump at one end, rest of pizza absent of cheese and pepperoni.....but......I decided to just scoop it over the pizza and 'fix it'.....when taking it out of box, realized it wasn't cut clear thru either, then realized the crust was paper thin, soaked in grease......just totally disgusting. Both pizzas were the same. Breadsticks were under done as well, pale light, greasy, doughy......this is the one time I actually would call and demand a refund.....but the person who took order sounded rushed and I'm just not even going any further with this review......except to say: I'm no longer a customer of this business.....I'm done.....it was THAT bad.... I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find a pizza shop offering gluten free crust.  It is only available in the small size, which has 6 smallish slices.  I chose the Chicken Broccoli speciality pizza which has white sauce, chicken, broccoli, tomato, and extra cheese.  I requested that they hold the tomato and add mushrooms instead. I ate three slices (they are small, it's a 10\" crust) and savored every bite.  The next day I heated the remaining three slices.  It wasn't quite as good reheated and I blotted it with paper toweling to remove extra oil.  But it was still a good meal.  I appreciated that the broccoli topping was relatively finely chopped, no large florets to manage.  Very good flavor.  I wish that I lived closer, but their number is going into my contacts list!!  I forgot to mention that the service was courteous and pleasant.  This was at the Aspinwall location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza place. Everything is exceptional. We always judge a pizza place starting with a simple pepperoni pizza and Italian hoagie. They have the best around. Their specialty pizzas are amazing. The spinach deluxe is my favorite. It's so much more than a regular white/spinach pizza - onions, mushrooms, bacon - YUM!  I highly recommend the pretzel bites appetizer with garlic butter sauce.  And, the service is great. They are always smiling and friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I got a super sarcastic response when trying to order off the online menu. Not my fault that your menu link isn't updated. Don't be so rude and maybe you'd get more business."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and they were nice enough, but salad was lackluster. I love a good steak salad, but I have NO EARTHLY CLUE what the meat on that salad was! The iceberg was also a bit sad. They need to stick to pizza..."}
{"text":"Food sucks found a bug in my pizza and they made a big deal about me getting my money back or a new pizza don't eat here"}
{"text":"Pasquale's Pizza in Penn Hills isn't a bad place to take the kids for a reasonably priced dinner. The kids love it. The service is great for the several times we have been there. The pizza is hot and served promptly. I like the can sodas, just enough for the little ones. The restaurant is clean and offers plenty of tables and seats for a family of four to six. For a chain pizza shop the prices are reasonable and the food isn't bad either. I have to comment on the restrooms - clean and safe for little ones. They offer coupons."}
{"text":"Pasquale's has decent pizza but ordering has gotten harder, and sometimes you either have to correct an order or they forget something.   And don't even bother signing up for their rewards/points program as I ordered a ton from them and my points never went up above 47.   They won't correct the problem either.    Good crust, so-so on portion of toppings,  decent amount of cheese, but I'd rather get a coupon before I eat here again.   Still upset about the points program not being honored properly."}
{"text":"My experience with this place was unacceptable. We called and were told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour max for pickup. We got there about 50 minutes after we called, and our order was not ready. They finally completed the order, and it was the wrong order;they forgot half of our order. It took far too long for our correct order to be completed. It took well into 2 hours before we could finally leave with our order. I understand that places can be busy, but be honest about your wait time. They were clearly aware that it would be much longer than 45 minutes since there were multiple people waiting there before us whose order they messed up as well. They were entirely unapologetic, and even took an attitude with us. I have been to this place a couple other times and haven't had any major issues, but I will not be returning after my recent experience. The quality is average to begin with and absolutely not worthy of a 2 hour + wait."}
{"text":"Hands down...the best pizzeria in penn hills. Top 3 in Pittsburgh. Their pizzas r so  packed with viggies and meats. They dont skimp on any part of preparation. Whenever i have events and ppl wanna eat from the best pizza shop in penn hills i always order from here. I would reccomend them to anyone in the area. The food is perfect."}
{"text":"Was nearby and ordered from Pasquale!s Pizza and had them deliver and the delivery driver Did not even give me my change that was due just kept the change. Do not think will be ordering from them again and have it delivered especially."}
{"text":"My wife and I order from here all of the time, and we have not had a complaint yet. The pizza has a great crust that is just airy enough, but still has a crisp to it. The sauce is delicious along with the cheese. Delivery is always extremely fast. For the money, it is a great go to pizza for pizza night."}
{"text":"We order from here a lot as its one of the only places that delivers to our house. Food always arrives hot. Delivery guys are always friendly.   Love the Hawaiian pizza and the meatball hoagie. Have had the wings and wouldn't recommend. Breadsticks were ok. The pizza and hoagie are really where it's at. Check the website before ordering- they have lots of coupons."}
{"text":"First of all let me preface this by saying that I like spices on my food this place was very Bland for my taste. I wanted to get a white pizza and was surprised when they told me that they don't have any garlic nor do they have garlic powder I don't know how you can be an Italian restaurant and not use garlic that's all I have to say about that"}
{"text":"After many experiments and months of trying other local pizza joints. My fiancé and I have settled on Pasquale's. We order at least twice a month. The pizza is very tasty and always consistent."}
{"text":"i always order food from this place never have no problems until now i know mistakes happen i ordered a 4 cut veggie pizza when i opened the box pizza was stuck upside down first time in how many times i ordered from the m never a problem hell mistakes happen ill still stick with these guys"}
{"text":"The breadsticks are the best here!  Coated with olive oil and herbs and sprinkled with  cheese.  However, the pizza is just OK.  Never bad, never amazing.  They do delivery though and they are personable."}
{"text":"This has to be the best pizza!!! It definitely is my favorite!!! Service is great and pizza is always hot and super tasty!!!"}
{"text":"In a neighborhood where pizza shops seemingly go to die, Pasquale's is the latest business giving it the ol' college try in Aspinwall. Apparently they are a local chain of sorts, having five other locations scattered around the greater Pittsburgh area. Their Aspinwall location is right on Freeport Road next to the karate studio (because why WOULDN'T you want to smell pizza while you're working on your black belt, am I right?)  Anyway, my husband and I decided to give this new place a shot a month or so ago. We ordered some very basic pizza shop goodies -- a large cheese pizza, some boneless buffalo wings, and cheesy garlic bread. We live close by and opted to walk over to pick it up, but they do offer delivery to the surrounding areas.  The verdict is that this is just another very average pizza place. Nothing special. The cheese pizza was good, but not great. The cheese was a little plastic-y tasting and the sauce was a bit bland. We did enjoy the thick and chewy crust, however. The boneless wings were baked, not fried, so they were not greasy, which is a good thing. And while they were sufficiently meaty and crunchy, they were sparsely sauced...in fact, about half of the wings didn't have any sauce at all. Shame, shame, Pasquale's! Lastly, the garlic cheese bread, again, was nothing special. I was hoping for a delicious, garlicky, butter-soaked bread bonanza, but instead was met with a rather bland, sparsely-buttered piece of french bread with some cheese on it. Sad trombone.  Overall, I was not super impressed. They've only been open for a few months, so maybe they're still working out the kinks, and for that reason I might give 'em another try someday, who knows?"}
{"text":"Super flame super bomb all that stuff! Ordered a pizza through grub hub and it got here 20 minutes before the quoted time. It was really hot and only $9 for a small buffalo chicken. Oh and pizza is the way to my heart I don't play any games about it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with mushrooms and extra cheese. It came without the extra cheese. I've ordered pizza from there many times before and was pleased.  I called the store to let them know of their oversight. A guy got on the phone and said he was the one who made the pizza and, instead of thanking me for the feedback, he argued with me and told me that he did put extra cheese on it. I'm very disappointed and will not order from there again."}
{"text":"I know it's hard to review a pizza place, because either it's good or it's not.  Pasquale's is most definitely good.  What prompted me to write this was my delivery's experience the other day.  It was the hottest pizza I have ever had delivered.  Not only that, while I was trying to balance everything at the door, the delivery guy held the door for me.  Little things make a difference.  As far as food goes, the pizza is good and they don't skimp on toppings.  The subs are excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places around. Their crust is wonderful and it is the perfect ratio of sauce and cheese. Our favorites are the hot banana pepper, cheese, and their buffalo chicken pizza is awesome! Definitely recommend. We moved away and still come back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Decent, probably my favorite pizza in the Aspinwall area.  I've only ordered their pizza and can say I've yet to be disappointed.  The crust has a nice crunch to it and is chewy, with a dusting of cornmeal.  The toppings have always been generous, with a good sauce and cheese.  Staff are friendly for as miserable as they must feel working in that heat.  It's always hot as hell inside, which doesn't matter to me for takeout."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Pasquales, but my 5th time eating their food. until this trip it has been enjoyable. As soon as I walked in i noticed a different demeanor in the staff. i dont know if its poor business or just general displeasure of being there. It made me uncomfortable.   After a 5 hour trip home from Philadelphia, I wanted a nice filling meal which I didnt have to cook. Fontanas is closed on Mondays so I turned to Pasquales. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, Pasta al a Vodka, and Cheese sticks all to go. order was ready when i arrived as promised. check was a little steep for takeout but i figured \"eh, its better than cooking\". got home and tore into the cheese sticks, Frozen from a package, damn, hope at least the sauce is decent. Fail, sauce is flavorless and seems to be merely tomato paste and puree mixed. no spice, no seasoning. Grabbed the Ragu from the fridge and microwaved it for 30 seconds, clearly better than the sauce provided. Next I tore into the Chicken Parmesan. UGH, same bland sauce I encountered in the Cheese Stick incident. The Chicken isnt even pounded out properly, if at all. so cutting into the thick chicken breasts is difficult and results in all the breading coming off the meat. Linguine was at least cooked well but I also had to eat this with Ragu to make it palatable. This was by far the poorest showing by Pasquales in my book. wish I had my money back.   My ratings on a scale of 1-5, one being poor 5 being superb.   Price 0.5/5 The pricing should be zero because the food is so bad.  Presentation 2/5  the atmosphere of Pasquales is mediocre at best. however living in irwin this is the standard (cry a little).  Taste/Quality 1/5 Only reason not 0/5 is for the linguine as it was prepared correctly. That sad excuse for sauce should not be ingested by humans. Ever. Seriously, EVER.  Overall Experience 1/5 Never Never again will i give this establishment my money, I suggest you dont either."}
{"text":"Love the flavor of the crust - almost tastes like garlic bread! We were looking for a great tasting and well made calzone and we finally found we truly enjoyed. Out of the local pizza places, this has had the best calzone. Looking forward to trying their hoagies and other selections. Fortunate to have a wide variety of pizza places in the area that all have different, but great pizza."}
{"text":"Pasquale's Pizzeria is a local chain that serves up your standard menu of pizza, salad, wings, et cetera, all with a big smile and at a low price.  The pizza is at its best fresh out of the oven, and hits all the right notes: crisp but not brittle crust, gooey molten cheese, tomato sauce with hints of natural sweetness, and a goofy contented grin on your face after you've devoured your first slice.  The boneless wings are my favorite, though: get them dusted with seasoned salt and get your wing sauce on the side, and the package is dynamite (or at least, given the binary nature of the seasoned salt-dusted wings and the sauce on the side, it's Tannerite ...).  The staff are of special mention here.  The lady who owns the place is very sweet, very motherly, and makes an effort to get to know each and every one of her customers.  The mom-and-pop store vibe, in other words, is as real as it gets.  The place is always quiet and peaceful -- given the fact that it's not particularly near anything (other than the Bettis plant), this makes a lot of sense.  Part of me wishes they were at a more advantageous location so they could get the business I think they deserve, but another part of me is glad that they're in such a secluded area -- it's nice to be able to sit in peace and eat your food without having to yell just to be heard by the person sitting next to you.  If you live anywhere within their delivery radius, I heartily recommend them."}
{"text":"I love their wings simply because they're baked- these guys are making a bold move doing this and in a Pittsburgh full of pizza shops with basic menus it's a bold step; although their calzones are small they're the 3rd best I've had in the city."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area! The subs are delicious as well!!! Yum!!!! My family and I always order from here weekly! The sauce is yum! Pizza is not greasy at all!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from Pasquale's Pizzeria several times now; I get the feeling it's going to be my go-to pizzeria in the area from here on out.  We've tried the pizza, wings, and oven-baked hoagies - all were excellent and the prices were very reasonable. Food has always been consistent and high quality.  I have only carried out at Pasquale's, so I cannot comment on their delivery radius or times, but I've seen a number of their cars going up and down route 8 and the surrounding streets."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite local pizza places!  They're spectacularly friendly, and the pizza is fantastic!  Normally, I don't expect much from a plain 'ol pepperoni pizza, but that's pretty much my staple here.  Wings are great & the sandwiches are very tasty!  I'm not sure if I order pizza too much, or they're just that awesome, but whenever I call they remember me (not just pretend to)! They actually make you feel like family (or at least that crazy neighbor who's welcome to come in at any time without knocking)!  I definitely recommend signing up for the rewards club! The regular perks you get through that, combined with the specials that they offer (right on the menu usually), put their price-point easily below any of the chains nearby, AND it tastes WAY better!  Thanks, Pasquale's for being awesome!  Keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"I dont like the new location however ive been getting there pizza since they have been open always great."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza at best. The cheese was low quality and had a bad taste to it. We ordered chick tenders and fries and both were burnt. I appreciate that they were baked and not fried but they tasted awful."}
{"text":"Delivery is always on time and food was still hot, decent prices, pizza is average (not a fan of the sauce, but the crust is crispy and delicious). The pepperoni rolls are amazing! Wings and hoagies were pretty good too! :)"}
