{"text":"This is our go-to chinese food joint.  The War-Wonton Soup is excellent.  Beyond that, nothing too special, but definitely get bang for your buck and fulfills that Chinese food craving.  They do give you free eggrolls and stuff if you order over $15 of food, though I think that's pretty typical."}
{"text":"Yuk.    It was conveniently located near us so we had some food delivered.   It was just awful.   Probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had, and I've had a lot.  I'm getting bad memories while writing this."}
{"text":"Upon further review.... I no longer visit this establishment. Not only did the lady behind the counter try to get into a conversation with me about the US Economy as she had with the previous customer... the food was rather awful the past two times I went. The first bad experience I brushed it off because the place was usually steadily decent for the price. The second time I gave up as my meal completely lacked flavor of any sort and got me sick (I think the food may not have been completely cooked).   I will never go to this establishment again. Off to find a new Chinese hole in the wall..."}
