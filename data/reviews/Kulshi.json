{"text":"One visited Kulshi only last evening. I returned home from another tedious day at the office, only to find the cupboards debauched and bare of any worthwhile living essentials. All that was missing from this scenario was the customary piece of tumble weed rolling slowly across the kitchen floor.  Something needed to be done, action needed to be taken, so as the indecisive person I am, on the toss of a coin it was eat out instead of take away. So I grabbed my wallet and coat and with my far better looking other half in tow we proceeded to leave the house.  After walking for 5-10 minutes to the glitzy bright lights of Urmston town centre we finally settled on the Kulshi as the place we would indulge in our culinary feast for the evening.  The excitement, the tension, the agony and the ecstasy were all there in equal measures as I flung open the door expecting to be greeted by a plethora of people wining/dining and generally having an altogether raucous time. In reality we were greeted to a completely barren restaurant which actually resembled my aforementioned kitchen cupboards, although with slightly less tumbleweed. We were quickly attended too and shown to our table with minimal fuss and shortly after a cool, crisp pint (and a half for the lady) of Cobra joined us. We decided to opt for the buffet option as we were both ravenous. Upon my arrival at the buffet area I was greeted to a host of starters of which I decided to test the whole range. All of which were to a good standard with the very humble and often overlooked Onion Bhaji being a stand out attraction. Then it was onto the main the event, the show stopper the reason you go to a curry house, and I don't mean for the exotic music, it's for the curry. Once again I used my now tried and tested method of trying everything on buffet stand and I was not to be disappointed. Usually I only go for the mild option of Korma but here I found myself over indulging in the Madras and the Lamb Rogan Josh, which were very worth adversaries to the much favored Korma. As the clocks approached 9 we decided to head home to catch the last in the series of The Hotel Inspector (I had cunningly Sky+ the show anyway in case things ran over) so we duly settled our bill and were on our merry way.  During our stay of just over an hour we were the only people in the entire restaurant, there is something strangely odd and sadistic about this but it was also something we actually enjoyed. Sometimes the truth can be stranger than fiction. Overall, I would have to say it was great value for money, only £10 each for the buffet and I could not really fault the food. I also enjoyed the setting and could see the place being very bustling and lively over the weekend evenings. I feel we shall visit again, probably during another mid-week but hopefully there might be at least one other table of people to share in our experience."}

We had to make several phone calls to chase them up, all in all disappointing. Need to do a lot better before we would consider using them again."}
{"text":"If you fancy a banquet then Kulshi is the place for you.It is a Bangladeshi, family- run restaurant in Urmston town centre and occupies a curved corner building that was originally a billiard hall. Several businesses have occupied the space over the years but I am confident that Kulshi is here to stay. The building is impressive with high carved ceilings and exposed brickwork, and the furniture is all long oak tables with leather chairs. Black and White prints of Hollywood legends fill the wall space.   I am sure all nights of the week are fantastic at Kulshi but Yelpers, I highly recommend you to try this restaurant on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday when you will experience the magic of the never ending £10 a head buffet, (£5.95 for under 10 year olds).  Over 20 courses of starters and main dishes stretch out in a self-service layout for you to try. I went with my good friend who is Indian and she really  knows how to cook!! She loves this place and says that it is a popular haunt for the community so you cannot get a better recommendation than that.   So now for the starters: I piled bhajees, tandoori chicken and the most divine lamb chops onto my plate( if there is anyone in your group who cannot take spicy food, Kulshi looks after them too and serves nuggets and chips). There are salads and chutneys galore and then you reach the mains. Lamb Roghan Josh, Chicken Korma, I could not stop putting them onto my plate, and this isn't even my first serving! This food is brilliant and it serves a good variety of vegetarian dishes also. The atmosphere is paradoxical: relaxed but busy at the same time. There is Indian music playing , everyone is laughing and loving the cuisine.   The only part of the meal that is actually served is the dessert, and for very good reason; the choice is so huge that you could literally make yourself ill by taking portions too big. Kulshi serves banana fritters, mini donuts, banoffee pie, cheesecake and \"Keer\"-the traditional indian rice pudding. Unusual flavoured ice cream such as liquorice (love it or hate it), and blueberry make their way into my bowl. The Kulshi reminds me of a mother who insists everyone who visits her house cannot leave until they are stuffed! You don't have to book but I suggest that you do, because even though Kulshi can comfortably seat 140 people, weekends are crazy .  Wonderful food, nice staff, open 7 days a week, it is perfect for the whole family."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the Urmston area and looking for a unique dining experience, perhaps you should try Kulshi. Set in an old roller-skating rink, the interior of this restaurant is much more impressive than the exterior. A half-moon shaped arch glides across the space, making it feel rather like a lost underground chamber or secret dungeon, and the tables are sectioned into red-brick booths. Sounds strange but the overall effect feels rather majestic.  The menu offers the best of traditional Indian dishes, including Spicy  Kebabs, Chicken Tikka, Korma, Masala, Dhansak, Malay, Aloo Gobi, Jalfrezi, Vindaloo and Madras; the latter of which have got some real kick to them (something that seems to have been lost in a lot of Indian cuisine over the last decade). Most dishes are very generously portioned and come with fresh condiments without the need to ask.  Whilst this may not be the best Indian I've ever eaten, I can't deny that it's a steal for the price and the ambience. Not only can you look for 2-1 offers on their website or discounts at www.onionring.co.uk, but there's also a fantastic buffet, with endless choices for just £10 a head. There's not many Indian restaurants left like this anymore so take advantage whilst you can!"}
