{"text":"very nice place, good service.  the coffee is inconsistent, as are the pastry offerings.  Never bad, just not always great."}
{"text":"You pull into the parking lot of the Bill Green Shopping Center to go to the UPS store or for the Wine & Spirits store and the aroma hits you.  Fresh Coffee!  Thoughts go through your mind...  What's that I smell?  Where is this place?  Who the heck is teasing me?  Then you see the huge folding window of the storefront open (even in cooler weather) & people just inside enjoying conversation, drinking coffee ot tea beverages.  Then, you have no choice, you must investigate.  Finally, a place to get good coffee without having to drive around to two or more towns away, or worse yet, to have to settle for something less than coffee (I.e.; Danny's or McDonald's. YUCK!)  The staff are fantastic.  They greet you with a smile, are knowledgeable about the coffees & teas and are willing to customize that beverage you so desperately want.   The coffees my wife & I enjoy there are flavorful, aromatic & plentiful.  Some varieties of beans for purchase are a bit on the pricey side, but the daily brews are pleasing to the wallet.  They are about where a good cup of coffee should be.  We highly recommend visiting here for your next few cups of coffee.  You will return again and again.  We do!  Did I mention that they have pastries?   Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Coffee Tree Roaster coffee.  It's really sour for my taste, but I will come to this location, simply because it's convenient for doing work.  They have the large windows at the front and plenty of outlets along the wall.  They also have plenty of seating as you head further into the coffee shop.  Also, the wifi never seems to work for me.  Maybe you have to go further into the coffee shop, but I prefer to sit near the front."}
{"text":"I really like this place to meet with friends for a cup of coffee or get some work done or whatever. Sometimes it's tricky to try to concentrate depending on what time of the day you go in. It gets very busy after like 3-5pm and stays that way up until around 9-10pm.. But overall, they have decent coffee and treats."}
{"text":"Pricey, but one of the best coffee shops around.  I think the bulk coffee in particular is overpriced."}
{"text":"Did I mention in my last review that I love coffee? I mean, I can still remember getting doughnuts in the 3rd grade and hearing a friend say, \"boy would a glass of milk be good with this,\" to which I replied \"milk, how about some coffee?\" Yeah, at 9 years old I can thank my grandmother for that...  Needless to say by the time I was in Junior High it was on to espresso & cappuccinos. While the name \"Starbucks\" was certainly know back in those days, in my neighborhood the only place to find one was in a Barns & Noble. The Coffee Tree turned out to be our only true, stand alone coffee house and the place I was introduced to coffee culture!  So, when this new location opened near us, I was pumped! Sure we have a Caribou Coffee & Starbucks now (both do a great job providing consistently excellent brews), but I like the idea of a local place that knows how to make a good cappuccino. The coffee is always excellent and aside from their usual offerings, they'll rotate out some special blends and roasts throughout the year.  Finally, this location has a front wall of windows which slide completely open giving the entire caf√© an outdoor feel, with the comforts of AC! The Staff has been great so far too, if you're in the area, check them out!"}
{"text":"I love CTR and am always pleased with what I get from them, from regular coffee to a Cappuccino to whole beans for home. I wish they had more shops in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Locally owned alternative to the coffee monopoly.  Very nice environment....like how they are able to open the window front during nicer weather"}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice place to work, but it's getting more and more crowded recently.  tip: they have a study room at the back. the internet connection will needs a user/password after 2 hours that you can get at the counter. if you are cold, sit away from the window garage opening."}
{"text":"A good place to study and hang out. Nice decor inside, and it's also pleasant to sit by the huge open window at the storefront in the summertime. The fact that this place is open from 6am to midnight is incredibly convenient. Overall there is usually a good balance of people who are meeting friends and people who are studying/reading/working, which creates a quiet, but lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on coffee. I have enjoyed all of the whole bean coffees I have purchased from tree roasters by the pound though. The fact they provide the roast date is a nice touch so you know the window you have when the coffee will be the freshest. They have excellent rewards through the loyalty tree program for frequent customers as well."}
{"text":"Always a sure bet for people watching. Great seasonal drinks. Basic coffee is just okay. The big couches are great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Andrew is the best barista! He's super friendly and always makes my decaf extra large horchata frozachino just how I like it!"}
{"text":"I have recently become a coffee shop bum (and my reviews are beginning to reflect this) but I enjoy this place. It definitely is busy (which is a good sign) but can be difficult to find a comfortable seat. The drinks are great and the staff is really friendly.   Their late hours are ideal for students or those that just run better late at night. The fireplace and quiet room are cool additions to an already pretty neat space.   The only thing I wish was a bit better was the wifi situation - luckily I was able to get a bunch done without the need for it. Definitely going to keep coming back here and enjoying the space/drinks!"}
{"text":"For coffee this is the place to go (the other locations are equally good on this count).  That is their focus and they have it down.  Once in a great while they do burn the coffee on the brewer at this location, and it is obvious in contrast to the otherwise superlative brew they normally serve.  I can immediately smell it before I even taste the cup, and they will happily swap me for a different pot.  Beans to go are also the best in town.  The mid range varieties (like Cost Rica) are an excellent deal.  Their baked goods selection has some real jewels, but the inventory is overwhelmed by a dozen varieties of pound cake, which is mediocre.  The Bakery Square location has a great patio area around it for nice days.  On inclement days, you can count on one environment inside: cold.  Summer or winter it is the low 60s, so dress appropriately.  All in all, a top spot for the coffee aficionado.  For pastries and a lounging vibe there are better options."}
{"text":"Great service and great coffee selection!  During nice weather they open up the front wall window which makes for a very pleasant environment.  Small downside, Free wifi is only limited to two hours."}
{"text":"Great interactions, very friendly workers and customers (most of the time). Don't waste your time on the wifi though, it's horrible!"}
{"text":"Barista care varies widely and therefore so does the quality of your drink! But they open at 5:30 AM on weekdays so if you're an early bird, this is your spot (and only choice) in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Great coffee that you don't wait 15 min for like most coffee shops. Pastries are usually quite mediocre, though I recently really enjoyed the ham and cheese croissant with fennel seed. 4 stars because I come for the coffee not the pastry, and can always bring in a baked goodie from the bakery across the street. Nice atmosphere in the front of the shop, not as much in the back."}
{"text":"Good for a nice cup of coffee but their beverages are typically very hot and they do not give you a sleeve to keep the heat away from your hands. I recommend ordering a tea or iced coffee. The pastries and food usually taste stale. It's really nice when they open the garage door during the summer. Studying here is nice because most people are quiet too. A nice diversion from the Starbucks in the area with some really cool decor!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot for coffee and great for studying. There are a lot of tables and chairs, which is something I find a lot of coffee shops lack. When the weather is warmer, they open the front of the shop, which is giant paneled window that functions like a garage door.  The staff are nice and efficient. There is also a large selection of snacks and quick bites, making it easy to stay there for a while."}
{"text":"This particular branch of Coffee Tree is dirty, dingy, warm, and small, and it often has sticky surfaces.  The coffee is great, but I'd rather stoop to the level of Starbucks a block away than risk getting some crazy infection from drinking my coffee in a cesspool."}
{"text":"This Coffee Tree Roasters store has an excellent location, good coffee and tea, and a cozy atmosphere.  The glass room in the back is excellent for studying, reading, or doing other quiet activities, and the restrooms, when they are working, are kept pretty clean.  The issue I have with the store, though, is that the staff is always unfriendly and, at times, can be downright impolite.  They never smile and consistently seem to be grumpy.  While the drinks are good, I'll try to avoid Coffee Tree Roasters and visit one of the other fine coffee shops on Walnut Street if I can."}
{"text":"The space is nice and open - airy. The wifi signal is weak. The drinks are not so great. I hated the \"pearls\" in the smoothie. The fruit smoothie didn't seem fresh - maybe fruit flavor from a carton....?  The frozen Carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie. Iced coffee and regular coffee are ok. I didn't get any food - snacks here."}
{"text":"I think all of the reviews here are spot on.  I spend a lot of time there studying,  and I find the baristas (do they call people who work at coffee shops that aren't Starbucks that??) there to be just about the unhappiest lot I've ever encountered.  I try not to fault them TOO much for this, as I've worked retail before (though never food service, and I am completely aware that food service may very well be worse), and they probably deal with a lot of grade A d-bags (am I allowed to say that here?) in Shadyside.  But still.  I always go out of my way to be polite to them, and I come in nearly everyday, despite the coffee (which I agree is very 'meh'... watery and just basically pretty average, if not slightly below) and HORRIBLE pastries/desserts.  (Seriously, they taste like they've been around since the place opened.)  But never a flash of recognition, of any sort of 'hey this girl's usually pretty nice and polite so maybe when she quite benignly asks for a cup of ice in addition to her $4 iced soy-vanilla latte+tip, I shouldn't practically roll my eyes at her.'  Nothing like that.  So, why do I come here everyday?  For the same reason other people must come here, too... the people-watching and melding of inside/outsideness in the place.  It IS pretty lame that the internet isn't free, and especially with how Crazy Mocha has apparently hopped onboard with UPMC to takeover the city, you'd think CTR would at least want to keep up with the competition.  But, with a purchase, you still get 2 hours access, so that does go a bit of a ways in making up for it.  In terms of the wait for tables, I've never found it to be quite as bad as a few on here have said.  I've never had to wait longer than 3 or 4 minutes for a table, and especially if you're by yourself and only have a book or something, people are generally pretty nice about letting you share their table until one opens up.    So, in summary, if you are a coffee snob, this probably isn't your place... if you're any other kind of snob, though, make sure you walk by the place a few times with your oversized sunglasses, gladiator sandals, & Sephora bag, carrying your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy in your purse, so us scrubby kids taking up tables in the Coffee Tree have a chance to gawk at you for awhile."}
{"text":"I absolutely love CoffeeTree but this location is a let down. It's a hybrid, sharing space with the Bagel Factory. If bagels are your thing, you'll like this place. Id rather have the usual CoffeeTree assortment of pastries. This location couldn't even make a frozacino. Had to go across the street to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This chain has some of the best coffee in Pittsburgh and their rewards with the LoyalTree app can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great Coffee and the selection of fresh coffee was terrific. The Coffee master that was in the store helped me select the right coffee to take home. Nice to find location in my business travels that show people who enjoy their work."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for coffee tree roasters! visited the place in July 2009.  although i only got a soda juice from there.  it was still good on a hot summer day.  other friends ordered coffee.  seem like they liked it.  but i think it's a great place to hang out, relax, read a book or do work.  there are even big couches in the back."}
{"text":"There's not a ton of difference between this place and other coffee tree sites. I thought this was nice, though. In particular they have some great outdoor space, even with music on some weekend afternoons, as far as I have seen. The hummus and carrots were a little disappointing, but all of the coffee drinks (hot and cold) I got here were great. I frequented them during a several-night hotel stay across the parking lot. And speaking of parking lot, that's another perk. I was able to have a friend drive to meet me here, and not have to worry about parking. A definite plus!"}
{"text":"Cozy place. Good coffee. The pastries always seem to be old when I order them. They look so tempting in the window but often disappoint. Skip the iced coffee there as well."}
{"text":"Not in the mood for my regular (Large soy vanilla latte) I asked what the best drink they had on the menu.  I was immediately told that the Cortado was.   Despite some friendly and courteous disagreement between the gentlemen behind the counter I decided on trying the Cortado.  Absolutely delicious. Thank you for the recommendation, and the fun experience."}
{"text":"Coffee is mediocre, but the pastries are excellent. A nice quiet shop in Mt. Lebanon and the atmosphere is great to get some work done."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop. Definitely recommend the medium iced caramel latte with an extra shot. There is a garage door wall that lifts, providing fresh air and a nice open concept and vibe. It is located in a really lively area on Walnut street with plenty of dining and shopping around and open late (until 11 PM) for you night owls like me!"}
{"text":"Stale coffee. The cups have weird lids that are hard to drink from. It might be that it is after 7 pm but I was hoping for some semi fresh coffee."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to the Coffee Tree, I am continually amazed at how disgusting the food is. I frequent the one on Walnut street where none of the food or pastries are fresh. I though the food at the S. Craig street store would be different, but i've been there twice and the food tastes gross. I'm eating an egg salad sandwhich wrap and the wrap tastes nappy and the egg salad tastes old. They charged me an extra .50 for a piece lettuce, .50 for a cucumber, and .50 for a tomato."}
{"text":"I've worked on Walnut street for several years and decided today to give this place another try. Strangely, sadly, the experience was the same: staff who barely look at you, certainly aren't going to deign to give you a smile. Coffee is fine, but I find that Starbucks of Walnut (on Bellefonte) has the most consistently pleasant people working there.  This Coffee Tree has the fewest smiles/barista I've ever encountered, so they might consider looking for people who give a darn, when they interview."}
{"text":"Huge! That's about where the positives stop. Wifi is spotty. Espresso is pretty bad. Food/pastry selection is limited and mediocre."}
{"text":"Terrible coffee. Great space.   If you're actually looking for a good coffee, espresso, latte, etc., I would highly recommend trying somewhere else. If you just want a nice bright place to sit and do some work, this spot is great."}
{"text":"Good espresso drinks every time. The staff is friendly. It's a good place to feed my caffeine addiction."}
{"text":"This gets 4 stars for being a great study/chill out environment. 1. On warm days, they'll elevate the entire store front window and make it into an open air cafe. Needless to say, tables by the window are taken up quickly. 2. They have couches and tables deeper in, and at the very back of the cafe, right by the bathrooms, they have a sound-proof glass enclosed study area which I assume you can book for meetings. 3. Shadyside has free wireless. 4. I bump into study partners, lab mates, and once my adviser (Hi CG!). And every time I go, I get a ridiculous amount of work done. 5. When I don't want to work, I like to eavesdrop. People have some of the best conversations. Perhaps I've said too much already...  Here's what I like about the consumables: 1. They sell serendipity loose leaf teas and they put out samples that you can smell. 2. They sell coffee beans by the pound and half-pound. There's usually at least one knowledgeable staff member around to tell you about what beans they have to offer. You can buy whole bean or pre-ground. They give you free coffee scoops and the bag is pretty enough to make the coffee a good gift. 3. I like to get the coffee-of-the day. Ask to see if its chilled or hot. If you drink it in the store, you can get one free refill.  4. The pastries are hit and miss. Also, they are too expensive for my tastes. The croissant I had was stale. The cakes were better, but not worth the price. I would go to Prantl's and get a pastry for your coffee."}
{"text":"Their caffe mocha is quite good. It's often crowded  over the weekend so finding a spot to charge might be hard. Wish they could switch their music to something more jazzy. Still love this place though since they are friendly, allow dogs but still pretty clean."}
{"text":"I love visiting this coffee shop after a long run. I have had several things that are excellent, but today I'm just having a cool, refreshing iced tea!"}
{"text":"While visiting Squirrel Hill, I had a serious need for coffee and my friends directed me straight to The Coffee Tree Roasters. I had an iced coffee with caramel and it was amazing - not too sweet, strong enough and they have the front window removed for easy access to the summer breeze and people-watching on Forbes. Very nice."}
{"text":"Raspberry Mocha makes me happy. Super rich and delicious."}
{"text":"The coffee here is excellent. I usually have their iced or hot mochas which are extremely rich and chocolatey.  Their lattes and regular coffee blends are also quite nice and their chai lattes can be light and refreshing.   The decor is very chill traditional coffee house style with small tables and a good amount of space considering the other neighborhood shops. The brick interior is cozy  and cool and they open the front garage door-style window on nice days so it's practically like you're out on the street.   Very cool place to just chill and do homework or meet with friends. Parking can be difficult, though.   Slightly disappointed by the quality of their pastries though so I usually just grab a yogurt."}
{"text":"CTR has always been one of my favorite coffee shops in Pittsburgh.   The coffee is always fresh and strong. Plus they have some cool unique brews from around the world as well as a plethora of teas.   The atmosphere and service is always great, but the one thing that puts this place over the top is the hours. Unlike many shops that close at 5-6pm, CTR is often open until 11pm, making it a place I frequent for late night work or meet ups with long lost friends. There are plenty of tables plus free wifi!"}
{"text":"They're a great local alternative to Starbucks, and they make kickass drinks! I've had mochas here, hot and cold, and chai tea lattes here, hot and cold. All were delicious, about the same price as you would find at Starbucks, but they have those cute little stickers for decorating your cup and I'm all about the stickers. They're usually seasonally themed and are always adorable. It's the little things, people."}
{"text":"The best coffee i have had in PGH! It's smooth and delicious and the best part of waking up before work. plus the staff is amazing and provide stickers for you :)"}
{"text":"The vanilla lattes are a little sweet, but delicious. This place is perfect when the weather is nice and they can open the garage door. It's definitely a must-visit coffee shop on Walnut."}
{"text":"Great service, great coffee!  I just ordered a spectcular breve lattee and it delivered! I get that this is a crowded spot, often times they rush drinks and all--but if you catch them when they don't have a line out the door... It is well worth it! I'm a fan, coming back again and again... when there is NOT a line out the door!"}
{"text":"I was walking around and decided to try this place out. I asked for a recommendation on a type of ground coffee to take home. The ladies where very helpful and knowledgable. I love the coffee. Thank you."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet neighborhood coffee bar.  However, the elementary school a block away gets out at 3:25, and from 3-4 it can be crowded with moms and younger siblings stopping in to pass the time.  Outside those times, it's always quiet with nice music and delicious pastries."}
{"text":"Internet Connection  = $60  Wi-Fi router = $120  Daily internet pass = $4.95  Losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.  $4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.  If you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside is a great place to go to do work or meet up with friends. There is a lot of seating with a variety of small tables for individuals to work on their laptops, couches for people to lounge on, and even a closed off area for study groups to work at. The atmosphere of the Shadyside Coffee Tree is fantastic and they even open up the main window at the entrance when the weather is nice. The coffee there is decent. I personally like my coffee very strong and bold-tasting and I find even their stronger brews on the weaker side. However the coffee still tastes pretty good and it's nice that they offer free refills if you get regular coffee for-here. My only issue with the Shadyside Coffee Tree Roasters is that the space fills up very fast. There have been times where I wanted to come here for coffee and wasn't able to because every table was occupied. Most times, I've had to hover over tables like a preying vulture when it looks like people are about to leave. Overall, I like Coffee Tree Roasters and would go again to either study or hang with friends."}
{"text":"If I could give them 6 stars, I would.  We love Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee with a passion and The Coffee Tree Roasters always has amazing beans.  There was a mix up with our reservation this week and we were so disappointed that we wouldn't have the Jamaica for the upcoming holiday.  Christina made it right and found us the two pounds that we asked to be reserved.  We are grateful and very happy customers!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop gets my endorsement because the cappuccino is perfect. Just like Italy. And the style and atmosphere are close to a European coffee shop too. A great selection of coffee wares- brewing systems etc."}
{"text":"It's very inconsistent here in terms of barista skills, unfortunately. Sometimes I get a great latte, sometimes a shitty, overly foamy latte (like today). It's also has a very corporate feel -- products, products everywhere. It could be so much better, and I really wish it was, since it's so close to home.  UPDATE: I should probably review this place when I have a good experience, but I'm here  again today and having a negative one, so take that for what it is (I'm fixated on the negative, this place continues to be inconsistent, and when it's good it never raises to the level of motivating me to write a  really positive review, which I'm perfectly capable of doing.) Today I came in and was standing alone at the register and at least 3 employees looked at me without so much as smiling let alone saying \"hello\" or \"we'll be with you in 2 secs.\" It's customer service 101, people. Then I got a shitty latte served on a dirty saucer. So, I'm ready to reduce my review by a star, but I'll refrain for now."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a good cup of coffee and asked about some of their different types of brewing methods that you can purchase for home. I talked with Serafina regarding what her opinion was expecting a part-timer who just works occasionally. But I was so surprised and impressed with her knowledge of all of their products and coffee in general. My coffee today was great and I learned a lot at my visit. Now to research the brew methods! Thanks Serafina!!"}
{"text":"I have to drop this down a star because I continue to get frustrated with the bad Wifi here (and the two hour restriction).  I also recently came in here to buy a coffee and cookie- and the cookie was over $3 (and not that good).  For any baked goods, walk across the street to Prantyl's- which is cheaper and the goodies are much better."}
{"text":"This place is not my favorite CTR, and CTR coffee is not my favorite; therefore, by inductive reasoning I can't give this branch more than 3 stars (is that right?).  Anyway, this branch is located in the beautiful Bakery Square and the building is unique in that it is its own separate entity right dab in the middle of the parking lot.  Once inside, the shop itself feels very open, which feels odd in a coffee shop because there are no cool nooks and crannies to nestle into to find your own zone for working or chillaxin with peeps. That being said, the people here are very nice and the coffee is pretty good. Worth a stop in if you're to/from the gym here or doing some shopping."}
{"text":"yum yum yum. the coffee here is so good and tasty. They are now open until midnight! And they have a meeting room in the back that you can reserve for various meeting-type needs. awesome! I recommend the White Frozaccino frozen coffee drink in the summer."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and friendly staff. Major downer is their nonfunctional wifi, which is admittedly the draw for many students.  Wifi, which is offered, is not functional, and they make no attempts to fix it despite multiple customers raising the issue. The cashiers and baristas seem oblivious to the issue, and sadly, most patrons are currently making use of the next door Sephora wifi, which is spotty at best."}
{"text":"I have had coffee all over Pittsburgh. There is a CTR near my office. Atmosphere is typical chain-style with an artsy feel. This may be a local chain, but it still presents similar to Starbucks. All of the baked goods are shipped in even though they are displayed like they are made in-house.  The prices of their pounds of coffee are much more expensive than my favorite shop by about $5 per pound. Even the cups of coffee are more expensive than Zeke's. My husband got a light roast regular coffee that was stronger than most dark roasts I drink. I got a Caff√® mocha that was really nothing special  compared to ones I have had other places."}
{"text":"I so enjoy the coffee! Great treats to eat too! One of the best coffee shops around!!"}
{"text":"Better coffee and oatmeal than the corporate behemoth down the street. The WiFi works fine for me, I'm sitting at the table right by the entrance and getting 7.8MBps download and 3.5MBps upload (ran speedtest) with the place 75% full. Great decor and open window too, will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pittsburgh coffee shop is Coffee Tree Roasters!¬†¬†There are multiple locations, but I frequent Walnut St. and Bakery Square - both in Shadyside!¬†¬†For high quality coffee at a reasonable price (we all know our caffeine addiction isn't cheap!), this is the place to go.¬†¬†Friendly baristas, drinks made correctly, and coffee bar even featuring simple syrup.¬†¬†You had me at hello, CTR!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Coffee Tree Roasters for their unique ambiance and great beverages. I thought I would stop by their new Bakery Square store to catch up on email between meetings. The Apple Chai Latte was amazing with all of the flavors of fall in one cup. I highly recommend it.  My biggest disappointment was the Buffalo Chicken Wrap I bought to help tide me over before dinner. There was no price on the packaging or in the cooler case. I was shocked to find it was $6.50. I am willing to spend that kind of money for a wrap in most cases. However, this wrap didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great Barristas. Great coffee. Locally roasted. Forget those uptown coffee shops. Go downtown Mt. Lebo for the best all around coffee house experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been in this Coffee Tree location. It's in a great location sandwiched between restaurants and cute boutiques. The place has been very clean both times I have been there. They have outdoor seating when its actually warm out.  They have a nice display of pastries and friendly staff.  I had my usual go to which is a chai tea latte with soy milk. It was tasty.  Parking is metered along the street. They look like old meters but you can use coins or a credit card. Don't let it scare you away!"}
{"text":"My husband and I don't often come to Coffee Tree Roasters because there aren't any locations conveniently located near us, but they do make our favorite Pumpkin Spice latte in Pittsburgh. So we try to go in the fall, and we stupidly picked a Saturday afternoon. We ordered and got our lattes in mugs... The place is huge, so we figured despite all the college kids and their MacBooks, we'd be able to find a spot to squeeze in. Literally every single chair was taken, so we had to ask for cups and dump our once-a-year fall treat inside and then leave. It was really disappointing. While it's totally not the fault of the coffee shop, there were tons of students taking up 3-5 seats on couches with their one body, students taking up multiple person tables for their one body, and even students sleeping on tables and couches. I just graduated grad school a couple months ago, so I'm not an old cranky person from the suburbs who doesn't understand a college town... I am a young person who wishes Pitt students would be a little more respectful and less self-centered in public spaces. So I only knocked off one star because our coffee is still very very good and the workers were pretty friendly and patient considering."}
{"text":"It's a great place to not only stop by when you're shopping on Walnut St. It's also a great place to study or get some work done. Their coffees are always legit and they will get your order made quickly.  There's a small study room in the back, leather couches are available, and small tables everywhere. In the summer they will open the glass wall/windows so you can feel the breeze and make you feel like you're sipping on your coffee outdoors.  One downside about this place is, the restroom is so dirty and smelly. Maybe it's because they have too many customers but I really wish the staff would get the cleaning done right. Bad restrooms give customrers a bad impression!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Ordered chai tea latter. It was gross. Tasted like tap water.  I'd come back for the ambiance but not so much for the drinks."}
{"text":"The cappuccino is okay, slightly better tasting than starbucks though not any stronger (though presumably higher quality).   The location is nice and tranquil, so decent to study at, but parking in the adjacent garage is a 3 hour maximum, so your time is restricted."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday afternoon after living in the neighborhood or a while. Can't say I was disappointed or overly impressed. Ordered a cappuccino and a lemon poppyseed biscotti - both were standard! Extra star for the atmosphere of the cafe. It had comfy seating both at tables and small couches and a big window perfect for people watching on Walnut Street. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a simple, uncomplicated  coffee shop experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am a Pitt student and come here often to do homework, study, etc. The atmosphere is perfect for socializing or studying. It is a big space that always has plenty of room. Their cold brew iced coffee is amazing and sometimes they give free refills on it too."}
{"text":"This is really good coffee and service! I live near by, so my morning starts there usually nice and careful personal, always polite and cute...thanks guys! You are the best"}
{"text":"This is a great place to just hang out and study.  The \"regulars\" are nice people.  Unfortunately, you do have to buy something to use the internets."}
{"text":"Such a fan of this place. And they have a great fireplace in the corner. I ordered a roasted white mocha and sat in the corner near the fireplace. I was so comfortable and relaxed. It was on a Saturday morning and it wasn't as packed as it normally is.   Right in the heart of bakery square. Parking can be a pain so you might have to park in the garage, but get here early and you should be fine.   Prices are comparable to Starbucks, staff was polite and helpful. Go and get you a cup o' Joe at this place!"}
{"text":"Is a \"Shot in the Dark\"* a Pittsburgh thing?  Anyone?  I'd never heard of it before visiting this city, but it was on every menu at every coffee joint we rolled into on our trip.  The one at Coffee Tree Roasters was excellent, at any rate.   The baristas were nice and efficient.  Prices were fair.  The place was packed.  It's modern and clean with a fa√ßade that is open to Walnut.  Otherwise, it's a coffee place.  And that's all I have to say about that.  *For us non-Pittsburghers, this drink is a brewed coffee with a double shot of espresso."}
{"text":"The service here is friendly and prompt and the coffee is delicious. My friends and I had a great time gathering here and continue to do because it's comfortable and inviting. It was a cold and wet day so the fireplace being on was an added bonus. While it's a busy location, it never feels overcrowded. In nice weather, the outdoor seating options are wonderful! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The speciality coffee drinks are tasty and the atmosphere is always welcoming. I especially like the Walnut coffee shop due to their high volume quick service. The place is spacious and can relax or get some work done. It's always kid friendly, as I see kids often here. The price of their bulk coffee beans is pretty expensive, and the only thing I'm not a huge fan of but not a deal breaker is their plain coffee, yet they have good syrups to flavor them up."}
{"text":"Coffee Uhhh. OK.  Location great for people watching. Not helping by limiting internet to 2 hours. Staff in Sq. Hill fair to good. But to serve coffee and greet people. It's not that hard.  They don't clean up much. Until the end of the night. Pastries pretty spendy. Try not to ask too many questions you may be bothering them to talk to a customer."}
{"text":"OMG. Mr. Barista. Your not in Seattle. I Live Pacific Northwest.  I'm not a coffee snob I can do with it or without it. But it seemed like I was absolutely bothering the staff this morning. Check the date.  Ordered mocha and a scone.  And got a look.  I'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear. Felt like I was in someone else's hood.  Get over yourselves people.  Your in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Coffee is worse than the commonplace coffee shop across the street. Limited seating. Wifi time limit. No comforting typical coffee shop atmosphere."}
{"text":"The space is very large, with seating in the front and back, so it is ideal for studying for college and grad students. Not my favorite coffee in the city, but my favorite drink on the menu is the hot apple grogge seasonal in fall and winter. You can add caramel as well if you're feeling decadent. It's the perfect warming drink, with plenty of spice notes. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I like this location of CTR. I like stopping by after I go to the gym (if I am lucky enough to get a parking spot) or before a Trader Joes run. Their coffee is fine, as are their lattes. Nothing spectular. But, during the winter, the Hot Apple Grogge is divine!   The worst part about this location is the parking situation. It seems ridiculous to have to park in a parking garage when you just want to grab a quick coffee. People never pay attention/obey the hybrid parking signs, so even when I am driving my hybrid, I still normally can't get a decent parking spot.  They do have a selection of gluten free options, which is nice.  They carry Umpqua oatmeal as well as some gf bars and a few treats from Gluuteny."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the people! Love the environment. Love the coffee x800000o. Good perks program. Good pastries."}
{"text":"This seems like a really cool place with the floor to ceiling windows that roll-up when the weather is nice.  Nevertheless, I give this place 3 stars for a couple reasons.  First, the hot chocolate (my drink of choice) was a bit dull tasting.  Second, finding seating when the weather sucks is difficult.  I hear the coffee lovers do enjoy this place though.  Check it out and see if it's for you."}
{"text":"I was a fan for years of the Coffee Tree in spite of the lack of seating due to endless working students with laptops. I changed my mind when twice in  a row when I asked for a spare paper cup to split my coffee with my wife I was told -- we dont do that. Starbucks does and is a lot friendlier. I hate to down local companies but Coffee Roasters is acting like a franchise not a local coffee shop."}
{"text":"Large, spacious, and study-friendly, with great coffee and pastry selection.  I love that they have the open garage door which lets in a lot of natural light on a sunny day, and the assortment of chairs, tables, benches, and couches means you get your pick.   The crowd is varied but a large part of the crowd seems to be doing work or studying.  A great place to chat, people watch, do homework...anything, pretty much.    The drip coffee is actually quite good, and if you want something sweet and frozen, they have frapp-like drinks as well.  Behind the second counter, you can get whole beans."}
{"text":"Coffee tree is my favorite around!! I personally like my coffee hot!, When my coffee is handed to me , I'm never disappointed like other places. My only wish is that there'd be one in the Robinson area...I don't get to Beverly Rd as much as I used to."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get coffee in Squirrel Hill. It's quite a bit smaller than the location in Shadyside; limited seating inside and a few tables outside seem to always have someone smoking at them.  Large selection of beans for sale, although none of them are certified organic and only one or two are fair trade. WiFi is available, although an annoying login procedure is required and I haven't had luck with it working on my iPhone."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to the Starbucks down the street. This location is fairly large with couches & comfy chairs in the back by the fire. Their coffee is better than average, and the baristas have been friendly. A nice place to hang out on weekend mornings. If you don't find anything yummy to eat here, try the bakery across the street before grabbing your coffee."}
{"text":"I am sad to report, there is an insect problem. The muffins and sweets in the glass case are crawling with fruit flies or something similar.   When my colleague brought this to the attention of the employee behind the counter, he said \"we are doing all we can.\"  So they know about this problem and are still selling these items?    This is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, surprisingly spacious. Convenient location. Great background music/noise for relaxing or getting some work done. Cute holiday decorations. Friendly employees. Lots of different seating options.  Truthfully, I only came here because there was a water advisory and Starbucks was closed. I got a caffe mocha, which I enjoyed. Prices similar to Starbucks. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"New location in Bakery Square. Nice outdoor seating, and a fireplace inside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get coffee. Hands down. I have loved every drink I have ever gotten here, and the staff is always very friendly. If the shop were easier to sit down, relax, and enjoy the coffee in, this would easily be 5 stars. Still, nice people and amazing coffee!"}
{"text":"I love coffee shops. Coming from New York City and having spent a lot of time in Europe you can imagine coffee shops are a mainstay. What makes a good coffee shop? One of the key ingredients is coziness. I love cozy and that's what the coffee shop experience provides for me.  This truly makes The Coffee Tree Roasters in SHY my go to coffee shop. Not only is it nicely situated in a great part of town with ample (free) parking on the inner tree lined streets of this cute neighborhood but it also has a great garage-door-esque pull up window which is great for an outdoor effect when the weather permits - about two months out of the year (insert lol emoji).   The warm fireplace in the back surrounded by comfy couches and chairs and many desks make this the perfect place to study, read, relax and kickback, chat or even a first date/meet for coffee. I love the ambience and that gives it a four star.  If I had to rate solely on the drinks, I would give it a 3.5 but I think this goes for a lot of coffee shops who eventually branch out and acquire some fame to them. The place is busy, no doubt, so it's difficult to concoct the perfect caf√© drink (ie La Prima in the strip or Big Dog in Southside).   Now, I am not a coffee snob nor am I a connoisseur , but I do know a lil' bit. What I can say is the selection of coffee beans to take home are fantastic.   Their baked goods are actually pretty delicious and certainly go well with their beverages. They do have a \"starbucks\" esque \"frozen/gourmet\" beverage list, and I have to say their seasonals are my favorite! However, I am more of an espresso/cortado man myself and stick to these wherever I go.   Overall, great spot for the aforementioned activities, perfect ambience, open pretty late, plenty of outlets, 2 hour free Wi Fi, and the perfect ambience. They play great tunes too!  Only vices are the fact that it can get unpredictably packed (worse times would be Sat/Sun 10 am to about 2 am), and then anytime around 3 pm on most school days or weekdays.  But overall, my favorite coffee shop to spend more than an hour or so in! I actually like the look and feel of this one compared to the others (Mt. Lebanon, Squirrel  are the ones that come to mind)"}
{"text":"Great spot to study, caffeine up, write yelp reviews or have first dates. I love the Shadyside location with it's garage door window and the team room and couches towards the back. The coffee drinks are good, not as much variety as for instance a Starbucks, but better. However, please check your snacks, I had a pretzel chocolate cookie and the pretzel pieces were stale.  Very chill vibe and you get 2 hours of free wifi. However, you only get 2 hours of wi-fi... The other locations are fine, Bakery square has good outdoor seating perfect for good weather, squirrel hill is alright. Shadyside is, however, my favorite. They also have the most extensive Tea selection.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The coffee here is tasty and the place is open late.  They also have a nice open air scene going when the weather is nice"}
{"text":"This place is just want West Mifflin needed- there are NO other coffee shops in the area, basically! This place is beautiful- I love the open windows, the fireplace, the cozy chairs.. it's great! The staff was wonderful when we visited and my iced tea was yummy. My boyfriend liked his cold brew coffee as well. The only thing is I wouldn't necessarily recommend studying here if you need a very quiet spot- it's all in one space and the coffee machines are pretty loud. But if you're looking for a cute place to read a book or catch up with a friend, it will work great!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great coffee.  I like supporting a local company, especially when the product is such high quality.  This is a very relaxing place to meet someone for coffee."}
{"text":"Solid coffee spot in Shadyside. Location wise, it's very convenient for me, as it's close to my work. If I'm looking for somewhere to meet a colleague that's outside of work, I often choose a coffee shop and this has been a great place for such meetings. There is plenty of seating available. The couches are comfortable and are usually the first seats I grab. The fact that the windows open is just wonderful on a beautiful day. However, I find the coffee to be just A-Ok. It isn't anything special or unique, but it's absolutely not bad. I recommend visiting if you are looking for a place to meet a friend or colleague to converse or even looking for a nice place to read/study. I don't recommend visiting if you're looking for a coffee drink that will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"As always, I got the basic Vanilla Latte- it's the drink that I get to measure all the coffee places.  I figure, if they can get the drink to be sweet enough and yet have the right amount of espresso, they can't be all that bad.  The latte art is always a plus, as well.  It was $3.10, pretty usual price.  It was well-made, a little on the sweet side.  But definitely okay.  I will most certainly come back here to do some work or to journal...  Coffee Tree Roasters caught my eye as I walked down Walnut Street because the entire front of the shop is open-air.  There's about three sections for seating and there were plenty of outlets.  It was a bit warm and stuffy inside (this is in early Sept).  The service is fairly fast but I think a lot of people come here as their haunt so it might be difficult to find a spot."}
{"text":"For coffee, studying / homework, and what appeared to be plenty of first dates Coffee Tree Roasters on Walnut was non-stop busy the day I was there. I went to get some work done and avoid the rain and luckily was able to find a seat next to an electrical outlet.   Downfall - the wifi was out. Luckily the girl next to me know that a neighboring business had an open wifi that was strong enough to connect to!  The space is plenty big and always full - so plan to be flexible if you are looking to set up shop like I was!"}
{"text":"I love coffee and any place that serves it. Shadyside is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, especially on a Saturday afternoon. It's very alive and animated with people everywhere! I personally love window shopping at the Apple Store, but that's a different story.   My girlfriends and I met on Saturday for a little shopping and lunch, and while we were waiting for our one friend, we hopped into the Coffee Tree for a morning tea. They have an awesome tea selection, and I had their organic citrus green tea. The layout is great inside - a lot of tables, and outlets for the laptop users. Up one level, they have couches by a fireplace, and finally in the back they have a closed-in meeting room available for groups. Great location - great tea. It was perfect for the brisk, sunny Saturday morning walk down Walnut."}
{"text":"A shattered iPhone screen brought me to the Apple Store in Shadyside yesterday.  I was in desperate need of both carbs and caffeine by that point in the day, and the Apple Genius helpfully recommended Coffee Tree just a few storefronts down.  A lot of the complaints I'm reading are valid.  The baristas were a bit awkward and the layout is a little odd.  That said, my latte was on point and my cookie-- some ridiculous combination of chocolate chip, oatmeal and pretzel pieces-- hit the spot.  Prices were fair, I found a comfy chair by the fireplace, and the free wifi worked reasonably well.  There's probably fancier and comfier places around, but this is a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"In many years of frequenting Shadyside, I had never tried this establishment.  Having braved snow to get to yoga on a Saturday morning, after neglecting to check the web for cancellations, I needed to find a men's room.  Coffeetree was one of the few stores opened and were accommodating.   They also poured me a large cup of coffee gratis.  Five stars for employees who make it to work in a snowstorm and retain their cheerfulness and empathy for others."}
{"text":"Mom and I had a girl's day out at the movies yesterday, and despite the 61C and a few other places being closer to the Manor, we decided to come here.  It's always a little dicey trying to get a table here, 'cos the place is a little on the cozy side.  But we did get a table and my Cafe Americano was just perfect and Mom loved her latte.    One small complaint though.  I wish they'd update their website.  It't a single page and just gives you their locations.  It doesn' say anything about their coffees or merchandise."}
{"text":"This is your typical coffee tree roasters. It comes complete with the garage door in the front that is open during the warmer months to allow a nice breeze inside the cafe.   I don't come here often, if I am honest with you. Primarily because their espresso could be improved upon. If I do get something with espresso then I typically add some flavor or milk to make it taste better. I will say though that a plain cup of coffee here is great. Right now I am enjoying the pumpkin chai charger, which is surprisingly very pumpkiny.  They have significantly more seating than some of the other coffee shops on Forbes in squirrel hill. So if you want to sit down and sip your coffee, there is a good chance you can get a seat here.  Their hours are very long, I think they are open until 10 or 11pm most nights which is great. I regularly see book clubs and support groups meeting here to chat which I think is awesome.   If you want to try here, then I suggest coming soon before their fall drinks are gone."}
{"text":"A cozy place to sit n do your studies or chit chat over a cup of coffee. A great place to relax! Very warm n comfortable n the best part is it stays open till midnight :)"}
{"text":"Great place to study considering I've spent entire afternoons and evenings there cramming for exams. The staff is really friendly and if you get a ceramic mug refills for coffee are free!"}
{"text":"I ordered a small cappuccino with a salted caramel flavor shot and was severely disappointed. As soon as I held the cup, it was clear that it was mostly foam. This was only confirmed when I took off the lid. The cappuccino itself was poorly made, with all of the syrup resting on the bottom. Although it was only $3.10, it still did not seem worth it considering the amount of actual coffee I got.   Otherwise, the atmosphere of this cafe is nice. There are plenty of tables to work at, so you can be sure to find students here. I would probably come back here to work, but not for the coffee."}
{"text":"The drinks here are okay and the baked goods are mediocre (one employee even told me herself not to bother with them). The real highlight of this caf√© is its ambiance and ample seating, which makes it a nice place hang out and work. It's usually pretty full, but it has a good balance of chill and that nice caf√© background noise that keeps things from feeling too dead. You'll see many people camping out here with their laptop, armed with a nice warm drink.  So if you're looking to get some work done but don't want to coop yourself up at home, this is a great option!  I also like that they update their special drinks menu regularly to keep things fresh and match the season."}
{"text":"I live right across the street, but I just recently noticed that this was right across the street. I only tried an iced coffee, but it tasted fresh. A little on the pricey side, but that's to be expected. The large front window was open. A small child tried to climb through it as I sat next to it. When I first got there, it was very busy. Most of the crowd thinned out quickly, though. Overall, I'll be going back to try more drinks."}
{"text":"It's a popular place to hang out on Walnut st, more so than the Starbucks three blocks away, tucked on a side street. Hence, this place is busy, all day long, any day of the week. I never figured out their wifi, apparently you are supposed to ask the barista for a piece of paper with the wifi info. I just connected to the free wifi from Sephora right next door, no problem, no time limit. Their study room seems to operate on some sort of sign up basis. I've only been there outside someone's slot but its quite a bit quieter than the outside. Not a big coffee fan, I usually go there only to get stuff done so I order like an iced tea or sth."}
{"text":"They take forever to make your coffee. I also think they are extremely overpriced. The drinks aren't bad but they aren't worth the price you pay for them.  Waiting ten minutes for a drink is insane though and that's how long it takes.  It's one thing if they have a lot of orders coming in. I would never complain if they were busy, but every time I have been there, there's been maybe one or two people in front of me and it takes forever."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse and worse.    I've been in Pgh for a while now and honestly, I can't remember a time when I didn't go to Coffee Tree Roasters on Walnut as my go-to study/sit around/meeting place.  I loved the big garage door, the ambiance, the people watching, the free wifi...etc..etc.  The coffee was good and reasonably priced, with tea at hand if I felt like it.  Since then the quality of the place and service has just plummeted.  Started with the bathrooms...rarely cleaned, rarely working.  Nowadays, if you dare to sit in the back near the bathrooms, the whole area reeks of stale urine or something.  It smells like the bathroom.  Inside, the toilets are leaky, the floors are often COVERED in water (lets hope) and paper...I partially blame the patrons for leaving these in such poor condition, but hey, management, could you possibly, i dunno...clean it?  I've gone a couple times in one day, once in the morning, and once after classes, and the bathrooms look exactly the same.    Then the service declined.  First they started making the \"you must buy something to get internet.\" That's fine with me.  I always buy something there.  But then they started the 2hr limit...then free 2hrs, but then you have to buy something ELSE on top of whatever you bought initially...etc...etc.  Now half the time the internet doesn't work and no one on staff seems to care or know how to reset it.  They just look at you like you are lying about the internet because, hey, they saw someone using what looked to be the internet about 8hrs ago...or that's what their coworkers told them yesterday.  Then the coffee also became watered down...and went up a smidge in price.  Still cheaper than SBux but its...not as quality anymore.    I still love it for the giant door into people watching in shadyside and its locale. But otherwise, it could be a lot better...because it USED to be a lot better."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop! The girls and guys who work here are super friendly. I typically get a soy latte but I occasionally try one of their sessional specialties. Everything has been REALLY good. Way better than the popular big chain coffee shops. Their pastries are always changing and look delicious. Great atmosphere for a meeting or just reading a book. When the weather is warm, they have a huge front window that they open up and let the fresh air in. They also have coffee grounds and tea for sale. I would definitely recommend checking out this place."}
{"text":"CTR is your Pittsburgh-local Starbucks alternative. They roast their own beans which is great, but my own impression is that they've been at it for so long that they're stuck in the prescribed-profile roasting philosophy. That may be a misconception, but when/wherever I see a Dark Roast option, I get that impression. Plus, they seem to be roasting in larger bulk that I would expect one to be able to produce using a true-to-bean method.   [Stepping down off my coffee high horse] This location in particular is a great stop if you're racing out of Pittsburgh on Penn Ave trying to hit the turnpike before rush hour or waiting for your wife to finish her business at Anthropologie [ you know, like you do ]."}
{"text":"Maybe I just do Coffee Tree Roasters wrong, but I have only had lackluster drinks with this chain.  I ordered a hot chocolate this week that was truly dreadful, and I have no idea what was in it that made it so bad.  So why three stars?  Compared to the significantly better Commonplace Coffee up the street, there are many more seats in here.  There is typically somewhere to sit down.  Plus, the hours for Coffee Tree Roasters are the best.  They open early and stay open late.  Finally, the baristas in Squirrel Hill are pretty friendly and pleasant to make small talk with.  I really wish Coffee Tree Roasters would pull it together quality wise.  Maybe just stick to basic coffee if you come here."}
{"text":"Coffee Tree Roasters is NOT a place to study and get work done.  It's a good place for an hour long meeting or something like that.  It's too loud for work, and the Wifi isn't very good.  Essentially, Coffee Tree Roasters is even more expensive than Starbucks and barely better quality.  I don't get why people go to either chain, but they do.  I also didn't like the set up of this store.  I like the garage door that opens, but it's too long and narrow for my taste.  It's really busy, which is fine, but it feels really busy because people are constantly bumping into you.  I wouldn't suggest coming here, but if someone wanted to meet here, I would not refuse to do so."}
{"text":"Ugh. I'm so sad. There is nothing fresh that comes out of their frozen drinks. If I want juice blended with ice I can do that at home. And save myself 4 bucks."}
{"text":"Despite the fact somehow my Cafe Caramel was almost $6, it was scrumptious (I think she must have charged me the wrong amount as I have never paid that here before and I come here often--- I was in a hurry for work so I did not get to ask questions).    Minus the not so friendly staff, I think they have some of the best bevvies in town so I still need to give them 4 stars. The last three times here, I had the same cashier who just was not pleasant... the barista however, was amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way back home to Buffalo, NY. We were thrilled to see The Coffee Tree Roasters were open late (I think we stopped in around 8:45p) as we always prefer to support local if and when possible. We both ordered a 20oz. Americano and they were incredible; gave us the last bit of energy and enthusiasm to make it home :)"}
{"text":"Good coffee shop with high ceilings and an open front on to the street.  The Americano I had was very well brewed, though the girl behind the counter appeared to be on autopilot, never making eye contact, and had  the automatic cadence of an autoworker on an assembly line.  The art work was well framed and neatly displayed, as was the various mugs, cups, and coffee presses, etc.  The whole place was very clean and open.  The music was the proper volume for background sound without disrupting studying, conversation, or your own thoughts."}
{"text":"The cure for a hangover is... Gatorade, advil, coffee and greasy food. This is the place I went to grab the coffee part of that concoction.   I had heard many good things about coffee tree roasters, but never took the time to venture out and try it. While waiting for my glasses to be finished  I came here. (yea... I broke my glasses and had to get new ones during a hangover, fml) I just ordered a regular coffee but it was great! they only had the bold roast available which was fine. The coffee shop seemed adorably cozy with tables, leather couches ect. This looks like a cool hang out spot. We came here around 7pm and it was crowded, but seating was still available. I can only imagine this place in the AM, during lunch or after work.   Yelp hours are not correct. It says they are open on Satuday til midnight. We came by at 11:30 and they were shut down."}
{"text":"Very good coffee and early hours got me to visit this place a number of times during a recent stay in Shadyside. It's a spacious place, with typical coffeehouse decor and trappings. Much preferred compared with the nearby Starbucks."}
{"text":"I sincerely apologize to the Coffee Tree Roaster employee who became completely agitated by my questions. I am not sorry that I care what I put into my body, so yes it matters to me whether the coconut latte is made with coconut milk vs coconut flavor. And how do you seriously not know the calorie content of any of your drinks? And why did you give me an attitude when I asked???? Thankfully Starbucks is right down the street. They post the calories on the menu and they don't mind questions. Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"(Note:  Kit C.'s review should actually be under the Walnut Street location of C.T. Roasters.  This particular location on Forbes Ave is in Squirrel Hill.)  And onwards!  I worked here in Pittsburgh for a few months and had a blast.  The early morning (i.e., 5:30 AM) wasn't the most desirable, but this place has a really regular crowd with some newbies interspersed here and there.  (It isn't hard to get in with the regulars, either.)  The space at the Squirrel Hill location is a bit limited.  Weather permitting, there are two tables outside, so there's ample opportunity for people watching along this main road in Squirrel Hill--lots of folks stroll by throughout the day.  There are a handful of tables up front and then a handful more back past the coffee bar.  (The store itself is sort of shaped like a long rectangle.)    I was about to give the place four stars when I realized I had no cause to from a customer's perspective, and no cause to from my own, either.  I had a great time working there, but that's not what this review is about.  Let's talk about the place, shall we?  The owners and  manager(s?) LOVE coffee.  They will make (and train their employees to make) fancypants espresso drinks with very high-quality products and have really nice teas on hand, but coffee beans are their strength.  The beans are freshly roasted very frequently, and if you buy whole beans (and choose to have them remain whole or have a staff person grind 'em up), the date of the roasting will be marked on your coffee bag so you know just how fresh it is.  I'd had thousands of cups of coffee before working there and have had hundreds since:  nowhere was it fresher or was the supply better maintained.    The staff is really friendly and tends to remember your order after you've been in just a handful of times.  This notion sometimes frightens me--if the coffee shop boy is remembering my order, does that  mean I need to get a life and/or go to a different joint?  NO, people.  Don't worry about it.  Bask in the pleasure of someone having done this very simple thing for you.  And trust me:  the baristas do NOT find it strange if you come in several times a week.  They don't find it all that weird if you're in several times a day.    I've seen varying comments on the pastries--I think one bakery supplies all the Coffee Tree locations.  I liked the sweets last time I was in town but it's been at least a year for me; perhaps things have changed.    Order your coffee of the day for here and you get it in a porcelain cup, plus you get one free refill!  (A paper cup holds no such joy.)"}
{"text":"Found this place last winter and I'm glad of it. Has a fireplace for the winter, a study room, and decent coffee to boot. Small tea pots available and couches if you are with a group though they have often been full when I go.  Mostly sweets to eat. Very friendly staff that often makes small talk with me- a nice social addition which really adds to the slow study time I've put in here.   A summer plus- large windows in the front open up to make this a great summer, spring, fall hang out spot. Location is close to several places to shop, eat, drink, and if you can get over the totally thick yuppie vibe outside then you have yourself a good coffee shop.  Not a ton of wall plugs for computer work, but enough."}
{"text":"Lots of seating area, open windows and coffee related gifts. I ordered the chai and wanted it without sugar but they gave me a sugar free version with sugar substitute."}
{"text":"The coffee tree roasters at squirrel hill is a really nice place to study around the area! They also have really good iced coffee options and honestly I love their frozacino. It hits the spot in terms of caffeine and in overall taste. Definitely want to visit this location again before leaving"}
{"text":"The Walnut Street location is my favorite of the Coffee Trees because of its big garage-style window front that they open during warm weather. The coffee is good, and the shop is huge, with caf√© seating near the front and comfy couches near the back.   The stickers at the counter for sticking on your coffee cup always make me smile."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for an after-dinner coffee. The girl that was working was kind of .. Not rude, but not really that friendly.. Coffee was good though and love the later hours. I would try it again."}
{"text":"I dunno, I've been here enough times to review the place, but there's not really a whole lot to say.  It's a coffee shop! I never sit in and hang out, I always just stop by for a cup, and usually I go to Jitters instead ::shrug::  I'd have to say that they serve you pretty quickly, though, which is good because it's always hella busy in there!  The big open storefront thing is great on a nice day.  I suppose if the Coffee Tree had a selling point, that'd be it."}
{"text":"Coffee Tree Roasters is home to the best coffee I've had in Pittsburgh. They are a little on the expensive side: think Starbucks, but the taste is on a whole different level.  I like that they seasonally update their drink menu, so there's always something new to look forward to trying.    Their coffee takes me over the moon."}
{"text":"Servers here can be really rude. A barista walks over rather haughtily and says to me while I'm sitting, \"You have to put your shoes back on. Health code.\"   It wasn't even that she said it. It was the way she said it. I won't be back. Going to Commonplace across the street, with my shoes on, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Have become quite a fan of  CTR in the recent months. Since I work closeby I often stop by to get their coffee. Their cortado is really nice too. Decent seating area with reliable wifi connection. The baristas are usually warm, friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"These guys get 5 stars for the pure quality of drinks. A little bit pricier than Starbucks, but not by much.  Try the Campfire Mocha. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"i think this coffee tree is decent. it's larger than the one in squirrel hill, and as of now (feb2015) they're doing some renovations to the seating area in the back. maybe the tables will be less cramped, which i personally felt they were.  other than that, they always have solid drip coffee, espresso drinks, and a wide variety of pastries."}
{"text":"This place has potential, but right now it's pretty gross. Every time I've gone in it's been incredibly crowded with flies everywhere (I had three buzzing around my table at my last visit) and big stains all over the carpet in the quiet room. Meh."}
{"text":"Love this place and love the staff!! I'm a huge fan of family businesses and I personally know Bill and Bill and they are great!!!! Super friendly:) and not to mention the coffee is delish"}
{"text":"This is a decent coffee shop smack in the middle of the happening area of Shadyside. The coffee is not the best in town; it would get 3 stars from me if you consider only coffee quality. They also serve pastries, yogurt, other drinks, and most importantly for me a good variety of all natural oatmeal. They sell coffee and coffee accessories, have free wifi, a reasonable number of electrical outlets, and all the good things a decent coffee shop should have. And, the baristas have always been polite, sometimes even chatty.   What is great about CTR-Walnut is the large sitting area with a high ceiling where they pull up the \"garage\" window when the weather is reasonably nice. Fresh air comes in continuously, and you can enjoy sipping your coffee and getting some work done while watching people pass by on the sidewalk of Walnut Street and in the coffee shop.  In fact, that is exactly what I am doing right now. The coffee shop shines especially during the summer, as a result of the open-air seating in the sitting area close to the sidewalk.   Evenings and weekends can get very crowded and finding a seat in the best parts of the shop can be problematic. The back side of the coffee shop is much less exciting at least for me: not as much fresh air and a low ceiling. Although, they do have a fireplace and seemingly cozy couches in the gray area between the back and the front, which I assume would be great for conversation on a cold winter day with the right set of friends.   That they are open relatively late (until midnight) is a plus... If you consider that late, of course. But you will have to make do with it since the tacit rule in Pgh seems to be \"thou shall not keep a coffee shop open after midnight\" even around college campuses where you are almost guaranteed to get reasonable business if you do a good job. Now, imagine the chutzpah if somebody changed that..."}
{"text":"I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually, I bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me I had a friend with me). When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me!? Really!? Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Finally-in 2013 Pleasant Hills PA has one if what the rest of the world has on every other corner. Great coffee reasonably priced served with a smile .......thanks CTR"}
{"text":"The coffee and service is above average. I give it four stars because it still isn't superb."}
{"text":"I love the coffee tree. I used to work across the street and would pop over daily to get my fix-I miss it so! Making your own coffee in an office building isn't quite the same pick me up.  The coffee is delicious and in my experience, the baristas are friendly and always know what they are doing. I would usually get an almond milk latte and it was always so! good! It is really, really difficult to get almond milk to foam properly like cow's milk does, and it usually just comes out full of bubbles and disappointing. (I used to work at starbucks, and I have an espresso machine at home, but I cannot get the almond milk to cooperate, ever.) Here, it comes out rich and creamy every time! I'm jealous of their skills.  The chai lattes are good as well, but can be a bit overpoweringly sweet if you go with almond milk, as the milk itself is sweetened. Love the bran muffins (fresh) and oatmeal cakes (packaged) available for sale.   The atmosphere is great too, and the location on Beverly Rd makes for a nice outing when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite coffee shop in squirrel hill. Beats the dunkin donuts and Starbucks down the street. Very friendly staff. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Wait. Where are we? There are no local coffee shops out in West Mifflin so when I had to drop off some packages at the local UPS store and saw that there was coffee next store I had to stop in. I ordered a vanilla latte and my husband got a coconut iced coffee and we split a cookie. Now, it's not the most amazing coffee ever, but WAY better than starbucks and worth a stop if you are in the area.   They have one of those front windows that opened the entire length of the wall and it's great for when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Great location, in a very walkable area with a few other food places and shops around. Generally easy enough to park and grab coffee to go easily, but finding parking around the area for more than 2-3 hours is a pain. Good coffee and good selection of random food available. They sell all sorts of coffee making implements as well."}
{"text":"The coffee tasted great but the worker was very standoffish and actually quite rude.  It was 5 minutes to closing time which we didn't even realize and he asked us if we wanted it for here or to go and we said here and then 2 minutes later, the exact second it hit 10 he came over and said \"we are closing\", and not in a very nice way. When we asked about a drink he did not give a clear answer and he overall made the experience very subpar."}
{"text":"The best coffee - there's really not much more to say.  It's a small local chain that can roast locally and deliver it fresh. Starbucks has to remove the volatile oils in the beans that would otherwise go rancid during shipment and storage worldwide.  These are the same oils that are give the coffee flavor, so stop by and enjoy the real thing."}
{"text":"I went here on a date once. Lavender Lemon Chai. Large. It was like heaven in my mouth! I drank the one there and got another one to go. It really is a nice place! A little pricey, but I guess that's just coffee in Pittsburgh :P"}
{"text":"Went with my roommate when we were searching for some nighttime wi-fi (our dorm didn't have it yet, we were desperate).  Wandered over, and were in total awe of the open front to the store and how massive the place is... it just keeps going!  Wow.  We hung out in the quiet room in the back and drank tea (my sencha was you know, nothing special, but delicious as sencha always is).  Since I got tea, I can't attest to the quality of the coffee like some of you might like to hear about.  I can however, state that they don't actually make you pay for wi-fi, you just have to buy a drink.  And what kind of jerk goes to a cafe, uses their wi-fi, and doesn't get a drink?  That's just bad manners, people.  The 2 hour time limit to the internet connection was kind of a bummer (otherwise they'd get 4 stars from me), but we went at 10 pm anyway, so we had 2 hours exactly until closing."}
{"text":"The Coffee Tree in LEBO is a great little spot to hang out, grab a coffee to go, or get a couple pounds of great coffee! Never disappoints"}
{"text":"I spend most of my time here during the week studying and doing school work. It's the best little place to go. Their hot cinnamon tea is delicious."}
{"text":"This is a descent coffee shop. I believe that I have only ever been here on a Saturday when there is a long line to order and all (or nearly all) of the tables are filled. The garage doors on the front of the shop are great when the weather is nice. I have really enjoyed the lattes that I have ordered in the past but was very disappointed in the iced coffee - and the attitude of the barista - I ordered today. Asking for cream and sugar in my iced coffee doesn't warrant an attitude. Plus, the coffee was disappointingly watery and weak."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy loud, cramped coffee shops? If so, this is the place for you. Whether it is 4 PM on a weekday afternoon or evening on a lazy Sunday, this place is always packed like a can of sardines. The coffee is great and the service friendly, but it is evident that you're in Shadyside. For a less crazy feel, head over to their Bakery Square location.  Tip: try their Sumatra blend"}
{"text":"In the summer or early fall, it's a great place to hang out as the windows are open and you can feel the nice breeze.  The service is pretty good and took my order quickly as well as serve it promptly.  The prices are competitive and the muffin was fresh.  Despite being busy, it did not feel overcrowded with their 2 levels of seating.  I also ordered a bag of beans.  They had a vast selection of beans at very good quality and had no problem with a coarse grind for my french press.  Overall, a very solid place for coffee and baked goods."}
{"text":"This was my go-to place for coffee for years but sadly the quality of both the coffee as well as the service have declined recently. I've found that some of the Baristas don't work well together to help each other out at this location so service can be quite slow when there's more than one or two people waiting."}
{"text":"Chain coffee shops aren't usually my jam, but this store always has my brew!  At any time, this location is never too busy but has a decent amount of customers, allowing you to visit quickly and have a great experience.  Most of the baristas are very friendly and willing to share some info about the blends and cold brew.   One of my favorite delightful things about my visits are the stickers at the register...usually left to cover the opening on your hot beverage, but what I use to jazz up my coffee cup. Another is the water pitcher for customers that they have on the coffee prep counter--you can always use a water to hydrate after you drink some coffee. It's the small things!  The selection in the snack case usually looks pretty good, some things looking fresher or more homemade than others. Do yourself a favor and try the banana bread--delish!"}
{"text":"Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!"}
{"text":"i love this place!!!!!!   it is a pretty big cafe shop,and they also have a small room for study discussions and they also have this open place,for people who would like to breathe some fresh air and see people walking outside the street.    I could actually sit outside all day sipping the amazing coffee and dunking their yummy walnut or dark chocolate biscotti .And wooo what makes me love this place more??They have amazingly cute stickers to stick it on your coffee cup.     And yes!! i do enjoy cheap thrills like ,taking a sticker which reads GOBBLE GOBBLE and sticking it on my friends forehead.hahah i did laugh for about 2 minutes. But sadly my friends was definitely not edible !      A great cafe shop in an amazing location and filled with good memories.i love you coffee tree!! *imagines herself hugging a huge tree which bears coffee beans on it* :)  -Smriti"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Coffee Tree. Their coffee is great. service has always been friendly, even when it's super busy due to events at Bakery Square. It's great in the warm months when they open up the roll-up door. Their Frozacino beats that other popular frozen coffee drink ANY day.  I would give them 5 stars except for these points: - Never any seating at this place, particularly in the winter when outdoor seating isn't available. - No changing table in the rest room. - I don't like how the condiment bar is on the opposite end of the store from the pickup counter. That just doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"I remember Coffee Tree when they didn't have that cool door. Areefa's as Common Place used to be called had just opened up and coffee tree was feeling it and touched up the store front, added the cool garage door like they had in their Shadyside location. This location is MUCH smaller than the one in Shadyside which is nice. I always come here to meet up with friends and try something new on their menu which is a little bit more extensive than Starbucks. This place definitely has its regulars so if you go here more than once you'll start recognizing people lol! Oh yeah, and the coffee is good!"}
{"text":"A solid place to start a roadtrip, because everyone knows coffee is as essential as fuel and large bags of candy when starting on a long voyage in the car. We started our day with three Italian roast coffees, all hot delicious as expected. Fast service was key here too, as we parked the U-Haul directly in the midst of Walnut Street traffic.  As an aside, I've been here to study before too - lots of tables, but often wobbly, and there are a lot of people in there who generally look like they are just taking up space and preventing actual patrons from finding a seat. I'm sure this is only magnified during prime study periods, so consider this your words of warning."}
{"text":"Very good coffee latte stop today. Forgot that I been here prior. Excellent everything. Nice fire going. Nice place to hang out if one had time."}
{"text":"Lightly toasted Costa Rica taste really good, with great acidity."}
{"text":"The nicest baristas on the planet. I love the bright, airy space- especially on nice days when they open the huge garage-like glass door. Comfy couches, yummy treats (the sometimes have chocolate covered tortilla chips at the counter- try them!) and the perfect medium soy cap with an extra shot of espresso every time!!!"}
{"text":"Slightly better than Starbucks, but that's not saying much. It's sad to me that someone would open a coffee shop like this. Apparently a while back, someone had a \"brilliant\" idea. \"Hey we should start a coffee chain that's just like Starbucks.\"  So I decide to try a Coffee Tree for once. I walk in, look around, look at the menu... Hmmm. No I'm not interested in a pumpkin, caramel, iced, double, almond frappuccino right now. Sorry, just not interested. So I got a smoothie. It must not have been bad because I don't remember anything about it.   Whatever, there's not a lot of options for coffee in Shadyside. Minus 4 stars for not being much better than Starbucks. An extra star for not being Starbucks."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a cup of coffee, so I come here whenever some of the other coffee joints in Squirrel Hill that I like just a little better are too packed.   There is not a whole lot of seating and the atmosphere is a little bland. It just doesn't put out that creative vibe that I like. The prices are reasonable and the staff attentive and friendly. Ok place, just not my first choice."}
{"text":"Delicious lattes and the customer service is excellent! If you come here at the right time, sometimes there's a live band right outside the coffee shop. Very peaceful atmosphere inside the shop! Scones look delicious but I haven't tried them yet!"}
{"text":"Run-of-the mill coffee spot with one upside. It's open late and good for studying. Free refills if you get the medium coffee in a mug. In the summer, I do like when they open up the big garage door and let the nice breeze in."}
{"text":"+ Latte was excellent, however could have been a bit hotter. + Brick wall interior and garage door front facade. Seems like a great place to frequent in the summer.  - All the foodstuffs is pre-wrapped in saran wrap. My scone was decent, but I was surprised by the price considering how small it was."}
{"text":"good hot drinks, not a fan of the iced coffee. Space is perfect for working or lounging, barista's are all exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax and get a bit of work done. Nothing pretentious, just a very casual atmosphere. The open \"garage door\" store front is a major plus. And the Campfire Mocha will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is really good and it's in a convenient location, but there isn't much seating and the wireless internet doesn't work very well.  The atmosphere is kind of cold rather than the warm cozy feel I like to have in a coffee place."}
{"text":"So great that it's open latttttttte.... Wait! Is that latte or late? lolz, My favorite coffee places are open when you really need that caffeine :D :P"}
{"text":"I am going to start this review by giving you the heads up that I am aware it might be biased towards my European taste from back home, as this place seems to be a popular choice among my non-Portuguese/French/Italian friends: I really thought that the espresso I ordered tasted terrible, as it had certainly been over roasted and I could see some colored reflections on top of the liquid (soap?). Plus, all the baristas seemed like they had been struck by the sadness of a major catastrophe.  With that being said, the place is cozy and the pound cake did taste well, albeit maybe a little bit too sweet..."}
{"text":"I like different coffee shops for different reasons. I come to this particular Coffee Tree more because I like Bakery Square than I like this shop. I will say, the baristas are great here. I am always met with people who are kind and helpful, and it's not the forced kind of kind. They are kind. It's nice.   As fate would have it, I typically come to this Coffee Tree after 7pm on week nights. I love how they are open fairly late (11pm) and how I never have trouble finding a seat! I'm shocked I can always find a seat because it is small in there. But given all the windows/glass, it has an open kind of feel. I like it!    The coffee is cheap AND if you can't find a spot in the lot right outside of the shop in Bakery Square, you can park in the parking garage on the premises for free up to 3 hrs. I mean...that's sweet.   I gave it 3 stars because the ambiance is okay but not excellent. The coffee is okay but not excellent. It's a middle of the road kind of shop. If you're close by, it may be worth a stop, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.   BUT you know as I know that every now and again you need to feel like you work at Google. This shop allows you to work around enough strangers who might think to themselves, \"Do they work at google?\"   That's got to count for something."}
{"text":"I come to this Coffee Tree purely for its ambiance. I give it a 4 star because of its ambiance. There are two levels, and the first level is where you want to sit. Sure, each table wobbles a bit (grab a sugar packet or 2), but the exposed brick and garage door looking out to Walnut St. makes this place a winner. There are more comfortable seats on the second floor, but if the entire place was like that second floor, I would rank it 2 stars. It's the first floor ambiance, which gets me to that point of thinking, \"It's a Shadyside Coffee Tree kind of night.\" You can sit and crank out work on your laptop among other people who are doing the same. It's an iron sharpening iron kind of deal.   I was generous with 4 stars based on first floor ambiance. The shop as a whole . . . the downsides are it's cleanliness, bathrooms, and baristas. Listen . . . all are alarming to various degrees. I find this place dirty, to be honest. The drinks are affordable and sub par as a chain, but the baristas can be short and impersonal. It's hit or miss and I have experienced more misses. I'm not too upset about it, though. With a chain coffee shop, I'm mostly after ambiance. And this Coffee Tree's first floor makes it worth visiting in confidence.   *You may be able to score a free parking spot on Elmer St. (I can't believe I just gave that away . . .)  *You're welcome"}
{"text":"Great place to read or just have a break from the day. Large bay doors are great for letting in sun and fresh air. Typical price range of Starbucks or Caribou with a similar layout as well."}
{"text":"TL;DR: small tables; questionable placement of sugars and creamers; good for meetings and chats; not good for anything that requires Wi-Fi, food, and coffee  I've come to this Coffee Tree Roaster several times, usually by convenience because it's close to where I live and the other coffee shops in the area are full, or because it is a somewhat better location for small- to medium-sized study groups. Unfortunately, this shop hasn't impressed me in any way except for its isolated study room in the back.  The front of the shop has a garage door that is open or closed depending on the weather outside. The front seating area has about a dozen or so small tables, enough room to seat one person comfortably (I'd say up to two people if you're not planning on spreading a book or a even a tablet on top). The location of the cashier and the barista can be awkward, especially when there is a long line of people waiting to order and a large group of people waiting to get their orders. There doesn't seem to be an actual waiting area; people just congregate at the end of the bar where, inconveniently, the table of napkins, sugar packets, creamers, and pitchers of iced water is. Also inconveniently, there is a second table of condiments and creamers right next to the entrance of the shop. I can't imagine why it would be placed there...in front of the only entrance to the shop...where there is a constant stream of people coming in and going out. Good luck trying to add creamer to your coffee or get some napkins when it gets busy.  In addition to the aforementioned awkward placement of the sugar and creamer tables, remember what I said about the place where people usually congregate to pick up their orders? This \"waiting area\" is also in front of the the stairs that lead to the back of the shop. Double awkward and inconvenient.  The back of the shop has a small couch, a fireplace, additional small tables, and the glass-walled isolated study room. There are also two bathrooms in the back hallway by the study room. The seating around the fireplace is cozy, especially when it is lit on a cold day. The tables? They're the same as the front of the shop. The isolated study room is great, though. It has a few small tables along with a few longer tables, and it is effective in blocking most of the noise from the rest of the shop. Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi here is miserable. There is a 2-hour limit, after which you have to pay some fee to continue using. Its connection is also very spotty. Even if you haven't used up your free 2 hours, you will inevitably and inexplicably lose connection at least a few times. Sure, there may be a lot of people trying use the Internet--there are always many people trying to use the Internet at coffee shops--but that's one of the major reasons why people go to these coffee shops: to study, catch up on current events, listen to music, buy some stocks, watch YouTube, do online shopping, etc.  For a coffee shop, the food and drinks here are mediocre at best. Most of the coffee I've had tasted very bitter or burnt. Most of the pastries I've had were bland. If you're just in the mood for good coffee, do yourself a favor and go to other area coffee shops. I know that Jitters at the corner of Walnut and Ivy is excellent (they also sell ice cream, so affogatos anyone?)."}
{"text":"Excellent place to chill work in a nice location on walnut street in shadyside.  Usually play good music but tonight I almost stole the guys headphones next to me to save me from the way too Singy, song writingly, songs.  You know what I mean.  I feel like I owe it to the manager here to add to the review above with an updated comment about the 'Queen' rock music day for the last 5 hours. Loll, awesome!  I just adjusted my review from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with this coffee tree roasters.  Good service, clean and open space with plenty of outdoor space.  Google and Social are right next door so you would think it would develop an excellent creative atmosphere for working or chilling but it never has developed that cool coffee house buzz.  The coffee Tree on Walnut does an excellent job with it but this Coffee Tree has not.  Maybe they should bring in some musicians once in a while or at least have some art on their walls?"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  They have regular tables in the front and then a fireplace with comfy chairs in the back. People there were working, having meetings, reading the paper, etc. it was definitely a great place to hang out or meet up with friends.  I ordered oatmeal and a mocha frappacino. I picked the kind of oatmeal and they added the hot water to \"cook\" it. My frap was very good. They also have small cups and a pitcher of ice water. After my frap and oatmeal the ice water was nice.  The staff is kind and the shop is very clean. If you haven't been there you should check it out."}
{"text":"CTR is always my go-to when out and about in the Shadyside area. The coffee is always on point, the staff is always friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming.   While I was studying at Duquesne, we had a CTR in the business school, unfortunately it was replaced with a \"Starbucks\" halfway through my time there. But luckily, I can always get my CTR fix in Shadyside."}
{"text":"I walked in this coffee establishment assuming that it would be similar to a Starbucks or a comparable establishment. As I ordered my cold brewed iced coffee with added espresso shot. I noticed the NFC device next to the cash register, I proceeded to pull out my iPhone sex like a big douche bag and try to pay with Apple Pay, the cashier a young and na√Øve woman proceeded to tell me, what is that? I've never even heard of that before. It's really time, that all coffee places get on the same page, regarding payment methods. I felt as if the cashier made me feel like a total moron, simply because I wanted to use the latest and greatest technology to pay for my drink.  I will not return, and I urge you all to choose Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and hang out with friends, read a book or just get some work done on your Palm Pilot or listen to your Dell DJ. Nice hot drinks and atmosphere. The only problem was their WiFi wasn't compatible with my Prodigy internet service..."}
{"text":"The baristas were confused and looked very tired (they weren't unkind though, just very dry and tired). There were two of them working at the time, and even though there weren't too many customers, they seemed to be very busy and less attentive to the customers' experience.  The major reason for the measly 2 stars is that they have NO WI-FI. It says that they have \"green-light wi-fi\", which I've seen before to be reliable. I couldn't find it once I sat down with a coffee. I gently asked which wi-fi to use, and one of the baristas (she seemed new) glanced out the window and gave me the name of the hotel across the parking lot. It was, of course, too far away to work.  They are very disorganized. Their coffee is average, nothing spectacular. Their tables were covered with crumbs. They don't have enough power outlets. Are they serious about business? I wouldn't bet on it.   I walked across the street and came to Panera's. Their staff is kind, their shop is spacious, and their wi-fi works."}
{"text":"The coffee is on par with the other chains in Pittsburgh. I liked the open storefront and the quiet study room in the back. Also, the barista was very friendly!   I was displeased with the small tables, uncomfortable seating, and the dim lighting. The wifi has a 2 hour limit and disconnected from my device after very short idle periods."}
{"text":"i must admit that i'm shocked at the poor reviews for this coffee tree roasters location.  though i don't spend time in the store, i always grab an espresso or latte whenever i'm in shadyside.  i absolutely love their beans.  i even buy their whole beans to brew at home."}
{"text":"Their matcha latte is the best. I stop here exclusively to buy this drink , when I am in the area.  It is authentic, and the staff are nice, too."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who gets really annoyed that they only offer 2-hour free wi-fi? I get no coffee shop wants people who only gets one drink for the entire day, but really? So far as I know, no other coffee shops have this kind of 2-hour limit on using their free wifi except CTR. I work from coffee shops a lot. Usually if I have to stay for a relatively long period of time, I will keep purchasing drinks or snacks every a few hours or give extra tips to keep the owners profitable from my stay. I hate to use the store's wifi for nothing. But when this CTR says they only have free wifi for 2 hours, I'd rather use my personal hotspot and pay evil ATT for internet access than make a purchase at the coffee shop. I know that you can always ask the baristas for password if your 2-hour expired, but yeah, another hurdle to jump."}
{"text":"I like the look of this Coffee Tree Roasters location more than anything else.  If you like people watching on a nice day, try grabbing a seat near the front of the shop, when they open up the huge glass windows.  In the winter, the coveted seating is towards the back of the shop, the couches and chairs by the fireplace.  The meeting room in the back is handy, but I've found it to be really chilly in the winter--not sure how it is in other seasons.  The coffee's all right, and I feel \"meh\" about the hot chocolate and chai.  While the baked goods in the case look tempting, I haven't been wowed.  One person I went with got a biscotti, which was rock hard--now, biscotti's supposed to be crispy, but not that hard.  When she told the baristas, they informed her that the biscotti was supposed to be that way (didn't she know any better?).  At best, I've found the service here to be civil, not friendly."}
{"text":"Good coffee and muffins here and a great place to do some remote work, although it can be quite crowded on Sunday even with all their tables."}
{"text":"great place to hang out - wifi and a large iced coffee, what more could you ask for? well, perhaps more outlets."}
{"text":"I aleays liked the coffee here. For sure much more than the starbucks. However, I got the Apple pie latte this time and was nothing close to apple. The pastries are pretty good here too."}
{"text":"The Coffee Tree Roasters is a great place to relax and enjoy your cup of coffee. When the weather is nice, they will open the front window which actually pulls up like a garage door. There is also free wifi so you can get your work done. I also love how they have stickers that I can place on my coffee cup to give it some personality. The ability to add stuff to your coffee is important and having a selection and availability is a good rule of judgement for coffee places. They offer cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, and sugar additions as well as simple syrup in a squeeze bottle and water and lemons. This place is my go to for some quiet reading and studying."}
{"text":"Cute place with a delicious cap! Perfectly proportionate."}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Cozy, warm atmosphere especially the chairs and ottomans by the fire.  The window swing open in nice weather leaving the shop with an outdoor seating feel.  They can make a damn fine iced latte without it being thin, too creamy or overly sweet.  They also have a great selection of beans that I've been taking home.  Kinda love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!   Yes it's coffee, and yes it's delicious!   But why 5 stars? Options, and locally owned! Buy local!   Plus this place has a tin of snacks and food!  They all seem healthy, GMO free, and delicious! If you can do it, fewer chemicals in your body is always a better option... And we support places who believe in this!   The staff is friendly, accommodating, and the outdoor patio is nice!   If you are staying at Springhill Suites walk the extra 100 feet cross the parking lot, and actually enjoy your morning coffee!"}
{"text":"I've driven by a million times and never stopped in. The apparent lack of parking was what always kept me moving l, but there's actually a huge parking lot just behind the row of buildings.   The shop is clean and well laid out. There are three large menus on the wall dedicated to their drinks.   When I went in it was just after lunch time, but I was pretty ravenously hungry. I asked the barista what she had in the way of lunch and she said, \"not much.\" She wasn't kidding. They don't make their own food in house and there's nothing with meat.   That was actually a plus for me since I do the whole vegetarian thing, but it could be a turn off for some people. She suggested a mixed green wrap made by The Modern Greek. It was a whole wheat wrap that was filled with spinach, arugula and other leaves. They're was a sweet vinaigrette and hummus for dipping. I was initially unimpressed with how little was going on with my wrap, but the hummus was spicey and flavorful.   It turned out to be a great thing to eat while I chilled and got some work done. And the wireless was pretty fast too."}
{"text":"The space is HUGE and even includes a separate study room. This place is very smart about catering to its patrons who come to study/do work.   I only wished they had asked if it was for here or to go....my drink could've fit in a mug. Not sure if they even do mugs here but I always favor coffee shops that have them because of A) sustainability and B) it's just more homey."}
{"text":"This is a decent coffee shop in the heart of Squirrel Hill. The cappuccinos and biscotti (my favorite combination) are typically delicious, and the outlets are plentiful for all you fellow laptop jockeys.  There is self-serve water available, and a row of chairs against a bar in case you want to work while the chairs and tables are occupied.  The one big weakness is the wifi. Not only is it SLLLOOOOWWWW, but you have to get a ticket for a code, which expires after a short time. That's not the end of the world, but it's a little inconvenient and perplexing when the connection has a snail's pace. The acoustics are also very . . .echoey so if loud voices will disrupt your work, you might want to try elsewhere.  If I could, I would give this 3.5 stars, but I feel good about rounding this up to four, purely because of their hours - they close at midnight, which is simply fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been to every Coffee Tree location, and they are all about the same.  Coffee and espresso drinks are just ok, but the staff is indifferent and the food selections tend toward the pre-packaged junk variety (i.e., all the baked goods are wrapped in cellophane.)  At this particular location, they just played Alice in Chains, followed immediately by Journey.  So, some points off for atmosphere as well.  And, I ordered a double americano, and the cashier told the barista I wanted a \"small,\" which seems to be a single shot.  Gripes aside, the space  is bright and airy and conveniently located in Bakery Square."}
{"text":"The best coffee around.  In a town of low standards and high prices this place is always consistently good."}
{"text":"I always think that this place is warm and welcoming. They no longer have my favorite drink but I am trying to get over that. If you come when they are slow hopefully you are able to catch the couch seat by the fireplace. That is usually the spot where I like to navigate too. Today I was scoping it out as some ladies left and I was able to swoop in and score a prime comfy couch right next to the fireplace.   I did not want coffee since it was already past 4 and I was heading to the gym after. I am not a big fan of the energize and then work out. I am a more energize in the morning or before I have to do a lot of homework type of person. Caffeine before working out just makes me nauseous. So I opted for something different. Usually Italian soda is my go to jam, but this time I went for the hot apple cider grogge. I love apple cider and it warmed and spiced sounded a lot better to me than a cold drink. The weather in PGH is changing and while I usually like a nice cold drink even I can sometimes surprise myself.   I was pleasantly surprised to say that the drink was not overly sweet. It wasn't too much and made me get the sugar shakes. It was just right. Just the right amount of sweetness and just the right amount of spices to make it comforting and delightful.   I would get this again if it is on the menu. It was just enough to get me through the few hours before I was heading to the gym. But not overly sweet to make me shaky. It was a good pick and suggestion from the barista. I would take her word the next time I come in and am I unsure, which does happen a lot!"}
{"text":"Lattes are real good, and I know the difference between what's good or not. Also,  atmosphere here is on point specially with their large store front window that they open up on nice days."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood coffee.  Small but always seems to have room.  Good selection of teas also..  Good scones and pastries.  CT dos have some specialty blends."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this coffee shop. It used to be my favorite place on earth to come relax and read a book or study. There used to always be chill background classical music playing. Great coffee. Just an overall great place to spend my Saturdays or Sundays when I didn't want to, but had to study and get work done! Nowadays, every time I come to the coffee shop I feel like I am at a bar. The music is always SO loud now, also the music that is played has nothing to do with chill music anymore, it ranges from pop to electronic music, to rock music or indie, which I love... but I just don't think it fits a coffee shop environment. I always see people usually wearing their own headphones and or earplugs, only because they must also be annoyed with the music. I, for an example, have my earplugs in at the moment and I can STILL hear the \"background music\" because it is so loud!! It is honestly very disrupting to people who come here to study. If a coffee shop offers tables and outlets for people to sit and study, chat, etc... they should make the environment fit. If I wanted to hear real loud music while studying I could of just gone to a bar...."}
{"text":"The location is great but the baristas would rather have conversations with their friends than wait on you. And it's hit or miss as to whether your drink will be right or not."}
{"text":"I've been working here a lot (like a lot) this year due to the favorable atmosphere.   1. The space is ample, comfortable, and clean. There are some \"rush\" times with Google and other businesses nearby, but in general, this store has a nice, steady flow that never keeps you waiting too long or prohibits you from finding table or a spot to sit. Also, I dig the chairs and couch and the fireplace. All those huge wooden community tables at Starbucks stores are not comfortable. Plugs are plentiful. The store is usually spotlessly clean -- the staff is constantly cleaning -- as are the bathrooms. The coffee bar is aways fully stocked. 2. The staff is professional and helpful. I wouldn't go so far as to say friendly, but they do their jobs efficiently, and I've never seen an unhappy customer or a lazy or rude employee.  3. The coffee drinks are delicious. I've never had a bitter or burnt coffee. Also, they always have an enormous pitcher of ice water on the bar. 4. The food is good. Bonus points for the gluten-free: they carry Gluuteny products!  All in all, CTR-Bakery Square is a great option for a place to meet for coffee or to get some work done.   Just please don't take my chair--I like the one in the corner by the fireplace!  Only one thing makes me cringe: I wish this location would recycle--so much plastic and paper waste from the cups!"}
{"text":"My favorite Coffeeshop in Pittsburgh.   Coffeetree Roasters is my happy place. I work from home and am a part-time student. I often start my workday sitting in the back of the shop, drinking my first (of many :) ) cups of coffee for the day. I will end my day, just as it started, but this time doing school work.   Coffeetree Roasters is large enough that you will not get distracted. They have large tables, couches and a private room that can be reserved for meetings and events. They have a garage door that they pull open on nicer \"Burgh\" days and are also Pet friendly.   While I enjoy black coffee, the Baristas can whip up any drink that you desire. They also offer a wide variety of coffee/tea-related merchandise, as well as coffee beans for purchase.   If you are a coffee addict like me, you should definitely check out one of their many locations around the city!"}
{"text":"My homebase CTR is the Fox Chapel location (which is LOVE) - so this is the first time I visited the Squirrel Hill location. It's a bit cramped in some areas, but there are also a variety of seating options (barstools/counter, front tables, back tables) throughout the space. And, with the garage door opening, I imagine it's nice in warm weather. During this visit, the wait was rather long. Neither of the baristas seemed able to answer any questions about their coffee drinks or variety of coffee beans, which was surprising since this is a coffee shop. Once we got through the initial line, our drinks were ready pretty fast. They were okay and prepared mostly as we had ordered them - although I had to repeat the order twice to both people. I can't say that my experience was as good as the Fox Chapel location but I am definitely still a CTR fan!"}
{"text":"To stop by here on my way to school, I have to make a big detour. I know it's a waste of time but I can't cut off myself from coffee tree. When I need to improve my mood, I try a cup of coffee here.   Its vanilla latte is really soft but clerk doesn't catch my intention so often. Yeah. My first language is not English so I had to practice and practice to get my coffee.   Like this, There are barriers to stick on coffee tree but I don't give up yet.  So, I want to tell Coffee Tree staffs this: Next time when I go there, please be nice to me:D Don't forget an Asian girl desperately looking for her \"vanilla latte\"."}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty par for Pittsburgh.  They offer some food options but I didn't try any.  The reasons I probably won't return to this location are the size and wifi.  It is REALLY small.  If you're here to use wifi you only get 2 free hours.  After that you get a message saying to come back in 8 hours for another 2 free hours.  I guess it makes sense so they have more turnover but as a person that could spend all day in a coffee shop and order multiple drinks I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is just a great coffee house in all regards. First and foremost, coffee is always delicious, no matter what the brew for the day. Pastries are always good too and the staff is always really nice. The ambiance is great to relax and read by the fire, work at a table, chat with a friend or study in their quiet room, which is a neat feature."}
{"text":"Flavorful not bitter I have only had a double espresso iced & a regular I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Coffee Tree Roasters has become a coffee shop staple for me to work and study. The Shadyside location has a clear garage like door for a window which they put up when the weather is nice (and even when a sprinkle of rain occurs) and I absolutely love that part of this place.  They also have in the back a conference room with all glass windows so if it is not reserved and the people around you are talking you can go in (though seems like it might need an air freshener and have a rug renovation). Next to the conference room is the bathroom which they do keep clean.  Weekends are typically crazy filled with people so if you want a seat either come early or come late (opened until midnight!) though offer a lot more seating compared to other places in the area. Even when there is a long line, the cashiers have been helpful and have gotten me what I have bought so no complaints there.  I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means but not a fan of their hot lattes and their hot coffee is okay though do like their ice coffee, ice teas, hot teas and chai. Their sweets are fantastic to boot (rice krispies, wafers - which are 5 for $1, biscottis and cookies) though hope they will have more savory items for snacking (sometimes they have pita and sandwiches available for purchase). Probably good they have not offered more of a selection for snacks since I feel like I'm always eating and drinking in here anyway..."}
{"text":"CTR is the best and I'm so happy we have it in Pittsburgh! the Shadyside location is my favorite because  of the open, warehouse feel and exposed brick. They have a great selection of coffees that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This place offers a sliver of charm for those who shop/stroll along Walnut St. and want to drop in for an espresso. It has a big clear garage window which is always open when weather permits - and this allows for good people watching. Nevertheless, it still lacks some of the warmth and welcome that you find in other independent coffee shops. Although there are a lot of electrical outlets, this place may not be the best spot to study for a couple hours (esp. during weekend peak times). Tables can be scarce and it seems like the owner/staff are less than thrilled about a bunch of sweatshirt clad students detracting from the Walnut St. bistro-charm. If you still decide to hit the books, there is a semi-soundproof room in the back where some like to study, however it also serves as a \"community room\" that is periodically reserved. Prices on coffee are decent, but the food and desserts are way over-priced and disappointing to the palate."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and was really glad it opened at 5am because it was the only place around to buy coffee. The stores decor was really nice but it looked like a knock off of Starbucks. Not a lot of parking but there is a parking garage a little walk away and they have a nice patio. Chatham College is a short walk away and a nice park across the street."}
{"text":"Since it was a warm day I decided not to opt for coffee but have a ginger green tea instead. I glanced at the desserts in the cold trays and inquired where they were from. I learned that some of them come from Nancy B's in Homestead. Yes, they have their famous chocolate chip peanut butter cookie if you want it.  I was full from my lunch so just settled for a drink. They have free WiFi here if you are working. In the back they sell Chemex, various coffees, and various apparatus for pour overs. The tea was very good and i enjoyed it.  Next time I'm in the area will sample one of their coffee blends."}
{"text":"I had a large regular drip from here and it was probably my favorite cup of coffee that I had in Pittsburgh. I just arrived in town, GPS was taking me to roads that didn't exist, so I had a beer and then this cup of coffee. I really enjoyed it. There was a lot of flavor. I stumbled upon this place accidentally and am sure glad that I did."}
{"text":"Great local business to go to when you need a break from Starbucks. As a matter of fact I bought several gift cards here for Xmas presents for coffee lovers at work, instead of Starbucks. Good coffee, comfortable setting, no corporate feet like most Starbucks. Pastry case looks appetizing and bought from local establishments. This is a no brainer, Shop local when you can."}
{"text":"I love local businesses, The people who run The Coffee Tree Roasters have a great business going. I admit I love Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, Crazy Mocha, and all the others, but Coffee Tree Roasters has the best coffee in the city. Their French Roast is over the top, syrupy, smokey sweet notes with a bold but not bitter flavor.  I love to order a French press of their French Roast and sit down with the City Paper and kill an hour.   I'm not much for the foo foo drinks like frozen frappa cappachino with 3 shots, low foam, extra wet, blah blah blah. I do on occasion, mostly in summer month enjoy Iced coffee. At Coffee Tree they have the best. They double brew their Iced coffee so it stands up to ice. I get it with sugar free vanilla syrup and soy milk. As good as a milk shake without the calories, fat, and guilt.  They have great employees here, and the one on Beverly Rd. in Mt Lebo.   Great bakery showcase, the lemon pound cake doesn't quite match the Starbucks lemon loaf but the coffee wins, hands down!"}
{"text":"The best coffee around. Knowledgeable staff, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"They messed up my order with the wrong cream cheese, then my companion found a freaking marble in her salad. I reported the marble to staff and they just shrugged and offered another salad."}
{"text":"I started going here more because when I came a week ago or so, the guy made an absolutely perfect latte (appropriate parts micro foam, steamed milk and espresso). Very recently I came and received my small latte that was mostly all foam and turned into a big ball of foam in the middle and once it was mostly settled, it was only filled half way or so. Just kind of a bummer other than that the atmosphere here is always great. (The 2 stars is based just off of the latte experience)"}
{"text":"I've been a customer here for a few years now. My overall impression is that this is an unpretentious place that doesn't try to cater to any particular type of customer. It is nice to hear classical music often played over the sound system.    Baristas have been consistently polite and/or friendly. Baristas do not play watch over what people are or are not doing. A good place to study or have a quiet conversation.   The coffee is decent, not as caffeine-rich as Starbucks's, I haven't had any coffee problems after something close to 100 orders."}
{"text":"Decent little coffee shop at Bakery Square. Everything a coffee aficionado would need is here: good selection of origin coffees, tea, even coffee equipment. The store has a nice lounge seating area including a (real!) fire place, and a bunch of tables. Outdoor seating is available in the summer months.  Only 3 stars as my drip was lacking in flavor (three days in a row), and I had to pump it up with brown sugar (which I normally would never do).   Overall though good place to hang and chill."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice walking street, good selection of teas and little gifty things, good pastries, *excellent* scones, and it's not that other green-logo'd coffee place."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday evening nice cozy feelling. When you walk in. It's definetly a coffe shop atmosphere. Best part the new ownership allows you to bring a packed lunch if all your in the mood for is a drink and not coffe shop food. They are informative about the area. They helped me out with good directions. The tea is actually pretty good. Heard good things about this place will definitely be back. Food look great. Also,  only reason for four was the WiFi. I couldn't really use it."}
{"text":"Great coffee house in a great neighborhood.  I really like the 'quiet room' in the back, the fireplace, and the numerous electrical outlets.  Great clientele, and while yes, I've had a couple of odd moments with the baristas, I've also met some really cool ones.  And what do you think this is?  Starbucks?  Of course they give you a little attitude.  No \"flair\""}
{"text":"Friendly staff but some pastries were stale by 10pm. Nice outdoor seating. Nice safe neighborhood. Bring your laptop free WiFi."}
{"text":"I will never go back again. I am an avid coffee drinker and am a fan of Starbucks but always love trying new places. The baristas were rude and stuck up. They could not have seemed less interested in me or my business. I did not appreciate the attitude. Unless you're one of their hipster friends, don't bother."}
{"text":"I love coffee tree roaster, I go to both the squirrel hill one and shadyside one. The shadyside one is larger but there are often no seats left. More younger people doing work or catching up with friends there. Coffee tree roaster is my go to studying spot since they open til midnight. I love their drinks as well, they have good mocha and black tea. Also if you get their tea using their glass, they do free refills for you which is amazing. Everyone is also very friendly there. I have many interesting conversations with random people there. It does get kind of loud sometimes. The only complaint is the free wifi only last two hours -_-"}
{"text":"Holy smokes, that is some STRONG coffee. I can be sensitive to caffeine now and again, but Coffee Tree Roasters definitely is the strongest I've had thus far.   It was a beautiful day, 90 degree weather, so I went for the cold brew to sip on while I enjoy the sun in their outdoor seating area. There's plenty of space to sprawl out which I love. Their prices are on the higher end. My small iced coffee was $2.51. Not terrible but the penny pincher in me cringed a little as I handed over my credit card.  Coffee Tree Roasters knows how to make delicious, high quality coffee, that's for sure. I loved the taste of the cold brew - very bold and bitter. I was feeling a slight caffeine buzz halfway through my cup. Pathetic, I know.   Overall, the coffee was great, and I will be certainly be back! (hopefully when I can handle caffeine a little better)"}
{"text":"My go to study spot.  I've enjoyed the regular coffee, ice teas, and biscotti. Decent amount of electrical outlets which is crucial to my sad existence as a PC user.  Open until midnight everyday if I'm not mistaken which is heaven for a stressed out grad student.  Great for hitting the books while being able to take study breaks to people watch. On nice days, the whole front opens as it is a garage door offering an awesome feel.  Staff has always been polite and doesn't seem to mind students hogging tables for hours upon hours.   Actually, as I write this review I realize this may be my favorite coffee house ever."}
{"text":"Just happened to be over that way and stopped in...what a nice surprise. Lots better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"A quick stop was made for some coffee and a snack. This place is cozy. The smell of coffee and comfy seats are worth coming in and spend my a couple hours.  As for the staff, friendly but I felt a little rushed and like I wasn't really understanding anything they were selling. The snacks/baked goods aren't labeled for you to see so it's sort of like roulette. I got a smoothie and it wasn't good. As for my baked good, it was perfect just have them explain to you what it is if you don't understand-especially if you have an allergy!!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about the weird interaction I had with a Barista here.  I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question, right?  She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??  The only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....  Oh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).   Made exactly how I ordered it, extra hot, which a lot of people do not do correctly (it needs to burn my tongue, for realz).    But for me, this is a spot I'd avoid....way too crowded!"}
{"text":"I like friendly Baristas!  Probably because I used to be one and know that if you're a friendly costumer you'll have a nice, smiling friendly Barista on the the other side of the counter.  At least, you should have!  So the Barista here, totally friendly!  We chatted for a bit while they were making my iced chai latte.  Chatting and coffee shops go together like cookies and milk.  You gotta have both to really enjoy the experience.    My iced chai was up to my chai standards.  I knew right away it was the good chai concentrate and a great balance between the chai and milk.  They win, I win....we all win!  The coffee shop has a pretty large area to set up shop if you'd like to work or meet with a friend over coffee.  I can't wait for Bakery Square to grow so more people can enjoy this Coffee Tree location.    And next time, when I'm not in the chai mood, I'm ordering one of those \"gallon\" iced green teas.  You may be peeing a lot after...but I'm sure it's totally worth it and refreshing!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are just okay, but I LOVE to come here to study and do homework.  Very spacious and I almost always get a seat up top by the fireplace.  I much prefer this location over the Bakery Square one. That one has too many windows and I can never see my computer screen haha."}
{"text":"I really don't know why, but I have never really much cared for this place, which is a shame, because it's close to home, and I had figured I would spend a lot of time there, especially since it's not just open to the bustle of Walnut Street but also open late.  I miss the friendly coffee shops I'm used to in the San Francisco area, and the flow of people, and had thought this one would be a good substitute, a new home-away-from-home kind of place to just kick back.    I'm just not very comfortable there, though, and I don't mean the not-very-comfortable chairs, which really aren't all that different from many other places.    Maybe it's the high ceiling, which robs it of any feeling of coziness that is nice to have in a neighborhood coffee shop.  It's a big space, with a lot of room between tables, which is nice for maneuvering around, but works against the coziness factor as well.    The only average food and drink don't help, nor does the lack of trash cans next to the sweetener/milk stations, necessitating a schlep across the broad expanse of store to throw something away - which isn't easy with your hands full, especially when one of them is needed to wield a cane.     The garage door front makes it a lovely spot on a day or evening that is not too hot and not too cold, but it still doesn't overcome the feeling of... I guess the feeling of not feeling particularly welcome.  Ever.  Somehow, there's just really no \"there\" there. There's a coldness, a sterility, about the place that is just discomfiting.    I was in there tonight, and the place was as silent as a tomb, despite at least half the tables being occupied.  There was quiet music, but not one single conversation, and other patrons actually gave me the hairy eyeball of disgust when I took a call, even though I kept my voice low.  Weird... Can't blame the patrons for the place, but it was still odd with a bunch of millennials all around.    What really got me, though, was when I went to get a refill on my ice tea, and the guy at the register wanted to charge me for it, and gave me a rash of very unfriendly, whining, reluctant shit when I told him the other guy I'd bought it from had said they do give one free refill.  I'd asked about refills when I'd paid, and was told that they don't normally give them in the plastic cups, but only in glass ones for there - but he hadn't even asked me if I'd wanted it for there or to go, just gave me the plastic to-go cup after ascertaining what size I wanted.  So, he said I could in fact have a refill when I pointed that out.  How was I to have known they even *had* another option?  I've never gotten ice tea there.    But #2 guy didn't seem at all impressed that I'd been sitting right there all along, not too far from the end of his own nose, and planned to continue doing so.  He did finally sort of agree to give me the refill at no charge, after first insisting on full payment, then only very reluctantly saying that, well, OK, he *supposed* he *could* give me a *discount*, but his attitude was loaded with such massive resistance, reluctance, stinginess, and sheer lack of interest in anything resembling desire to provide even passable customer service that I just left my cup on the counter and walked out.    Now look.  I can easily afford a second glass of tea; this isn't about the money in the slightest.  It's about the attitude.    It's about refusing to honor what another employee already promised, or to even check with the other guy about it - i.e. truly abysmal customer service and not giving a customer the benefit of the doubt.  It's about a very \"We don't want you here and don't care at all about making you feel welcome\" tone - which was amply reflected in the twisting, sneering kind of expressions on his face.    It's also about incredible stinginess.  I mean, what difference does the material of the glass make when the customer is *sitting right there*, if the refill would have been willingly given otherwise?    And it's freaking *ice tea*, for heaven's sake - probably the very cheapest non-tap water beverage to be had anywhere because it is, by definition, so totally watered down.  And cheap to start with, because most tea *is* cheap, and you know there's no way they are using the top shelf stuff for it.    Plus my having a plastic cup means one less dish to wash, which means a bit less water and dish soap used, etc."}
{"text":"I love this place for the fact that they have a great location on Walnut St and their ice coffee and frozen coffee drinks I feel are better than Starbucks.  For a 16oz hot coffee drink it's around $4.50.  Which is I think a little cheaper than Starbucks.  When it's cool outside they open the from window, which is a big garage type window and it lets a nice breeze into the place and makes it even more inviting.  Nice staff there the times I went. I always get a drink to go since I don't usually have time to sit or have the need to sit and drink it. But they have a lot of places to sit and a glass study room if you want privacy for studying to meeting with co workers.  Definitely worth try."}
{"text":"Whether I am looking for a caffeine buzz or a quiet place to study, my go-to place is Coffee Tree Roasters on Walnut Street.  My drink selections are always pretty basic, classic coffee or chai latte, but I have heard from friends that their signature drinks and smoothies are delicious!  There is a big garage door on the face of the shop that they open during warm weather.  You can choose to sit at the cafe style seating in the front, or they offer comfy couches next to a fireplace in the back.  They always have a pitcher of ice water on the counter, and fun stickers you can choose for your cup!  They also have a nice selection of pastries and sandwiches if you're hungry.  Walnut Street has a free wifi connection too!"}
{"text":"The hours is one of the reasons why you will often find me at Coffee tree roasters.  The cool reading room in the back is usually quiet, however sometimes it's infiltrated by loud people :( The baristas are pretty nice. It's a big location which is nice."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about coffee tree roasters. On the one hand I really like that they roast their own beans and that they are fresh. On the other I don't feel those beans are top notch. Other coffee shops might buy other roasters beans but they are a higher quality and just plain taste better.  The locations that I have visited are pretty cool and feel comfortable but I can't get past that there are better coffee shops around the burgh if you take the time to look."}
