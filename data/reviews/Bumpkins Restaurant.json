{"text":"This is serviceable continental cuisine, old Toronto style, not exquisite but tasty enough and filling, though my partner said he \"wouldn't come back\". I enjoyed the house pate and escargot; the mussels less so. Warning: medium rare means rare here. Very good service and a comfortable room."}
{"text":"Best rack of lamb and Cuban lobster I have ever had.  The appetizers were good too and the French chocolate torte was to die for.  So good totally recommend for fine dining.  Service was excellent.  Totally catered to us because it was our anniversary.  But I think they do anyway."}
{"text":"Unobtrusive Continental Restaurant just off Yonge Street, Two blocks North of Wellesley TTC Station. Have been going here for years and cannot understand why it is not more popular, probably because of its location. Has nice summer patio, and inside windows overlook a parkette. Extensive menu. Good & friendly service. Fireplace in winter."}
{"text":"This is a modestly priced restaurant. The portions are generous and the price very reasonable. We had Sunday Brunch here and found the service good. Each meal order comes with an option of a soup or salad and some bread rolls which were excellent! The food was also good."}
{"text":"Went for a work lunch and ordered the chicken cesar salad which was $17. The description didn't really match and it was the most plain and bland salad I have had. The lettuce was not crisp with some browned leaves, dressing didn't have much flavour and seemed watered down. Chicken breast tasted like one of those steamed cooked breasts you get when you go to a large wedding with no flavour. There was one and half croutons on the plate. Wasn't impressed. 

Nice decor, nice servers who were very attentive to the group but I can't get over how underwhelming the salad was."}
{"text":"Bumpkins has been around for decades and contrary to it's name, it is actually a very high end spot.

I had to check it out after constantly walking by at night time when it was closed.  

The place is beautifully lit and tastefully decorated with art and sculptures.

There is a nice patio which in the day plays beautiful  music. Everything from Vivaldi to classic Italian opera hits.

The staff are not the traditional \"young and hip cool people\" you get in Toronto but rather well spoken, educated and refined gentlemen and women.

The food as with everything else exudes class. Seafood, pasta, steak and much more. All reasonably priced and I would even consider them to be great value when you factor in the quality.

All in all, this place is an old neighborhood staple which is less known than most and located just far enough off Yonge to be tranquil and romantic for those special evenings.

I truly do recommend people give it a shot because these guys do it better than your average Bumpkins!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to entertain clients over a quiet brunch.  Large well spaced tables lets itself well to discussing business.  I have only ever had the eggs benedict, they do it well with lettuce salad, fruit and real home fried potatoes.  Presentation is nailed and  the service is flawless, personal and they seem to know when to leave you alone so you can get down to  business with your clients. The only weak link is If you are a coffee lover which I am, I would suggest you skip the coffee at $3.00 per cup, it is anything but gourmet and you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"After walking past the charming exterior on multiple occasions we decide to give Bumpkins a try.  They did not take our coats, but we were promptly seated upon arrival without having made a reservation. Everything started out fine. The waiter promptly took our order and brought our drinks. The bread was warm and delicious. From there things went down hill. We ordered the lobster and the surf and turf. A half hour later we were told there was a mistake in the kitchen and the food would be out shortly. An hour after our order was taken still no food. At this point I was ready to leave but as I asked for the check our food appeared.  Two of the lobster tails were dry and cold. The surf and turf steak and lobster were both delicious and prepared properly. The vegetables and potatoes were also excellent. Both the front and back of the house were obviously understaffed. The manager was smug and uninterested. The server did a good job under the circumstances.  There are way to many excellent restaurants within a two block radius for me to ever return to Bumpkin again."}
{"text":"Well, I never got a chance to experience Bumpkins' food -- so I can't rate that.  But the fact that I called yesterday to make reservations SPECIFICALLY for a table at their patio, and was assured I would have one -- and then learn upon arrival that their patio is closed -- definitely doesn't put me in the mood to spend my money there or to recommend it to anyone.  Not to mention that the weather was perfect, and all around it people were enjoying food and drinks on the patios -- why would they even close the patio?  But -- why not tell me that upfront rather than acquire an angry misled customer?  Beats me."}
{"text":"Cute little place in a quiet street. The place is dim and cozy, great setting. Host was friendly, and we were seated immediately. The menu has a great range of food, didn't know what to choose for the longest time.

Appetizer: mussels. They were prettty awesome, good amount and great flavour. My friend had the soup of the day and loved it. The grilled calamari was good as well.

Entree: surf and turf. The lobster is tender. The steak, I asked for medium rare but it was a little over-done. Not a great steak but I guess this is not a steak house. The potatoes on the side was great though!

Dessert: Tiramisu is better than most places. They had a good selection of desserts. 

The service is friendly, and the waitor recommended a good wine. We went on a quiet day, or it's just not so busy there. Overall the atmosphere and experience were great. :)"}
{"text":"Just as good as it was 15 years ago.  Ambience is nice and the food is always good.  Hot bread and soft butter is always so good.  Service is excellent and food is always consistent.  Steaks with garlic on top is so good."}
{"text":"Food is average but too pricey. Service is very slow - expect to wait an hour to get your entree. This place has an interesting but not tasty menu. It is however located within 2 blocks from the Wellesley subway station."}
{"text":"The service was really great but the food was subpar. I should have realized this when walking into an almost empty restaurant, in the core of downtown, on Mother's Day. But since the restaurant had many positive Yelp reviews, I still thought I would have a good experience.

Let's start off with the positives: the service was absolutely amazing. The cleanliness met my expectations... The food however, that was the disgusting part.

We ordered the lasagna, leg of lamb, a seafood dish (my mother ordered this, I forget what it was exactly) and a salad. All of the food was BLAND. Absolutely no seasoning what so ever. It's really hard to mess up a salad and potatoes, but they did exactly that. 

Don't think I can go to this place again. The service was really good but you can't eat service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is awful. Only thing good was the warm bread. Prime rib was tough. Vegetables are boring. Duck was chewy on orange sauce that came with it needs some help. Definitely won't be back here. This place was once good way back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times and I must say it is one of the best restaurants in the downtown area. One of the specialties there is the escargot and I strongly recommend you try it if you get the chance to go there. The waiters are absolutely amazing and very friendly. We see the owner there almost every time and he always makes sure the service is always up to the highest standards. Amazing place! Great food! Good pricing! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed being at Bumpkins, whether it's for lunch, dinner or brunch.  Service is very good, and the food is excellent and beautifully presented.  Management is always attentive and very polite.  The restaurant is in top shape, patio is always clean and decorated nicely with the flowers and fountain.  Prices are very reasonable, and the menu has an extensive selection.  You owe it to yourself to discover this gem."}
{"text":"I've been for brunch and dinner here and both were fabulous!! Their eggs florentine are delicious! 

Their staff is really friendly. I don't really notice it being too busy though so I'm hoping they stay around!!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, warm atmosphere.  Great service. Our waiter was named David, he was very professional and gave his recommendations.  Large variety to choose from on the menu, along with the specials of the day. I had the mussels in a cream sauce.  Flavour was good but sauce was very watery. I followed with the salmon which was delicious served with roast potatoes and mixed vegetables. A glass of chardonny completed the meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Lovely wait staff made us feel like part of the neighborhood, were very polite, and served us rather quickly. The food was reasonably priced, but it was exquisite, especially the Strawberry Crepes; I would literally die and go to heaven for those. If you're ever looking for a great brunch in Toronto, look no further."}
{"text":"My wife and i ate here a few times several years ago.  Great food at very reasonable prices, but the place was starting to look a bit tired so we were in no hurry to go back.  Last week we were invited to a family function which happened to be hosted here.  We could not believe this was the same restaurant - it has been completely transformed both inside and out.  It's now elegant and cozy but they retained the charm of the century old building.

Thankfully what did not change was the quality of the food and service.  Extensive menu with something to please everyone in the group.  Probably the best french onion soups i have ever had.  Steak was beautifully seasoned.  Seafood seemed to be a big hit with those that went this option with a few raving about the steamed mussels.

Great to see the same waiters from years ago were still here, and jovial as ever.  Not only were they attentive, but they were fun and had us laughing.  They seemed to know many of the other patrons by name which suggested these were regular customers.

Non-pretentious, great food, sincere and friendly service....there is a reason this place has been around so long. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant... Though the wall paintings are far from perfect, it really adds to the atmosphere. Kudos to that!! 

The food is pretty good, especially their escargot and lamb!! There is no foie gras on menu which is a disappointment and the paté is just supermarket quality. As for desserts, we tried the torte and tartufo. They were delicious. My Mom ordered the crème brûlée which was not the best she's had.... If anything she'd know because that's the only dessert she orders if crème brûlée is on the menu!!

A personal dislike here: I have trouble going to a \"French\" restaurant where no one, not even the chef himself, can speak French. Italian restaurants I can understand... but French?!? No!!!"}
