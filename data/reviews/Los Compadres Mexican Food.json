{"text":"Delicious simple mexican food. Super casual and quick-no serve staff, pick up ur tray of food yourself place. Beer and wine. Refried beans are perfect! Machaca beef and salsa is really good. Love this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and always want to find a place to get my sopapilla fix, since you can't get them in California. Found this place on YELP and was not disappointed.   Not super fancy, but great traditional options and very yummy tamale with a unique creamy sauce."}
{"text":"I have been going to Los Compadres for most of my life and it's always been the same - OUTSTANDING.   The restaurant is family owned, friendly, incredibly laid back., and they serve the tastiest, most authentic Mexican food north of the border.  Honestly, their beans are so DELICIOUS that I very rarely even order meat in my burritos.  On the rare occasion that I mix it up, I always go for the one and only green chile.   If you are in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley area.....RUN, don't walk, to Los Compadres."}
{"text":"Like most places reviews on Yelp in Phoenix, this place is over rated. Okay, it's cheap. Which is great if you just want to eat, but it's nothing special. Found it pretty boring and plain. The interior resembled a jail cell and felt dirty. Won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service excellent food... Michael's amazing customer service excellent perfect... we definitely recommend...."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for take out mexican food. Great prices and really good food. I order my son the baby plate for less than $2 and he gets a heap of rice and beans and some shredded chicken. I love the chicken taco with a ton of salsa. Hubby is a green chili kind of guy and always gets a green chili burro. Fresh chips are an added bonus even though you do have to pay extra for them. The refried beans do have lard so we always order the whole beans and they are excellent."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant for over 30 years!!!   It's not just the delicious food but the staff and the owner.  They are my 2nd family!!!!  Jena is always a joy to see and goes above and beyond the call of duty with every customer.  She has a smile on her face, makes you feel welcome and hustles back in that kitchen like a BOSS!!!!  Danny.....well he is the BEST!  My daughter and I adore him and appreciate the kind, caring service he has given us for years!!!!  It's our \"happy place\" for food, great ambiance and smiling faces!!! Los Compares 7th Ave."}
{"text":"This place actually has good Mexican food, well, for Arizona that is.  It's far from the fabulous Tex-Mex I love so much, but it's the most decent place i've found here so far.  Big portions and very economical.  You should definetely give it a try........."}
{"text":"Their tacos are the way mom would make them if she were Mexican and was the most amazing cook ever.  The take the filing, put it in a corn tortilla and deep fry the whole thing. Oh. My. Gosh. Just amazing. I have never eaten anything else here. The tacos are just too amazing to try anything else. I always get the shredded beef.  I don't live in PHX anymore, but every time I am here I make my way over to 7th Ave. and Indian School. It's a bit of heaven.  Note: this place ain't fancy in the slightest."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Sonoran Mexican food you're going to find in Phoenix.  My family has been going there since before I was born and I love that it hasn't changed a bit.  Their salsa is absolutely perfect, from the heat to the squeeze bottle, there's nowhere better.  We go at least 2 or 3 times a month and will never get tired of Los Compadres."}
{"text":"I must confess I've only tried this place ONE time. I was so un-impressed I have never bothered to go back.  Someone at my table actually commented that it tasted like there were white people in the kitchen trying to make Mexican food !!  Now that is just wrong and bad manners but unfortunately it was true.  I'm not even sure I'd ever give this place a second try.  It does seem to be a popular place though as every time I pass by it is packed on the weekends.  Maybe the customers have never had REALLY good Mexican food and don't know any better ??!!??"}
{"text":"Los Compadres is a family favorite and in some cases our traditional post-holiday restaurant. The food is great, the staff is friendly and the salsa in and of itself makes up for the semi-dilapidated decor.   Love it."}
{"text":"I found this place while driving up 7th Avenue.  I stopped in and picked up some food.  I came back again the next day!  This place is super divey, but serves up excellent versions of the classic Sonoran style Mexican food that I love so much....and it is incredibly cheap!  I was surprised to see the cheap prices, and even more surprised that the food turned out to be so delicious!  The crispy beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are excellent versions of the classics.  Their green chile beef is divine, but I do wish they had green enchilada sauce in addition to the red version, but nonetheless, it was still tasty!  Oh, and the cheese crisp....so crispy, so cheesy, and held up all the way back to my office!  But one of my true barometers of good Mexican food is the beans...and let me just say....their beans are everything beans should be; creamy, salty and rich....they are AMAZING!  This is not very far from my office...which may cause me to visit more frequently than I should....but at these prices...the only thing that will suffer is my waistline!"}
{"text":"My meal which was Green chili burrito and tamale with red sauce was OK and I would order the burrito again.... the waiter was very good, but someone else had fish tacos and they were not great... the Margaritas were VERY good for $1.99... I thought they'd be watered down and they were NOT!!"}
{"text":"My wife turned me on to this gem. Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints. The machaca is moist not wet like many others. The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere."}
{"text":"For the money I guess it's pretty good.  Not really identifiable as Mexican food though. When food arrived it was a mystery. Tamale? It's hidden somewhere under the gluggy white sauce. And enchiladas the same but with a strange red sauce. First bite was surprisingly good but then subsequently lost its appeal. I guess I should have had the fried cheese but, did not know until I saw it go out, then read the reviews. Plus side was the super hot servers."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since High School and I'm 64 years old. I've been friends of the family since then. I have never had a bad meal here since then. Especially the cheese crisps, the green corn tamales, Tacos, enchiladas and burros washed down with a cold beer. Btuc49"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Phoenix!!!! My family and close friends have been eating at \"los\" since 1969. We love it. The food is so good and always consistant. It reasonably priced, and if you like a fast in and out meal try it.  YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!! My sister gets # 1, I get #6, and leesa gets a bean burrow enchilata style. Oh yes and uncle vic gets  # 9.  YUMMY"}
{"text":"This is additional review. It's getting so bad here I might just start going to La Pi√±ata or Via De Los Santos for my fix. My order is consistently made wrong here. Unreal! Where is the Los Compadres that I love? Let me start by saying this is my favorite place to eat anywhere in the world and I've been eating here for 25+ years. There is no consistency to the food anymore. I eat the same thing every time and it never seems to come out the same way anymore. Since the owner who seemed to be in charge passed away it has gone down hill. Service is average when it's good and awkwardly bad most of the time. I wish someone wanted to actually run this place. If it closes Phoenix will lose a gem and most people from Central Phoenix will shed a tear. Sadly the family that owns it doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"The food is exactly what you'd expect, no better no worse. It's guilty pleasure food. The service however leaves quite a bit to be desired. I don't eat here often and it's only because of the service. When I called, the person who took my order seemed utterly confused about what I was ordering off the menu. Totally understandable if he was new, we've all been there, but when I actually got there, the order was entered incorrectly and three times and they hadn't stared making it. I had to explain he order again and then they started it (over $60 for one  All the food was average except for the sopapillas.  No idea what those were. Flat, hard, and burned to a crisp.  After another frustrating experience, it will take a while for me to go back"}
{"text":"Los Compadres is a local favorite of mine.  It's located in a rather small building that used to be a house, but it's been around for years and I'm sure it will be around many more.  I personally love the red chile burros and oh man, don't even get me started on their salsa.  I hate going to a Mexican food restaurant and their salsa tasting like spaghetti sauce.  Theirs is one of my favorites and I usually have to get more chips so I can enjoy more salsa.  Los is authentic, delicious, fast and affordable.  The staff is really straight to the point (get your order, give you your drink...).  Overall, if you have a brain and want great Mexican food, EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Like William T. I too have been coming here since high school. I'm 52.  I made a special trip to pick up some take out from them. 9 miles round trip. Highly disappointed on all levels. I called to express my disappointed and the attitude I received from Hannah...I was a little taken back. Sorry to report today was the last day for me and my husband at Los. Who packs a tostada on top of enchiladas covered in sauce?!?! My tostada was so soggy it was disgusting. AND who packs all the heavy items on top of a flimsy box containing an open face cheese crisp so the cardboard is sticking to the cheese!! Eww!  My tamale was dry, I didn't even bother tasting the enchilada, it looked dry too. Way too many other Mexican restaurants to choose from within 2 miles of my house including Carlos O'Briens. I'll just remember the good ole days when the food and service was good at Los."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 29 years.  Since I was in preschool!!!  This place never disappoints.  Mexican comfort food at its best.  I just moved back to Phoenix after being in LA for 4 years and Los Comp was the very first place I went to in order to remember Home."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Los Compadres by a work friend about five years ago.  I am a Phoenix native and was instantly sad I didn't know about the place sooner in my life after I tried the food.    I consider myself a bean aficionado (I'm serious) and the beans here are so good.  I love the whole bean burrito so much!  My husband and I have tried many other items here as well.  The quesadillas are so good-just the right amount of cheese and the tortillas are great.  The beef machaca tacos, chicken flautas, and chile rellenos are delicious.  My husband thinks the salsa has a strange mint taste but I absolutely love it!  I use it as a salad dressing when I get the #14.  I do wish they had horchata but that is certainly not going to keep me from enjoying the yumtastic food here.  Good prices, food, and service make Los Compadres a four star place."}
{"text":"Simple, straighforward mexican food...with no frills ! I love the chicken tacos, the 3-way burro enchilada style, the chees crisps, the Bean Tostada w/guacamole and the bean burro. Next time you go, notice that the salsa has just a  slight hint of mint - love it ! I've been going there since the tacos were 25c each and have never been disappointed...give it a try"}
{"text":"You walk into this place and it's hot. The building itself is nothing to look at, like many local Mexican restaurants it is a bit run down and sparse inside. I have only had the tacos here, but they were really good. The shell is deep fried and probably the best part, but the rest of it was fresh and good as well (lettuce isn't limp and the tomatoes looked good too). Overall if you are looking for a local place to eat for lunch I would recommend this."}
{"text":"Try the bean burrito with extra butter and salsa!  THEE best in town!!  Been going here since 1974 and in 1997 moved an hour away so it became the half way meeting point for all our family.  The day I moved from my native AZ after 50 years of living in the Valley of the blazing hot sun....my oldest son showed up with a going away gift for mom....a plain brown bag of food?  My fav...a Los Compadres bean burrito w/extra butter and their fab salsa.  Now Los is a 7 hour drive from my house but you can bet we'll be there every time we visit Phx!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food you can get in Phoenix. They've been in business 60 years so they've got to be doing something right. The chips are hot and just slightly greasy. The salsa is hot but still has great flavor. The guacamole on the chimichanga is thick and creamy. You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent! I spoke with Tera to cater in for a meeting and she was amazing! I must say the food is also delicious.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We never remember the name,  but our pet name for it is the paper plate restaurant.  LOVE this place!  Everyone we've taken here loves it and always goes back.  The food is FANTASTIC ! We heard there are sister resturants in Globe and Miami, AZ..... So off we drove!  This is a must!    My favorite is the green chili tostada.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since high school, so i can safley say bout 35 years. The food is still as good as it was when 15 of us would jump into Smitty's vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break. (West high of course) It has been owned by the same family since it opened in the early 1800's!!! Yes the cheese crisp are awesome but the tacos not the shredded beef but the regular tacos are the best in town. Order a couple they are sooo good. Love you Los."}
{"text":"A staple in my life!  My wife turned me onto this place 23 years ago and have been hooked on it ever since.  She grew up a couple of blocks from here and has not forgotten about it.  The food is always so good!  My favorite is the Chili Rellano plate, but always start off with a cheese crisp!  Want your food fast, want some good tasting Mexican food, this is where you want to be!"}
{"text":"The place is a dump, the workers are either idiots or rude. Inconsistent, all beans and no meat, staff is clueless. Typical"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood staple! I have gone to both locations since I was a little girl and I just love the family-owned, authentic food.  The salsa is great, and often we just get it to go to have on hand at our home!  I love the mini lunch plate options, it's just the right amount of food and you get to try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since 2012.  Said the only thing I would go back for is the shredded beef tacos.  Well nothing has changed food is lousy and staff is rude..I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star ratings for this place.  This use to be one of the best Mexican food places in town.  My family has come here since the 60's."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  I don't go nearly as often as I'd like, but when I do, the enchiladas, cheese crisp with green chiles, and the chimichanga are my favorites. Even though its so busy it can be unnerving, if you get a seat, take your time with your food, they won't rush you out of there.  mmmm"}
{"text":"This place sucks... They could literally not try any less .  The Decore is dark and dreary. Would not recommend ."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since i was shitting my diapers, that is many moons of Mexican goodness.  Los is no revelation to the cuisine of Mexico but is without a doubt solid, fresh, and tasty food. If you go for breakfast the Huevos are pretty epic, if it is lunch make sure to get the huge cheese crisp slathered with fresh guac. Everything else is completely solid but traditional for American Mexican food. They make there own fresh tortillas which are delicious."}
{"text":"The best shredded beef taco I have ever had in my life. The 3way burrito is another favorite. This is my favorite Mexican food place in the world!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time i have been here. Once for dinner and this time for lunch. It is absolutely fantastic!!   I have lived by this restaurant for  14 years and just recently discovered it.    Wow,  , Delicious,  tasty and incredibly good.   Even the chips and Salsa are so good.  They brew Coffee for me, which is my most favorite beverage with Mexican Food.    Coffee really enhances the flavor of the spices. I absolutely love this fabulous place. It is spotlessly clean as well and smells really good inside.    Lots of parking in the back of the building. Bathrooms are very clean. Nice and cool inside even though it was 112 degrees outside, yes and it is not even Summer yet."}
{"text":"NEVER, NEVER BUY A TAMALE FROM LOS COMPADRES.  NEVER.  They are all dough an no filling.  They are a disgrace to Mexican food.  I have had the same experience year after year. Tonight I gave them one more chance.  It was my FINAL tamale from this restaurant, never, never again.  NOW AS TO THE REST OF THE FOOD from Los Compadres is outstanding.  It is consistently good, and I will continue to eat food from their restaurant, just not their tamales.  How they can make such superb Mexican food and as the same time make such rotten tamales is beyond me."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best.  It's like they don't even try.  There are so many better choices."}
{"text":"Los Compadres is an A-ok place to stop and have some A-ok Mexican food. You order via a friendly counter service and they give you a number. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. They were good! Nothing fancy or spectacular, just straightforward. I wished for a little more flavor in the chicken, but it wasn't horrible. I also ate Ayesha's leftovers the next day... solid.   If you're looking for a spot that's a bit \"hole in the wall\" simple Mexican, then Los Compadres is the spot for you! I would gladly return and try their other entrees!"}
{"text":"I am very lucky to have Los compadres within walking distance from my house. This is one of my favorite places for the quality of food and great service. I always have a smile on my face when eating here."}
{"text":"Food isn't too bad but I will never come here again because after we ate we used the restroom and both the men and women's bathroom have cockroaches. So freaking gross."}
{"text":"I haven going here for years only due to the short distance from my home. I will NOT being going back due to the rude service I recently experienced. There are way better places around now anyway, I will just give my business to places that appreciate your business."}
{"text":"It's OK. I would expect better considering this is Phoenix AZ, and mexican food places are all over."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Phoenix, we have looked forever and tried many places but this is the place!  The salsa, I could drink it! Its SO FREAKING GOOD. And the rest of their food is the same! Prices reasonable as well. Cannot wait to go back when I have my Mexican food crave!"}
{"text":"Three way burro. Enchiladas. Chile Relleno. Beans and rice. Cheese crisps. All delish. This is my first stop when I come into town and it never disappoints. Can't attest to ambiance or service for dining in because we always take out, but food is always hot, ready when they say it would be, and we always have an ample supply of home made hot sauce to take home. Can't beat the prices or the authenticity."}
{"text":"This place has completely gone downhill. Every time I go, I instantly regret the amount of money I've wasted. The flavor of the food has gone down over the years which saddens me because I've been going since I was little. They've had the same cook for a while now. I don't know what's going on! I watched him make my enchiladas. He grabbed a corn tortilla and a handful of cheese and threw it in the microwave. After the cheese melted, he poured red sauce on it and that's it. Everything is bland. I wouldn't be surprised if they closed down soon. It's so disappointing. I didn't even bother taking a photo of my food."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this restaurant, so part of the attraction is how close it is....but the food is really great too!!! Not only is the food really good but it is reasonably priced. There are awesome combinations, the enchilada's are great (both red and green), the green chile burrito is super yummy too. Number 9 Combinaciones is perfect, a burrito (red or green) a taco (chicken is great) and an enchilada, I get machaca beef for the burro and enchilada....mmmmmmmm!  I actually have to stop myself eating there on both my days off, so instead I just get waaaay to much one day and have leftovers the next!"}
{"text":"I visited los Compadres 2 days ago, i ordered a couple things one being a bean and cheese burrito huge mistake cause for 3.50 you should get some thing bigger than taco bell size burrito. I saw the burrito and told them i needed some thing else and they did just that for me i was pleased after that. Food had good flavor and customer service was great ! JUST STAY AWAY FROM THE BEAN BURRITOS PLEASE THERE A WASTE OF MONEY."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Inexpensive, local, and comforting Mexican fast food. Unlike many of the other quickie burrito joints in town, Los Compadres has a little more to offer along the lines of slow food. Their green and red chile are so tasty and the meat is so tender. I often go with the machaca burritos or enchilladas and an horchata. I've heard their soups are also tasty and their menudo has even gotten my friend's Mexican granny's stamp of approval. A friend of mine jokes that the cheese crisp is totally for non-Mexicans, but slap some avocado on that and we order it every time."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible.  I got the food from Grubhub and they called the manager who was very rude to them and would do nothing about it. I personally called the restaurant and David, the \"manager\" was incredibly rude and said I couldn't prove the food was bad.  I even provided pictures to Grubhub and he said it couldn't be proven.  The food was microwaved and tacos were like leather.  The nachos were soggy and disgusting.  This place should not be in business and David the manager should not be managing anyone besides himself.  Worst experience possible."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in after driving by for years, wish I would of came by years ago! Great food in an original atmosphere.   The food had good taste, guacamole was fresh made and awesome, cheese crisps are wonderful, and the burrito was filling to the point I needed to take it home.   Service was fast and friendly with no issues."}
{"text":"I don't know if they were having a bad day,but when I went for the first time...it took 20 min to get my to go food...then when I got it...it was cold!!!....the taco was ok...rice and beans what a joke!"}
{"text":"I came here last week during my lunch break with my husband and the guy working at the counter, white, was really rude. My husband went to the bathroom so I ordered for him. When I had asked a few questions he responded in a rude sarcastic tone. He stank of body odor, has he never heard of a shower or at least deodorant?  I honestly thought he had a terrible day that day but when we came in today he had the same attitude and the same b.o.   On the other hand the girl working with him, red hair with green eyes, was on the top of her game, she's really sweet and nice and had helped me with the questions I needed with no problem. I also saw her clean tables and restock the utensils while the guy was on his phone. I honestly feel bad that she has to work with him.  The food was great! The salsa was amazing! I had the chili relleno with a corn cheese crisps. My husband had a number 9 with a red burrito.  The food is really filling and worth it for the price. We had tons of leftovers. The teas are the best and they have free refills on drinks and chips!   The place does look a bit sketchy from the outside and in. But please don't let it fool you.  Giving this a 4 star because of the customer service. Don't order from the guy!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Cheese crisp is phenomenal! But prices are too expensive for a slightly higher than mediocre plate."}
{"text":"This place IS  the BOMB!!!!!! One of the many things I miss growing up in Phoenix.. their famous Cheese Crisp--a MUST..I have been ordering the Bean Burro Enchilada style most of my life---their Grandmothers recipe of many years.. They do not dissappoint"}
{"text":"I Heart Los!!!  This is my absolute favorite Mexican Joint!!   Lite A with chicken and a pepsi.....mmmmmm heaven."}
{"text":"Typical bland Phoenix style Mexican food.  It wasn't fantastic and wasn't awful.  I had the Relleno and Enchilada platter.  The enchilada had way too much red sauce, and the relleno had cheddar cheese-I'm use to having it with asadero.  The Caldillo sauce had greasy ground beef in it.  Would of been 10x better without the ground beef (Gosh at least I hope it was ground beef).  The rice was standard Macayo/Garcias type and the beans were really good.  I would go back but not on my oh my gosh I have to go there again list."}
{"text":"For what it is, Los Compadres is great. The place is small (looks like it was once a house) and not the place for a bitrthday party or celebrating a co-worker's borthday or anything, but great for a cheap weeknite din-din. Looks kinda shabby-chic inside but I looked around pretty intensely and it was actually VERY clean inside.    The whole dealio is very \"no frills\"  the food and utensils are disposable and they process are very cheap for pretty good Mexican.   My better half and I each got the same chili relleno commbo platter.  Everything was hot, savory and delicious. Fast service, cute staff and cheap eats."}
{"text":"the only thing i can review is the bean and cheese burrito, because that's all i get and it's all i ever need.  their refried beans are the creamiest, most savory in all of phoenix (i would except for casa reynoso, except this is owned by the same family!).  i can't even find words for much i enjoy their perfect tortillas. but i can say that i can gobble a burrito up in about 45 seconds, and i am the world's slowest eater.   true story."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The set up is weird. If you are looking for a no frills Mexican restaurant with good food at a low price, Los Compadres is a safe choice as long as you don't mind the hustled atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok, new review. As mentioned place can be hit and miss. Dont know if management has changed but certainly some new faces.  All good with that except when I call ahead for a to-go order, am told 25 min, show up and then am told 'sorry about that it never got entered, I will put it in right now ahead of others'.  Wow, thanks. How about 'hey, we messed up and I will comp you one of the two dinners'.  Really crappy customer experince. Need to find a new mex joint. Peace out mi amigos."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie--when America's Taco Shop opened right down the road, I really thought this little local take-out place would quickly go out of business. I was gladly mistaken.  No frills Mexican food. Expect your sit down meal to include plastic forks and paper plates--but if you're looking for good Mexican food at a great price...YUM! Good service too.  #11 with an  enchilada $4.65  :)"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. It took forever to get the food, even when we were the only people there! Our food had no flavor, and there was no atmosphere. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years, and liked their food, but it wasn't my favorite. But, all this time I didn't order the right way. I ordered the green chili Chimichanga enchilada style... omg, it was amazing! Also, Los Compadres has choice of red sauce or green chili meat sauce...I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that had both. It came with rice and beans too! Delicious! Well, I didn't care to much for the beans, to thick for me and they tasted a bit sour... was a little afraid to eat them... chips great! Salsa yummy! Service great! plus, I tested the 3 way Burro and it was soooo yummy!!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about this place!! It is fantastic, delish, cheap, clean....all of the above!  I have been coming here for about 35 years now. I keep coming back and look forward to every visit. We came here today for a late lunch, early dinner. We were greeted by a really happy crew, (so nice).They made us new fresh coffee and i great Ice Tea, with big fresh lemons. The Beef and the Chicken were great as well as the Pork. The Tacos are probaly the best i have ever had. We were happy we ate early because, you are full for the rest of the night. Free refills on the Coffee and the Ice Tea. Location is an old house on 7th Ave, which is a really great idea, with lots of parking in the lot. If you have never tried it, you really should. You would not be sorry, plus it is a great price, you have nothing to loose."}
{"text":"Really great food, really terrible ambience. I recommend getting it to go because sitting down to eat will just depress you.   When we walked in I thought that the place was under construction as it was nearly empty, consisting only of a few cheap table on a concrete floor. No music, no tv, nothing on the walls. It was nearly empty and nearly silent, not a good first sign.  Despite this poor first impression we decided to stay and eat. I am very glad that I decided to give the place a second chance because the food is both tasty and reasonably priced. Their chicken is well seasoned and moist so get that.  Pros: Good food, good prices  Cons: Order at the counter, zero ambience"}
{"text":"A delicious Carne Asada burrito. I can't wait to go back and trust me it will be soon."}
{"text":"You can judge a Mexican restaurant by its salsa and beans, and both are GREAT here! It's in an old house, and I've been coming here for twenty five or so years. Visit every time I'm home for the holidays."}
{"text":"Ate here this weekend and what a disappointment! I used to come here with co-workers all the time and our experience was always a good one. Now mind you, this place is essentially a take out joint. So, I went to the take out section of the restaurant where they also have tables and ordered my meal. I couldn't help but a notice a VERY LARGE glass enclosed \"tip\" container.  I was instantly put off, but decided to save my overall opinion for after my meal arrived. I ordered my food from a young woman who not only failed to greet me, but seemed very annoyed to have to come to the counter and wait on me.  (I asked to \"dine in\" but you still have to order at the counter and pick it up at the counter. Nobody waits on you.) So I placed my order and waited. The cheese crisp was so burnt in sections I couldn't eat it, and the salsa they gave me was so watery I stopped putting it on my chips because it was making them soggy.  The taco was good. The overall experience was not good though, and the tip jar at the counter really blew my mind. That's like tipping at McDonald's. TACKY!!! What the hell happened to this place? I guess the owners just don't care anymore. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is pure trash. I ordered something so basic, a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with sour cream. How could you possibly mess that up?  The tortilla was tough and the sauce had a funky taste to it. It took forever for service as well. I thought I would be walking into a real restaurant, but I could get tastier food from Filberto's!  Never again!"}
{"text":"I would like to preface my review with a little background on me. I was born in Phoenix 33 years ago. Over the years I have tried hundreds (if not thousands) of Tex-Mex restaurants in Phoenix, the U.S. Southwest, and Mexico itself.   The first Tex-Mex I ever had was at this Los Compadres. I have had everything on the menu more than 20 times. How I feel about the food at the 7th Avenue Los Compadres I can only relate in analogy. It is Garfield's lasagna, Bert's oatmeal, Laestrygonian's lotus, Olympian Ambrosia, and Elvis's peanut butter and banana freakin' sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito, and gilded.  Do not get this and the sister restaurant confused. There is NO substitute."}
{"text":"Mel rose St Fair was jammin' and gave us the opportunity to duck into Los Compadres for eats. Previous reviewers helped me out and I went straight for the cheese crisp with chili strips. Their kitchen was great and delivered the crisp light on cheese, as ordered. My beau tried the remaining of the menu; taco, tamale, and green chili enchilada. His dishes were OK.  Tamales don't compete with local fare.  Beans are definitely good. Restaurant is clean. Just not spicy enough for us."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I just went there and it was horrible!  It was dirty and the food basically sucked.  We had the Taco and Enchilada combo and 2 tacos.  I took 2 bites and couldn't finish.  The Enchilada was soggy and flavor was worse than put of a can.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, unfortunately.  Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Los Compadres has pretty good food. However, the customer service is seriously lacking! When I called in an order to pick up my lunch today - the lady I spoke with was very short and unfriendly. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and some chips and salsa. I told her specifically I did NOT want beans and rice - She responded with \"Okay\". When I arrived (not greeted/welcomed) and received my food, it was more expensive than the menu lead me to believe. I mentioned it to her after she took my card (in a hurry) and she told me it's because I ordered rice and beans. I was instantly irritated and said calmly that I told her over the phone I did not want B&R. She didn't seem to care, and responded with \"Oh, I didn't hear you say that\" She also told me that my Chips & Salsa were in the bag - I should have checked!  I just decided to take the hit and go. When I got to work and opened the bag, there were no chips. I thought about calling. However, since I said something earlier about being charged for something I DID NOT order and she didn't offer a refund or anything else. I decided it was pointless to call. I will not be returning to or recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the first day of my life I swear I was born right in the doorway (side door not front entrance) I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed They're making burritos within my reach  Yours is the first face that I saw I think I was bland before I met you Now I don't know where I am I don't know where I've been But I know where I want to go (Los Compadres)  And so I thought I'd let you know That lunch specials take a couple minutes I especially am slow But I realize that I need Los And I wondered if I could come home (side door not front entrance)  Remember the time you drove all night Just to feed me in the morning (two bean burritos with cheese) And I thought it was strange you said everything changed You felt as if you'd just woke up And you said \"this is the first day of my life I'm glad I didn't die before I fed you But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you And I'd probably be happy\"  So if you want to eat with me With this menu there's no telling We just have to wait and see But I'd rather be working for a paycheck Than waiting to win the lottery Besides maybe this time is different I mean I really think you like me When my face is stuffed full with a chimi"}
{"text":"Been going here for years, food today was just ok.... But i also think the people that work their could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Visiting from California for the sister in laws graduation and the family was hungry. Decided we try and get some Mexican food. Came across this place because of the 4 stars. Ordered the carne asada burrito with rice and beans. Expecting a bomb ass burrito, packed with steak, rice and beans inside of it. Instead what I got was burned steak packed into a flour tortilla with a plate of rice and beans on the side. We were hella hungry so I didn't care and ate it. Apart from that they forgot my brother in laws order. Being Mexican, this food was disappointing. If you want some real burritos, come to California."}
{"text":"The food is homemade and if you are a salsa connoisseur - you have to eat here! Thin chips and fresh salsa. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars?  Freakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!  So, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering. I just wanted to try so many different thingsssss  I got: Cheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamole Mini green chile chimichanga 1 cheese enchilada Side order of refried beans Chips and salsa  All that food... .$15 And it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.  I loved everything... EVERYTHING I SAY!  And that's truly a rarity."}
{"text":"if you grew up on 1970's style mexican food, then this is your dream come true.  enchilada sauce the way its supposed to look and taste.  ditto on the green sauce.  tamales green or red are fresh.  they still call em \"cheese crisps\".  if you love baja fresh or rubios, then you're barkin up the wrong tree."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. It's my favorite Mexican restaurant and I always visit when I come to Phoenix from Denver. Sadly, the impetus of my review today is a complaint. Before we were able to order another patron was checking on the status of their order. Angel, the woman at the counter assured her it would be ready in five minutes and that it was delayed \"because you had a big order.\" We then watched Angel print the patrons ticket, give it to the kitchen and asked for it to be rushed.   Sometimes things fall through the cracks but the right thing to do here is to admit the mistake... Not flat out lie. I really hate liars."}
{"text":"Green Burrito and Guacamole Tostada. That's what I get every time. I've had them dozens of times. Rich and unique flavor, great pico and hot sauce flavors! Also my favorite cheese crisp on the planet. The best cheese!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only mexican food place i eat at- although it is alittle sketchy on the outside and inside too, it is the definition of a \"hole in the wall\"   Amazing food , i genuinly enjoy it!   styrofoam plates and plastic spoons tho? tisk tisk  the staff is alittle weird - but always very friendly!  over all very good!"}
{"text":"My cousin lives across the street from Los Compadres. I was starving and decided to give it a shot. I called and placed my order to go. A red chile burrito with a side of cheese and sour cream. I got there and was shocked my burrito was only $5! Usually restuarants charge an arm and a leg for side items. I asked the girl for an iced tea to go and she gave it to me for free! I thought that was really sweet of her so I gave her a nice tip. I was very pleased with my food and I would't hesitate to come back. The restaurant isn't fancy just a good solid place to get cheap tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"Mediocre and cafeteria-like Tex Mex served on styrofoam plates. Slow service. Dingy interior. With many options for this cuisine all over the metro area, it seems a shame to waste a lunch here. Salsa is good, though."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was in the womb. It is my favorite mexican food in AZ.  Nothing is very hot but everything is super tasty.  I love the cheese crisp...very crispy and the green chili burro.  They put a little bit of cheese inside the green chili burro...mmmm.  Also the salsa is sooo good. I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some FAST authentic,  old-school, old-Phoenix style Mexican food in Central Phoenix, this is the place.  Walk in.  Look up at menu. Go to the counter.  Order.  They hand you a drink-- they brew their own tea, you can get a beer, soda, whatever.  Pay.  Sit.  Oh So Fast, they'll call your number and you walk up and get a cafeteria style tray with your order.  Mini bean burritos on the lunch plate- yum!  Awesome cheese crisp with guacamole!  Fast. Cheap.  Good choice!  No real ambiance, but that's OK, you're not there for the faux finished walls and water feature anyway."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The staff are very nice but the tables are basic no frills.  We passed around orders of chicken chimichanga (added guacamole and some if their salsa=delicious), machaca taco, green chile burro and tostada.  So good it got us cussing out and wishing for more.  One of my favorite Mexican food places in Arizona (and I've sampled a lot)."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this establishment for many many years. The food is very good! I have absolutely no complaints about the quality or cleanliness of this place. But I do have one complaint that needs to be addressed. At some point during that last several months, not sure exactly....they got a new system to take orders, pay, etc. It looks like a large tablet on a stand. After ordering and paying, either by card or cash, the employee will then flip the tablet towards you with several options to tip them; starting with 17% an up. Seriously? I just placed my order. You have done nothing YET to earn said tip! This is becoming an annoying issue every time we come here. There is also a tip jar on the counter. They need to stick with JUST the tip jar, so people can actually WAIT until AFTER they have brought your food to the counter for you  to walk up and get. Fyi, this is  a counter service restaurant! I'm not saying that the counter service doesn't require a tip, but we shouldn't be pressured into giving a tip before we have even sat down for the meal."}
{"text":"In the area visiting and wanted Mexican food.  Reviews were good therefore gave it a try.  At first, the place was not what I expected.  Instead of being seated and served, you order at a counter and wait for a number to be called.    We ordered cheese crisps - a baked flour tortilla with melted cheese - essentially an open face quesadilla.  It was very good.  We ordered tamale, enchiladas (red chile), carne asada and green chile tamales. All were good except the asada was a little dry.  We finished with sopapillas with honey.  These were very good as well.  I wish we could find these in California.  Overall,  the food was good to very good. Four stars due to the dry carne asada.  Large portions of food and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Super crispy cheese crisp, massive amounts of cheese and green chiles.. creamy, smoky enchilada sauce.. incredibly yummy red chile (smooth, creamy and tender).. great portions and low prices.. Ill certainly keep coming here!!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I wasn't too impressed with this place.  When you dine in the seating isn't the most comfortable (I'm a booth kind of girl), and they give you a squeeze bottle of hot sauce for your chips instead of salsa (I'm also a salsa kind of girl).  However, my fiance and I have been ordering take out from here quite a bit lately.  I like the bean and cheese burritos and the tacos., and the little plastic cups of salsa that they give out are super good.  Why they don't just serve that salsa in the restaurant is beyond me.  So, the place has some good staples, but it's a more of a take out kind of place in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was less than spectacular....i had the carne asade burro.  The meat was extremely cold, chewy and lacked seasoning.  I would not come here again for the food.  However, the guy working the register was really sexy, friendly and helpful.  I may go again just to buy a bottle of water so I can see him but otherwise I won't be ordering food. lol"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!  We drive the twenty plus miles to go here, because it is worth it.  Service and the food are consistent.  The feel, is an older adobe home with a lot of character.  No, complaints other than it is a short red-eye from the house.  Cheese Crisp!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had in Phoenix (probably anywhere to be honest).  This is my family's go to Mexican restaurant.  I get the Carne Asada burro everytime, my wife gets the Chimichanga.  I love their chips and salsa. Usually great service, although every once in a while it's a miss. They have a good happy hour too, good margaritas.  Prices are very fair, easy to eat under $10 regardless of time of day. Of course you can spend more if you'd like.  This restaurant has been here for decades which speaks volumes to the quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the enchilada! It's huge I always get it with ground beef. Side of jalapeno! Thx to a staff member recommendation:)"}
{"text":"Been going here for many years.  They have the best salsa, beans, and shredded beef!  Love the burritos and tacos!"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened in 1958, and I can see why it's still in business 56 years later! Los Compadres (we call it 'Old Los' since there was a newer (far less superior) sit-down location that opened on 23th Avenue) has been a dinner destination for my family since I can remember. I've grown up on their chips & deliciously spicy salsa (served up in squirt bottles so you can get it in all the right places) and bean & cheese burritos. In the 20+ years I've been frequenting this restaurant, I've only ventured from my usual a few times. But, throwing in an order of their amazing cheesy and oily 'cheese crisp' on special occasions is a family favorite.  Los Compadres is affordable, laid back, and a great spot for catching up with family and friends. Since you pay upfront at the counter, customers never feel rushed to leave. There have been times where my family and I will spend hours at 'our table' - sometimes we even need to order a few more helpings of chips (50 cents per order)! They also sell their chips and salsa (in pints) to go! Since I start craving it even just a few hours after leaving with a full belly, the to go option is a great plus.  Promise me that you won't go in thinking you'll be treated like royalty and have the chance to dine on tablecloths with fine china. Instead, expect to order at a counter, pick your table, stand up to get your food, and spend the rest of the time squirting salsa onto your delicious meal and catching up with loved ones without having to rush.   Enjoy!! I'm already planning on stopping by for my favorite Mexican food when I'm back in town for Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Kind of run of the mill which isn't necessarily a bad thing. You won't hate your food, but I'm not raving about it. :/"}
{"text":"Loud.  Cheap Mexican food.  Beer.  Better than Mi Patio.  What else yuh wanna know?"}
{"text":"This place is a must go to. I go here atleast once a week. The cheese crisps are phenomenal. My wife and I will come back week after week. The staff is extremely nice and professional. They actually remember your name when you frequent. 5 stars, no question"}
{"text":"Great food, however they changed it up. They no longer allow you to change a lunch menu option to a cheaper menu item. Super annoying as I have been coming for 20 years and then all of the sudden no dice."}
{"text":"Ok I'm just going to break it down: 1. What mexican restaurant doesn't have carnitas? 2. No complimentary chips and salsa with order. 3. Rice is very bland 4. Tamales covered in a green cream sauce, I'm used to the chili verde type. I should have ordered the 'sauce' on the side. 5. Beans were good.  I don't think I will go back any time soon. My palet for authentic mexican food apparently is needing more. There are too many restaurants around here to choose this one. Lo siento Compadres."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 20 years. I love this place! The food is always made to order, quick and delicious. Best time to get there is when they open because the lunch crowd can really pack that tiny place up. I will continue to come here once a month like I usually do."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the last 27 years and it is by far the best Mexican food! We have moved to connecticut and when we come to Arizona Los Compadres is always our first stop. They have the best cheese crisp I have ever had. Their tacos are amazing and the fried ice cream is the best."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Los. It was one of my favorite places for Mexican food. The past few times I have been underwhelmed, unfortunately. Doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food anymore. We head to Mi Patio now when we want our Mex fix."}
{"text":"I heard the hype about this place.  What a disappointment.  Totally over rated!  The food is good, but I've had just as good or better at Filiberto's for less money.  The portions are pretty small in comparison, too.    The order counter is efficient but lacking in personal touch.  The people who take your order can take you or leave you, and seem to never have even heard of the concept of customer service.  As soon as the line for ordering disappears, the staff disappear to the back, so you have to fend for yourself if you need anything once you have ordered or have your food, until they come back 2 years later.    The building looks exactly like what it is: a whole in the wall.  That in of itself is not a bad thing really, and probably part of the charm, but its painted gray and looks depressing.  Inside dining is adequate and utilitarian, but I felt like I was eating at the county jail canteen.  The tables were slightly dirty, like they cleaned off the last customer's food tray and forgot to wipe down the table.  I can't say that I would recommend them, but the food was decent, aside from these issues.  If you got the food to go, and set your expectations low, you won't be too badly disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a restaurant that has ambience, music, nice lighting and gives you a feeling of being welcomed, don't come here. The prices are not cheap enough to warrant such crappy customer service.  And if you're looking for great quality food at affordable prices don't come here either. The food is mediocre at best. This is a walk up to the counter and order. And when your order is ready they simply just yell \"order ready\" The atmosphere is reminiscent of a sad Mexican prison. In short, I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. I grew up in Phoenix and had my first red chile burro at age 3 when the family owned La Palma restaurant on McDowell back in the '50s. I have never eaten a cheese crisp as good as theirs. Their red chile is superb. I moved from Phoenix in 1968 to go to college but come back as often as I can. After 60 years of eating there I never tire of it!"}
{"text":"BEST Mexican food restaurant this side of the Mississippi and this side of the border!!! If I could rate this 100 out of 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall mexican restaurant. I tried the mini chimi chico with machaca beef that was really good! The prices and portion sizes were decent. Everyone kept ordering the cheese crisp that showed up after us. A total of 11 orders of that in the time we sat there. Apparently it's to die for...too bad I had no room to have one myself.  All in all the food and atmosphere was very good.  Will definitely come back and try the cheese crisp. :)"}
{"text":"The carne asada--incredibly plentiful and packed in that burrito--was so dry and tasteless that I am sure it was yesterday's meat.  I ate it, but I was so disappointed in Los Compadres for this. I ordered a carne asada burrito only, but the nice girl at the register gave me free rice and refried beans...maybe to make up for the horrid meat? The orders are big, the guacamole was just excellent, and the salsa is pretty standard and good, but that meat I won't get over soon. Will I try this place again?  Not sure if I would or not at this point.  I guess it depends on if I am starving and super near them. Now, if Los Compadres fixes the meat problem I can overlook their barely passing a Health Code violation old dirt in the corners of the place.  Very disappointed customer here...very...cause I'm a tacqueria fan of these little funky dirty places, ate at tons of them and always get the best food.  But not here this day....damn!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was in high school in the 80's. Love that now I can walk there.   I generally have a taco/tostada here. There enchilada sauce is very good as well. One of my favorite things is the mini chimichanga. It's a realistic size to consume.   The best thing on the menu is the cheese crisp. Also beer is a flat price so choose the import over domestic."}
{"text":"I've always looked forward to going to Los Compadres.  Our last trip to Los Compadres will probably be my last. The enchilada was tough, had to cut it with a knife, the taco must have been left over from lunch. the chips were cold and tasted old.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Established in 1958, Los Compadres has been offering Phoenix classic Mexican food at great prices for over 50 years.  Here you will find the Mexican food standards tacos, nachos, enchiladas, tamales, burros etc. made fresh to order.  In addition, they have egg specialties, salads, charbroiled chicken, and their something different selections...  They have 10 combos that include 2-3 items each for under $8 and lighter combos for under $5.  Los Compadres is a excellent alternative to the fast food chains claiming to serve Mexican food.  Catering services and party trays are also available.  Their hours are Monday through Saturday 10:30am to 9pm and Sundays 10:30am to 7:30pm."}
{"text":"Food is SO good. Love the green chili burrito! They'd be five stars if they had better service."}
{"text":"Hire a busboy! I had to say it. I had to take these pictures. This is my _third_ visit since my May update with the same result and I can't keep it to myself any longer. The staff neglects the dining room. Period. Dot. Patrons often have to move dirty plates, stacking them up on top of trays at another table, just to sit down.  My recommendation to the owners is to put up some garbage bins like all other self-busing fast-food places and make _us_ do it if you're not going to.  I have to wonder what happens to all those half-filled salsa squirt bottles left on the tables unrefrigerated for so long. Do they top off and return them to service, or are they emptied and washed before refilling?  It is my sincere hope that very soon I will be able to update this review again and say that things are back to normal. Until then, I have to advise driving a bit further south to Mi Patio, or north to Sylvia's La Canasta."}
{"text":"I live right behind the 7th ave location and probably eat here more than I would like to admit. The mini combo plates are my go-to and the taco sauce is AMAZING"}
{"text":"It was okay. The beans were good. The rice was undercooked and a bit dry. My ground beef burrito was mostly tortilla and red sauce. The shredded beef taco was dry and underwhelming.  I will not be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"We have been eating at here for 20+ years and it pains me to give this review.  For the last 1-2 years, this place has been steadily declining in service, quality and the overall appearance of the place. The last time we went in, the restaurant was really dirty and don't even try using the bathroom there!  I hope that they do something to change it back because we always loved going there!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Los Compadres since the mid 1960's when we came for lunch in high school. I have not found a better cheese crisp anywhere and having lived in Phoenix for nearly 60 years, I've tried most of them. Be warned though - you have to tell them you don't want burned edges. They do that sometimes. We often do take out here because we live so close. if you're looking for a dining out experience the atmosphere is not that great. We don't mind it and have even had small parties here in the small semi-private room up front. It's our neighborhood spot. Maybe it's because they know us but the service has always been friendly. Sure they mess up our order sometimes but they always give us a credit for a replacement the next time we come in. And we are addicted to their salsa!"}
{"text":"This is a little blink-and-miss-it place in Central Phoenix.  Don't be scared of how it looks on the outside...  You have to try the green chile burro.  Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"great food at great prices. orders made fast. family owned, been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I grew up eating Los Compads at least once a week. It was our favorite family restaurant, and since I moved to Tucson in the 70s, I've eaten there almost every time I've gotten to Phoenix. I'd read that it's changed but I didn't believe it. How could such a great family restaurant change? I don't know but it sure did.   I ate there yesterday and it was so disappointing. I got the combo with taco, enchilada, rice and beans. The taco was shredded beef -- not the great beef they used to have -- and it was dried and gross. But worst of all was the taco was like a baby taco. I'm not kidding, it was maybe 4\" long. Same with the cheese enchilada, which was partially covered by the copious amounts of beans and rice -- obviously the cheap way to go -- so you couldn't tell right away that it was also maybe 4\" long. Salsa was tasteless and the enchilada sauce (always my favorite) was bland.   I took a friend there, so excited to share my favorite Phoenix restaurant. I will say that service was fast and the staff seemed friendly. But the food has gone WAY downhill. Very disappointing and I won't be back. I feel like a big part of my childhood has disappeared. So sad."}
{"text":"I've not been to AZ or Los Compadres for 4 years but when I went last week, it was just as I remember! Wonderful!   Their cheese crisps are amazing (ask them not to burn it). The bean burrito I have been eating for 30 years is still the same awesome bean burrito (with extra butter). Also, the enchilada, tamale and chicken taco was the same. (We got a bunch of stuff & shared.)   I am so happy that Los Compadres has survived the unfortunate deaths of Mrs. Valdivia and her son. Selfishly speaking. It isn't the same not seeing them (and I realize it's been a while) but when I was in my 20s and coming in, I saw her every time, behind the window, being her wonderful self. She left a terrific legacy with Los Compadres."}
{"text":"Food was awful! I had a chili relleno and the cheese enchiladas. The chili relleno was caked under a mess of cheese, ground beef, and what looked to be a green chili concoction. Also they breaded the chili relleno, it was absolutely gross! The cheese enchiladas had no flavor and their red sauce was just bland. The guy behind the counter was white and was sort of an ass when I asked him on what he suggested. The people eating at the establishment were some older white people, so I should have just turned my ass around when I stepped in the door! Rating- \"Is there a minus 5 star rating?\""}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem and authentic Mexican dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here eating a reheated bean and cheese burrito (enchilada style) from Saturday. I usually eat  healthier lunches, but when it comes to Los Compadres my morals are easily compromised.  This location will always hold a special place in my heart. I love that they have not updated the dining rooms, and the 70's charm remains. This is a 5 star joint for me.   Really good Mexican food should have certain characteristics and Los has mastered all of them: The salsa is amazing, spicy, chunky and full of flavor.  They make killer guacamole, no tomatoes!  The cheese crisp are always well done. The carne asada marinade they use is fantastic. It has the perfect blend of spice, tang and citrus.   Just like Paula Dean they know everything but my waistline is better with butter.   No it is not healthy, but they don't claim to be. It is just pure, greasy, cheap Mexican goodness."}
{"text":"Went looking for Carolina's on 16th st and buckeye got there and they were no longer at that location, went in search of a different mexican place and found Los Compadres.    The food here or at least what I ordered was very good. Combo #1 (Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Tostada and an Extra Taco)  I was a bit disappointed as I was lead to believe that the combo came with beans and rice, however my plate was devoid of such fare...which is a large part why i'm only offering 4 stars.  I will eat here again MANY times in the future, so if anyone is in the area or out to try something new this place has pretty amazing food for a decent price.  Oh and one more thing...at first I was a little put off by the salsa, but once I ate it I liked it a lot. The more I ate the more I liked it.  It had a really good flavor and I pretty much wanted to drink it."}
{"text":"Walking around this area with a friend and she suggested we stop here for lunch. I can see why they have been in business for so long. Food was excellent. Interior is nice and cozy. I had combo a (taco, tortilla crisp, enchilada) and everything was so tasty. The guac was also super tasty. Not the best mexican food I have had in the valley, but it is up there. Will be back"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Have not been able to get back for several months.  Went last night, all prices have risen.  Ordered 3 Bean Burros, ($4.25 each!!) 2 tacos, a cheese crisp and a beer. Total was a massive $36 and change!!!!!!  Way more than before and way over priced.  They forgot the cheese crisp.  the cheese crisp is now only a store bought tortilla with melted cheese.  It tasted blah and was a bit 'chewy' which is the opposite of crisp.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"\"Beer is proof that God loves man, and wants him to be happy\" - Benjamin Franklin. I'm not personally religious.. spiritual maybe? But if there is a higher power I would add that beer and Mexican food is the proof. For me this is the ultimate in comfort food. There is nothing that a cheesy greasy plate of Mexican food cant fix... or at least soften the blow.  Over the past months I have subjected myself to countless mediocre mexican experiences. My favorite senoran Mexican place for years has been Carlos O'Briens. I know there HAS to be somewhere out there as good or better. So far its been a disappointing adventure, I have found a few places that had single better items.  Finally I feel as if all these wasted calories finally paid off. Los Compadres.. You have given me hope that I will find what I'm looking for. I walked out of there stuffed, with money left in my wallet, and a big smile on my face. With a few small improvements you would be my new favorite Mexican place.  Chips/Salsa: The salsa was great.. It was a slightly chunkier version of the taco sauce you usually get in the squeeze bottles. The chips were crisp, thin, and lite.. Although I find it hard to explain why they seemed lite when they were a bit on the oily side but somehow they were. Salted well but not overly. Well worth the $1 or whatever it was. Drain them a tad more and you would have perfect chips.  Cheese Crisp: I can't believe I am saying this but I think I have found my new favorite cheese crisp. It was the perfect crispy yet pliable texture. So freaking good I'm not even sure I put salsa on more then a few bites of it. The cheese was amazing.. I think there was butter involved here somewhere. I WANT ONE NOW!!!  Guac: Again.. shocked to say this.. but tied with my current favorite. Not a a tomato to be found. The perfect balance of avocado, garlic, cilantro, peppers for heat, citrus.  Beef Tamale: Not a star.. With all the great food here I would not waste the stomach space.  Shredded Beef Taco: Although we all enjoyed them their are better tacos in the valley. One disappointing note was that right out of the kitchen every taco on the whole table was split down the middle from taco fail. It happens.. I got over it. Saving grace was that they were stuffed then fried.. mmmmmm extra grease :D  Enchilada: Delicious! The corn tortilla was not overpowering with corn flavor. The red sauce here is rich, thick, creamy, and smokey. If they were to salamander the enchiladas with the cheese on them before serving it would kick the ass of every other enchilada I've had in town. Since they use foam plates they can't do this.  Relleno: Finally! This is probably the best senoran style relleno I've had outside of Mexico. I wasn't even a huge fan of the beef green chili on top and it was still amazing. Next time I will order it with the red enchilada sauce for what I'm sure will be the ultimate relleno.. unless you feel like taking a trip to the friendly dolphin in rocky point.  Carne Asada: Chris ordered a Carne Asada burrito. This is not something I usually get unless I'm making it myself or at a *ertos. He offered me a taste.. WHoa! delicious. The marinade on this was amazing. There was a hint of something sweet.. I would guess it had some orange juice or orange slices in the marinade.  Rice: If I had to pick one thing that they absolutely need to improve on its the rice. Although the rice was cooked perfectly. The grains stayed intact and there was no mushiness to it at all. The flavor was just off and not great in general. As weird as it sounds the first few bites I had almost tasted floral. I think they could easily improve on this. This is a really important one guys! fixy please!  Beans: Polar opposite of the rice. I'm not even a huge bean fan and these were great. Creamy, salty, rich, and definitely had some delicious lard in there. Its no wonder its mentioned again and again in the reviews.   Pros: Amazing Combo Prices! Parking Lot (This can be important in this part of town) Plenty Of Tables Quick Service FREAKING DELICIOUS  Cons: Rice Taco Fail Tamale  My Perfect Return Trip Meal: Carne Asada Chili Relleno (Substitue green chili for red enchilada sauce) Enchilada Cheese Crisp + Guac"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch here due to the high Yelp reviews.  You walk up and order your food, pay and pick up the food from the counter when it's ready.  We both ordered the special \"Tostada and red sauce burrito.\"  Surprisingly this  place charges extra for chips and hot sauce/salsa.  When our order arrived I thought that perhaps Los Compradres had  swung by Taco Bell to pick up our order.  Maybe back in the day this place was good, however now it's Taco Bell food at a 500% mark up.  Go somewhere else peops, unless you're looking for over priced Taco Bell food, disinterested staff, and a poor dining environment .  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a hole in the wall type experience. Nothing spectacular to see from the inside or out. Graffiti on the parking lot walls. There is a lack of decor on the interior, but it is very clean. The staff are always very friendly. I've never had bad customer service, which I think is very impressive. They recently raised their prices, but overall still a bargain. The food is DELISH!!! Try the shredded beef chimichanga."}
{"text":"This restaurant lately has not been good . Cheese crisp either burned Or tough . Sat on a side room with Windows that were filled with spiders and overgrown foliage . Too bad because it has long been a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a real, \"authentic\" mexican food place in Phoenix since I moved here a year and a half ago, and this place is the best I've been able to find. The fact that it's about 3 minutes away from my house makes it even better!  The first thing I love about this place is the albondigas soup. It's AMAZING. It's just your basic vegetable soup with carrots, potatoes, celery and squash and best of all, MEATBALLS! The broth is very flavorful and always super hot!  There are whole bunch of things I haven't tried on the menu because I always go for one of the combination plates. I get a mixture of either the enchiladas, tamales, tacos or burros because they're all so equally good! The plate is served with a hefty serving of rice and beans (the rice could maybe use a little work but the beans are great!)   Get an order of chips and salsa! The salsa has this hint of mint to it that I've never tasted before and sometimes I go here just to get chips!!  All in all, great food, GREAT PRICES and great service."}
{"text":"It's ok.  The tacos are good.  The salsa is good.  The enchiladas are not good.  The rice is boring.  The beans are ok.  The tostada was ok.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"Good food must run in the family. A few months back we stopped here by chance and I am so glad we did.  Later, we found out that Los Compadres are cousins to my favorite mexican restaurant Casa Reynoso in Tempe.   So many good things to eat here I just don't know where to start. Here are some items on my favorites list:  The salsa and chips are yum-diggity.  The mexican pizza  Shredded beef taco  Bean/cheese burro (with green chili strips)  Stay away from the red chile. Not that good."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Every time I visit Phoenix I eat here.  This is a no frills restaurant with authentic Mexican food.  The lunch specials are especially good because you get various items in small form so you can try a lot of different things.  I have NEVER had a bad meal here and been eating here for eight years."}
{"text":"Los Compadres is awesome. Seriously. Great Mexican food and great prices from a family owned business.  Although this isn't a full service restaurant, I would still rather eat here than any other Mexican food restaurant in the Valley.  The way it works here is you order at the counter and then they call your number when everything is ready.  They have the best bean burritos known to man here- I dare you to challenge me on this. I know my mom really likes their tacos too, but I haven't tried one myself.  Although I normally come for dinner, they do have some really great lunch specials every day of the week as well. My only regret is that I don't live closer to the splendor that is Los Compadres.  On a side note for those that live in the area: does anyone know the name of the Chinese restaurant next door?  If so, I beg of you, don't eat there. My mom and I were getting out of her car one day to go to Los Compadres and we saw something that haunts us to this day. A driver was unloading what was sure to become someone's Moo Shu Pork, but at that point, they were still whole pigs! Whole pigs uncovered and stacked on top of each other in the back of this dirty delivery truck! I'm talkin' pig on top of pig on top of pig. They had nothing below them, nothing on top of them and nothing to cover them. For God's sake people, these pigs didn't even have saran wrap on them. It really gives new meaning to the word 'swine.' Anyways, even if I've saved just one person from eating at this slum, it will all have been worth it."}
{"text":"Great no frills classic Mexican.   Quick snd friendly service. The younger gal that works the counter is awesome and smoking hot!   One of my favorite quick, casual spots."}
{"text":"Their salsa is addictive and the cheese crisps are amazing.  Their guacamole has a ton of garlic in it, which I love, but may not be to everyone's taste. The kids working in there are always friendly and sweet.  They have a really efficient POS, which you don't always expect to find in an old Mexican restaurant.  We order lunch at work probably twice a month from here.  The only thing that I wish they didn't do is put sauce on the tamales.  I want to unwrap my tamales from the husk.  Oh also their beans and rice are top notch."}
{"text":"Yum.  I haven't had a bad dish here in ten tries, and the chips and salsa are addictive.  What more can you ask for?  Eating there isn't anything special other than the food is piping hot.  The dining area is pretty basic.  I usually get takeout, which survives the five minute drive home just fine.  Winners:  * Mexican pizza, loaded * Green chili anything * Chimichangas * Tacos * Burritos enchilada-style"}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly. 1st time so explained food and options. Good sized portions, yeah I'm too full...Enchilada, bean tostado, green chili, ask really good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I get back to town.  Their beans are the best I've had.  Their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside.  This makes the best product.  All of you lucky enough to live in the state don't realize how lucky you are to have this treat!  I'm usually not an enchilada fan, but you have to try one here.  Some of the reviews comment on decor.  While it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles, I would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china.  And that salsa, I really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles, but then I'd have to check it in my bag to go back home!"}
{"text":"This place would be getting one star if it wasn't for the kind gentleman with red hair who took my order and carried my food out to the car for me. The chips here are also awesome! Besides for that there is too much to be desired and they didn't put the entire order together which made me have to drive back after returning home and everyone's food was cold. They also didn't put tomatoes on anything-not in the tacos or on the tostadas. It didn't make any sense to me. The guacamole lacked flavor and the salsa was so spicy!! My brother-in-law said that there wasn't bad Mexican food here and I would disagree. The enchiladas tasted like the box seasoning I use at home and the asada meat was dry. The wait for the food was over 30 min...for take out! All in all, with the plethora of other Mexican restaurants in the area this will not be one I am returning to."}
{"text":"Best green chile beef burro with relleno sauce that can be found anywhere!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I got to try this last Friday about 8:30pm (didn't realize they close at 9pm).  The food was above average, and the prices are low, but the atmosphere is woefully out of date and dilapidated.   I appreciate the longevity and family-run aspects, but come on guys it's time for a remodel (at least some fresh paint and better lighting). A few booths would be a huge upgrade from the wobbly tables, and I'm also not a huge fan of paper plates...  This would be a better choice for a quick lunch on the cheap, or take out."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great, the people are nice and it isn't terribly expensive. It's quick since you go to the window, order, then pick your food up and pick a table.  You don't have to bus your own table which is weird, but I usually do anyway.  Not sure if they like it, but I always seem to be there when they're picking up the trays and such, so I don't want to be that guy that leaves a mess in a perfectly clean area.  It's pretty much standard fare Sonoran Mexican food.  It's all good.  At first, I didn't like paying for chips, but you realize that it's not a sit down place like La Pinata or Mi Patio, so it comes with the territory.  Besides, the chips are great.  It's been a Lent standby since I don't like fish, I'll just get a bean and cheese burrito, some chips and a drink.  occasionally, I'll get a bean tostada, but it depends on how hungry I am.    Their cheese crisps aren't my favorite, but when you think about the fact that \"cheese crisp\" contains \"crisp,\" I can't fault them on that.  So, as always, I'll keep going there.  I'd like to get in there for breakfast sometime and give that a try.  I haven't thought of trying America's Taco Shop yet.  Some people complain about the ambiance, but I love it.  I don't need a bunch of loud people or TVs, though I've heard discussions where they were thinking about a TV since they thought they could pull in more of a sporting crowd, but the owners are pretty steadfast on it, and I'm fine with it.  There are plenty of places to go that HAVE TVs, so why not leave a few that don't.  You're there to eat."}
{"text":"Love the cheese crisp that's always a must to start. I do love how you can order chico plates now since the regular order is usually too much food. Had the beef burrito Chico plate, enchilada Chico plate and of course cheese crisp. Prices are reasonable and they have beer!"}
{"text":"Normally we have no issues with our orders at this place. This trip I ordered take out. The cashier didn't know much about the menu, when asked if simple ingredients were present in dish. I ordered two taco salads, one without olives. When I got home I had one taco salad no lettuce and one regular salad with a few bits of chicken. Agh. I called and they are making it right on my next visit. I appreciate great customer service."}
{"text":"Yummy, inexpensive classic Mexican food. Unfortunately, they are totally unreliable and inconsistent. I have ordered the bean/rice/green chile strips burrito FIVE different times and without fail it is wrong each and every time. Did I order green chile? No! I ordered green chile strips. Did I ask for rice and not get any? Yes! Why didn't I learn my lesson after my second visit? Glutton for punishment. And I'm a mediocre cook.   Want the best inexpensive, classic, consistent Mexi-food? Try Carolina's!"}
{"text":"When ever our family gets together for meals this is definitely our go to place, in fact its where we always go.  I have never ever been disappointed by los.  It is a comfortable sit down place where you can socialize and not feel rushed.  It is typically pretty quite and is a good all around place to eat.  The service has always been pretty good, portions are a nice size and I believe it is worth every penny.  If you are looking for some great Mexican food I would totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So. Good!!! The negative reviews are shocking. Literally everything we had was delicious. From the chips and salsa, to the complimentary cheese crisp because it was our firs visit, to the combo that had a little bit of everything...every bite was perfect. Great service to boot. We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, friendly staff...what more could you want? I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had a hankering for some good Mexican food, and, after consulting Yelp, we ended up at Los Compadres. This place was not really what I was imagining when entering a Mexican restaurant. This place is very casual, walk up to the counter to order, seat yourself kind of place. I felt like the prices were a little higher than what I would expect for a place like this, but they weren't ridiculous. I ordered a machaca enchilada and a cheese crisp. I was delivered a cheese enchilada and cheese crisp. I told the people up front and they brought me the one I ordered. The cheese enchilada was actually better than the machaca, which was kind of tough and nothing special. The cheese crisp was a bit on the small size (not your typical pizza pan affair) and was overly crisp... almost burnt. It was alright, but nothing special. My friend didn't love her food either. It wasn't bad, but I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Love coming to Los. I've been coming here forever. I love when I bring a new friend and they always are skeptical about eating there (based on location and how nerve racking the neighborhood is). Once we are finished I know they are all converts. Los Compadres is a gem and one of the only authentic mexican restaurants in Phoenix. It's family owned and I love that. I would give an arm and a leg to keep this place open. If you haven't tried it yet get your butt in there and shame on you."}
{"text":"Hang on...gotta wipe the cheese off my chin.  Oh, crap, the enchilada sauce is on my keyboard. Cheese crisp with Guacamole.  Two cheese enchiladas, one for tomorrow. There's a mess.  Everywhere.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhyessssssssssss!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Mexican food and fast service."}
{"text":"This place is all about Mexican comfort food. It reminds me of the places my parents used to go to when I was a kid. (I don't think the prices have changed since the 80s, either.) One really heartwarming thing: I sat down next to an older guy who shared his Wall Street Journal. He said that in the dark light he could only read the headlines."}
{"text":"I got a guy that was as welcoming as a mortician  I remember his name but not going to embarrass him further.  He knows who he is.  The food was good but small amount.  AAAAAND, while I watched him give chips and salsa to 3 other customers, I was not one of them!!!.  I wrote him a \"thank you\" note on the receipt and wanted to be sure he enjoyed his tip that was electronically asked for BEFORE service.......and for counter service, no less.  I agree with Gabriel G. ....dark, dingy.  Nope I will never be back."}
{"text":"Had it not been for Yelp, I may have gone my whole life without eating here.  I have to believe that because I've driven by this place SO many times and went \"Oh, Mexican food place\" and within a few miles I'd forgotten all about it.  Silly me.  So this place totally started out as a house.  Lots of little rooms and funky spaces.  There are actually two different entrances - neither one as the official \"main\" entrance.  And conveniently there are two different counters at which you can order on the busy night we were there, I didn't see more than 2 people in line at any one time.  Order food at the window.  They call your name and you go grab your food.  Chips and salsa are $.50 and while they aren't particularly exceptional, it's worth grabbing especially if there are several of you.    I got a combo to try some traditional standards.  Prices are cheap which is great.  My combo (6.95), drink (1.75) and Chips(0.50) and salsa came out to just 9.95 after tax.  The taco was really good, a bit greasy, but not bad at all.   The enchilada was really amazing.  The sauce wasn't your average sauce - it had a nice kick.  The burrito was a joke.  I hardly ate any after the other two, but I had to at least try it after hearing such good things.  Very yummy - though I really want to try the bean burrito after all the great things said in prior reviews.    But that - will be next time.  And my friend and I have already talked about our next trip here.  Quick, inexpensive and good quality food.    Special note - When headed there don't forget that this is on 7th ave so you can't use the turn lane during rush hours.  Make sure you're headed the right way to make sure that isn't an issue!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 40 years. Today will be my last visit. The last two times we have gone the food has been sub par, plus they raised the prices. $4.25 for a bean burrito. Get real.   The tortilla now taste store bought, as do the beans. The cheese crisp was chewy and frankly missing the cheese. The only thing worth eating was the salsa.   Whoever is running the restaurant now has taken a city icon and destroyed or."}
{"text":"Awesome green Chile, great Mexican food staples refried beans, tacos, enchiladas salsa chips.  Been coming here around 30+ years."}
{"text":"The beer is nice and cold!!! That's the only good thing I can say. The rice was cold and without flavor. The tortilla of my enchilada was so tough I had to saw through it with my knife. Well at least the plastic utensils is of good quality.  I will not return and strongly suggest any reader of the negative reviews to heed the warnings. I didn't and now I'm out 10 bucks and still hungry as I couldn't bring myself to finish even half of the meal."}
