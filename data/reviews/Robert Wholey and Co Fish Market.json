{"text":"For a guy from California, Wholey's is like a trip to europe.  The Fish sandwiches are great -- we had the cod - deep fried -- WOW!! 

We spent an hour in the store - packed with people.  One of our reunion   friends (natives of Pittsburgh)  told us the Strip District was a must see!!  They were right!  Lots of history there and Wholey's made the day."}
{"text":"The market side gets 4 stars, the restaurant 2.

When you walk in the door there is a sign that says Rule #1: the customer is always right. Rule #2: if the customer is wrong, see rule #1. They could use some reminding.

After ordering a couple sandwiches, which were handed over quickly, walked up to pay. There was one older lady there trying to pay, and the cashier was bickering with her. She had put her soup in the wrong container, it seems, and the cashier was yelling at her about it. She got the right container and poured the lady's soup in there, which didn't work very well and soup went everywhere. So she started cleaning soup, all the while berating the customer. (To be fair, by the time I walked up they were both very cranky, and I know its hard to be nice to someone when they are fussing at you - but that's the woman's job.) 

By the time she finished cleaning the counter, the woman's purchases, and finally got around to ringing her up, the line had backed up quite a lot. It took nearly 10 minutes. Then I went up and the girl started snapping at me too, and went on complaining about the last customer, which I found to be really rude. Finally I was able to pay and grab a seat.

The fish sandwich was good, as advertised. The fries were horrendous. Already cold when served, they were a mass of congealed grease by the time we sat. I ate one and gave up on them. The coleslaw was nice though. The fries were an odd problem to me - in a place with that many fryers, they should always be fresh.

The market I liked a lot, and I'll be back there, probably a lot. They sell chicken feet, which makes broth that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Very simple,  this place smelled so bad I could not even enter.   Some would say, that's what fish smells like.   No, that's what rotten fish smells like.   You should never smell fish in any establishment that sells seafood.   If you do,  there's a problem.   I've been working in retail food service most of my life,  if any seafood department in any of my stores smelled like this,  those managers would need to find employment elsewhere.   Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and I stopped into Wholey's for lunch to try their cod fish sandwich and calamari. The cod fish sandwich was huge and not to mention tasty. It was still crispy and wasn't overwhelmingly greasy and soggy like some other sandwiches I've had where all you taste is the grease. It could have used a little seasoning in the batter, but with some of their tartar sauce and a little hot sauce it was perfect. As for the calamari... WOW!!!! The best I have had yet!! I liked it even more than Detroit Parthenon's calamari. Which is now my second favorite. It's going to be hard to find calamari that tops Wholey's and their price. For $3, you get a really healthy portion... about 1/3 of a paper bag. There is no need to douse them in cocktail sauce or lemon juice at all. They are perfect plain because they have already added some extraordinary seasoning to it. I also had one of their moon pies and a brownie. Both were scrumptious to say the least. The crab cakes were packed with chunks of crab and were excellent.  The upstairs dining area where we sat was a little hard to find and looked like a typical diner... it was quaint but nothing special. 
I wasn't able to try their fresh fish obviously because I couldn't take it home with me on my 4 1/2 hour trek back to the D. But I am planning on trying out their mail order service. Everything looked really fresh, they even have a variety of live fish in huge tanks, I mean you can't get any fresher than that. I just wish Detroit had some sort of fish market of this caliber. I would be there all the time!!"}
{"text":"Have to come here. We love visiting and getting seafood. Friendly staff and always have what you need. Very cool environment."}
{"text":"By far the fish sandwich in Pittsburgh. Cod on soft. Do it."}
{"text":"All sorts of meat & seafoods are sold here. tomatos, potatoes, green peppers, onions here are cheaper and w/ higher quality than that in Lotus, because the Americans love them too much..."}
{"text":"First off - I am a Philadelphian but whenever I visit the Steel City, Wholey's is a must.  My favorite is the fried fish sandwich and the lobster mac and cheese.  Recently I tried the clam strips, oh they were so fantastic.  My husband, a native Burgher, is all about the Shrimp Po Boy.  
Second - the bread, oh that bread is wonderful, it adds so much character to an already awesome sandwich with super fresh fish.
Lastly - portion size, I am full when I leave. they give huge pieces of fish."}
{"text":"For Christmas my husband and I decided to make halibut.  Which was the reason why we went to Wholey.  The halibut was good but it cost more than I'd hope.  But what the heck, it's Christmas. 

The reason I'm giving 4* is because of their spice section.  Either I haven't been out much to buy spices or their spices are super cheap.  Most of them are 4 for $5!  That's crazy cheap ($1.25 each).  I'm used to paying $3-$5 for a little jar of spices.  These aren't the 1\" diameter by 1.5\" tall jars.  They're more like 1.5\" diameter by 4\" tall bottles.  We bought a lot of spices.  For sure, before I move out of Pgh, I'm going to stock up on spices from Wholey."}
{"text":"We have been searching high and low for a source of Lake Michigan whitefish chubs -- these small smoked fish are far superior in flavor and texture to full-size whitefish.  The Missus is from Wisconsin, and I am from New York, and the supply of these fish has been practically nil for months.  Just can't get anything like this in Northern California (although it's hard to beat our local salmon and dungeness crab), and the Wisconsin suppliers have been out.  Then we found www.wholey.com online and there they were!

We ordered the 3 pound package at a very fair price, and we are accustomed to paying air freight for specialty foods.  We spoke directly to Dan Wholey, who was totally helpful, and we received the most awesome personal service -- and our fish arrived the following day.

It was smoky with firm flesh -- and not mushy.  On a buttered bagel -- superb!

Saw some other fish that we will consider in the future: crawfish tails, Atlantic lobster.

We've never been to Pittsburgh, but if we're ever in the neighborhood,  know where we're going for lunch!"}
{"text":"By far the most unique stop for any visit to Pittsburgh. You have to get a Whaler (1/2 pound of whiting or cod fried and heaping over the bread of your choice. The clams are clammering and the fish are still in water. This place is fresh and a sight. If you eat upstairs you are sure to run into one of the owners. The sons pour their love into the place."}
{"text":"First off - to the guy who gave one star because of the car park guy - you're an idiot! Parking is tough down there and if you aren't in wholey's move your car, so their customers can park. I wish I could Yelp punch you! 

Now on to wholey's - I have been coming here for at least 20 years and have never had anything less than excellent. The cod sandwich, crab cakes, shrimp po boy, and Louisiana gumbo are my favorite.

The bathrooms do get a little gnarly on weekends, but what fish market has spectacular bathrooms?"}
{"text":"Get a bucket of mussels and a bucket of beer and chill out in this cavern of a restaurant.  With it's close proximity to the rest of the fish markets in the Strip District, Wholey's seafood is fresh, simple, and delicous.  If you want a Pittsburgh history lesson, check out the walls."}
{"text":"Best seafood market this side of the Mississippi. Great stop to just see all the fish, shrimp., crabs, lobsters, and other creatures of the sea. Fantastic live tanks are giant aquarims of fish. They also cook some of their fresh catch, cafeteria style with informal dining upstairs. The cod was delicious and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Informal modest surroundings within an active fish market.  Cafeteria style with limited offering of fish and seafood.  No waiter/waitress service. 
Cafeteria line moves quickly with the advantage of getting your food almost immediately upon entering.  Bread is fresh and of high quality, so rolls are soft and tasty.  Fish is as fresh as fresh can be including oysters.  It is the best seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh (and, in my opinion, may be one of the best seafood eateries in the US). Free refills on soft drinks. So, don't go to fancy restaurants and order seafood; instead, wear jeans and sneakers, and drop into Robert Wholey."}
{"text":"I love Andy their sushi chef. I always get the spider roll and it's always awesome. It's as simple as that. You should try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this store and its owners, but I can never go back there again.

     I made the mistake of ordering  a live fish, observing that one of the practitioners chopped off the head, then proceeded to filet the fish. I felt that was humane enough and expected that the fellow handling mine would do the same. It seemed unnecessary to ask, \"is the fish already out of it's misery before you process it\". 
    So I ordered one, expecting what I had seen to transpire again.
    However, a different guy, frustratingly slower, skinned the poor fish, cut his fins, changing knives while the head was still unsevered from the spine, its poor heart beating in its chest while being flayed. its tail flapping, and I asked if it was killed, but he didn't answer.   \"Did you see it move\"? he asked with a smile i didn't like, still cutting. 
He said after he was done, that they had just stunned the fish before cutting it open. 

    I am horrified. I never would have ordered it if I had known the method this man would choose to use. I do not understand why they couldn't have made sure it was out of its misery before all that the poor creature went through. Who wants to consume something that has been unnecessarily tortured this way?
  In my distress,  I asked for the owner, who I usually see there, but neither of them were there. The manager with whom I spoke was unsympathetic and unhelpful. 
    It really ruined my day and disrupted my harmony. I just wanted to know that my food was food before being treated like food.I am horrified with the poor creature's demise, and disgusted with the people who I dealt with at Wholley's in the owners absence."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! Great seafood. For 6 bucks you get a 2 large pieces of cod on your sandwich. Great condiments. Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"My daughter had been here before so we decided to make 90 mile trip to The Strip District to do a little shopping for eclectic foods and spices.  If you enjoy a fish sandwich you MUST try the cod sandwich!  The best I have ever eaten and was a large portion.  I also enjoyed the coleslaw and fries.  Very good meal and very reasonable in price.  Plus, it's fun to shop for all things \"fish\" while you're there!"}
{"text":"Affordably priced. Got the lobster bisque and the Alaskan salmon with sweet soy. Excellent food and tremendous service! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and i got the fish sandwich and could barely finish it and my home cut fries.  The fish market side has some great looking fish, crabs, clams, etc.  I'm looking forward to future visits."}
{"text":"I have to give a shout out to the oyster man on the sidewalk.  Wonderful oysters (seriously), friendly service, conveniently located (I don't have to shove through people in the market), and cheap.  At $1 a piece, or like 3 for $5, or 6 for $10-something like that-you really can't go wrong.  I've had two different shuckers that were both extremely friendly and conversational.  They shuck the oyster right there while you wait.  They have lemon, horse radish, and hot sauce on the whim, right there at the little stand! 

If you happen to be passing by, stop and say hello and grab a fresh cold oyster!  I was trying to make it every Friday for a drive by oyster snack during nice weather.  I'm not sure if they're open during the winter, but be sure to check!  I brought an out of town oyster guru friend and he thought they were amazing.  Winner!

As for the store, they have a great selection of seafood.  Being from Houston, I'm used to the crawfish, catfish, fried shrimp kind, but much prefer the selection here.  It's a little pricey, but nothing outrageous.  I love the hustle and bustle of a seafood market and this place doesn't disappoint!  A slice of San Francisco in the Burgh.

They also have other items besides just seafood.  And sidewalk oysters!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that people have raved about the fish sandwiches. I picked up sandwiches for the second time (the last having been two years ago)and nothing has changed. They are greasy and unappetizing. The french fries were also greasy and overcooked. They must believe that grease is the second ingredient next to the fish. I will say the staff is very pleasant and nice. I wish I could say the same about the cooked food. I will not be returning for a fish sandwich but I will continue to purchase the fresh fish, etc."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Even being from the East Coast, I would recommend the hot seafood for an excellent lunch at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wholey's is my go to place in Pittsburgh for meat, and not just fish.  They have an amazing selection of fresh seafood at very reasonable prices.  This week fresh salmon fillets were $5.99 a pound and swordfish steaks were $7.99 a pound.  The quality is super high and the results delicious! I have bought the bulk filet mignon a few times at 9.99-11.99 a pound and grilled it whole, which turns out to be an easy and awesome meal for a group.  They also have a nice selection of prepared foods and produce, all at great prices, including Andy's sushi right up front as well as lobster rolls outside and freshly shucked oysters.  This is a near weekly stop for me even though it's a bit of a drive.  If you live near Pittsburgh please do yourself a favour and give Wholey's a try."}
{"text":"The funny thing is Wholey's is not so much I  place I go for fish, but for other harder to find cuts of pork and beef. It's a convenient stop for me when I need pork hocks and beef tongue. The prices are quite competitive. 

I'm not sure what's up with the sushi guy in the front. He's always giving me the evil eye."}
{"text":"Just bought their lobster rolls pre packed.  Pretty good for a nice price.  The quality seafood is so much cheaper than giant eagle.  Worth the drive"}
{"text":"Fantastic prices on all items! Fish is extremely fresh and relatively inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Portions are huge.  Portions are fresh.  It is tasty.  Did I mention that I love his place?  Pierogies were good, onion rings were fresh and crisp.  Now that I have eaten the menu there multiple times, I'd love it to add the lobster roll.  I'm not begging, but pleeez, pleeez!"}
{"text":"Disappointing had soft shell crab sandwich lobster mac and lobster crab soup. None of which were very good i was very excited to eat here love seafood. Facility stinks and is not very clean. The hot food cooking area was a complete disaster will not be going back"}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop by when i'm in the strip.  

The fresh fish are laid out on ice or swimming around in huge pools of water.  Once a huge cat fish jumped OUT at me and flailed its body on the ground, causing me to scream like a small child and everyone in this huge warehouse to turn and look at me.

Great place for pistachios, imported goodies or just to check out on a busy weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"I think this is a really awesome \"grocery\" store. It has PLENTY of seafood, and the prices are not outrageous, and rather reasonable - which I know some places like to charge up the wazoo for seafood. Example: TWO lobster tails of 8-10 oz were just shy of $20. Their lobster mac & cheese is scrumptious, though I do wish it had a bit more lobster. The lobster and crab bisque was also pretty good, though I do wish it had more chunks in it. As for not buying it at a restaurant though, it's the best store bought bisque I have found.
There's weekly sales.
On top of the yummy seafood on one side, there's a \"middle\" section with pork, beef and chicken.. where the prices are also reasonable. Example: two filet mignons of decent size were $18. That's $10-20 cheaper than when you buy a filet meal at a restaurant, and you only get one for that meal.
The last part you hit is similar to a normal grocery store - small olive bar, a few frozen meals (mostly seafood related, but others as well), small pasta and bread section, cheese and meat and eggs, and a decent amount of produce which is also fairly priced!
There's a parking lot dedicated to shoppers at Wholey's. 
Excellent location, and a fun crowd on the weekends. 
I need to try their sushi or meals to go next time."}
{"text":"I love that whaler sandwich ;  a huge handful of fried whiting on a bun.  my wife loved buying the fresh seafood of her choice as i enjoyed my whaler and lemonade.  what a great selection of fresh and frozen seafood, and a good selection of meat also.  my daughter gave the lobster mac/cheese a thumbs up.  everything on the hot foods line looked delicious.    5 star sandwich      4 star setting     you need to be lucky to find  parking, and a basic self serve dining room is upstairs. 5 star seafood service   4 star hot food service.    still my top choice in pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last 4 years and have neer had a bad experience. The staff our very helpful and courteous and usually can get you what you are looking for. The variety of quality fresh seafoods and meats is by far the bes tin Pittsburgh. One thing that I can truely appreciate is the one time I had less than perfect product, Wholey's stood behind that porduct and promptly exchanged the item. That act of customer service has made me a customer for life. I'm also always on the look out for lobster sales, it is mind boggling to see prices on live lobster that are less than what they are in Maine. If you nede some great seafood this is the place."}
{"text":"We ordered some food to eat. We also did a little shopping. For our meal, we got a pound of fried cod, a crab cake sandwich and fresh cooked potato chips. The fish and chips were very good. The fish is flaky and the batter is wonderful. The crab cakes were less than desired, mostly filler. But they were still pretty good. The chips are awesome, though. Thick cut and sprinkled with Old Bay. The whole meal was like $22. Not bad.

For shopping, we got a few odds and ends. They have tons of fresh fish and dozens of different frozen selections. Its all pretty pricey but, for Pittsburgh, its the place to get fish if that's what you're into."}
{"text":"I come here often for their huge seafood and meat selections, mainly because they are fresh. 

I passed by their fried food a lot and always think they're unhealthy and greasy. Today, I decided to try the fried fish out as I was really hungry. To my surprise, the whiting fish was excellent, the tartar is not the best I've had, but it's very good. I also tried their lemonade, it's also very good. It's not overly sweet or sour, just perfect. 

Will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Really nice sandwiches and sides - I was impressed and will go back this weekend - the fried cod sandwich was huge - the store has great fresh fish selection and I bought some baby back ribs that were unbelievable cooked with one of the Wholey's special sauces."}
{"text":"With the fish sandwiches here I'd have no problem eating fish on fridays.  In fact the fish sandwiches here are that good that I could eat them every day.

Sometimes the best meals seem the simplest.  A fried fish fillet on a bun seems like it would be easy, but Wholey's takes it to another level."}
{"text":"We walk twenty minutes every Friday to get lunch at Wholey's. Today they had blackened swordfish on special, but they didn't have any ready. That would be fine if the guy taking our order had spoken up and told me it would be a wait. He didnt so instead I stood in line from 12:30 until 12:50 but they had my fries (which was the skimpiest order of fries I have ever received) sitting on top of the food window for fifteen minutes. I threw those in the trash because all ten of those fries were room temperature. 

Last week they double charged me for shrimp. There are places closer to work that have good food."}
{"text":"First off, do not go to the address listed for these reviews.  I am guessing that folks just started posting here, and never stopped.  The correct location is actually at the 1700 block.  This place , the 1500 block, is where the wholesale market for restaurants and grocery stores is.  Pretty obvious, unless you are not from the area, in which case you will be wondering \"Where the $%$# is Wholey's ?\" if you go to 1501 Penn Ave.

Bought the jumbo crab legs here yesterday.  At 25 bucks a pound for the jumbos, definitely not cheap, but celebrating a new job and at the same time starting a two week Cisco class.

Anyways...  I love crab.  I remember first buying the snow crab in 1985, when you could buy large snow crab legs that rivalled the size of todays king crab legs for $2.79 a pound.  Kind of like you used to be able to get skirt steak for a buck a pound before people discovered how delicious skirt steak is.

The regular king crab was $18.00 per lb.  The jumbo are $25.00 per lb.  I said what the heck, and got three pounds of the jumbos.  Which came out to six legs.  

First big plus, they are very \"clean\".  Don't have big chunks of ice crusted on them, which forces you to pay $25.00 a pound for water.

Second, at that price, I have zero problem having the person at the counter dig down in the display to get exactly what I want.  And while other folks may have had bad experiences, I have never had a surly counter person, they never have any problem getting what I want.  But like I said, for the price these things cost, they better not have a problem with digging out the ones I want.

And last, they were very good looking.  No \"odd' coloration or look.  

When I got these things home, I only steamed two of them.  Which was a very healthy sized meal.  And they were the sweetest and best tasting I had ever had.  Just ate them with butter.

Today, I am just going to thaw and heat one of them, then chop up the meat and have it over iceberg lettuce with FRESH MADE Ranch dressing.  I love getting Hidden valley Ranch, mixing it with just a pint of sour cream, and dressing iceberg and king crab meat with it.  One of my favorite, and most likelt easiest, meals.

And!!!  Wholey's is a full serve grocery store.  They have a full meat department, veggies, not as big as a Giant Eagle or a Wal-Mart, but definitely better than either place.  

So DON'T think of Wholey's as just a place for seafood.  You can get your whole party stocked from here.

Now, the bad things.  They only have five (5!?!?!) cash registers.  Also, they sell sushi, but it is so popular, unless you want to stand there for half an hour, don't get the sushi unless you happen to walk in, and no one is standing in line.  In which case, get the sushi.  It is pretty good, suprsingly so."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to visit on our brief trip through Pittsburgh. We enjoyed walking around the fish market, checking out what was fresh, as well as seeing the grocery store side.

We ate lunch from the hot bar area, which was delicious but not the healthiest thing. I got a po'boy with shrimp, coleslaw and chips on the side. We also tried the lobster mac and cheese. The portions are huge and I don't think I was hungry for dinner until MUCH later that night.

The seating area is up some stairs and surprisingly big. There are signs everywhere indicating that they hope you have a pleasant experience and to let someone know if things aren't tidy. An employee was putting fresh sheets of brown paper on the tables and wiping everything up. There were also several different condiment and flatware stations. 

I love that we stopped by this long-standing Pittsburgh gem. I just probably picked up a piece of fruit of something from the grocery section to go with my meal! ;)"}
{"text":"Such a cool little market.  This is a must do if you are in the area while visiting Pittsburgh.  You don't need to allocate a lot of time for this stop, maybe 15 minutes.  Just enough time to walk through the store and check it out.  It's part of the culture and it's the kind of place we would be regulars at if we lived in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"It pains me to write a two-star review of this large fish market in the Strip District. When you walk in, there's just so much variety from different kinds of fish, shellfish, and other such fishy delights to a good selection of frozen goods, spices, and ready-to-eat crab cakes. However, despite the criminally low prices on the live Maine lobsters (the best deal in the entire store), I was put off by the cloudy live fish tanks and the fact that there was a lot of seafood on display that was frozen (being so close to Maryland, there's no real need for frozen crab). Floors are slippery so keep an eye out, and remember-- a good fishmonger WILL let you touch the product to test for freshness and texture; they should also be able to tell you where the fish comes from and whether it was wild, farmed, or line caught. So get that grocery list ready and make sure to ask questions. Seafood is tasty-- it doesn't need to be the next mystery meat."}
{"text":"This place is one of the coolest places ever.  Where i come from all we have is Walmart Super centers and other chain grocery stores.  This place feels like it is.  A grocery \fish market\ Meat packing place.  The seafood selection is great here as well as the chicken beef and pork.  The best reason to go here while on your journey on the strip is for a Whaler sandwich.  People you do not need fries with this fresh mammoth fish sandwich.  They bread it in front of you.  You gotta make you way to this place while your in town and in the strip district."}
{"text":"I stop every time I'm in Pittsburgh for a fish sandwich.   My favorite of all fish places. It never disappoints!  The lobster mac and cheese is to die for as well.  I would give the place 5 stars but the logistics of the food line is a bit wacky.  There's always a bottleneck at the end while waiting for your food and paying at the cashier.  There's no room for waiting and you have to try and weed your way through people to get to the drink fountain.   I really wish they would configure this better."}
{"text":"A trip to Pittsburgh without hitting WHOLEY's is like not hitting Primanti's either...If you LOVE SEAFOOD, if you LOVE SUSHI....you have to try WHOLEY's...atmosphere is SEAFOOD MARKET which in my opinion ADDS to the atmosphere, plus you know the food you are eating is as fresh as it can possibly be for Pittsburgh....Andy, the Sushi Chef is unbelievable and just an outstanding guy. Will give you a sample of some of the freshest Tuna while you wait for him to make your rolls right in front of you....The Clam Chowder, the Fish Sandwiches, Smelts, etc., all outstanding and just a fun place while in the STRIP! GO!"}
{"text":"This post is mainly about the hot food served here, not their actual raw seafood because I never bought anything raw, but it sure smells like fish right as soon as you walk in. 

The hot food is to the left of the entrance as soon as you walk in, behind the sushi counter. Hot food menu includes fish sandwiches (ranging from $4.50-$7.99 by size/weight), crab cakes, soft shell crabs, and various appetizers/sides. 

I ordered the cod sandwich ($6.25) with a side of calamari ($3.99). The fish sandwich came loaded with crispy white fish meat between soft buns. Smother on some tartar sauce for the touch of perfection! I love the proportion of fish to bun. The calamari was crispy with a slight hint of salt and crunch. The breading was subtle and wasn't overpowering the taste of the squid like other calamari elsewhere. Definitely one of my favorite calamari recipes!

Overall, I highly recommend stopping by Wholey's to try their hot food selections if you're a seafood fan looking for a quick and cheap lunch or snack!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is fabulous!!
Wholey is one of those must go to markets in Pittsburgh hints why there are always so many people there.
Last time I was here I ordered a beer battered piece of cod. Oh baby!!! It was very good for just a piece of fish! I have also ordered the Lobster rolls before which are also very fabulous! 
Wholey also has a lot of different kinds of seafood for you to purchase and cook at home as well.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great sea food prices. Can't be beat in the area! The small hint good section they have is great! The lobster Mac and lobster roll are fantastic. Also the sushi place is good to. The guy who runs it always has something funny to say.  All and all in all I rather shop there then giant eagle."}
{"text":"The boy and I were walking along the strip when he suddenly stopped and said, \"Something smells really really good,\" and pulled me along until we came to the sidewalk grill at Wholey's.  So this review is only for the streetside grill, since we didn't get any further than that!  We both ordered the salmon lunch, and for $6, were completely satisfied.

The next time we visit, I'm making sure we actually get into the store though."}
{"text":"if you tell me on a monday that we're going to pittsburgh on saturday, i WILL spend the entire week daydreaming about wholey's.

every time i go to pittsburgh, i need my dose of wholey-guacamole cod fish sandwiches:: gigantic, luscious fillets of deep-fried (twice..i try not to look) cod on soft buns (but you can also get it on mancini). for a mere $5.75, you'll be full and in a happy place.

the dining area is quite clean and spacious, and all the sauces are available up there, so no need to awkwardly carry condiments up a flight of stairs. go for the house-made tartar sauce. it's the perfect consistency and enhances your love affair with the cod.

after your meal, buy fresh shrimp, crab legs, (fish) steaks, and just about any type of old bay and any type of sauce your seafood-lovin' heart could desire. the staff is generally super friendly and helpful.

there's a little sushi stand here, too, and i've been meaning to hit it up, but i still haven't gotten around to it. all the fish behind the glass is bursting with healthy color and always makes my eyes linger a little longer than they probably should. the sushi master is so jolly and easy to talk to, and even offers free samples to a select few.

finally, hooray for free parking across the street, exclusively for wholey patrons!"}
{"text":"Great choices for fresh seafood - especially considering how far Pittsburgh is from the shore!  They also have a good Italian cheese shop too.  A Pittsburgh institution."}
{"text":"Where can you go for the freshest fish, a good selection of meats and chicken, complete your grocery shopping and then have a good meal? Wholey's of course! 

They have fresh chicken wings here packed on ice. You can get them by the pound versus the prepackaged freezer bags. They have breakfast meats and good cuts of artery clogging bacon. We know it's not healthy but darn, everything in moderation! The produce section contains everything from collard greens to delicious sweet crispy apples and local cider. Towards the register, you'll find fudge and popcorn. Yummers! Oh, and I forgot the deli. This isn't your average deli....what deli do you know of that has lobster rolls and bisque in their case?

Look, I've been coming here for years. It's been a family event at times as well as a touristy spot to show off to some out of towner guest. I like this place because it's given me the opportunity to buy and cook different types of seafood. Some of the fish can't be found in the local grocery stores either. If you've ever had a chance to speak with Mr. Wholey, you may already know he's very passionate about his shrimp and prides himself on only choosing the best to sell at his store. He was pretty cool and down to earth when I met him a little over a year ago. 

They have an area upstairs where you can sit and dine. The restrooms are located downstairs in the back of the main entrance. 

So, a fish place smells fishy. The fishy smell is the first thing you notice when you hit the door but it's not unbearable by any means. After you're in there for about a minute, you don't even notice it anymore. 

One of my favorite places to stop in the strip!"}
{"text":"Amazing cod fish sandwiches! Cannot be beat. Upstairs dining room is clean and well maintained. We've been coming here for decades and the quality has never changed. Truly a unique and wonderful Pittsburgh experience. 

Their fresh fish and frozen shrimp and lobster products are very good too."}
{"text":"A great store . The freshest seafood in the city . The part I like best is the hot foods prepared outside on a grill right in front of you . Salmon , halibut , steAk kabobs etc. Luke grills everything to perfection 7 days a week ."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Seafood is the freshest and the staff is so friendly.  Always a viable to help.  When ever I am in Pittsburgh I head to Wholey for the Saturday sidewalk eats which is great there lobster slider, shrimp and oysters are so fresh and yummy.  Great prices,  can't say that enough!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous cod sandwich and amazing seafood shopping. This is the 1lb cod sandwich on whole wheat. The staff is really helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in love with this place. Fresh fish at good prices. Then...there's also fresh crab cakes to eat! They are so good. I think of Wholey's every time I think of Pittsburgh now. 

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"(kitchen review only) This place is awesome! The food is delicious, plentiful, and insanely cheap. I enjoyed everything, but the calamari and hush puppies were especially good. The cod was beer-battered, tender, and flaky. The crab cakes had large chunks of crab. I also tried the white chocolate pecan fudge which was amazing. I was disappointed to see that most of their seafood is frozen, but we're in Pittsburgh here. Can't wait to try the mac and cheese!

Their grilled lunches are half off ($3) after thr lunch rush hour!"}
{"text":"Went down to Wholeys for their Annual Oysterfest weekend.  The Strip was busy as hell but after circling a few times we finally managed to find a parking spot.  Got into Wholeys and immediately started searching for the 'oyster bar'.  Found it in the far back and started to pick out our dinner for the evening.  They had a whole bunch of different varieties (see pics) and we took several of each- well maybe more than several as they were ONLY 98 cents each!  The sweetest ones were the greenish colored shells (again-see pics).  We also grabbed 3 pounds of crayfish, a pound of the huge shrimp and some beautiful looking Delmonico steaks.  We were planning a huge dinner.  
I LOVE coming here for all the different sights, smells and variety you can find.  Wholeys is a Pittsburgh GEM and no visit to Pittsburgh would be complete without a trip here..."}
{"text":"Wholey Fish Market, Batman!  Actually, there's a whole(y) lot more than just fish here, but seafood is clearly their area of expertise.

I knew I liked Wholey's before husband and I even entered the building.  As we walked up, a cart on the sidewalk beckoned with glistening oysters on the half-shell, expertly and efficiently shucked by one worker, comically hawked by another wearing a huge chef's hat and heckling passersby via a lobster bullhorn.  (You had to be there.)  At $1 a pop  -- or $5 for a half dozen -- husband and I didn't waste a moment and were soon slurping a fat, juicy, delicious Chesapeake Bay oyster on the bustling sidewalk.  A great intro to Wholey's.

Inside we were dazzled by the endless array of beautiful fresh and frozen seafood, everything from tuna steaks to Jonah crab.  Near the entrance Wholey's sushi chef was hard at work.  At the back we watched lobsters and live fish swimming in huge tanks.  Extending farther down the block was Wholey's meat section, featuring baby back ribs, whole chickens, pork chops.  Beyond that, even, we discovered the produce section.  Peppered throughout the market were gourmet chips, dried fruits and veggies for snacking, seafood condiments.....you can spend a vast amount of time wandering, eyes agog.  And we did.

After wandering husband and I knew we needed to sample some of the hot food.  We weren't ravenously hungry, tho, so we chose the random pairing of a small crab and lobster mac 'n' cheese and a side of hush puppies (husband is obsessed), and made our way upstairs to the dining room.  This banquet-hall like space was pretty ugly and old-school, but an experience nonetheless.  Hush puppies (a *generous* serving) were bite-size nuggets with crunchy, crispy exteriors and soft, tender middles.  Dipping them in Wholey's homemade tartar and cocktail sauces enhanced them further.  The mac 'n' cheese was enjoyable, too, with nice big chunks of wild-caught lobster and crab meat.  

I'm already looking forward to a return trip to Pittsburgh: I've got Wholey's fish sammie in my sights.  And next time I'll bring a cooler.

{"text":"A great fish market! I had a lobster roll there a year ago and it was DELICIOUS! Only $5 for one roll and $9 for two rolls. So great!"}
{"text":"Broiled cod. Kinda tasteless without the homemade tartar sauce. 
Two smallish crabcakes for 5 bucks. I think Faidley's  Crabcakes in Baltimore is better

The clam chowder and the lobster bisque were pretty good. Worth coming again if you are in the area for these two soups.

Next time in town we'll bring some fresh fish home with our cooler. 

There's  a small supermarket on the other side of the fish market, so you can get something to drink other than caffeinated sugar water."}
{"text":"Spent the morning in the strip. No better place for strolling and people watching. 
Had lunch at wholeys cod sandwich fried to perfection. Moist white fish perfect amount of batter. Mancini roll. Heaven. 
Sister and niece had white cheddar lobster Mac n cheese.  WTH. Is was spot on flavor. 
Fries not cooked to my liking but cooked ok. I like my fries CRISPY. it's hard to get the fresh cut fries that way. ANYWHERE!!
Oh the best part. ANDY  the Sushi chef. 
AMAZING.  WHAT A CHARACTER. 
He hits you in the face at the front door. 
A must stop for fishies."}
{"text":"The food is really good and and incredibly affordable. For having the sign out front that says, \"the customer is always right,\" you'd think that the service would be a bit better. We felt incredible hurried (no one in line behind us) and when we tried to get condiments downstairs, we got scolded! The saving grace is the affordable, fresh seafood."}
{"text":"A staple in Pittsburgh shopping. My favorite thing is to come here @ New Year's Eve, and load up on cheap seafood, meat, delicacies, etc., and come home and have a big party with movies and not even watch the ball drop.

Wholey's has the best selection/price of seafood in the city. Everything is the epitome of fresh (you can watch them fillet fish with the motorized fish DE-scale-er, pretty gruesome). They also have lots of surprisingly good things... fresh squeezed juice, gourmet cheese, good nuts, olives, etc.

Wholey is a great Pittsburgh business that I'll forever endorse/support."}
{"text":"This was our last stop in the Strip District and oh, how I wished we were not continuing on north or I would have bought so much more.  The seafood selection is insane and I was incredibly tempted to purchase the slab of raw ahi tuna.  My daughter liked looking into the tanks and peeking at the live fish they sell.  There is also fresh meat, fruits, vegetables and cheese.  Might I suggest heading here for your lunch?"}
{"text":"We stopped in to try the oyster po' boy, the lobster mac n cheese and the lobster bisque.

The po' boy was just ok, the bread is not that great but the oysters were good. The lobster mac n cheese was delicious and you should definitely order it. The lobster bisque was ok, it wasn't hot enough."}
{"text":"I rarely buy fish actually, usually just bone-less chicken breast and other poultry meats.  The fish prices do seem high , to me but I realize it all must be flown/trucked here to PGH. from either coast .  Definetly a lively atmosphere and somewhere that every tourist / pittsburgh new-comer seems to drift to, eventually .  My new thing is buying my bone-less chicken breast there .  It's very fresh and tastes good without being rubbery like some chicken ."}
{"text":"There's the wholesale Fish Market that sells bulk and a couple blocks further there's the store that sells fresh seafood, grocery store of many items including produce and food vendors include a Pittsburgh BBQ,  sushi vendor and seafood counter that offers sandwiches and soup, as well as a large selection of fried seafood.  A train track above was cool bc the train is running.

The Cod sandwich was excellent, and I ordered the junior size (4 oz) and that was plenty for me for $3. , otherwise it's $5. for the regular size (that must be alot).  Also, the Boston clam chowder soup (8 oz) for $3, it was one of best I had.  Order the soup and sandwich special for $6. you get soup, sandwich and a drink. They have pkg of tarter sauce and hot sauce.  I went back another day and tried their crab cakes, but I didn't like it as much.  It was tasty, but greasy and smelled of oil.   I enjoyed the fish sandwich much better.  Crab cakes were 2 for $5.  

Also, I tried the crab and lobster bisque soup and that was pretty good too!  There was bits of lobster and crab in the soup.  I prefer the clam chowder bc I love clams!

Prices were very reasonable and I would go back again."}
{"text":"You want alligator? Of course you do. You just might happen to know a great allgiator etouffe recipe. Oh wait. That's me with the recipe. 

Well either way, Wholey's is a Pittsburgh institution. And anything you want as far as seafood goes, you will most likely find it here. They have a great meat section and produce available as well. 

If visiting, this just screams Pittsburgh. You can't really get a more old world vibe than this."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great fried cod sandwiches and sushi!!! Also great prices for fresh fish to cool at home!!"}
{"text":"As a fish market wholey's is pretty much one of a kind here in Pittsburgh.  Today was great I saw a tilapia jump out of the tank and land on the floor. The poor fish wanted out of his mediocre environment.  No worries though a staff member threw it back in the tank. 
I purchased some tilapia and gulf shrimp.  I could not find soy sauce on the shelves. When I thought soy sauce is a common enough ingredient. 
I always make it a point to stop into Wholey's when I am in the Strip."}
{"text":"Really like this joint. If you are a seafood fan, you will definitely come to appreciate it as they not only sell fresh seafood either fresh or frozen, but also a number of prepared foods with seafood embedded into the choices in their hot foods bar. My particular favorites are the lobster macaroni & cheese and the soft serve crab sandwiches. 

Lobster mac & cheese
Pros - taste is on par; a bit on the creamy side though, not too salty
reasonable portion sizes

Cons - lobster meat taste is overpowered by mac & cheese

Soft serve crab sandwiches
Pros - generous portion sizes ... it will definitely leave you full
authentic crab used, which is definitely appreciated
different sauces given to enhance flavor ... tartar, shrimp cocktail, etc. 

Cons - meat can be a bit dry at times ... probably due to overcooking

In general, a great place to hit up if you're a seafood lover."}
{"text":"It's fried seafood.  Who cares right?  Listen.

There's an art to this stuff.  

Two softshell crabs perfectly fried for $6 on a delicious bun?  I can barely fathom.  

Those fried oysters?  Perfection.

The grocery part is pretty good too."}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgh institution it's hard not to love Wholey's. Every time I enter Wholey's my first order of business is to get a pipping hot bag of hush puppies to much on while I wonder around the store.  Wholey's offers a fantastic seafood selection with a wonderful, knowledgeable staff to match. Along with the all of the fresh products you can pick up to take home, they have a pretty stellar kitchen and sushi bar which pumps out some very well prepared seafood. Most of the offerings are fried, but come on, who doesn't love a fried fish sandwich. When in the strip district, do yourself a favor and stop in for the hush puppies if nothing else."}
{"text":"I found this vendor via a google search a few days ago and placed an online order from Arizona. Given the size of my order, the 2 day shipping was FREE. The frozen meat arrived in a foam box packed with dry ice. Although some of the chicken wings were partially defrosted, the core temperature of this order was still below the temperature danger zone and most of my products including a leg of lamb, some lamb chops, and some sausages were still frozen. Given that I live in Arizona and it's 109 degrees outside, this was really quite impressive. This was incidentally why I ordered in bulk. Not only did I get free shipping but the extra mass helped keep this order nice and cold. 

Aside from the quality of the meat, the speed of shipping, and the condition of my shipment upon arrival, another reason I liked this company was that they didn't debit my PayPal account until my order was packed and shipped. 

Other online retailers (who debit accounts even if they're out of stock and are unable to supply an order) could take a lesson from Wholey's. I will definitely shop with them again."}
{"text":"Wholey's is superb for seafood shopping. Also they serve amazing lunches for pretty cheap prices. If you're ever in the strip, definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better in the Strip than a Wholey's cod on soft!!!  The fish is the freshest and tastiest ever. Always fried to perfection. Always order onion rings and others in party order the lobster Mac, which is fantastic.  Suggestion - if the onion rings have been sitting, order fresh, they will make them.  The soups are better than anything we've had in New Orleans!  The staff behind the fish sandwich counter are not always the friendliest, but that is easily overlooked because of what you get in the end - fantastic food.  The cashier is always very nice and friendly.

Yes, the parking to always had to get, but just be patient and wait it out in their lot.  (Wholey's just bought and tore down the candy store next to the parking lot for more parking).

Of course, the fresh seafood in the store is always the best and the meat is the best there is along with the produce and unique items they sell.   The butcher staff are so helpful and friendly.

Wholey's is the best place in the Strip!"}
{"text":"It's worth it just to go just for Andy's sushi stand! Cheap, super fresh, and delicious sushi - and Andy is a really fun guy too."}
{"text":"No Saturday morning trip to the Strip would be complete without a stop at Wholey's if for nothing more than a cod sandwich for breakfast.  Delicious, light cod on a Mancini bun is HEAVEN for only $7.  Bring a coffee from PrestoGeorge (next door) and you're set.  The upstairs seating is a bit dated and cheesy, but I love it!  

This weekend we picked up some frozen pre-cooked shrimp -- always good -- and stumbled across some AMAZING trout.   Deboned except for the spine.   The fishmonger chopped off the heads for us.  For dinner last night we sauteed them in butter and some seasonings and, for $5 each, we had a meal that would have cost $30 each in one of the upscale restaurants in town.  

Not a fan of the meats or produce, but that doesn't take away from the quality of the fish and seafood."}
{"text":"Must stop in kind of place. Just a great lunch spot the freshest seafood and huge portions for eat in service. Years ago I met one of the owners while having lunch and he was a real nice guy. I'm from the east coast and never figured Pittsburgh would have a better seafood market than the ones in NY but this place just is."}
{"text":"I, for one, doubt I will ever return here.  The smell of the place almost made me sick to my stomach and I almost did a 180 and walked back out the door.  Yes people, I know this is primarily a fish market, but I cannot put myself through that again.  I did make it through the whole store, but because of the overwhelming smell, I did not purchase anything.

In fact I ended up being like a little kid in here standing at the tanks in the back staring at the fish and lobsters.  I also marveled at the train that literally scared the crap out of me when I first realized it was there.  

Honestly I do not know if the prices here are better than other places as I was not too keen on looking, therefore I did not notice the prices.

I also did not venture to purchase one of their \"famous\" fish sandwiches...I don't think I could stomach it."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love Wholey's!  Now I must warn you that before you come here, be prepared for the smell.  Although the place is clean, it does have that strong fish smell.   Well, what do you expect?  It's a fish market!  But I absolutely love shrimp, and they have the best!  My other seafood weakness is salmon.  I've never had a bad salmon from here.  They've always been tender and flavorful.

As others have noted, you can get other meat and produce here too.  The meat here is pretty good--a cut (no pun intended) above average.  Rick really likes the pork chops from here.  I prefer to get my produce from other places in the Strip, but if I'm in a hurry, Wholey's is pretty good, if a little unspectacular."}
{"text":"First time visitor and I was blown away....I have been in many funky, elaborate, intricate, interesting, blah, blah, blah type of markets and this is as good as anything you would find in Pike's Market in Seattle. 
As soon as they nab you coming in the front door with all the fresh seafood showcases and the deli on your left, you're hooked! 

Sure, it ain't pretty, it ain't new and possibly the poor review from Mel below was because she, like my husband, she doesn't like the smell of what an old school fish market smells like. All I know is if we had something like this in San Diego, every Asian within 100 miles would be there every day. 

I mistakenly thought that when we first walked in, drawn in by the sale signs for crab cakes and salmon pinwheels, it would be in and out....but nooooo....it is just the beginning of a labyrinth that would boggle my freakin' mind. So on past the seafood, then past a huge showcase of all kinds of bacon (heaven) and fresh and homemade sausages, to a corner devoted to poultry to a ready made deli, it's a little like being \"Alice in Wholey Land.\" 

There's a veggie section with many fruits and green things and lots of very cool things scattered about on shelves and such. I saw lots of funky cheeses, soups and tidbits...you folks are really lucky. :o)"}
{"text":"My family and I like to order food, buy fish and meats when we find the time to drive up here all the way from Freeport. However, the layout is a bit awkward. You order your food, then wait while they prepare it. Once it's ready you grab your drinks, necessary condiments and pay. You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to sit down and eat. If you are new to this place, good luck finding everything before you food gets cold. I know it's a fish market in all, but it is still pretty disorganized for a place where you can get made to order food."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for fresh seafood. Their produce and meat sections are always on point. The prepared food...oh my stars, BEST fish sandwiches in town. Try the whiting. Get a whaler and share with others. Family owned and very friendly."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best grocery stores I've seen.

If you can find a similar place that serves oysters (the size of your fist) on the sidewalk, has this variety of fresh fish, has a giant talking bear, funny employees, and is overall this cheap - you need to let me know."}
{"text":"Been coming here since childhood and I always love walking by the rows and rows of fish. Although there is a fishy smell to the store, which may not put one in the right mind about the quality, I've never had a problem with spoiled or rotten fish here. Quality seems to be just fine.

The fresh fish selection is pretty vast. The ready-made crab cakes (usually 2 for $3) are a bit salty but I'm still a fan. Keep on wandering through the store and you'll find a nice variety of fresh meats, chicken, pork, etc and produce for pretty good prices.

As for service, the (older) gentlemen who clean the whole fish are pretty gruff . Honestly, they're a little intimidating and I wish Wholey's would/could do something to get friendlier service at this part of the store. The (younger) staff who work the cut-up fish stalls tend to be pretty friendly and so does the rest of the staff so it's a shame these guys get away with a less than ideal demeanor."}
{"text":"We live in downtown Pittsburgh and a Saturday ritual is a hike along the Allegheny eastbound toward the Strip district - that ritual includes breakfast at Pamela's followed by our weekly marketing a \"must\" part of which is Wholey's for our fish, meat and produce.  If they have it in stock, the Scottish Salmon is the best salmon I've ever had!  If you love seafood, and you can't find it at Wholeys, then it's probably gone extinct."}
{"text":"If you love seafood and sushi as much as I do... we can become best friends...

I really wanted to give this place four stars just because of their huge variety of seafood and meats...but after eating their home cooked lobster mac and cheese ... I have to say that mac and cheese was the most disgusting mac and cheese i ever ever had !! i would suggest you not purchase any of their hot foods! 

yes their are some really good/fresh seafood here...i wish i could purchase some of their fresh seafood since i was just staying at a hotel and far from home...there's no way i can try there fresh produce.. there's an outstanding \"fresh from the boat\" produces are great for seafood lovers... i guess this is where the better eateries get their seafood...."}
{"text":"I don't know where you can get fresher seafood I the city! Most of it is still swimming around!
The prices in the seafood are the best around, plus the variety is second to none.
We got a nice fresh cut of king salmon flown in from Oregon!
Plus, they have everything you need not just seafood
Fresh meats and sushi, candy and cookies and pots and pans! One stop shopping at its best!
The guys behind the counter are the best.
 They can not only tell you everything about the seafood, how they cut it when it arrived, but they can also tell you how to prepare it!
It's a pittsburgh staple! And it keeps on growing!
Fresh fish on Friday plus home made lobster bisque that is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"A trip to the Strip District, Downtown Pittsburgh isn't a good day unless I have stoped at Wholeys for lunch.  They offer the best cod fish sandwich combo with fries, coleslaw and a drink. 

Try the lobster Mac & Cheese. The smelts are wonderful! 

You do have to walk upstairs with no elevator to eat in, but the upstairs room is big enough to handle a large crowed of lunch time visitors. 

I enjoy having lunch at Wholeys and then walking through the store to grocery shop on my way out. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"great selection of all things seafood and nice little fast food places inside.  Some sushi, some deep fried fisherman's platters.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great fish selection. I get most of my seafood from Wholey's, it seems to be a tad bit cheaper than the fish in the grocery stores and it's by far way more fresh! 
I haven't shopped at their grocery store side or ate their pre-made foods so I can't speak to that. I only go there for some fresh fish. 
I definitely recommend buying your fish at Wholey's versus the grocery store. The nice thing if you don't live close you can stalk up and freeze it."}
{"text":"I'm a die-hard seafood fan and being from the caribbean has a lot to do with it. It's great to have Wholey's in town to find fresh, quality seafood at decent prices. I love eating my fish whole. I was taught at a young age that you determine the freshness of fish by its eyes. So buying fillets was also seen as a big gamble. I bought some wild caught snapper today and had it for dinner this evening. It was delicious. I also hit up Wholey's for salted codfish or baccalau. In Jamaica, we call it saltfish. Either way, Wholey's has a great selection that hails from Canada. Some salted cod are bony and have a ton of salt and very little flesh, but not the ones at Wholey's. Love this place!"}
{"text":"If you want seafood, you come to Wholey's. 

I regularly grab cod sandwiches from here as my dad really likes them. We get them on fresh Mancini bread and sometimes a side of coleslaw. 

The space itself is chock full of food, it can be very overwhelming, and tight in there! There is not much space to walk. There is a model train chugging away above your head. 

My recent visit involved having a Shrimp Po Boy (cooked to order!!!) as well as some Calamari. I just had water from the fountain drink machine (they have smaller clear cups for water). 

Service is very quick, you get the food, you pay, you're on your way! They have condiments after the register if you are purchasing ready to eat food. 

Cost wise, we were looking at $7ish for the po Boy Shrimp sandwiches and $4 for the side of Calamari. A small price for great seafood! 

We then proceeded to go upstairs to the dining area where we were greeted by Mr. Sam Wholey (one of the co-owners). I thought this was very nice that he is still there greeting customers and making sure everything is running smoothly. 

The sandwich and calamari were great! Shrimp was breaded and fried to perfection. The calamari was just slightly lacking as we got a few unsightly pieces, but I am not expecting 5-star perfect calamari so at least it was tasty. 

If you like seafood and you have not been here, you must make a visit! They have some of the freshest seafood in Pittsburgh too (although I rarely make my own, I prefer to get it pre made from Wholey's!)

Yes, it smells of fish. It is a fish market, if you expect anything else then I'm not sure what planet you live on. Bare in mind this is not an open market, it is enclosed inside a building, which may be why some people are so overwhelmed by the smell compared to an open air market."}
{"text":"Went there and bought quite a bit.  Not all the things are cheap as stated in most reviews.  Bought raw oysters @98 cents each.  Only able to open 4 and 5 was all mud inside.  Will be nice if they schuck the oysters even for a small fees.  Will try to cook them to see if they will open like clams.  Fish were very fresh."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part VII

I moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!

(For part VI, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/afRmUb4fRAis4pj4la81pg/review/37RV-CLTN_VtfuDV0aFwXQ?fsid=Z8qxRyyV5MsVe8lEfPWIYg)

Wholey's is the best fish market I've ever been to.  When you enter, Andy of Andy's Sushi greets you at the door.  To the left is the kitchen area that's been there for as long as I can remember, and to the right a room filled with fresh fish being scaled and filleted by experts.  

The kitchen is what I love the most about Wholey's.  When I was young, my parents would do their shopping, and before we left, they would pick up some fried shrimp for us.  We would then go back to the car and eat the shrimp on the tailgate of the car while watching all of the people go by.  If you buy fish from the market side of the building, you can then take it to the kitchen where they will cook it for you in whatever fashion you'd like.  Places like this are few and far between.

Instead of fried shrimp at the end of our shopping, I now make it a point to go to the kitchen first and get a cup of incredible lobster bisque to carry around while I shop.  The soup is so flavorful and creamy and is the perfect comfort food on a cold day.

In a very normal Strip moment for not only me, but just about everyone that I know, I didn't \"need\" anything, but I can't help myself when I'm here.  I picked up some pepper smoked salmon to have as a snack later in the day, and my mom went to town, buying what appeared to be nearly 400 lbs. of bacon, and a few bags of frozen calamari in her typical early preparation for Christmas Eve dinner (keep in mind that it's currently September).  

Thanks to Wholey's, I'm pretty sure that the majority of my inheritance has been frittered away by my parents.  My guess is that the folks have single-handedly kept Wholey's in business all of these years on impulse buys alone.  

Even if you don't have the need or travel means to buy a whole salmon or live crabs, Wholey's is at least worth checking out.

{"text":"I feel like a Pirate!

Well not really but I decided to head there for their 100 yr anniversary.   It was my first time and I was impressed if I wanted to buy some fresh fish.

I took my buddy there who was from out of town to share the experience.   We joined the line to order our food that started out the door.   I was confused because there is a Sushi Line and a separate line for the cooked variety.

One of the rubs - they were out of many things (Calamari, shrimp, etc...)    I could not try the assortment I wanted.

I ordered.  We received an abudance of food.    The fish was cooked very well.   The sides were done very well.

A second rub was the atmosphere.  You are in a fish market where they sell fresh fish.   After about 10 minutes in line, the smell is not the best (atleast for my appetite).    Once we received our food, we waited to pay (food getting cooler by the minute).

We paid and made the trek upstairs to eat.

I will do it again, I am sure."}
{"text":"I went to Wholey's today for a fish sandwich. I've bought fish and other things at Wholey's for 30 years and I've been mostly pleased with things I've bought there, but not today. The fish was lukewarm, almost room temperature, granted it was 2pm and probably hotter and fresher at noon, but that's no way to serve a fish sandwich. I ate upstairs and fortunately there was a microwave to reheat the fish, but the area had lots of flies, it left me with a creepy feeling, I wished I hadn't gone there at all and it's quite expensive by Pittsburgh standards, over $9.50 for a small fish sandwich with lettuce and tomato (another dollar) and a small cole slaw (another $1.25). One of the much better deals and a cleaner environment to eat in is at Loose Moose; they'll sell you a nice and hot fish sandwich with fries and a beer all for $5.50 on their days with sandwich specials."}
{"text":"This place is a burgh institution. You can get a fish sandwich or sushi, but it's famous for its fresh fish"}
{"text":"The Robert Wholey Fish Market is one of my favorite places in the Strip District.  I usually frequent Penn Ave fish, but honestly, I think I'll be replacing them with Wholey's after a few lackluster trips.

The best part is that Wholey's has a more fast food approach so you get your food quickly and can easily do to go or sit down.  The employees were very friendly and efficient.  There is also plastic wear, which is nice for those of us constantly on the go.

I grabbed an 8 oz. lobster mac and cheese ($3.50) one day, which is a nice side or snack size, and I could easily eat a large within minutes.  It's amazingly creamy with tons of lobster.  Delicious.

The fish sandwich prices are crazy reasonable as well, and I cannot wait to come back and try them.  

They did have a $10 credit card, minimum I believe."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to buy fish in Pittsburgh; Don't buy at wall mart or giant eagle there fish stuff sits around. Believe me I've tasted the difference; At Wholey's they keep their fish clean and fresh. 

Their grocery is really fresh and well taken care of. The place is run very clean and the staff are very nice and helpful. The fish selection is excellent if you want bass salmon lobster or eel they have it. They even have this toy train track that runs all along the store very gimmicky I loved it, it even keeps the kids distracted while I shop! Very Pittsburgh

They even offer to clean, scale removal, and cut the fish any way you want it. These are great services as for a cook these things are tiring and time consuming. 

I highly recommend this place to any smart foodies, shoppers, cooks."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Fish sandwiches are great.  Visiting Pittsburgh for the month and went there for the first time yesterday and am going to go back today!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we head down to the Strip, we have to stop here. My husband loves seafood (I hate it) and he really enjoys the selection. Their meat section is top notch!  Prices are really low, especially for how much you get. They have a great produce section. The staff is always very friendly. The store is clean, which is a feat in itself with how busy it always is. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love Wholey's.... why one may ask?  They have everything that we need and it is better than the regular grocery store selections of fish.  Every time I want Orange Roughy, Giant Eagle lets me down.  Wholey's does not.  They have everything.  They also have Gerbers Chicken breasts which I find to be some of the best.    Being able to get several things I like in one spot is something I like to be able to do as I am always short on time.


They also have a lot of basics as well so if you are in a pinch and need bread (they even have Pepperidge Farms Light Style which is what I often buy and not many places have this), some veggies, etc you will also find them here.  It is more than a fish market. 

Great prices, great selection... that is why I choose Wholey's."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that you have more than enough variety when shopping in the strip.  There are tons of great markets, local vendors, and unique shops just blocks away from each other.  Wholey's might not be the cleanest market in the Strip but it definitely has its appeal, and it worth the trip inside to see what they have to offer. Actually don't even go inside try some of the food that is cooked right outside, and you are bound to enjoy yourself.

You can lose yourself inside because there is just so much that this place has to offer.  Fish market, produce, spices, hard to find hot sauces, just to name some of the reasons why you are going to stay for while when perusing the aisles of Wholey's.  In addition, there is small fish kitchen inside which makes great fish sandwiches.  Definitely try one before you leave.  

The main reason why Whole's holds its value in the Strip is because it is an experience inside.  There is just so much to do in this marketplace, there is no reason to not take a look inside to see if you can't find something that you didn't know that you wanted."}
{"text":"Been coming here for most of my meats. They have an excellent and expansive selection of fresh meat and fish, all reasonably priced. The produce department is decent with consistently good quality green beans and brussels. It's helpful to check the produce market stalls along the strip then fill in the gaps here although the quality usually isn't as good as Wholeys. They do offer free ice so it can be helpful to bring your own cooler to pack your meats if you have other stops to make."}
{"text":"This is why I moved to Pittsburgh
for a market such as this ...
first off its located in the strip district great stores great eateries so its always worth coming to walk around.o
But parking can be a hassle no worries here
Wholeys has their own lot you can park in while you shop in the store.
The parking attendant is a nice sweet man who watches your car ...how do I know he is paying attention because someone hit my car and he had the store page me I love Wholeys
anyway go ahead park your car is safe 
then go on in
and you will be treated to a wonderful shopping experience
right in front is a small sushi chef ready to make your favorite rolls and such.
to one side there is a small hot food counter with fish Sammies and other assorted things such as fries and wings. (there is a nice seating area upstairs so you can sit and enjoy)
and then there is the fish counter its the entire length of the store
with friendly fish mongers to help you choose
in the back are tanks with the still living that can be on your plate later.
The fish sellers are so friendly and always helpful
I have bought salmon, flounder, tilapia and other assorted fresh fish its always good 
they also have a nice assortment of frozen fish 
The fish is a standout...
they also have a large meat section.
There is also their deli section delish fresh salads we have bought the coleslaw numerous times. 
They also sell yummy chicken pot pies ( I do not eat meat but son & husband love them)
plenty of fresh vegetables and other assorted staples to me the prices seem higher then a regular supermarket but everything always looks nice and fresh
and then their is the fresh squeezed orange juice its doesn't come cheap but its squeezed right there in front of you and by a real honest to goodness Wholey he is super friendly and you just feel good buying his juice.
I love this store with a passion and will not buy my fish anywhere else ever again"}
{"text":"Cool place to check out.  Lots of fried foods.  At the very least, you gotta try the lobster mac and cheese, good shit with shell mac and plenty of meat up in it.  Def worth a few bucks and a moment.  

there is a sushi stand right inside. FTW!...you cant get fresher sushi than that.

Huge selection of fresh as well as frozen seafood.  Big lobster tanks.  Friendly service.  Lots of well maintained seating if you wanna grab a sammy or some mac and cheese."}
{"text":"If you make one stop in the Strip District, it should be this place! One stop shop for everything you need from fresh seafood to meat to produce. I'm dying to go back and try their soft-shell crab sandwich and lobster mac & cheese because of all the great things I've heard!

I will warn you--- if you show up here on a Saturday afternoon, it's probably going to be PACKED and can get a little crazy. I prefer for go during off-peak hours either during the week or close to closing on the weekends. As annoying as crowds may be, it shows the quality of this place and if you have to deal with a bit of a crowd, I'd say it's worth it!

Probably not ideal if you have to run in for one quick thing.The store is a little bit of a maze and you have to walk through each room to get to the next. 

The seafood room is the first impressive sight you'll see when you walk in. You can also get fresh sushi made to order there. I've seen multiple people complaining about the smell in their reviews...but...umm.....it is a fish market.....so...the smell kinda comes with the territory! If you are easily skeeved out by the look or smell of fish, you'll probably want to walk quickly through the first room and keep your eye straight ahead to avoid the rows of fresh fish laid out behind the counter. But you'll survive. I believe in you!

Next you'll find the butcher area, then the deli, then freezer goods, then produce. They are often giving out samples of their lobster bisque around the deli area. WOW. Even if you don't get to sample, grab a container to take home and you can thank me later!"}
{"text":"awesome place. every time i go to the strip i need to stop by. the soft shell crab sandwich is amazing. the soups and crab cakes are also sick. they used to leave huge chunks of crab, lobster, shrimp and clams in their soups, but people kept filling their entire bowl with meat, so they sadly did away with that. they not grind it up so small it makes me want to cry. they also doubled the prices (at least i think) so it's no longer a steal. still damn good, though. their fish is about as fresh as it's going to get this far inland. i love getting a huge salmon flilet and having it for dinner. their meats are also pretty good, although i think you should probably go to strip district meats for that. their prices are real hard to beat."}
{"text":"It is really hard for me to review Wholey's in one post because I am not sure what the store is trying to be.  Is it a modern fish market? Is it a grocery store?  I would just like Wholey's to choose an identity and strive to be great at it.  

I was always taught that a good fish market shouldn't smell fishy. Too many times Wholey's smells like the inside of my tackle box. The fish selection at Wholey's is greater than your normal supermarket but not what I would expect from a top notch fish market. I am not a big fan of all of their processed frozen fish product.  Also the the quality to price ratio seems to be a little off.  With that said there are deals to be had if you pay attention.  My other issue is with Wholey's as a full service fish monger.  Every time I have had a question about a type of fish the staff had seemed pretty ignorant.  I would put them at the level of a giant eagle employee but lower than the monger at Whole Foods.  I also  take issue with Wholey's charging for scaling or even taking the fins and tail off of a fish.  This has been complimentary at any real fish monger that I have ever been to.

This weekend I purchased 2 pounds of the ocean perch filets that were on sale thinking that they would be a quick ingredient for a dinner party that I was hosting. Today, when I went to pull them out, I found to my dismay, that they were poorly butchered.  Every filet had large portions that had not been scaled completely and the filets had bones (not pin bones) hanging off the bottom. This added over an hour to my prep time and left me quite unsatisfied. If I had wanted to take the time to break a fish down I would have purchased whole fish from the start.  Needless to say I expected more from one of Pittsburgh's premier fish mongers. I also emailed Wholey's and have still not received a response.  

Will I go back? Probably. But only because they are the only place that I can pork belly that is not frozen  Just be aware that there are better fish mongers in Pittsburgh and even in the Strip."}
{"text":"This market sells a wide variety of fish and seafood. Outside of Alaska, they are my favorite business for buying crab legs. Today we spent $57 for 5 pounds of snow crab. The price is worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"Awesome lobster bisque.  Made fresh every morning.  Lobster is imported from Maine.  $9 for a quart."}
{"text":"Ah, Wholey's. How I wish you were in Austin. 

If you're looking for any kind of fresh fish or 20 different shrimp choices, this is your place. They also have a big meat section, a small produce section, and some other grocery items.

What I really love though is getting a huge fried fish sandwich or crab cakes and climbing the skinny staircase to eat upstairs in the dining room. Check out the picture I posted to see the huge amount of crab in the crab cakes."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch today on a bike ride through the Strip District.  The cool, windy fall weather put me in the mood for some warm comfort food, so I opted for the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster and crab bisque.  After debating about the sizes, I decided to get a small (8 oz.) mac and cheese with a Mancini's bread roll (upcharge of 65 cents) and a medium (16 oz.) lobster bisque.  I also had a small (16 oz.) homemade lemonade to go with my meal.  All of this set me back $12.20 w/ tax--not too bad!

The soup and mac and cheese definitely put me in my warm comfort food happy place.  The flavors and textures were pretty good, but they were both a bit on the salty side.  Dial back the salt a bit, and they could be excellent.  I'm glad I decided to get the roll with them, since I used it to dunk in the soup, and it cut the saltiness of the two main items.  I'm also glad that I had the lemonade, too, since its sweetness also helped cut the saltiness.  Based on the freshness of the roll, I'll have to check out Mancini's!

Service was pretty friendly, so no complaints there.  Yes, it does smell quite fishy when you first walk in, as well as over by the fishmonger and down in the basement where the bathrooms are located.  However, the upstairs seating area was nice and didn't smell too fishy to me (it's possible that my nose may have acclimated by then, though.)  There is a toy of some kind that kids play with that sings the same songs over and over and over again (I never did find it, but I could hear it clearly while eating my lunch).  It would be great if it could be moved to an area that isn't as audible to people sitting in the seating area.  (As a railfan, I loved the toy train, however!)  The only other criticism I have is the use of styrofoam cups. The soup bowls are compostable, which is great, but using styrofoam for all of the drink cups cancels out any environmental benefit.

Overall, this was a solid lunch, esp. given the quality:price ratio.  I'll have to stop by again sometime to try the fried fish sandwich, since that's Wholey's signature item.  If you're a seafood fan--or are in the mood for warm comfort food, I'd definitely recommend the mac and cheese and lobster and crab bisque.  It hits the spot!"}
{"text":"A very Pittsburgh experience is to visit the little food stand inside the big fish market know as Wholey in the Strip District. While you're in a big grocery store that specializes in seafood, it wouldn't be a stretch to presume Wholefoods ripped off the idea of dining inside a grocery store from Wholey's. The food is fantastic and you'll enjoy the atmosphere of everyone shopping for lobster, crab or scallops!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I hadn't written this earlier, but I always enjoy visiting and just passing by Wholey's whenever I am in the Strip. From the fresh produce (in particular the huge variety of seafood and meats) to Andy's sushi to the made-to-order grilled or fried fish near the entrance, the store is worth paying a visit even if you are not intending to buy anything. The variety of made-to-order food has been expanding recently as well. They've done lobster rolls and fresh oysters when in-season outside the store for a long time now, but I think it's only been recently that they started to do grilled salmon and lobster dinners as well. So you can actually get full-fledged meals while walking past without even going inside. I've only had the salmon, which comes with some grilled zucchini, and it is super flavorful and fresh coming straight off the grill. All of this together makes Wholey's a fun experience for any passersby."}
{"text":"I was sad they didn't have pickled herring in a jar but they did have other types of tinned herring. Lots of fresh fish, and yes its a pungent place."}
{"text":"Jumbo Scrod on Italian !

Just go to the counter and say , JUMBO SCROD ON ITALIAN .

Damyumnnnn , That's a Great Fish Samich.......

Great Price too. I have been coming here for years and I gotta wish these guy's a Happy Anniversary !"}
{"text":"For seafood, there is nobody with more selection.

Unfortunately we do not buy much seafood... little pricey just about everywhere.

We do purchase a fair amount of pork, veal, steak and ground meat. Used to visit Wholey's every two weeks for strip steaks, veal scallopini, pork roasts and other things. Thought the price and selection were very good... looking at the \"package cost.\" One day I looked at the per-pound cost. NO VALUE HERE! Real awakening.

I need to emphasize a point here: I have never had bad meat, seafood or produce from Wholey's. Everything has been first rate. However, depending on where you live, there may be better choices.

I now purchase meat from Mcginnis Sisters in Monroeville. Same prices, BUT the products are on-ice, unwrapped. Hmmm, not descretely covered with labels and stickers. That's important because, as you have learned, sometimes the bad looking stuff goes hidden under the label.

Two days ago I purchased two NY Strip Steaks from Mcginnis Sisters. Same per-pound price as Wholey's, but thicker, better looking and trimmed perfectly. Best strip steaks we have had in a few years. I will not buy anywhere else. 

Couple of grocery items we like: San Marizano Canned Tomatoes and Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock. Better price at Penn Mac nearby. 

Please don't think I am trashing Wholey's. The store is a great source for many things. Overall it is very good in selection, depth of stock and friendliness of employees. Much better than most supermarkets. 

Many of the reviews are based on the food eaten on-premises. I haver never done that. I have shopped for meat, seafood and produce to take home, uncooked.

I live in Murrysville. The time and gasoline cost make it more effective for me to purchase meat and seafood at Mcginnis Sisters. Guess what? It is better there!

What brings me to Pittsburgh: Penn Mac and La Gourmandine French Pastries.
Look 'em up. Visit. You'll love both places!"}
{"text":"the fish market was very interesting. i loved the sushi as you walk into the door yummy. the dips i sampled were delicious (loved the salmon one). also the popcorn and fudge smelled really tasty. i was excited about the food as i had never tasted lobster mac and cheese before. i tried it and i wasn't impressed with it,  but i was impressed with the super cool lobster and fish tanks!!!! kool market pittsburgh!! (btw i bought some italian sasugae links which were 5.00 for like 8). for my southerners from new orleans or other places please go to this market to get all the meats you may need for red beans or a crawfish boils they have it all!!!!"}
{"text":"Growing up in a restaurant my uncles would go pick up fresh seafood from Wholey's. They would always return with the best fish sandwiches I ever ate. Today the fish market is still there along with the still famous fish sandwiches. I remember being led into one of the the biggest walk-in refrigerators I had ever seen, to see a giant shark parked just above the door. Great memories and the greatest fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I could go on and on about how great Wholeys is, but for the sake of time I'll keep it short and sweet! This is the Holy Grail of fish markets! Not a better place for buying raw fish and seafood around! I have been going to Wholeys since I first started working down near the Strip about 2 years ago. A true Pittsburgh staple indeed! 

I am in love with the hot food. I know Wholeys is mostly famous for the fresh seafood and fish. But working in the strip I had to eat here for lunch. So one day I came down and ordered the grand daddy of all fish sandwiches, the 1ld. Great Whiting. I think I underestimated how monstrous this sandwiches was going to be. But the truth is, the fish is always fried to perfection! You also get to pick which kind of bun you want. Also, if you get the meal, includes coleslaw and your choice of side. I once got the Lobster Mac n cheese. Unreal. So good, it'll put grandmas mac n chees to shame.

For anyone else who spends tons of time in the Strip, it's nice to know that they also have ready made food you can grab on the go. They have lobster sandwiches, crab cakes and other cold items you can snag and go if you're in a hurry. One of the hidden gems in Wholeys, maybe hidden, would be Anthony's Sushi. If you know Anthony, there is nothing hidden about him or his personality. One of the bubbliest, happy kind of guy you'll ever met! And damn can he makes sushi! My Girlfriend has been eating his sushi for a year plus now and basically needs it to survive. All his ingredients are fresh and he is the quickest su-chef around! 

If you haven't been to Wholeys yet and you live in the area, what's your problem!? Go NOW!"}
{"text":"5* for two reasons. 
1) they have some of the best fried seafood in town.  Whaler = 1 lb of fried fish in a sandwich.  SO much fish that you can't really eat as a sandwich.   Fried oyster and fried soft shell crab are my other favors. 

2) good deal on live lobster.  I check their website weekly, and their lobster can be as low as $6/lb.  Yes, you have to do the killing at home, but it is live lobster.

Other things are ok too, I buy their spare ribs often. Live oysters are $1 each (DIY openning).  ANd they have a new fresh orange juice machine to make orange juice.  Love their carb selections too (snow, king crab leg, Dungeness)

Wholey is my seafood go-to in the Burgh, unless i am getting sushi-graded tuna / salmon."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Wholey's with my family for as long as I can remember. However, it was usually just for a quick stop during a morning on the strip. Last week, I came by with a group of kids from a local elementary school for a tour, and was so impressed by how friendly and helpful the staff were. They let the kids touch a lobster, and made themselves available for any questions the children may have had. Plus, the kids had a lot of fun getting the animal animatronics to sing.
I have always loved Wholey's for groceries, but now that I've had a chance to experience their customer service, I love them for that too! What a special place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It a bit of a trek from where I live but the seafood is great as well as all of the other amazing food they have there. I got some rock shrimp and lobster tails and they were soo delicious! Absolutely amazing. A must stop if you live in Pittsburgh,"}
{"text":"Great selection of meat and seafood. I have never bought the seafood here, but they have a variety of meat good for cooking just about any cuisine. From sausage casings to whole rabbits you can find just about anything. You can also reserve meat in advance. Every year my college organization would reserve 20 pounds of meat for our event. Was able to do so without a problem. Just call ahead a few days in advance.

They also have a section for fresh fruits and vegetables. They aren't as cheap as the local farmer's markets across the street and down the block, but still a little cheaper than Giant Eagle and a whole lot cheaper than Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I shopped for fruit here while walking the Strip District. It's an interesting store with sections for fish, meat, produce, and groceries. The store is cramped and crowded, but with limited space, that is to be expected. Still, I think they try to do too much. While there is a produce section, for example, the selection of produce they offer is limited. Still, I guess they're really the only game in town if you're in the city and need fruit."}
{"text":"I'm surprised people don't talk about it much, but my favorite part of Wholey's is Andy's Sushi Bar. Check it out!

{"text":"This is the place for a fish sandwich. It's a pound of cod nice and thick. I recommend the soft bun. Order to eat in pay then go upstairs to eat. Shop after."}
{"text":"I've been going to Wholey's since I was very very young - as far back as I can remember as a matter of fact.  Besides for some expansions and cosmetic upgrades here and there, the place has never changed.  This is about as good as it gets when it comes to traditional markets.  Besides for stocking up on the multitudes of fresh, unique and even bizarre seafood specialties, I would always get the fish and chips or a cup of those fried smelts at the hot-bar.  They've been serving these since - well forever ago.  Places like this give me the goosebumps in how real they are - don't expect anything pretty - no glitzie graphics, no wi-fi access, no keen-wa, no other latest and greatest \"hipster\" trends - just authentic awesomeness.  This is the kind of place where you feel like you are truly living the Pittsburgh experience and it makes this city the great and unique place it is."}
{"text":"Lobster Mac. Fish sandwich on Mancini bread. Do it. This place is cool. You should probably check it out if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Such a huge selection. AND you can have it delivered just about anywhere packed in dry ice. That's right. I had a box of lobsters and steaks delivered to my front door in Georgia. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Had a soft shell crab sandwich (7.50 with tax). It tasted okay, but I didn't know that the crab meat was supposed to be deep fried (welcome to Pittsburgh). I left feeling hungry however. The food preparation area did not look pristine and the upstairs eating area was a little dirty.

{"text":"I reviewed the entire Strip District, where Wholey's is located and said go just to stop at Wholey's. The Strip District is famous in Pittsburgh and has been around for years. Right in the middle of the Strip District is Wholey's. It is really a fish market, often crowded, and not always spotless, but keep walking in and you will see heaven for any fish sandwich lover. I have been there more times than I recall. It is always great. It is always the same. The fired fish is just so tasty. It is not even close to healthy, but who cares, it is wonderful. The seating is very limited so be ready to stand, or take a walk with your food. There is some seating with stools but don't count on it. The prices are fair. The service is friendly. Go there."}
{"text":"WOO-HOO!  That's the way I feel inside when I step foot in Wholey's Market, every time.  

The anticipation is awesome, and everything just hits you all at once--the sights, the sounds, the smell!  Fish and crustaceans are everywhere.  People are everywhere.  Customers and butchers are calling out orders.  It's...EXCITING!  Such a great seafood, meat, and produce market.

Children always seem to have a blast at Wholey's.  They get a kick out of the live fish and lobsters in the tanks in the back.  You can also introduce them to Wholey Bear (who wears an old #55 Porter jersey out front on the sidewalk) and Rachel the Pig (who collects donations for the Children's Hospital).  Then there's also what I call \"The Steelers Fisherman\" and \"Mr. Penguin.\"  I'm not making this stuff up; these things exist and should make sense if you've been to Wholey's!

Now, an interesting little tangent.  Ever see the movie \"10th & Wolf?\"  It's a pretty good 2006 organized crime film that's set in Boston but was filmed in Pittsburgh.  Towards the end of the movie there's a dramatic chase scene--right through Wholey's!  You see the name on the door and everything.  Pretty cool, huh?!   

I'm removing 1 star only because of the produce; there always seems to be a noticable amount of overly ripe stuff on the shelves when I visit Wholey's.  Pears automatically come to mind.

Anyone who appreciates seafood and/or traditional butcher markets shouldn't miss an opportunity to check out Wholey's!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem on the Strip.   FRESH seafood, meats, a hot food counter with several options including lobster mac and cheese.  They offer a few types of fresh fish that they will kill and clean right there for you.  This place is hugh."}
{"text":"Sorry Wholey's I really hate to do because I love your grocery store (4 stars in it own right) but your prepared food just wasn't that good.  I have now been to Wholey's twice recently to have their food and eat upstairs.  The most recent of those visits was this weekend at around 3:30 PM whenever I stopped in for a quick bite and the time before that was two Tuesdays prior for lunch with my father.  What is weird is that I have been shopping in Wholey's for years and never knew that they had a cafeteria type line with prepared food.  Somehow I always found myself turning to the right immediately upon entering and looking at all of the different types of fish.  However, if you end up turning to the left then you are able to go through a prepared food line that probably resembles the one back in your old high school cafeteria.

The first time that I ended up eating here I went with the crab cakes lunch combo which consisted of two crab cakes, a large side of fries, a small tub of cole slaw and a drink all for right around $9.  With that price I was not too surprised that the crab cakes were fairly small but at least they were tasty.  The fries were also tasty as they had some type of seasoning on them that I really enjoyed but the bad part was that they were cold.  Last but not least in the meal was the cole slaw which was decent and unremarkable.  After this visit I probably would have given a solid 3 star review but I didn't get this review finished before I stopped by here again.  The second time I ended up ordering the whiting sandwich on a mancinis wheat bun.  What is nice is that you have a choice between 3 different buns, two mancinis (white or wheat) and another regular bun.  They also really heap the fish onto your sandwich for the price.  Whenever I started eating the fish I thought it was weird that some bites of the fish were super fishy while other bites were mild and more of what I was expecting.  That I could have accepted but what really turned me off of the sandwich was the five or so pin bones that I found when biting into the one side of a piece of fish.  Yes I understand that a pin bone of two happens every now and again but it seemed like this one piece of fish really hadn't been cleaned properly before it was breaded and fried.

The bottom line for me is that even with a not so great last experience I will still head back here again in the future.  I really love shopping for fish, meat and produce here and feel like they have some of the best selections and prices around.  Due to that I am sure that I will give their cafeteria another chance but I will most certainly be avoiding the fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Sushi guy is great.
His avocado is not.
Somehow, I'll return."}
{"text":"When I think of the Strip District, one of the first places that comes to mind is Wholey's. My husband and I have always enjoyed browsing around the fresh fish and meat. Though I'm not great about knowing competitive prices myself, I came here with my sister-in-law about a year or two ago, and she was extremely impressed with how inexpensive everything was. 

Currently, two of my favorite things from Wholey's are their fresh peanut butter (try the honey roasted, too) and their guava jelly. The peanut butter is out-of-this-world delicious. The guava jelly isn't mind blowing, but I can't find it at the local Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's, so I love that I can get it somewhere in Pittsburgh. (My mom grew up in Africa and my dad's mom was from Cuba, so I inherited a love of guava from both sides!) When my husband and I came here last weekend, we bought jellies and sauces for some family members as Christmas gifts, so I can't wait to find out what they think of all the items."}
{"text":"this is just for their famous 1 pound fried cod fish sandwich.  i split it wiht someone else, but it was still a behemoth.  and it sounds crazy to say because it's a 1/2 pound of fried fish that i ate, but it was really light.  add tartar sauce and there was also some sort of a fruit sauce that we added - delish.  market is smelly, but upstairs seating let's you get a little relief from that while you eat.  this place is a landmark."}
{"text":"My favorite place for meat and seafood. They offer some of the freshest selections of fish and shellfish that I've had. All for a reasonable price. There's even a small cafe-like area upstairs for times when you just can't wait to get your fish fix. (I strongly recommend their po'boys.)"}
{"text":"WoW ! What a Place. Every Type of Fish, Cooked for You or Take it and Cook at Home. Also they Carry Just about Anything Else You Could be Looking for."}
{"text":"Wholey's has really become our primary grocery store. The prices on fish, meats, and produce are excellent, and the selection is solid. Yes, they don't have the overall Market District grocery selection, but the freshness and selection of seafood is unmatched, and you can find anything that you're looking for while shopping there. They just might not have 100 different choices of grape jelly. Even if you can't find everything you're looking for, I'd say Wholey's is the ideal place to start your shopping for meats and fish, and you can cross the rest of your grocery list off at the other places in The Strip.

As Rachel C. pointed out, be prepared to be slightly overwhelmed by the fishy smell, but you won't find a fish market anywhere that doesn't smell that way, so just accept it as part of the experience and then go home and enjoy the fresh seafood that you just bought for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Walking down Penn Avenue on our first day back and second trip to Pittsburgh of 2016 the sky is grey and low and the sidewalks are grimy and slick. The Strip District is the bottomland where the rivers converge. These days it's a mix of blue-collar mechanical, small local retail, warehousing and up-scale residential in converted factories. Comfortable for middle aged tradesmen and young developers, designers alike. If you belong to either of these worlds you feel right at home here.
We are going to Wholley's. When I see the red and white striped design of the awnings up ahead my heart leaps a little.

There is a lot to like about this city. There is an awfully lot of good food to be had from a diverse array of cultures. The thing I've fallen head over heels for and that on paper you can find anywhere but that in reality can only truly find here and is really special is fried cod on a roll.

That sounds silly and it makes me sound like a silly person for saying it. But it's not silly. And goofy I might be, for the five month interim between visits I had fish and chips or fish sandwiches from all over and was always disappointed. Isn't flavor about alchemy? Isn't cooking magic? Add one piece of batter fried cod (or two, either way it's so much your eyes will bug out when you see them assemble your meal) to one fresh baked roll from Mancini's bakery next door (that's another story and by God they are good too!), add hot or tartar sauce and it equals one really good sammich.

I smoked for most of my adult life and I know what cravings are like. Addictions are ever present and are squirrely in the way they worm their way in and out of your thoughts. I craved a Wholley's fried fish sandwich for five bloody months and get this, it didn't disappoint.

You will read a lot about places that you need to go to when you're downtown in the \"Burgh\": Primanti Bros, Deluca's... ( I love Deluca's too...bring Cash $$ BTW) but the place I would suggest is this place. Get a fish sandwich. Get a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese. Or maybe onion rings. Get it at 9:00 in the morning for breakfast (we did this like...three days running). Have it for lunch. GO UPSTAIRS and sit in the lovely rustic dining area (Read: exposed plumbing, worn carpet, bus yr. own table and tear a new sheet of butcher paper for your table when you leave TKS VRY MUCH). Absorb the ambiance. Listen to the animatronic cow down stairs. Or the model train that runs around between floors. Afterwards walk through  the fish market, the butcher shop and small grocery. Have some pink fudge and a mix of cheese and caramel popcorn for a snack. Walk back to the apartment and crash on the couch with your lover and look off into the distance down the river and stare at the hundreds or bridges and decide where you want to have dinner. If you need it."}
{"text":"Ahhh, yeah. This place makes me so happy and helps reinforce my return to Pittsburgh from the West Coast. This is a great people watching spot and an even better place to buy any kind of seafood under the sun. Great prices, nice staff, and AMAZING sushi by Andy. Yeah, it gets packed and there are a lot of elderly folks who can be very slooooow, but it is a nice example of local Pittsburgh color. A MUST visit for any seafood enthusiast. I am lucky to work right up the street so I have lunch here at least once a week."}
{"text":"They have lots of seafood and fish options. They also have a really decent meat and vegetable selection. I will definitely bring my seafood loving dad here to get some food."}
{"text":"I'm allergic to seafood but love every sort of market under the sun. For years I have strolled on past Whooley's thinking it was a mini seafood market with nothing for this girl. Boy, was I wrong!

-fresh rolled sushi (he had a sign hanging as one of the best of Pitt magazine)
-cases upon cases of living fish, lobsters, you name it 
-fresh produce 
-samples
-seating are upstairs for those who decide to plunge in to the soft shell crab sandwiches or clam chowder 
-multiple types of seafood salads

Definitely worth adding to your Strip District itinerary."}
{"text":"First, let me let y'all in on a little secret- the ribs here are amazing! Like every time I've made them and brought them to a party I get at least a few people saying they Are the best ribs they've ever had awesome. It's a decent fish market for a landlocked city like Pittsburgh but after living in the DC area and visiting markets in the DMV, I'm afraid I've been a bit spoiled. And I'm not sure why it smells so fishy all of the time- it's not like that at fish markets down my way. It's frequently very crowded because in this are, unless you want to pay Giant Eagle prices for seafood (uhh, no thank you!), this is it. The produce is actually of good quality for being so cheap so take a look at that while stopping in. This is a Pittsburgh tradition so I highly applaud the efforts here, and I do recommend at least taking a walk through if you're in the Strip. Oh, and buy the ribs to make at home, just trust me."}
{"text":"It's the fishery wharfs of pittsburgh!!!!!! Has a whole area dedicated to fresh seafood, a meat department and groceries and food court which serves CHEAP ASS lobster sandwiches that were 2 for $9!!!!! It was sooooo good I bought some with me on the way back to toronto....also had this gigantic fish sandwiche and Mac n cheese lobster which was pretty good....no where in my mind did I think that pittsburgh would have fresh seafood....wish we had this back home in toronto"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple - Wholey's is a fantastic place to eat and shop! Despite being on the strip, there's parking set aside for Wholey's customers while they shop/eat, so it's easy to get there even on the busiest of days. The restaurant/store is incredibly lively and fun, and you can catch the owners themselves walking around and working on some days. 

My family and I stopped in to eat here, and we ordered clam chowder, lobster mac n cheese, fried smelt, crab cakes, calamari, and fried oysters (we LOVE seafood if you couldn't tell). You order food in a school cafeteria style setting, and they have places to sit and eat upstairs as well. Most of the food on the menu is fried, but the amount we paid for the quality and quantity of food we got was incredible. We also stopped outside to eat some raw shucked oysters, which were fresh and flavorful.

Wholey's is a quintessential Pittsburgh experience, and the food never fails to hit the spot. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Foodie paradise!!!

We had so much fun shopping here, I swear we stayed nearly an hour.  I had no idea how big the store was!  First I thought it was just seafood, then I saw meat, then I saw fancy groceries and produce - it's everything you need!  And it's (mostly) well-priced!

Some items seemed a bit overpriced, but most were very reasonable.  We got some lovely salmon for only $6 a pound.  I think it was \"salmon tail\" so maybe that's a cheaper cut, but it tasted lovely and fresh.  We also got very inexpensive and HUUUUUGE chicken breasts.  These things were massive!  You wouldn't think that it mattered where you get boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but you can tell there was something special about these.  They were just...plumper.  And they smelled fresh and looked gorgeous.

We also got a pound of also very inexpensive housemade hot Italian sausage that was soooo yummy!  Made it tonight with rigatoni in tomato vodka sauce.  It would be a wonderful accompaniment to any meal.

We've only been in the Strip District once, but we'll definitely be back to visit Wholey's again!"}
{"text":"Coming from Boston, you wouldn't think i'd be blown away by Pittsburgh fish market, but you'd be wrong!! This place is heaven for seafood lovers. Fish of all kinds, clams, bivalves, scallops, crabs, and more are overflowing from the coolers. Even the vegans in my party were astounded by the scale and variety of Wholeys. There's a restaurant upstairs so you can eat some of their delicious seafood. It's almost like hometown Walmart for fish."}
{"text":"They have ginormous fish sandwiches. Seriously, you need three stomachs for this thing. They also have all the fresh seafood you could possibly want."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the lobster macaroni!  The prices are pretty good to me, but I am land locked and any chance I have for fresh seafood, I enjoy it. They ship anywhere and have a large variety of seafood. This is always a stop when visiting family and I highly recommend a stop if you love seafood like myself."}
{"text":"Decent lunch for a decent price.   Nothing fancy. Ate upstairs. Clean.  Staff was friendly.  What else?  No violins or views of the Poinit ..."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! They have everything and all in one store. You can order lunch when you walk in and they have a seating area for you to eat. I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich and the lobster Mac n cheese. The sandwich was made to order and super fresh. I didn't really care for the lobster Mac n cheese. The lobster was tough and over cooked. The register didn't accept credit cards so I had to walk all the way to the end of the store and wait in a separate line to check out. I wish I lived in the area to shop here regularly! Everything looks so fresh!"}
{"text":"Prices on fish can't be beat and the quality is very good.  Often crowded, especially on weekends.  
The staff are often helpful as well.

This place is a strip district anchor for a reason.  

Andy's Sushi is also excellent."}
{"text":"What a great place not just to buy seafood to take home and cook yourself but also a great place to sit down and eat some excellent fried or grilled seafood. I only wish they were open later for dinner.

Love the $3 fried calamari, $2.50 fried clams, and smelt by the quarter pound. A variety of fish and chips available too. Lunch at the outdoor grill looks really good too with grilled to order Salmon and seared Ahi.

There is a big dining room upstairs with communal picnic like tables, as well as a picnic table at their small free parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"I know, I know...it's heresy to dis Wholey's in Pittsburgh....I can't help it, though.  The smell when you walk through those doors turns me off immediately.  A fish store should NOT smell like decaying fish!  Maybe I'm spoiled from the time I spent in MD and all the truly fresh fish in clean fish stores that don't stink   In a pinch, I'll pick up what I need, but it's worth the extra step to hit Benkovitz on Smallman.  Benkovitz is clean and smells like a fish store should....it DOESN'T smell."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, fresh meat and good frozen fish too.  

Not a bad place to pick up, or, rather, pick out fresh produce in season, either. (I disapprove of the Stan's Market wrapped-in-plastic approach.) The staff is nice and they keep the lines moving, even on a busy day.  

Don't neglect to get the extra ice at the checkout - a charming and old-fashioned touch that never should have gone out of style.  It keeps your stuff nice for the trip home.

Foodies visiting Pittsburgh's Convention Center would do well to hike/cab over to \"the Strip\" to visit Wholey's and Penn Mac for lunch, dinner, a snack or some shopping, rather than exploring downtown."}
{"text":"Arrived in town and this is the first place I come to visit. Everything was very fresh and clean. Prices were very reasonable, and service was knowledgeable, extremely quick, and friendly. Their seafood section is awesome. I bought two lobster rolls and they were so good.
I honestly cannot think of anything that would make this place any better than it already is. Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best blue crabs by far! If you want good take-out seafood, that is fresh, I suggest you eat here!"}
{"text":"I used to shop here with my grandmother during my summer visits but that was 40yrs ago and I did t appreciate the value back then, because honestly I wasn't  spending my money. Fast forward..I had forgotten this place and recently while visiting my 95yr old grandfather, I stumbled across this forgotten gem from my childhood memory and was pleasantly surprised by all the fresh fish, meat and produce at reasonable pricing. They even provide you with bags of ice, which was needed for my crab claws and Chilean sea bass 6 hour trip back to NYC. Now every time I visit this is where I stock up on my monthly food supply, although they have informed me that they will ship to my location. Thanks Wholey's for preserving my childhood memories, my wallet and not to mention the tasties fresh fish ever! Friend for life..."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the Strip District, I always try to make sure I stop in for a fish sandwich. They are huge and delicious. The only thing I wish though, is that it stayed open longer. It closes way too early for me. Next time I'm there, I will snap a pic of the Wholey Whaler samdwich....stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Closing time is 6pm on Saturdays~  

The bf and I went to grab some food to 'sneak' into the drive-in movie. We got a lot of seafood!! 
Total came out to be $36.32  

Let's start from the low to the high. 
Lobster bisque - scoop your own - Medium was ~$3.50. I did not enjoy this much.. the \"lobster\" was actually crawfish. but I guess you can argue that they are little lobsters. but it was the flavoring that didn't appeal to me. I don't recommend it. 

2 pcs crabcakes $6.50 pretty oily but large chunks of crab meat! yummy.. not much breading. just the way i like it. It's about 3 bites for me. I did think it looked a bit overfried though since the breading looked like it was on the verge of getting burned. 

fried calamari - $3.99 great saltiness and flavor. Nice portion. We didn't eat this until it was a bit too soggy but it woulda been awesome if eaten immediately. 

Lobster rolls $6  each - 2 in a container. They were in multiple sections so we found a container w/o more tail meat and less of claw. It was delicious!! a bit more mayo than I'd like but not bad at all. 

cod fish sandiwch ~$7 - this was huge!!  originally we were going to get four lobster rolls but switched 2 rolls to 1 fish sandwich b/c we saw the fish and it looked delicious. Two pieces of fish in each sandwich - we ended up splitting the sandwich and made 2 open-faced fish sandwich."}
{"text":"I am not sure why anyone would give this market less than 5 stars.  I have read other reviews about the fishy smell but let me tell you, I was born and grew up at the Jersey Shore where the fresh seafood is stellar, and every fresh fish market will smell slightly like fish.  Fish has a bit of an odor, especially when the market dresses their catch and has refuse.  They have a lot of fresh caught whole fish on ice and a huge variety of dressed filleted choices.  There is lobster, shrimp, oysters, clams, octopus, and a bunch of underwater fare.  Please do not be put off by a slight fish smell, this place has AMAZING fresh seafood and they pride themselves on quality.  Give em a try, I am sure that you will be glad you did.  Take it from a Jersey Shore girl who grew up on fresh seafood, unless you are out on the ocean with a pole and hooks, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh fish and meats! The best in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Wholey's has a large selection of fish, meats, and produce. Wholey's probably has the largest selection and variation of goods in the Strip. Based on the prices I noticed, I would assert that the prices here are on par with Giant Eagle. Obviously, some goods are a bit more expensive while others are a little less expensive.

Despite having 'Fish Market' in the store's name, I have to say that the main draw were the prices in the meat section. I was able to pick up three cuts of thin NY Strip Steak and three cuts of Filet mignon for a bit over $12 for each. $4 for a cut of Filet Mignon! I'm not sure if there was a sale or a pricing error but wow. And I had no complaints about the quality of the meats.

Wholey's is certainly worth a stop when visiting the Strip. Pay attention and you might find a great deal!"}
{"text":"When you hear the name Wholey's Fish Market, you think...FISH! Duh, of course. And while the do have a great selection of fish and seafood, their selection of meats and poultry is really awesome. I swear you can get pretty much any part of an animal you're looking for; chops, loins, innards...peaks...butts! I saw an assortment of exotic ground meat like Elk and Boar today that really got me thinking. They have produce and a small grocery section with normal stuff like butter and canned goods. Their little deli section has surprisingly good prices. And when I am making pepperoni rolls, they are my go-to for sliced pepperoni; it's Hormel, the same I can get at Market District for about 2 bucks less. They have a Champagne ham that my mother loves and some really interesting cheeses. The deli also has an assortment of salads like ham, antipasto and seafood. But I would beware; they're not very good. The antipasto especially is...not good. I think one of my favorite parts in the hot foods/restaurant part. You can get fish sandwiches and fries and stuff. The cod fish sandwich is pretty good and the smelts are awesome. The BF says they're just bait fish, battered and deep fried, but I still think they're yummy. One thing to remember, they only take credit cards over 10 dollars which I think is odd in this day and age, but...."}
{"text":"This place is a Pittsburgh classic! If your ever in the strip this is a must stop by on the list. I like to come here and get wings there the jumbo ones! There super famous for there fresh seafood department. And lobster Mac! I decided to swing by and pick up a fresh rabbit and some of there own seasoning. I got a two pound rabbit for around 10 bucks and the seasoning for around 3 bucks. The cool thing is when your leaving they have a ice cart they you can scoop a little in your bag to keep food cold on your drive back home. I've also never had a bag break or leak in the car so your safe there! I highly recommend coming here and trying all the delicious food they have to offer!"}
{"text":"I am completely amazed at their wide range of seafood. The prices for the crab legs and claws are incredible. Sadly their Potato Salad from the fresh salad bar was a let down. It was tasteless, but I highly recommend everyone to get their seafood from Wholey. Five stars indeed."}
{"text":"Really fresh, good fish. Picked our fish while it was still alive, and bought pork belly. They had an amazing swordfish sample and an employee happened to walk by, carrying an entire swordfish. Also happened to be Rosie the Pig's birthday, so they were handing out birthday cake. Truly an experience!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection of food.  I picked up some gulf shrimp to brine and broil at home, an ahi tuna steak, fish seasoning, smoked bacon, and spicy pork sausage.  I can't wait to cook up all my food at home.  
The lunch I order was good too.  I specifically liked the crab and lobster bisque.  I at upstairs in the seating area before headed to the front of the store to check out.  I was really impressed with the knowledge of the staff, their professional friendly attitude, and the information they provided me about the products.
I was really thankful they provided free ice on the way out the door as I needed to keep my purchases cold on my way back to Michigan.  The next time I'm in Pittsburgh I will have to make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Wholey's... It's the beating heart of the Pittsburgh Strip District. 

Fresh seafood, always. They have selection,  quantity and tremendous variety. And everything that goes with everything, right down to a very large recipe rack!  Fresh isn't working for you?  Then take it canned or frozen. Selection is how you prefer. 

Great hot foods, take out or a cute eat in area to enjoy your choices.  One word:  SMELTS.

Fresh meats, reasonably priced!  Including duck, rabbit, buffalo and other harder to find offerings. 

Fresh produce, including freshly squeezed OJ.

If you must limit your Strip visit, Wholey's can be your \"one stop\"."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese guy that has the sushi stand right as you walk in makes the best sushi I have ever had in my entire life. He's also friendly; he'll talk with you, joke with you, and give you a free taste of whatever he's making. Also, where else can you get two soft shell crabs for $6? This place is a steal. The seafood is extremely fresh as well, with a selection that will blow you away."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful cod sandwich here at Wooley's  for  breakfast. Always fresh, always crispy and wonderful. This was on our bucket list for when we visited from Florida. In fact, eat your heart out Florida. No fish market like this one."}
{"text":"If you are on the strip, this is another must stop. So many kinds of fish and other seafood as well as other goodies. Lots to see. Very helpful staff. Have your camera ready because you can get some cool photos."}
{"text":"This is a classic spot for fresh seafood, and other fish products.  Very well managed.  All appears fresh and since I lived on the coast in Japan the smell is just natural for an enclosed seafood place.  Staff was knowledgeable and helpful.  Oysters available but I am not a raw oyster person -- but they can be purchased for deep frying at home.  Fresh product and prepared products also available with a huge supply of condiments."}
{"text":"food was okay  but i was insulted by robert wholey and his racial ignorance. will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is great. Coming here made me realized that I could live in Pittsburgh. When I saw the quality olive oil being sold here, and not seen as an exotic coup, I knew that a home kitchen has hope for sustainable cooking.  It's quality all over the place, and there's even more on the strip to back it up. 

Wholey's is also the reason I want to come back to Pitt. I need to try at least one fried fish here."}
{"text":"fish sandwich was delicious and packed with lots of tasty fresh fried fish. it was perfect with the massive amount of tartar sauce I piled on. the fried chicken was very salty though. as for their market selection, i was really surprised at how much fresh seafood they had and also their little grocery section with veggies, fruits and specialty foods which was very well stocked. wish we had a place like this in the SF Bay Area"}
{"text":"This is an amazing fish market that is so much more than its name! It has fish, meats, food, and more! I just happened to walk by here and saw it was quite popular. I walked in and got so excited! Fresh fish, restaurant inside, sushi bar, and an entire meat isle too. The staff is super friendly and if you come here you have to get food - whether it be from the restaurant (I recommend the Lobster Mac&Cheese) or the sushi bar (I recommend the kani & spicy tuna roll). The fish are beautiful and fresh! The atmosphere is cultural and a great local market that I am surprised is not packed. If you are in Pittsburg and want to see something unique and get a bite to eat - COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Warning: Do not let the fish and meat section keep you away from this Strip District gem. They have awesome prices and have a ginormous selection of seafood, meat, produce and more. Saving tons on groceries here and eating fresh-barely go to Giant Eagle anymore cuz it is way too over priced. Only down fall is that produce needs to be eaten within a few days...fine with me because that is an excuse to eat healthy and go back for something else. Parking is across the street and remember, they do have carts. Go outside of your comfort zone and check this place out."}
{"text":"Great place to get fresh fish and meat. But they also serve a killer fish sandwich which you can eat in a hidden dining room upstairs! It's like a half pound of fish!"}
{"text":"Fried fish! Delish! Super friendly staff. Pass on the fried oysters, they were not very good and tasted mush. The lobster rolls at 2 for $9 was a great deal. next time i'll try the crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Delicious fried cod fish sandwich for $6.50. Some of the other prepared food was just okay I think, such as the lobster roll and bisque.

Meat market has great selection overall. I'd probably shop here on the regular if I were a local."}
{"text":"Wholey's is a famous fish market in town, but I truly do think it's overrated.  There's an enormous variety of fish here, but other fish markets in the Strip that don't necessarily have the variety of Wholey's beat it soundly in terms of consistent quality and consistent freshness of the fish.  Some of the fish that is offered is good and very fresh, but some of the other fish doesn't look great to me -- the eyes are dull and clouded, etc.  Another reviewer said to \"be prepared for the smell, but that's what you expect in a fish market.\"  I agree that Wholey's fish department smells of overripe fish, but I disagree that that is acceptable in a fish market.  Other fish markets in town do not smell of rotten fish.

Wholey's is also pretty crowded, and tries to do too many things at one time.  I think it could be a good fish market if it was not also trying to be a restaurant, a meat market, and a grocery store.  On the whole, you can get some good buys here, but you have to be very aware of exactly what you're buying."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a Whaler before leaving town.  I'm so glad they have a small parking lot for whiskey shoppers.  This worked well.  I was able to park, get in and out of line in less than 30 minutes.  The Whaler is a 1lb fish sandwich.  Fresh whiting stacked on a soft bun.  It's difficult for one person to eat so we tend to buy a couple to split with the family.  They have an area where you can get hot sausage, old bay and tarter to go too.  This is a great market and it never disappoints.  I grew up coming here so it's a must do while back in Pitt!!  The staff is always efficient and helpful.  I  Wholey's. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was caught in a downpour and wanted to get a quick bite. They had a tent where they were offering oysters for free and if I wanted to purchase a lobster salad sandwich i could. Price was reasonable $7.00 for one or 2 for $13.00. I bought one and it was made on a hot dog bun. It was real lobster chilled and tasted very good. I walked inside briefly to get out of the rain and I could smell fish everywhere.

Course that's what one would expect in a fish market. Since I was not purchasing fish for home use I waited out the storm and left. I probably will stop by again if they have another outdoor venue for this sandwich. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY RUDE CARPARK ATTENDANTS
I tried to visit Wholey last Saturday morning. After parking our car we headed McDonalds to get a quick lunch as usual - we'd rather not having frozen seafood sitting in the trunk for 20 minutes.
But the carpark attendants came and almost threatened us to move our vehicle in an extremely ill-mannered and uneducated way. Made me reconsider if I will ever go to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is impressive.  When you walk in, you will be hit with the unmistakable smell of the sea - but not of the sea sitting out too long.  Everything looks fresh, and some items are still swimming! From your basics like salmon to more exotic items, there is basically everything you may want for a seafood feast."}
{"text":"generally I'm  a fan of this place but, I bought some frozen fish there and it was terrible. When it was cooked (baked) it turned out so tough that you couldn't cut it. Also it tasted freezer burned. I guess it was freezer burned, it tasted like soggy paper. I have never had a problem like this before. I didn't take it back because I had bought it the week before and didn't have a receipt. I steamed the rest of it for about 10 min and several more of the fillets were just like the first. The dog didn't mind, but it did make for expensive dog food."}
{"text":"This review is for the prepared cooked food. When I walked in, I immediately had my eyes on two things: the fried fish sandwich and the sushi that appeared to be so fresh. 

Unfortunately, I tried neither. The fried fish seasoning has MSG in it. Then I decided to just do sushi. Well the guy who was preparing it was also collecting money. Needless to say, he did rinse his hands under water... Smh. Sir, you have to use soap and water then rinse for at least 20 seconds!

Nonetheless, I'm still giving this place three stars, because my mother-in-law enjoyed her fish. I hope she enjoyed that headache too from the MSG!! But whatever makes her happy deserves at least three stars :)"}
{"text":"If you want fresh fish staring you in the eyeball, this is the place for you! We walked in and were immediately greeted by tons of different fish packed on ice and waiting to go. Our tour guide told us the history of Wholey's and you can see how far they've come. The \"rules\" posted outside of the store added a nice touch and the store is very kid friendly."}
{"text":"I mean, it's fishy, like real fishy in here.  Not in the suspicious way...but in the way where the smell of fish engulfs you as soon as you hit the door!  You're coming here because you're serious about fish!

But not only will you find fresh fish here, but you'll also find really cheap fresh produce too!  I feel like that's a little known fact.  It may be a challenge if you're just going for the cheap produce and can't stand the smell of fish though...so bring the nose plugs.  

I love coming here in the summer when I want to grill out.  I stop in for the fresh tuna steak and shrimp.  This is the place to go to get big portions and half the cost of Giant Eagle, and you know it's going to be good and worth it!  

On the off months it's nice to come in to grab a nice fishy lunch (hello fish sammie!) or stop in for sushi at Andy's Sushi Bar (see Andy's Sushi Bar review!).  Seriously, if you're a fish lover, you really must come in here!  You'll obviously be okay with the fish smell then...non-fish lovers beware.  Don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"Wholey's is one of my quintessential Pittsburgh landmarks. It's not only one of my favorite places to buy sushi grade fish and seafood and the occasional meat from their butcher dept; I  go to eat their famous fish sandwich and get some made to order sushi from Andy's sushi bar as well. There is a dining room upstairs with plenty of seating available. 

It is one of my go to spots to bring out of town visitors to get a great feel of Pittsburgh. Love love love this place and can't imagine giving it less than five stars."}
{"text":"The freshest seafood you're going to get in the Pittsburgh area! They have everything and more. Try their seafood mac or their crab dip! AMAZING! Prices aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I don't travel to Pittsburgh, so I have never sampled Wholey's in-store cooked food, but this is my go-to online seller of the most delicious Icelandic haddock for cooking at home, delivered to my door with much dry ice in only 2 days. This fish is frozen, but it tastes so much fresher than the fish I can buy at the seafood counter at the grocery store. It is the only fish my family will eat. Thanks, Wholey's!"}
{"text":"Wholey's has the best fish in the city; Wholefoods may have better presentation and cost more, but when you get it home and cook it and it's gamey you'll known what I mean. All the young people at Wholey's are courteous and helpful and Wholey's is a Pittsburgh institution that makes this city special. Please patronize and thank me later. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"If you've read my other reviews, you know that I almost never give anywhere 5 stars and almost never review any non-restaurant business.  The 2 rare exceptions to this rule are actually neighbors, Wholey's and the Asian Lotus Grocery next door to it.  Shop at both every chance you get.  Wholey's has ABSURD prices, $2 a pound boneless chicken breast, $5 a pound live maine lobster specials.  They have great meat, every fish imaginable, fresh produce, and awesome homemade fudge, peanut butter and candied popcorn.  They also have a in house sushi chef, and tasty fresh made sandwiches and appetizers.  It's not the shrink wrapped giant eagle experience where all the foods are hidden and sealed away.  If the smell or look of fresh seafood offends you, stay far, far away, Wholey's is like traveling back to a fish monger's market from days of yore.  Knowledgeable fish mongers debone massive freshly caught fish and massive slabs of salmon and shrimp are piled high on ice.  The food is out and about, straight off the boat and in many cases still swimming.  If you want great prices, and a huge selection of every kind of fresh fish and meat imaginable, dive into Wholeys!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm nostalgic for the burgh,but I've been to lot's of fish places from New Orleans,Monterrey,to the San Francisco bay and this just does something the others can't do for me.

It just feels like home. 

Great gumbo's,fish fries and seafood."}
{"text":"So other than the fantastic fish market (including live fish!) - they have these soft shell crab sandwiches that are ridiculously cheap ($5), fresh, and TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! other fish sandwiches are good too, but the soft shell crab sandwich is REALLY good. i like to eat it with some malt vinegar. 

delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the Burgh, Bits, and Bites tour.  We met the owner Robert Wholey, who told a really unsavory racist joke.  I was not happy.  Being a born and bred Pittsburgh native I was embarrassed people like him still exist.  Needless to say I won't ever be going back.  I noticed several other people on yelp have already commented on this, so obviously this wasn't the first time, nor the last."}
{"text":"A visit to Pittsburgh is not complete without stopping to get a fish sandwich at wholey's.  for $6.00 you get a cod sandwich with 2 large batter dipped, deep fried, hot, crispy filets.  I also get a side of smelts and an order of clam strips instead of fries.  Top it off with a glass (now plastic bottle - times change) of buttermilk and you have a real Pittsburgh tradition - well, maybe it's just MY Pittsburgh tradition, but it never disappoints.

For the life of me, I cant figure out why people go to primanti's for a flavorless starch sandwich when they can get one of the best fish sandwiches on the planet!

The market is fun too.  They have an impressive selection of fish and meats.  Not super fancy, but out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"love this place! How can you go wrong!? I miss it so much when I go to Maryland and it's funny how you can't find decent fish in other states. MUST TRY! The food section, sushi, and very good rotisserie chicken! Great Selection! Closes early! So get there early!"}
{"text":"Robert Wholey's most popular attraction seems to be the hot food inside of the store. Unfortunately, since there was a long line, I was short on time and stomach space, I didn't get a chance to try any of the seafood sandwiched I read such good things about.

Instead, I tried the lobster rolls they were selling outside. For $7, it was really good for the price. They don't skimp on the lobster meat either. They use big chunks of lobster (including whole pieces of claw meat), which was most likely previously frozen, but it still tasted pretty good. The thing is that it's not that sanitary. The guy making the sammies did change his gloves right after we ordered the roll. But then he handled the cash we gave him, and THEN he grabbed the bread with the same hand! I'm not trying to be a germaphobe here but um...what was the point of changing that glove then?! 

So if you're willing to turn the other cheek, you'll get a decent lobster roll. It won't be very clean but then again, what food bought on the street is?"}
{"text":"One of my colleagues told me about this place three years back. Since then, we regularly go there for fish and chicken. I would like to specially mention about the Cajun spiced cat fish and salmon. They marinate the fish with spices already and sell from the counter. It is the best fish I ever had. I would recommend this to those who like their fish spicy!"}
