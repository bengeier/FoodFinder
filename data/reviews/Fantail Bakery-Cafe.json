{"text":"This is a gem on the west side of the city. 

On a saturday afternoon, Fantail is not overcrowded and noisy (unlike many many coffee shops in the city on a weekend).  Their bakery selection is extremely tempting- with offerings like carrot cake, their best selling muffin to an epic looking brioche bun that looks like it exploded out of a muffin tin.  

Unfortunately since I had already had a large lunch at La Cubana, I only ordered a cappuccino with almond milk.   The service was extremely friendly and on paying they have a little game where if you roll the die at the cashier and get double 6's the coffee is free of charge! (you can all guess what happened on my throw) 

Fantail truly embodies what I love about cafe and coffee culture ; good coffee and excellent baked goods in an atmosphere where you can truly relax away from the crowds and hustle and bustle of the city."}
{"text":"I love this place. 
I dropped in the other day to do some work and managed to find a table. I just wanted tea, but between the two of us, we ended up getting FOUR TREATS! they were delicious.

I'm so happy that this coffee shop opened in this area because:
- real great baked goods which is rare on this street.  While a small part of me may agree with some reviewers about the price, I have no issues paying them. The baked goods are worth it and different - and far more superior than any other establishment in the west end - and the prices are not that uncommon to what you see nowadays.
- something about the layout of this place works. I think because the cashier is off to the back and the traffic is off to the side; so if you are working, you are not constantly interrupted by baby carriages bumping into you or the espresso machine going off every two seconds. 
- the crowd is not the typical roncey uptight - let's stare at each other crowd. It's incredibly casual and relaxed. Everything from the furniture to the tableware are just lovely and not too contrived. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"Their food and baked goods selection aren't as diverse or numerous than Mabel's a little more down the street, but the advantage they have is that this is a great cafe to sit down and spend time doing cafe things. Maybe I saw wrong, but I only saw two tables at Mabel's, while this place has a big, open, bright seating area. Their drip coffee is very close to water :( but their baked goods and seating is good."}
{"text":"This is the best bakery on Roncesvalles, but it's got the worst customer service of pretty much any space I've ever been. 

I walk by here every single morning. I used to go in every day and get something (usually the frittata muffin and a bag or two of day-olds--always spending between $11 and $18), but over time, the service was so dreadful, that now I have to stand out front and question whether I want to bother. Seven out of ten times, when I do go in, I leave empty-handed and frustrated, just like I did today. The service is truly that dreadful. 

Today, there was a woman being served (a guy was making her coffee) and another woman who entered ahead of me was having a conversation with a staff member that I only caught the tail-end of (about maybe a cake being baked and what she wanted it to look like and what time to pick it up). My first thought was, \"Great! Two staff members. This should go smoothly.\"

The cake conversation finished and I stepped forward to be served. Without acknowledging my presence, that staff member turned and walked into the back room. Then, the coffee maker handed the coffee to his customer and promptly left the service area and went downstairs, again, neither acknowledging my presence or bothering to thank the coffee buyer. 

Us two customers looked at one another and exchanged a \"wtf?\", and I silently walked out like I've done so many times before. However, today was the last time. I won't be going back in. 

As someone who worked customer service for 35 years before retiring, I am stunned that this place is so oblivious to how awful they treat their customers. Had I been properly served from the git-go, at minimum they'd be making almost $3500 a year from me alone. (6 days a week x $11-18). That's a nice chunk towards a month's rent. From one customer! 

Please note: I am not a rude or even vocal person. I've never complained about their service inside the space. I always say please and thank you and ask staff how they're doing (when I actually make it to the order stage)--a product of having worked in customer service for more than 3 decades. Just noting this in case you think I'm some hated person who makes a stink in there every time I'm in, thereby justifying their behavior. That's not the case.

Anyway, tl;dr? Avoid this place. Mabel's down the street isn't nearly as good but it's perfectly decent for a morning snack when you're in a hurry. And the staff there know how to treat a customer."}
{"text":"Cool music, friendly staffs, awesome bakery! Had a croissant and a carrot cake. Love the atmosphere in there :D"}
{"text":"Welcome to Fantail, a brand new family owned and operated business in Roncesvalles :)  

Jarra and Michelle are siblings, and Holly is their first cousin. All three of these New Zealanders have artistic backgrounds. Jarra does fine woodworking and is responsible for the beautiful wood tables you see in the café. Holly, a painter and illustrator, and Michelle, a fashion designer, have been able to showcase their artistic talents by designing and creating the entire interior of the café. It isn't just the food that is well crafted!

The prequel to Fantail was Holly and Michelle's baking business called Bakeress. The focus of Fantail is the same as Bakeress, quality ingredients that taste as good as they look, but they decided to add a savoury element. You will find organic, vegan, and gluten free options, plus direct trade coffee.

I had the savoury muffin which was one of their best sellers of the day. It had a subtle spicy kick to it, a great way to start the day!

If you follow them on Facebook, you get a sneak peak of what is being prepped for the next day. I want to go back today for a banana caramel filled donut!   

Don't forget about the baristas, Grace and Max, who are also from New Zealand."}
{"text":"We are very fortunate to have Fantail on our neighbourhood!
Really wonderful folks running the place.
Fantastic selection of treats and sweets and great value for the quality of the house made products."}
{"text":"Dear Fantail, I loved your pumpkin-cinnamon brioche. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate and crave it. I can still remember the icing sugar and the touch of pumpkin puree on top of the freshly baked-just-out-of-the-oven brioche and the discovery of pumpkin-cinnamon in the middle, mmm.  I also loved your just right amount of butter, raspberry scone so in my book, you are my current favourite bakery cafe. I also appreciated that you were clean, the music was nice, at perfect volume hence not intrusive, big enough space for gathering, tastefully decorated, clean washroom and offered self-serve water and organic milk for the coffee."}
{"text":"Came here the other week with a colleague. Such a cute little cafe with so many different kinds of pastries and drinks to choose from. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a good coffee."}
{"text":"Nice little bakery.  Came a little late so most of there pastry were gone.  Ended up with the Cinnamon Brioche.  I wanted to try the pumpkin-cinnamon brioche that everyone is raving about. :(  The Cinnamon Brioche is a souped up version of Cinnabon.  I loved it.  Atmosphere is awesome as well. Will be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Just another ordinary cafe. Super overpriced... $3.50 for a small muffin? Really??
Ambiance not warm... cool... if you like that for a cafe... I don't.

Plus: they have organic and gluten free food. Love that.. but why does healthy have to be sooooo over priced???
Really hard for those of us living paycheck to paycheck + have health issues. SIGH!

To the owners...if you really care about food and people. Please do better with pricing. Thanks."}
{"text":"Nice cafe here on roncey strip! Coffee had great flavour and the sandwich was very yum! They said      They usually do a daily sandwich which that day was very good! Only thing not much variety but what they did that day was great! 3.5 stars really.
Staff was very friendly and it was a nice time. Seating is very limited so it may be hard to find seating  but it is worth it"}
{"text":"Came here because it was near a place I was visiting a friend. Lately with the super hot weather, I wanted a nice cold drink so I ordered the iced latte with almond milk. The espresso itself has great fruity notes and it wasn't bitter nor sour which I liked a lot. Customer service however was very meh. The iced drink wasn't even full, near 3 quarters of the cup and I spent ~$5 on this drink. Great espresso though."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a treat - everything's amazing especially the brioche, croissants and salads. A little pricey for some, but makes for a special visit."}
{"text":"The baked goods are excellent.  The cafe looks great and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Almond raspberry baked good ok. With flat white over 10 bucks?! 
Too expensive, plus every coffee shop must pay a terrible wage, constant TIP requests."}
{"text":"FAVOURITE CAFE IN THE CITY!!

I have been going to Fantail for years now and I can honestly say that it is the cutest little spot in Toronto. Their food is great, the customer service is even better, and their location is in the heart of Roncesvalles. 

They don't offer any public wifi, however, this totally adds to their vibe and fuels real interactions with customers and workers.

10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Discovered this cafe when exploring the area. it's small with limited seating but well worth the effort. The decor is very eclectic and you notice that the owners pay attention to the details since it is very clean, service is great and the food/drinks are out of this world. If you are a vegetarian or vegan they have some good options. 

Their coffee is great quality and their pastries are out of this world, not to mention their sandwiches, I love them to bits. It's a great place to come with your family, hang out, and relax."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe (also super hipster) with fresh baked goods and coffee! Super cute and bright space. 

The chocolate croissants are some of the best on the strip (which is saying something because there are so many bakeries and cafes on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop. Slightly pricier then I would like. I do love the baked goods here and would return if I was around"}
{"text":"Finally made it in, as I've been meaning to since day 1. I had a brew coffee, which has a nice palette. The treats all looked delicious. I tried out the dark chocolate and peach brioche, and it was fantastic! 

The interior is also stunning. It's a very warm, comfortable atmosphere that is glamorous, but not pretentious. Beautiful woodwork, which I understand was the work of one of the owners. 

A little bit pricey, but definitely worth it. I'm already planning coffee dates here for the coming weeks. Fantail is a welcome addition to the Roncesvalles village!"}
{"text":"There is something so genuine and authentic about this place that keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great food, decor and good, friendly service. I enjoyed the Thai rice salad, raspberry almond tart and flat white."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their strawberry vanilla scone. It was AMAZING! Not only was it nice and flakey, but it was also the perfect amount of sweetness. I prefer my scones to be less on the sweet side and this one was it. The strawberrg flavour was quite distinct and the hint of vanilla just made the scone all the more delicious. I wish I could have tried more baked goods but the scone itself was quite hefty. The only thing the could have improved the scone would be if it was warm. I will definitely be back to try the hot chocolate as well."}
{"text":"Baked goods are on point (cinnamon croissant thing is amazing!), the cafe is bright and pleasant, though the staff could make more of an effort to clean the tables a little more frequently.

I like the bar stools by the window - great for people watching on Roncy!

I give this place 3 stars because their espresso-based drinks have missed the mark every single time I've stopped by.  Yes they do almond milk and have a bunch of sizes, but if an espresso can't be pulled properly, all the rest of it is moot."}
{"text":"How happy am I to come across this hidden gem!!  Im more of a savoury pastry gal and this place have a plentitude of options that are delicious!   Im so happy finding this place and will come again soon..maybe tmrw!  Yum !  I tried the pesto tomato cheese muffin bread like thing that was sinfully satisfying.  Thank you for representing the savoury side of things!"}
