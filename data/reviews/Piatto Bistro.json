{"text":"Always enjoy piatto, best Italian in Mississauga, very friendly and attentive service, coupled with proper Italian food.  

I prefer ordering from the specials board, and generally need to make reservations on weekend evenings. Always a solid bet when you are entertaining people from out of town who aren't into going downtown. I prefer the veal chop and pasta with mushrooms and truffle."}
{"text":"Great food here. My bf and I celebrated our 1st year anniversary here. My favourite restaurant in Mississauga so far."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Mississauga. Tom and the team are outstanding as is the food, the wine and the ambience. Tom makes my favourite pasta dish. I give it a 5."}
{"text":"i have been coming here for many, many years, fantastic food, especially when the chalk board specials come out.  Italian at it's finest, superb, simple and elegant.  the food is always consistently excellent.  it does come at a price, but the atmosphere and ambiance does it justice.  very professional wait staff, always on the ball keeping your glasses topped up, attentive to the smaller details.  just ate their recently at the beginning of the month, had the salmon and soup this time from the specials board, full of flavour, salmon was delicate and just melted in my mouth.  could do with an update, perhaps a little more modern touch as it's getting to be a little dated.  always an older crowd that goes and time to bring in some younger blood.  my parents adore this place, and it's the one reason i go, since it's always with them."}
{"text":"I wanted to take 2 friends out to dinner at a nice place they would love - they picked thier local favorite, Piatto. A nice mid-sized upscale dining experience in Mississauga.
 
The dishes were grounded in Italian and Spanish roots, with some interesting variations; nothing too crazy as the highlight seemed to be 'mushroom week'; apparently the staff is quited involved in the local shroom foraging.

Quality of the food to price was good, fresh veal scallopini with morels came in under 30, my buddy had the mushroom-centric prix fixe, which was stellar from end to end -they even had a semi-sweet mushroom/fruit compote for desert with the prix fixe, and it was a hit. 

The paritcular experience was a 3.5, due to a seeming rush to clear plates, followed by a 30 minute wait for the check over a bare table. The attention to detail in all dishes, and the tiramisu (I face dived on the plate) bring it up to a solid 4."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Italian fare is truly the best. The service is impeccable, owner still comes to each table too greet all customers. Penne and Chicken Supreme in the oyster mushroom cream sauce is my new addiction. Magnifique"}
{"text":"Superb food, warm and friendly atmosphere, white table cloth and attentive service, a place where you won't be rushed and the waiters say thank you when they place the napkin on your lap. Add to that great quality and innovative assortment of dishes at a reasonable price. The menu choices were so good we had a hard time deciding what to choose. We ended up with two appetizers, fried calamari with ailoli sauce from the regular menu and and house made pate from the blackboard menu. Both were exquisite and aioli sauce the best I ever tasted. Next came Coquilles Saint-Jacques which was out of this world, full of scallops and shrimp in the most delicious creamy sauce, rimmed with mashed potatoes. It was a true seafood delight and so filling we'd decided to skip desert...that is until the waiter mentioned panna cotta, an Italian custard. As everything else, it was delicious. If you haven't tried Piatto yet, you are missing out on the best food in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"An amazing place where time seems to stop. The food was as authentic Italian as it gets. The old style architecture made the place seem mesmerizing. 

I went there on a date with my girlfriend on a Friday evening and yet it didn't seem crowded.  The place was a bit difficult to find due to the construction right next to it.  But once there I had no complains. 

We ordered Calamari, shrimp risotto , mango cheesecake and an ice cream thing (with a difficult name) . Everything was delicious. Our server Greg was really polite and helpful. 

The ambience was rustic and quiet. The place is meant for a romantic date. Family dinner is also something you can consider this place for.

I plan to go there as long as the building stands. 
Needless to say I really recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, this is really a hidden gem. Great food, very careful waiters, all in all excellent service. Quiet and elegant but not very expensive. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. From start to finish, from the initial greeting, the food, the wine. . .  I had veal medallions in a mushroom cream sauce - fabulous.  Husband ordered the veal chop.   Both cooked to perfection, lovely presentation and excellent wine list.  Go!"}
{"text":"I consider this more of a \"special occasion\" place in Mississauga. The staff are really wonderful - exceptional service, and owner Tom treats guests like royalty. Food is always executed beautifully, and reflects the Italian background and the chef's Spanish roots.
They have a delicious salad I always order - I think it has pear and goat cheese? They have a good wine selection as well. There is a blackboard daily special as well, and they're always great.
I would definitely recommend it for a nice cozy romantic dinner, a spot to entertain some clients, or to take your hard-to-please foodie friends - they'd all be impressed and enjoy their evening."}
{"text":"When I looked for a nice restaurant to have dinner with my family celebrating my daughter's birthday I didn't know that this place will be over and above our expectations.. and I regret that I haven't been to this place before... 
From layout, to lighting, music everything is great, then came the food... so delicious and fresh, excellent quality, and on top of all is the service, very warm, professional and courteous.
Definitely this place deserves to be the best in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased because I've been going here since I was a kid and know most of the people that work there by name (and vice versa) but I have to say the quality is always good, the dishes are simple but delicious, and MAKE SURE you get the chocolate pate. great for a first date, a tenth date, a birthday, an anniversary..."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by chance and have been back 3 times Based on the sole fact that the customer service here is fantastic! They remember who I am each time I come what my wine preference is and we always leave with a little piece of chocolate. It's the little things. **Also, they make a great seafood linguini!"}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated New Year's eve at this restaurant dining on their 5 course special dinner. It was my first time there, though my parents frequent the restaurant. 

First impressions, its got kind of an old school feel with a less than modern looking interior. Not a bad thing, just different from the restaurants that I usually frequent. I suppose they noticed that when my boyfriend and I walked in. The all male serving staff sort of gawked for awhile rather than helping us.

The food was quite good, with the bison main course and panna cotta dessert being the yummiest. 
I would suggest this restaurant if you were looking for a quiet date night and are willing to spend moderate amounts of money."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming here because I thought it would be too upscale but everyone makes you feel right at home.  The service was exceptional from the moment we walked into the restaurant, these guys know how to do it right.  The host even hung up our coats. The food was also excellent.  We shared the caprese salad and lobster and fish cakes.  Both very good.  My mom and sister had the fettuccine with lobster and brandy sauce.  The portion was very big and there was so much lobster meat.  I had the chicken with almonds and amaretto cream.  The flavours were unique and worked really well with each other.  They also offered complimentary bread and butter which so many restaurants don't do anymore.  

We had mentioned it was my mom's birthday when we came in and throughout the evening she received numerous wishes, it was very thoughtful.  They surprised her (and us) with a complimentary slice of cheesecake.  It was mango flavoured and so good!  The reason why I didn't give 5 stars was the creme brulee.  It's my favourite dessert and I order it at every restaurant which offers it.  The custard was grainy and very eggy.  Our spoons smelled like eggs just after a couple of spoons of the dessert.  I don't think they put any or enough vanilla.  Other than that everything else was exceptional!  I would definitely go back and just steer clear of the creme brulee."}
{"text":"Nice environment, decent food. We ordered the Piatto veal dish and the lobster mozzarella pasta, both are perfect."}
{"text":"What a nice and cozy place.

The bread could've been warm... just felt it was cold...

Great place for a date night"}
