{"text":"Hmm for my first review i think I'll tell yelp about a new bao place I've taken a liking to: Tiffany cafe.

The name \"caf√©\" is a bit misleading cuz it's a bao place. It's never very crowded and at 2.99 for a beef bao, the Price is definitely amazing.

Delicious too. I've tried both the grilled chicken and the beef, and the grilled chicken is definitely my favorite, but the 2.99 grand opening special only applies to the beef I think!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Tiffany Cafe for lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised to see a lunch special of bao, a side and a drink for under $7.  I got the vegetable bao with a side of the carrot soup, and my dining partner got the chicken bao with soup.  We both loved our dishes; the carrot soup was nice and carrot-y without being too rich and creamy.  The vegetable bao had a delicious vegetable croquette which was hot from the fryer, deliciously crisp but still light, together with some greens, fresh avocado and a nice aioli.  The chicken bao was a hit too.  We had a great meal for under $13 for both of us - definitely a steal in downtown Toronto.  Plus the staff was super nice and friendly.  We'll definitely be back - we also noticed a few heartier dishes such as pastas and actual sandwiches we wanted to try."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to judge this place because I'm not a big \"fusion\" bao fan anymore, ever since it became \"trendy\".  I don't like being trendy. I'd rather be the outcast.  

Regardless, here's what I think:

Ambiance/decor: very peaceful, nicely decorated and seems like a great place to catch up with friends and/or study.  Friendly owner.  

Food:  I had the combo for 5.99 which included a beef short rib bao, roasted red pepper soup and a pop.  I found the bao to be okay with a mixture of tang/pickle-ness and sweet beef.  However, for me, the taste didn't blow me away.  Maybe it's because I thought it was small and was expecting to be blown away, but I wasn't. It was okay, 2.5/5.  As for the roasted red pepper soup, this was absolutely delicious.  You could taste all the veggies.  4/5.  

Verdict: I think this is a decent place if you are a small eater or want something different or a snack, but for many, this would not be enough to be considered a full meal.  I'd still visit again for a short break though. 3/5."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time, with a friend. It's a new place and we decided to give it a shot. The service was very good and the employees were very friendly. 

We each got the bao special ($5.99), both choosing the pulled pork. Honestly I didn't think it was anything special. It was fairly small and tasted decent, but maybe I expected more flavour. It all tasted fresh which is good, but I wish it was bigger or had more to it.

I got fries as my side. You get a small portion of basic fries. Not seasoned, not spicy, not battered. Just generic french fries, and only like 10-12 of them.

My friend got the carrot ginger soup as his side. He said it was very good, but the portion was a bit small. The presentation was very nice, though.

I liked the cucumber water they have by the register. It's refreshing on a hot day. I liked it more than the Nestea I got with the meal.

Nothing in the downtown core is cheap, so we figured $5.99 was a steal for a combo... but given the portion, in my opinion, it was more of a sampler than anything else. I ended up eating again not long afterwards.

The presentation and design was top notch, and they could not have been more accommodating. I applaud them for that. However, given that I go out to eat for the food, I personally would not return. While maybe more greasy and with less \"atmosphere\", I can still find places to eat uptown for the same price that offer 2 to 3 times the quantity of food.

This type of fusion food is not for everyone, of course. But if you want something that seems more up-scale without a huge price tag, Tiffany Cafe will satisfy you. There's a good chance you'll find the atmosphere and customer service very pleasing. But if you want to be full, you'll need to order a lot more, so just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This place has lots of potential and is hidden on yonge St. This location is small and very limited seating. The menu is pretty straight forward they had a special offer combo of bao of choice, soup or fries and a pop for $5.99. We ordered the pulled pork and chicken with carrot soups. The cucumber water in front cashier is very refreshing especially on a hot day. The seating was OK. Wait time is about 10-15 minutes the carrot soup was nothing to write home about maybe it's my taste buds but I didn't taste any wows like other reviewers here did. The pulled pork bao itself apparently best seller was saturated in this maple sauce tasted saucy but there was no pop of  flavor. The bao size is nicely sized. The grilled chicken was pretty good better tasting than the pulled pork in my opinion. Overall we were satisfied with our meal. Unfortunately it didnt leave us with a wow we are coming back again as the pricing and bao combo did not fill us it was more of an overpriced snack that we we had which was OK but having dinner here you would need to order at least 3. They did have these fresh ice creams on fruit that we will come back and try."}
{"text":"I noticed a new cafe opening by my work area and they had a $2.99 Bao special, so I decided to give it a try.   Order the Short Rib Bao and it was delish!  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was light, not too heavy.  Also ordered the carrot ginger soup to go with it.   The soup was divine.   Not salty and starchy.  You can really taste the carrots in there.   A really nice addition to the neighborhood.   You can really each here often and not really feel a dent in your wallet.  So, definitely a great place to grab a quick lunch for all you office workers in the area.  I'll definitely have to come back to try other items on the menu ~ such as the short rib pasta."}
{"text":"Very good bao sandwiches. Portions are good sized but not huge ... but definitely very tasty. Service was excellent. Carrot soup was also great!"}
