{"text":"My family and I are traveling from Wyoming. We had been on the road for about 12 hours and my nephew suggested Mr. Mamas based off online reviews. Before we even got to the door the staff had us smiling! We were greeted outside the restaurant and immediately seated. Our server, Claudia, was very nice and the food was great. We were pretty hangry when we pulled into the parking lot but our meal was out in less than 10 minutes and the restaurant was nearly full! Great food, great service, great price, great experience!"}
{"text":"The staff are amazing and really make you feel like family!  Kat is extra special and has a huge heart of gold :)  If you are looking for amazing food at an even more amazing price this is the perfect spot.  Great portions and flavor is on point all the time.  It is tradition for us to make this our trip home breakfast spot every time we are in Vegas!!!  The Rogel family loves Mr. Mamas!!!

{"text":"Cannot say enough about this place. While visiting from Chicago I found Mr. Mamas on yelp and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. I am so glad I did. The food was plentiful and by far the best breakfast my husband and I have had. He is a big guy and could not finish the turkey bacon and full stack of pancakes because the pancakes were so huge! I opted for the Cali omelette and 1 pancake (opted for this instead of toast). The owner even came out and spoke with us. This restaurant makes you feel like family. We made this our breakfast spot for our stay. Whenever we are in town they will have our business."}
{"text":"Breakfast was just awesome.  Pancakes were just right and the French toast were delicious and not soggy like other restaurants.  Bacon was crispy and not greasy. Price was on point for the food. Will definitely come back when visiting Vegas and recommend all to come."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas was simply fantastic. Tamra, our server, was awesome and made our visit wonderful. The food was delicious, the coffee was hot, and the french toast was to die for. The home fries, with bell peppers, onions, and cheese on top were so good! Definitely recommend them and Mr Mamas for your next breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place! Staff is very welcoming, which is rare to see nowadays. This is not my first time, but I haven't tried many things on their menu, but so far all was great. I do have to say we keep coming back for the service, it's nice to come to a place where you feel appreciated, and everyone has a smile on their face. We were greeted by the owner and he held the doors open for everyone. Great vibe overall. The only thing that I'm not so crazy about is the ceiling fans. For how hot it is in Vegas, it felt a bit warm inside, and the thought of the dust that might be collecting on the fans, that then was flying around was unpleasant. But needless to say, we'll be back more and more. Thank you for your great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. The service is amazing and the food is delicious. I had the California omelet and I was blown away with how nice the employees were. Definitely going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Was great the feeling is very welcoming and the food is great worth venturing off from the strip to head out this way. The guy that greets you is cool as hell and makes you feel like your in the right spot ."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I decided to go out for a late breakfast.. And let alone it's hard finding somewhere other than Denny's or IHOP that serve breakfast into the day time.. but as I sit here and drink my tea, I can't help but leave a little review.. Apparently it's their first day opening here at their new location.. (Which we we went to the location on this yelp site first, and when we got to the correct spot they gave us a free coffee for the  inconvenience) but the wait wasn't too bad.. We got service right away.. The parking was excellent and easy. And our server is amazing! This place is hands down the best breakfast spot in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Friendly, caring service.  The team makes you feel at home.  The food excellent!  My husband and I are addicted to their fluffy pancakes and their Cali omelet scrambled.  The home fries with peppers and onions YUM!  if you want great food, awesome service at a fair price check out Mr. Mama's.  Breakfast or lunch this is the place!  You too will be a raving fan."}
{"text":"Just a good as allllll the reviews said it was! Great portions, quick service and yummy breakfast standbys PLUS (my guys fave) delicious stuffed burritos! Couldn't have been happier walking out of this apparently iconic way to start so many people's days!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for breakfast.  The atmosphere was very friendly.  Sean (sp?) greeted us at the door and was very friendly.  As we walked in, we immediately noticed the busy, bustling staff.  They were very friendly and very helpful. 

The food was amazing.  I had the Mamas Stack of 3 pancakes.  They came out on a plate and look like a cake!  I requested poached eggs.  Not only were the eggs correctly poached, but they were not all wet.   My wife had the steak and eggs, and it was excellent as well.

P.S. Kudos to Mr Mamas for offering turkey bacon."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Amazing service, food, and prices! My friends and I loved everything about this place. Our only grief is that we didn't discover this place sooner! We for sure have a go-to spot for delicious breakfast and lunch when we visit Las Vegas again. We loved it so much, we visited two days in a row. Do yourself a favor and visit this warm, friendly place with awesome food!"}
{"text":"Place was packed which is a good sign. Food was good, fresh and service was great. Had pancakes, bacon and eggs. Cooked perfectly and the bacon was awesome. The owner took the time to come over and greet us personally. You can tell he really enjoys his work and is a great guy."}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service - pair that with the great foods and it's a must breakfast spot! 

As a business owner I was truly impressed with the over-the-top friendly atmosphere and helpful staff here. It made me feel like I was in a 5-star fine-dining restaurant- really that good! Loved the food, loved the service, A+++!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had period!!!  Arrived on a Sunday morning with a group of 7 and was seated within 30 minutes.  The staff was curious and prompt.  Mary the manager stopped to check on us and Shawn kept us laughing!! He even offered to take a pic of our group.  Lourdes our waitress was sweet and accommodating!!  By far the best experience I've had in Vegas.  Mr. Mama's is must!! If you miss it you miss out."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing. There breakfast was beyond our expectations and the customer service was exceptional! The owner has a great sense of humor. I truly felt like I was home. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So very good! I loved my omelet and they even offer french vanilla creamer. Service was top notch too!"}
{"text":"I ate there today for the first time. We were greeted by the owner and seated right away! The servers are friendly and efficient. The food was fresh and cooked exactly the way we ordered it! It came quick and was still hot. The pancakes are delicious and are as big as the plates they are served on. Coffee was great and the sausage tastes homemade. My friend dropped her credit card on the floor and the owner. Brought it out to the car!  I love this place and will be going back for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I've been here multiple times and have always experienced wonderful service and great tasting meals. Come here with an appetite because the meals are large!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get the same thing the chicken fried steak which is truly amazing and by that I mean huge I typically have left overs but waaaiiiit there's more it microwaves well like I'm talkin still crispy but anywho the service is a meh but I don't care the owner is always there and very kind screw the servers just don't tip them if they wanna be a butthole not my problem more money in my pockets."}
{"text":"Have been to the restaurant several times and will continue to go back. Location is easy to get to, staff is very friendly, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was so great and I can't believe how cheap it was. I got the french toast and it was super good. The store was crowded but that just proves how good this place is. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"The breakfast is standard fare. We've frequented the old and new location. Catchy name, consistent breakfast, local restaurant.  My current visit resulted in a visit from the owner inquiring how we found Mr. Mama's. Apparently Yelp is a big contributor to the success. I'd just be comfortable dining in peace. Reliable 3 egg omelets, coffee is mediocre. I wouldn't make a special trip if your not in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Total hype. all cisco brand food typical. Owner is rude staff very rude. I will never go there kitchen really dirty you must see for yourself. Word is owner pays customers t write positive yelp postings. The whole place is a scam. People are being scammed."}
{"text":"Cute little place, weird location though. 

The host seemed very annoyed that we were missing a couple people from our group of 6 (they ended up showing up 10 minutes after we sat down).

The food was cooked well, but very bland. Hash browns were crispy but no flavor, pancakes/French toast/country fried steak were all ordinary and not special.

Will probably eat here again and try something else on the menu that's \"home made\" or a specialty of the restaurant. And, I'll be sure the whole party is there before we check in"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast spot! Everything was fantastic. Hashbrowns were perfectly crispy, bacon was cooked just right! Biscuits and gravy were out of this world!! Going back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast restaurant all around. Customer service, timeless, atmosphere, food all highest marks. My  family was traveling through and was looking for a good place to have breakfast and found the best. No wait. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was an A+ family restaurant. The owner actually took time out and introduced himself. The staff was great. Hold up...... The food was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"How can one go fifty-one years without ever trying  Eggs Benedict? Well, I did it but I took care that a few moments ago. Mr.Mamas hooked me up with some delicious eggs benedict that will ensure that dish a regular spot in my breakfast rotation. 

I also had the hash browns and biscuits & Gravy. The hash browns were cooked to crispy perfection. The gravy was a little sweet for my taste but when I ordered they made it a point to say they use maple syrup in it. 

Mr. Mama greets you at the door with a smile & the entire staff follows his lead by being attentive and friendly. Anytime I'm in Vegas this will be my \"go to\" breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Had breakfast and selected the gyro -special of the day and French toast it was alright not great but not bad. The staff we're very nice, but the food lacked that great unique taste that make you want to tell youre friends to go check it out."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas! Try the ham and French toast! And stay for the Reuben (get it Mamas style)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! New location and still the best customer service. Everyone is so nice and the food is great. I'm pretty picky about my breakfast and this place never disappoints. And if you don't know what you want...just ask. They are the best at giving really good recommendations based on what you like."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly service, great food and family friendly. I can only review the breakdast as we have yet to stop in for lunch. Everything tastes super fresh. The chicken fried steak breakfast is hearty and not overly salted like most places. It is tipped with a delicious country gravy made with maple syrup, sausage and bacon. Delicious! The omelets are fluffy and loaded with fresh and tasty fillings. I love the hashbrowns. They are perfect, crispy without being dry. The pancakes are huge, fluffy and filling. My toddler is content with just one and the price is just right. The menu isn't fancy just full of good comfort food that doesn't weigh you down for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas from Atlanta, Ga on 9/11..! Let's just say this is the only day I've cleaned my plate and we've eaten at a couple 5 star restaurants...! Steak, eggs, slice of French toast, & a side of grits = several plates of heaven  my partner had the same..! Might I add I am a very picky eater..! Last but not least the staff was very warm inviting and courteous we will definitely be back..! They get all 10's across the board..!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here four out of six mornings while visiting the area. We tried several breakfast dishes and if I lived in Vegas this would our regular spot. The service was great! They get busy, so get there early or be patient. The eggs benedict is one of the best Ive had. We took a cinnamon roll to go for late snack and it was the real deal, like my Grandmas. The owner was very pleasant and you could tell he cared about his business and his employees."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were at the tail end of our 5 days in Las Vegas and were mere hours away from having to depart for the airport. Tired of the overpriced, crowded, and often underwhelming Vegas food options on The Strip (near the Flamingo), we sought out something different. After only one google search we chose Mr. Mamas based on its high reviews and we could not have made a better choice.

After a 25 minute Uber ride in traffic we arrived at Mr. Mamas and were sat immediately (however we did hear that they get quite busy so I guess Monday at 1pm was our lucky time). We both ordered the Chicken Fired Steak and Eggs. Everything was amazing and for about $10 per meal the $15 Uber ride basically paid for itself...since our other options were expensive buffets or pricey breakfast locations with insane waiting times. The gravy is even made in house! Delicious.

The staff were some of the nicest people we met the entire time. Multiple people greeted us, asked how our meal was, and had great conversation and service.

This was the perfect end to our trip and made our 8 hour delayed flight worth every hour. If you are looking for more \"affordable\" food with friendly staff and amazing breakfast/lunch then Mr. Mamas is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. New location, same great food and service with more seats. Mr. Mamas is a great spot for some family time and breakfast. They always make is feel welcome and important, they recognize my daughter everytime we come in and are supper sweet to her and know her by name. The cinnamon buns are awesome to share and the chili is the best. The new location is awesome, more seating and in a much more convenient location. Better parking and a nice floor layout, better than the old location. I love to support mom and pop shops and small businesses, the owner is very involved and meets with and talks to the costomers to ensure that your experience is good."}
{"text":"Wow, I can see why they have a ton of 5-star reviews. Fast and very friendly service and great food. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Sehr nette Bedienung und ein schneller Service. Frühstück war super lecker. Große Portionen und ein angenehmes Flair. Es war fast jeder Tisch besetzt :-) Spricht für sich!
Preislich i. O."}
{"text":"From the warm welcome as we entered, to the cheerful and prompt service, to the delicious and filling food, Mr. Mama's delivers an outstanding dining experience."}
{"text":"'Must go' stop in Vegas!  Greeted relight at we walked in the door.  Super friendly staff.  Husband ordered Corn Beef Hash, says 'it's excellent!\".  Pancakes are bigger than the plate and home made.  My Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs was amazing and more than I could eat, coffee was always full and hot.  Great place overall!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's one of my daughter's favorites. The staff is so sweet and friendly. Their iced coffee is delicious, as are their cinnamon rolls. I've always had a great experience here."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the big deal is here. We tried this place out for breakfast because of all the great reviews. We were a party of four and we all ordered something different. No one was particularly impressed with their meal. It's not that anything tasted bad but nothing was great either. Might as well just go to IHOP for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My husband and I were visiting Vegas and Heard about it from a local. The 5 star reviews is well earned. Friendly staff and great food. It felt like home."}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting Vegas for the first time from Nashville, TN, and we couldn't be more pleased that we stumbled upon this place early in our trip. We've been to Mr. Mama's for breakfast 3 times during our 8 day visit, and hope to hit it one more time before we leave! There are 7 of us in our group, and not one of us has had anything but the best at Mr. Mama's. Fantastic service and delicious food! We're thinking of scheduling another vacation to Las Vegas, just so we can eat here again! Thanks for making us feel like family, Mr. Mama's!"}
{"text":"Waitresses do not help each other and we were waiting a long time to have our waitress take our order. When she did come around to take our order we were told that she had been on the bathroom a long time. we asked to be seated at another table and her response was \"that's not my table\" so she couldn't be bothered to ask someone to clean it up for us."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends on one of their recommendations. I really wanted to like this place because breakfast is my favorite meal and Mr. Mamas is pretty close to me. 

I had the California Omelet, which I turned into a \"scramble\" because I'm weird. It was pretty standard: scrambled eggs, some pico, some avocado, and cheese (I left out the sausage). The meal came with hash browns and toast. Also adopted a couple bites of a pancake along the way from the plate next to mine. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't very memorable. Then again, my order was about as plain as possible, so maybe that was my fault. 

The service was amazing though. There were more staff then customers when we walked in, and that held true until we left. I'm always impressed when owners/managers aren't afraid to overstaff, and it really makes a difference in the level of hospitality and the overall feeling of the place. Every single employee, including who I believe was the owner, was constantly looking around for a way to serve the customers. If I looked up from my plate or my conversation, someone would immediately walk over to see if I needed anything. They even asked if we wanted our picture taken.

Overall, a good experience. Prices were definitely reasonable, and the location had ample parking. I will be back to see if my next order matches the great service."}
{"text":"First time customer. I was in town for CES, and I like mom and pop restaurants. This establishment delivers! Exactly what a mom and pop eatery should be. Very friendly, owner walks around and talks to customers to make sure everything is ok. Dishes like corned beef hash, pancakes, are totally homemade. The OJ is simply to die for!  Excellent flavor, large helpings, friendly service. Do yourself a favor, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, servers were all super friendly and always checking up on us plus making sure our drinks were full. The owner greets all the customers walking in so that surely makes us customers feel welcome. 

I ordered the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs which was outstanding, loved it !! I couldn't finish the whole dish so took the remainder to go.

Would I come back, definitely if I'm in town !!!"}
{"text":"Great attention to service. My wife and I were greeted immediately upon walking in by a host and various servers. I ordered the eggs with corn beef hash and it was delicious. You can tell everything was fresh. My wife ordered veggie wrap and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Coffee was refilled multiple times and the price was reasonable what more can you as for?"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing. We felt incredibly welcome from the moment we walked in, and the food was delicious. If I could give this place six stars, I would!"}
{"text":"WOW 
Food AAAA++++
Service? OMFG Service was out of this world. I have never been to any establishment with service this good. I was greeted at the front door, server was very cheerful, and dishes cleared. My water glass and coffee cup was never more than half filled. 
If you want great food, excellent service go no where else than Mr Mamas. I will be back fo sure!"}
{"text":"My family & I were on vacay from San Diego. Came across this place on Yelp. My theory is if a business has 5 stars you must check it out. That doesn't happen often. Mr Mamas does not disappoint! The staff was so friendly. Our party of 5 was seated almost immediately. 

I had the eggs Benedict with home fries covered in grilled onions & peppers. Hubby had the ribeye steak & eggs. My 16 yr old had country fried steak & eggs. My 10 year old had biscuits & gravy with hash browns. My 5 year old had pancakes. Everything was cooked perfectly! 

If you're a local you definite have to check this place out. And you better believe that when we come back for vacay we will be back as well! 

Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple years ago and loved it. Back again, one word.... AMAZING! The customer service is absolutely fantastic. Got a killer greeting by Mr.Mamas himself. Wish I could give them a 10!"}
{"text":"One of the best Brunches & very polite & friendly staff. Their omlets & panckaces are awesome and all of their staff are so intimate."}
{"text":"I had the clam chowder and eggs Benedict florentine. I was a little skeptical about the clam chowder being from the east coast and all. It was delicious! The eggs Benedict was plated nicely and was also good. Service was quick and friendly. Home fries were thinly sliced that had a nice crisp to it. Delicious as well! We waited 30 minutes and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"I must say, I have enjoyed great breakfast places In Las Vegas over the years, but Mr Mamas? Is by far the BEST breakfast place. This was my first time here. Usually we go to Broken Yolk or one of the dozen other places nearby for breakfast. Mr Mamas puts them all to shame. 
I judge a place by its egg making and chicken fried steak & gravy. This is the best chicken fried steak breakfast I have had in a restaurant. Homemade sausage gravy and the overeasy eggs? PERFECT. 
YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! !"}
{"text":"The service rocks! Mr Mama talks to every person who walks in the door. The food is very good and fast to the table."}
{"text":"Perfect! Super fast service. We were greeted by three different people with two minutes. They customized our order and we were eating five minutes later. The cost of our meal for two was the cost of only one had we eaten at our hotel on the strip. These people work hard to live up to their mission of keeping their customers happy. 

I'll be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I've never been to their restaurant, but I have Postmates deliver Mr. Mamas quite often. What initially drew me in was the banner Postmates uses for Mr. Mamas. It is, of course, a photo of one of their out-of-this-world cinnamon rolls, dripping in white icing and already half-eaten. These sweet treats do not last long once they are within my, or any one of my various roommates', reach. 

I've also tried the French toast which was fabulous, as well as the bacon, country fried steak and eggs. No need for anything fancy, Mr. Mamas just knows how to do breakfast the way it's supposed to be.  

The other day, as I was placing a Postmates order for what I think was the second or third day in a row, I decided to use a little forethought and added a couple bowls of chili to stash until dinner time or whenever one of us realizes that there's food left unattended and unspoiled in the fridge, Ultimately I ended up reheating a bowl for a hungry friend. Even though at least two or three days had passed since the cheese atop this mound of thick and hearty chili was freshly melted, my friend said it was the bomb-diggedy. 

This place is the cat's pajamas! Don't pass up any opportunity to enjoy a real, down home, made-with-love meal here that won't soon be forgotten! Bring your whole family for Sunday brunch, order a single cinnamon bun and have it delivered by Postmates, or stop by for that home sweet home kinda feeling and get your mama fix."}
{"text":"Just as good as the reviews say it is and a pretty good meal at a good price.  My wife and I ate there this morning and had to wait over a half hour because of its popularity.  The restaurant is well run and well staffed.  I watched a very young man scrub, not wipe, table after table as he prepared them for their next customers.  The man in charge of staging the wait and filling the tables did a great job and even came around at the end of the meal to make sure we were pleased.

My wife had the breakfast wrap and thought it was excellent.  I had the western omelet and pondered the choice between hash browns and potatoes.  I chose the hash browns and was a little disappointed.  They had a watery taste and I suspect the were steamed on the grill with water and a cover to ensure they stayed moist.  The problem was all the water was not cocked out and it diluted the oil normally used to give top hash browns their best taste.  The western omelet was very good.  Next time I will try the potatoes.  The final bill was about $21 and well worth the price."}
{"text":"Omg!!! This place is amazing!!! Amazing food, amazing customer service!! If you're In Vegas I totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good you can't go wrong. Usually a wait on Sunday's but worth it!! Service is also great"}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast sandwich, so it came out barely warm, and was looking not like a sandwich but two fried eggs with side of sausage, seriously?
The owner came over and asked how was it going, I politely explained that it was not how I expected the breakfast sandwich to be served, his response was:\" Well, I am sorry that you are disappointed!\" Than he waived dismissevly his hand at me which was very wierd, whay did he ask at all?! The sandwich was never taken off the bill when we were leaving, my husband ttied to be polite and tried to talk to him, but he was very rude and agressive and slammed the door after we left"}
{"text":"I grew up on biscuits and gravy in the Midwest so I'm always looking for great breakfast and it's hard to find. This place is fantastic. The food was awesome and the service even better. The owner even stands by the door and holds it open for you. The only issue I had was the gravy had to much sausage in it. I feel like it should be more about the gravy than the sausage. That being said, it tasted amazing. I know where I'll be getting breakfast from now on when I'm visit Vegas."}
{"text":"We were on a family vacation to Vegas from Texas and on the last day we decided to try something off the strip and found mr. Mamas and it is by far the best breakfast we have ever had, we had more than enough food and still licked our plates clean. Would definitely suggest to any one in the area."}
{"text":"Place is excellent!!...amazing service!!..Denise our waitress awesome!!..welcoming environment!!..we come from Cali and we very highly recommwnded!!...food is so delish and to say they makw there own cinnamon roll buns!! 100%% satisfied!"}
{"text":"We like the pancake even though we are not a big fan of pancake.  The biscuit with gravy was excellent.  Great service !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Very friendly staff. Highly recommend. The portions are pretty big so you might want to share."}
{"text":"Love their omelets!  All fresh and home made. Real eggs!  love their atmosphere and Mr Mamas is definitely so welcoming."}
{"text":"This place has the best service, food and pricing in the area I think. Every time we are in Vegas this place is a must have... EXCEPTIONAL!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic breakfast spot! The food is fantastic. The staff is even better! The free wifi was a god send, the corned beef hash, mmmmmm. Nothing is over seasoned, free refills and a Togo cup if you want it. I give this place the highest score. They will absolutely put a smile on your face and get you back into breakfast."}
{"text":"We waited about 20 mins (enough to go shop at Clays Candy Bar a few doors down) and well worth it!!  Huge portions- the hubs and I split the MUST do cinnamon roll and a build your own omelette. 4 eggs, plenty of yummy hash browns and toast. Add 2 coffees and BOOM.....awesome locals breaky.   And had our photo taken, to boot.  Super friendly staff. It's like eating in your moms kitchen, without the nagging."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!!! The pancakes were the size of plates, orange juice was freshly squeezed, Corned beef hash was so good, french toast delicious!!
Owner was nice and friendly with everyone and we had and good and patient waiter Claudia.
Now this is my spot to go to when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"A very nice dining experience. The host was very friendly. He immediately apologized that there would be a 15 minute wait. Who apologizes for 15 minutes?!! I don't get such a courtesy at other restaurants for 45 minute waits!! It really showed that he was genuinely happy we came by. 

Once seated, my wife ordered French toast and I got the 1 lb. burger. D E L I C I O U S ! ! !

There was a minor goof-up on the order, but the waitress apologized and immediately fixed it. The goof is not the point, it's the quick response by the server that showed true customer service and a caring sentiment for our positive experience that impressed us!

I highly recommend this restaurant. Service is good, they care about the customer, the price was right, and I would LOVE to go back when the opportunity arises!

Thank you, Mr Mamas!!!"}
{"text":"A classic breakfast spot. It does get busy though the staff does a great job of handling the crowds and keeping things moving. 

Food is simple and hearty and fairly priced."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food was good. If you are in the area it is a fine place to stop but not worth making a special trip to visit."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to eat somewhere calm away from the strip, so we came here after some quick searching.

While we waited for a table to open up, the host Shawn entertained everyone with quips and jokes while calling out names to be seated. Our server Jenna was very attentive and friendly, making us feel right at home.

Oh, and also, the food was delicious, way better than you should be getting at this price. My girlfriend had the biscuits and sausage gravy (also contains bacon and a hint of maple syrup, yum). I got the cali omelette. Both were generous portions and quite tasty.

We'll definitely return on our next trip up."}
{"text":"Wait time is always reasonable.  Amazing food (especially pancakes).  Awesome and quick staff.  Will be back again and again !!!1"}
{"text":"B+

Had a very friendly waitress. Family run operation  with owner's kids helping out by bussing tables. They will become well grounded citizens of this great nation. Spend your money here to help small business. Besides, Food is excellent. Large portions. Good for Brunch due to variety."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and they had great customer service. Our waitress Lourdes was awesome. There was a bit of a wait to be seated, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"One of the most pleasant mornings in a very long time.  Truth be told this is going to be my first review ever despite being on the site for almost four years.  Why so long...I do t really have anything fun to explain why, but the wait was well worth it to me.  

This is a family owned establishment, and they are all about making you feel like family.  While we sat for a table one of the owners made sure to converse with us and it was genuine and entertaining.  For the service alone I would go back again and again.  

The food was good too...fluffy pancakes, great wraps, burgers done really well.  This place is not fancy and you will not find truffle oil on anything, but you will be full, happy, and in a truly wonderful state of mind when you leave.

If you are a tourist please try it if even just to get away from the strip for a couple of hours.  If you are a local I am jealous.  Take care of them because they William definitely take care of you."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I have had outside my grandmas kitchen. The bacon rocks, the french toast is amazing, the pancakes are awesome, the coffee is really good, the hash-browns are done to perfection and the eggs are nicely seasoned. The service here is also amazing, wait staff is really good and cool and the owner greets everyone and really makes you feel welcome. I have not been to a place like this in a long time. Also my brother ordered the Mamma's Burger and said it was the best tasting burger he has eaten in Vegas (Where he grew up and lived for 23 years). All I can say is THANKS MR.MAMMA'S FOR ROCKIN!"}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad to say about this place. It is 6 star. It is so well managed, the guy at the door is a friendly host, he gets you seated as fast as he can. The servers are polite freindly & fast. The food is severed quickly , hot and good size portions. Very reasonable  prices for vegas too. The coffee is the best!  There is free wifi.  They care for every aspect.  I Love this place can you tell?"}
{"text":"I love it here.  Even though it's not super fancy like the upper scale hotels here in Vegas, you can bet on getting that more personal/ friendly experience and win!  FOOD IS AMAZING!  I would definitely come here again.  Not to mention the price is right!   You may even get your picture taken."}
{"text":"Mr.Mamas makes you feel welcome and at home, from the first greeting to the check.  Breakfast was great, the omelettes are the real deal, and the service was attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"So glad we chose to try this place out. I was getting tired of going to the same spot whenever Friends or Family is in town. Went onto Trip Advisor and read the reviews, because a good friend of ours highly recommended this restaurant. We waited for a bit, but it's worth it. Can't wait to go back again and try different dishes with my whole Family. 

Our hostess was friendly and happy, which is very inviting..People kept coming and it was a bit busy and food took a bit longer than expected, but it was yummy. Portions are very shareable. Only downfall was, nobody came by to refill our beverages. Hash browns extra crispy was a plus as well. 

Date of Visit: July 15, 2017"}
{"text":"I'm sure you've read the other reviews. And wow this place is spot on. Meal was amazing portions are more than enough. The real shine is the staff. Just made me feel like this is my local dinner. Left full and happy. A must eat."}
{"text":"Best service ever! I work next door at State Farm and go to Mr Mamas almost everyday. The staff is so polite and accommodating ( I often make strange requests), and the owner Nick is just amazing . Shawn and Ilene always go out of there way to put a special touch on whatever I order. I highly recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday morning @ 8:30am. Not crowded. Immediately greeted warmly and seated. I will say I had the best omelet I ever ate in my life. It was so good. This is my second time here and I said it the first time. I ordered the Cali omelet no sausage and extra veggies. It was huge and delicious. Big enough to share, which we did, and we're gladly assisted my the friendly waitress and offered an extra plate. We also ordered one pancake which was  also huge to share at the end of our omelet. I didn't get to eat my half of pancake because I was so full.  I swear it's something they do with the eggs. They are extra fluffy and so yummy. The OJ tastes amazing and is like sticking a straw in an orange. The service and food are both 5 star worthy. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I've only had their food once but wow! They do not skimp on their pancake size!! I loved their food! My coworker and I ordered food for pick up one morning while we were carving breakfast food, we were such happy workers after. We even had extra food after. 

I need to eat from here more often!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the staff was great! There were people waiting 30+ minutes just to eat here, it's that good. It's worth the wait if there is one. You can tell the employees have a lot of pride in this place in which they should. It's a great place to have breakfast/lunch if you're looking to get away from the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!!!!! I had an omelette to die for and homefries....I love that they give options...instead of toast I had a HUGE yummy pancake. The staff was so kind and helpful.  Definitely want to come back before heading back to NY"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Awesome food!! I came from a small town so to find this little gem where the owner greets every customer is amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp two days ago and we already had to bring the rest of the family in. 9am on a Saturday morning with no wait, we were greeted enthusiastically by at least 5 people when we walked through the door and 3 people teamed up to get our party of 7 sat. It was refreshing being somewhere that these folks obviously want to be and enjoy their jobs. The food came out timely, refills constantly happened throughout the meal and we were regularly checked in on. 
I don't even know where to start on the food. FANTASTIC! 
This is a place I will definitely come back to when I am back in town and deserves a 10 star rating!"}
{"text":"FABULOUS food and prices!  The owner and wait staff are friendly and highly professional! The owner makes you feel welcome and takes an interest in each customer without being overbearing. We had a group of 5 for breakfast and we all ordered something different. Food was brought out fast, fresh and hot. About 10 minutes in traffic from the Luxor hotel. This is a must do!"}
{"text":"I would buy a plane ticket just to come back here from Colorado. The corned beef hash is quite possibly the best breakfast meal I have had at any restaurant ever. Also, bacon, sausage AND a touch of maple syrup in the gravy! Are you kidding me?! Phenomenal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place the other day and we were so glad we did.  We are happy to find a new breakfast spot so close to our house. My boyfriend had French toast with side of eggs and sausage and loved it. I had a bacon breakfast sandwich. It was good. After having a few bites of his French toast I decided it was so good I to order a single order. We left stuffed and happy.  The owner was very friendly and we loved his personality.  We will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We found something amazing and special on a fluke.  We ordered an Uber to a different location and our driver informed us of renovations and that our original destination was closed. He recommended Mr. Mama's and dropped us off. The wait was about 20\" but the place is run with military precision!  A couple seated shortly after we arrived was paying their bill and leaving just as we were being seated.   
The food and service and the price was all excellent and we got an amazing assortment from their menu for our party of 6. The bill was the most reasonable of our entire stay in Sin City!!
We will certainly be back any and every time we are back in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place, however go there long enough and you'll find that it's not the best. The food is alright but it's going downhill.  There are much better places to go... And this place is getting a little pricey too."}
{"text":"First time here and have to agree wholeheartedly with the 5* ratings. Food was delicious, huge portions and fresh. Staff was great, from the gentleman who greets you at the door to the servers and buspersons. Be prepared for a short wait to get a seat, but they get you settled quickly. Large menu. 
We had 4 people (2 from out of town) and all 4 gave it 5*. The pancakes are wonderful, as were the home made biscuits.
The YELP deal is incredible. 
Try it, you'll like it.
We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Today a kind lady brought food out to my car since I was unable to come in. When she came she came with such a kind demeanor and warm smile! 
As I was making my order the gentleman on the phone with the deep voice was just that a gentleman.
It's so refreshing when you find a good quality place that has already become established with popularity and then you see they also provide outstanding service."}
{"text":"My first time here after searching for a place away from the Strip. I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and friendly staff. They had a full house on a weekday at lunch hour. The food and service were both excellent. It was the first bacon cheeseburger that I truly enjoyed in a very long time."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast since they had pretty good reviews. Once we got there the door was opened for us by a gentlemen which we found out later was Mr Mama. He's very personable and  a great host. Service was also great. Sat down right away, got our order in and food came out in a timely manner. Would definitely eat her again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Really good food! Great customer service! You will not regret eating here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The excellent reviews are all accurate. I ate here with friends on our way to Red Rock, and what a nice break from restaurants on the strip.  We had a delicious meal with outstanding service.  The waitress couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, and the coffee refills were frequently offered. The owner greeted everyone at the door and we had such a nice conversation with him. He prides himself in his customer service and it shows in every facet.  The food was delicious, prices were reasonable, and service was efficiently served with a smile.  I can't say enough good things about this gem!"}
{"text":"Somehow there was a mixup on my yelp. Mr. Mamas 
Has always been one of my fave for price and quality. Sorry for the mixup Nick.  Your bud Rudy"}
{"text":"Service is bomb.  Food is Bomb.  Prices are bomb.  We ordered the pancakes and omelet.  Food is fresh.  Do yourself a favor and go when you're in town."}
{"text":"Great staff, friendly service, and delicious food! 

The country-fried steak, Cali omelette, and pancakes  were the highlights of our brunch. We love coming to this place and will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I make it a point to eat here every time I'm in Vegas. The owner runs a tight ship and the service and food reflects it. You won't catch anyone saying \"that's not my table\" here. Support a local business that deserves to be supported. Eat at Mr Mamas  you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The best breakfast ever!

The best food period!  The owner greets customers at the door, the food is hot, tasty, fast, and fresh, and the service is top shelf.  I liked the old location better :-).  Whenever we visit Vegas, we always stop by Mr. Mamas for breakfast at least 2 times during our visit.  My only regret is that this restaurant is not on the East Coast.  They also have a great coupon in the entertainment book.   Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing food was great my waitress Jena was so polite she made sure that we satisfied you have to try it! I had the Cali omelet and my wife had French toast with sausage and eggs. Food portions are very large so be ready for a feast."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast. This was my second time here. Tried eggs benedict and sausage breakfast burrito and both were made perfectly. Decor is simple but homey and very clean. I appreciate that there's a good distance between tables which increases your 'privacy'.
The owner is an excellent professional with a proactive stand always finding ways to improve this place and deliver a premium service for the clients.
Will definitely be back.
Excellent place, in a quiet part of town."}
{"text":"Love this place! My family and I went a Group of 10, they were so accommodating and friendly. Mr. Momma was so nice and very attentive since we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table large enough for our group! Loved it and highly encourage it! Portions are pretty large, so you can share!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm this is a fabulous place Nick is Mr Mama he came out and talked to his patrons was talking and serving he is a very humble man. Denise was our waitress she's so sweet and always made sure we had what we needed ,Twan was awesome to. Thank you for a great experience will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Liked everything about this place! Greeted at the door by the manager, small wait,(always a good sign), happy looking staff and customers and the food was great! We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! We just came for burgers, but we were impressed with everything! I had the bacon avocado as most of us did, but one brave soul in our party went for the momma's burger! It was huge! And delicious! 

The owner was there interacting with all of the guests, seating people and even bussing tables! The whole feel of this place is very comforting, I would recommend you try it! 

Reasonable prices and very fast service, we're new to Las Vegas and this will surely become a regular place for us to eat at!"}
{"text":"Great food and a good price!  The staff were extremely friendly and courteous.  They gave us advice on things to do since we were from out of town. It may sound silly but I was also impressed as they had the toilet seat covers in their single room bathroom. I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to this. Everything about this place was great!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food was great. Drinks were horrible. water tasted gross maybe they need new filter. Coffee was not good and orange juice was some sugary orange flavor drink. Overall it was good just not sure what to drink next time"}
{"text":"Found this spot on Yelp, while in Vegas on vacation best breakfast we've had all week and most value for the price"}
{"text":"This place is still amazing! The owners meet you at the door and are super friendly. The food is fantastic...what else can I say!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast before heading to airport and so glad we did!  Great food, great people and wonderful service!  We will definitely be back when we come back to Vegas. Special thanks to Jasmine and the cool dude at the door."}
{"text":"I have only had a sample of the gravy so far but whoa! They service so far has me set to come back. The atmosphere is great and what you need to get ready to leave the strip. I will recommend to whoever is out this way. Eat here you will be happy."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and everyone is right. This place is extremely welcoming and the food is very good! We love weekend breakfast and often go to the other two local places on our side of town. Mr. Mamas will be added to our rotation. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Manager Shaun goes ABOVE and beyond to please the customers!  (As do all the employees). This place is a must visit when you're in Vegas.  Awesome food, amazing people and a fun friendly environment. 

P.s., Shaun is a world-renowned \"elevated\" iPhone photographer. His pics are impeccable!"}
{"text":"The Staff was super friendly and attentive. My breakfast of biscuits and gravy with an egg was just ok. Food needed seasonings."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Worth the wait on a Saturday morning. The Marty wrap was sooooog good. Definitely coming back to their place. The owner is super nice and comes around telling the coolest stories."}
{"text":"PRO:

{"text":"What can you say when you're made to feel at home before you are called for table? It's breakfast. They serve fresh, hearty portions of real food from the heart. The service is super friendly and attentive.
Doggie bags by request.
Thanks, Be. Mama!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Great food, best service you will find, and a friendly atmosphere.  Worth renting a car just to go.  You won't regret making the trip."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe. Nick is wonderful owner. Best breakfast in town, this from a local. Had the greek omelet and french toast. Both were delicious and worth the money. Rest of group had had the cali omelet. Looked great. Their comments were great about the food. You will not be dissapointed...."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast with my Honeycrisp at MMs.  The service was outstanding with everyone smiling and happy to help us out.   Food came just as ordered.  The pancakes are so fluffy and yet so filling at the same time.  Bacon was crisp and the hash browns (ordered well done with onions) were as well.   Love this sunny place a couple of miles off the strip."}
{"text":"So amazing and so yummy!! Loved the friendly staff and amazing service!! Would recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Incredible find for breakfast! We came here just by chance and everyone loved it. I asked for the server to build a country Benedict, biscuit with sausage and a poached egg smothered in gravy. Usually it comes out weird, but they got it right on. The gravy has bacon, sausage and a hint of maple syrup in it. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Loved everything we ordered even down to the coffee!  Service was the greatest I seen in Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"Are here twice the past week. Had the eggs  Benedict the first time. The English muffin was dry, the eggs were overcooked, and there wasn't enough sauce on top. The second visit I thought I would try there famous biscuits and gravy which they claim is the best. Don't waste your time. They put bacon and Maple syrup in them and it throws off the taste. There's just something missing from them, maybe salt? Staff was friendly except for the tattooed host that would occasionally bully them."}
{"text":"Good food. Will be back!!! Greeted at the door was a great surprise. Kind waiters and bus boys checked up on us at the right time."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Service Service Service!!

Nothing more enjoyable when the staff and the service is top notch!!  5star service at this great American breakfast and lunch  Resturant!!  Oh and the food is fricken on point too!! 

I work at a 5 star 5 diamond establishment and I like to pamper myself and enjoy being served-well when I'm a consumer, and this place got it service skills down!!  

Congrats to this fine establishment. Others so call eateries that put their \"food 1st and people's skills 2nd can definitely take notes from this awesome Resturant."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. About 10-15 away from the strip, but if you're looking for quality food and service it's worth the drive. 

Once you're there expect a 20-30 min wait.

Every time I'm in Vegas, it's a \"must-go\"."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and felt healthy! The service was beyond friendly , everything was spotlessly clean and we even met Mr. Mama! I would absolutely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended, especially if you're a visitor to Sin City and looking for a breakfast/lunch place not too far away from the expensive casino restaurants. Delicious quality food, good portions, reasonable prices, staff is superb, excellent service, family atmosphere kid friendly menu, and basically no complaints. I will definitely make it a point to go back to Mr. Mama's next time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Mr. Mama's is great.  It's even better now that they have their bigger location.  It is a great break from eating on the strip when you're in Las Vegas.  Good food and even better service.  I'm only in Las Vegas a few times a year but always eat breakfast there at least once,  they are always friendly and act as if you're a long time customer.  I haven't ever had anything there that I haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"Short and sweet review! They no doubt live up to their 5 star rating. Perfect breakfast from start to finish and worth the wait on a Sunday morning!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Friendly staff, GREAT food.  Huge portions.  Only problem is it gets very busy, but it's tough to fault a place for being popular."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast joint. Nothing super special about any of the meals such as fanciness and what not but overall great staff all with a great attitude (especially for being a morning food place). I'm not a morning person so to see such genuine great attitudes to start your day is great. Nothing bad to say about the placd. Food and service both deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews  bring me here and I can  say  I was not disappointed, even a single piece. The place is really good especially for breakfast. Pretty quiet, feels like home to me.  The service is also fantastic.  This restaurant  will go a long way because their staff are very friendly.  Coffee is always full.  Ordered french toast, chicken  fried steak with eggs and all of them taste excellent and very affordable.  You can never go wrong with Mr. Mamas"}
{"text":"Check this place out about 2 weeks ago when taking a family trip out to Las Vegas. We were heading back to San Diego and wanted breakfast. I pull up my trusty Yelp app and this one came up.  They got really good review so figure we check it out. 

When we got there, there was a little wait 20-30mins. Not to mention it was really way out from the strip but was on the way leaving Las Vegas so it workout for us. 25mins later we were able to get a table for 5. The restaurant looks like a older style diner but with some newer vibe. I like it. Very family originated feel which I like.  Food wise, good portion, fresh, has variety of options from breakfast to lunch and dinner. The wait staff was attentive. I'm liking this place. For coming here the first time, not bad, will come out and try it again next time we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wonderful greetings, special specially in morning when one haven't had coffee. Host even call my name correctly . Super great service, but the food is just fresh and delicious. My compliments to the chefs. Price so reasonable."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing! The food, the service, the attentiveness to all the patrons. These amazing folks work hard to please. Probably the best breakfast I've had on our trip around the South West. Hubby enjoyed his omelette very much. I had the Marty and it was awesome! Worth the 20 min wait. The drive and location away from the strip was much more appealing than trying to go to a breakfast buffet with mediocre food on the strip. Easy to get to, park and they accommodate the little ones. Thanks for a memorable breakfast."}
{"text":"What a great unexpected find for breakfast! 
Great service and food and will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I have been working my way through all of the top rated breakfast establishments in Las Vegas (as rated by yelp) as so far, this is the best I have found.

Upon arriving, a friendly gentleman  came outside to greet us in the car park and welcome us in, once inside another gentleman (I believe the owner / proprietor)  welcomed us enthusiastically and we were quickly shown to a table. 

Our drinks order was taken as soon as we were seated at our table, and the drinks were delivered very quickly after that. As soon as our drinks order had been taken care of, our waitress (yet another friendly and enthusiastic member of staff) introduced herself and took our orders.

Food arrived fairly quickly, was well presented and most importantly tasted great.

We had Denver omelets, and a side of French toast, and a side of sausage. 

The sausage was the flat patty type, nothing spectacular, but good enough. 

The French toast was very nice, well presented, nice tasting, not overdone on the flavour and served with warm maple syrup, very nice indeed.

Finally the Denver omelet was excellent! Really nice and tasty, cooked just right, looked really appetising and neatly presented. I had potatoes with mine, which I also opted to have with peppers and onions (which turned out to be a good choice) the peppers and onions were very finely chopped and worked great with the sliced potatoes, which were cooked as close to perfection as you are going to find.

Overall the food was really enjoyable, and left me wanting to return to try other items on the menu. (which I certainly will) The thing that really stands out however, is the service! Everyone was so enthusiastic and friendly, it certainly puts you in a positive mood. I would be surprised if you can find anywhere else in Vegas with service to the incredibly high standard of Mr Mama's, absolutely perfect service!

I purchased a Yelp coupon to use during this visit, and unfortunately I was unable to redeem the coupon as it was showing as invalid when staff tried to process it. Even though this was clearly not the fault of Mr Mama's, staff were apologetic and the owner even offered to effectively give us our meal for free. I could not accept this as the meal was so good and I purchased a second coupon on my phone, which did work fine, now I just need to resolve the issue with the first one with Yelp. This shows how staff are willing to go above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. 

I look forward to visiting again and I would wholeheartedly recommend Mr Mama's to anyone!"}
{"text":"Visited Mr. Mamas this weekend for the first time. The service was superb and our server was so friendly & helpful. The Albacore Tuna Melt was yummy. I will definitely go again!! Great job Mr. Mamas."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME & AMAZING
in service , food and environment!!
All the ramping and raving of this place is all true! Best of all clean and super busy means people come back for all the right reasons!!!
We will be BACK!!"}
{"text":"Great food , French toast are the bomb. Cali omelette so good , I only got it with 2 eggs and it was still big . Come again for sure"}
{"text":"We went to mr Mamas after seeing the reviews. It was better!  The breakfast was excellent. The best orange juice ever. Every item prepared correctly. Service was also excellent. We went back the next day. Prices were reasonable too. Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try here with the good reviews.  Sunday morning and the place was hopping.  Forty minute wait to get a table.  Lenore, our waitress was marvelous, great service with a smile.  I had the ham steak and eggs, food was delicious and as ordered but I guess I'm spoiled with the casino food, the ham was about three ounces with no bone and priced at over ten dollars.  My wife had eggs Benedict with sausage.  The sausage was good, but the eggs were over cooked and had to be sent back.  On their return the yolks were still hard, seems poaching eggs was not working today.  Also the hollindaise sauce was bland, bland, bland!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on our way out of town and they made us feel like we were home already. Great food and even greater people and service. My family will be stopping every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in all of Vegas.  Eat here everytime i am in the area.  Cheers to the Mamas French Toast.  Sooooooooooooooooooooo Good"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a long weekend. I was in the mood for a change from the usual Vegas buffets. I looked up a good breakfast place on yelp and came across Mr. Mamas. Before we even reached the front door, Nick opened it and kindly greeted us like family. We were immediately seated, and our server was great as well. I had delicious chocolate chip pancakes, eggs & sausage. It was amazing, the pancakes were so light and fluffy. My husband had steak & eggs, with hash browns. He loved it! We enjoyed it so much, we had to go back the next day again for lunch, which was terrific once again! Really the customer service will amaze you! Everyone is extremely kind and attentive. What else can I say, this place is a true gem!! Get off the strip and have a meal here.. You won't forget your experience at Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"Went to Mr Mama's for a team members birthday. Our team of 11 in attendance.There is no opportunity to call in advance so we arrived and checked in. The team advises that arrive time was 11:48 am - apparently the log time was 11:53 am - basically 5 minute difference. Advised that the wait would be about 30 minutes. Numerous customers arrived after our team, and were seated. The person who greets customers (later identifying himself as the owner) asked if we all had to sit together and we said yes.  He then said that they were waiting for three tables to open up and that the customers seated at the tables had finished eating and they were waiting for them to get up.  He then motioned to the area. I looked at that section and all but 1 table had customers seated and eating.  We were still being patient. Finally, I called the owner over at 12:22 pm to inquire about progress and he became confrontational saying that we \"were patient with him he would be accommodating, if not, he would not be accommodating\".  He proceeded to berate me in front of customers and my team.  I advised my team that they could stay, but I was leaving.  The owner approached a team member and asked how many in the party.  My team member commented that he was rude to her boss.  The owner then turned and directed his staff to \"break the tables apart\" (which were still only two).  The remaining team had no choice but to leave.  Not good customer service by any stretch of the imagination.   Will never go back - any of the 11 of us."}
{"text":"Went here twice on a business trip.   Fast friendly service. Tasty food done quick and fresh.  Great prices for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place!!! As an avid motorcycle rider who enjoys incorporating a good place to eat into the ride, you have to make this a stop. It's away from the hustle and bustle from the main strip and the service was top notch. Claudia our server was charismatic and kept our drinks topped off. 

The food was fresh and tasted amazing. The menu selection was extensive and the prices were good."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas last year and ate here twice with great service and then tried a different place that was not as good. I came back to Vegas and bought 4 $15 coupons for $30 worth of food from Yelp and made sure to eat here all 4 days that we are here. Food/service is great and the new location has plenty of parking. We plan to always eat here when we make our annual trip  to Vegas."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for steering us to this amazing spot. Delicious food, large portions and great value. I had Eggs Benedict which were perfect and daughter had Mama's short stack and my son had the chili cheese omelet. Our bill was less than $40. It was double that on the strip testers for similar fare."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The owner is on site most of the time and he is fantastic."}
{"text":"First off - OUTSTANDING breakfast this morning!!!  The first day of their celebrated reopening (at their new location; a couple miles from the old lo-cal).  But low cal-ories was not what I had in mind; and Nick, who provided us with his personal greeting (he's the owner of Mr. Mama's Breakfast & Lunch) stopped by our table to talk love of my being a Buckeye, and him a Wolverine - (Big Ten sticks together anywhere).  Back to the food, customer service and setting - THE BEST chili cheese omelette, ever!!!  Great service attentiveness and the new location is only a couple miles from the old; and much more space!!!  All around, the exclamation marks were flowing for Nick and his Mr. Mama's restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"During a business trip on our way back home in L.A. decided to eat for once outside of the hotel restaurants, quick Yelp search and found 5 Stars for Mr. Mamas, not common, therefore I was curious about it, what a surprise!
We arrived in 2 SUV's parked right on front and while walking towards the doors one opens and a friendly face greets us, \"come on in you look ready for breakfast\" (it was already lunch time, but he was not wrong) 8 of us, including a baby, experienced, as we entered a clean spacious vibrant place, friendly faces all over and the big fellow whom had great us walk us personally to our table, within seconds our waitress made herself available and coffees and OJ's started to appear. When asked about a good plate her answer was \"I am confident whichever you choose will be to your liking\" and she was right on the money! We all are coffee people and we all took the first sip, agreed that it was one of the best coffees we have ever had. The food? Well see for yourself too bad food aromas are not carried using yelp, yet! However you will have the opportunity to experience it personally. Highly recommended 
Being a business owner, I am all about customer service, and I want to thank the Owner, yes he is the one who opened the door, escorted us to the table, came to check 2 times if everything was to our liking and even had time to chat with our littlest member of the family, our waitresses a mom and daughter team and busser where there and at the same time almost invisible except when needed, I learned about true customer service without all the fanfare and with lots of TLC from the whole staff. Thank You all and I will see you soon"}
{"text":"Took my hubby in for his birthday. Friendliest, most efficient customer service EVER. The coffee is great! The food is great! If everyone ate here, there wouldn't be so much bad sh*t going on in the world. We'll be back! Thanks, Mr. Mama's owners and staff."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for brunch! My husband and I absolutely love this spot. The employees are so friendly and the waitresses always check up on us. Not only that, but the prices are awesome!Great food without spending a lot of money. One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"B'fast was very good place is clean. Waitress's very attentive and would come back next time i'm in Vegas.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, our 4 egg omelet with spinach, parmesan and cheddar was huge and the avocados were delicious. Our one French toast superb, staff is courteous and even the Boss, helped!  The team work is awesome and atmosphere great, we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area this is a must stop.. we were very lucky to find this hidden gem. The food is amazing much better than the strip. I'm so glad that we went off the beaten path and found this place. Everyone in there was so sweet and kind you feel very welcomed as if you were having a bite to eat at grandmas house.. I loved this place kudos to the owners.. my pancakes were delicious!!! They employee were fabulous"}
{"text":"Food....Service.....everything A++.  Chicken Fried Steak and their potatoes are some of the best I have ever had.  The maple syrup is a nice touch.  Can't wait to go back.  Even Mr Mama stops by to say hi.  It really makes you feel appreciated there."}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, my husband and I decided to stop in. We're vacationing from Dallas, TX and wanted a good breakfast. As always, my fellow Yelpers didn't guide us wrong.  Our visit was AMAZING!!! The service was wonderful, everyone was so nice and attentive. You could tell by the interaction with the staff that they genuinely appreciated us for stopping in. The food was marvellous and very cost effective! One breakfast meal was enough for two or more servings. I can honestly say, that was the best service I've received in a long time. The meal didn't take long to arrive, it was nice and hot..I can't find a single thing to complain about. I admonish anyone looking for great food and great service to give them a try. I'm so very glad we did!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal service and food was just as great! It's is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The cook was caughing over the food wiping his nose and touching the food without washing his hands or covering his mouth.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade pancakes& the staff was extremely friendly and attentive... Def one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Overall, a Very Nice Experience\"

Six of us arrived for breakfast at 10am, and the place was still about 80% full... good sign! The door was opened, and we were welcomed with a smile by Mr. Mama himself. There is no pretentiousness about this place. It is just one large room with tables and chairs, no booths. The server was on us instantly, asking for our coffee, juice and water order, with no pressure for the breakfast order... Nice! I ordered 2 pancakes and a side of sausage patties, both were perfect. The pancakes are fluffy, and nearly the size of the plate, (glad I didn't order a \"stack\" which is 3 pancakes). A stack with a side would be enough to feed an adult and two children. The rest of our group had similarly sized portions of eggs, potatoes, etc. One of our group had the home made corned beef hash, one of the best ever! The server was attentive, constantly checking coffee refills and making sure we were otherwise satisfied. Mr. Mama showed a genuine interest in our satisfaction, thanked us, and asked us to return."}
{"text":"Really delicious. Charming establishment. Sorta pricy and not the largest portion. Ordered Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant I have ever frequented.  I am rating Mr Mamas a five-star place for everything: the food, customer service, facility, and price. 

The owner Nick will open the door and greet you when you walk up to the restaurant. Then he will get you seated right away ... and if the place is busy he will let you know how long your wait will be, offer you a chair, and be extra attentive to you. While he is doing this, he is aware of everything that is going on in his restaurant, from the guests' needs to the activities of his staff.  This place is full of good energy!

Claudia was our great waitress. She served us water and coffee, then took our orders, and came back with our hot food not too long after. She, the other staff members, the owner, and even the hostess made their rounds through out the restaurant and stopped by our table often enough to clear empty plates and to make sure that our water glasses and coffee cups were never empty. 

We didn't order anything extraordinary but what we did order was excellent:

Pancakes: really really good. 
Ham steak: perfect portion perfectly cooked. 
Hash browns: golden crispy. 
Biscuit gravy: very good. Gravy had bits of sausage and bacon in it. 
Wedge salad: they added sliced onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers to it. This added to the presentation. I loved it, but husband would ask for those on the side next time. 
Home fries: truly the best!
Bacon: perfectly not overly cooked crispy. 
Cinnamon rolls: daughter got a free one for her birthday. I am not big on sweets, but this is really really good. 
Coffee: good
Eggs: expectedly prepared as ordered. 

I asked for a side order of fresh jalapeños for my sunny side up eggs and they came out nicely diced. 

I liked this restaurant the moment I walked in. It is spacious and clean and generates good energy. All the staff is aware of all the going-ons in the restaurant, as well as being super politely friendly. I will definitely come here again the next time I come to to Vegas. 

The only minor minus is although they have separate restrooms, their restrooms have only one stall."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and trip advisor. 
We waited 30 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. We had a wrap and the cali omelet. 
Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The breakfast from Mr. Mamma's was probably the highlight of my stay in Vegas! The not so short drive from the strip and 15 minute wait when we got there were absolutely worth it! Never before had I had potatoes that were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. Revolutionary. My friend and I both had the Spanish omelette and french toast after seeing the many tempting pictures on Yelp. Both amazing! And so satisfying! My friend was raving about her juice, I had coffee. My cup, by the way, was never empty thanks to our server who was sweet and super attentive.
We practically rolled out of our seats when we were through everything. That was probably enough to keep us going until dinner!

Thanks Mr. Mamma's, we will be coming back every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint! Friendly and attentive staff even when they are busy weekend mornings. I always order Chicken fried steak and biscuits with gravy. They have a great lunch menu too! Perfect place to relax before work. Being super affordable is a huge plus."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is top notch and the service is very warm. Being away from the usual Vegas crowd and tricks makes it even better."}
{"text":"We saw the reviews for this place on Yelp. When we arrived it was pretty packed. We were seated right away. Was really clean. Staff was super friendly, they checked on us, chatted with us and took great care of us. As we left the owner shook our hand and several staff told us to have a great day. I have been in the restaurant business most of my life and was super impressed with the great attitude and service! 

The FOOD was well presented and awesome! I had the the bisquits and gravy had a smokey bacon flavor. The waitress recommended the California omlete. Was really good. Would totally go back here. 

The bill came out to about 40$ for the two of us. Was a little pricey but worth it . Overall great family restraunt!"}
{"text":"Great service and food was gooooood.  It reminded us what restaurant service is all about. The owner was super nice and the staff was great. We ordered french toast was great, pancakes on point, eggs Benedict was good and the greek omelette was okay but once i added the homemade salsa it was on point. That maybe because I love sauces but everything else was good.  
It felt like going to a families house to eat very warm and friendly place. I will be going back"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money at this place. I took my kids hoping to get a good breakfast but what I got was poor in taste and small in portions. I mean for the price they charged I would have been better off at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Good food. Great customer service; however, they might be going a bit overboard. Got a handshake from the manager right before my food arrived. Had to go and wash my hands again. Will come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Positive - This place is excellent. Go there. Have an omelet. The pancakes are delightful!

Excellent service!

Negative - The lines for breakfast on the weekend can get pretty long, and thus have a long wait time."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast joint. Food was very good, and the staff were excellent! I'll be back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"New, bigger location, same quality food and service.  Love coming here, get my fill, and will skip my next meal due to not being hungry.  Worth finding."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an extremely negative experience the night before at the Holiday Inn Express on Rainbow Blvd.  Found this restaurant on yelp. When we walked in we were greeted so kindly, . The customer service was extraordinary and our breakfast was memorably delicious! Our spirits were picked up for the rest of the day :-)
(HIE should definitely take customer service lessons from these folks)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Portions could be slightly bigger, but the quality made up for it. Nice staff. The restroom was clean.  It has an automatic foam soap dispenser which was was nice. It also had an automatic paper towel dispenser. I actually had to use the women's restroom because someone was in the men's. It is a single use restroom anyway so it wasn't weird. In conclusion, great restaurant, great restroom. I had the corned beef."}
{"text":"Do it!! Don't even give it another thought!!! One of the best breakfast places I've ever been too. Food was phenomenally tasty and abundant.  Staff was so friendly too. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Wow!! For a mom and pop off the main strip excellent. There was a 30 minute wait but well worth it. I asked for a cup of coffee while I waited and they were happy to bring it to me. Definitely a locals spot but highly recommend to skip the hotel breakfast and visit the gem. Fresh, tasty food with pleasant service. Very affordable. I will return."}
{"text":"Amazing food, good prices, and exceptional customer service! Our new favorite breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to have a tasty breakfast and given that this has great reviews we decided to give this place a try and we have no regrets. Wait time was reasonable and the food was delicious! I had the steak and eggs plate and for once in my life they did not say no to cooking my eggs the way I like them. They have great customer service! And Although we are from out of state, I will definitely keep this on my list of places to visit when in town."}
{"text":"Ok just found a fantastic breakfast resturant. Not only good food but a very pleasent environment and staff. A well oiled machine of happiness. How refreashing"}
{"text":"Came here Super Bowl sunday with my siblings. This was on our food list to try this vacation. I actually called in advanceand asked how long the wait was. The lady who picked up the call was very friendly and told me there wasn't a wait at the moment but could change any time. We got to the restaurant around 9ish and were seated right away. 

Our server was Jac (Jackie) who was really attentive and nice! We asked what were recommended and favorites-chicken fried steak, eggs benedict, eggs florentine was her fave, and the omelettes. My brother and I shared the Chicken Fried Steak and my 2 sisters shared the Eggs Benedict with a side of Bacon. Food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. The bacon was also crispy just the way I like it. The hollandaise sauce on there was the right amount too. 

The restaurant was clean, had TVs available (at that time it was on ESPN i think covering NFL stuff which was awesome) and the staff was really friendly! 

When we left they were starting to get busy. So helpful tip would be to call ahead to know what you may expect on the wait!

I regret not trying the cinnamon roll or the french toast so that would be next on my list when I come to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and read the great reviews. My family and I decided to try it and we were not disappointed. My husband loved his chicken fried steak. The rest of us got pancakes and they were delish! The staff was great and the owner came by and checked on us several times. So far the best meal we've had on this trip!!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming environment!  My husband and I were in Las Vegas for the weekend. Glad we came across this place for breakfast! So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"While in town for a baseball tournament I looked for something that was local to grab some breakfast. This may have been the best decision for meals on the trip. I had the eggs Benedict with hash browns and my daughter had the build your own omelette and my wife order the half order biscuits and gravy. Plenty of food for all of us. Everything was home made and hot. The wait staff was over the top friendly. Although one young lady was responsible for taking care of us at least 4 different people attended to our every need. They worked together to take care of all the guests. Great job!  Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere was great, wait time for food was 13 min a ticket. 3 out of 5 stars for service. Our waitress took our drink and food orders after our drinks were at the table we didn't see her or have her check on us until it was time to pay."}
{"text":"I've  been going to Mr. Mama's for well over 3 years and it gets better every time  I go. Kat is a joy and always friendly double checking in everything. She put the word manage in manager. Denisse my waitress was spot on  as she  took excellent care of me. Otis and Jordan checked on me several times making sure my glass was always full and  dirty dishes were off the table. I've  brought people in and recommended  to many many more. Thanks Mr. Mama's (Nick) for creating such an AWESOME  establishment!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas over the weekend and was able to stop here Monday morning as we were heading back to Orange County. I love this place. Great food, quick good service and now with the new location lots of room.

I always try and hit this place once during each of my Las Vegas trips."}
{"text":"Love that the staff here learns your name when your a regular and is friendly and jokes with you freely. Breakfast and linch options are good portions, reasonably priced and just flat out good food. Only wish it was closer to home for me :)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. When you get sick of eating on the strip and just want hearty, homemade food and a personal, neighborhood vibe, this place does not disappoint.

My family and I ate breakfast or lunch here for seven days of a seven-day vacation, and we are hard to please NYers. The food was simple in the best possible way, reasonably priced and filling. The staff is totally awesome and takes customer service seriously. They are amazingly friendly, helpful and accommodating. As, as another reviewer mentions, they seem genuinely happy to be there.

We chose to visit this place originally based on the Yelp reviews, and I am pleased to say they were completely accurate!"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times, kept trying to see if it would get better but never did. I am a huge biscuit and gravy fan and I couldn't even choke these down. Had a wrap once and everything was falling out and the tortilla was broken. Service is horrible. Better off going to dennys"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to visit again! Mr. Mamas still continues to be my favorite \"go-to\" breakfast place when I'm in town. I tried the pancakes and sausage this time, and they were fantastic! Our server was just okay, but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is seriously my favorite meal, so I'm pretty picky. This place does not disappoint. The food was really good! Thick cut bacon, pancakes were really fluffy, and crispy hash browns!! Yes. But the service.... it's what makes it even better. Everyone is really friendly, always someone checking on you. Our waitress was Jenna, she's awesome, and Shawn made sure we had everything we needed. This will always be our stop in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time! Well worth the drive from the strip. Service, food, and overall experience were all exceptional."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The moment you walk in you are greeted with a smile and told to pick a spot wherever you like. The restaurant is clean and inviting with comfortable chairs and well kept tables. The menu had a good selection of breakfast choices.

 I ordered french toast with bacon and my boyfriend ordered the California omelet. The food came very quickly and looked amazing. The omelet had large slices of avocado on top with sour cream and pico de gallo. My french toast was golden and fluffy with cinnamon sprinkled on as it cooked  (I assume) & dusted with the perfect amount of powdered sugar. The bacon was the thick cut kind which was surprising  because most places cheap out with the super thin bacon. 

The owner was also extremely nice. There was a couple from out of town that had located the restaurant online and thought to give something off the strip a try. The owner took the time to recommend some excellent things to do while they were in town. I thought it was great how he makes everyone feel so welcome and takes the time to make sure everything is perfect with your meal. 

Good food, good service, good price, can't beat that."}
{"text":"My breakfast was fresh an incredible. Eggs cooked perfect,home fries so good, and gravy for cf steak was killer! Can't forget about the extremely friendly and helpful servers."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, owner is great and very friendly. Highly recommended. We come here often even to bring clients and family members"}
{"text":"Probably the best service I have ever received. I felt so welcomed as soon as I walked through the doors. The staff were all super friendly and attentive. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"Just had a breakfast wrap at Mr. Mamas, first time eating there, food was amazing, hot, fresh and fast to the table.    The staff said it was a new location, atmosphere was ok, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome! We eat breakfast here every time we are in Vegas. For $6.95, you can get two eggs and two large pancakes that are the very best. The cheese omelet with hash browns and toast is only $7.95! Very friendly owner and staff.  Worth the visit"}
{"text":"Food was great. Loved their version of country fried steak. Service was by far \"wonderful\". Loved it"}
{"text":"This is very off the strip a good 10-15 minutes from LV BLVD.  Its a nice family type place.  The food is good and the staff are very attentive once you come in the door.  The portions are reasonable for the $$ and they don't rush you out the door.  The homemade corn beef hash is good and the one pancake is enough to share for two people.  Will be going back..."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE IS AWESOME !!! THE FOOD IS SO GOOD !! 
First time here def will return !! The price is reasonable coffee lover and their coffee is bomb !"}
{"text":"This was like walking into my Kitchen ! - Nick & Kat greeted us and we had the best seat in the house. The food selection was excellent . When the meals were served, the presentation was as good as it gets ! I asked for the \"Best Breakfast in Las Vegas\" and I got it !
Thanks"}
{"text":"I am glad I found this place. The staff was friendly from the moment I walked in. I recommend the French toast!"}
{"text":"We loved seeing how much this place has grown since the last time we were in town (2013). The food's still wonderful, and it's definitely busy with locals who enjoy the food! We look forward to stopping by the next time we're in town"}
{"text":"Looking for a breakfast/brunch place that was out of the normal (IHOP, Denny's, Coco's, Casino Cafe's, etc). A good friend told us about Mr. Mamas. 
Upon arrival the crowds await! It being a Sunday & 4th of July weekend there was a wait. We made the choice to wait 35 minutes. I have to say it was worth the wait! 
The staff was very friendly made us feel welcome & personable from the moment we walked in until the very end when we left. They all worked together helping each other out. A+.
The server was very helpful she introduced the daily specials plus the popular items. The menu has quite the variety to choose from.
Started off with a Cinnamon Roll that we all shared. That was good! A nice starter. 
I ordered the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak with that O so Yummy Country Gravy, over hard eggs & home fries with sourdough toast! I enjoyed my meal very much. Didn't want it to end. 
My friends ordered Mamas stack (bacon & eggs), homemade pancakes, Mamas Burger with onion rings & Greek Omelette. They all enjoyed their meals & were very happy.

I will soon be back. Definitely a must try. They get pretty busy but it's surely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I think me and my boyfriend have found our new favorite brunch location!!! We usually do Biscuits which is not bad the coffee is great, but we like to explore. It was our first time there and the line was crazy. We almost left, however, I insisted on waiting. Before we knew it we were next!!! Do not be insulted by the name yelling it is a small lot so people tend to stray while waiting. I always get french toast and this ocassion was no different. We also decided to get the chicken fried steak with their gravy and homestyle potatoes. Let me just tell you.... WOW!!! The gravy is amazing and the chicken was amazingly crispy!!! That is definitely something you don't get often!!! The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and paired deliciously with the eggs (scrambled). I was sad that I had to ask for butter on my french toast since usually it is melted on top. I waited a while so they were cold so unfortunately I did not get the best flavor, but they were still delicious. Cannot wait to try more things on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the friendly people. Gotta try the pancakes. Delicious. Had the Mamas French toast and egg combo. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Another fabulous find in Vegas!  I had an egg white scramble with hash browns, my son had the French toast breakfast and my husband had the pancake breakfast.  Everything was great!  Everyone was so friendly and our order came out timely and perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here before leaving vegas on a Monday morning. Great breakfast. I had the Cali omelet. The aren't reinventing the wheel with breakfast just doing it right. Service is spectacular. They welcome you coming and going at the door and waitress jasmine was very prompt and friendly. Visitors should get off the strip for a afford great meal!"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic breakfast here. Their French toast was very tasty as well. And the country gravy was the best."}
{"text":"My Wife and I were heading out for a Motorcycle ride, but wanted to fuel up with Breakfast before heading out.  Searching for a good breakfast place Mr. Mamas came up with high reviews and was real close to where I was renting my bike.
As soon as we parked the bike and started heading for the entrance, the doors opened up and we were welcomed in and immediately seated.
Everyone was very friendly and engaging, obviously knowing we were heading for a ride (Harley gear gave us away) we talked quite a bit about our upcoming adventure with (I assume) the owner. We truly felt like we were part of the family

I ordered Mamas Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs (my favorite breakfast) and my wife had Eggs Benedict.  The Chicken Fried Steak was one of the best I ever had, and the home made gravy was excellent.  My wife too was thoroughly impressed with her breakfast as well.  

This was a perfect start to our day!!  We liked them so much we cam back the next morning before returning our motorcycle to the rental place.  Next time we're in Vegas, we plan on going back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Staff were nice and friendly.  The owner always walks around to make sure that everything is OK.  

We ordered an omlette and a pancake for two of us.  My server was kind to split it for us.  The portion was big, I can't finish my half.  My coffee was always filled up as well as my husband's tea.  Everything tasted great, so we were pleased.

The price was so affordable, so we went back for breakfast everyday while we stayed in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time visiting for me, second time for my husband. Food was terrific. The French toast was perfectly cooked, the corned beef hash was homemade and had a nice crust, as did the hash browns. 
The only reason I subtracted a star is because the service was slow. It was about 7am, there were only 4 tables occupied, but we had to flag another server down for a coffee refill twice. Our server only checked back with us immediately after the meal was served and then was very distracted talking to other servers and being on the phone. Never spoke with her again until after we sat for about 10 minutes with our plates empty in front of us, then we were able to request the check. Because this is one big dining room, she could easily have seen our situation. 
We will definitely be back, and in all fairness, I'll update my review at that time. This could have just been an unusual day. Still, I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food was delicious, service was great and Mr. Mama, himself, came around and introduced himself to every table and tried to get to know where his customers were coming from. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Super good food. Very affordable and the staff is amazing!! Super attentive and the home fries are the absolute best!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  Prices are great and atmosphere is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Wow! This was the best breakfast experience I've had in a long time. Customer service was top notch. Our server Lourdes was incredibly friendly and had great attention to detail. We ordered omelettes with a few modifications and everything came out perfect. Food was delicious. Portions were huge. We are so glad we chose Mr. Mamas over a typical Vegas buffet."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! Had the French toast with eggs and my GOD my mouth was in heaven I will compare everything to this place. And the service is everything everyone is saying on here spectacular! Doors opened for us, really kind, spacious, and needs met in amazing time."}
{"text":"Food 4.5
Value 5
Customer service and friendliness 5
Cleanliness 4.5

Total 5 rounded up"}
{"text":"This place is as good as every one says... excellent food and excellent service. You can't go wrong! We used the yelp app and the $15.00 deal... it's a no brainer"}
{"text":"So .. It's 6:45 am and I'm HUNGRY! What is open now?!? Hey I've been wanting to try Mr. Mamas and they open at 7am. Perfect! As soon as my husband and I walked in we were greeted very warmly and told to sit anywhere we like. Right away I liked the feel of the place ( homey, clean and welcoming. ) we looked over the menu and I really like the fact you can have breakfast or lunch or both! I had a strange craving for chili at this hour but I wanted blueberry pancakes too.. Wtf why not both? Lol blueberry not on the menu but the will make it for you ( fresh plump blueberries too). Got short stack (2 huge) and side of bacon ( 3 thick and perfectly crisp) husband got chicken fried steak ( which he said was delicious ) and we shared a bowl of chili with the works. Everything came out so fast fresh and delicious. The service was exceptional and the owner even came around to each table to make sure all was well. I rarely give 5 stars but this place is doing it right. Can't wait to try other items on the menu. Try this place .. You and your tummy will leave happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Service is perfection! EVERYONE is so welcoming from the moment you walk thru the door! 

The food was so tasty I got the Greek omelette and my boyfriend got the chicken fried steak and eggs YUMMY!!! we also got the French toast, best French toast EVER! 

The owner was so nice he personally greeted everyone at their tables and since we were in town for the week he gave us some suggestions on where to go for dinner and drinks. 

This is our new breakfast spot in Las Vegas! What a great experience thank you Mr. Mamas every restaurant needs to come here and take notes on how to run their business."}
{"text":"Food was great my wife ordered the vegi omelet and it was perfect. I had the steak and eggs breakfast and it was delicious i will visit this place when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Second time in 2 days eating here. Great staff. Really good food. Filling and huge portions. Way worth it."}
{"text":"Friendliest place around!!  The whole staff worked together and everyone was so helpful. Excellent hashbrowns and large portions. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Most delightful establishment. Amazingly friendly staff, absolutely scrumptious food, and such a positive vibe. Chicken Fried Steak and the Mamas Burger is out of this world delicious! The ranch dressing is to die for, just trust me. Kat the manager is the sweetest. The best dining experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here while in town for annual B2V run. Once again YELP came through. Even though we stayed at one the local casinos, we always look for local fare. Great food and service. Recommend the chicken fried steak and eggs. They even custom mixed my juice, 50/50 OJ & cranberry!"}
{"text":"Great service! This place delivers all the essential breakfast items at a reasonable price just a short distance from the strip. Not a fancy place, very simple actually, but the thing that stood out the most was how much they care about their customers. I would have added a 5th star if they had a larger menu to offer. The smaller menu keeps things less complicated and flowing smoothly in there and that I can appreciate."}
{"text":"I didn't expected but it was great! Fast and nice service with really great coffee!! If I go to this area again, I'll visit here for coffee, again!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. Can't go wrong with this place! We ordered the Steak & Eggs with house fries and toast... Eggs Benedict with bacon... Corn beef hash... Sausage, biscuits n gravy, Greek salad & last but not least French toast. There were a few of us!  ALL of what we ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"Before we left Las Vegas to head back home we stopped at this location. Be ready for an absolute journey of what customer service and food should be. You first walk into the door to be greeted with wide open arms as if you have been here 1000 times. Once seated and order placed a slice of heaven is delivered on every plate. I ordered the Mr. Mamas French toast and it was the best I've ever tasted. The perfect amount o cinnamon and powdered sugar in every bite. We also ordered the three meat omelet that had no crumbs left over and home fries that were perfection. I am not shocked that this location has a near perfect score because they truly are PERFECT! Keep up the great service."}
{"text":"Don't come to this place.

I was excited to try this place as it has some good reviews. I live 5 min away, and heard about it. 

We entered and waited 20 min to be seated. 
I asked the host how much longer will the wait be, and instead of him being polite, he said we should be patient and that we should wait more.
I asked him how many people are in front of us and he started getting irritated and angry.

The people I was with said the wait is too long. Some got there before me and waited even longer.

The host came back and instead of saying something nice became super rude and then he said they are not going to seat us and that they refuse us service. 

This is the worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas and I've lived here for 10 years now.

Not to mention the place looks horrible inside.
It smelled bad and the tables and chairs are the old and cheap ones. 

I can't comment on the food as we didn't try it. But the service is not something you would wanna experience, or at least the service we got from the host. That guy should be fired.

Stay away."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, exceptional service - what are you waiting for?!? Next time I gotta get the pancakes!"}
{"text":"We  found this place through Yelp.  We had the mamas French toast and Western omelet. It's was delicious. Service was great. Just a little wait because it was a hoppin place."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and the nicest staff I've encountered in a long time! Diner style, a relief from the Strip."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly atmosphere, the owner even participates and greets everyone. Some items, he'll even give you the back story of, which always makes my meal feel extra special. Love coming here and would recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"20 minute wait but once we were in, good coffee, good omelets, good hash browns, good cinnamon buns, good bacon.  The prices were about the same as other breakfast places but the portions were about a third larger. Next time I'm in the area and have 20 minutes to wait around I'm going to try their lunch foods, they looked good too."}
{"text":"Solid little diner. Super friendly staff. Good food good prices made to order. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! We are not from the area and Yelped somewhere to eat and came across this place. It did not disappoint. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As many Yelpers have pointed out, the food here  lacks seasoning, is bland and several items are frozen.  This was the case with our food, as well.  The layout of the restaurant is awkward.   Many tables are right next to wait stations or the bathrooms, which is very uncomfortable.  When we asked not to be seated by the restroom, it was a MAJOR issue with management.   The wait staff is slow and inattentive.  They spend their time chit-chatting with each other and on cell phones.  Management spends its  time running around taking pictures for the website instead of respecting the customers and leaving them alone to eat.  We tried  more than once to patronize this restaurant in order to support a local business, but each time was the same.  After attempting one last time to see if things had improved, we were actually told we were not welcome back to the restaurant!!  As if WE did something!!   What it boils down to is this was in direct response to us posting a negative review.  Why don't you listen to all the negatives reviews, Nick, and fix the problems instead of trying to deflect?  You have lost a tremendous number of customers who will no longer patronize your restaurant due to your treatment of my mom and I.  They tell 2 friends....  they tell 2 friends..."}
{"text":"The service is amazing! They're super friendly from the minute you walk in to the moment you leave. I had the steak and eggs and it was great. Even the toast was tasty. There's so many things I wanna try on the menu.  Love this place and hope to come back again in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of those breakfast joint that you kept looking at your wrist watch to check the time on those mornings you got up unexpectedly early, haha.

It is your basic American pancake and egg place, but you get excellent service, a friendly manager or owner that circulates among the diners constantly, OK coffee, and inexpensive $10 ~ $12 per person; whereas the same menu items at the Aria Cafe would have doubled your bill easily.  Relative easy parking in a strip mall (the previous location was much worse) and this place opens at 6:00a and gets busy quickly.

Good family value."}
{"text":"This is a very nicely kept clean restaurant that serves good wholesome food. The owner is very personable and the staff and service is great. I enjoy eating breakfast here whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service, Great food. You may need to wait but totally worth it. I tried the Mama's short stack, puffy pancakes with eggs and sausage, good stuff. We also ordered a side of hash browns also pretty good. Excellent value will come back for sure. The place is simple but clean and the staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast selections. You have choices from small servings to big portions. You can also do add ons, which is always good. It's like creating your own breakfast menu. Oh, and service was top notch. Will definitely go back plus it's just around the corner where we live."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is a phenomenal establishment. Excellent service, great food, and fair pricing. So happy I ended my stay here"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast .... 3rd visit and every time very pleased with service and food.
Eggs, pancakes, potatoes you name it .... Made how u want! Wanna add peppers and onions ? How about chocolate chips or blueberries.... You name it, if they have it they will add it!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, and great food! Will definitely come back here! It's off the strip, but so worth the 15min cab ride. The staff is incredibly welcoming and professional!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and owner, diner atmosphere with good breakfast food.  Daily specials.  Busy, so could have a wait.  

I had French toast - thick slices of bread and lots of cinnamon with scrambled (real) eggs.  Definitely order again!

Hubby got eggs, bacon, sliced tomatoes and subbed in strawberry pancake with fresh berries.  All good!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the YUMMY, FLUFFY PANCAKES!!  Yelp for the win!  10 of us out of town for dance competition and needed some comfort food!  Wait was about 45 minutes, but once we were seated we had our food very quick!  Not sure how you're a \"Mr. Mama\", but it doesn't matter because he or she is excellent in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"After reading wonderful reviews, my husband and I drove from the Orleans for breakfast. We were greeted at the door and were seated after a very short wait. Our drink orders were taken quickly while we looked over the menu.  The restaurant seemed very clean and all of those who worked there were cheerful. We both chose Mama's short stack--two eggs, bacon, and two pancakes for $7.95.  Eggs and bacon were prepared just as we requested and the pancakes were wonderful--very light and fluffy.  We will return."}
{"text":"Service 5 stars - 

...as soon as we pulled into the parking lot, employees were tentative to our presence, opening and holding doors, greeting us with smiles as we were being seated. Our waitress Lourdes introduced herself and made sure all our needs were taken care of. Upon leaving, the owner thanked us, apologized for the wait (waited 2 mins for them to pull tables together), and shook our hands. 

Food 5 stars -

If you have a big appetite,  order the Mama's stack! Generous amount of food, tasty and decent price!"}
{"text":"Nestled in a strip mall, you'd never assume Mr Mamas was such a breakfast institution and one of the top rated yelp restaurants in the nation! 

Nothing but big portions, solid/friendly service, quality ingredients and taste, budget friendly prices, and overall great dining experience. Expect long lines and a wait but that comes with the territory of being a local favorite combined with tourist attraction.

I really appreciated the all around terrific service we received. Multiple servers attended to our large group of 8 people. When we tried taking a group photo, a gentlemen (maybe the manager?) stepped up and offered to take it for us. He stood on a chair to get an aerial view so it would capture not only our large group, but all the food on the table. Kudos for going the extra mile.

Food portions are GENEROUS. Omelettes contain 4 eggs!! :O Your doctor may not like your cholesterol levels afterwards but your wallet and tummy sure will. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the menu items. Mr Mamas takes great care in preparing dishes that don't skimp on ingredients. 

Overall this is a very solid breakfast spot that won't let you down. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the menu offerings are largely your standard to-be-expected type of dishes. There isn't anything \"unique\" or \"special\" per se. You go to Mr Mamas for traditional fare in a friendly and welcoming environment. You don't go for a gourmet experience. And that's just fine with me. :)"}
{"text":"Meh. It's a breakfast/lunch diner. Food was as to be expected. Definitely not bad. Just not memorable. My family ate there a week ago and I can't remember what we had. The owner, however, is wonderful. Very charismatic, greets every diner. Makes you feel very welcomed. Staff was also attentive. If you like the menu and are nearby, definitely come. But if you want something truly memorable, have the coffee cake at the Cracked Egg (...if you like chocolate.)"}
{"text":"Best Diner in Vegas. Large portions, great food, and super friendly staff. I finally got tired of being dissapointed with Ihop every 2 months or so when I need an all-out breakfast. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Have the breakfast burrito! It is enough for two & has everything (eggs, potatoes, sausages & cheese)! It is a meal in itself! Love the ample parking & the super friendly host. A good place for breakfast on a Sunday. Be prepared for a wait, but so worth it! Oh, yeah, don't forget the cinnamon rolls, made here everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! We waited about 20 minutes as a party of 8. The meal portions were huge! My son couldn't finish 3 pancakes because of the size. The prices were reasonable as well. Felt like home. The owner came out to check in on everyone in the diner. Overall great customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!

Food is just average though. Prices are a little over the top for me.

I ordered the steak & eggs and liked it but thought it was a little lacking for the price. Hubby ordered pancakes and those were delicious! The perfect fluff. Wasn't a huge fan of the cinnamon roll. It was a little dry for me.

If you're in the area, try this place! Wait is long sometimes, but the service definitely makes it worth it."}
{"text":"We just had Mr.Mama's for the first time and it was great. The Greek side salad was much bigger than expected . My salad and side of chilli  were both  very good. My  husband  had the Jenna's wrap and said it was also very good and  was very filling.   I was very pleased with our server ,probably one of the best  we have had in years!  I would go back, too bad we were just travelling through!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! This is one of my go to breakfast spots in Las Vegas. Yes the wait is typically long but it is sooo worth it. The staff is friendly and great, the food is excellent and the eggs Benedict is the best in town! If you are a pancake lover, they are huge here and super delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Got seated quickly.  Great staff and service.  Highly recommend steak and eggs!"}
{"text":"It's always good. They use very fresh ingredients. Big fan of the omelets, the tuna, and the salads. The beef soup is not too great, but it might be me. Only suggestion I have is that they need to strip and wax their tile floors, they look dirty. I only notice because I used to do that type of work about 20 years ago so I always look at floors now."}
{"text":"I ordered from them once and I was extremely taken back when I received a call from the owner or manager (honestly I am not sure who) and they told me that the tip I left was not big enough for the delivery person. Horrible customer service, I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"We picked this place for breakfast due to the high rating. We found it to be ok, but not worthy of 4.5 stars. It's very average quality food, but priced fair and a pretty good wait staff. If you're looking for a cheap meal around the same quality as large chain restaurants then it's a good place to go. If you're looking for a really great quality breakfast or lunch then I'd recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I started going here when they were on Decatur.  We loved it, but it would get so crowded we kind of stopped.  One day we drove by and saw it was gone, which was surprising because of how great it was and how busy.  I ended up calling and found out they had moved.  It is a bigger place now, which is nice, and the same amazing food and service!  Great burgers, breakfasts and even salads."}
{"text":"Awesome service great food! Me Mamma treated us like guests in his home. 

Thanks Nick!"}
{"text":"Great service from everyone. Family oriented. The food was good too. Not amazing but good. Would return for the great service"}
{"text":"We went here this morning for a very casual birthday brunch with just the three of us, and it did not disappoint.

I have read about how highly this place was rated, but I was skeptical. It was not until they offered the yelp deal that I made the leap. I can make breakfast at home, so why should I come here to pay for it? I now understand why. 

First of all, the service was incredible. We arrived around 11 am expecting to wait, but there was no wait, and we were quickly seated. The staff was friendly, quick, informative, and more than willing to help. It's so rare to find a place where people just ooze top quality service, especially at these prices. 

The pricing really is phenomenal. You can eat lunch here for just about $10 including tip. 

We tried the cinnamon roll to start, and it did not disappoint. It was warm and fresh and oh so fluffy. It was a great way to start the day. 

The biscuits were top notch. Fluffiness seems to be a theme here, and I appreciated how fresh these biscuits were. 

I also did not understand the hype over the hash browns, but now I do. They came to the table incredibly hot and well seasoned. They weren't too crispy, which is perfect for me. 

The pancakes were pretty good. They were tough to cut, but the flavor was strong and traditional. 

The reuben sandwich was very well received at our table, which is certainly saying something when a place is known for breakfast, and our reuben aficionado can be picky. 

We will definitely be back. This warm, neighborhood restaurant is truly top quality."}
{"text":"We are in from out of state. Daughter brought us here for breakfast. Outstanding service. Very polite and helpful server. Attended-to as if our opinion and satisfaction really matter. Definitely will return here during our next visit."}
{"text":"You must eat here...The food is amazing and the service is exceptional! Make sure you get the french toast! I will be eating here again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I choose this place specifically from the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. There was a small wait but only about 10 minutes. The staff was friendly and portion sizes where very large. The fresh OJ was delish! It was very affordable. I ate one of the wraps and my friend had the ginormous pancakes. I would definitely recommend. It is a diner set up so if you are looking for a hipster place, it is not where to go."}
{"text":"Basics done right and right on time. We had a party of five and food came out quick for 10:00 Sunday. They got a system going here. Service nice. Coffee good. A great breakfast place cuz they got fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"I was not so excited about the food I had pancakes and they were tough and they weren't flavorful and also they did not have half and half for the coffee not so good with all these reviews"}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. Had the chicken fried steak. I'm not usually a fan of chicken fried steak, but somehow got the urge to order it here. It did not disappoint. Crispy steak and a unique sausage (and bacon?) gravy that had a sweetness to it.  Ordered the hash browns crispy. Probably didn't need the toast that came with it. The scrambled eggs needed to be cooked in salted butter (they were missing that buttery taste). Lots of other things on the menu that looked good too. Long wait, but worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome service. If you are a restaurant owner whose business is not growing, come to Mr. Mamas and enjoy breakfast or lunch and you will learn so much about what true customer service looks like! Kudos to management and keep up the good work. You definitely earned my business!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but the customer service was the best I've ever had. The owner Nick came and talked to us he was a very cool guy. This was the best breakfast ever"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best breakfast places I've been to.  In Vegas or anywhere...  Came Saturday, day before Easter around 10:30 am. Yes, there was a line outside. 

Outside - fairly new building. Check out my photo from the parking lot.  

Sign-in - the  Dude (I forget his name), said about a 45 minute wait.  I thought - well,  if Yelpers say it's 4.5 stars,  it's got to be worth the wait.  So wait we shall.

25 minutes later, my party already had our table.  Yay!

Atmosphere - I love the checkerboard floors that make it seem like you're in a diner, but with a truly open floor plan.  You see everyone.  There's no hiding inside Mr. Mama's, so anyone fooling around in Vegas will probably avoid this place.  Hahaha, and that's one of the reasons I love it.  Even with all the noise, it's all good.  It's exciting seeing what everyone else got, too.  Makes you more hungry. 

Food - OMG!  I got the Mama's Stack which comes with 3 pancakes.  Everything on that plate was awesome.  My tween son had the Spanish omelette. I didn't try it, but what I did try was the french fries on his plate.  They're so cute cubed up that all that time i thought they were hash browns. And they tasted sooo good.. 

Service - very impressed.  Even though it was a packed house,  food came in out in 15 minutes tops. And not just us, seems everyone else too.  Our server, gal that looks like Selena Gomez, was very friendly and attentive.  She checked on us every 5 minutes.  Kat, the  manager, circled around checking on everyone.  Seriously, I don't think I've ever gotten that kind of attention from a breakfast joint anywhere.  

My only complaint, which I shared with Kat - was the fact that they have only 2 restroom stalls, a men and a women.  Since this place looks like it's going to be or continue to be the next big thing in Vegas, we should have at least 2 stalls for each sex, in case one gets tied down.  And you know that happens...  

Lastly, my only hope is that they do not grow too big.  Meaning they don't make too many locations.  Keep it original and stay as is.  Don't oversaturate the market.  Give me a reason to go to this one location for a while."}
{"text":"So we came here after reading all the reviews on yelp. I must say we waited a long time as a family of 5 but Mr Mamas did not disappoint! The prices were phenomenal, portions huge, delicious food, and great service. I'm so happy we stopped and had brunch. My husband had steak and eggs, while I had the country fried steak. We both had a pancake on the side. The pancakes are as big as a regular sized dinner plate, they are buttery fluffy and filling. Eating brunch here kept us full for the day. I ordered a big breakfast of 3 pancakes, 3 eggs, and bacon for my kids and was able to easily split it 3 ways and they had leftovers. My country fried steak hit the spot as I was missing living in the NC at the moment. We will be dinning here again if we stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Based just off service, we waited about 20 mins for a table on a 3 day weekend end. Not bad! We looked at the menu before we were seated to be ready to order. You tell the waitress yo are ready to order and she says just a minute. You hear your waitress complaining about work  more than once, while you are STILL waiting to to take your order. Not returning here...."}
{"text":"This is a great place to feel at home and enjoy the best food in Vegas.
The owner is a real nice guy that met us at the door and recognizes you if your a repeat visitor. The best Corn Beef in town in my opinion, I drive 25 miles from the other side of town to have a Ruben from Mr Mamas.
The new location is very nice with plenty of seating, I only wish they were open for Dinner."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times were great! The service was prompt and the staff was very pleasant. 

I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. Superb!!! The manager stopped by our table to check up on us and she informed us how the corned beef is made in house and cooked for 10 hours! I also got the hash browns and you can tell it is definitely fresh, not frozen. Everything they serve is fresh and cooked to perfection. Will definitely be my go-to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  The line is long so I would always recommend getting there early.  The food was great and the staff was very helpful and polite.  The cinnamon roll is a must.  Have it first or have it last...either way u need to get it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after my flight with the family and it's really great. Very comfy home feel and friendly customer service while being professional. They really make you feel welcomed. Their gravy is bomb and the country fried steak is delicious. Wish I took pictures of the food but I dove right in. Shoutouts to  Sean and our sweet lady server !"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. We had the Cali omelet and the breakfast burrito, and both were delicious! The hash browns, pico de gallo, and salsa were great too! Very reasonably priced and worth the ride from the strip."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast choice with good food and a very friendly staff. 

I had one of the specials: pulled pork benedict. The hollandaise was delicious, exactly lemony enough and the eggs were perfectly poached. The hashbrowns that came with them were great as well - golden brown and crispy. 

The staff was great too, swinging the doors wide open for us like we were royalty when we walked up and they were very friendly and attentive. 

If you want some classic American breakfast then I would definitely recommend Mr. Mamas."}
{"text":"The Jenna breakfast burrito was so good I may order one to go!! Honestly amazing. I ordered a cinnamon roll for dessert. The wait fir a table is worth it. The food comes quick."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this locals place, constant people in and out, very friendly staff, great service and the food was great.  Worth the drive from the Strip."}
{"text":"Pros: Great food, great value, great service, large menu

Cons: It can get busy (not really a con)

Details: This is one of my favorite brunch places in town. It gets busy because it is so good, so expect a bit of a wait during peak hours. That said, the service is fast and you get your food quick. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I really like the food, lots of options with mostly American breakfast and lunch items. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Mr Mamas for a nice diner breakfast. I was totally craving one morning a Jersey-style diner experience. In terms of the food, Mr Mamas fits the bill - no frills, no nonsense, down-to-earth breakfast comfort food. Pancakes were huuuuuuge, fluffy and yummy. Seriously, no complaints about the food here.

I was, however, disappointed with the service, which I expected to be spectacular given all the prior raving reviews. We were seated right away, but then basically ignored for the next 10-16 minutes. Ten minutes passed, and we attempted (and succeeded on our third try) to wave down a waiter. We asked if we could order since no one has come by our table yet. His asked us who our waiter was, which from our perspective was an odd thing to ask because had we known that, we wouldn't have stopped him. We said that we didn't know since literally no one has come by to greet us, or give us water or take a drink order. \"Well I don't know who is taking care of your table today, you need to ask the person who is responsible for your table\" was his answer before he walked off. I get it, he was a young server and maybe did not know any better, but then we tried waving down someone else and 2-3 times we were either rebuffed or outrightly ignored. My mother commented that she saw someone by the cashier acknowledge her (a manager, perhaps?) by nodding and waving in her direction that he would get to her shortly, but another 10 minutes passed and he never did. 

Our waitress finally came around the 20-minute mark, but the damage was done. My parents, who rarely dined out, felt ignored and unhappy with the experience. My hubby, who needed to be back on the Strip within a certain time for business, asked the waitress typically how long it takes for food to get out. Her answer was that she \"didn't know\" - apparently a popular refrain. Just because a place in Vegas serves and looks like a Jersey diner, doesn't mean it operates with the efficiency of a Jersey diner - lesson learned for this naive tourist.

I wouldn't mind coming back here again and giving it another shot, but doubt i will return since my family was unhappy with the treatment. Unfortunate, because the food was very decent and prices fair."}
{"text":"I got the breakfast burrito. It was massive but not impressive in taste. I felt a little short changed on my extra avocado portion."}
{"text":"No frills diner-type food (just missing the booths). Good food, great service and prices!"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast place! Came here on a Sunday morning after church, around 8:45; there were a few families there, but not too busy just yet. It started getting packed with a waiting list around 10am.

The staff was friendly and kept on checking on us periodically. We had ordered a traditional eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon with a side of hash browns and Chicken fried steak with a side of hash browns and toast. The eggs Benedict was delicious; the English muffin was toasted to perfection and was a great contrast to the poached egg and the creaminess of the yolk and the hollandaise. The Canadian bacon added the bit of saltiness and extra bite the dish needed. For the CFS, it was phenomenal. The steak was tender and juicy, while still being crispy. The country gravy was filled with sausage and a hint of maple syrup, adding a great flavor to the already flavorful steak. The hash browns that accompanied both dishes were very crispy and well prepared as well.

Overall, great experience and one of the better breakfast places in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The food was delicious, the service was outstanding,welcoming and very attentive. The owner nick is so kind and friendly as was the entire staff. Denise and Twan were our servers and they were both so very attentive and quick, our cups were never empty:) I will definitely visit this place again and again. A great dining experience at an amazingly affordable price."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and great coffee!

We came to Mr. Mama's because we saw it's voted #1 breakfast place on Trip Advisor. We liked it. I give 4.5 out of 5. 

The coffee is some of the best we've had at a restaurant. It's got a good kick and they kept it coming. You can have options like mocha and other things if you want. 

We opted for the eggs Florentine and the Mr. Mama's Favorite Chicken Fried steak. Both were good with distinct flavors and crispy potatoes. We had the hash browns and the home fries. The portions are huge and we took food home. 

The whole staff is super friendly and very proactive in making sure we had everything we needed. The manager even offered us To Go coffee or water. 

I knocked off a half a star because it was loud in the place and, interestingly, the poached egg on the chicken fried steak order was cold. But we'll be back. I want to try their ginormous pancakes."}
{"text":"The owner personally opens the door for you before you get inside. As soon as this happened, I knew their service was going to be great (and it was)! Not only was the service exceptional - their food was also fairly priced and delicious! I would definitely recommend this place. It's only about a 10 min drive from the Strip."}
{"text":"Excellent standard breakfast fare. They have short order cooks & attentive wait staff. Food was fresh & not over greased. It's not a fancy establishment, but it gets the job done at the right price."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a few of my vendors. Tasty Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and a side Beef Soup aka dipping sauce... Waitress was very nice as well. We will be back to try a few more items on the menu.."}
{"text":"In this day and age ABOVE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE is rare. We experienced it here ! ! Don't leave Las Vegas without patronizing Mr. Mama's. Good food too !"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, you name it! Not only is every dish so perfectly delicious, but the way you are treated in there is priceless. The owners are always there and they are super friendly and care about their restaurant. You can tell that they love what they do and they love to make their customers happy! My husband and I always go to Vegas every year and there isn't a time we haven't stopped by Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast place.  Mr Mamas reviews looked good so off we went.  If you're staying on the Strip, it's a good drive to Mr. Mamas.  

Once there, you;re warmly greeted and the door is held open for you.  Who does that anymore?  Server came right away asking for coffee or drinks.  Menu has a good selection so we opted to share an omelet.  The omelet and hash browns were OK, nothing spectacular.  Prices are reasonable.  But what sets Mr Mamas apart is their great service."}
{"text":"This place was great in all aspects. Upon our arrival, nearly every employee greeted us. I knew they had good service by the wait time for a table but every few minutes or so they would assure us how much longer we'd have to wait and offered us a beverage. Soon after we were seated I totally forgot how long we waited becuz the food was so good and served smoking. Shawn was really informative as to what he recommend us to order and other eateries to visit throughout the day. I'm so happy we ate here and have so many good things to write about this place that I'd run out of time and space to write, so my final words are \"you won't go wrong here if you  follow your taste buds\""}
{"text":"I found this place randomly on an app and saw its Yelp reviews so decided to give it a try. It was amazing! Super friendly and attentive staff. Our food was out really quick and tasted fantastic! I've had such a hard time finding a place with good biscuits and gravy so I decided to only order a half to share with my husband because I was sure I wouldn't like it, however I ate the whole thing and then what I ordered! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're a brekkie person then you have to make an effort eat here. 

The owner Nick is such a personal guy, he has such interesting Greek family history and told us how the restaurant got its name. You have to loved a guy who comes to your table to thank you for coming to eat at his restaurant, really makes you feel at home and welcome. 

Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with their homemade sausage gravy and a biscuit instead of toast. You have to bring a good appetite to polish off this order. Great gravy with a little kick, the Chicken Fried Steak was crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside.

I finally can take Mr. Mama's off my LV Bookmark Brekkie list,I'm happy that I drove all the way here. Hey you have to support local businesses that have this kind of passion. 

Mr. Mama's is located in the Spanish Palms Plaza on S.Jones Blvd between W.Hacienda Ave. and W.Russell Rd."}
{"text":"From the time you arrive it's non-stop service! The door was opened and a personal greeting was rendered. Followed by prompt seating and an attentive staff. The food was made in a good amount of time and served in large portions. I couldn't finish it all. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the involvement of the owner (Mr. Mama) in the dining experience and overall satisfaction of the customers. He greeted everyone and even engaged in a few conversations. I will definitely visit again. If personal service with a positive attitude is what you seek in a dining experience, I urge you to give Mr. Mamas a try."}
{"text":"Excellent service good food and best burger ive ever had if your in the area you gotta try mr mama's onion rings are on point and the mama burger is a must try no questions asked mr mama's is where its at."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! A group of 5 of us went during breakfast/brunch time, and we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. I think they could tell that we were ravenous (and hungover) because the servers were incredibly gracious and efficient with our orders. Everything tasted (and looked, if that matters to you!) fantastic. It was a lovely way to end a fun trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"As always, superb food and service. Every employee here goes out of his/her way to be friendly and helpful. This day we came in with a made-for-twins stroller. When the manager noticed that our infants were waiting outside, he made room so that they could wait inside to keep them from the outside warm air. Kudos to the entire staff l"}
{"text":"Unmatched, EXCELLENT customer service, with some of the most DELICIOUS breakfast and lunch around. The pricing is very appropriate and INEXPENSIVE.

I have been here twice on two separate Vegas trips and the customer service has been some of the best I've ever experienced, BOTH TIMES.

We walked up to the door, and were happily greeted by an employee who held the door open for us and welcomed us as we entered. The cashier then smiled and said good morning as we were directed to another employee waving at us from our awaiting table. Our server, Jacqui, greeted us within a minute, and took our orders with a smile. 

The food took about 10 minutes to come out and about 10 minutes later, I was a very happy, very full customer. They promptly kept the table clear of empty plates, and Jenna asked if we wanted water to go as we left.

My personal favorite:
The Greek Omelette is on point! 4 eggs, hash browns, a large, free pancake on the side, and all of it delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was totally awesome. Super friendly staff as we joked around with them. I Had the Cali Omelette and my wife had the chicken fried steak. WE WILL EAT HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to give this place a great review. We were in town for spring break and picked this place from all the amazing reviews it had here on yelp. I love finding places off the beaten path that are surprisingly good and unique. This place is neither of these. The food was mediocre at best and I wasn't impressed with the service. I really wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt but I really couldn't. 

I ordered the biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were burnt and the gravy was so congealed and cold it was like eating a chunk of lard over store-bought biscuits. I do have to admit that it was a good try but kind of missed the mark.

My wife and kids ordered pancakes and bacon with eggs. The pancakes were decent but nothing special. They are literally in love with bacon but none of them could finish their bacon because it was burnt so crisp it was inedible. 

I really am sorry to not be able to give them a higher rating but this is my honest review. If you want to give a new place a try then come but don't get your expectations too high."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was excellent, and fast. And the owner is very sweet, and you can tell he has so much passion for his restaurant. Although the wait can be a little long, it is totally worth it! Defiantly give it a try you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Ate here before leaving town. Amazing service from every employee, honest and helpful staff. Food was delicious and huge portions. Chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy were the best. Highly recommend, so much better than the strip choices and the price is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We were greeted by a friendly man and sat immediately. They were extremely prompt, which is perfect since we were on our lunch break. I had a sandwich made into a wrap, which was enough food for me to either stuff myself or save for later. My other half ordered a breakfast wrap which was equally delicious. I was so impressed by the timely service and warm environment. This place deserves all five stars. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a little breakfast joint off the strip in Las Vegas. The wait times are a little long on weekends but nothing out of the ordinary. They offer a selection of breakfast food that is pretty typical, eggs, bacon, burritos, pancakes etc. The food is not bad but its nothing special and the prices are kinda high. The first time I went it was pretty good, the second I was more disappointed. I ordered home fries and received what looked like pre frozen cubes of potato with no seasoning or flavor. Overall its so so, I doubt I will be coming back as I have found other places in Vegas with better food and cheaper prices. I have not tried lunch here so I do not know if its better."}
{"text":"Pass by this place & finally got a chance to check it out & grab a bite. A little over price but I guess that's the price you pay for eating out ."}
{"text":"My daughter and wanted to try some place new for breakfast other than IHOP , which was our go to breakfast spot in The NYC / NJ area .
Being new to the area we stumbled upon Mr Mamas on Google map . 

Glad we gave it a try , the food was very good , along with the service . 
Ive informed many of my friends about this restaurant , most have lived in Vegas for quite some time ( and knew nothing about this place ) ."}
{"text":"Had never been here before and a friend had just seen it on yelp decided to stop by and check it out . We were greeted as soon as we got to the door and seated right away it was semi busy but not to bad. Our waitress came right away took out drink orders and came back soon after to take our orders. I ordered the French toast with a side of strawberries. My friend got the chili omelette and my other friend got the pancakes and steak and eggs .four food arrived within 10 min all hot and fresh . My French toast was so good I didn't even need syrup my bacon was good perfect and I ate every last drop lol . My friend said the omelette was good and something he never seen and same with steak and eggs. All around a good breakfast spot and we will be back for sure. I have to add they were super friendly and gave great customer service !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, well priced and fantastic customer service. Had the short stack with eggs and ham."}
{"text":"Well the eggs melt in your mouth. The cinnamon roll was delicious!! But the customer service was the star if the show. Even after walking in 20 mins before closing they still went above and beyond. Food was not rushed out and they checked on us several times. After closing they even offered us a cup of coffee to go. After finding out they would have to brew a new pot we declined the offer.  They  insisted. This is true custom service. The likes we don't see in California. Great place to give your business to without a doubt."}
{"text":"This rating is for the food. The food was just OK. 
The service, however, was outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome service & food. The pancakes are huge! I had the half order of biscuits & gravy & added a pancake. They make their gravy with a little maple syrup. It was really good & the sausage was high quality (no chewy pieces). The waitress offered to give me a sample to make sure I would like it."}
{"text":"Love this place! We ventured off the strip to find this breakfast gem! Huge portions, great prices and such a friendly staff! We will
Be back on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place. On the outside it looks like it's gonna have a huge wait but even at its busiest time we waited about ten minutes. 

The food is good. I had the blackened steak(I think that's what it's called) and it had a bit too much seasoning which made it hard to enjoy the meat but I asked for very very rare and I got that so it's forgivable. 

This feels like a mom and pop place because the people here treat you like it's family breakfast. They seat quickly and the waitress we got topped our drinks without having to be asked. She frequently checked on us and made sure we were taken care of. It's not super pricey just watch out how many things you \"add on\" because it can get pricey . 

The customer service made me happy though. Very much recommend."}
{"text":"Can't complain! Everything was great from the moment we walked in. Staff and Food were great! Cool place! This is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast, the staff is more like family and the food is amazing every time. I go there so much they know who I am and always make me feel at home! It's definitely worth any wait ( the restaurant is on the small side so limited tables) so happy my parents showed me this place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast gem found thanks to yelp. We have been staying on the strip eating buffet after buffet, but this was a great way to end our stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Always a friendly, respectable environment. They provide great service every time I dine there. The owner is such a personable gentleman. 
The food taste great & highly recommend the cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and very friendly staff!  Quick service also.  One of the best breakfast places!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and service in Las Vegas! 3 mile drive from the strip but well worth it. Family owner diner with a very friendly staff. Food is excellent, prices are very reasonable...I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas was a great place to stop for breakfast. We went on a Monday morning and were sat right away. Our server was very friendly and because we had never been here she offered to let us try the gravy to see if we wanted to order any of the dishes that came with it. 

I had cranberry juice, two eggs and ham steak with toast and hash browns. Very nice sized portion and tasty. I finished most of it and we took the toast to go.

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak. He said it was a lot of food and couldn't finish but that it was delicious. 

Once again our server was very nice and she was attentive but not hovering which is perfect. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas.

Price : $27"}
{"text":"I'd give them a higher rating if it was solely based on the welcome that you get when you arrive. Mr. Mama opened the door and practically met us in the parking lot to tell us how happy he was to see us there. He then made some very friendly chit-chat. That was all well and good, but I was really there for the food.

I really enjoy a big breakfast, so my wife and I ordered enough food to get to $30 so we could use the $15 off $30. I had an omelette, bacon, eggs, coffee & OJ. While the portions were HUGE, and I almost ate it all, the food was a bit on the bland side. The maple syrup and salt saved the day, although the bacon was VERY tasty.  

Would I repeat? Probably not since we found \"The Original Sunrise Cafe\" and ate there the next 2 days for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Vegas, hands down. This is our second time and did not disappoint. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's in Las Vegas had the best chicken fried steak ever--so tender, but crispy outside!! Large servings, free refills on very good coffee. Everyone at the restaurant was very friendly and made it a great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Food took a while but they have a great atmosphere and our server was a peach! The food was good. They make their own verde sauce so definitely give that a try! Overall, a place I would return to."}
{"text":"what you can you say, you cannot give this place a bad review. right when you walk in you are greeted rigth away and updated on the status of your table. no problems there best service you can recieve when walking in. going in on a wednesday morning still busy but not overly crowded. good portions of food and sizes, tasteful nothing crazy, fast service and friendly, not a big place but not to cramped either. if you are ever in vegas this is a worthwhile place to come and eat away from the strip. I would come back again whenever i am in town."}
{"text":"Not a big yelp guy and don't yelp to often. I usually only yelp when something sucks bad or i am stoked about a place, I am stoked about this place. We were treated great, this place is great. The owner greeted me with a big smile, staff was awesome, food was great Chicken Fried Steak was epic!"}
{"text":"The staff are so friendly. They make you feel right at home. They suggested Mickey Mouse pancakes for my 2 year old and the host left her a little surprise for after breakfast. I am new to the area and now I know where my family will be coming. MR MAMAS! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast/lunch. Staff is always friendly here. Good variety on the menu. Chicken fried steak is one of our must haves here."}
{"text":"Great place for a good hearty breakfast.  Had the Eggs Benedict and was very happy along with the French Toast.  Man....the French Toast is really good.
Waiters/waitresses are really great and the owner is a real gem.  Talked to him about his heritage as a 2nd generation Greek/American and how he ended up with the restaurant.

Great people, great food, you could do a lot worse than this place.  Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"We loved it! 8 enthusiastic thumbs up! Yelpers didn't steer us wrong. We wanted something off the strip, as we were on our way out of town. Totally worth the drive and if you have to wait for a table, it's worth the wait. We were lucky enough to be seated right away. EVERYBODY was super happy and friendly (looks like the employees really like being there). We ordered Mama's short stack, biscuits and gravy, bacon and eggs and french toast. All were superb. The gravy has bacon and sausage and a little maple syrup -it's delish. We joked with our server, Lordes, that my husband spills and she said she didn't have a sippy cup, but gave him a napkin bib. When I went to take a picture of it, Sean (one of the Misters at Mr Mama's) grabbed my camera, stepped two tables away, grabbed somebody's empty chair and stood on it, then took a delightful photo of the four of us with our platters of food in front of us. . I asked if he would follow us around to be our professional photographer, but he said he had a restaurant to run - HA. Anyway, Mr. Mama's is fantastic. This goes on our list of favorite restaurants in Vegas for a good solid, hearty, fun breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. The sausage gravy and biscuits were very good. The owner, Nick, made our visit exceptional."}
{"text":"Tried Mr Mamas for the first time and was very impressed.  Service was fantastic, Denise our waitress was super nice and helpful.  Lots of people available to service everyone!!  My husband and I liked both enjoyed our dishes. I had biscuits and gravy, the little touch of maple syrup really made it!!!  Every pot of coffee is fresh ground and you really could taste the difference.  My husband's burrito was also delicious.  We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this place is one of the highest rated breakfast restaurants in Las Vegas. It's not frufru like some of the haute spots on the strip or outrageous like Hash House.  It's just really great breakfast for a decent price backed up with exceptional service. It's busy.  You may wait. It'll be worth it. Love the biscuits and gravy. Try the omelets and benedicts. This is old school diner breakfast done right. Good quality ingredients. Nice staff. It's hard to say anything negative."}
{"text":"Good service and friendly staff, quick and clean, but the food was not nearly as good as we anticipated."}
{"text":"exceptional customer service good food and reasonable prices i ordered the ribeye  steak and eggs which was delicious . Only complaint was the watery A1 sauce but it wont detour me away from this place being they are a hop skip and a jump away from me . Another thing is they are only open for breakfast and lunch so get there before 3 i believe is when they close ..."}
{"text":"Its breakfast. The potatoes are over cooked and crispy. That's what really made it ok for me instead of great. Also they were too salty."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for breakfast when I'm in the area.  There are lots of people waiting and helping to serve the food, so the service is always quick and friendly.  The food is nothing crazy, normal breakfast options, but I haven't had any complaints for sure.  It's not a place I would make a special trip out to, but if you are in the area for breakfast, I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great. A very friendly atmosphere, even the owner came out to say high. We are definitely coming back when we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was extra special due to their over the top friendly customer service. Apart from the food being good all the employees were so friendly and great customer service is what will get a business returning customers. Their biscuits and gravy was so delicious it's one of my favorites. I definitely recommend everyone to try this dish. As well as their Spanish omelette with avocado and toast on the side."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. SO GOOD! we got tons of food for a great price and it was all so delicious.
My husband got the mama stack, everything was amazing. We added blackberries to the pancakes which made it perfect. 5/5 for the pancakes
I got the eggs Benedict floretine with no olives and added bacon holy cow... I couldn't stop eating it! So delicious!! 5/5 for that as well
Then we shared a half order of biscuits and gravy, again, awesome. I'll give it a 4/5 though because it could have used a touch more gravy."}
{"text":"We drove up the parking lot around 8am and the place looked very quiet and the dimmed our windows made us question if it was open but as soon as we stepped out of the car and were two doors down, the host, a very nice and polite gentleman opened the door for us and greeted us with a friendly smile and sat us to our table. The staff was super friendly and immediately took our drink order, as our waitress brought us our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order, which we were. I had a sandwich with a side salad and my companion had an omelet with English muffins on the side. The waitress typed in our order in an iPad mini, I don't think five minutes had passed by when I see her coming with my salad and the English muffins, but she also had my toasted sandwich AND the omelet!! We were shocked at how quickly our food was brought, I had barely gotten back from washing my hands, lol. The SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING!!! I'm a Vegas local and happened to be in the area due to my family member being at the hospital near by, and with out a doubt, this restaurant's SERVICE IS THE BEST I'VE HAD IN VEGAS!!! My glass didn't even go half way down when it was refilled, we were constantly asked if we needed anything, if everything was satisfactory, if we were being treated correctly ...?!! Food was delicious, very fresh and just made. My sandwich was was still hot from being toasted, the veggies were very fresh and crisp, and even though everything was very quickly served, the food was neatly arranged on our plates. The omelet was very fresh, fluffy and delish from what my company mentioned. I will definitely come back to Mamas without a doubt."}
{"text":"????????????????!!

{"text":"A hidden gem, this place is probably one of the best restaurants to go for breakfast I've been to in a while! It has a really nice vibe to it and made me feel at home.Their new location is a great improvement from where they were before and I look forward to coming here more frequently."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for breakfast due to the high yelp ratings. 

After having breakfast here I have to say this place is just okay. I ordered the biscuits with gravy along with hash browns. Gravy was over seasoned with pepper and the hash brown tasted undercooked. For the prices they charge $9.75 for biscuits and gravy along with hash browns it was underwhelming. I've tasted better breakfast elsewhere with lower prices. The staff was friendly and so was the manager. The place was very clean and quaint. It does tend to get busy from 9-11am. 

Average tasting food. Would I recommend? Probably not."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place!!! Nothing fancy, just good food and good people. Everyone makes you feel welcomed, our first time there and they made me feel like family. They've got customer service nailed!!! When we arrived we were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes and the hostess apologized. Every 5 minutes, she thanked us for coming and apologized for the wait. This is why we stayed, we had a busy schedule and most places that tell you 20-25 minutes turns into 45 minutes. Not here, we were seated in 15 minutes.The waitress, Loures, was so friendly; she kept my coffee cup full. I never had to ask for more coffee, her attention to small details was amazing. The owner, Nick, greeted everyone and THANKED them for coming to his place. Nick stopped at every table to check and chat. We never felt rushed. They also offer free Wi-Fi; all the tables seat four people so there's plenty of room to spread out.

Now for the food, everything was cooked perfectly. I like sunny side up eggs, where the yolk is warm and runny, but the egg must me cooked and that's exactly what I received. The pancakes were hot and fluffy not rubbery. The sausage patties are huge, took one home. My husband ordered, per the recommendation of our waitress, the country fried steak; the gravy was thick and tasty. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. Simple home cooked good food and friendly service is why you come here. They have a wide array of omelets and  I've heard the French toast is fabulous and I'm looking forward to trying these items next time.

The reason for a four instead of a five - I like going to places that have a signature dish or specialty - something you can't get anywhere else. The food is cooked to perfection here, but there's nothing unusual on the menu. You can go anywhere in town and get eggs, pancakes, omelets, and hamburgers, but if you want chocolate chip pancakes or blueberry pancakes or crab omelets, go someplace else, there's nothing fancy here. But if you want a clean friendly place, food cooked perfectly, and reasonable prices you can't find any place better. Definitely going back for breakfast and I'll have to try lunch."}
{"text":"I love it here me and my husband and my daughter came in here and it was so good the staff was so nicely and the food amazing  we really enjoyed"}
{"text":"Straight up an old-school diner. The menu is extensive but not overwhelming. You will more than likely wait for a table but the service is quick. The receptionist at the door was very friendly and told me it would only be about 15 minutes and he said if you can't wait 15 minutes for their food then you should probably go somewhere else. He was joking of course. 

If you have small children it is probably best to order one breakfast for them and split it between them. I am giving you fare warning that the short stack of pancakes is enough to satisfy Paul Bunyan and his pal Babe the blue ox. Seriously, it was a lot of food for my kids and most of it went to waste. My wife ordered a cinnamon roll and that thing is about the size of a water balloon. It was a lot of roll, so I did what good husbands do and I ate most of it. She also went with a veggie omelet and said it was good. I had the country fried steak. They make a special gravy for it. It is plenty of food for you to share. I was feeling like a pig that day, so I truly was what I ate. 

It's a great place to stop for breakfast. Excellent service and great food. Simple and inexpensive. Get away from that resort you are staying at and make the drive just a few minutes west of the strip. I guarantee that it will be much better than that overpriced breakfast available downstairs at your hotel (that's unless you are staying at the best hotel ever with incredible breakfast). I'm sure the locals want to keep this place a secret. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"\"Hi Mom's, how's it going?\"
\"Pretty good Mike, and yourself?\"
\"Doing splendidilly-ended\"
\"Oh, that's so great to hear\"
\"I just visited your place the other day\"
\"Oh really, what did you think?
\"I really liked the food there. It was just as good as I remembered it at your old location, if not better!\"
\"Wow Mike, that's sounds really terrific! What did you get?\"
\"I first ordered a coffee for myself, because nothing goes better with breakfast than coffee\"
\"I totally agree with you, what did you think?\"
\"I liked the coffee, it was well brewed, and it did not have a bitter aftertaste\"
\"I'm happy to hear that, did you order any food while you were there?\"
\"As a matter of fact, I did\"
\"What did you order?\"
\"I wanted to start off with my favorite, eggs benedict\"
\"Oh, that's my favorite as well, did you like it?\"
\"I sure did. I liked that the eggs were definitely the stars of the dish. The hollandaise was well made, and the poached eggs were perfect. The canadian bacon wasn't too overpowering, and helped elevate the dish. The english muffin was fresh and crisp, just the way I likes it. Also, the hash browns on the side were crispy on the outside, and hot and creamy on the inside\"
\"I'm so glad to hear that, Mike\"
\"Are you really?\"
\"Yes I am. Were you able to try out anything else?\"
\"Yes, I wanted to see how your pancake and french toast stacked up\"
\"And how was that?\"
\"The pancake had a light and delicate texture, and wasn't too sweet. Honestly, one of the best pancakes I've ever had!\"
\"Mmmm, pancakes\"
\"I know, that's what I said!\"
\"How did you like the French toast?\"
\"Once again, it was great! It was thick, and wasn't soggy or dry, and the custard had a slight cinnamon taste that I enjoyed\"
\"How was the service, Mike?\"
\"What can I say? My server, Abby, was a complete rock star, friendly and helpful, can't ask for much more than that\"
\"Now I gotta ask you, Mike.. How come this wasn't a five star review? Everything seemed to be pointing in that direction\"
\"Well, there were a couple of minor issues. First, for some of the items, specifically the hash browns and the grits, I thought that they could have been seasoned a bit more aggressively. But, since there was a salt shaker at the table, that was easily remedied\"
\"And what else?\"
\"I ordered a burger medium rare and it came out mid-well. Plus, I didn't like the bun too much, it was a bit too squishy for my taste buds\"
\"Ah, I see\"
\"But I loved everything else, and this probably my favorite breakfast spot here in Vegas, and I will definitely come back!\"
\"Great! Can't wait to see you\"
\"Oh, and another thing\"
\"What's that, Mike?\"
\"Nah, I can't\"
\"It's ok, you can tell me\"
\"Nah, can't say it\"
\"Mike it's fine, just tell me, I want to know\"
\"I can't, because I forgot what I was going to say\"
\"....\"

{"text":"Great experience, kids took me to Mr. Mamas for Father's day. Waitress Jazmin was awesome, great service, great attitude and personality. Our drinks never got below half way before she was refilling our cups. To top our already great experience with the service and food, Jazmin wrote a note telling me Happy Fathers Day! You don't find to many people like Jazmin that will go above and beyond. I will be back and I will be back more often because of the spectacular service."}
{"text":"Wow the food was good! We got the biscuit & gravy, chicken fried steak & eggs & an omelette. Not the best chicken fried steak and it tasted slightly floury but pretty good. The gravy was good but definitely different with sausage, bacon and maple syrup in it. Biscuit was nice and fluffy. Omelette was great!"}
{"text":"So good make me wanna slap my momma. I ate breakfast there, got the French toast, eggs, and bacon. Not sure if I should come for lunch or dinner. The server we had was good even though it was busy she kept checking on us."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a wait but it was worth it. Enjoyed the food and great service. Would definitely go back again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"After my skydiving adventure, my sister and I were ready for a hearty breakfast. When we arrived, the place was bustling with people, which is always a good sign. The hosts at the front door were friendly and efficient. Once we were seated, the experience just got better. Lourdes was our server. She was friendly, helpful and attentive without being too overbearing. The food was reasonably priced, fresh and absolutely delicious. The owner was also friendly, making his rounds to greet and check on customers. Everyone in the place looked happy. Although our hotel was located on the strip, we did not want to spend a fortune on all our meals while visiting Las Vegas. This seems to be a place where a lot of tourists come to visit. I overheard the couple sitting next to us mention that they were from Chicago. Also, as we were leaving, there were two guys with suitcases standing outside, waiting to be seated. My visit to Mr. Mama's was by far, one of the THE BEST dining experiences I've ever had. If I am ever again in Las Vegas, I will be sure to pay this place another visit. GO! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast! Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. 
The food was spot on. The service was prompt and friendly. The new location is roomy and not far from the strip. 

Best part... Mr. Mama stopped by and said hi to the table. As everyone has said.... He's the nicest guy you'll ever meet. I wouldn't come back to Vegas and not come here. 

Definitely best breakfast in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast & wonderful staff & owners. My \"go to\" place for breakfast. I always get the chicken fried steak & eggs but all of the food is great. Love it."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!

I got the eggs benedict, and they were very well made. They also came with a side of hash browns, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Would recommend coming early, wait can get a little long. Overall, great food and great service and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love their new location.  And love that I can get great corned beef hash extra crispy.  Hash, hash browns and eggs all perfectly cooked to my liking.  Husband had the egg breakfast sandwich with Canadian bacon, which he said was great! And we shared a half order of biscuits & gravy which is always awesome.  Fabulous customer service and atmosphere.  A favorite when we are in town."}
{"text":"This place is the spot for after a long hard night! It's more mom and pops style. Which in my opinion is a good thing."}
{"text":"Great food,  generous portions,  good service. Went on Sat morning about 1100 not long to wait.  Really enjoyed breakfast burrito.  My daughter had bacon eggs.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 6 or 7 stars! Can't say enough good things. Service was astonishingly good. They opened the door for us, seated us with a smile, and were totally on top of everything. I dropped my knife at one point and one of their servers (without being asked) had a new one on my plate in a blink of an eye. My wife and I were amazed that they (1) noticed that I dropped it, (2) knew what utensil I had dropped, and (3) got a new one there so fast. Love these people!"}
{"text":"THE best breakfast anywhere in the US not just Vegas. You can't go wrong with any item on the menu. The friendliest owner and staff. We make it a point to have breakfast there each time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in my 40 years on earth (sorry grandma)! The staff, owner and food are top notch. I'm an out of towner who goes out of his way to eat here. This place is always a highlight of my vacation!"}
{"text":"Somehow, your meals taste 1000x better when you have amazing service. I mistook the guy calling out the reservation names as Mr. Mama himself, but I mean, who wouldn't be curious? He has the most up-beat, friendly, and warm personality. His smile and attitude towards everyone made me wonder what it was like to work here. Was it just him who's just so genuinely happy or was there some kind of amazing benefits package to be an employee here? 10 stars for customer service. 

Now, onto the food. The steak & eggs were both cooked just right, with the steak being tender and juicy to the core. The corned beef and eggs was delicious, as well. Although the corned beef was cooked a little differently from what I've had in the past. It was a little more fried up and I actually preferred this over the past corned beef I've had. Toast was buttered up so nicely, I kid you not, I think I had 4-5 whole slices. 

Keep up that upbeat and warm welcome, Mr. Mama! I don't know your name (I should have asked), but I bet you that many people return not just for the delicious food, but for the customer service too."}
{"text":"Was looking on yelp for a breakfast recommendation and found 1999 reviews and very highly rated so decided to try it out and write the 2000th review for this place!

Wow it's busy and packed but they get you in quick. We waited about 10 mins before we got seated. 

Everyone is very efficient, service is fast but our server was not friendly. 

Pancakes - I would give a 4 star. Kids chose to have chocolate chips (extra charge for that, wish the waitress mentioned that every add on was a charge). They were huge and looked delicious but were a little doughy. 

Eggs and potatoes - 5 star. Eggs were Perfectly cooked, soft and creamy. Probably the best hash browns I had. I love that we were asked exactly how we wanted our potatoes, and I wanted crispy and that's exactly how it was served. 
Orange juice was freshly squeezed. 

Overall Good breakfast place but I missed the WOW factor."}
{"text":"So the first time we got here they had just shut down for the day. It was a Saturday afternoon, after our daughters roller derby game. So \"Sean\" (the host at Mr. Mamas) suggested that we; checkout Rolling Smoke BBQ... WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! 

Later that night we go have dinner at Gordan Ramsey's Burger (Amazing). Bump into friends there (more derby fam) and they tell us Gordon is across the street at his new Hells Kitchen spot. So we haul butt over there just to miss him and current contestants.

While we were there we had it set in our minds we would come back for breakfast Sunday morning seeing as they already had 600 reservation for lunch and dinner that night.

But Sunday morning as I am getting dressed to head over there I remember Mr. Mamas. So glad I got to experience this place. Everything we ordered was perfect. The staff? Great. The layout? Great. Food? A+

There was nothing I had an issue with. Not even the prices. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I found this amazing place great for breakfast and lunch on Yelp, I read a lot of positive reviews and saw lots of delicious pics of the food so after me and hubby check out of the hotel we headed to Mr mamas. As we pulled up we saw there was a small crowd that was waiting to be seated, we put our name down & in about 20 minutes later we were seated. Our waitress took our drink orders immediately the staff was so nice felt like home. It was our first time there so we asked for suggestions,  I was in the mood for breakfast so I ordered a pancake combo my husband wanted lunch, he got the mama burger which was humongous both were delicious! Our waitress kept checking on us to make sure everything was good and we didn't need anything.  The staff was amazing. We always like to have a good meal before we take the 3 hour drive back to Cali. Will definitely be bk

One negative this that the layout of the tables are a little awkward, if you place it differently you can add about 6 to 8 more tables which would seat more customers"}
{"text":"I saw the food reviews, so when we wanted breakfast we came here. It was busy on Friday morning around 10 but were seated right away. Great attentive and friendly wait staff, and the food was delicious. We both had their steak and eggs, and they were cooked perfectly the way we wanted them. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places in Vegas. Very friendly staff and greats of every time!"}
{"text":"I just want to start this review off by saying how i was blown away by the Owner of Mr Mamas, he had plenty of wait staff but was cleaning tables, greeting customers, and seating diners. He interacted with everyone there asking how they were enjoying their meal. The pride he takes in his restaurant bleeds down to his employees as well. He stopped at our table and even shared a joke with my husband about Chicago and Michigan, and kept stopping by for chit chat which we enjoyed. When we were finished with our meal and he check to see how things were my husband asked him if they had corned beef hash on the menu, he lit up and said they did and how it's made from scratch and told him the care they take in preparation, we were pleasantly surprised that he said hold on let me get you a sample. His sample size was almost a portion and it was delicious. How may establishments gives you something for nothing? i don't know many that will, this is the type of customer service i look for in a place, his whole staff was friendly and attentive, makes you feel welcomed and appreciated for dinning there, and that is what he said when my husband thanked him for the corned beef was thank you for coming. OK on to the food, I chose the Steak and Egg and hash browns with onions an cheese. It was cooked to perfection, you just don't know how hard it is to get your steak cooked right the first time, while we were waiting on our food i noticed a waitress bringing someone their meal it was this huge burger and i have got to go back and try it, this is no processed burger(all their beef is angus) it looks like someone was in the kitchen with giant hands preparing the fresh formed patties. My husband chose biscuits and gravy and eggs over easy he was happy to finally find some good quality biscuits and gravy. We are definitely going to be regulars here, if i could give more stars i would that is what a wonderful experience we had and the food is just as great as the staff!"}
{"text":"Great, honest breakfast.  Stick to your ribs goodness. Friendly wait staff. A world removed from the Strip."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The Armando wrap is delicious and the cinnamon rolls are freshly made!"}
{"text":"The food and especially the coffee were great. Also the service was awesome, everyone was really friendly and welcoming. I'll be back."}
{"text":"On vacation in Las Vegas and my family stopped to eat breakfast here. I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine, pure deliciousness. We tried the pancakes too, fluffy perfection! I definitely recommend this for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm from California and was here visiting my parents who live here. We went to Bass Pro and where looking for a place to grab a bite. This place did not disappoint. I had the Mommas sandwich. Kind of like a club but better. It was fantastic. I got it with hash browns and they were good as well. My mom got the french dip and my dad got a caesar salad and they loved it. Service was fantastic to. I cant recall the waitress name but she was on spot. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back next time I visit."}
{"text":"Never had heard of this place. Went in during their lunch rush and was able to get right into a table with my wife and daughter. I had ordered biscuits and gravy and the waitress said let me get you a small serving of the gravy. OMG it was good. Wife loved her patty melt and my 4 year old daughter had a short stack and almost ate all of those pancakes. I'll have to go back to try more items. I'll give it"}
{"text":"Staff is so friendly, they have a special way of making you feel welcomed and the service cannot be beat. The food is solid everytime. My personal fav is the chicken salad sandwich and my husband loves the beef vegetable soup. I frequent here for the good food and friendly faces."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place in Vegas. Always busy and there is always a wait on peak time. Food is good but could be better. Portions are more than average which is always a plus. Customer service is good too. Overall a good place for breakfast.

3 out of 5 stars..!"}
{"text":"Love Finding New Local Eats! Found this Spot from a Local here in Las Vegas at The Excalibur that works in Valet Parking. If you haven't heard of or been to Mr. Mama's You Need To! Might be a little line but it's worth the wait! The Staff is so  Friendly and Awesome also the manager comes around and sees if your ok and he also likes to takes your picture when your food arrives to your table Now that's a Big Plus For Me!!! I'm a Big Foodie and I Loved that! I'm Not a local but I come out here enough to be I have Family out here So I'll Definitely Be Back Thanks Mr. Mama's for our 1st time and Not our last time experience here. Food was So Perfect and our waitress Denisse Z was Awesome and the intire staff You All Did Put a Smile on Our Face!  Aloha"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas! It's not close to my house, so I don't visit too often but I love it! Every single time I have been there, the owner walks around and asks how everything is. He seems like such a nice guy! This adds a nice touch to the already great place! I like the new location, it is way bigger! Since this place is always busy, that's important because no one likes to wait, especially for breakfast.

So far I have tried the french toast, eggs and bacon. Delicious! The french toast is absolutely perfect. I took my nephew when he was in town visiting and he had the pancakes. They were so big! He said they were yummy and he wants to go back during his next visit.

This is a great place for locals and tourists. It's really close to the strip and affordable, so if you have a rental car, you should go! Even if you have to take a taxi, I would still recommend going. You will probably still pay less with the taxi fair than if you had breakfast in your hotel."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!

We were there on our way back to Fresno! Very friendly and family oriented place. Food great, home made fresh and affordable! 

Would def visit them again! 
Ordered customized omelet and much more tasty food! 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The owner was not able to accommodate our large party. He was very unprofessional. Alex, the server was excellent though! He made our experience worth it"}
{"text":"So many wonderful things to say about this restaurant! The food was delicious, the staff was amazing, the restaurant was clean and not-overcrowded, and the owner is amazing! While eating our breakfast, the owner was walking around checking-in on tables. You can tell he cares deeply for his patrons and the experience they have in his restaurant. Next time we're in Vegas we will be paying Mr. Mamas a visit!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the customer service is on point! Try the Cinnamon roll as an appetizer. It's fresh and soft and sweet. Perfect! No kids menus, but the portions are large enough to share with a little one. (Our toddler just ate from our food and had plenty left over!)"}
{"text":"Mr mamas is welcoming along with all his staff. Excellent service and excellent food with good portions and very tasty food. This will fast become our regular spot for breakfast. Who needs a buffet when you have an amazing place like this for food. Even their lunch salads and burgers looked great. Definitively coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. They really know how to cook the food the right way. Friendly staff, busy place at times but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was my foodie adventure for Saturday morning with the boyfriend, and it did not disappoint. 
There were about 4 people ahead of us. Going in was cool 'cause there was an observant host. The guy was pretty badass looking - tattoos, ear piercings with a raspy tone of voice. LOL. But totally nice. He noticed I had gotten to the door before a couple, and was like \"Hey guys, I'm going to put her down first since she rolled up before you. Is that okay?\" Totally considerate, but I didn't wanna impede on another couple's date day, so I let him take their name down first instead. Same guy chatted it up with everyone that was waiting, wished everyone a good day when they left, and still managed to keep track of tables to fill, etc. 
Once seated, the good vibes and customer service didn't stop with him. We had Jasmine as our waitress, and she was extremely sweet and polite. She constantly checked up on us, even after we paid as we finished up the meals. Liked how she kept my coffee topped off 'cause I definitely needed it that morning/afternoon. Food was definitely tasty, came out warm from the kitchen, and was a decent portion for breakfast/brunch. 
Random, surprising moment of the meal was when my boyfriend got his burger, flipped the top bun off to spread ketchup, and the same host was like \"Hey buddy, lemme get you different lettuce... If my lettuce looked like that, I wouldn't want it.\" The lettuce was seriously no big deal to the boyfriend (were pieces closest to lettuce head's core), but he definitely appreciated the consideration and attention to detail the guy gave/had. 
Overall, I liked the meal. Very fulfilling and homey, and the customer service made it all a better experience."}
{"text":"We were super happy that we took a quick trip off the beaten path in Vegas to this awesome breakfast spot! Old-school, homestyle diner in a strip mall with good portions, high quality and reasonable prices (hard to find in Vegas!). The homemade cinnamon rolls were amazing, and our breakfast platters were filling and tasty. Service was excellent - always a win when everyone is nice to the three year old - and the owner even stopped by our table to check in on us. I'd highly recommend this spot if you need a filling breakfast after a night of partying in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a breakfast spot that we really like and Mr Mama's is it!  Superb food, friendly staff and wallet pleasing prices!  Omelet was fantastic as was the biscuit and gravy order!  This will be our spot for breakfast now!  No need to look further!"}
{"text":"Bustling diner style atmosphere at around 9:30-10am on a Sunday morning. Wait was about 15-20 minutes, and the people filing in after us (which were many) had a 25+ minute wait. Clean restaurant, efficient service (not overly interactive, but always kept our coffee full and took our order quickly). After seeing all the rave reviews on Yelp! we assumed it would be worth the 20 min drive from our hotel. Food was executed effectively and you get what you expect, decent size portions. We had a veggie omelette, the corned beef hash, and a cinnamon roll. My omelette was loaded with veggies, and husband's hash looked pretty good. The cinnamon roll, meh, not much icing and rather dry, although it looked nice on the plate. Was it worth the drive? Well the prices are exceptionally affordable for Vegas, so that's great. The food is worth what you pay for it, no complaints there. There is plenty of (free) parking. It's a good place. I don't know that we'd make the drive again since it was out of the way, but if you are nearer, go for it."}
{"text":"Generously portioned, tasty home-made breakfast, great service, that pretty much sums up Mr Mamas. The feta omelette was very delicious with lots of egg. The hashbrown was crisp. The location is great too not too far away from the Strip and there are plenty of parking outside of the restaurant. The only thing that was unsatisfying was the coffee which tasted a little bland."}
{"text":"Not sure if people in vegas maybe have different taste or expectations but I really did not find this place to even be close to a 4.5 stars place.

Waited about 30 minutes to sit for a party of 2, server wasn't rude or friendly.. more towards the rude side. Under the menu sections I ordered the burrito which is under a section that says it includes toast so I asked for the toast and she rudely tells me it doesn't come with toast... confused I asked her why it was under a section that clearly shows that it comes with toast, she never explained to me just kept saying NO TOAST NO TOAST and yes she was definitely 100% fluent in english so I'm not sure why she just kept repeating that and ignoring my question.

my burrito was decent, nothing better than a typical breakfast burrito at del taco or your local mom and pop shop though, definitely not worth the drive from the strip or the wait"}
{"text":"Got here around 730am on a Saturday for breakfast. From the outside it looked like it might have been closed but there was definitely people inside. We were greeted and seated immediately. Decent sized menu. Majority of the staff stopped by to say hi and ask how things were or suggest an item which was very impressive customer service. The coffee was delicious and free refills! I ordered a veggie omelet with egg whites and it was perfect. The home fries were crispy and well seasoned. My meal also came with toast but I was too full. Will definitely return !"}
{"text":"How can these country fried potatoes be this good

My friend from Dallas and I, went to this restaurant for brunch. It was packed! But the wait went by fast. They have plenty of seating in this restaurant. It's a very open concept with the tables and chairs. The staff was very friendly; they were always smiling!

We got seated and waters were brought out immediately. Our waittresss gave us time to look at the menu. She went through and gave her recommendations as well.  I ordered the eggs benedict with canadian bacon and my friend ordered 2 pancakes, 2 Eggs with country fried potatoes. 

Our orders came out quickly. We were ready to eat so very happy about the service at Mr. Mamas. I requested extra crispy hashbrowns and they got it perfectly. The eggs benedicts were classically made; the hollandaise sauce was perfect. The portions were huge as well. 

My friend enjoyed his meal and I had to help him finish because of how big the portions were. The pancakes were fluffy and buttery YUM! 

And of course, the country fried potatoes, my goodness that was a pandemonium of flavors; my taste buds were having a party! Our waitress was so friendly and made sure she didn't just grab plates!! She asked before grabbing anything. 

I gave this place a five because they stayed true to what they offered. This place is meant to be classic breakfast food and they do it well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was perfect and had the service to match. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The food portions were amazing for the price. This place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We're visiting for EDC and this place is all PLUR   Mr. Mamas is a charmer who makes your experience great!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I'm so glad we did because I didn't want to eat at a buffet. Makes me so full fast. Hubby had found this place on Yelp and most of the reviews were high rating. 

It's located in a small shopping center. We got a parking stall right up front. As we approached the door, a friendly guy opened the door for us. He worked there and greeted us hello. 

We got seated at a table. The kind waitress took our drink orders. I got an iced tea. I was debating on either getting breakfast or lunch. I wanted a burger, so I got the Mama's burger which is 1 pound of meat. It consisted of mushrooms, avocado, lettuce, tomato, bacon, red onions and I went with cheddar cheese. You get a choice of a type of cheese. I got French fries with my burger. It also came with a slice of dill pickle. I had to eat my burger with a knife and fork because it was too big to take a bite. Burger was juicy. Cheddar cheese was melted. Mushrooms were perfect. The bun was even buttered and toasted to perfection. One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas! The fries were cooked well. I truly enjoyed my burger. I had to give almost half of it to hubby. 

Service was great! Waitress asked if I needed a refill on my iced tea. I was fine. I thought the waitress was a little forgetful because she gave my burger to my hubby. I had to tell her the burger was mine. She also thought my hubby had an iced tea when he ordered a Pepsi. I understand if she got busy tending to other customers. A waitress who waits on you should remember what you ordered. That's considered excellent skills! I had to dock a star for that. 

Overall experience was good! Highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak's exterior had a nice crunch and had a medium texture throughout. The fried steak holds up without the gravy but...you owe it to yourself to taste  the gravy! The southern gravy has the goldilocks stick to your ribs thickness, a hint of sweetness and generous chunks of sausage.  Hash browns cooked with butter (I presume), 3 eggs and a flakey biscuit really rounded out the meal.

The servers were attentive and the food was delivered quickly.  Crowds generate here so be prepared to wait. Ask yourself what good place have you eaten at without a wait?"}
{"text":"oh my gawd. the chocolate pancake i had was like chocolate therapy. though it was really filling i could not stop eating it. it was delicious. alll sorts of chocolate on it. there were chocolate chips and chocolate sauce. it also came with whipped cream. there were 2 buttermilk pancakes that were nice thick and fluffy. just the way pancakes should be. i highly reccomend this place as a brunch place. or breakfeast. but i gotta warn ya. you will  not be hungry for a while after you eat here. the food is very good. well done guys. will be back fosure."}
{"text":"The best thing about Mr Mamas is definitely their customer service. They have intentionally set out to make this place feel like you're walking into your family's house. You're welcomed immediately with a smile and our server Jasmine took care of us the entire time. 

The food- was your average breakfast comfort food. What sets them apart from their competitors is how they make you feel when you walk, how they treat you while you're dining and the impression you have when you walk away! Definitely worth coming too"}
{"text":"THE WAIT IS WORTH IT!!

Came in the day after Christmas with a party of 6. We had a wait of about 35 minutes but they were good about answering our questions of when we were next. We were packed in the small waiting area, but they have chairs and a small nice seating space - which can get cramped.

The food is delicious! Best pancakes I've had in a long time! I loved that they had smaller orders of the same great meals - the kids (10 and 13) got to get the same adult favorites but in their sizes without being called kids. :) 

My chicken fried steak was very yummy and I'd even order it again - super large portions! Family all loved their dishes and the hot chocolate and coffee were perfect. Pancakes are definitely sharable but you could finish them off yourself if you wanted to. 

And I love it how they do not pack more tables and chairs in the dining hall just to alleviate the waiting customers. Makes the dining experience more comfortable and roomy. I'm not cramped while eating or playing elbow hockey.

Cathy our server was phenomenal! She has our coffees filled and our order exactly right with the biggest smile and nicest personality. The youngest was even smitten with her and couldn't take his eyes off her. LOL! She was great!

You are definitely eating with family here! Mr. Mama comes around and gives you a smile, shakes a hand and makes sure he took care of you while you were in his house. Loved it! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal!  Great food and customer service. Location is further away from strip but well worth the drive. It's a must visit when I come to Vegas. I haven't tried their lunch, but the breakfast is huge, delicious and well priced. Keep up the great work Mr Mamas!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. It's yummy food, not way fancy but good portions. Only serves breakfast and lunch and closes around 2-3 pm. Promises to be one of my fave when visiting  Vegas."}
{"text":"We saw the 5 star reviews and knew we had to try it! Upon pulling up Mr. Mama himself greeted us and opened the door! He was super cheery and and introduced the hostess who showed us to our seat. Kathy S. was our waitress and she was perfect! Smiley and efficient. Our order was perfect even with our requests for customized omelets. Food was super delicious! The location isn't too far from the strip and I would drive here again and again just to support this business! Mr. Mama thanked us and said he appreciated us as we left! Such a great local business."}
{"text":"The moment we walked in we were greeted by the owner, who was very friendly and kept us updated on our wait time. He went around the tables and engaged customers, ensuring that the food and service was up to par. I loved the team work customer service here, the staff was pleasant and cooperated well together here and it shows! The food was really good and very reasonably priced. My sister said that the food here was better than the breakfast restaurant we went to yesterday, and I had to agree!"}
{"text":"Great service. The host is awesome and gets awesome pictures using a chair. The food is amazing. The short stake w two eggs and bacon is a plate full. The eggs Benedict are very good as well."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place but the line is always out the door. When you walk in you're immediately greeted. The hosts and servers are awesome and welcoming. They check on you frequently during your visit and the manager (or owner?) Rounds and asks if everything is okay. I honestly thought the food was just OK. I got chicken fried steak and it wasnt bad at all. I guess I was just expecting to be blown away (after seeing the reviews and lines out the door). I also got a cinnamon roll and I hated it. I didn't think it was fresh or delicious. Maybe I just got the wrong thing but I really didn't enjoy the food. I have to give this place four stars because they have five star service. They really do have great customer service, which in my book goes a long way."}
{"text":"Wow, super friendly and courteous service.  Clean facility and restrooms.  The food was tasty and priced well.  A must stop if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as the rebiews.  Very good food and the best service we encountered in Vegas."}
{"text":"There's almost no time waste on waiting even there are a lot of customers already inside.  Staff are friendly and courteous.  Waitress knowledgeable on the menu and specials.  Their omelet is superb.  Love the place."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing customer service! Been here a few times now and am never disappointed. It's one of my favorite breakfast places in Las Vegas. The breakfast burrito is my fave."}
{"text":"First time here in Vegas and tried Mr. Mamas for breakfast. We were kindly greeted immediately walking in the door by Nick, a.k.a \"Mr. Mama\". Our server was great, very attentive and kind. Food was great too. I got the Mama's french toast. Nice and filling! The scrambled eggs and the western omelet we ordered both had an orange garnish which gave the eggs a light and subtle orange flavor which was very nice. French toast was hearty with just a perfect amount of cinnamon and powdered sugar. We are happily stuffed! The restaurant itself was nice and open, light decor and open kitchen window. Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mammas was great place for Breakfast. Very friendly and fun atmosphere the buttermilk pancakes were super fluffy and just as yummy. The Country gravy is KILLER! Come and try it for yourself. The crew is focused on service and making sure you have a great breakfast. We will be back and you should you."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I can't believe we found breakfast this good with incredible friendly service at super reasonable price in Las Vegas!!!! Had the Philly Cheese Omelette, was going to take a picture but just realized I cleared my plate - THAT GOOD :) Will come here again next time in Vegas. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs and corn beef hash.  The eggs with home fries, the hash with hashbrowns because duh.

This restaurant's food was really good.  I'd never say it's the best X, Y, or Z of anything I had eaten, but it's somewhere where I would return repeatedly because the food is just solid.

Their potatoes, whether they be home fries or hashbrowns, are on point.  Damn good taters.

Awesome service and they have the restaurant running like a machine.  Also really awesome coffee to me, but I may just be used to garbage work coffee."}
{"text":"Food is always good and Mr.mama and Sean are always wonderful and pleasant. The cafe is plain looking but I suppose you aren't there to look at pretty wallpaper you are there to eat. Place gets busy on weekends but that's a good thing."}
{"text":"shhhh....the is the best breakfast spot in Las Vegas hands down. We ate here back to back breakfasts as we had a car to get to the spot. The food was consistently spot on from both days. Had the two eggs with bacon and toast. Eggs tasted real fresh, I know real fresh as we have a chicken that provides us fresh eggs. The hashbrowns were nice and crispy on the outside and cooked properly in the middle. Service was even 5 star + as they greeted you upon arrival and our server was the same server both mornings, PROPS to her too!"}
{"text":"Good food - just very crowded.  We felt a little rushed.  But, probably the best place you are going to find in Las Vegas for brunch."}
{"text":"We went around 12pm on a Saturday and it was pretty packed. I read Yelp reviews before going so I expected waiting in line. The wait was about half an hour. I had the eggs Benedict with veggies. Food was good but not as great as I thought. My all time favorite breakfast/brunch spot still remains at Yolk in Chicago. 

Food was in humongous portion. Well worth the price. Will go back and try their other eggs Benedict choices."}
{"text":"I give it a 4* because the staff is amazing. I couldn't believe how many people they had working. The food is just basic. Nothing special. Prices aren't bad. If it weren't for the people working and being so attentive I'd probably give it a 3*"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Vegas. The nice gentleman even opened the door for us upon arrival. Very friendly atmosphere. The pancakes were the size of my plate! Our bill was reasonable for 2 people. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Mr. Mamas even before moving to Las Vegas permanently 5 years ago. It is still the BEST BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS!!! If you haven't tried it, you don't know what you are missing.  Their coffee is to die for!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been at Mr Mammas many times, we always were greeted by the owner when we went he was always so nice. Today 10/13/15 our stay was not good. First, it started with the waitress Claudia. We had to wait for a long time for our coffees and waters. We also waited a long time to place our food order. When we finally received our food , I found a small bone in my ham. My wife did not receive her toast she ordered, also  I did not receive the red peppers and onions on my home fries, I told the waitress she brings them in a small dish. She told me the cook didn't put them on. We asked for the owner to come over, so we could mention what went wrong. All he did was apologized two times. He didn't say anything else, like what can I do for you folks? For your bad service. When we said more about the bad service, the owner took our check and walked away with a attitude and said l'll take care of your check. It did seem to us that the owner didn't like to hear complaints. It showed us he is a very phony owner. In the past, he was a very friendly owner. Today, he showed us he has a attitude and doesn't care about his customers. We have been coming here a long time and now we know what the owner is all about. The owner , also should spend less time talking to customers and start caring about customers concerns. Or maybe walk around with coffee. Our experience was so bad, we will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Great place! While I got my car taken care of in the shop, I decided to go take a walk for breakfast. I got to this place easily and was greeted with a welcoming smile and got sat immediately. My server was very nice and knowledgeable. I got coffee and decided to order the veggie wrap with hash browns. The wrap comes with eggs in it and to my pleasant surprise, the hash browns were actually inside the wrap, which was fantastic. I got some salsa with my wrap and I ordered Pico de Gallo as well. That was actually not to my liking so I'm glad I asked for it on the side. My server, Claudia, kept filling my coffee exactly when I needed and always with a smile. When I was about to leave (around 9am) there was already a wait list. They were so nice that even when I left they asked me how it was and they hoped to see me again. They will surely see me again!"}
{"text":"Usually when we visit Vegas we go to another very popular diner close by. This time my son wanted to try this place which is real close to where we were staying.  We waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. I ordered the steak and eggs which is a thin slice of ribeye steak. It was very tender cooked exactly as I asked.  My son had the ham and eggs and he said the ham was perfect.  To top off the meal, the pancakes are a must. Huge portion and absolutely yummy!  The service was quick and friendly. We were helped by Denisse who was super nice and very attentive. This place is a must!! Great food super affordable."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning expecting a long wait time. We were told wait time would be about 30 minutes and we only waited about 15! Very casual breakfast vibe.
Basic breakfast and lunch menu options but homemade flavors.
Excellent customer service! Everything came out right, and fast! Will come back and try the pancakes with hopes of bumping my review to 5 stars. 

*May experience longer wait times with parties larger than 4"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely amazing. Truly nice individuals that work here, everyone was so friendly and helpful they really go out of your way to assist you and make you happy. I wish I got our servers name because she was so nice!!!
The food was also great, we got the California Omelette and it was delicious. Big servings for a great price! 
Will definitely be returning next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast. Service is excellent and food is great. I would invite others to eat here."}
{"text":"The best breakfast. There was a 30 min wait and it was sooo worth it. You must try the eggs Benedict, the hollandaise is to die for! The bacon had great flavor. The cinnamon roll was decadent. Oh, and the service was amazing. It was quick, very friendly and they kept our coffee cups full! Definitely recommend, and if there's a wait, I promise it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome french toast! Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever.  Awesome chili with onion and  cheese.   Had to wait 25 min at 1030 on a Friday but worth it.  2nd time here and as good as the first."}
{"text":"We are a Colorado family who comes to Vegas often. Every time we visit we always come to Mr. Mamas for breakfast. It is nice to see the same familiar faces even though we aren't locals. It says a lot that we recognize the employees there when we come. They obviously treat their staff well! Their customer service is superb! The food is delicious and plenty of items to choose from. I highly recommend visits Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"We showed up around 9:20am on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 15 minutes. Very quick service and very friendly. Cinnamon roll was super good. Large portions my hubby and I shared an omelette and French toast. A little pricey for breakfast but you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing waitstaff.  Delicious food.  I had a eggs florentine Benedict added bacon. Was done to perfection."}
{"text":"Unpopular opinion alert! I still don't understand the hype. Was disappointed by my experience at their previous location, but heard I \"just didn't order the right thing\". Took a group here and ordered several breakfast dishes at their new location. Maybe I overhyped it by mentioning that it was on Yelp's Top 100 list for 2014, but no one at the table was impressed by the food- though the service was consistently good.

The CHICKEN FRIED STEAK & EGGS was the best dish of our group- nicely breaded, good gravy, but could have used some salt. The Greek Omelet and Veggie omelets were both just okay, both were eaten with a hefty addition of hot sauce because they were bland. The hashbrowns and homefries were both nicely crispy, but had no seasoning of any sort. Pancakes did not get finished, very generic. Biscuits were done nicely, gravy was good... after adding a hefty shake of salt. 

I would like to note that I do not normally add salt to my food at restaurants, I don't like salt, but the food here was not seasoned properly, or rather- at all."}
{"text":"Loved the original location and love the new location more! We don't get here often but they remember us every time and what we usually order. The staff is uber friendly and the food is well prepared without trying to be pretentious.  Our favorite breakfast spot in Vegas"}
{"text":"First time there and I ended up coming back two days later. Their buttermilk pancakes were spot on for my cravings. Everything is worth trying. Mr. Mamas is my new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Great place! Even better food! Mr. Mamas reflects the perfect balance of service and quality. I highly recommend this establishment for breakfast/lunch. Food was fresh and very tasty. Portions are big. Alex was our server."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We didn't realize that we went in right before closing but everyone was still super nice and I didn't notice they closed until I saw the closing time on yelp. Most people will \"make sure\" you know it's closing time. Those a-holes. But this place was super friendly and nice even though they almost closed.

The service was friendly and super fast. They even gave us a complimentary cinnamon roll to apologize for the long wait. (I didn't even think it was long. Seriously it wasn't) but can't refuse a few cinnamon roll.

Got the eggs benedicts florintine with their house fries and the Mamas burrito. Both were delicious.

Then the end came and the price was even better!

Come check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"After a crazy weekend in Vegas, make a pitstop on your way back at this local family breakfast/brunch place. The stellar service and food made a nice finale for a great weekend. 

The spinach, avocado, and mozzerella and pamersan cheese in the Spanish omelet blended well togetheher. The French toast was the right balance of sweetness and cinnamon."}
{"text":"no disclosure for extra charge for onions on home fries.  Nickel and dime.
Place needs to change policy of gouging customers.  Onions are always
included at other establishments.  Total turn off, even though food/service
was good."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Mr. Mama's. The first time I went was at the old location. I remember trying the country fried steak & eggs. It did not hit the spot for me, so I decided to try to this place again. This time, at their new location. It's even closer to my house now. The service is good. They always checked up on our table & always made sure our waters were filled. I ordered the Western omelet with hash browns this time. The hash browns were my favorite part because they were so crispy & delicious. However, the omelette was okay. Nothing spectacular or something that I would crave. The prices are pretty decent as well. Many people write 5 star reviews for this place, so I guess I just have to see which foods are most popular. I wouldn't mind giving it one more shot to find that one item that truly satisfies me. :)"}
{"text":"This is such a great breakfast spot for any occasion. You won't leave hungry guaranteed, they take care of you and aren't scared to give you that extra amount of food. Truly feels like family with great service and a home-like atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was the best chicken fried steak I've ever had!  The service was excellent. It was a very busy day when we arrived but they got us seated within ten minutes.  The owner was present and very welcoming and funny!  I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of outstanding.  
The food is really good.   The service is excellent and the people who work there amazing.  

4 of us are breakfast and I wouldn't come back to Vegas without taking a car service here for breakfast.   A little too far to walk but worthy of the trip."}
{"text":"I finally tried Mr. Mamas.  It's the #2 restaurant in Vegas on TripAdvisor (as of the writing of this review).  The most outstanding thing is the number of hardworking people in this restaurant, a large number of workers who are all busy.  Second, everyone is incredibly friendly, and you probably won't get in or out of the restaurant without a very cheery welcome and thank you.  The service is spectacular.

The food: pretty standard breakfast fare -- no exotic options here.  I went with chicken fried steak.  The steak seemed a little pre-fab (my only complaint) but was very well seasoned (thank you!). And the gravy was excellent.  Homemade and tasty (I had been to another restaurant in the previous week that had average gravy and was disappointed)."}
{"text":"Super good breakfast food and fast service for a fair price. Will come back on next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Mr Mamas delivers excellent service with a knockout punch.

What really makes a difference here is their amazing customer service.  From walking in, the gentleman seating us already makes you feel as if you're one of the family.  The continued greatness is felt throughout the meal and you're walking out the door.  

The meal here was good.  I had ordered the Mama's Sandwich which is loaded with turkey, bacon, avocado and pepper jack cheese.   The bread is wonderfully toasted to hold in all of the goodness. The French fries were ok but somewhat under done.  It was unfortunate.  I know I will definitely be back to try their breakfast items.  

This new location is much bigger than their previous spot.  Different location but same great service.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"First time here..was immediately greeted by the owner who was so welcoming and nice!! Food was great, will be back next time we in Vegas"}
{"text":"Worth the trip for sure! Everything was good and the pancakes were amazing! Definitely should check it out."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!  Shawn received as the door and he is super friendly.  Kathy had a smile that lit the place up.  Don't get scared of the line they move very fast.  We had the Denver omelet and it was fresh!"}
{"text":"A surprise hidden in a small strip mall. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. The server was quick to get to the table and take drink orders. As we waited Mr. Mama himself came to the table to talk to us. He's a really nice guy from Detroit, loves sports! He told us about his favorite things on the menu. The chicken fried steak with the sausage gravy is one of his favorites. I can see why. That dish did not disappoint at all. Someone at our table got pancakes and they were the size of the plate, they were light and fluffy and just amazing. I come to Vegas every so often and I found a new breakfast spot. If you have the time and you want to get off the strip and have a great meal at a decent price mr. mama is the place to go."}
{"text":"We made a stop here after arriving in Vegas early morning. We were accommodated regularly since we had a bigger party of 14 people, it's not far from the airport and it's located in a plaza so it also has good parking. 

Food: 4/5 I got the chicken fried steak and it was soooooooo good! They have homemade gravy and it was one of the best ones I've had yet, I got a side of eggs and they were well done as well as their potatoes. If you get their potatoes stick to their cube potatoes, they had a crunch yet they were soft in the inside. Only reason I'm giving this a four is because my boyfriend got the steak with eggs & the steak was not good. It came out looking thin & was chewy. If you come here stay to the more popular options (chicken fried steak, eggs Benedict) I also have to compliment them on their pancake, it is huge! And their toast was the perfect amount of buttery. They do serve huge portions so I would also recommend sharing if you both don't have a big appetite. 

Staff/Customer Service: They are definitely open, honest & genuine. Since we had a big party they let us know if it was okay to serve the two couples that got there before us. They wanted us to feel appreciated and I have to applaud to that. Many restaurants lack communication and at mr.mamas they treat you like family."}
{"text":"4.5*

Mr. Mamas is your classic American-style breakfast restaurant. The breakfast options here are classic and tastes just like home. There's nothing gourmet or special about Mr. Mamas, but the exceptional service, cheap prices and delicious breakfast makes this place worth a visit.

[Service: 5]

Mr. Mamas was my first stop in Vegas and boy, was it a great way to start my trip. I was greeted with a super friendly staff. Everyone was attentive and wanted to make sure we were having a pleasant dining experience. Our server, at the end, went out of her way to offer my bf and I water cups to-go, which was thoughtful and nice. The manager (or owner) was humble and SUPER friendly. He made us feel welcomed. I also noticed other workers consistently wiping down the tables and condiments at each table. 

[Food: 4]

Come here for some good ole buttermilk pancakes, biscuits and gravy and egg benedicts. Everything we had was simple, homey and delicious!

[Value: 5]

Highly recommend. Great bang for your buck. I got the $15 for $30 deal off of Yelp and had a little bit of trouble using up the $30 for my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great home cooked food and the customer service is outstanding. The owner is the sweetest gentlemen who welcomes and thanks every customer. Had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"The hubs and I went today for breakfast.  AMAZING . We are foodies and truly get excited to eat good food! Ha!

The French toast was so good, the eggs made exactly how I like and the bacon.  Omg.  Very good quality food.

The hubs chicken fried steak was great but the gravy they put on top of it stole the show. It was literally the best gravy I've ever tasted. The biscuits bomb. Hash browns bomb.

We are very pleased. Thank you mr. Mama's for quality food and great service.  Now ready for a nice nap by the pool!"}
{"text":"Jasmine is great. The coffee is tasty. The portions are big! Breakfast is my favorite meal and this place knows what they're doing! They even ask you how you like your bacon cooked. Love this little place. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"This has to be my #1 place to go for Breakfast or lunch! They have one of the friendliest staff in the food world. 
Their food is amazing! I've never had a complain about their service. Try for yourself"}
{"text":"What a great find! We just moved here and have been looking for a good breakfast place. We are ecstatic over Mr Mamas! We were greeted immediately before the door shut and seated in their spacious, clean, well lit dining hall. Our order was made quickly and looked and tasted fresh and delicious. Our coffee was filled before we even thought about asking, and the waitress, Claudia, was attentive and sweet. As we left, there were two waitresses, including ours, who said good bye and the gentleman at the door, most likely the GM, gave us a nice good bye and a wonderful smile. It was almost like they opened their doors just for us. It was noticeably more crowded as we left at 9:00, than when we came at 8:30. So go early! We have found our Saturday morning breakfast place! Thank you Mr Mamas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, prices, and service! The only thing we'd change would be more AC as it was quite hot. As we were leaving, the host suggested that we not sit in the corner by the windows next time (so ask for a table under a fan)."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, great selection, friendly staff. French toast and Greek yogurt parfait were among the good stuff I tried today. This place is outside of the main strip, but worth the small trip via Uber or Lyft to save $ and get good cheaper food !"}
{"text":"I am buying into the hype! My husband and I like to start our generally hectic days by having breakfast together. Tired of our usual joints, we decided to see what all the hype is about at Mr. Mamas. We were pleased to see plenty of parking and a spacious restaurant. Most of the tables were filled, but we were able to snag a seat without any wait. The menu is to the point with some very intriguing and traditional selections. The menu does appear to be Greek inspired which I thought was a fun twist on a breakfast joint.

The coffee was consistently refilled and the service was spot on. The owner was out and about mingling and chatting with the patrons. 

I opted for the Jenna Wrap while my husband went with a more traditional chicken fried steak and hash browns. We also had a side of gyro meat. My wrap consisted of over hard egg, avocado, cilantro, jalapeno, salsa, sour cream,
& cheddar cheese. It was a perfect, light blend of ingredients to get my morning started.  The chicken fried steak was perfectly prepared and the gravy wasn't too overwhelming. It was the perfect balance of unhealthy but delicious goodness. The gyro meat was also a hit.
 
Price point is pretty standard for s breakfast joint but with superior good and service."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service with good food made for a great experience. We were greeted by the friendliest owner I have ever came across upon entering. There was a short wait for our table which was impressive considering how busy it was. Once seated we were greeted by Denisse who assisted us with taking our order in a friendly manner. Service was fast and on point in every aspect. We will defiantly be back and will highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to get some fluffy pancakes and eat at a comfy spot. Went here during the weekend so it was expected to be busy, still the workers were really nice and the vibes were really inviting. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for breakfast! I had those wonderful pancakes and the sausage there is super good! 

Cozy atmosphere and our server was nice. She wasn't as nice as the last server but she was okay."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. Food was delicious. We love it! It was our first time eating there. We had to way around 10 minutes. I will recommend this restaurant 100%. Homemade type of food."}
{"text":"Very good. The wait is well worth the food! The staff was amazing and accommodated our large party with ease. They were very attentive to my food allergies which is something that makes me so thankful. I had eggs, bacon and potatoes but around the table there was eggs Benedict, a breakfast burrito, pancakes, biscuits and gravy and more. Listen to the reviews, go to Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"Great spot,friendly customer service and the amount of food for the price is amazing. I couldn't even finish my pancakes you need two people in order to finish them all. Will come back again. Thank you for the hospitality"}
{"text":"I went here because I found it on yelp. I brought my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter. We went around 9ish on a Saturday. The employees were extremely welcoming. They open the door as soon as you get to it. Someone is calling to the back so they know how many people are coming in and let me say; there were a lot of people coming in! The place was packed! We were seated right away. Waitress was awesome. Food was delicious!! Pancakes are amazing! The sausage patties were delicious! This place is great! I will be going back. BTW, I drove 30 minutes to get there, and I'm super lazy, so for me to say I'll go back is saying A LOT!!"}
{"text":"Was search for a restaurant to have brunch and was drawn to Mr. Mamas. Found out after meeting the owner that he was a native Detroiter!! My omelette was delicious, I actually ate everything on my plate, which is actually unusual for me. I will definitely visit Mr Mamas every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow this so worth coming here !   Even if you have to uber or lift here this place is so good the portions are huge as he**.    We got to met MR Mamma and he was a hoot.  The waitstaff is awesome.  Make sure you come here hungry and get ready to have leftovers."}
{"text":"Nick the owner greeted my wife and I at the door warmly.
Claudia suggested we try the gravy (my wife showed interest in chicken fried steak with the gravy) and we were blown away with the flavors within the gravy.

When the meal came out very shortly after ordering the presentation was beautiful and steak cooked to perfection. What a nice surprise but not much of a surprise after reading their reviews.

Nick has a crew that really cares and have the talent to perform everything from the warm welcome at the door and table to the wonderfully prepared food and delivery. Even the prices are VERY reasonable.

Thank you Nick and Claudia and your amazing cooks!!

Chris & Kim."}
{"text":"Guy from \"Diners Drive-ins and Dives\" needs to visit this restaurant!  Your welcomed at the door by Nick, Owner, and immediately seated by the friendly staff!  You can feel the good energy and smell of incredible homemade food the minute you enter!  Menu is perfect with selections for everyone.  

Smiling faces from the energetic staff and the fresh ingredients make this establishment A MUST while in Las Vegas.  

Organization and good leadership must be what Nick has provided to make such a success!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat and found this place on Yelp. We decided to visit and ... WOW! This place is amazing. To start the hostess is friendly and respectful; definitely a good sign for a place you've never been to. Then, the wait time was right on target, unlike places that say a time and it takes longer; ugh.  We were seated and soon asked to move to a different table before placing our order. Not a problem though.. Kat (manager) asked so politely and apologized that is was no inconvenience. Without asking her she gave us a free cinnamon roll as a thank you. Our waiter Alex was nothing short of the impressive professionalism and kindness of all the other staff. He smiled, answered our questions, and was exceptionally attentive to our needs during our visit. Their menu has a good variety of foods that ordering was difficult because we wanted everything. When our food came out it was perfect! The taste was amazing and the family environment was the icing.. we will definitely be back anytime we're in town! If there were more than 5 stars I'd give it to them!!  Thank you Kat, Alex, cooks and all staff for your great service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for breakfast. Portions are huge and affordable. It's always packed. Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"The Food is always good here
Today I had the Mama Short Stack 
The Owner is always very personable and hospitable......like being at Home"}
{"text":"Mr. Mama* himself will probably greet you as soon as you set foot in his restaurant. Everyone's friendly here and you'll feel right at home at this lunch and breakfast joint. 

*not sure if the man greeting you is actually Mr Mama"}
{"text":"Great food big portions. Customer service is execellent. We will definitely come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and after the first time it took me over a year to return and now they have moved locations. The first time I went it was a weekend and they were busy but there were plenty of wait staff. My husband had the country fried steak and it was good. My meal was forgettable (Greek omelette). 

The second time was a weekday morning and about more than half of the tables were full. I noticed something odd that I couldn't help but pay attention to. There were 8 tables full and 10 plus waiters. It was noticeably odd. Maybe they have a huge crowd come in at lunch and they were preparing for that. Then I thought maybe they have a training or meeting. Well I didn't see that happen either. What bothered me was this. I had a server named Melissa who was MIA our entire meal. We had to flag her down for water, for sugar free syrup, lemon, etc. we had to ask other people to get her because she was in conversations with other workers which did not appear to be work related talk. Upon noticing that I noticed every worker was in groups of 2 or 3 huddling around and talking not even looking at their tables. I could be judging here but honestly it didn't seem professional and I felt like a burden anytime I asked for anything. At one point our waitress rolled her eyes when we had to ask another waiter for the check and he said he would let her know. I'm not sure why she's annoyed when she's not doing her job. She was not the only one though. All I can think is that this kind of behavior is acceptable at this restaurant and chit chat between workers is acceptable as well. 

As for the food- my omelette was called a Spanish omelette and it had mozzarella cheese with spinach and Parmesan cheese with avocado on top. I'm not sure what part was Spanish about it. The hash browns I asked for extra crispy and it was soggy with extra crispy on the outside. Overall my meal was 3 stars but the service was 1 star."}
{"text":"Definitely great for couples to large groups. This is a classic American diner style restaurant where all the staff welcomes and talks to you! Sean is the manager and he goes around taking pictures for you. The food is just good that you would want to return. Jasmine our server is super attentive. Food comes out fast so even if you wait a while for your table you know you will get out fast."}
{"text":"Lordy Lordy my best discovery this visit Mr Mamas!  Don't waste your time on the strip take a short drive to Mr Mamas so worth it.  There was a short 20 minute wait on a Sunday morning but it went by quickly.  We were seated and the friendliest waitress Jazmin came right away to help us got our drinks quickly and then to the breakfast. We ordered chicken fried steak and corned beef hash.  Omg the gravy has sausage and bacon and the steak was a crispy piece of deliciousness.  Not to dry and the gravy was bursting with flavor.  Then best of all on my home fries they let you decide if you want peppers and onions or not my dreams came true I hate picking all that stuff out.  Corned beef hash was scrumptious not too salty and not a ton of potatoes with scrambled eggs it hit the spot.  Must try when in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"The name alone had my curiosity so I stopped in.  There was a little wait but it wasn't bad.  The staff continuously came by to check on everyone while we waited, that's something I can appreciate.  The food was pretty good with a variety of choices of a traditional breakfast.  I would come here again"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on our way back home and I am so glad we did. This place is phenomenal. It's got a nice casual mom and pop look to it and it's bustling with people. Our server was absolutely amazing. Our party was big and many of us couldn't decide what to get so we asked our server for her recommendation and she stayed patient with us while helping each one of us (there were at least 7 people) decide.

As for the food, absolutely delicious. I wish I didn't get full so soon. I wanted to eat my entire breakfast wrap but I just couldn't do it. SO GOOD THOUGH. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone with a voracious appetite and in search of GREAT food."}
{"text":"First time customer. Good portions but hash browns were very greasy. Customer Service was excellent and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Highly recommend!

The service is great starting from the host, to the servers, all the way to the cooks. Our server, Alex, was great and super helpful. We came hungry and left satisfied! My family and I were in town for the weekend and we had never been here before but glad that we found this place! The pancakes are huge and the French toast are delicious. You won't regret coming here! It was packed with plenty other satisfied customers. They said the wait was 25 minutes or so and we were inside in less than 15, definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food came out insanely quickly!! Ordered breakfast burrito with no meat and they were happy to accommodate. Everything tastes great. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty and a great bargain. Had the Cali omelette and a single pancake on the side.   Both very yummy!  Service was excellent and I think it was the owner that was personally checking on tables to make sure we were all good.  Don't come to Vegas often but when I do I'll be having breakfast here again."}
{"text":"My family and I had brunch at the restaurant yesterday while my father in law was recovering at the nearby hospital. The food was EXCEPTIONAL... as was the service!  Everyone who works there is very friendly and they seated us within a reasonable amount of time for our large group. We didn't have to wait long for anything. It was so wonderful,  we went back again today!! 
The coffee was delicious! We had French toast,  hashbrowns,  bacon, biscuits and gravy,  and various sandwiches. The owner was very excitable and appreciative to all the customers. That attitude and great food always makes anyone want to come back!  We will definitely visit this establishment next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Mehhh, just ok. The staff in my opinion was very friendly, but a bit over bearing. One of the waitresses (very nice man) kept asking if I wanted to take a picture. I'm here to eat food....why would I want to take a picture? And I'm a local! Let me eat...anyway, service was good. Just annoying. 

The food was ok. The omelette (Greek) was AMAZING!!!! Other than that, the pancakes were waaay too thick and heavy. Nothing really stood out. The bacon was thin; nothing special. The potatoes were just ok. 

So, three stars for service and the omelette. 

After my review, the owner wrote: \"It's s shame you weren't in the mood for our kind of service\"????? Shaking my head. No disrespect at all to your resturant. I'm simply giving constructive criticism. Some of your employees are too overbearing. Make strides to improve and be professional instead of making comments like this. For the unprofessionalism alone, taking one star off. Ughhhh :-("}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we make time for Mr Mamas!!!!
We never have had a bad meal here!  The biscuits and gravy are to die for!  The gravy is different and yummy.  Walk don't run!!!!"}
{"text":"Always my go to breakfast place when working in Vegas. Always friendly, busy in the weekends so plan accordingly, but still completely accommodating and pleasant. Food is always great and my custom order comes out perfectly every day. Well done bacon? Well they are one of the only places around that makes my bacon well done how I love it. You can rely on these guys to take care of you."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place, I'm so glad they expanded and moved locations so no wait listed. The service here is always amazing. I always get the eggs Benedict and a cup of coffee. It's free refills too! Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The service was great and very friendly but I was unimpressed with the food.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  It was really bad.  I guess the waitress tried to explain what to expect of the sausage gravy but I didn't understand so I went on to order it.  It tasted terrible and I never had terrible sausage gravy before... I couldn't eat it.  My husband got an omelette that was quite plain and tasteless, even though was a southwestern omelette.  With that said, we like our food a little more seasoned so, it might be a good breakfast place for a lot of folks out there, in fact the place was full and people looked pleased... just stay away from the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Food was delicious and came fairly quick. The service was excellent and everyone is very friendly. 1st time here and was not disappointed. Will definitely come here again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I saw all the 5 and 4 stars for this place so was pretty excited about trying it. Came in with a group of 4 on a Tuesday about 1140am. Appeared to be about 4-6 groups waiting. Walked in and asked for a seating time. Was told that it would be at least thirty minutes. Place isn't big but from the front counter you can see the entire eating area. There were at least 6 tables that I counted that were empty or needed busing. I asked why the wait was so long with so many empty tables. The answer I got was that there were many groups ahead. I told the hostess I understood that but why were there so many tables open or just in need of busing? I then asked what the bus time was on each table. The answer I got was that there were groups ahead of me. Again, I stated that I understood that but that if they bused the tables and seated at the open tables there wouldn't be a need of a thirty minute wait time. This was met with the hostess again telling me that there were people ahead of me. So I asked do you mean there are more groups then I can see waiting? The reply was we are busy. 

I'm sorry but there was no excuse I could see that these tables couldn't be cleared and groups seated in a much shorter time than thirty minutes. I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"With the plethora of breakfast / lunch places opening in this area, it's been hard to have one be distinguished from the others. Mr. Mamas does stand out. It's a family-owned and operated restaurant. The manager is the same one that was here the first time we came over 2 years ago. Our server this time was Jenna, the owner's daughter. The service was truly outstanding. Coffee cups would never allowed to get empty. Water glasses never got less than half full. I ordered the Monterey chicken omelette. It's not on the menu but worth asking for. Chicken spinach avocado cheddar cheese mushrooms and more in the omelette. Truly outstanding. My wife had the Mr Mama's short stack which includes two humongous pancakes, a side of scrambled eggs, and bacon. Very filling but somewhat disappointing. Hence 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"With over 1,200+ reviews and an average of 4.5/5 stars , there's not much more to add. I came here with my boo for brunch since it's near his place and I was really craving french toast (having a sweet tooth and all :9). Food is as good as it gets for diner food. We both shared the Cali omelette (egg whites w/ all the fixings- sausage , cheddar jack cheese , pico de gallo , sour cream & avocado). The omelette was fluffy and delish. Our meal also came with crispy hash browns and toast on the side but we were able to switch out toast for french toast for a small price difference. Everything was generously portioned. Food needed a bit of extra seasoning like pepper on the hash browns & Tabasco on the omelette but that's okay. I read other reviews people saying food is \"bland.\" I can't see how breakfast food can be any different or better from what they serve at Mr. Mama's. Seasoning is provided on table anyways for your liking. Compared to places like Egg Works , Mr. Mama's wins for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"From the moment  you walk in, til the time you leave, you're treated like family. The food is wonderful and they give you plenty of it. There is no reason to leave there not stuff (unless you have great control).  If there's a wait, it's well worth it. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This place is a breakfast and lunch place only - closes at 3pm. We stopped here for lunch one weekday. We arrived around 12:30 or so. The seating and service were quick.  We ate burgers and sandwiches. The Mr Mamas burger is huge -- (2) 1/2 lb patties. The Mr Mamas sandwich is turkey, bacon, avocado is also quite large, like all their sandwiches. For light eaters, you can split one and do fine. The give you the choice of fries, rings or salad -- we tried all and were all good, especially the side salad. I think I would try their omelettes the next time -- they look amazing. Can't go wrong with Mr Mamas."}
{"text":"We came here Friday before Labor Day for breakfast. The place didn't look fantastic y at all but it was full. I imagined why. The food was great. And the service too. All portions were big and the prices were very good. I was impressed by the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs. It was a huge meal and the taste was fantastic. It was way much better than any popular diner like Denny's or even IHOP. We will come again for sure."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile but the line is always so long outside. Because of hunger I never waited haha today we went around 130 but they still let us sit down and order. Even though they were closing soon, they did not rush us and make us feel like we had to hurry. I really appreciated that. A friend and I had gotten omelettes and the boyfriend got corned beef hash with breakfast potatoes. They were all pretty good. They all came out in a timely manner. They were constantly checking to see if we needed anything or wanted refills or if our food was okay. Very attentive staff which is also a plus. In terms of breakfast food, it was good but not waiting outside for an hour great tho. I was kind of relieved that I had not waited all those other times we had come here. This place is definitely better than Denny's but not better than some other breakfast places I've tried. If you want a simple omelette or other breakfast foods, come here but if you want a foodgasm, then I wouldn't recommend this place. I'll come again tho if the line isn't long!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 and this place was very accommodating! We all loved our food! Great biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash, burgers, and chili cheese fries! Affordable, clean, and really friendly staff. We're from Arizona and California but would love to come back."}
{"text":"Was there just the other day with friends from Phoenix. Service is still great and the coffee just keeps coming. Nick runs a great spot and his staff are super also. Remind me of a Great Place in Syracuse NY where I was brought up. Keep it up Nick, your doing it well."}
{"text":"We found a gem when we were looking for something other then the typical casino food. The entire staff was amazing. The food was delicious as well. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful experience a Mr. Mamas.  The service is EXCELLENT !  We ordered the corn beef hash with eggs, and hash browns. However, the corn beef has was a little bit salty for me.  Hubby had chicken fried steak with gravy and hash browns, and two sunny side eggs. Also had ONE order of large pancake to go around.  The besy YUMMY warm cinnamon roll was the BOMB of all !  The wait time for Saturday morning for 3 adults and 3 children  took about 1/2 hour."}
{"text":"My mom has been begging us to go to this joint ever since we landed foot in Vegas. I was worried we wouldn't be able to make it to breakfast but we called in and they serve breakfast until closing!
We arrived around 2:30 on a Wednesday. We already felt really bad because they were closing in 30 minutes. However, it was our last chance to eat here and we HAD to try!
First of all, I'm assuming Mr. Mama himself is the one who stood up to greet us at the door, already a gold star in my book.
We ordered a cinnamon roll, two omelettes, and an eggs Benedict. All were delicious, but I think it was the really homey feel that made is enjoy our meal that much more. 
Unfortunately we don't live in Vegas, but will be back if only to eat here! THOSE OF YOU WHO LIVE CLOSE YOU ARE LUCKY!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices and nice, kid friendly people.  What else could a traveling family ask for?  Staying at The Orleans for a cheer competition wasn't impressed with their kid choices.  Yelp delivered big time.  Strip mall restaurant but the staff makes it great.  Everyone left stuffed with the kids asking when we could come back."}
{"text":"I am extremely happy with the food and service.  From the moment one arrives their is someone that opens the door and greats you .   They work as a family to make one feel like at home.  The manager Pat is very kind and friendly and made sure we were pleased with our food and service.  My family was please with everything we ordered and will definitely recommend to friends and will come again."}
{"text":"We tried this place around 8 am and we're greeted by 
The owner which is always good. I ordered the eggs benedict and that was great. My wife order the corn beef hash and it was salty, taste like from a can because it is from the can no finesse in the presentation. My friend order the chicken fried  steak and that was a disappointment the breading was so thick half the weight is flour and needs more taste.  
I think this place has great potential the service is in tune but the food needs some tweaking in taste, layer of flavor. I believe most people don't want big portion for the sake of creating value, they want quality food, scratch cooking with great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here, after reading numerous reviews. This place is off the beaten path.  We took a cab here. I do not know why the place is called MR. MAMAs.  I found the logo rather cute, two men wearing aprons.  This place is locally owned.  

After the short wait, we were provided a table.  

There is a wide variety of food to select from. 
The food portions are pretty big. 

I had the eggs Benedict with spinach, tomatoes &
ham. I made the mistake of ordering a single order of French Toast. Mistake being way too much food. 

The basic orders all come with a large share of hash browns. I mean the serving could easily serve 2 people. 

The food was very tasty, the hash browns can be ordered crispy. Which is what we had. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked. Nice & runny on the yolk. The spinach and tomatoes were fresh. I easily filled up on the food.  Barely had room for the French Toast.  Now the French Toast had the right seasoning of cinnamon &
Powdered sugar   The bread was perfectly golden brown & fluffy.  

Don't order too much food. The food won't fit on your table. We had to place some of the food on other dishes. 

Oh yeah their iced coffee with chocolate is pretty good as well.  

Great food & prices!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, good prices! You may have to wait since there's a line but very well worth it! Huge pancakes!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to hit in Vegas for breakfast...on week days. Weekends are too busy. The menu has a great variety, staff is super friendly, and service is quick. Real cornbeef hash! Not the canned mushy stuff. Everything I have tried wad great!"}
{"text":"My first time here wasn't such a bad experience. Customer service was great and made sure we were satisfied the whole time we were there. The food I got was alright, it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. The one my friend had was really good she said, although it took them a while to get our food.... like maybe 40 minutes and it wasn't packed or anything but we will come back."}
{"text":"Yelp got this one right good coffee and a great breakfast. Place was very busy and far away from the Vegas tourist traps."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant, it was immediately obvious about how attentive the staff was to their customers. My father managed to scrape his leg somewhere between the car and the entrance. Right when we sat down a staff member noticed the fresh minor cut on my dad's leg and checked to see if there is anything he could do to help. A couple extra napkins later we ordered out meal and a few short moments later our meal arrived. I was incredibly impressed about the prompt service in a busy establishment. Every employee was personable. However, Mr. Mamas doesn't deserve five stars for personality; it's the food itself that makes this place a must go for breakfast. Usually, I'm very hesitant to order steak before noon. At most breakfast places \"steak\" means cheap n' chewy. This was far from the case. Every bite was savory and succulent. Even though they brought A1 steak sauce, it was far from necessary. In the end, the bill was affordable and everyone left satisfied. It is easily the best way to start the day in Vegas. Next time we go to Vegas, best believe we will make a visit to Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast off of the strip hands down. When this place says it gives you a home cookin feel, it most definitely does. The service was excellent, we got greeted by a cool friendly dude who had to handle the mass traffic. I went in there on a Monday like around 12 and it still took us 20 minutes to get sat. The locals rave about this place and it's packed so it's a good situation. Our server was real cool and attentive. I asked her what was the commotion about and she recommended the Mamas special which is the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 turkey bacon and hash browns for $10. So I'm all in. The food takes the normal 20 minutes to make and it comes out looking all outstanding. Fluffy buttermilk pancakes with the perfect texture and sweet taste. The eggs and hash browns were seasoned and garnished with great flavor. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly to the point before it becomes overtly crispy. I ate everything in it's entirety. Great Customer Service all around and if you're a baseball fan you can talk all day with Mr. Mama himself about your team vs his Detroit Tigers. Good food and good peoples."}
{"text":"Yummy Breakfast, worth the drive from the Strip. Hubby had the corned beef hash; and it truly was homemade and great. I tried the Cali omelet, very yummy, loved the pico and the avocado, at 4 eggs it's was way more than I could eat, so I brought the left overs back and it was enough for our breakfast the next day. 
Prices; much better than the strip. Both had home fries they reminded me of perfectly done French fries, just bite size.
Wait; was told 20 minutes, were seated in less than 10.
Portions; very generous 
My only reason for not giving 5 stars was that my hubby witnessed an interaction between someone in back (appeared to be owner) and a waitress, he wasn't very nice in the way he spoke to her and when she came out of the back area she was not smiling, this bothered us. We own a business and always treated all our employees with dignity & love, it bothers us to see someone treated rudely.   
Not sure we'll return but it's a maybe right now."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio y la comida es de calidad. Combinado con buenos precios lo hace una muy buena opción para comer en cualquier momento"}
{"text":"Best place in Las Vegas and it's only 2 mins from my place. The staff is very nice and they are fast. I don't sit down and eat, I just order my food and pick up, due to being crowded all the time."}
{"text":"This  place  was GREAT the service and the food was homemade cooking straight from the kitchen. If your  ever  in  Las Vegas check this place out also the coffee is so good!! Prices are very reasonable. Like this place so much I will be coming back everytime I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We made a quick stop at Mr. Mama's for breakfast on our way to Utah, it was a great decision! I would describe this place as simple,  tasty, down-to-earth, & well-priced. I got the mushroom & cheese omelet with hash browns, and my wife got the Armando wrap. A solid meal all around."}
{"text":"I decide to try this place out because of their rating and was not disappointed! Even though the restaurant was very busy I was served with in ten minutes of being seated. The food was delicious and the entire staff worked together fluidly to make sure that the patrons where taken care of. Will definitely be visiting Mr. Mamas again in the near future!"}
{"text":"saw mr.mamas sign off jones on the way home  from my dentist.  my favorite meal is breakfast and it is so rare to find a good breakfast in vegas area after ten or eleven a.m.  immediately greeted as we entered the front door by shawn with the tatoos. big smile, friendly thought he was an owner. extremely friendly atmosphere from front counter ladies, waittress even customers. our waitress jackie was so nice, attentive.  the food was amazing"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Las Vegas, I was looking for a good breakfast place and tried Mr Mamas first.  I'm pretty sure I ate here for about 7 of the first 12 days I was here.  It was amazing every time!  The staff and owner are super friendly!  It is easily the best breakfast place I've tried!

BUT...

I felt it was only fair to give the other places around Vegas a try.  I know that the food in this city can be incredible.  My girlfriend and I went to Baby Stacks and Egg Works and although they were good, nothing compared to Mr Mamas.  For me personally, it is hands down easily the best!!"}
{"text":"After going here for a late breakfast today....I realize why the 5 stars on yelp!  :)

Everything I had was delicious! :)  I was hungry and EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING sounded delicious on their menu. ;) so many choices!  Lol

The ambiance was what u would expect....no booths but it felt like diner to me. :)  very cute and very cozy.  :)

The staff was very attentive without being intrusive.  I hate it when the waitstaff hovers over u. The staff was there whenever I needed them but they did not intrude on my time with my friend.  So it was good to be able to talk without being constantly interrupted.  :)

Now onto the food. I was hungry so I ordered a little bit of everything.  Lol

Grits were delicious!  Totally made this southern girls day!  Creamy with just the right amount of salt to season it.  They offered me extra butter for it and come on butter makes everything better!  Lol

Biscuits and gravy...seriously one of the best I've had it was soooo good....just thinking about it makes me want to eat it again. I'm drooling just thinking about it. ;)

Corned beef and hash...I love love corned beef....lol I got the hashbrowns extra crispy based off the the reviews that I read on yelp and they did not disappoint.  It was crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  Yummilicious! The eggs were perfectly cooked and the corned beef was delicious.  They left it on the griddle long enough for the corned beef to build texture so it was melt in your mouth in the middle mixed with crunchy from the bits from the edges that were perfectly browned on the edges. 

In other words YES I will definitely be back.  The other breakfast places better watch out....cuz Mr. Mamas is gonna be stealing some customers!  Lol"}
{"text":"We just ate here for breakfast and it was awesome! Great staff! Great food! Being from New Orleans it's hard to find good food away from home but Mr Mamas has so much to offer on the menu and they don't hold back on flavor! The owner was so friendly and gave us great tips on how to enjoy this city!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I came to this place for breakfast. Food was really good but what really stood out was the service. The people here are awesome! Love that good customer service. Would be back."}
{"text":"My son was graduating and wanted to go for breakfast afterwards. Didn't want to go to any of the overrated places. So I turned to Yelp and found Mr Mama's. Decided I would give it a try. Had a party of 10 and this place was fantastic. The service was spot on. Everyone helped out. Not just my table but everyone's. From a party of 2 to a party of 10 everyone seemed to get the same warm welcome and great service. The owner Nick (by form of a loud announcement which was awesome) congratulated my son on his graduation and \"bestowed upon him\" a cinnamon roll  (which was delicious). 

Now to the good stuff--THE FOOD. Every single thing that we got was delicious. Now with 10 people we got to try a lot of dishes. The gravy-out of this world. It has bacon and sausage-nuff said. My mom had a lunch plate with onion rings on it (I stole one when she wasn't looking ) best one I've had in a long time. I had the chicken fried steak and it was probably the best one I have ever had here in Vegas. Everyone else loved the food as well. 

Thanks Mr Mama from this Mama for making my sons meal a great one!"}
{"text":"One of the best things outside the strip in vegas, we had patty melt,veggie wrap(egg) and french toast .french toast was so soft  and yummy , wrap was hot and yumm .. gud option for veggies.. even patty melt was great , as i like less strong coffee it was perfect for me .. they even gave one for take out .very cordial and helpfull staff ,my kid needed bottle warmed and they made sure it happens .. will surely come back ..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, good service and great portions! Very popular place, had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table but well worth it. Much better than blueberry hill which I always used to go to, just wished this place was open late nights"}
{"text":"This is an easy review to write, because this place is awesome!  Great food and an incredibly friendly staff made this a good find.  Home fries are a must, not greasy at all and delicious.  Pancakes inflate in your stomach and are huge, which the waitress warned me about.  But their light and soak up syrup.  Some of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had.  Get off the Strip and get to Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here this morning and it was delicious! We were welcomed at the door and when seated, all of our chairs were pulled out. Our server Alex was very accommodating and came at just the right times. He also recommended things for our orders and was always kind. The food was outstanding and reasonably priced. We definitely will be back, it was a great neighborhood breakfast place."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service. Would definitely come back here, we had five people in our group and everyone loved their breakfast and it came out FAST!"}
{"text":"Was visiting and checked out Yelp for a breakfast place that wasn't in a Casino. Me Mamas was awesome. Walked in at 9:00 was seated immediately. Good thing we arrived when we did because they started getting really busy. But the employees were efficient and they were seating people as soon as possible. Our waitress Jenna was so nice, attentive and helpful with all our questions. Great experience and will definitely go back the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday late morning. The wait was about 25 minutes. The food was very good, portions were big, staff was very friendly, and most importantly the prices were what they should be! If you have a car, I recommend coming here for breakfast or brunch and you'll save yourself a fortune compared to the strip, then you can parlay that savings ;)"}
{"text":"I really had an awsome experience here today.  The food was so delicious.  if you ever come to Vegas, it's a must place to eat.  I had the mama burger.  It's a pound of awesomeness.   The service is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Good honest food and lots of it, efficient effective staff, and attentive management."}
{"text":"Awesome find!  Omelets are HUGE and delicious.  We had great service - expect a wait, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Great  breakfast ! Delicious cinnamon roll! Got seated right away. Very fast service."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, worth the Uber ride from the strip! My eggs Benedict was delicious and my husband's French toast was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! 
Food was good and the atmosphere is really low key. Friendly. Treated us well. 
My boys had the pancakes. Loved them. I had the corned beef hash. Not bad. 
I will be back as I hear the Chicken Fried Steak is really good. 
Thanks for a good meal with my sons!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great! Wait staff was awesome and everyone was so friendly. The bus staff was on it every minute. Awesome food, service and atmosphere. We had the sausage omelet and the French toast.. So yummy..Will tell everyone about it!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent was greeted right away and ordered french toast with eggs and bacon and hubby ordered ham and cheese omelette and fries, fries were really good, everything tasted great!  Will be coming back next time"}
{"text":"Listen . . . If you are looking for a great breakfast to start your day while in Las Vegas, look no more.

I instantly added them to my elite list of Top 5 favorite breakfast experiences. I'm a Midwest girl and we love our big portions. I've never had so much food before!! The pancakes are bigger than the size of my head. And . .the waitress let us substitute the toast that comes with the meal for one pancake. What??! No one has ever let me do that! No up charge I asked. . . with a smile the server answered to my surprise \"no\".
And . . . You can order one pancake or one piece of French toast if you want.

I had chicken fried steak- bigger than my face too - with some of the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted! And that's saying a lot because my parents are from the South and I've had my share of gravy.

The food was great but so was the service! From the time we walked in the door to the steps we took leaving, the hostess and wait staff was very attentive to our every need. My husband's coffee cup was never empty, my soda was strong and always topped off.

Just simply amazing! We are big fans and will always visit Mr. Mamas for a great meal!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in the mood for breakfast off of the strip..we decided to take an Uber here and try it..as we walked inside, the way was a true 35min. We didn't mind because of the patrons looking as if they were enjoying..the host was extremely nice! Once seated, I got the pancakes with eggs, bacon, and I ordered a side of potatoes to share! Beyond excellent!!! I had about 2 cups of fresh coffee! My fiancé had French toast with sausage and eggs..he didn't like them as much as the pancakes!! We were full the entire day!!! Serious! No need for dinner for the both of us! Will forever come here whenever we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Cali and we came across Mr. Mamas. All I gotta say is this place is wonderful! Great service, great food, and reasonably priced. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in Vegas. We were treat well at Mr. Mamas. :)"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, (service is good), since when a lot of food means good food? I ordered the Rib Eye (medium rare) with eggs and potatos, the steak was cold, bad combination it felt like I was chewing on a fresh road kill deer, cold and raw, the pancakes look alot more like a Dish antenna than a pancake and they are heavy and tasteless, we came for the \"good\" reviews, my mistake, I would totally recommend this place to my worst enemy...."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I ordered the French toast with eggs and sausage, my brothers ordered steak and eggs."}
{"text":"We took our bunch (two adults and two toddlers) there based on some reviews. Everyone was super friendly. Some of the folks that work there look sketchy (lots of tattoos and a vaguely just-out-of-jail look) but everyone was nice and treated us with respect. 

We ordered two meals (the littles ate off of our plates) and three juices. The food was really good. My partner tried the chili cheese omelet (he raved about it) and I got the steak and eggs. I was pleased that they were able to scramble my eggs correctly (soft scramble with onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes) but the steak was nothing to rave about. 

Overall, I'd say it was a positive experience. The meal set us about about $40 which surprised me but the food was good so I'm not upset."}
{"text":"First i would like to mention that the service by itself deserves 5 stars! They tended to us very well. Whenever we need a refill of coffee or water,they were there to refill them! Very very nice. The food was good,especially for the price. Me and my GF both got steak and eggs and the food was definitely satisfying! I will definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"Great taste and healthy too.  Been coming for years and I've never had an issue.  Quick go-to for lunch. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"excellent food, superb customer service, KILLER prices! go go go go go!!!! highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty packed when we walked in on a Friday morning. We almost left because of all the people but then saw it was just a big party and our wait would be about 15 min. You have to place your name on the waitlist Sean was the one to take our names, he was great.  And since they have have menus on the counter we were able to see what we wanted while we waited.  

Once seated we ordered and food came out about 10 mins laters.  Everyone was so busy but they always ensured we had everything we needed. The service was amazing.  It was so refreshing to have a place with great tasting food and great service.  

The breakfast comes in large portions for a great price as well.  My son ordered the mama short stack and couldn't finish it.  The pancakes are the size of the whole plate.  I got the Mamas French toast with strawberries and whip cream and it was so filling.  

Overall i would recommend this to anyone.  Thank you Jose for the great service as well!!"}
{"text":"A very good breakfast spot.  Probably one of the best I have been to in Las Vegas.  Service is always great.  I always come before 8am on weekends so I have never encountered a wait.

Food is solid and yummy, but if you're a biscuits and gravy or CFS kind of person their gravy is a bit different so give it a try first.

The service really makes this spot stick out.  They will go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Greek wrap, French toast,   Jenna, Cali omelette. Our server was Jazmin. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time in here and they are amazing. Everybody is so nice, they make you feel really comfortable and the food is really good. I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing! The Service was phenomenal from the moment we walked in the door. The food was awesome. I had the Spanish omelette made with eggs whites (bikini season :)) so tasty. The avocado on top of the omelette was super fresh. Coffee was great. Thanks Mr. Mamas, we'll be back tomorrow or breakfast!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our service and our meal. This is a spot you must visit for a resonance and delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's is my favorite breakfast place in town.  Ever since my best friend showed me at the old location, I've been coming back. They recently moved a street over not too long ago that's bigger. 

The owner always greets us making sure we feel welcomed and the service is excellent. 

Atmosphere makes it feel at home.

I usually order the Cali Omelet with home fries and sourdough bread. My friend got the Chicken Fried Steak with the same sides. It's inexpensive which is great since the portions are quite large and everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has a great owner and staff! So friendly and the food is delicious. Fresh squeezed orange juice, can never go wrong! Celebrated my brothers birthday breakfast here! Worth a 20 min drive for us !"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Friendly and efficient staff.  My husband is very picky about his pancakes and he liked the pancake here quite well.  I asked for extra crispy hash browns. When they  arrived  they weren't  very crispy but I was asked  if they were crispy enough.  I said, \"no,\" and I received crispy hash browns right away-surpisingly fast.  I would return.  Also great value for the price!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we were able to locate this place. It was about a 15 minute drive off Tropicana, north of the Mandalay Bay. The wait for 2 of us was about 20 minutes. Most of the patrons looks like they were locals which is a good sign. The lady taking names was very personable. She asked everyone leaving how their meal was. Very nice!

The service was quick. The food was simply amazing. I mean you really can't go bad with eggs and bacon but they make it very fresh and tasty. This place is even better than the Omelette House. Don't eat casino food which are gross."}
{"text":"Always great food and service here! Came here this morning and it was very busy but still great service.  They had a party of 30 come in, but still managed to seat us and everyone else that was waiting.  Yes, the wait was a little long...but so worth it!!! Even with it being as busy as it was our server still made it special for our daughter who just turned 3 by putting extra whipped cream on her pancakes and they all sang to her and brought an amazing cinnamon roll out to her!

My only suggestion to them would be to start looking for an even bigger location because they are gonna need it if they continue with the great food and amazing service!!"}
{"text":"Convenient breakfast spot with lots of locals so you know it's good.  Large portions, friendly staff & quick service.  Was just what we were looking for."}
{"text":"First time in here. We'll be back to Vegas in September and we are for sure coming back to eat here. It was the BEST! Customer service 5 stars"}
{"text":"All we can say is this place is AMAZING! The service was awesome and even better its affordable and tasty. If i could give more stars I would."}
{"text":"The Mamas French Toast was awesome!  The service was wonderful. The wait wasn't long...they are very organized and try to seat people quickly.  The host was very friendly."}
{"text":"If your looking for a hip hipster diner, this place is not for you. This place is a great casual old school diner. Down to earth, friendly diner with good food.

Stopped by as we passed vegas on our way to Utah. We wanted a nice casual breakfast for a family of 7. We were greeted right away. My grandfather is handicapped and walks super slow but they made sure that he didn't have to rush which was nice. The owner mentioned he had several surgeries so he understands the struggle. 

We ordered a variety of dishes to show my grandma what American breakfast is like and I think she really enjoyed it! We ordered a mr MaMa breakfast 3 pancakes, 3 eggs with sausages, veggie omelette, breakfast burrito, chicken fried steak, egg benedict, and Mr MaMa burger for 7 people. 

My grandma enjoyed the Egg Benedict and was hogging it even tho we were suppose to be sharing. I enjoyed the egg veggie egg omelette because I wanted something lighter and it was perfect. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. My brother enjoyed their breakfast burrito and burgers and my dad enjoyed the chicken fried steak. 

Service was great in general, they did their best to make us comfortable and feel welcomed. The coffee was constantly refilled and waiters were very tentative.  

Great place to stop by for super casual breakfast or brunch when your not looking for anything fancy!

{"text":"Customer service is on point here! They have someone to open the door for customers. We came here on a Wednesday morning so it wasn't that busy, the hostess saw us coming in and she immediately directed the other host to go set up a table, then she led us to the table that's already been set up for us. 

I got a veggie omelette with home fries, and my friend got pancakes with bacon and scrambled eggs. The portion was big we didn't finish our food, but the food was delicious and we boxed it for later."}
{"text":"Food was good. Server was nice (young beautiful spanish lady) always checking up on us!! Reason for 4 star was because my husbands order didnt taste homemade but it was still good. We'd definitely come back if we are on that side of town."}
{"text":"Good, fast service. Clean place and food was great. Best hash browns I have ever had. Staff is friendly and helpful and the place is ran very efficiently. Will definitely be back again and will make this a must stop place when I'm in town.

PS the french toast was pretty kick ass too. ;-)"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers, so glad we came here for breakfast. The hubby and I ordered lots of food but every single thing was good. We're talking like 6 or 7 things (counting sides). Will definitely return when we're back in town."}
{"text":"Traditional breakfast that is delicious is what this place is. We came here about a month ago and when we saw the line out the door, well let's just say we didn't feel like waiting. I'm happy to say that I am so happy we decided to give this place another try today. No line today (thank goodness!) We were sat at a table right away, our waitress was there waiting on us to take our drink order. The menu was simple, which I loved. I had the biscuits and gravy which turned out to be a great choice. Two homemade biscuits slathered in gravy and sausage with a hint of syrup. Absolutely delicious! The hospitality was just through the roof. I can't say enough how everyone that works there was so nice. Hospitality and great food = 5 stars"}
{"text":"When I come to Vegas every year, I look forward to checking out small local places off The Strip. And this one is definitely a winner! We visited the restaurant late Monday morning, and it was just about busy. We barely had to wait 3 minutes before we were seated. The staff are really efficient and kept the tables cleared very quickly, which meant you'd most probably not have to wait very long!

I had the French Toast with two sunnyside up's and turkey bacon on the side. No complaints. My friend had the Eggs Benedict Florentine and was very happy with the eggs and hollandaise sauce. Our portions were just about right which was great! Denisse served us and was such a darling, making sure everything was perfect during the meal. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service and staff. The food is awesome. We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and was told that our group of 4 had about a 40 min wait. We almost left and glad we didn't. We only waited about 20 min. Our food service was fast. The our waitress accommodated my substitution without a problem. And to top it off we had our picture taken and didn't have to ask."}
{"text":"We stopped here after reading the reviews and it does not disappoint. Though they are known for their chicken and gravy (maybe some other specialties?) we just wanted some simple breakfast. Buttermilk pancakes huge and very good. Simple eggs. Bacon. Sausage. All standard and good. Wouldn't say they are better than any other good breakfast joint. Kind of divey. Open floor-table seating.  Feels like a cafeteria. Quick service. Super friendly staff. I think there is always a wait. Because of its popularity. So give yourself some time.  Wouldn't call it great and wouldn't  go out of my way to go back. It was all around good."}
{"text":"Was great service, everybody was as friendly as could be as u walked in the door!! Food was very very good as well recommended this for anybody.. Cinnamon roll"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  The biscuits and gravy is super yummy.  It is different from any other places I have eaten.  The owners are so friendly you are instantly feeling like family even after your first visit.  The staff is friendly and attentive and I could not ask for more.  Great place for a weekend breakfast or if you lucky enough mid week too."}
{"text":"Not much to say that others haven't said. Great food and friendly service. The new location is pretty big so you don't end up waiting that long unless you have a big party. My only minor complaint was that the pancakes weren't anything special. The omelet we had was amazing and the quality of bacon was excellent though."}
{"text":"Wow!  The food is good but the service is great. I was amazed to see everyone with a smile and always checking on us to see if we are doing fine. We are coming back for sure.

Me. Mama's - please keep this formula. It definitely works."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas, tried this small place around the corner and will be coming back. Staff is super friendly. I ordered a breakfast burrito and substituted avocado for meat which I thought was very nice. This place is poppin, busy the whole time we were here and you can call ahead to put your name on the list."}
{"text":"** Note 5 stars mainly for Shawn's customer service **

Have to give a shout out to Shawn! He was the greeter/host that called out your name if it was on the waiting list. He was hilarious. He called one parties name out a few times within the restaurant, with no one responding he then proceeded outside and was calling that parties name as he walked down the sidewalk for what sounded like a quarter mile. He was very animated and really seemed like he enjoyed his job.

The food we tried was also great but being on a low carb diet, I wasn't able to try what I really wanted on the menu ( biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak, etc...). Would recommend based on what I saw others eating."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my boyfriend on our way to our hotel, the service was phenomenal from the second we stepped in. A sweet man opened the door for my boyfriend and I, and our waitress Claudia was so sweet and helpful, not to mention patient with all the questions we asked her. She even went out of her way to let us try their amazing gravy. We are honestly so impressed with the genuine good service we will definitely be back whenever we make our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was really good.  Loved the workers, they were very friendly and polite. Definitely coming back to this place anytime I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Loved it. Were starving from a transatlantic flight and found it off the strip at a reasonable price, large portion sizes, and great tasting. Really enjoyed the cali and greek omelets. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My parents and I came here after looking on Yelp for an off the strip breakfast place. We figured there would be a little wait on a Saturday morning, but it was only 20 minutes. When we first walked in we were greeted by Shawn and he took our name down. He was so nice and polite and made the wait worth while. We were seated and greeted by our server almost instantly. The great service really is a huge part of the culture here and it shows in every aspect. 
The food was delicious as well. My mom and I split the biscuits and sausage gravy with hash browns. The gravy was so good and I usually don't care for it. My only advice would be to get the hash browns well done if you like them crispy. We also shared 1 pancake on the side and the server was so sweet because she let us get the special pancake like the sign said with chocolate chips and strawberries. 
Overall, the experience was great, the service was great, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Just kind of okay. The burrito was bit bland and the salsa wasn't all that great, my wife's hash browns were unseasoned, the coffee was just so so. The service was excellent though. It's just your typical last generation diner."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Ordered a mushroom and sausage omelet and corn beef hash and eggs. The corned beef was homemade and crispy. The omelet was flavorful. The ice coffee was mediocre but free refills! Would come back again."}
{"text":"Lived up to billing.  You can get twice the food that is half as good for twice the price at a popular buffet, but why???!  This place had the taste."}
{"text":"Such a great find, can't wait to go back! 

Super friendly staff, great food, great prices and a massive menu. 
Literally can't ask for better. 

I actually kinda wish they were open right now..."}
{"text":"My son and I went to breakfast here today for the first time .  I read the reviews and yes I have to agree , service is great .  I like the guy opening the door and welcoming us .  Reminded me of when I am home in the Carolinas .  The waitress was nice and came back several times for refills and check on us which is rare in Las Vegas .  I love grits so I had to try theirs , cooked just right and a good sized bowl unlike most places if they even have them .  The chicken fried steaks was ok and the gravy was good , think , and chunky .  I will probably do the biscuits and gravy next time .  3 eggs and potatoes to fil you up .  My son had a large pancake which was fluffy and pretty good , but IHOP has an edge there .  I would recommend this place and will go again ."}
{"text":"I come from Cali stayed the weekend in Vegas and honestly would eat here every day of my stay. They have an outstanding customer service team, price range, and great food. I fell in love with their homemade ranch! If you come to Vegas, you must try this place ! 100/10"}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas: Las Vegas

Off the beaten path, Mr. Mamas great for breakfast, lunch, or just a quick bite. Hours of operation 6:00 a.m, to 3:00p.m. 1st time eating here. As we walked up to the restaurant, there was someone friendly who  had opened the door to welcome us in. The spacious set up of tables and friendly service made it comfortable. The servers were friendly, attentive, and diligent in assisting us. We would highly recommend this place. We shared the chicken fried steak. It was by far one of the best we've had. The server also brought us a small bowl of sausage gravy....delicious! They also separated our meal into two plates without an extra charge. All in all, we highly enjoyed our meal, and just the right portion as we were about to be in the car for four hours. 

Military friendly: no extra discount"}
{"text":"I love this place! When I was pregnant I was always craving Chicken Fried Steak and this was the only place I liked. They use real sausage gravy and the home style potatoes with peppers and onions are so good. 
The service is outstanding. The owner is always there and you can tell he respects his employees and appreciates his customers. Your cup never gets below half way and they wait staff is always on their toes. Whenever I want delicious home style food I go here. One of the only places in town that I enjoy and frequent."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! Everything (and I mean everything) is soo good!! The servers also pride themselves in great service!"}
{"text":"For breakfast/brunch aficionados--Mr. Mamas' is it.  Even if you're married to a guy who hates eggs, like I am.  The menu offers plenty of fresh breakfast options, the restaurant is flexible with customizing/modifying ingredients to your liking, and it's not all breakfast.  If I were a local, I would be here weekly.  Sadly, since I am not, Mr. Mama's has become a MUST visit when we're in the area and a place to recommend to friends.

SERVICE
+The staff is friendly-super chill. On a four day trip, we ate here twice.  On our second visit the hostess remembered us- little things go a long way.  
+Table service- very attentive without being overbearing.  Your coffee cup will not go unfilled, they have a specific person who only does drinks, used plates are immediately removed.  For a casual unassuming place, the quality of service was a pleasant surprise.  

FOOD
+AMAZING  This is definitely my favorite breakfast spot in the US.  Their website boasts how they \"put a smile on your face\"-- they do.  You'll want to work your way through the menu.  

2 Eggs and Toast $4.50  (5 STARS)
+Eggs cooked to your preference, select from 5 different types of toast (sourdough for me), fresh home fries are also included (add peppers and/or jalapenos for my fellow spice lovers)  

Pancakes  (5 STARS)
+Order a single, short stacks (2), stacks (3), pancakes (2)  Buttery, fluffy, light, warm, delectable, perfection

Cinnamon Roll  (4.5 STARS)
+It does not disappoint.  Cinnamon rolls are freshly made, served on the small plate, airy, light... My husband LOVED it.  He particularly appreciated how the cinnamon roll wasn't too dense. 

French Toast (5 STARS)
+Choose from a plethora of options-1, 2, 3 with bacon, sausage, ham, etc.  

I want to try the:
+Breakfast burritos
+Omelets (they're huge-fit the plate) served with sides
+I'm eying the BLT and Mamas Sandwich (Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Pepperjack cheese- select your bread)

What I wish:
+That they had fresh juices... just a thought! ;o)

PRICE
Pricing is reasonable. It's also nice to get away from the Strip tourist traps and buffets."}
{"text":"Services are so good! Workers are all so passionate and nice. Tried the Cali omelette and Marty wrap! Rich ingredients and not too salty! recommended! Such a homie restaurant, made my day!"}
{"text":"Mr Mama's is such a great little place to go eat. The food is yummy but more importantly the service is wonderful. Our waitress was on top of everything, poured more coffee, fresh drinks when needed cleared plates when done etc. 
It was very evident that they have excellent management. Would definitely eat here again if I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best in Vegas. Always friendly. Delicious food. Prices are very reasonable. The hash brows and bacon are sooo good. When I'm forced to eat anywhere else I'm always disappointed now and think o myself its not Mr Mamas"}
{"text":"The best around any where in Las Vegas and I go there every time I get to go.  Love to eat at MrMamas.  Great food and service with a wonderful atmosphere!
5 star !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite breakfast/lunch place to go to after work. Everything here is homemade, delicious and amazing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The wait staff are wonderful. The owner is very friendly and always ensuring you have a great experience. Superb place!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast. Best coffee and came piping hot! Biscuits and gravy melts in your mouth. The biscuits were not day old stale! The wait is long, but let that stop you!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Servings are plenty the food taste great.. The customer service is wonderful. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The manager noticed that I was super tired and they brewed and extra strong pot to wake me up. They were so super friendly making sure that we were completely  satisfied. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome great fantastic.  This place is a must try.  Staff are very attentive. Delicious food. My wife and I both left with a smile!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this highly rated breakfast eatery, and I enjoyed every second of it. The staff was very attentive, friendly, and professional. The Manager Kat made sure that everything was going well, and made us feel very welcome. I now know why this restaurant is so well rated. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get breakfast when in LV. Since we were here last (3 years ago) they've moved, but same great service and food. Still our breakfast tradition."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast foods that lived up to the hype on Yelp. Place was busy and the service was excellent. Multiple people checked with my wife and I on food and drinks. She had the Veggie Omelette with fresh Avocado and a pancake. I went with the Cinnamon roll - fresh, with perfect sweetness and A LOT of cinnamon. The pancake was perfectly cooked, light and fluffy - one of the best I've ever had. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast. I'm partial to the benedict, but everything I've tried has been good. Avoid the rush times, we've had the shortest wait for a table arriving around 12:39 or 1 since they close at 2."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The owner could not have been more friendly and has lots of great stories to tell. The food was downright srumdittlyumptious. We were seated fast, we did have a hiccup in our order but they quickly fixed the problem and were very apologetic."}
{"text":"The wait time 20-30 minutes. Friendly staff.  However, the biscuits and gravy were not up to my standards.  Gravy was too thick, lacked proper seasoning & biscuits were to soft & almost mushy from the weight of the gravy."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast theres not a lot you can mess up. But being a breakfast joint in Las Vegas, I can honestly say there are better places out there. I had the country fried steak and eggs, nothing too spectacular. My brother in law had their 'homemade' corned beef hash and as he said it could've done with more corned beef and less of the hash. All in all the service was great but the food, not so much."}
{"text":"Was sadly disappointed by the 5 star rating. It was a solid place but nowhere near 5 star. 

When I arrived and walked in I was most aggressively greeted and asked all kinds of questions. It was quite the barrage: a table for one? Are you getting take out? Are you waiting for someone? I was just making sure so we can help you... All that before: hello how are you? (Which never happened) 

I was waiting for a friend before seating, so I just walked outside to wait. It would have been better to be asked: dine in or take out? How many in your party and would you like to wait? 

My friend arrived. We were sat right away by someone else. We were able to get drinks right away. We got the special of strawberry pancakes, drink and eggs for $9 plus we got a side of hash browns. All good at this point. 

Then things started going... Not well. We had a hair in the coffee cup, my eggs came in wrong (ordered over medium got scrambled) and when the runner/ server came back to give me the new eggs she handed me the plate instead of helping me to find a place on our crowded table to set it down. 

The strawberry pancakes had thinly sliced strawberries, about 4-5 slices on each large pancake. Not even a full strawberry on each plate. Maybe one strawberry for both our orders put together. And there were 4 pancakes. We asked for more and they brought them. No big deal. Seems like it should have come with more than 1/2 strawberry each order.

The food was not amazing, but not terrible. The staff were nice about the mistakes and that made up for some, but the hair was a real bummer. That just turns my stomach. I give this place a C/C+."}
{"text":"Great food great service recommend the chicken fried steak! Worth the wait. This will be on my to go list next time we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"This food was spot on. If you're here in Las Vegas for EDC, you MUST come eat here!!! This place has my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"A break fast only place usually exist cause it's good or it's the only place open.

The omelette is good but should contain more cheese.

Hash browns were meh. Rye bread was tasty and same for French toast.

Not bad at all and affordable price. Easy parking too. A"}
{"text":"I came in to pick up an order last week and  the place was packed at 8 a.m. but the service was friendly and efficient and the food was delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing establishment! Service is outstanding. Came in a Saturday morning around 830 and only had a 20 min wait. Ordered the country fried steak. Their gravy is thick with tons of bacon in it! So good! The breaded steak is great! Man, lived t all. 

Fiancé ordered mommas stack and it was good! He added whip creams and strawberries to it. Look delicious. Picture perfect. Everyone is so friendly and patient."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff.  I would recommend you order the hashbrowns, seasoned to perfection and quite tasty!  Well worth the 40 minute wait!"}
{"text":"Wow! Hearty breakfast for a great price. Be prepared to wait for a table because this place is popping. Food was prepared to order but came out quickly.  Great customer service from the greeters to servers. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"First off hats off to a wonderful management and service team. We stopped here while our exploring the area and we were not disappointed. We were greeted with enthusiasm and smiles. There was a small wait but wasn't more then a few minutes with a larger party in front of Us exceeded our expectations. Once we were seated we ordered a little bit of everything on the breakfast side. We had the Cali omelet which was moist and perfectly done. We also ordered the biscuits and gravy which has some bacon in there with the sausage and was excellent. The egg Benedict had perfectly poached eggs that accompanied the hollandaise sauce which I couldn't get enough of. The potatoes with peppers and onion on the side were a excellent accompaniment. We will definitely be back next time we are in town and not only cause of the wonderful service but we want to try more off the menu. Thank you again till next time."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! Chicken fried steak with pancakes and hash browns. Could not have been a better breakfast. And you wouldn't even know this small little local place was there!! So glad I found it. Service was really great, food was delicious!! Eat here once and you will likely return.

Not on or near the Vegas strip. Drive there anyway. Its way way WAY better than the food at the hotels!!"}
{"text":"I believe that the owner of Mr. Mamas wrote the book on customer service. The staff treat you like royalty and the food is excellent. If you want a delicious affordable meal off the strip, Mr. Mamas is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite breakfast place. The staff, Alex especially, is so accommodating and friendly. The food is so flavorful, the best biscuits and gravy I have ever tasted and the restuarant itself is immaculate. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious, super fast, reasonable prices, and friendly people too!?!  I'm not a big breakfast guy but this place is great."}
{"text":"This breakfast place not only has the best friendly service in a modest family dining space, the food is spot on. I don't think I have ever had better prepared eggs, hashbrowns and toast in my life.  It was the perfect meal before driving back home. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"What a great find. The reviews are well deserved. Excellent service, great food. Pancakes, eggs and ham steak are delicious. The home fries are fantastic!  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This would be my most favorite place for breakfast in Southwest area.

I got Cali Omlette with hashbrown and chicken noodle soup.
Toasts are followed.

These are nothing to be desired.

Very soft and not salty, not excess of anything inside.  kind and prompt service is the highlight.
 
I think the owner came from Greece. The flavor shows the mix of both countries."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Not only was our breakfast delicious, but we loved how the owner was so involved. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Place wasn't very impressing.  It's in a corner plaza next to a med spa and play area for kids.  The food was ok.  Service was good but there wasn't any \"wow\" factor in this place.  The prices range from $8-$14 and the food was that of Denny's.  I don't think I will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Seriously folks, this is a 3 star establishment.  Nothing wrong with 3 stars, I eat at them all the time, usually prefer them over the 5 stars, because the 5 stars are usually miss-labeled by Yelpers that do not understand the system.  Is this the best breakfast you have ever, in your whole life, eaten?
     This is the second time we have been at Mr. Mamas - the first was at the old location and now at the new.  Don't remember what I got last time, but this time was the ham & eggs with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Didn't care for the gravy, so they kindly took it off the check.  The eggs and ham were ok - the eggs and hash browns both needed seasoning.  My daughter got only the hash browns and dumped a ton of salsa on it.  Which reminds me, all the up selling is $1.95 - veggies, $1.95, salsa $1.95, etc., etc.  
     Portion sizes, prices and service all good.  It just isn't worthy of anything more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"In response to acquiring the fifth star, the following should be received as constructive advice IMO adding artwork on the walls, decorations, chairs and tables could be improved, the low ceiling and yellow walls remind me of a cafeteria instead of a restaurant, if the owner realizes that the restaurant always had a long waiting long during breakfast hours... Why not offer free, hot coffee to those who are waiting outside in the chilly cold weather."}
{"text":"This place has always been solid. The food is good ol home style breakfast .  Awesome quality and friendly fast service even when this place gets busy. I'd recommend a half order of biscuits and gravy and then a short stack of some quality pancakes. The chicken fried steak is awesome too if ya feel like some serious caloric splurging.  They offer lunch as well but I haven't got that far...serious can't get over the gravy. It's amazing. Thanks Mr Mama for being a solid establishment. :)"}
{"text":"1 of the best hidden gems in town. Friendly staff and always excellent service. Highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Had the blueberry French toast special and it was fabulous. $10.95 for a cup of coffee (with refills), 4 pieces of French toast with blueberry glaze and two eggs. Highly recommend this place! Great service and wonderful food."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast spot for my friends and I to try and I came across Mr. Mamas on yelp. I noticed they had great reviews on food and service so we decided to try this place. We arrive on Sunday in the afternoon and it was packed! Immediately I thought this was a good sign :) the hostess told us it would be a 45 min wait. I was in no hurry so I wasn't too worried about waiting. They were on point about wait times because after 45 mins we did get our table. As mentioned on other reviews, food and service was great! Just be aware that there may be some wait times.. it seems long but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here around lunch time for our anniversary breakfast while visiting from LA. As soon as we walked in I was blown away by the service from the staff. They make you feel like family here even though they don't know you. And that is a lost art in the customer service industry in los angeles. 

We both had breakfast plates that we devoured!

Great food. Great service. Clean restaurant. Great prices.

I wish there was a place like Mr.Mamas back home."}
{"text":"Read all the great reviews for breakfast so we decided to try it this trip. The owner greets you at the door and is very pleasant. I ordered the eggs Benedict with regular bacon (I'm not a fan of Canadian bacon) and it comes hash browns. The eggs came out over cooked and the owner walked over before I could even say anything and had them remake them. The serving is a regular size but I wasn't super full. My husband ordered the mamas short stack with scrambled eggs and sausage. I was still a little hungry so I ate some of his healthy serving of pancakes. We both had the iced coffee since it was the daily special and it was just the right combo of coffee and sweet. We even got some to go! Used the $15 for $30 yelp deal (which cannot be combined with the free drink FYI) and the total was under $23 so she got a great tip!"}
{"text":"When we walked in the door, we were greeted by a kind and happy man who I soon learned bus the co owner, along with his brother. We heard the story of how the  place got and kept its name. Our servers were prompt and efficient and didn't forget a thing. The food was good and perfect potions.  We enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great experience. I got French toast, best French toast I've ever had, they put extra cinnamon on top. Wait was about 30 min on a late Friday morning. Food came very fast"}
{"text":"Service was very good from walking in the door to leaving. The Greek omelet was the best I ever had. Live on east coast n this was the best."}
{"text":"Nick and his staff are the best. The food is awesome and the service is great. They get you in and out in no time, absolutely the best breakfast restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The perfect, classic breakfast spot. The owner was super friendly, awesome staff and solid dishes."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Breakfast spot in the middle of the industrial area in Vegas.
Is Worth the wait..food and service is GREAT...We WILL be back for sure with the family.."}
{"text":"Our first time to Mr. Mamas was excellent.  The cornbeef hash and baked ham were perfect,  the hash brown and eggs were fresh and as ordered.  The hostest was so friendly and has kept the place rolling like clockwork. From Seattle,  we definitely go back on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Incredible!  We enjoyed every bite and will be back while we are here in Vegas.  We got the Cali Omelette and Mammas Stack and split it between the four of us. The employees were super friendly and the food came out quick. Very very good!"}
{"text":"I loved the at-home, down to earth vibe of this restaurant. My boyfriend and I ate here while visiting Vegas on a very busy Saturday morning and while the wait to be seated took about 35 mins (totally understandable), the food and the service more than made up for it! Our waitress was so friendly and attentive and the kitchen prepared our meals within 10 minutes of us sitting down.

The biscuits and gravy were amazing! They make their gravy with bits of bacon, sausage and maple syrup.  It's fantastic! Definitely give it a try when you visit Mr. Mama's!"}
{"text":"The staff there is great. Like everyone I came here because of the reviews looking for some delicious food. But after I was done I thought to myself what was so special about that? Anyways, the best why to describe it is like your average breakfast place with a long wait and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever... fluffy yet chewy. Chicken fried steak was awesome. Friendly and very fast service. Definitely will visit again before heading back home."}
{"text":"I had to write a review. This is an awesome breakfast place, worth the drive off the strip. Fresh hot breakfast check delicious check great service check expensive naah... Save your money from the buffets and go here..will be back"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food hands down! 
Eggs Benedict is to die for.
Such a great and friendly staff as well, everyone makes you feel like family when you walk in!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and wasn't disappointed.  Came in famished, left satisfied.  Breakfast was delicious."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Vegas!!!! We have eaten at Blueberry Hill (good), Hash House A-GoGo (good) and Cracker Barrel (could be better), and Mr Mamas is by far the best. Food was delicious! The French toast is amazing! The Cali Omelette is delicious! The biscuits and gravy were so tasty!
The service was superb!!!! I have never had such great service at a restaurant, including the manager! I will definitely be going back every time I visit Las Vegas!!! Prices are very reasonable! Was pleasantly surprised when I saw our total. Food was just bomb.com!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food. Ordered a BLT and it was LOADED with bacon. They even put a fried egg in it for me! Atmosphere is a little cafeteria-y but other than that the service was impeccable - our server treated us like one of the family :)"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday around 9am. Table of 2, seated immediately. Our waitress was very attentive but considering the small dining area her attentiveness to us was a tad overwhelming. I had the veggie breakfast wrap, sub avocado for egg. It was quite yummy and filling. We got the $15 for $30 deal and ended up with a whole meal's worth to take home. The food was normal breakfast style, nothing phenomenal nor bad. The owner was walking around from table to table, getting personal with all of his customers... except for us. We were excited when we heard him say \"I'm Mr Mama\" and watched as he socialized through the dining area, but he skipped our table. I felt a bit unvalued."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Seriously, this is honestly the best service I've ever had at a small breakfast place like this. Everyone made us feel like we were with family and treated us like we'd been eating there for years. Their portions are huge! We ordered about the same we order at places like IHOP and had to take half of it to go. The quality of the food exceeded my expectations as well especially considering how cheap it was. If you're in Vegas and looking to eat some traditional breakfast, go straight here. Seriously, stop looking up other restaurants on yelp, come here."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.Our to go place for breakfast or lunch when in town. Good daily specials. Owner is really nice and his daughter Jenna is a darling. Wonderful staff. So get off the strip with all the hoopla about which chef restaurant you are going to eat at for a very pricey meal. Come on support your local family run business."}
{"text":"The customer service here is incredible, the food is amazing, and I have never had a more perfectly cooked over easy egg. We stopped in for breakfast, and we are so glad we did. There are a lot of servers, and the place was pretty busy, but they seated people with such efficiency, that it didn't feel busy at all. Definitely a new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it. Super super nice staff. Waitress gave us samples of things we wanted to try and was very patient and explained many of the dishes to us because we weren't familiar with this restaurant. We ordered a bunch of things! Pancakes were great, I like DuPars best, but these were a close second. French toast was fab, the gravy was soooo good, had plenty of sausage in it, biscuits were ok. The chili was really good and bacon was really tasty and huge! Will come again for sure, just wish they were open at 3am."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! we enjoyed the steak and eggs (their hash browns and home fries are on point) and the mamas French toast.
Service was good, people there are very attentive and kind, prices are super affordable, parking is not an issue... expect to wait at least 20min, they are busy but it's totally worth it"}
{"text":"Very friendly, great food, great service. Definitely worth the trip away from the strip."}
{"text":"This place is great! We live in Henderson and wanted to try some where new, and we are glad we did. I am all about customer service and they are super on top of it. Small 20 minute wait but sure worth it. I don't normally eat chicken fried steak but I had to try it because of so many others saying it was amazing. Well it lived up to the hype and surpassed my expectations. The first thing that came out was the cinnamon roll, it was tasty and hot, it seemed as though it was made fresh right that minute. I also tried the veggie omelette, and it was perfect also, with nice crispy hash-browns."}
{"text":"Great home style breakfast! Great staff! Being southern, I asked about their gravy & they immediately offered me a sample! That is respect & confidence in their product! Very impressed! The pancakes, potatoes, chicken fried steak, & coffee are amazing! We love Mr.Mamas."}
{"text":"Its a surprise to me as a local that this place is busy and people from all over come here. The food is great. I had the chicken fried steak..the gravy was delicious. The owner is the host and he really makes you feel welcome. We waited for a 20 mins to be seated and it was 11am.  This place is really close to where I live and Im glad i found another breakfast place because I love a good breakfast. We will come back to try their pancake and french toast which looks good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever!!!! Whenever I am in Vegas there are to certainties. One that I'll lose my money and Two that I will be at Mr. Mamas. This place is a nice little restaurant located a fair distance from the strip. The owner of this place treats every customer like gold. He is the nicest guy and always wants to make sure that everyone is having a great meal. The food is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the Chili Cheese Omelet. I know it sounds strange, but its delicious. Great home style food!!! Keep it up Mr. Mamas!!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location, great breakfast and exceptional service. I arrived on a Friday around 10AM and didn't have to wait long, maybe 10 mins. It did get pretty busy by the time I was leaving though. I had a huge greek omelette, super crispy hash browns and marble rye toast. I'll make sure I stop in again next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"You really can't beat this place for a quality breakfast in this part of town. The Cali omelet was fantastic. The pancakes are made light and fluffy. Even the toast was made right, with the right amount of butter. The service was outstanding, and so was the value. Just realize that this place is well known, and on the small side, so get there early if you don't want a long wait for a table."}
{"text":"This place is AH-mazing!!!!!! Right off the bat this place is amazing for the service itself! Very kind and attentive. Everyone was/is happy to be here and to help. 

I had the Mama's Sandwich and oh man! The bacon is so delish and the sandwich is piled HIGH! My friend got the French toast plate and it looked amazing! Soft and fluffy French toast!! I will definitely visit this place again next time and recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Talk about a 5 star establishment! Awesome staff, great food and perfect pricing. Shaun, the manager, is what a manger should be! Talk about great customer service! Wait staff is awesome and attentive even when its jammed packed. I had the Philly Cheese steak Sandwich. So delicious! And onion rings were super tasty. Thank you for making us feel at home."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place thanks to yelp. To begin with the people here are so nice. I am really big on customer service and how i feel about spending my money. Everyone here provides the same service and they are so accommodating and nice. I had the California omelette and the pancakes. Both really good. This is definitely a good breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Friendly welcoming service, perfectly cooked breakfast, spotless interior - yummy, clean and friendly - with vintage photosfrom their family businesses on Rt 66. Totally recommend. Only things that could improve is real maple syrup and real butter but who has that anymore, any way."}
{"text":"We Sandiegans look forward to our visit to Mr. Mamas every time. You are greeted and treated with a smile and respect and the good is great! Thank you for making m feel like family!!!!!"}
{"text":"We're from LOS ANGELES.. every time we're in Vegas this is our breakfast spot. Won't go anywhere but here. I think that say's it all."}
{"text":"About 15 minutes away from the strip, Mr. Mamas did not disappoint! My family and I were looking for something that wasn't located in a casino and not a buffet. After reading a few Yelp reviews, we decided to venture out. After less than 5 minutes, we were seated and ready to order! The owner was friendly, personable and charming! His personality made for a great experience! Biscuits and gravy, two over easy eggs and a cup of joe = $12! Win! Win!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are fluffy.  Oatmeal is prepared well. Omelets are amazing!



I can see why this place is five stars.  The food is excellent, the service is exemplary and the staff is patient, courteous and welcoming. I am so full.  I had to write this because finding a great place to eat in Vegas is hard to find.  Go.to.this.place. You will love it too."}
{"text":"I ordered:
Food: Denver Omelette: got it w crispy has browns and chocolate pancake (plate sized). It was delicious!!! I had half of my omelette and half of pancake left over. I love breakfast foods!

$: super affordable and huge portions

Ambience: casual, feels like I'm at a friends place or relatives place 

Staff: Super super super friendly and helpful!  You can tell they have a good work environment and great rapport with their customers and each other! 

Next time I come back, I will be ordering the eggs Benedict and time after that I will get house hash, and then after that I will get the biscuits and gravy (they offer if you want to sample the gravy). 

Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"We came in again today, they said the  wait was close to 30 we got seated sooner. It was worth the wait. 

Today we ordered the mamas stack, chicken fried steak and build your own omelette. 

The staff is friendly and quick. The food was cooked just the way we ordered it. 

The portions are big and although it's super busy I never felt rushed to leave. The owner is super nice and goes around the tables to ask people about their food and their experience. 

Jazmin our server was very attentive and I would definitely come eat here again."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!! Great service, they make you feel so welcomed and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Talk about another solid breakfast/lunch spot in Vegas. Most of all another great option on the west side of town. Apparently Mr Mamas moved from there old location but thankfully just up the road so still on my side of town! I have came twice and both times the experience was awesome. My first time came with another yelper Suzy H for no shocker another recovery meal from tri training. Talk about packed for lunch. Really both my visits lunch cross your fingers get seat. If you do get seat count on great experience from customer service, great food, and an owner that not often see HANDS on guy. He literally constantly walking around too every table making sure everything on point. Not just checking on customers. I felt like knowing that not chain believe just family run restaurant. The owner comes off very very genuine, totally asking for feedback, friendly, and sense that treats every customer like your part of his family. One of the first things notice about the dining room feels more like this big open family dining room. Not many booths just all old school tables and chairs. They do have some television around the room. Really not much going on with interior design. 

My first trip order the breakfast burrito. I enjoy the size of it. It not small and it packed with all the good things in life. Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Cheese, and few more things. The salsa that comes with it. If I could would get bowl of that with chips and be in chips/salsa bliss. The second trip ordered the chili cheese omelette. Again size is not problem when you come to Mr Mama. All the food they serve is generous portion size. The chili something that Mr Mamas is famous for or least on the menu that the impression I got. It was good. Truth had better. The combination of the chili, cheese, and stuff in the omelette worked awesome for me! The fried potatoes believe they called it. Ah nothing special. The omelette worked more for me then the potatoes..

They do offer free drink with your yelp checkin. 

Overall definitely fan of Mr Mamas. See myself coming back more often try more of the menu..."}
{"text":"Amazing service from the moment you walk in the door. Food is amazing and the portions are huge! Make the drive from the strip and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Super friendly staff and the food is great !!! 
The chicken fried steak was bomb!"}
{"text":"Amazing Country Fried Steak!!! Gravy was pretty good too.  Home fried potatoes, Bacon, Hashbrown... everything was just bomb!  I do like the biscuit and gravy from Molly Brown's in Victorville area better...where I usually go for breakfast but hands down I like their country fried steak better so I'll be back here instead.  I'm assuming the owner was in the front who helped us was cool along with staff."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, 45 minute wait. Hate to admit but with the price and long wait it wasn't worth it. Where the high rating for this place comes from is beyond me. I have to wonder if reviewers have the right place.

I had 2 eggs and ham, hash browns and toast. Wifey had the chili. We both had coffee. My eggs were cooked well. The hash browns were crispy on the outside (nice) but mushy and overcooked on the inside (yuk). Toast is, well, toast; nothing special. The ham was what you would expect, a canned ham warmed on the grill.

My wife's chili was just okay. She thought it tasted a bit like canned ingredients.

Coffee was okay. Reminded both of us of McD's.

The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special at all. Very minimal effort went into creating this space. I was expecting much better.

Service was quick and friendly, but no where near the level you read in most of the reviews.

A side note: the to wonderful patron who brought their \"emotional support poodle\" with pink hair: really? Everyone knows."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Fast friendly service coffee cup or water glass never gets close to empty .  Had omelette & it was great .  Came with home frys with peppers & onions"}
{"text":"We were a party of 7: everything we ate was 5/5. Service was very attentive, staff were attending our table even if they were not our designated waitress. Quality, quantity and service were excellent. There was a wait and a line because it was sat morning, but we knew it was going to be fun."}
{"text":"The first thing I can say is they made me feel welcome. The food was very good and reasonably priced. The staff was friendly and helpful I would recommend this restaurant if you are in Las Vegas.  We were visiting from Kansas City, Missouri and we will come back here to eat."}
{"text":"Jena the manager she's amazing the staff is very friendly! The food is fresh and really good ... Great experience"}
{"text":"Fabulous home cooked breakfast.  Super busy with a wait...but it's worth the wait.  They are very efficient getting people served and tables cleared right away.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC and same everything in their new location.  YUM!  Just GO!"}
{"text":"Yup, Mr. Mama's hasnal these reviews for a reason. And they live up to the hype. Ita a great beakfast place. Not only is the staff very friendly, but the food prep is excellent. They will accommodate for whatever you want."}
{"text":"Warning,  this is not going to be a \"best place ever\" review.  I saw Mr Mamas on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Easy location and parking always a plus.  Food was good but not the \"best I have ever eaten\".  The thing that turned us off and we won't be back is the grilling it felt like we got from the wait person and apparently the owner.  Before our order was taken the waitress wanted to know if we had been there before, how we found out about them, had we been to the previous location.  When I mentioned we learned about them from Yelp she went on to say they were previously the # 1 breakfast in Vegas but since they moved they had to start over and build up their Yelp account.  Food was fast and good.  Now here comes the owner I guess making the rounds asking the same questions and telling every table they used to be  the # 1 breakfast in Vegas and 3 in the country or something (by now I was shutting it off) but now they have to start over.  You know 1st of all the meal was good, not the best I've ever eaten and I don't need to feel like my meal is dependent upon writing a review for various sites.  LIke 'em , love 'em if you will I won't be back."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place based on it's Yelp reputation and we are so glad we did! This is a short trip from the strip and the whole experience we had was impressive and satisfying. 

We got there early and Mr Mama himself opened the door for us and greeted us! The serving staff was quick and attentive, everything about the restaurant was extremely clean. The food was very tasty and affordable. I had the standard two egg breakfast and it was cooked perfectly. The cinnamon rolls are AWESOME: giant, soft, tasty.

If I was a local, I'd go there every weekend. Go to Mr Mamas!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome pancakes, big, really big servings. The people and service is also great. Definitely another must see in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food. Really like the owner of his friendly service. Good staff. We had brunch there."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch on Saturday and only had to Wait a short while but the host was so friendly and welcoming. I had the Marty wrap such was great and exactly what I wanted and expected, the Bf had the chicken fried steak and hash browns. Tons of food and it was all great! We even got our coffees to go! So great!"}
{"text":"Friday brunch date with the fambam from out of town. There was a 30 min wait. You can tell there's a lot of ppl from out of town so you know this place must be good. All the staff were very friendly and engaging. Welcoming environment with big smiles from the staff. The food portions were big! I love to eat, but I was only able to eat half and took the rest togo. Highly recommend,  would come back again. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow! Extremely attentive service and the breakfast burrito I had was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Long wait on a Sunday, but soooo worth the wait! Food was delicious and extremely filling... we had the chicken fried steak (yummy), mushroom omelette (yummy), breakfast burrito (yummy), and pancakes (didn't like them much, you could taste the flour).... the customer service was beyond awesome! Will definitely be back whenever we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mamma's food is so good. Our server Tamara was so helpful & such a sweat heart. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This place was a little out of our way.  But it was worth it.  Good food, fast service and good prices.  I love to find places like this to try when traveling.  Glad we did."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove into Las Vegas and found this little spot for some breakfast... Amazing!!! If you're in town you must stop by for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and literally got seats a few seconds after we got there. For it being on the busy side they were able to get us seated fast and not too long after we put our order in, our food came out. 

We both ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it comes with potatoes, eggs and your choice of toast. Out of all the breakfast places I've been to this had to be the best Chicken Fried Steak I've had yet and I love how the hash browns were seasoned. Both of us were completely satisfied with our meals, leaving with full and happy tummies. Only thing I wished was that they had more options on their menu but what we tried was executed perfectly.

The customer service is on point here, everyone is so nice and the environment is so welcoming. I love the staff here. We even got asked if we wanted our picture taken. Just an overall really good experience."}
{"text":"this place is by far the best breakfast place in Vegas. If you're here on vacation or just a party on the strip. This is well worth an Uber or taxi ride to come and try. I could not tell you what was better the service or the food. Everything here is five star from when you first walk in too when you get seated so when you're eating your food all the way till when it's time to pay....

This last time I went which was earlier today. I ordered my food to go. While sitting in the waiting area I was observing how the greeter was. Before you even walk in they are already getting you a table set (if it's not busy) the interact with every customer that comes into that restaurant. I couldn't even call it a customer it make you feel more like a guess or family. Best breakfast brunch spot in Vegas bar none!"}
{"text":"One of the few times having breakfast in Vegas. Nice local spot to get away from the touristy stuff. Big portions, good cinnamon roll, and nice people."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had the Deuces Wild (two pancakes and two eggs). So perfect! We also met Mr. Mama, himself. What a delightful man. I told him he reminded me of the Ghost of Christmas Present for A Christmas Carol. \"COME IN!! And know me better, man!\" He treats this place like an extension of his own home. The staff was a delight as well. Top notch place that I hope everyone visits while in Vegas. We have an 8 hr drive ahead of us. They sent us on our way with a to-go coffee and smiles, putting us in the perfect mood."}
{"text":"They have the best service. Everyone makes sure your coffee cup is filled and the best food."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was exceptional. Ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits, very delicious. Biscuits light and fluffy and sausage gravy was great. Hash browns was crispy and yummy. Fresh OJ was nice complement. Would definitely come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we always look forward to coming here for breakfast. Just a short drive off the strip and it's way cheaper than a buffet at any of the hotels, not to mention better. The food exceeds expectations each visit and the service is outstanding. Each employee goes above and beyond to give great customer service to every customer. I wish we had something as amazing as Mr. Mamas back in Orange County."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner and workers. The food was good. I was not a fan of the gravy. Our waitress said it has syrup in it. It didn't not have enough seasoning. Other than that everything was great. They have great customer service, I would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and even better customer service! All of the waiters/waitresses were so attentive. The food came quick and was the best breakfast I have had in a long time! I wish we had a Mr. Mamas back home. This will definitely be  where we will have breakfast anytime we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast here... Late/mid-morning breakfast on a weekday... The place was busy, but they have plenty of tables.. Very clean. 

Good prices too. Very fair and affordable. 

Service here is GREAT. Everyone here is sooooo attentive and friendly. 

The food here is like your usual American diner food.

Hubby ordered French toast.. Came with 3 eggs and bacon... The French toast was light and fluffy. Looks like a lot, but easily killed... Egg is standard... I was surprised by the bacon though... Thick cut, nice and crispy... But had no flavor! No saltiness or anything. That was a first! 

I ordered the chicken fried steak. And it was delicious! My meal came with a biscuit.. Everything was so heavy and dense, I skipped the biscuit (nice and buttered) and hash browns and just focused on the chicken fried steak and eggs. Again the eggs (over medium) is standard, with yummy runny yolk.. But the chicken fried steak was crunchy and flavorful.. Probably didn't even need any gravy! Yum! A generous portion too. I asked for the hash browns to be extra crispy. It was on the outside.. But the inside was a bit mushy... 

Overall, an awesome place to go for a nice classic American breakfast with the BEST service.. Friendliness goes a long way.."}
{"text":"Mr mamas is a great breakfast spot ! Great service and great food! Everything taste very good and the customer service is beyond good!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas has the highest rating for a reason--great customer service, fast seating, attention to detail, and delicious food! We came in because of the ratings and we're not disappointed. Their food is fresh--no frozen hash browns--their orange juice squeezed, and everything delicious!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving we were welcomed by a man who appeared to be the owner. Very friendly, welcomed us in and we were seated in a very short amount of time! The waitresses were all very friendly! Service was quick and delicious ... I had the eggs Benedict and my husband the breakfast burrito ... We were both very satisfied .... Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We left the hotel to go to a local place simply because we were tired of buffet food and wanted a pipping hot breakfast. We came to this place based on the reviews. We did not have to wait for a table, but we did have to wait for our food for what felt like an eternity. Was the wait worth it? NO! The food was cold when it arrived AND we noticed a table that came AFTER us get their food first. On top of all that, the check was put on the table when we started eating; what if we wanted to order something else! Take your money elsewhere. I have had better pancakes and eggs."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Visiting Las Vegas right now and yelped this place. 

The corn beef hash I got was stunning. I've had many variants of this through the years, but this was by far the best tasting variation. It comes slab like with a perfect egg on top, along with extra crispy hashbrowns. The corn beef was a perfect balance of meat mix and crispness, the hash brown was flavorful and so was the toast."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place every time that we are in Vegas. The food, service and price is always awesome! The owner is very nice. This place is a must!! Awesome spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about? The hash browns were soggy (on the inside), pancakes were also soggy, and very little portions. Try \"The Egg & I\", large portions and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Abundant portions. 
Good customer service. 
fantastic food. 
Cat was phenomenal....& great coffee! 
we heard about the delicious cinnamon rolls but unfortunately after our meal we were pretty stuffed so we will have to return to try them next time...but we will definitely be returning!
two thumbs up to this little gem, thank you yelp for finding this bfast joint for us."}
{"text":"The reviews are very accurate when they say the food and service are both excellent. Pancakes are huge, bacon and grits are delicious. Cat the manager is very nice as well as the entire staff. They couldn't be more helpful.  Tables are spread apart giving adequate room so I can understand why there is often a long wait. Well worth it if you have the time."}
{"text":"A traditional American brunch dining place. It gets lots of stuff in one combo/plate. You can not complain about the food with the 10 dollar price range."}
{"text":"Awesome place, the owner is a really genuine, down to earth guy. We will be back, if not for the food, but for the service. However, the food was amazing too. Great, well portioned breakfast and the biscuits and gravy was the best my husband said he has ever had in his life and he's something of a biscuits and gravy connoisseur lol. Give this place a try, you won't regret it for a moment."}
{"text":"Amazing service... everyone ( I counted 16 employees) were super busy, friendly, and seemed to work well as a team. The food was eh... it wasn't bad, but not amazing in any way..."}
{"text":"Yummy turkey bacon and hash browns. Nothing fancy, just good breakfast food.  Service was good and my coffee cup got refilled often.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in with my daughter since we skipped breakfast. Surprisingly it was packed when we walked in and the hostess said it would be a 15 min. but we ended up waiting for less than 10 min. The hostess/manager was friendly and seated us by the window. We were curious as to the reason why it's named Mr. Mammas and she told us that previously it was a Greek restaurant, owned by a Greek owner who named the restaurant after a Greek Saint (hence the fact that the name is spelled w/o an apostrophe ['s]). Since the current owner is also Greek, he decided to keep the same name and create a logo that plays on the name (chef in a dress).  

Our server, Jose, then came promptly and took our drink order. He was a good server, kept refilling our drinks, and even asked if we wanted any drinks to-go. We ordered the Reuben Sandwich with a side of chili--this is one of the best Reubens I've ever had, lots of corned beef and tons of flavor! The chili was pretty tasty too :P We also got the French Toast plate topped with fresh strawberries & whipped topping which was quite delightful! We usually share our entrées so we split them in half so we can have a taste of each. The portions are pretty decent and you usually get leftovers for a nice snack for later in the day! I've been here a couple of times before and the quality is always up to par. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service or amazing food?  What brings people back and inspires diners to share a restaurant tip with friends and complete strangers?

It's the service.  Sure, the food has to be good, but it's the hospitality that will bring people back time and again.

Mr. Momas is amazing.  The attention to detail emanates from the owner to the staff and, ultimately, to the dining experience.  We felt welcomed from the moment we entered until the moment we left.  

With that said, I am happy we will be in town  for a couple of more days so we can go back!!"}
{"text":"First time here and all I can say is that this is the best customer service I've ever received at a restaurant. The food is good, service was super fast and they make you feel valued as a customer. Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Perfect diner breakfast! Wonderful French toast, biscuits and gravy, good quality bacon and perfect hash browns!"}
{"text":"This place has exceptional service. I got the western bacon cheeseburger and it was fantastic. Definitely get ranch with your fries. Best ranch I've had at a restaurant in a while. Great prices, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Didn't believe the 5 star rating could be true so, came to see for myself. 

From the moment we walked in we were welcomed warmly by the owner, who takes his time with each guest, and the service from Melissa was attentive and patient. 

Food was tasty and generously portioned too. 

My dad, who doesn't say such things, said to himself \"Best breakfast ever.\" We all nodded in agreement."}
{"text":"Food here is average, I had the biscuits and gravy with side of bacon. For the price, they kinda skimp on the gravy but it tasted good. The service here is excellent which is why I give it 4 stars but food was average 3 stars, not bad but not great. My biggest complaint is they have basically no where to sit when waiting for a table. You have to stand outside in the sun given the direction the restaurant faces. Some kind of seating outside would make it much more tolerable when waiting 30+ minutes. Most of the time if it's over 30 minutes we just go elsewhere. It's also a bit warm inside but they usually have lots of fans running which makes it more tolerable"}
{"text":"First time customer. We went here for brunch and it was busy out the door. I knew that was a good sign.  We were greeted by the owner at the door and the staff were busy working but not too busy to ask how everything thing was going and were also taking photos for their guests. Very casual and friendly. The FOOD was EXCELLENT! I ordered the Greek omelette, a bowl of chili, poached eggs, and Mama's French toast. Food was simple and tasted fresh. You can tell from the ambiance that it is an enjoyable family friendly experience. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Mister Mamas is a great local breakfast and lunch restaurant. Easy to find and plenty of parking. Always nice to support the small local business."}
{"text":"Mr Mama himself was great and very charming! Spoke to everyone really felt like a guest in his home. We had to wait about 30 minutes on a Wednesday morning but it was worth it. Much better food that we would have got on the strip. Wait staff was extremely pleasant and very attentive. Everyone in my party had a great breakfast! Thanks Mr. Mama"}
{"text":"Super service, great food. that's a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Even though i was told this place was just ok i had to try it because I know Mr. Mamas is highly rated on yelp. 


Service - 3  stars 
As soon as we arrived we saw their was a wait. My initial thought was we might as well wait by the time we drive somewhere else and wait it will be the same amount of time. 
Upon walking in we were not greeted however we were Aggressively asked if we wanted our name on the list, a little taken back we said yes and she said \"I don't want to tell you a time , maybe 30 minutes , it's 12:05\" we noticed right after , the unfriendly ness of the host and almost considered just leaving but we went with the flow and took in the experience. 
Secondly the other Host who was obnoxiously calling names of guests across the parking lot like a mad man  sure scared  my friends along with the father and young son that were waiting a couple stores down. Not to mention he came out and asked us our name and then laughed after he said \"oh you guys are at the bottom haha sorry.\" 
Probably not the best thing to say to people patiently waiting outside of your establishment. 
Thirdly the other gentleman who was dropping food off to tables .....not our waitress (who by the way was very nice and attentive)  
There is no need to shout out what we ordered and aggressively drop the plate on our table. Manners and being kind and polite can truly go a long way . At this point we did not care what the food was going to taste like. The people I was with truly felt intimidated. I hope the reason behind all of the aggressiveness perhaps could have been due to how busy they might have been. 

3 1/2 Stars 
Food Quality 
I ordered the biscuits and gravy which I enjoyed. 
No complaints. If you need a little kick for your biscuits and gravy you might want to add some pepper or Cholula the sausage in the gravy isn't on the spicy side which was good for me. My eggs were cooked just right. 

The veggie omelette we ordered was very watery if you order it I would recommended ordering it well done! 

I'm sorry we didn't enjoy the vibe and the food was just ok , i was really excited after all the pictures on yelp ! 
this place may Be for some folks but it just didn't do it for  us. I probably won't be back if I do it will be with the dudes !"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that the staff here was wonderful. Seriously, every person was great. They engaged us in conversation, talked to my son and were prompt and efficient. My review is not based on my experience, but more so, the quality of the food. 

My boyfriend and I figured it out. We come from a place with the most amazing breakfast restaurant. We used to go there every Sunday. Then we moved. And we have never found another place like it. But if you live here, this probably IS the good breakfast spot. 

Anyway, I digress. My complaint is the food was not good. The has Browns were crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside- clearly cooked frozen. Boyfriend's omelet had very little of the things he asked for and an excess amount of spinach. The pancakes were actually ok but they were very bready. 

I just wish we could find a good place."}
{"text":"Ok, I was told about this place by a friend so I had to try it. It was GREAT.  From service to the FRESH food ... Good.  This is a MIST try when you come to Vegas.  The owner was very nice. He came over to the table to see how we enjoyed the service and food, nice touch.  This was an all around nice visit."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time...can't say enough good things...it was very busy but our table was ready in 10 min, we barely sat down when they came and told us about specials they brought our drinks and a cinnamon roll (homemade) Amazing! Our food literally took 7 min and all the staff was so pleasant made sure our drinks were full...best service EVER!!!!! Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"Excellent food, staff and price. Completely remote we had to take a cab as my son found this place online but worth it. Everything is so overrated on the strip.
We will be back in Vegas after our road trip through the canyons and will have breakfast there again before heading to the airport
Keep the good work!"}
{"text":"Tried Mr. Mamas while my wife and I were in Las Vegas on vacation.  The first thing that stood out to me about this establishment was that the owner was at the door greeting guests as they walked in.  The owner also asked if you enjoyed your food, and wanted sincere feedback.  Even though the waiting area and the restaurant was small, he made sure everyone was accommodated quickly.  The owner kept in contact with all guests and communicated to them how long it would be before their table was ready.  Without a doubt, the food was great - My wife is extremely picky and had only good things to say about the food, service and the restaurant.  All of the servers were great and very courteous as well.  Make sure you visit for breakfast when in Vegas or if you are a local and don't know about it, you must try it!"}
{"text":"Where to start. Our Lyft driver actually recommended this place. We were heading somewhere on the strip for breakfast. He told us it wasn't that great and then recommended Mr. Mamas. Said he's taken a number of people there in the last few weeks. Anyway, we arrive at this mysterious location. They open the door for us and welcome us in. The service is outstanding. The staff is attentive and helpful. We had the eggs Benedict and the Mamas short stack. Both were delicious. There was even someone walking around offering to take our picture. Super friendly, delicious food, and affordable! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The Rave about This Place Was Correct!! We came as a group of 8 and sat down within 5-7 mins of waiting. The staff is unbelievable friendly! They were very welcoming and the owner took the time to say hello and offer his services! Claudia took our drink orders and informed us of the various juices they carried. Several of the other staff came by our table to say hello as well and asked us where we were from. 
Claudia took our food order very nicely and accommodated any of the plates to our liking. I got the Cali Omelette, which consisted of, Cheddar Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Avocado and Sour Cream. I ordered the hash browns instead of the potatoes as well with wheat toast ! Omg! This was so delicious, when cutting the omelette you could see the cheese was melted just right! The avocado was very fresh and the sausage was seasoned to perfection!!! The hash browns were cooked to a golden brown, although I like my hash browns extra crispy, these were delicious!! This entree just went perfectly with the fresh orange juice they carry!! Thank you Mr. Mamas for I have found a new Breakfast place in LV!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to see what the fuss is about and was let down. pretty basic food. Place was a little dingy too"}
{"text":"The more I come to Vegas, the more I realize the best places are off the strip.  This little gem has awesome food, hearty portions and big on welcoming atmosphere.

Came here with my hubs and boys for breakfast before heading back home.  The boys split a small stack with eggs and ham.  The pancakes are HUGE, ham steak very tasty (8 yo ate the whole thing minus my taste) and eggs enough for my 6 and 8 yo.  The hubs had the four egg omelet with cheese and ham.  Big and filling.  I had the French Toast, eggs and bacon.  The French Toast was really good topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar.  Over easy eggs cooked perfect and delicious, crispy bacon.  The drinks were constantly topped off.  I saw their chicken fried steak and had already decided that would be at my table our next stop here.

I must say, the staff here is amazing.  Our server, Kathy, was very sweet and attentive.  They have their business down pat with an abundance of employees hustling to get the food out quick and hot.  Plates removed promptly and everyone very friendly.  The gentleman taking names at the front appeared to be Mr. Mama himself.  LOL Very nice and friendly to all.  Thank you for a delicious breakfast to end our fun stay in Sin City.  We will definitely see you again!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast the other day. This place is definitely a locals hotspot for breakfast. 

As you walk in, the staff greet you and are all very friendly. The waitresses and waiters are all very attentive even on a busy morning like that one. This place definitely has that diner feel. I'm not in love with the setup, just a bunch of low sitting tables all spread out. No booths or dividing walls. 

Food:

I ordered an egg white omelette with added chicken, avocado, and spinach with side of fruit. Omelette cooked perfectly. Great taste.

I also ordered a short stack of pancakes as well. The pancakes were fluffy and great taste. I have a big sweet tooth for breakfast - I didn't see much for options with their pancakes or French toast. 

If this place had more sweet options, I would have given it a five.
I should have ordered the cinnamon roll...
Next time I come in I will. 

Overall a great experience. I can see why locals come here for breakfast."}
{"text":"I really hate giving this place such a low rating but man, they're just not consistent on the food. The owner is real friendly and the staff is OK....
When we first started coming here the place was exceptional! We loved it for breakfast! Then it just started seeming very inconsistent. 
They would offer peppers with your potatoes and then they started up charging if you wanted it. Understandable.
The steaks tho! Omg. The first few times we went they were nice and juicy and tasted fresh. Now.....they're tough and very poor quality. I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, it has a weird taste and texture to it. Last few times our steaks were overcooked, poor quality and horrible. Eggs were also undercooked and toast wasn't even toasted. 
It's unfortunate because we loved this place. Now I don't even go there."}
{"text":"Nice people. Establishment is very basic. Food is ok. I ate here a couple years ago when visiting Vegas and didn't think it was worth a repeat visit. I accidentally returned this year because they moved locations and i couldn't remember the name and sadly i feel exactly as I did then. So I'm writing this review to remind myself I've already been here."}
{"text":"I just love this place! The staff is super sweet and very attentive. I tried their famous Marty wrap for my first visit and it was great. They certainly don't skimp on the bacon and avocado! that drives me crazy when restaurants skimp on bacon or avocado that they charge at least $1.00 or more. Fruit bowl was fresh, colorful and full of variety... The iced tea was very good too. I definitely see this becoming my regular breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Omelette was tasty, but the avocado was brown and old, and they got my order wrong. Thanks."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast here based on the Yelp reviews and it being close to our location.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Owner was greeting guests and explaining menu items,  the place was clean and all of the staff very friendly.  I had the country fried steak with their signature grave and it was delicious!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was delighted to hear this place expanded and to hear that it was a little closer to me. This is one of the few breakfast joints in Vegas that has excellent service, consistent efficient service, and perfectly cooked omelette, hash browns, French toast, and fluffy pancakes. 

There hasn't been a wait the two times I've been to this location. I love the warm, genuine welcome from the owner. Props to one of the few mom and pop restaurants who appreciate their customers. So many restaurants lack in this simple gesture but Mr. Mama and his staff set the standard of how you should treat your customers!"}
{"text":"Great friendly spot....they offer samples to assure you get what u want.....theor pancakes are awesome monster plate size....real busy...clean resteraunt...you cant see it from the outside its hidden but once you walk in youre greeted by their management and are seated immediately...you cant go wrong...."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday late morning (11 am) with a Meetup group. As we were waiting for our party to arrive I noticed that the place was very very busy. The staff accommodated our group with no issues.
The staff is as friendly as it gets and there are a lot of them. The owner was present and kept making the rounds amongst all the tables. This was so nice to see and it really made me feel like they actually care about what they do.
The food was excellent. I had the steak (medium) and eggs (scrambled). Perfectly cooked. The hash browns were crispy and flavorful. Other members in our party had no complaints and we all agreed that this was a must come again place. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Service and food were wonderful. The helpings were large and  not to expensive. We had the pancakes, French toast, eggs, sausage, bacon and home fries, all this for only $36. Everything was delicious. Pancakes were huge. You only need one. We will definitely come back and tell our family about this place. A most visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I would not go to this establishment.  Host was very rude.  We had a large group of 15, tells my Aunt that it will be a 30 minute wait, which we were fine with.  Sets up a couple of tables for us then gives it to another party that came in after us.  Then makes a comment \"dont worry- you'll eat today\"  so rude!!!  I have eaten there before, my family has not.  But we do a Friday breakfast every week!  Cracked Egg on Rainbow accommodates us, and so does Original Pancake house on Flamingo and Ft. Apache.  And appreciates our business.  I didn't want my Aunt and Uncle to spend their money at a restaurant that treats their customers so terribly before we even sit down at a table.  We were looking to change it up a bit and try somewhere else.  But Mr. Mamas will never be on the regular weekly breakfast list- ever!!  Funny thing is, my family has never been there, quite sad for Mr Mamas, potential new regular customers- gone!"}
{"text":"Our new breakfast go-to must stop spot. Awesome and attentive staff, they move the tables quickly without making you feel rushed. THE CORNED BEEF IS THE BEST! I purposely try other things to change things up and I've never been disappointed. Get there before church gets out or prepare to wait. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"There is NOWAY IT IS A FIVE STAR PLACE!!!!! Owner is rude and very aggressive if you don't say that you love his food, which is average good. He acts like a bouncer in a strip club, maybe that is where he should be and let his staff do their job."}
{"text":"Delicious! First timer today and the owner was a sweetheart. Seems like they're really good to their employees which is a plus to me! Food was delicious! I had the chicken friend steak and my friends had their benedicts. I have to go back and try their cinnamon roll; it looked so good from afar. Overall good experience and our drink never went empty. Also, I appreciated the server, I think her name is Jackie, asking if we needed a refill on drinks after we had already paid. Love that! I don't want to be a squatter but thanks for offering."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Best and fastest sit-down breakfast I have ever had at 2pm. Walked in an hour before closing and were seated immediately. I am gluten free so I ordered a Reuben sandwich with no bread, and on top of the side of hash browns that comes with it. our waitress Ro and the kitchen both made sure my special order came out perfectly. We barely had time to start drinking our coffee before all three of us at the table had our food. We stayed until closing and Ro made us feel welcome, saying don't worry about hurrying out. She even gave us tall to-go cups so we could take our coffee on the road. Would absolutely recommend for either morning or afternoon breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the food did not live up to the hype. The service was great!! But the breakfast definitely fell short of expectations based on previous reviews. I had the corned beef hash, it was gritty. and salty and shredded, unfortunately it only earned three bites. At least the scrambled eggs were good :-)
The cinnamon roll was fluffy but nothing more to gush about, very light on a very thin icing. I would not go out of your way to check out. Slightly sub par and deserving of only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Loved this place :) the staff and management were so incredibly inviting. Would definitely go again. Thanks for the great service !"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place for the first time today after hearing that it was great. So here's our take on it: family like atmosphere with very nice staff. There is a nice guy that comes around and ask if you want him to take a picture for you and he literally stood on a chair to get a good group pic for a family next to us. 
Food: husband orders the steak and eggs, he said his hash browns were mushy, steak was gummy and the food did not come out hot. 
I ordered the French toast, it was ok, did not come out hot either. The eggs were good and the bacon was very hard. 
I wish it would have tasted better. I will give them a second chance, it may have just been because they were busy."}
{"text":"I had to come check this place out after reading the reviews and they were right! The food tasted like some home cooking, the portions were huge and was reasonably priced. 

Big shout out to the host Shawn! My girlfriend left her phone at the table. he made sure to have it put to the side for us and waited for us to come get it even though they were closed"}
{"text":"Great local place. It's the type of place that you want to go to. No strip craziness. Super nice people. Food was large portion with great value. Will def go back. Food was delicious"}
{"text":"Truly outstanding.  The reviews say it all.  Had one of the best breakfasts ever at Mr. Mama's.  I don't remember truly loving the coffee, but I usually don't love the coffee at restaurants, so I'm not going to ding them for that.  Veggie omelette, home fries & the pancakes we shared were all fantastic.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast in Las Vegas on our way out into the desert, although I'm not sure it was an hour wait good.  The guy taking names and seating people was awesome, would come just for his entertainment.  My eggs benedict was tasty and the wife's enjoyed her veggie omelet.  She didn't care for the corn beef hash though.  Every place does it a little differently though and this variation just wasn't her thing."}
{"text":"The food I've tried here is amazing. Their portions are pretty big as well so you will likely be full or have leftovers to take home. The servers are kind and show great hospitality. The owner himself seems to always be here as well and greets customer. He makes sure everyone is having a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Worth the drive off the strip. Food was great and service at its best.  So good we went back the next day. Deffinately will be returning"}
{"text":"Awesome waitress. Amazing omelette best I have ever had it was so fluffy. Hash brown were good. Cinnamon roll not as good as I would like. Salsa good but they charge for it. Sour dough toast was not flavorful. Very clean nice atmosphere.  Owner says hi to u and they are nice to their staff it seems. We went early u can tell they probably get real busy like most good places to eat."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food and Service... My family and I were on vacation from Miami and Ohio. I read about Mr. Mamas on yelp and we were so happy that we went there for brunch to celebrate my brother-in-law birthday. Kat & Shawn service was so wonderful to us, they made us feel like we were family. Your hospitality coupled with the outstanding food just compliment our vacation. The amount of food you get is so filling with an affordable price. We are planning our next year vacation and we'll be returning back to \"Mr. Mamas\", food was better than the hotel food on the strip."}
{"text":"Outstanding example of doing it right!  Great service and great fresh made food that was brought out hot and timely.  Although their computer systems were down, and several people apologized for the inconvenience, service was still fast.  Mr. MAMA himself came over to apologize and thank us for being patient...   We will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. The prices are very reasonable. The food was amazing and so was the service. I wish we lived in the area. 

That corn beef sandwich with provolone cheese was sooooooo Ono (good)!!! The meat was so tender, it almost melted in our mouths. The French toast was cooked perfectly and the hash browns with cheese...I wish I would've ordered a double order they were cooked to perfection!

The owner Nick, greeted us at the door. He even stopped by the table to check on us frequently. He took time out of his busy day and sat down with us and gave us advice about opening our own business in the future.

Anytime I'm in Vegas, I'll make sure we stop here. The location was spacious and as soon as I walked in it was a very warm, friendly environment."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone in Vegas that doesn't want to eat at a typical breakfast chain restaurant! First time to Vegas and my boyfriend and I wanted a good meal before our drive to LA. We stayed on the strip but were tired of the limited (and expensive) options. Mr Mamas was great. The place was very busy and full of people but we waited about 10 minutes for a party of 2. The service was on point and the food was delicious. If I'm ever In Vegas I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"For starters, the staff is incredibly friendly! As soon as we walked in, the place seemed a bit busy, but they instantly greeted us, took our name down, and made us feel welcome! There were at least four parties ahead of us at the time, but they were all seated within 5 minutes which was great!

My boyfriend and I were immediately seated and our waitress offered us beverages. I ended up ordering the French Toast w/ Sausage and a side order of hash browns while he ordered the Chili and Cheese Omelette w/ a side of hash browns as well.

Now, my food was delicious! But before eating, my boyfriend had found a long hair in his omelette and a couple of small twigs in his hash browns. I get it, sometimes things like that happen (well I'm really not sure about the random twigs), but when your entire order has some issues, it's a bit of a nuisance and it's difficult to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"I love the service here!  How did the waitress know I wanted a cup of ice???  How did she know I wanted extra crispy hashbrowns???

The food isn't half bad either.  How can you say no to the maple bacon sausage gravy? =d

The new location is a lot bigger than their original location and the wait time is much shorter now =)"}
{"text":"Good parking, large comfy restaurant, nice menu choices, friendly employees, but really just an Ok breakfast. I was expecting more after reading the reviews, but to me there was nothing special about it. Coffee served in small mugs, which was Ok only so long as the refills came frequently, and for the most part they did. French toast OK (when I drenched it in syrup), and the bacon was good. Home fries a little disappointing, pretty much square french fries--I should have upgraded with the peppers and onions add-on. Mushroom omelet also OK, but the mushroom pieces were not as big and plentiful as we've seen elsewhere. Absolutely nothing wrong, but no reason for me to return (except maybe to try a hamburger)."}
{"text":"This place had really great costumer service and food. The people here are really nice and made me feel welcome. They have really great healthy alternatives. I asked to switch out my potatoes and for fruit and they did it no problem. And their fruit bowl was really fresh."}
{"text":"I'm here in Vegas for some meetings at a local casino. Since it's a longer trip, I brought my 81 year mother with me.  I'm a breakfast person and looked up Yelp for a highly rated breakfast place. Man did I hit the jackpot with Mr. Mamas! See what I did there... this is Vegas after all! Okay enough of my cheesiness... I take ratings seriously and even though I had to spend $50 in cabs, I wanted to check it out. 

First impression, I the taxi pulls up and Nik, the owner, opens the door and says,    
\"Welcome! We've been waiting for you!\" This guy is like a cousin that you actually want to see at family reunions. He was so sweet to my mom which I loved. Then our waitress was bilingual so that was an added bonus, bc my mom could speak to her more comfortably. But so far I haven't even mentioned how amaze balls the food was! I've include pictures of our incredibly flavorful omelettes. So generous with the avocado! But I gobbled up the french toast before I could take a picture. Did I mention I have a bit of an appetite? 

Anyway, the food was delectable and the service was completely delightful. Yelpers you didn't fail me. This place deserves the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. My wife And were greeted at the door by the owner. We ordered pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and a breakfast burrito. The food was good. Great menu with plenty of options. Plenty of parking, popular location but not overly crowded."}
{"text":"This place is great! My wife and I were looking for a place to eat off the strip and found this gem. The food is excellent and inexpensive. The service is fast, friendly and on point. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good breakfast/lunch restaurant.

We stopped in for Mother's Day brunch and there was a wait. It took less than the 30 minutes they quoted us to be seated. The server was very fast to greet us and take our drink order. The drinks came fast and the food order was taken then too. Once the order was placed, the food came out quickly. There was a small hiccup in the delivery of food. My wife asked for fruit instead of hash browns but the error was quickly fixed. The breakfast was delicious! Our waitress was able to refill drinks before they were empty and without being asked. It is very apparent that this place has great management and great employees to make this place run smooth."}
{"text":"Julie C and the hostess were wonderful. All the staff were friendly and welcoming. They really pay attention to their customers. I really wanted steak & eggs at a good price and that's what I received. Absolutely no complaints and we will definitely be coming back!! High recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I we're visiting from the Bay Area and wanted to try something off the beaten path. After searching on yelp for nearby breakfast joints, we found Mr. Mamas and boy are we glad we did! Everything about this place was wonderful from the moment you walk into the door (that they open for you) to when you leave (and yes they open the door you again on your way out. The prices were really cheap for what you get and the food was amazing! True home style cooking. I really appreciated that when my husband order the Mamas club (lunch sand which) the waitress suggested getting it grilled and explained the difference vs the toasted way its traditionally served. Everything was fresh, tasty, and just a cozy feel. 

This is definitely a place we will come back to again when we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast or brunch. I've been here twice. The first time I had the cornbeef hash, and the second time I had country fried steak. Both were delicious, portioning is big. They were very accommodating to big parties."}
{"text":"Came here with my father. I loved this place. Prices are reasonable. Service is quick, very polite, and responsive. They know what they're doing!

Most of all, the owner. That guy makes this restaurant what it is. I can honestly say that I have not been to a place before where an owner puts so much heart and effort to making guests, newcomers, whoever welcome. I'd come back just because of how great he was to myself and my father."}
{"text":"Good food, I had biscuits and gravy. I love when the biscuits are grilled.  Bobby had a Denver omelet and hash browns cooked nice and crispy like he likes them."}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's is a must visit breakfast place every time we are in Vegas and we come at least twice a month because of work. You really can't go wrong with this place & their new location is awesome. Staff is incredible. Food is great."}
{"text":"This place deserves a yelp review. OMG! its by far the best breakfast place i've had in vegas. been here in vegas for 3 years now and we always go to babystacks or hash house to eat out in the morning. as soon as you open the door, the staff are welcoming and very accomodating, plus, theyre funny and makes u feel at home. their chicken fried steak and eggs is just THE BOMB, the sauce is specially made by them and it blew me away when i first tasted it! french toast is so fluffy that i feel like im eating a marshmallow, bacon? super crispy and i always want it that way. ambience wise, very cozy and relaxing. PERFECT PLACE TO EAT BREAKFAST!  i give this place a 10 star, if i could #bombdotcom"}
{"text":"Overall I had the French toast eggs bacon and home fires potatoes and a half order of sausage biscuits and gravy.  Everything was excellent Even the potatoes were good but that was the only thing that was very salty maybe they just oversalted them that day but the potato Should come to the table without any salt .  Like I said everything else was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Mr.Mamma himself greeted us as we waited for our table. Super honey spot. Great A+ service. We were witted within minutes on an early Saturday morning. The whole spot seems to be enjoying their food."}
{"text":"I like it. Went there in my own on a Thursday morning and had Eggs Benedict. Delicious hash browns. Eggs done just right. Very attentive service. Mr Mama was there making sure everyone is happy, as he puts it \"treated right\". Simple recipe for success: an attentive owner that cares about his business. Other businesses can learn from this."}
{"text":"Talk about customer service! everyone we encountered here was so nice and helpful. It was so refreshing to have such great service. The food was so good! Large portions. I had the french toast and it was delicious! You need to try this place, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Very close to a 5 star rating. We went on a Sunday morning because of the one $ sign and good reviews on Yelp. It's in a strip mall right behind the Jesus is Lord church. It was kind of busy, but we went on a Sunday morning and the guy who checked us in said, \"its the Lord's day, that's why we're busy.\" That being said, it was only about a 15 minute wait. Classic diner feel down to the black and white checkered floor. The service from start to finish was excellent, very friendly, very nice. We ordered a variety of things and I was encouraged to get the chicken fried steak- which I just thought was good not great. Both my daughter and I ordered over medium eggs, neither one of which were over medium (If I wanted over easy I would have ordered over easy, but that's a tough call for many restaurants). Hash browns were very tasty and the pancakes were to die for! French toast was also good, sausage was good. As you can see we ate a ton of food. If you order the chicken fried steak you need to be starving because it's a BIG piece of meat. Overall, the experience was very nice and I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place is so good! We got Eggs Benedict (florentine for my \"meatless Monday\" & one with sliced turkey) both great! The house potatoes were so good! Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle! We also got the French toast and eggs for our little girls and they both enjoyed it! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Buying the $15 deal on yelp, I ended up with an awesome deal. For $27 I got 4 entree meals, 2 sides and a hot chocolate. Now thats not the end of it, yes the food was AMAZING. The service was AWESOME. Lastly, the owner is REAL cool. Bless him. Aha."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas this was a place recommended by the locals. Located off the strip but still in a decent part of town. It's in a shopping plaza so plenty of parking. We were seated right away but it can get busy. The host was very personable and made great small talk with those waiting to be seated. Service was excellent. Quick, attentive, polite. I could rave about the service alone. Food was standard diner food, good portion sizes to cost, and did I mention so quick! Loved that the side fruit wasn't just melon with pineapple, but all berries. They must actually do seasonal fruit. This place isn't for those with food allergies but as always I think you can navigate to not starve while you're there. Hope you're able to try it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Delicious omelettes and hash browns! Staff is friendly and professional. Will be back when we visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The food was great portions, and the prices were just right, Derrick & Shawn are the nicest! 
We will definitely be back! 10 stars not 5!!!!!
The pancakes & cinnamon roll was awesome! We felt welcomed and can't wait to be back in Vegas to visit Mr.Mamas again!!!"}
{"text":"Great little privately owned place! My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast based off of Yelp reviews (THANK YOU Yelp!) and we were very impressed. Very friendly staff from even before we came into the restaurant (hostess held door open for us and greeted us!) ...and its genuine, not forced. Mr Mama came to our table to greet us and welcome us to his restaurant which was pretty cool. The menu was a good selection of breakfast and lunch items. I ordered the veggie omelet w/ fruit on the side and my boyfriend ordered the chili filled omelet (sorry no pictures! we we're too hungry and dug in right away). The omelettes were delicious and tasted just like homemade. 
We came in between breakfast and lunch rush so we were seated right away (I may be wrong but there seemed to be about a dozen tables so). But if you come when its busy its definitely worth the wait. The place has some neat old photos on the wall so take the time to check those out. Table is fully stocked as well, it has all the things you might need i.e. salt and pepper, ketchup, tabasco, etc. Great family friendly vibe in there.... good energy all around. Recommend Mr. Mama's for sure!

***i was not coerced or bribed into giving this review"}
{"text":"Where do I began. The staff here is friendly and fast service, the owner is super nice and trying he's best to make you feel welcome. The food is very good, all very traditional American brunch nothing out of the ordinary but is well done and price is  very affordable. We will be coming back soon for more. They do not have a kids Menu but they will accommodate for your kids."}
{"text":"The veggie omelette was mind blowing with some avocado on the tops. Also the French toast and biscuits and gravy were good too!! Our server Denisse was just awesome. Impeccable service!!"}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it. The food was very good. I got the chicken fried steak with gravy. It was delicious. Hubs got corned beef hash. It wasn't too salty like others I have had. It was crunchy and tasty. Prices are reasonable for portions. Service is good too. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Service is great. Biscuits and gravy were delicious. French toast was tasty. The prices are very good. Breakfast burrito was not bad. Again, the service was great!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Mr. Mamas for the first time and we will be back!! Excellent food and Lourdes our server was great as well. Very friendly and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"The best food and service! The cost is very great. I love it. My 19 yr. old girl look for the restaurant and so the reviews great reviews. I am so glad to use technology to the best food and prices. Love it."}
{"text":"Really good spot for breakfast/lunch. Just had lunch with my family and we all liked it. Pretty busy but yet very fast service and good food."}
{"text":"Very good pancakes that are homemade. People are very nice as they greeted us . Very good place to eat"}
{"text":"Love their friendly staff. Fast service, great pancakes great eggs and most importantly CLEAN! It definitely beats iHop, Denny's and even some fancy expensive breakfast places."}
{"text":"Beyond outstanding service. Excellent food. Great prices. From the moment I walked in the door to the time I left I was welcomed like family or a long standing local. Friendly staff with great etiquette and attitude is frankly barely doing them justice but is the best way I could summarize them. The food too is excellent being made fresh and hot to order. I had the French toast with eggs and bacon: the French toast was quite good, the eggs perfectly over easy (as I ordered), and the bacon perfectly crispy and not greasy! Coffee was delicious and I highly recommend and the refills came before you even needed to ask. I will definitely be back again whenever I find myself back in Vegas! A locals gem indeed and well deserving of its stars and ratings."}
{"text":"Everything rated a 5.  All the revews were right on.  Denisse our server made the eating experience even more perfect.  Highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast and more..."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my first day in Vegas. The staff greeted us immediately and even held the door for me and my friend! We had a variety of breakfast foods and every single thing was delicious! It also came out in about 5 minutes after ordering. Keep in mind this was a week day, I'm sure it is busier on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was great & service was great! We were going through Vegas on a road trip and am glad we stopped here. It was nice that it was off the strip so it wasn't too busy/crazy, but you could tell this place still stays busy with locals and now I know why! We had an omelet , biscuits and gravy, French toast and pancakes and all 4 of us loved our meals. I was especially impressed by the hostess' and servers friendliness. They actually make you feel welcome and had great service."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about with this place. I suppose for the service. Let me start by saying the 25+ minute wait in the hot sun outside was definitely not worth it. I had the pancakes combo with eggs and bacon, plus sides of grits and hash browns, plus OJ and coffee. The best parts of the meal were the coffee and pancakes, the rest was very lackluster. I ordered less cooked bacon and received hard-as-a-rock bacon that was noticeably overcooked. The butter they gave me for the grits was fake butter (margarine made of vegetable oil). The eggs were ordered over medium but came out quite undercooked. The service was excellent, however. We received an enthusiastic fist-pump on the way out the door with a 'thanks brother for coming'. Not sure if others like this, but I found it to be an awkward way to thank someone for their patronage. Prices were decent. I hope others find this review helpful."}
{"text":"Usually don't eat breakfast, mostly coffee. Let's just say I barely drank my coffee. Excellent service. Food was A+"}
{"text":"This was probably the best breakfast I've ever had. Get the hash browns and biscuits and gravy. They are the real MVP. 

I got the corned beef hash and it was incredible."}
{"text":"This place has EXCELLENT service and food. Our family was visiting Las Vegas and looked for a place to grab brunch. I found Mr Mamas, and it looked like a decent place so we went.

I loved how as soon as we got to the restaurant, they made us smile. Before I even opened the door, a guy greeted us opening the door for us. Started us off on a great day. 

I ordered the French Toast(2) and a Cinnamon Roll. Others ordered the Veggie Omelet, Country Fried Steak w/ Eggs, and Steak and eggs.

The Cinnamon Roll came out first and it was gone in a jiffy. It tasted homemade, fresh, and OMG amazing. Loved it. The French Toast was also really good, tasted like quality French toast. Next the omelets. Well first of all they were HUGE and they tasted savory and fresh, just how omelets should be. 

Overall quality food and loved the quick service. Definitely recommend for people that love traditional American breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast ever best service my next trip back to Las Vegas breakfast will be here"}
{"text":"We went there after visiting red rock canyon. The owner greeted us at the door and was very friendly and helpful with getting our large table together. We ordered a single pancake for my three-year-old and they made it look like Mickey Mouse. The chicken fried steak with sausage gravy was very good. We also got a steak and eggs breakfast that was good. The eggs Benedict was great. Our server was very friendly and helpful. She recommended a ranch to visit for our kid and the service was extraordinary."}
{"text":"YESSSS, now this is a breakfast spot.  This was one of the best meals we had while visiting Las Vegas!  We stopped in on a Monday morning (I can just imagine the crowd on the weekends), to fairly full restaurant.  We were warmly greeted and seated right away.  Our server appeared immediately, filled our coffee cups (which by the way, was never empty), and proceeded to take our order.  I ordered the eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and rye toast, my husband ordered an omelette.  Our food arrived a very short time later, and we couldn't have been happier.  Everything was DELICIOUS!!!   The owner was making the rounds, making small talk and checking on customers.  The portions were generous and priced just right!   Mr. Mamas, you ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast in Las Vegas! Had to take a taxi to get here but well worth it! Very friendly staff and enthusiastic Owner greeting everyone at the door. Had the French Toast and it was unbelievable! So Yummy!"}
{"text":"We came here at 8a, the place wasn't crowded at all.   My son was wondering why the place is so empty and thought that I might have chose the wrong place but within 15 minutes the place was filled. We ordered: 
1. Mama's Short stack -  two pancakes,  2 eggs with choice of meat; pancakes are delicious.   Even though we were full but we couldn't help ourselves and so most finished all. 
2. Western omelette - super duper good.   Highly recommended. 
3. Mama's French toast - it was the bomb.com
For kids,  you should just order egg and toast with additional side order if needed. 
Service here is excellent.   Everyone was friendly especially the owner.   He greeted you at the table and even opened the door for you.   My family love  this restaurant and will definitely come back whenever we are back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service is fantastic. Everyone, especially the owner, went the extra mile to give us a personal touch and the experience made us feel valued and not just another customer/ticket. The pancakes here are awesome, big and fluffy, and they have good hashbrowns. Hubs really liked his Greek omelette, fluffy and generous, and they subbed in red peppers instead of tomatoes at his request with no problem. I had the Eggs Benny Florentine and I was happily surprised when the waitress asked how I liked my poached eggs, no one has ever asked to make poached eggs to my taste before and most breakfast joints are too busy to accommodate that kind of level of service. The place was hopping but food moves fast and we were never waiting. Great experience to set the tone of the day from a simple meal. I really appreciate the level of service from the staff, it can't be easy."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Perfect little diner with large portions of comfort food Vegas has to offer. It was nice having breakfast off the strip away from the fuss and crowds. I love the idea of eating like the locals. It is also not that far from the airport."}
{"text":"Nick and his team are great, best breakfast or lunch in Vegas!  Can not say enough about this place a must go everytime I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"We hit this place for breakfast every time we get out to Vegas.  The owner is always there and chatting up the customers - truly a friendly guy.  The food is very good, portion sizes are great and I never leave less than stuffed.  We love this place and will continue to return each trip to vegas for an economical but good quality breakfast.   D."}
{"text":"Welcome was immediate and seating prompt. Pretty extensive menu, but went with the days special. When it came out, they messes up on both orders, which they quickly realized and apologized. They brought out new dishes, however the orders were wrong again, and not wanting to make a big deal of it, we paid the bill and left. Don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"Exceptional service.  From you enter the front door until you leave they really do their best to make sure you have a great experience.  Food was good, but nothing truly exceptional (like their service).  I'd definitely come back for breakfast if in the area, but its not something I think I'd ever have particular cravings for."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas!!!!!! Friendly, fast service. Excellent food!! Hash browns were perfect. I wish we would have found this sooner into our trip."}
{"text":"As non-locals, we turned to Yelp for a breakfast place off the strip and close to the hotel. We knew we picked the right spot since there was a wait. Not long for us thank goodness! 

This place is in a strip mall so plenty of parking. The sign has two burly guys dresses cooks but do not be frightened! They can cook! I went with the strawberry pancakes-strawberries inside and on top. Husband got the strawberry French toast. We shared hash browns with onions and peppers. As if this meal couldn't get any better, they offered flavored creamer for their delicious coffee. The bacon was crisp and not fatty. He got his eggs the way he liked them, soft scrambled, which doesn't happen often. 

There was no reason not to wait! You will not be disappointed. Service was fast and the food was hot. The host was friendly and well as the wait staff. Even if we do not stay at that hotel again we will come back if in the area."}
{"text":"This is our third time here and it's just so damn good! Cali omelet was so damn delicious. This has become our spot to eat breakfast when we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was great! There was a relatively long wait, but it was worth it. The staff was very friendly, which makes me want to come back each time we visit the area. The plate-size pancakes were yummy. My daughter's bacon cheeseburger looked delicious and required her to use both hands. If you can stand the wait, it's a nice way to start your day."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Team is very friendly and willing to help each other out. It's nice to see a working team. The chicken fried steak was great and filling. Lordes was our server. She was quick and efficient. One thing she did that exceeded my expectations was offered to go cups for our coffee that we could not finish. That made my day and helped with the long day a head of me. Thanks for the great experience. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!!!! This has fast become the favorite breakfast location for my entire family! Every Sunday morning we come after I get off work!

I love the Steak and Egg Breakfast and the Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Mr. Mamas for breakfast, and it was spot on.  The omelette was delicious, with excellent ingredient proportions.  The pancakes were extremely fluffy.  We'll definitely return for breakfast.  Another time, we went for lunch, and we found the burger, fries and onion rings competent (good, but not special).  Both times, the service was outstanding.  We were amazed at how calm the staff remained through their efficient actions, even on a very busy Sunday."}
{"text":"Went here today based on all the great yelp reviews. Mr. Mamas didn't disappoint! I had the eggs Benedict florentine, a short stack of pancakes and my bf had the biscuits and gravy. Both love our meals! The hashbrowns are heavenly. Such a simple side dish, but   they were the star of my meal. The owner was walking around chatting up the guests and helping his employees.  He seems to truly love the food industry and his job. The place felt like being at home. All the employees were so friendly. This will be a must when coming to Vegas."}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago with my husband and it was good but I think it reminds me too much of a regular American breakfast that I can get anywhere.

The restaurant is very clean, staff are very nice and the owner is working with his staff and not bossing them around- nice change nowadays!

My husband got the pancakes, a cinnamon roll, a side of bacon and I got a half size of biscuits and gravy. No doubt their food is homemade and delicious but I feel like it is nothing too spectacular. Their pancakes are delicious and has a homey smell to it and their biscuits are nice and fluffy. Their gravy is homemade as well and you get little chunks of sausage and bacon in it.

If you do get a snack, beware of the cinnamon roll! It is extremely filling and delicious! We shared one and it was pretty large and I was so full after! 

All in all, I'm sure we would come back as my husband loves American dining and I would just try something different."}
{"text":"Great food! I got the Cali omelette with egg whites which were the fluffiest egg whites I've ever had. The cinnamon rolls were also yummy  Also service was amazing! Definitely will be back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Thank you thank you thank you!!! Best people working and the food is delicious. Yes, we will be back!!! Can't beat this awesome combination!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for service.  Real friendly genuine people.

That said, I wasn't sure if it was an off day.

Pancakes were good.
Breakfast burrito was good.
Chicken fried steak was just okay (because gravy was tasted like plain flour)

The thing that wasn't that great were the way the hash browns were cooked.  They were crispy on the outside but the inside was more of a mashed potato texture.  Not sure if you have to ask for them to be extra-crispy.  Hard to gage that.

I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could and I think if we went back, they could probably correct the hash brown issue."}
{"text":"They say, \"breakfast is the most important meal of the day\". I say, it's my favorite!

After a late night in Vegas, the first thing you want in your system the next morning is a hearty meal that hits home for you. Mr. Mama's did just that for us. We walked in to a spacious room filled with a staff that greeted us with all smiles. A view of the partially open kitchen can be seen from our table and it wasn't long before our server took care of our orders, going far and beyond with her service all throughout our meal. Thank you, Abby! 

CHICKEN FRIED STEAK ($10.75) comes with 3 eggs your way, hash or home fries, and a side of carbs be it a sourdough toast or their fluffy pancake. I opted for the french toast for an extra $1.50 and it was money well spent. This meal alone can be shared between two people. Believe me when I say every part of this meal was fantastic! And that includes the hearty sausage gravy that topped the steak. Three of us ordered the same thing with different sides for variety and we were all impressed. Ideal sides for me would be two eggs sunny side up, one egg scrambled, hash browns, and their amazing pancake. Can I say, breakfast for champions?! 

CHILI (12oz bowl $5.75) to share between everyone on the table was surprisingly delicious. Though I prefer eating this with their sourdough toast than the packaged crackers it came with. More kick please!

CALI OMELETTE ($8.50) was another delightful entree packed with melted cheddar cheese and sausage, then finally topped with pico de gallo, sour cream, and fresh cut avocado for that extra creamy factor. This was another generous plate that came with your choice of two sides. Can't go wrong with this.

Impressed yet? Here's more. For an already reasonable breakfast, they have a Yelp offer for $15 off $30 worth of food and a check-in offer with 1 free beverage of your choice. Hello, fresh OJ! This deal is simply unbeatable. We may have lost some at the casino but we sure walked out of here a winner. They close at 2PM so come early!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and friendly greeting and complimentary door opening as we arrived. Equal respect as we left.  This place has done a great job with the staff. Everyone was cheerful and engaging.  Mr.  Mama's understands what guest service is all about. 

This visit (because I will be back) I went for the Greek Omlette with hash browns, wheat toast and coffee. This generous helping of a 4 egg omlette definitely gave me the energy to carry me through my day.   Stuffed with tomato,  garlic,  purple onion,  spinach and creamy feta cheese,  this omelet was delicious.  My hash browns were cooked just the way I like em, well done and crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.  The only down fall was they were a little slow to refill the coffee but I will not deduct stars for this.  The 5 star service made up for it."}
{"text":"I love the new location they have more room to accommodate more people. The breakfast was fantastic I had the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy It was delicious. My brother ordered the eggs Benedict and he love it and my dad ordered the omelet. We all liked our food and the service."}
{"text":"Excellent, great service. Owner knew the exact % of Californians that come into his business."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is ridiculously yummy, not quick and greasy...probably the best breakfast I've ever had. Owner welcomes you as you arrive, the staff is super helpful and fast, the place is super clean and the food is out of this world! I am a fan for life and will frequent every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing customer service, and great prices!  I ordered the veggie breakfast wrap and it was so delicious! The staff were all very nice and helpful. If I'm in town again, I definitely want to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Just wow. We stumbled upon this place out by one of my cousins,  and they had never heard about it.  Upon arriving we found a long line out the door, good sign about the popularity but we were worried about the wait.  Our worry was unjustified we were seated and placing out orders within 20 mins.  The wait staff was extremely attentive,  the place was packed but not too loud and the food was wonderful.   I had the steak and eggs, it was perfectly cooked, with no fat , and the hashbrowns were amazing.   My wife had the chicken fried steak again perfectly cooked and the gravy was to die for , it was like liquid sausage.   Highly recommended,  and definitely someplace I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Always a great time gere! The owner of this place is just an amazing guy! We went to his old location last year and just fell in love with the food. This new location is much bigger and the service is great. The only thing that made this place a 4 star rather than a 5 star was the unorganized staff, servers were standing around by the register acting like they were working,  talking crap about how they would rather be home cleaning than be here. (Our server: Julie C.) She kept complaining. Some of the girls were walking around with their cups making themselves drinks.  Overall great place and food. Definitely will come back next year when we do our annual mini getaway."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time & the food was really good! Other than waiting to order because our server was taking care of a larger party, the service was great! The owners & manager was on top of things & the manager came around and greeted us for small talk. I had the veggie omelet with toast and hash browns & that omelet was the best veggie omelet I've ever had!  It is a smaller restaurant, so I would assume that there will be a wait to be seated majority of the time because of its higher reviews. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The prices are affordable and the portions are hefty!"}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast in LAS Vegas so far. Great friendly serve and amazing food. Our party shared the chicken fried steak, chili, and the Cali omelet. I also recommend the hot cinnamon roll which was warm and fresh.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"MR MAMAS is the absolute  *B*E*S*T*   BREAKFAST LOCATION IN THE LAS VEGAS AREA...

Make sure to go to their ***NEW LOCATION*** one light West on Russell Rd/Jones Blvd!

I have eaten there dozens of times, traveling all the way from Henderson.  Well worth the 15 minute drive.  Great food, great service, and great prices!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best traditional breakfast spot in the valley.  If your looking for a real good homemade breakfast - well look no further. First off the Staff here are courteous and friendly. The owner here couldn't be anymore welcoming. He treats every customer as if your family - he has a warm appreciated attitude. Anytime I have family and friends come from out of town I send them directly to Mr. Mamas for breakfast.  I have been coming here for years and they have yet to disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place off the strip.  Tasty food and excellent service. I had the chicken fried steak and it was very tasty and filling. For the price the portion size was huge, I couldn't finish my food. The steak was crispy and the home fries were cooked and seasoned to perfection. The gravy on the steak is good, but as a personal preference, I don't care for gravy. If you want quality food and want to avoid the strip prices, come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food but just about the customer service and issues with prices. I looked up the website so I could see the menu and place an order for pick up. When I arrived everything was more expensive then the online price by $.5-1. When I went back to point this out I was told that the menus they have in store show the new prices. This is really not acceptable as it is the restaurants responsibility to keep there menu prices online up to date. I would have expected them to offer to refund the difference but instead I was given excuses about how they moved a year ago and sometimes it's hard to change the menu online."}
{"text":"Off strip and wanting breakfast or lunch, this is your place. A must check out when in Vegas. Mr Mamas has a killer chicken fried steak! The service is beyond friendly and the manager who was working there at the time has an uncanny resemblance to Rick from Pawn Stars.  He says he's never seen him before but gets told that on a weekly basis lol. 

This is one of those places were it won't break your wallet and you'll leave feeling very satisfied. You'll want to eat here to get a break from the astronomical prices of the strip. Oh and our waitress was a doll as well! 

6 stars."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is definitely my favorite breakfast restaurant.  The food and customer service is top notch.  The menu is not too complicated, and typical breakfast fare is served here, yet this place still manages to stands out and be memorable.  The first time I came here, I had the chili and it was probably the best chili I've ever had.  I've had the omelets and french toast as well and they're delicious.

Mr. Mamas goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service too. Before I even entered the restaurant, the owners came out to greet me and hold the door open.  At the old location, the wait time was pretty long, but the two times that I have been to Mr. Mamas since it opened in the new location, I haven't had to wait for a table.  

When we were eating, my brother noticed a family with a young toddler walking towards the restaurant, and he saw that the owners and workers were anticipating the family's arrival and were already setting up a booster seat for the child before the family walked through the door!"}
{"text":"Visiting from East coast asked for hash and cheese omelet which is not on menu and it was amazing. I told manager they should add this as a special!! People so friendly and awesome chocolate chip pancakes. Oh and try the fresh brewed iced coffee.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Still the very best, and only a mile from the old location. Always the most amazing staff, high quality food, at exactly the right price. Every time we're in Vegas for business we make time for the short drive west from the Strip to have breakfast at this Midwestern-run winner. Absolutely LOVE Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"Great place with good food. Nothing fancy, just good solid delicious food with people who care. The owner checked in with each and every person at some point during their meal. The portions were generous and it was in the $10/meal range with drinks and sides."}
{"text":"(Yay my 100th review) I don't normally go out much for breakfast but if I had to then I would definitely recommend Mr. Mama's.   

Immediately upon arrival, my family was warmly greeted and tended to by the friendly staff.  They brought a special chair that our baby's carrier/carseat could fit into more safely than their regular chairs (that's going above and beyond good service).  Throughout the course of the meal, the staff came by to say hello and check on all their customers.  They were warm, funny, sincere.  An awesome mom & pop breakfast stop.

We used the $15 for $30 Yelp deal and it was more than enough food for my wife and I and my 3yr old.   We ordered and our breakfast came out so fast even with how busy the place was.  Nice.

I had the country fried steak and with poached eggs and hash browns.   Everything tasted great and the portion was huge.  I brought it home and it was still good later on.  The gravy they use was different, with pieces of bacon and sausage I believe mixed in.  It was good.

My wife had the Mr. Mama's french toast.  Ordered it scrambled eggs and a nice portion of ham.  The french toast came with 4 pieces powdered with sugar.

We also ordered a short stack and honestly, that was ALOT for us.  2 huge plate sized pancakes.   We wished there was an option to get our pancakes topped with either fruit or chocolate.  My daughter loves her strawberry-topped pancakes.

Finally, I also had extra from the Yelp deal, so I ordered their beef soup of the day.  There's soups with beef and then there's' Mr. Mama's beef soup.  HUGE chunks of beef.  Good broth.  

4 stars for the food and 1 more star for the GREAT service they provided.  Definitely recommending their breakfast and definitely use this awesome Yelp deal!"}
{"text":"Love that we found this little hidden gem! The french toast is my absolute favorite & I love that I can get a smaller portion. The customer service is amazing and the owners are so sweet!"}
{"text":"excellent staff and waiters that I've had in a while! very attentive, always checking on you, polite when you pass by and literally everyone you encounter will acknowledge you.  and even more the food was great! loved the pancakes and coffee! hope ton come back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food and fantastic service. The staff was so kind and made you feel right at home. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant! 

We were on vacation and yelped for a place to eat breakfast. Mr. Mama's was at the top of the suggestions. This is a great place to dine. It's a family run restaurant so the customer service experience is great, they have a home-y feel to it. 

Service and wait time was very fast and efficient. 

We tried to biscuits and gravy which is amazing! Their homemade gravy is something else. You have to try it yourself!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here twice with my girlfriend, steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy, and corned beef hash. Pretty standard good diner. Plan on returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fast service. Will go back for sure. Visiting from our of state and did t know where to eat a hardy breakfast. Looked on line and found Mr Mamas. It was close enough. Upon arrival they said it would be a 20 minute wait. It was bustling and appeared to be worth it. It was."}
{"text":"Hands down the place place to eat breakfast or lunch in Las Vegas. Here's now my go to for breakfast whenever I'm in town. Forget the cafes or restaurants in casinos or in the strip. This is the place. You get the same quality or better food with a better service for a lot less. Service is here is extremely great. 
Also killer pancakes. Try them for sure. Their mushroom cheese omelet is yummy as well."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is my go-to place for breakfast, this is one legit \"diner\"!

The owners are from the metro-Detroit area so you are guaranteed a warm Midwestern greeting! Don't believe me, just check out all of the other reviews stating that the owners & staff are always stopping by your table to make sure you are pleased with everything. 

Never once has my coffee mug been less than half full, they even remember to ask if I want regular or french vanilla creamer! As a creature of habit I always get scrambled eggs with hash browns and sausage patties. Every time the eggs are cooked to fluffy goodness, hash browns are perfectly crispy & those patties are super juicy!

Locals and visitors alike, get your butts to Mr Mamas if you are missing a home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"I went to Mr. Mama's before they moved to this location (back when they were more of a hole in the wall) and LOVED it. Now they're location is large and in charge which makes me all the more happier for them. If you're looking for some good ol' dinner food then get in here and order their breakfast. Staff is friendly, and I personally always get their french toast."}
{"text":"We've been here about 6-7 times in the last two years and never had a bad experience. They are on it in every way. I especially love the owner who greets you when you walk in. So far to date this is the best breakfast place in Vegas that I've tried."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I come to vegas about once a month and I make it a point to stop here. The food is always fresh and delicious. The service is always helpful. You can't get a much better breakfast experience for the price."}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this place. Every time we come from la we come here for breakfast. Someone always opens the door for us and greets us. I have a 5 month old. Every time I come here, everyone is trying to help me with a high chair. These people truly care about people and care about the experience they have at their location. I'm not one to review places but this place absolutely deserves it. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This Is The BEST Breakfast By Far Here In Vegas!!!
Try The Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs W/Sausage Gravy Along W/Biscuits & Pancakes!! INCREDIBLE!! Excellent Service!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch on Father's Day. My son and I were seated within 5 minutes. Place was packed but it didn't stop the service from being great. Jasmine was our waitress and she was awesome along with the rest of the wait staff. I was checked on by at least 3 different servers to see how we were doing and in my book, that's being amazingly attentive to their guests. My son ordered the breakfast sandwich and I had the steak and eggs. Ribeye is a little thinner than what I expected so I'll make sure to get it rare instead of medium rare, was more on the medium well side but that's probably because of thinness of the steak. Still doesn't take away that this place had great food and 
A+++++ service. Will be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing. The food was awesome!!!! The service is friendly and extremely inviting. Everyone one said hello & everyone said goodbye. Prices were best in town"}
{"text":"Our breakfast tradition we make before heading home from Vegas trips. Such delicious food for good prices. The chicken fried steak and omelettes are delicious. The french toast is my daughters favorite. Home fries are so yum (add onions and peppers if you like them)! Their service is great.  Can't wait till next Vegas run."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the service, food and overall environment.    Want outstanding food and service this place is a must in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly local diner atmosphere. Greeted at door. Food was great portion for the price and excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My last review for the Decatur location I gave these guys 5 stars. I was ecstatic when they moved to this location for it is about twice the size and the parking is more than plentiful. If there was a candidate for 6 stars this would be the place! Because if the old location is as good as it gets then this new location just made it even better!

Now as we made our way in the first time one sunday morning, there were people waiting to be seated. I asked what the wait time was and they said about 10 minutes. THEY LIED! But in a good way. After about 5 minutes we were seated with menus in hand. 

I was kind of afraid that with the bigger size of the place that the great service that we have come to expect might have gone downhill a bit. Im happy to report that they are chugging right along! Service was spectacular! Like they never left the old location! What I love about the service is that they always seem to have plenty of servers running around. Not only do you have your main server, but other servers help out as well whether its picking up your empty plates, refills, or bringing out your order as soon as its done.

As for the food, if you refer to my last review it is still the same. These guys are mainly a breakfast place but you do have other options as well like burgers, sandwiches, wraps, subs, salads, etc. If you are really hungry I have to mention the Mama's Burger ($11.95). Two half pound beef patties, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, avocado and an onion ring. I thought I was really hungry when I ordered this but I was so wrong. It's basically like eating two burgers. Might as well cut it in half and share!

For you omelet lovers, I highly recommend getting the Cali Omelet ($8.50). It has cheddar jack cheese, sausage, pico de gallo, sour cream, and then topped with avocado. We always have them add bacon to it because bacon makes anything better. This meal comes complete with your choice of home fries or hash browns. I usually get hash browns for they cook it so crispy. You also get your choice of toast from sourdough, white, or wheat. I always get sourdough and they automatically butter it for you.

Some useful info. They used to have a 15 for 30 dollar Yelp deal but I did not see it last time we went but if it comes back you definitely want to take full advantage of it. What took its place is a free beverage with the purchase of an entree with check in. Their business hours are Monday thru Friday 6 am to 3 pm. Saturday and Sunday 7 am to 2 pm. 

In closing, the drive is worth the trip here and you are not too far away from the strip. It's definitely a nice change of pace from those marked up so called fancy places.

Yelp 2015 Review #38 \"Mr Mama got that good stuff!\"
537 overall"}
{"text":"Mr Mamas food is absolutely delicious. Large portions, and the sausage and hash browns are heavenly. The Denver omelette was very good. The short stack and the stack were fantastic! The mamas wrap was amazing. Service was great, the waiters were very nice. Coffee was delicious. Prices were very reasonable. One of the best breakfast places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Any establishment where the owner is present and touches every table is a place that I want to eat in. The staff was so friendly and nice and the food was just as good. I had the steak and eggs for 11.99. It's a great portion for the price and the steak was cooked correctly and so tender! I'm glad we found a nice little spot with really fresh food and the best coffee. Thank you for taking such good care of us today!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, larger is not always better. Had the cinnamon roll and hubby had pancakes. The pancakes was tastier than the roll.  I give it a 4 because service was great and it looks like a program they might be running for teenagers. I think it's great what this establishment is doing for the teens!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Buscuits  and gravy were very unique and tasty. Staff was incredibly considerate and friendly."}
{"text":"We showed up for our last meal before our flight home to Chicago. It's hard to walk in as a party of 6 and get seated quickly but they did in a matter of minutes. 
The food was phenomenal, I recommend the Omelette and the Cinnamon Rolls. 
In the event I'm ever in town again I will definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"Best service in Las Vegas.  Owner Nick is phenomenal.  Friendly staff. Great food. Worth the wait. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place a while back and finally tried it today. Food was simple and delish and super friendly service. I ordered the eggs and meat plate and it comes with hash brown already and I was craving pancakes too and the girl said she can substitute the toasts that comes with it with a pancake for me so I didn't have to order extra so my total was under $8! I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are quite large for how much you pay! Love the old time feeling of the diner too. Staff is very friendly to greet you at the door. Though they were very busy we got a table at a pretty reasonable time. Over all very pleased with my experience here."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to grab a quick bite, just to kill some time before work. After a Google search, Mr. Mamas popped up, and was within a mile. So I stopped in. It's sad, I must say, that this level of customer service and human interaction are not the norm. Before I could even ENTER the establishment, I was greeted at the door by Kat (I hope I got that right - in hindsight she deserved to be remembered) with a tremendous smile and a heart-felt greeting. I was promptly seated. My server came over in very short time (Roneisha, I believe), who very kind, professional, and spoke to me directly (eye contact carries weight). Food was delicious (nothing fancy - oatmeal and two hard-scrambled eggs), but the SERVICE...almost finished with my meal (I am not at all opposed to dining alone), a gentleman approached and asked about the experience so far. Mr. Mama himself. So kind, so engaging, along with the staff (others asked about my experience, as well, and if they could do anything more). I will definitely be returning. I dont typically write these, but this was absolutely worthy of the effort. Even in leaving, well-wishes and confirmation of a positive experience. Breakfast was affordable, but the human decency, the warm interactions, they genuine concern, the KINDNESS: priceless, and hard to find. Here's a place. If there WAS a downside, its that Mr. Mama is a Michigan man (Go Bucks!), but I cant find it in my heart to hold that against him. Wonderful experience in a time where my soul benefitted from that visit tremendously."}
{"text":"It is the best place for breakfast you can come to. Service and food are great. I will come back for sure when back in Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Mr. Mamas mid-morning on Thursday as we were on our way out of Vegas. We were instantly greeted by a very friendly staff member and got seated right away. Our waitress took our order on her iPhone and asked pretty thorough questions to make sure that we got our food exactly how we wanted (ex: do you want medium or crispy bacon, do you want medium or crispy hash browns). The food came out quickly and was delicious at very reasonable prices. Would go again of we're back in the area!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak is the best!!! The owners really make you feel like family:) Love this place"}
{"text":"My Hubby is a buttermilk pancake fan and these got his thumbs up approval.He also had the Chili omelet and it had homemade Chile that evidently they have been make for years.It was really good as I couldn't resist on taking a bite.  I like that I can build my own omelet and yes they have eggs whites.Had a bite of my daughters turkey bacon and cooked to perfection Service was great and most importantly the food. Next trip back we will be there."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here and I was tackled at the door with world-class service!  I was seated inside of a minute and had a hot cuppa joe in front of me the following minute.  The basics:  \"A\" grade posted by the health department, clean restaurant, spotless restroom and hot water to wash my paws.  Did I mention the friendly service?  I had the 3-meat omelette special that put me back $13 (omelette, drink, toast and hash browns).  I subbed the potatoes with tomatoes (doctor's orders).  The omelette was perfectly cooked and arrived hot. I didn't mention it but I was in a hurry.  Regardless, I was out the door w/in 25 minutes. I love a great local restaurant!  Can't wait to bring friends and family here.  I could've paid 3-4 times as much for breakfast on the Strip...glad I didn't.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat the food is very delicious the customer service is outstanding
I had an omalate with spinach and cheese It was very good. I really enjoyed eating there I highly recommend this restaurant to any one is way better then IHOP,  Dennis or any other restaurant I can't wait to go back and try a different dish"}
{"text":"THEE BEST chicken-fried steak I've ever had.  So tender that I didn't need a knife to cut it.  Breading was crispy & the gravy was outstanding.  I asked for extra crispy hash browns & that was exactly what I git. It was perfect. 
Mr. Mama came by to thank us for eating there & to see if everything was alright.  Our waitress was very friendly & gave us great suggestions on what to order when we told her that this is our 1st time there."}
{"text":"Out of towner here so I came specifically based on the reviews and me and my hubby were not disappointed ! We absolutely loved this place! The whole team there was amazing,  customer service was on point and the food?! Bomb.com! Love ! Love! Love this spot! When we come back to town, this is a definite stop."}
{"text":"This has to be THE best place for breakfast in Las Vegas! Amazing food! Amazing service! Huge portions. The friendliest people. The owner walks around, taking his time to talk to customers and get to know them. He talks to everyone and makes you feel very welcome. He even recommends different things to do in Vegas to those who are not local. I will always recommend this place for breakfast to friends visiting town. Love the new location. I just wish there was another located in Henderson, closer to where I live."}
{"text":"1st, I have to give a big thank you to the staff at Mr. Mamas for a superb job of serving and attending. 2nd, It's because of great leadership provided by the owner, that creates such an atmosphere in which these employees work.
Now on to the fare served here. If you would like to enjoy a \"home cooked meal\" in a restaurant setting, it doesn't get any better than this.
I brought friends from out of state here for their first taste of Vegas. It happened to be my first visit here also. We all were most impressed by this off the strip hidden jewel. This will be our go to place for breakfast in a peaceful atmosphere. Thanks for a job well done to the owner and staff here at Mr. Mamas."}
{"text":"This place has very nice employees. The western and cali omelette are really good! As well as their famous cinnamon bun!"}
{"text":"Holy fk! So good! Cannot say enough good things. The coffee is on point and my eggs benedict were stellar!! The home fries....ooooooooh! Lenore is more than helpful and her recommendations were spot on!"}
{"text":"The hype is real. I will drive the 10 miles out of my way to have breakfast here. 

First off, everyone is super friendly. The owner is right there at the front door greeting customers as they walk in. He also walks around to every table to ensure everything is superb. The servers go out of their way to make you happy and always have a smile on their face. 

As for the food, DELICIOUS! We have tried almost everything from the menu. Corned beef hash, French toast, breakfast wrap, burger, salad...and nothing has disappointed us. My favorite thing on their menu has to be their hash browns. I always get them well done. They are crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. So so good. Their coffee is also good and smooth. Portions and pricing are right. 

Like I said, if you are looking for a solid breakfast joint with good service, this is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"Loved Mr. Mama's! Fast paced family run diner with great breakfast, large portions and friendly staff. Expect a wait, but they manage their wait line efficiently and move people through effectively. I had the florentine benedict with hashbrowns. Hubby had steak and eggs. Both were nicely prepared, good portions, served promptly and tasty. Mr. Mama's is located in a shopping center west of the strip with ample parking. A great off the strip alternative!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm not sure what I'm missing... did I come in a bad day? I saw all the reviews on this place and thought that there was no way I could miss out. Came here about a week and a half ago in the middle of the week. Not much of a crowd so we were seated immediately.

Definitely a working class environment. Gives you a break from the strip and the tourist vibe for sure. One thing we did notice was the cleanliness of the restaurant. About half the tables were set and a lot of the other tables still hadn't been cleared or bussed. 

We were handed menus and our drink order was taken. About 10 minutes later our server finally came back and abruptly asked us what we are going to have. No suggestions, no asking if it was our first time, nothing really above and beyond for service.

We decided to try out a few things. A lot of the reviews said the biscuits and gravy were to day for us so we had an order of that. I give this a 2/5. The gravy was slightly bland. A mediocre style country gravy with sausage. The biscuits is where I had my issue. The biscuits themselves were very dense and bland as well. Not flaky at all and no real taste of buttermilk.

I had a Greek omelette. I believe it was the Greek. Had spinach tomatoes onions and feta cheese. The egg was overcooked. The egg was extremely dry. And the amount of ingredients in it was very scarce. Hardly any feta cheese except for the pieces falling out. Another 2/5.

Ordered the French toast. Was I surprised at the portion size. It literally looked like two pieces of wonder bread that had been slightly dipped in egg batter and thrown on the grill dinner plate. You won't find any of that large brioche style French toast here are thick juicy pieces of bread. Another 2/5.

Last was the California omelette or something along that lines. Vegetarian with avocado on top. Same thing as the last omelette. Very dense and dry. Eggs are definitely over cooked. Hashbrowns are decent. Pretty sure their bag frozen not fresh but still tasted OK. Gave this I'm at a three out of five.

We would've said something to the waitress but as soon as the food came we never saw her again until she came back to abruptly drop the check with half of our food still on the plates.

Like I said, we really wanted to like this place but didn't see what the hype is about. Slightly above grade of Denny's but there's a few other places in the area that are a little bit better and are at the same price point. But hey to each there own."}
{"text":"We love eating at Mr. Mamas when in Vegas... off the strip, you can share as the portions are a good size, price is great and food is AWESOME!!  We always share and order one or two things on the side. The owner was in and very down to earth and personable.  It is also not to far off the strip depending on where u are staying..."}
{"text":"Found this place the first week I moved here from CA.I was greeted by owner Nick,who instantly treated me as family.The food is simple,fresh American fare.It is done to perfection!All the girls who work there,care you stopped by.There are lots of place here in LV..but none like this.From Daughter,Jenna to Abby,Julie, you are taken care of,something lacking nowadays at other places.Having eaten there breakfast and lunch,I can find no fault.They are attentive,but do not rush you out.Nick,floats around and really talks with everyone!I love this place.Please try it,you will love it as I do!"}
{"text":"Have been here mutiple in the past 2 months! Amazing food, coffee, service, just absolutely incredible. I've yet to find another place where the owner is there almost every time I walk in, and on top of that he actually stops at your table, asks you how your doing, makes sure the food is to your liking, and thanks you for your business. I just can't say enough about this great breakfast & lunch establishment!!! 5 stars every time!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service was even better. Didn't plan to but went back for the second day of our trip here in Vegas.  This place is good."}
{"text":"More food than any human can eat. The pancakes are as big as a dinner plate. The owner welcomes and speaks to everyone at some point. They even have smooth grits for us Southerners We've eaten there for breakfast and lunch. All were excellent. We will make a point to go back when we return to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Impeccable service and absolutely delicious food. The owner greets you upon arrival. The staff is fast and friendly. They are extremely fast to get you your food and help you, however I don't feel rushed. It's a great atmosphere. Kind of like a small town diner feel to it. Haven't had a thing on the menu that I don't like. The new location makes it even better!"}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas this weekend, we decided to eat breakfast at Mr. Mamas on Saturday morning. We had never been there before and to our surprise we really liked their breakfast. I would have to give this restaurant a four and a half star. I ordered one pancake, a cheese and bacon omelet, breakfast potatoes, and toast. We also added their famous cinnamon roll to our order. As everyone knows who reads my Yelp, I like when food is well seasoned. Their potatoes were very well seasoned and they give you a good portion size. The pancake was a buttermilk pancake which was fluffy and good. They make homemade cinnamon rolls which were served soft and warm. The customer service was excellent. Everyone was so welcoming and willing to serve. The prices were not bad but they charge 1.25 if you want salsa on the side. We would definitely return to this breakfast spot. 

They also serve lunch."}
{"text":"This was the first time we visited Mr. Mama's, and it won't be the last either. The atmosphere was very friendly, the staff - very attentive, and the food was really really tasty. We only waited for a few minutes to be seated even though they had a rush. The manager (owner?) was on the ball and he kept it rolling.  

I ordered mama's short stack. The pancakes were made from scratch and it was really fluffy. My husband's chicken fried steak was also made very well. The sauce they had on it was best we've tried in a while. It was a thick blanket of sausage in white sauce."}
{"text":"In from Denver and came here.  Owner Nick and his team are awesome.   Great service, wonderful food at good prices.  If I lived in Vegas I would be a regular here"}
{"text":"I was trying to be very mean cuz the experience wasn't that much good. 
I tried a little bit of everything. The biscuit and gravy was ok but I do not like the gravy at all. The pancake was huge, light/blend, and normal. The cinnamon roll was expensive but so disappointing that I only had two bites... it wasn't flavorful and the texture didn't taste fresh, to be complete honest, I would very much prefer the cinnabun.
My friend had the country fried chicken steak, it tastes different and a bit weird. It's s nice try but may not be a constant option.
We waited for at least 20 minutes before the server came to give us the check."}
{"text":"Here's what happened, 

We find Mr Mamas on Yelp and it looks good so we go.  Not even before we made it in the door did we start seeing why it was rated so well.  I mean, we were walking from the truck to the restaurant and the front doors fly open, the owner pops his head out, and with a jolly bellow calls \"Good Morning you three! Get in here, it Breakfast time. We've been waiting for ya!\" Like the most jovial and friendly Grandpa/Dad/Santa figure you'd meet! (Btw-he looks nothing like Santa...I'm just setting the scene, go with it) 

He was just the first of many friendly faced staff members.  Everyone was totally on point with the Customer service.  The Manager stoped to talk to each table and was super personable and authentic with each, she lingered, but not too long.  A true art.  

The food was good! We had Cornebeef Hash, the Short Stack, and a Veggie Omelet.  Portions are substantial but not out of control.  The flavor was solid, not really elevated at all, but truly solid! A great diner with AMAZING staff. go and support this place if breakfast is the craving!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is the diner experience, optimized, and I mean this is the best and warmest way possible. We were not just greeted at the door, but the door was opened for us and we were personally welcomed. I assume each group of four or so tables is assigned its own waiter/ess, as our waitress was with us instantly to recommend food options, take our orders, refill our coffee, and get our bill at the end. We didn't even have to ask for to-go cups of coffee at the end of our meal - she asked if we wanted them before we had a chance! Then, just as we stood up, the person busing tables asked if he could \"pre-bus\" our table for us. This is as efficient as a diner can be while remaining personal.

Not only was the service incredible, but the food was, of course, delicious. My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was described as a sausage gravy with a hint of maple and it did not disappoint! Incredible over thick pan biscuits. I had the French toast, which was also yummy. It came with a lot of food, so I didn't finish all of it. My only complaint would be that the coffee was a little watery, but it didn't distract from the meal as a whole.

Take the time to drive off the strip and enjoy an incredible diner experience!"}
{"text":"I always come here when were in Vegas. One of the highlights of oue trip. Great service and the food is always fresh tasting. Thanks again from The Oronaz, Riverside Cali."}
{"text":"Third or fourth time here while in Vegas for a week. By far the absolute best breakfast place ever. Have eaten a different breakfast each time & have not been disappointed at all.  Short drive from downtown but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good helpings great service great people 

It's always nice to see the owner giving a warm welcome and gracious good byes as well as inviting you to return!  I've eaten here since it opened on Decatur in a place with a 1/3 If the tables and the owner hasn't changed he understands the importance of taking the time be personally interested in customer satisfaction"}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive service. The staff aim to make you feel like family. Traditional breakfast dishes, all high quality. Everything tastes homemade, rather than the food-service fare of many other joints."}
{"text":"First, Shawn opens the the door for you when you get to Mr. Mamas. Makes you feel special especially when  you're in a wheelchair like myself. We got seated immediately and of course I order my biscuits and gravy. They ARE different here because the gravy is very delicious because it has big chunks of sausage. Now mind you Shawn is always making sure you don't need anything.  Now after you're done with your coffee, biscuits and gravy,  eggs, bacon and pancakes you pay your bill which came out to $26. Pretty good deal when you and your husband eat a savory   breakfast in Vegas. Then Shawn of course bids you farewell and pleasant travels back home. We will definitely make this spot a definite stop when we're back in Vegas!!!!!! Thank you Shawn and Mr. MAMAS for a wonderful ending to my birthday weekend."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food yet and I'm leaving this 5star review.

I showed up on a relatively busy Friday morning.  I'm new to Vegas and this was the first restaurant to pop up in my google search.  

As the hostess takes my name, she tells me that the wait is supposed to be 30 minutes but she can see if we can get me seated quicker since I'm by myself.

Sure enough the manager (I assume) let's me know that the seating will probably be 15-20 minutes.  I'm like perfect!  No rush.  I honestly didn't mind having to wait 30 minutes.  I probably only waited about 7-10 minutes.

As they walked me to my seat, two employees greeted me and thanked me for coming in.  When I sat down, I saw the manager compliment a family as they left the restaurant.

I'm so glad I came here today."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff. Good food, but it came out cold.  We had already been waiting almost an hour with our waiting time and waiting for food. We were so hungry that we just ate it anyways. Again it was good, but just cold."}
{"text":"Oh man, what can I say except Great! Great! AND Great! Forget IHOP, Dennys and those other chain restaurants. If you want great breakfast come to Mr. Mamas. Add to the fact that there was a $15 for $30 voucher and I would give this place 6 stars. Overall, great food for a reasonable price. I had the basic but very delicious Mama Short Stack with Ham. Got the ham and it was done to perfection. Savory with all the juices still inside. In addition my pancakes were just about as awesome as you can get! They were just so FLUFFY! Overall, great place, great food, great atmosphere and the owner comes by and chats with you as well! Wish there were more hometown breakfast places like this in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious hometown breakfast place. Charming atmosphere, A+ breakfast food and great staff! Right off the 215 Jones exit I will come here again for some great local Las Vegas breakfast food :) 

It's so great to find small town comforts like these."}
{"text":"Our meal was EXCELLENT! Our server Claudia was amazing and friendly had had great customer service. The food was delicious, I had the Marty Wrap. Definitely suggest it to anyone looking for some good breakfast eats."}
{"text":"This was my first stop when I hit town.  I couldn't wait to get another one of Mr Mama's magnificent chicken fried steaks.  

Chicken fried steak and eggs isn't something I usually have for breakfast.  In fact, I had never had it for breakfast before having it here.  My mom occasionally made chicken fried steak when I was growing up, but we always had it for dinner.  It's rather a lot of food for breakfast, but Mr Mama's is cool with it if you don't finish it all.

I was really looking forward to this meal.  I had been thinking about their chicken fried steaks ever since I first tried one back in July.   Mr Mama's did not disappoint!

Last time I ordered the gravy on the side because I was concerned I might not like it.  Well, the gravy is outstanding, and I found I like it better served right on the steak.  Last time I got toast, and it was great.  This time I changed it up and ordered a biscuit instead.  SCORE!  The biscuit was outstanding!  And what made it really special was that they split the biscuit, then grill the insides to a crisp toasty finish.  Baby, that's some good biscuit!

The service, again, was absolutely wonderful.  I ordered hot tea.  My waitress made sure I had a fresh cup, a 2nd teabag and hot water half way through my first cup so my second cup would be ready when my first one was finished.   

I can't wait to visit Mr Mama's again.  As much as I love the chicken fried steak, I think I'll try something else on the menu next time.  All I know is, whatever I get, I'm definitely getting a little biscuit and gravy on the side.  


Mikey C says: Love me some Mr Mama's!"}
{"text":"Large portions, good food. Owner is friendly and personable. Pancakes are ah-mazing!!!"}
{"text":"AmaZing service by each wait staff.  Delicious food!  Fried steak and eggs were the BOMB!!!  Worth every penny and every bite. 
Will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"They welcomed us with open doors. Like seriously they swung open both doors and welcomed us in. We kinda felt like royalty. The food was good and reminded us of home cooking. My mom was in love with the Hamburger and the salad was beautiful. They were genuinely nice, the way it should be!  When my daughter spilled half the syrup over her pancake they took care of it and made her feel better. The bill was not bad at all for 5 of us. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy grail of breakfast in Vegas. No tourists allowed just a great people! Great owner who cares and a staff that is attentive. Omelette was delicious as always with a price point that you can easily handle. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place was very busy, but very efficient. The food was fresh and tasted great. A lot of traditional breakfast items done right and some unique wraps and omelets. I had the greek omelet and my friend had a breakfast plate with pancakes (tasted those and they were traditional and fluffy!).. The home fries were good, and I recommend adding the peppers and onions, of course. The staff was very friendly and on point. We even had a few different employees check on us throughout breakfast. Coffee and water refills were always available when we needed them. It's a large restaurant with many tables to accommodate how busy they are. The cinnamon rolls looked awesome!! We didn't notice those until we saw another table get them, next time :) Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Everyone walked around asking if everything was great and if we needed anything else. Food was also really good. The corned beef hash was bomb. Pancakes are also really good but really big! Great spot and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! The service is on point, the food is great and the price is just right. Don't miss out on the sausage gravy!"}
{"text":"Their slogan, \"our place will put a smile on your face,\" couldn't be more true. Good food and service within a warm and accommodating atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I come here once a week with my baby girl. After I drop my son off at preschool we get to have girl time and this is a great place to have breakfast with my daughter. Everyone is always so nice, remembers what we order, and the food is great.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and awesome service.  Thank you for treating us so well!"}
{"text":"The servers go above and beyond and it's actually really refreshing to find a place that cares. We'll be coming back every time we're in town. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place has the best breakfast hands down in Vegas. Anytime we go to Vegas we make the choice to drive away from the strip to eat breakfast here. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had several places in Vegas bookmarked from Yelp's Top 100 lists and Mr. Mamas was the first to be crossed off the list. They're in a strip mall with heavily tinted windows, giving the impression that no one is in. Once you're inside, you'll see how happenin' the place is. There was a 15-20 minute wait on Sunday morning at 10:30 am. It's worth it though, so tough it out by using the waiting time to pick what you want to order and see what others have ordered.

We got an all brunch spread with a cinnamon roll ($3.75), a pancake ($2.85), a side order of 2 sunny side up eggs ($3.00), a meat & cheese omelet with home fries and toast ($9.75), and coffee ($2.50). First up was the cinnamon roll - the size of a dinner plate. It's a must order. I knew the cinnamon roll would be filling so I only ordered one pancake, rather than a stack of two. It too was the size of a dinner plate and was oh so fluffy. The omelet comes with your choice of ham, sausage or bacon for meat and your choice from over six variety of cheeses (we ordered Monterey jack, but somehow got American cheese when the omelet came). BF thought the home fries were the circular ones in the Yelp photos, but they were cubed crisp seasoned potatoes. So so good! Two pieces of toast accompanies the omelet as well.

Service was fantastic. BF's coffee cup never went empty for long. They also helped us take a picture when noticing us taking pictures of the food. Mr. Mamas himself went the effort of taking a high level shot by standing on a chair to get a full shot of us at the table with all the food included.

We left full -- too full! -- and ready to take a lazy Sunday nap."}
{"text":"Came here for my Birthday breakfast it's a pretty cool place. They have the best tasting bacon I've had a restaurant in a long time . I think they oven cook it which is my favorite way to prepare bacon. The cinnamon roll was ok. My wife ordered short stack pancakes  which I wouldn't order again, not enough flavor development.  Neither would I get the cinnamon roll. My eldest ordered the breakfast burrito which her and my wife said was the best thing on table. My youngest had the chicken fried steak breakfast which lacked some seasoning but it was ok. They delivered our parfait late it was average at best. Overall, its a nice place, the staff were super friendly and helpful but the food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"First time here a couple of weeks ago , my husband and I go out to eat quite often we were kind of getting tired of the same old spots I googled and this place came up, it was very good, kind of a long wait but the waitress stopped by our table and said they had a mix up in the kitchen fine no big deal we understand but overall cute place the food was good and very  friendly staff  we might be back who knows. So many spots to try its endless here"}
{"text":"Been to the new location a couple times now, they still need a bigger place! They must be doing something right, always a wait but worth it, the garlic spinach egg white omelet was awesome- service great too- Mr Mama himself even stopped by to check on us! Our must stop when we're in town!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something....Mr Mama's earns every single one of those 5 stars! This is another example of why I love using Yelp! to find new places to check out!

I LOVE breakfast foods. No, really... I truly LOVE breakfast foods soo much. Omelettes, eggs, french toast, sausage, and on and on and on..so I had this place bookmarked for a while.

We walked in this morning and were instantly greeted with a \"Happy 4th of July\" greeting from Mr Mama himself! Wow! Ok..that was cool! The place was busy but we were still seated right away and our friendly waitress went over the specials of the day. There were so many items I wanted to try from the get go, but I decided on a classic fave of mine - steak and eggs! My friend got the same thing, so than we decided to split an order of french toast just to try something else out.

Service here is incredible! The waitress and owner were so friendly and personable! They were attentive without being intrusive. The service here was simply sheer perfection on this day!

...and the food! Wow! Everything was cooked so fresh and tasted fantastic! I prefer my steaks medium rare and often time run into places that will overcook it. Not Mr Mama's! This steak was cooked to perfection and was seasoned beautifully! Even the hash browns were cooked just right! So frickin' tasty!

It is a 100% guarantee that I will be back here, and quite often, to try different menu items! The prices here are very fair and reasonable, but the food, and especially the service, are incredible! 

Woohoo! As good as it gets!

5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was just as good as the reviews I read! Nick was very friendly and very attentive. His staff is just as amazing! We stopped here on our way back home to Phoenix, and we were very pleased! Definitely will be back..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast off the strip. Super clean, great food and unbelievably good service with a smile."}
{"text":"This is a must every time we visit Las Vegas.  Sometimes there is a bit of a wait to get a table, but it is well worth it. Between friends and family we have sampled a large selection of the menu and everything is always excellent.  Portions are large and prices are good. I work in the tourism industry in Santa Barbara California and always recommend Mr.Mamas to anyone headed to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit this place today. When you see ratings this high you have no choice but to try it. Being sick of casino food we decided to try it. Everything exceeded my expectations.  The owner works the front like a seasoned vet. Energetic and ready to please. So many employees working like a well oiled machine everyone helping each other. 
 
  The food was amazing. IT really tasted fresh. It seems more and more restaurants are beginning to have that artificial taste with cheese and eggs but not Mr Mama's. I ordered a Spanish omelette. Eggs were fluffy, cheese and spinach tasted great, was covered with fresh avocado. The hash browns were crispy and full of flavor. To top it off the coffee was great. Not like that burnt crap you get at every diner. 
  Bottom line I just straight loved this place. This will be my stop every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast joint in Las Vegas! To Black Bear, Egg Works, Omelet House, Hash House, Cracked Egg, and whoever else is out there: Bow down to your new king. Mr. Mamas runs this town now! Consistently TOP NOTCH breakfast and lunch. My personal favorite is the Greek Omelet; a beautifully cooked omelet stuffed with onions, spinach, garlic and Feta cheese. Everything goes together so perfectly, it's to die for. Literally, if I ever served some sort of sentence in Death Row for whatever reason and had to choose a last meal, the Greek Omelet is a very strong contender for the spot. They are just as good with everything else too. Pancakes are beautifully fluffy and tasty as hell. Burgers are thick and juicy. Bacons wonderfully crispy. So on and so forth. 

On top of all the wonderful food is even more wonderful people that work there. The owner (I think his name is Nick, yeah let's go with Nick), is quite possibly the friendliest person that's ever existed. No matter how busy the place is (It's ALWAYS busy by the way, so please be prepared for around a ten to fifteen minute wait. Don't be some passive-aggressive sourpuss like some people I saw the other day), he has an incredibly warm and friendly personality. He always makes it a point to greet every single person that comes in. He will always come by and check if everything is up to par (and it ALWAYS is, actually, screw \"up to par\" it's always a goddamn double birdie). He'll strike up candid conversation with anybody willing to have a conversation (He'll be sure to keep his distance if you look like you don't want to be bothered just as well, worry not introverted people!). His servers are just as great too, incredibly friendly and just RIGHT ON TOP OF IT when it comes to serving you. I only had to wait a couple minutes in a FREAKING PACKED HOUSE until my food arrived. I also don't think I held an empty glass for more than a minute. As soon as I finished my water or coffee, they'd have it refilled in an instant, while they're tending to a billion other people in the restaurant and just staying incredibly friendly on top of it. Nick, you better be paying these guys and girls great salaries, because they sure as hell deserve it!

The closest thing to a \"criticism\" I could give this place would be it's lack of the more specialized things. For instance, in terms of hot sauce, they only carry Cholula and Regular Tabasco I think. No Habanero of Jalapeño Tabasco if you're into that sort of thing. No obscure hot sauce that you could only buy in some small city if you're into that sort of thing. The same goes with coffee. No fancy-ass French Presses, Cappuccinos, Macchiatos, etc here. Just........coffee. I don't even think they have Hazelnut creamer. Their food while being super tasty, is also not all that exotic neither. Just your standard stuff that you could find at most similar establishments. Everything here is very \"basic\" in a way.........which is completely freaking fine with me! The QUALITY OF THEIR FOOD IS GODDAMN SPECTACULAR ON A REGULAR BASIS. Come on, my favorite basketball player of all time is Tim Duncan. He doesn't throw down jamtastic dunks or rainbow threes, he just grinds people down with pure fundamentals. I FREAKING LOVE PURE FUNDAMENTALS!!! Mr. Mama's is the Tim Duncan of the Breakfast Restaurant industry, which is obviously the best compliment in the world. It doesn't have any fancy-shmancy crap that make little difference (if any) in enjoying your restaurant experience. It just has WORLD CLASS food and customer service. If having all that means I miss out on \"Ass-Kickin Hot Sauce\" so be it."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST TIME!

Price: Look to spend about $10 per item.

Parking: large lot

Food:
Portions are HUGE.
Pancakes are fluffy and large. I would order the omelet again (+$1.50 for egg whites). I would NOT order the corned beef hash again.

Notes: Family friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Really popular place it was about a 45 minute wait for a table for 7. It is a breakfast brunch place so it closes at 2 on the weekends. I had the 1/2 order of biscuits and sausage gravy (sausage bacon maple syrup) and it was delicious. Also tried make your own omelet and short stack and it was all delicious the staff is really friendly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The prices, portions, service, and food all score high for me, and I'm betting this place goes up another star on my next visit. 

I had the French toast and the western omelette. French toast wasn't world changing, but it was good. I like salsa with my eggs. It costs 1.25 extra but it made my omelette extra delicious. Most of their omelette combos (includes regular toast and your choice of potatoes) cost less than $10, a great value. There doesn't seem to be a charge for substituting one veggie for another.   Tip: the western omelette doesn't come with cheese. No big for me, but I just assumed omelets came with cheese. 

I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their well-reviewed biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"AMAZING. 

Saw this place on yelp and wanted to try it out. Came here on a Wednesday, it was a bit crowded but that didn't stop them from having extremely great and fast service. Literally the whole staff is so friendly and welcoming. They opened the door for us when we came in and opened it for us when we left. Very homey and welcoming service. It felt like home. 

Alex was our server and he was extremely friendly, sweet and very helpful. All the servers seem to work together and help each other out, they have a very great and fast system in place. It's amazing. Our food came out literally so fast, 10 minutes max. I ordered the French toast with eggs and hash browns and my Love ordered the chicken fried steak. All of the food was delicious. Oh and the orange juice is so delicious and fresh, make sure you get a large, it's only like 25 cents more. 

Home cooked food with that amazing homey service is something you don't see too often these days but this place has it. It's big enough to accommodate smaller and larger parties. It's about 20 minutes from where we stay Henderson but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went there on Mother's Day, as expected for any restaurant on that day, there was a wait. Ours was about 40 minutes, but you could see staff working fast to clear a table when it was vacated. We asked a man if he'd eaten there before & if so what was good on menu. He said it was definitely worth the wait & he had been there many times. As for what was good on the menu, he said everything.

We had 6 in our party, plus 2 children. Adults each ordered something different & we all found our meals scrumptious with huge portions. The 2 kids had ordered the Mickey Mouse pancakes & the adults each took the ears of Mickey as the pancake was also huge, overflowing the plate.

We found each staff member we encountered to be professional & pleasant. Hostess came to our table a couple times to see if everything was okay & if we needed anything.

Definitely a place to return & recommend."}
{"text":"I visited this place during my trip to Vegas. 

 The wait....the wait to get seated was serious. It's not close to the strip,but you can tell that the locals love this place. Usually, I stick to omelettes as, I am not much of a breakfast eater. However, the wait staff \"hyped up\" the Country Fried Steak and it was just gross. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but, it tasted like grounded scrapple. You know?! That southern delicacy... And I just wasn't expecting it in Las Vegas, which is definitely not the South! The only thing I enjoyed was the lemonade and the \"Home Fries\" which are basically diced potatoes. I opted for $2 extra to add peppers. And it was decent. I will say that the price range was very good. I just wished that the food was as well. The wait staffed on 11/21 just seemed gloomy for a Monday. Overall, I wouldn't come back. Try Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful service... Definitely lived up to the hype I read from other reviewers."}
{"text":"The staff here was really friendly, the breakfast burrito was good but the chicken fried steak was just so so like it was just a frozen puck, the gravy on top was really good."}
{"text":"This is the breakfast spot whenever you're in Vegas!!! The food and service is excellent and cinnamon rolls are amazing! I myself got a Chili and Cheese omelette and it was delicious, not to mention huge. Their pancakes are also big, but they are very nice and fluffy. It was a bit packed since it was Father's Day, but we managed to get seated in about 30min. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's an okay place to go. I would equate this place to a Denny's. The only difference between this place and a Denny's is you will have to wait about 30 to 45 minutes for a table. At least at Denny's you will get seated faster but pretty much the same food."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot, with very good food. Our waitress reccomended the corned beef hash, it was the best hash I've ever had. The owner is a friendly guy and greets and make it a habit to talk to every customer."}
{"text":"Yes. As good as it gets... for diner food. 

This was my first venture here ever and it happened to be for my birthday brunch. My girlfriend chose it randomly and I'm glad she did, I mean a free cinnamon roll for birthday celebrators? Awesome! 

The cinnamon roll was ridiculous; the roll itself was insanely soft and melted in your mouth. The frosting was plentiful, but didn't overpower the cinnamon swirls. Truly a homemade dessert done right! 

My girlfriend and I shared breakfast; a California egg white omelets and a side of biscuits and gravy. The omelet was delicious, fluffy eggs and all the fixing's; Cheddar Jack Cheese, sausage, pico de gallo, sour cream, topped with avocado. This dish was huge and a perfect meal for sharing. 

The biscuits were, light, fluffy, and coated in a amazing white gravy. I would probably pour this gravy on pizza if I weren't afraid for my heart stopping shortly after. Ham, sausage, and maple syrup are the ingredients in the thick concoction and you definitely get every flavor in each bite, savory and salty. Amazing combo! 

There service here is stellar and my coffee cup was never empty. Mr. Mama, you have my heart."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at a great price. Had Mamas Short Stack. The pancakes were fluffy and tasty. The Chicken Fried Steak was delicious especially the gravy."}
{"text":"Worth every minute of the 10 minute drive from the strip! Huge portions, great coffee and phenomenal staff. Omelettes are 4 egg and buttermilk pancakes fill the entire plate! There is usually a wait, but it's well managed."}
{"text":"The service is always great!! I'm just not impressed by they're food. I had corned beef hash & there wasn't anything special about it. Just literally meat chopped into tiny pieces. The \"breakfast potato\" are cubed potatoes instead of shredded (hash browns), nothing added at all."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for Memorial Day weekend. After yelping a few breakfast spots we came across Mr. Mamas and I gotta say it was worth it. I highly recommend coming here, the staff is great, very friendly and attentive. The food is just AMAZING, you gotta try their cinnamon roll it is hot and fresh! Our waitress offered us a sample of their bacon, sausage and maple syrup gravy it was delicious. This place will definitely be our go to breakfast spot when in town!!"}
{"text":"A classic diner that I think is over-rated. The food is classic/traditional. The space is somewhat laid out like a cafeteria - very open. The staff is what makes this place stand out. They're so friendly and extremely nice. It's very rare to find a place in Vegas where the staff seem to actually like you. There was a man, perhaps the owner or manager, who was walking around greeting each table and making sure everything was good. He chat with a few of the tables. About the food, I got a Jenna wrap which is a tortilla wrapped around hard-cooked eggs, avocado, cilantro, jalapenos, sour cream, and salsa. It wasn't anything special at all, but it was enough to satisfy my hunger. I also ordered a pancake and that made me very happy."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is the best little place in town! It's so cute and the food is so good! You can't beat the price either! I definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Heard this was good and did not disappoint. Breakfast is fantastic, this place is a way from the strip and worth the wait. Come early as it it rather small and gets very crowded. Eggs Benedict hollandaise sauce was amazing. Come to this place a prepare to wait for awesome food"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast yesterday with my best friend.  Because of the amazing yelp reviews, we decided that it would be worth the 30+ minute wait to be seated. Boy, oh boy, was I wrong. The wait staff was pleasant for the most part and the atmosphere was a bit noisy - but what else can you expect from a place like this? I ordered biscuits and country gravy. Due to all the raves and reviews, I thought this would be my best bet. Again, wrong! The gravy was loaded with sausage, bacon, maple syrup...which sounded amazing when our waitress described the dish. However, it was mediocre at best. The gravy was lackluster and the biscuits were very dry and dense. It got a little better when I added a ton of salt to the gravy but not much. My best friend ordered a bacon avocado burger - in which the cook staff forgot to add the bacon. Our waitress realized that it was missing and brought out a fresh plate several minutes later. Our overall experience was not great. But hey, maybe I'll give it a second chance and order something completely different. Maybe."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Vegas to have breakfast.  I have been going for years now.  Food is great along with the service.  Friendly staff and the owner always checks with everyone to see if it meets satisfaction of one's love of food."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place has almost a 5 star rating - you'll ALWAYS get great service & great food.  Mr. Mamas is consistent and never disappoints - which is why we always eat here.  During peak hours there's a bit of a wait but again, people keep coming back for a reason!  In fact, I may regret writing this review which will bring more of ya'll here and only increase my wait time!"}
{"text":"The short line and wait is DEF WORTH IT. I really liked being treated by the owner, I really like his style and the place.. While in Vegas this is a short drive for amazing food. I recommend the Cali omlet and French toast with bacon.  Only because that's all we ate, can't wait for tomorrow's Steak and Egg plate."}
{"text":"Great place to head to for breakfast on the way out of Vegas -- or really, just for any reason.  Everything we ordered was top drawer; fresh, delicious, and hearty portions for very reasonable prices.   Staff is excellent too; they even open the door for you.  We're going to make this place our regular stop!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good prices and big portions that will leave you feeling happy and full!

I have been here twice and both times I saw the owner working and talking to customers. He always said thank you to customers for coming in and that he will see them next time. You don't get that kind of friendliness from owners now a days! 

PANCAKES!!! The pancakes here are huge. A stack of 3 is big enough to share among 2 or 3 people if everyone gets something else but still wants a taste. The pancakes are fluffy and never burnt or chewy. 

The first time I came here, the service I received was amazing. My coffee cup was always refilled and the girl working was friendly and always smiling. She checked up on us quiet often. My bf ordered the steak and eggs and the steak was very very thin. It was filling, but he mentioned that he wouldn't order steak and eggs from here again as there are other better and cheaper options on the strip. I ordered one pancake to share between the 2 of us, hash browns, 2 eggs, wheat toast and sausage. The sausage here are sausage patties so don't expect the regular sausage links. I prefer links so I didn't order the sausage the second time around. 

If you like hash browns... you MUST order it here! They are SUPER crispy. They list potatoes on the menu but potatoes = hash browns here, unlike other places where potatoes mean fried potato chunks. 

My sister ordered the chicken fried steak which came with 3 eggs, gravy, choice of toast and hash browns. It was huge. When we ordered this, our server asked us if we tried their gravy before and proceeded to list off a bunch of ingredients. Definitely not your traditional gravy. It was quite thick and very chunky. I did not like it but my sister did. 

If I'm starving and want a good, quick breakfast, I'll head on over to Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Mr. Mamas. So far everything was exceptional; the service, the food and, the location. 

We went here for Sunday brunch. It is to be expected that they were packed. The guy who took my name said it will be around 25-30 minutes wait. He was awesome at what he does by the way. He kept us updated the whole time and he explained to anyone who walks in that the time is just an estimate and that it is not guaranteed. When we were finally seated, our waitress Jasmine was really nice and attentive. My coffee cup was never close to being empty. The manager would also stop by to check on us and ask us if we need anything else. This place really knows how to make their customers feel at home. 

We ordered eggs Benedict, a pancake and an order of biscuits and gravy. It was nice of Jasmine to give us a heads up about their gravy.  Their gravy is not regular gravy. It has bacon bits and maple syrup in it. It sounded interesting so we gave it a try. It was so delicious! It was creamy and rich but not too heavy. The biscuits were crispy so it blends so perfectly with the creaminess of the gravy. The pancake was not dense and had a good texture. The benny was also amazing. The eggs were seasoned well and the bacon was cooked until it is crispy but not dry/hard. The hash browns were to die for! It was crispy on the exterior but was still soft and moist on the insides. 

I highly recommend this place. Good food and good price."}
{"text":"Since I had a visitor in Vegas, I might as well take them to go breakfast. I was getting out of UNLV and tried to search for a good local breakfast restaurant and found Mr. Mamas. The restaurant name may sound strange but the food is TO DIE FOR! 

As we drove into the shopping center on October 14, 2016, we thought no way the parking is full around Mr. Mamas. As we found a parking spot and went into the restaurant, there was the host/manager standing right next to the door ready to serve us in. As we sat at a table, our server was coming her way ready to order.

We ordered:
- Orange Juice
- French Toast
- Mamas Short Stack

We only waited about 6 minutes and the food was coming our way! When I first tried my short stack, I was SHOCKED! I've never seen pancakes so FLUFFY and so HUGE before! The taste of it was just so MOUTHWATERING, it just was so buttery. I also tried a little of the French Toast and it was GOOD also! As I next tried the ham, UMM! SO GOOD! The ham was soft to chew and had GOOD FLAVOR!

The service here was GOOD. It seems the manager and our server cares about their customers since they ask, \"How's the food?\" and \"How's the service?\"
This place is a good place to eat, much better than iHop. I RECOMMEND this place because the food comes out FRESH and QUICK especially in big portions! Also, they CARE about their customers' sarisfaction."}
{"text":"Looking for a breakfast joint off the strip? This place is your best option for those entering/leaving Vegas!

I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine and it got me the itis. Hashbrows were the right amount of crispiness. I find it unsatisfying when hash browns are soggy but these were on point! Ordered poached eggs over medium and the texture was so creamy and delicious. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful including the side of orange slices. 

Customer service was great! The staff was nice and quick to serve."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Breakfast restaurant for the family and came across Mr Mamas on Yelp. Great reviews hence we stopped for breakfast. We were greeted by Shawn who opened the door for us. That was amazing we thought. Claudia was our server. She was pleasant, polite, professional and answered questions that we asked. It was our first time there. We started off with the Cinnamon Bun. WOW! Delicious!. Breakfast that we ordered was YUMMY! Kat came to check on us to see if we needed anything. The customer service rendered by Claudia, Kat & Shawn was EXCELLENT! We will definitely be back again. Thank You again for making us feel SPECIAL!."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in Vegas. Would definitely recommend. Friendly staff, fast service, and inexpensive for great food. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the nicest servers I've ever met. I came here with a big group and there was a pretty long wait (good sign). We were seated pretty quickly though! We came in and they were so nice. It was my friend's birthday and they brought her out a free cinnamon roll. Even people that worked there that weren't serving us came up and wished her a happy birthday and asked how we were doing. The food was awesome too! I got an omelette and it was great. The potatoes were nice and crispy. Everything was really reasonably priced. If I lived in Las Vegas I would definitely be here every week!"}
{"text":"I had my breakfast last month and forgot to leave a review, as I promised. Pretty good omelets and fresh potatoes which were my favorite dish. I took a photo of my dish, but could not locate it, I guess I will have to go back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. You may have to wait a while but it will b worth it. Steady stream of business is usually a good sign. If you're in Vegas stop by. They only serve breakfast and lunch. I had the eggs and ham and my spouse had the Denver omelette... 4 eggs!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking to find a place for breakfast. I came across this place and noticed all the high reviews. This place was wonderful! Staff was super friendly and food was great! I had the banana caramel pancakes and they were delicious."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and quick and the place was well kept and clean.. However food was lacking quality! Biscuits were dry and gravy needed more seasoning. And be sure to check ingredient listing on menu as some omelettes don't come with cheese :(         
 Is an omelette without cheese really an omelette?"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but this place definitely deserves a 5 star review. As we approached the door we were greeted by the owner and he made us feel like we just walked into our family home. The service was fast and the workers were all friendly. The food was great as well and the price is unbeatable. Definitely will come back here ! Overall great experience."}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Vegas  we are looking for breakfast place and vg We didn't want to go to strip because it can get very pricey so after looking at the internet  we came  accross this place . And it's excellent , 5 star service , it's well managed, very clean , very friendly  service and clean . I will stop here again when we visit Vegas again .. Good job !! Keep it up."}
{"text":"I passed through here while I was leaving Las Vegas. I was looking for some good breakfast for a good price, I scored! The service was impeccable...My server was Julie and everyone else that walked by our table! They really work together here to make sure you never need to ask for anything. I ordered the special which was the ABC omelette. It had avocado, bacon, and choice of cheese, I chose pepper jack! It was really good. I got fruit instead of potatoes and I am happy I did! The fruit medley consisted of fresh strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, and honeydew. I also got a fresh, hot, buttery biscuit instead of toast. My breakfast was $9 and it came with coffee/ soft drink/ tea choice. I had coffee and it was good and fresh! 

Hubby ordered rib eye steak and eggs for $10! He got his with hashbrowns and a muffin and coffee of course!  He mentioned to Julie that we were travelling for 8 hours and she brought him a large take out cup for his coffee and filled it up!

Great service, great food, very clean  restaurant! I will definately be back here next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Well, if you want to have a breakfast or lunch somewhere away from the Strip, this is definitely the right place to go. They have a big selection for breakfast and lunch. They have pancakes, omelets, eggs, breakfast wraps, sandwiches, soups, salads and beverages , of course... 
I found this place on Yelp and read the good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. 
After trying I can say that there is nothing special or spectacular about this place. Prices are reasonable, of course, but the food was not perfect or exciting as I expected.  I tried the Western omelet with mushrooms, sausage, green peppers and onions. Well, not bad, but something was missing for me that even Tabasco sauce wasn't able to fulfill.  
Overall ,not bad. Will give it another try..."}
{"text":"Been half dozen times, to me 4-4.5 star. I think it is over hyped but I like this place a lot so rating little high myself. 

I'm pretty sure I can update this review to 5 stars later because the managers care, read the reviews, respond, and hopefully will try to improve. 

The service is great, 5 stars! You're quickly seated and brought drinks. Take orders real fast and come back around to check in and offer ice tea refills often. The owner/s seem like great people from the little we've spoke. They're always working, when owners are there often and care the business does good! The owners opened the door for me with smiles and hand shakes today. The server came around often, tended to few special requests, nice and interactive, and been their years. Even the cashier lady asked how I was mid meal 2 of the visits at least. It's very great to see they train all employees to work together. 

Overall the food is pretty good but left much to be desired sadly to say. After reading the reviews you just expect more of a wow factor.

They're good about cooking eggs just how you ask and special requests are nicely addressed. 

Food has good presentation and just right portions so you do not need to get to go containers often, nothing real huge and wasteful which I like. 

Ice tea is perfect. 5 star

Biggest problem is the soup, never changes and is so boring and confusing. Chicken noodle is just okay, could be way better. The other soup is just a broth, no tiny chunks even! It's tasty and could be good if they added stuff to chew on, changed them daily, made fresh with lots of care. This would be an easy important fix. 2 star

I think most of the menu is overall bland and could be improved. I hope they will take these criticism and actually do that maybe so I'm being picky in thorough. The menu has only simple offerings with not enough flavor, take more shots and try to truly earn the hype. 

Potatoes were okay but for the hype you'd expect fresh cut amazing with lots of extra flavor but they charge .50c more to get tiny amount of onions and peppers tossed over the average home fries. I've had so many amazing breakfast taters that I know they could improve this easy and hope they do. 2 star

Benedict was cooked good and muffin was soft and easy to cut but could be bit better. Sauce was little odd and came with too much, thankfully they have their own plate so it doesn't get on other things. It was pretty good, cooked well, olives were good, but with little touch up it could be better and earn the hype. 4.2 star

Breakfast burrito was small and didn't come with potatoes I believe, maybe they changed it but if not they need to. They give little too much potatoes in other meals but none on the side on the burrito because it has them in the burrito. It's already small, this is not good value and not worth the hype. 2.5 stars

So to recap I'd say service is 5 star, but food is a frustrating 3 at best.

Managers willingness to be there to work means they're likely to improve. They'll read and respond to this review which is great to see. Problem is they don't need too improve so worried they won't. I mean they haven't for years, same soup and menu, boring decor. Had the soup been changed today or potatoes I'd of have 5 star but no changes. Please take a shot mamas and truly try to earn the hype and a real 5 star! I'd love to update the review and will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas from Sedona Arizona. We chose Mr. Mama's based solely on the name. The food was excellent and the service was great. I asked for well done bacon and they got it right!"}

Food good sized portions, quality and good service.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time here and love the food here . Our new favorite spot and Denise was awesome . Gave us the recommendations of what to try and we loved it . Will be our new breakfast spot from now on A+++++ thanks  Denise !"}
{"text":"This place is the best place in Vegas to eat breakfast! I found it on Yelp 2 years ago, when I was in town for a convention. Always have to come here when I am in town. Food is excellent and the owner is really friendly and greets everyone. Come here and support a hard working family."}
{"text":"The customer service here was EXCEPTIONAL!!! The coffee was really good just wish they'd had stevia as a sweetener option. The food was good but my medium-well steak was very overcooked. My bf's Mama burger was AMAZING! He can EAT but still had leftovers!!! We will definitely be back even though they are far from home. The welcoming atmosphere more than makes up for overcooked beef."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas breakfast is a staple and can be found for ALL DAY DINING just about anywhere you look. But not everyone can do it up quite like Mr Mamas can.  This is the perfect divey breakfast spot located off the strip , in a strip mall, where locals and visitors-in-the-know go to eat. Wait time is slight but front of the house has got it skillfully covered as they move tables, and people, to get you in, feed, and out the door in a timely manner. They offer all your basics that you'll want to see on an all day breakfast menu and skip the upscale and fancy touches. This is basic corn beef hash that's grated not shredded. Big egg omelets with the WHITE and YELLOW parts. Get my drift? Come on in, grab a seat and chow down!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a family feel along with the customer service received, Jaqueline was awesome and made a few suggestions to make our meal more satisfying! I will be back! If you're from Hawaii and you've been to boots and kimo's, this is along the lines of that kind of restaurant and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Been to Mr. Mamas before the move, first time at new location. Way bigger and more spacious than original location. Food was great again. The burger I had needed some seasoning but cooked well. The breakfast food my family got was all tasty. 

Staff is wonderful as always. Next time I am ordering a breakfast meal. Love the new spot will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with the hubby and it was very tasty! There was a bit of a wait once we got there but we were seated fairly quickly! Service was prompt and our server was very nice! I had the Mama's sandwich with turkey and bacon, and hubby had the corn beef hash with eggs! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is the kinda place you become a regular at very quickly. The owner runs around shaking hands and greeting everybody. It's like a mom and pop's Cheers! It doesn't hurt that the food is good and cost is low. I will be back for the top notch service and home town feel!"}
{"text":"Be prepared. Get a good night's rest. If at all possible, eat a really light dinner the night before you plan on going here for breakfast! You will thank me....if they sell gift cards from Mr Momma's, I will take it!  LoL! HUGE portions! 
The food, the service, the staff...stellar! You have to try the pancakes! Let me go on, and on, and on. They are thick yet light and ya know how thick pancakes fall apart and become moosh as soon as the syrup hits them? Yah, these don't! They are delicious and HUGE!
Also, you gotta try the sausage gravy! They make it with sausage AND bacon with a touch of maple syrup! I could actually eat cauliflower if it had that heavy on it! 
Staff was amazing (Hi Kat!), I had never been there yet I felt as though we were regulars! I will definitely make a point to come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and WOW! Phenomenal food excellent service had the Denver omelet fantastic great coffee too!"}
{"text":"I arrived about 9 am and it was pretty quiet-at 9:30 this place was bustling. 
The staff is friendly and attentive. 
Food came quickly after ordering. I had steak and eggs-my last meat for awhile. Although the steak was thin it was cooked medium rare as I requested. Hash browns were better than most places - brown and crispy outside and soft but not over cooked inside. Coffee was decent and the vanilla creamer raised the flavor level. Prices are very good and servings are more than adequate. 
The dining room is spacious and would accommodate a small group breakfast easily. 
I'll return soon and try the pancakes-they look delicious. 

I returned to try the pancakes. They did not disappoint-they were large, very light, fluffy, tasty and a beautiful golden brown.  So good."}
{"text":"We stopped for brunch and got pancakes and eggs Benedict Florentine. I wasn't very impressed with their eggs Benedict, I have definitely had better ones. Their hashbrowns was a tad bit too oily. I wouldn't recommend if you're a vegetarian and looking for just egg options."}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff was amazing. Food was delicious!  Place was jumping too, great place to eat"}
{"text":"GREAT customer service! Ate here with husband at 10:30 on Easter Monday. Warning! Pancakes are huge...diameter and thickness! Order conservatively! There seemed to be a great deal of care put into the operation!"}
{"text":"Overall pleasant experience. The owner greeted us when walked in the door and made us feel welcomed. Our waitress was Melissa, excellent customer service. She impressed me with how well she knew the menu and was able to customized meals to our liking. I had the western omelette with cheddar jack cheese and hash brown. It was so delicious, I would recommend it. The hash brown was crispy and just right. Overall , great food and pleasing experience."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food and i was extremely excited to try this place after reading previous reviews. I will say the service was amazing and the staff is super nice and attentive, they had one major pitfall for me...their country gravy. A friend and I split a bunch of stuff and I just wasn't as impressed as I expected to be. Their breakfast sandwich was good and so were their potatoes. Their chicken noodle soup was a bit salty. But it was really the country gravy I was most disappointed in. I like to consider myself somewhat of a gravy expert and there was just no flavor to it. Definitely very meaty, which I could appreciate, but sill lackluster in seasoning. I definitely was not dazzled."}
{"text":"February 28th 2017 

The wait on a Tuesday at noon was not bad considering it was lunch hour, we were seated immediately.  When I have a comfort food craving we just head down to the best cozy breakfast spot in town.

I normally don't change my mind on menu options. I always go for the French toast.  I thumbed through the menu to see the favorites listed.  I went with the breakfast burrito with bacon.  It had green and red peppers, onions, scrambled eggs and potatoes.  Definitely my new favorite!  It reminds me of home fries from Rhode Island.

Sometimes the wait can be 45 minutes to an hour on weekends. Get here before your hunger strikes! By the time you have a table you will be hungry if you aren't already."}
{"text":"Solid down-to-home breakfast place. The food is rich, flavorful and thoroughly satisfying. The staff is friendly and interior clean with nice-enough decor."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! The owner was fantastic, greeted and welcomed you to his restaurant. Had a great conversation with my husband and I. My husband ordered the Greek omelet and I had the Spanish omelet and both of them were delicious. Never had to ask for a refill of coffee or water, the ladies were walking each table consistently. On our way out the owner thanked us and shook our hands . Great advice and food, we will be back when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good and reasonably priced.  Portions were big and service was quick!  The owner of the restaurant was out walking around to all the tables and speaking to the customers, which I thought was cool!  It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty brunch and the food is just awesome. If you're in Vegas don't waste your money in brunch buffet. This place is better.

Two minor issues to keep in mind. The wait is ridiculously long, something similar to the line outside good Vegas buffets. The parking can be hard. Common sense for good restaurants."}
{"text":"Worth the wait for a delicious brunch of omelette, hash  browns, sour dough toast and pancakes. Fast service with a smile and very attentive."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!  I love breakfast food and wanted to go to a good place that had reasonable prices and this was the perfect place.  As soon. As we arrived a staff member opened the door for us and we were seated immediately. There were two gentlemen waiting at the table,  one even pulled or the chair for me and got us or drink orders right away.  Or server came by shortly after and took our food orders. Was nice to have staff come by randomly ask if we were ok and refilled our drinks.  Food came out quick,  one of the team members climbed on a chair to take a group photo of us and our food.  Finally the food, i had the chicken fried steak with a sausage gravy l, came with 3 eggs,  choice of toast and potato. Cost 10 and some change, for the amount of food you get it was a great price! Was delicious and probably one of the best fried steaks I've had.  My boyfriend had the steak and eggs was cooked just how he asked for it and was also tasty. I would recommend this place especially for people from out of town."}
{"text":"Excellent! We were starving...well I was and we walked away so satisfied. 

The place was packed but wait was no more than 15 minutes. Everyone was courteous, the food was delish and the ambiance was nice. If we lived in the city we would come back. 

Very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"Walking up i knew this place wouldn't let me and my mini me (daughter) down. Approaching the tinted windows to my surprise a handsome bald guy with a very pleasant aura opened the door to let the lady in!! Yesss, mr mamas is packed with eye candy hunny... with all due respect of course! The decor simple 50s diner vibes.  Very busy, in this case a good sign,  never have enjoyed brunch with a side of crickets.  As for the food we ordered ribeye and eggs, hash with peppers and onions, French toast,  and bacon.  With the best first French toast was totally my favorite.  Really well executed and delicious,  eggs cooked a bit under what id desired as was the steak over. For the worst.... which really isn't so bad my hash browns. You know how some restaurants hash is sort of like hash on the outside but mash on the inside? Yes thats what those were. It was not enough to make me change my mind about the awesomeness of this place though.  Id still highly recommend it to anyone.  Cant wait to come back and  try more!"}
{"text":"If I'm in a laid back, chill kind of mood, I'm going to Mr. Mama's. Breakfast comfort food in a relaxed, unpretentious environment. The kind of place you need to be ready to eat though. The portions are HUGE. My must have at Mr. Mama's is the chicken fried steak. Did I mention the HUGE portions? Eggs scrambled over easy with extra sausage gravy, please. The service is just alright"}
{"text":"Service is Great! Food is Delicious! Try the Chicken Fried steak and Eggs with Hash Browns extra crispy! YUM! :)"}
{"text":"First experience and certainly won't be my last.  The owner greets/seats you upon arrival which is a nice touch and unheard of in any chain establishment.  They offer a good selection of homey breakfast foods as well as burgers, salads and sandwiches. Funny enough, I came for the cinnamon roll and it certainly didn't disappoint!  

Staff was friendly and attentive, food was good and decently priced making this a neighborhood joint that I can enjoy a breakfast at anytime!"}
{"text":"Good and the kinda bad - This place is only a couple of minutes from my house. I don't know why I didn't try it sooner. Breakfast - chicken fried steak and eggs. VERY good. They make it themselves -- most other places use frozen chicken fried steak. Two of my favorites are Black Bear Diner and Peggy Sue's (I-15 just north of Barstow). This is right up there. Service is fantastic and friendly. My 2nd visit was for lunch. Had the tuna melt. There are three primary food items I judge a restaurant by - chicken fried steak; meatloaf; tuna melt. I was a disappointed in this one primarily because the tuna was very cool (almost cold in places). By definition, a tuna \"melt\" should be at least very warm, if not hot. I don't expect 'cool' tuna when I bite into a melt. The cheese wasn't as melted as it should have been. Granted, the tuna itself was excellent, but I didn't order a cold tuna sandwich. This is so basic that even I could make a decent acceptable one. IF it had been hot (or at least warm) I would likely have given 5 stars. It just barely makes 4 because, as picky as it might sound, I expect my tuna 'melt' to be hot enough to 'melt' the cheese."}
{"text":"First time here ... Had to send the bowl of chili back .. It was cold

I'm a biscuits  and gravy fan ..these were bland 

The burger was  good. 

Slow service 


I won't return"}
{"text":"Food was good, no complaints there. Pancakes are ginormous, so you probably need just one. Sausage patties are pretty hefty and good too. Went on a late Sunday morning and there was a bit of a wait. We ended up taking an oddly placed table by the door that no one wanted, not the best choice if someone decides to hold the door open and let the January chill in. Overall a good place that I'll return to when I visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible breakfast and lunch. Awesome service for our party of 8. I will be here every time I visit. Mr. Mamas came over and checked on us. You can tell he's a humble man. We were blessed to be there!"}
{"text":"Great way to spend a birthday amazing service and food!! Highly recommended!!!  Received a cinnamon roll as a birthday gift!!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my buddy from SD.  They were recommended to him as a place to try in Vegas by fellow Yelpers.  They are Yelp friendly and we got a free drink for checking in.  The service was friendly and attentive.  I had the chicken friend steak and eggs with gravy.  The waitress let me try their unique gravy to ensure I would like it.  It has ground sausage, bacon and a hint of maple.  I thought I would like it but was pleasantly supposed at how tasty it was.  
   The chicken fried steak was a ground patty with a lightly spiced flour coating.  It came perfectly cooked and was crisp and not oily.  The oil had to have been at the perfect temperature and fresh.  The gravy on top was plentiful and made the dish a treat.  The eggs were prefect over easy and just the way I like them.  I love hash browns and their were homemade and very good.  They lightly salt so had to add some but understand that not everybody loves salt like I do.  Great place to start your day as they know how to do a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"We came here after reading such positive reviews. The Food was awesome and the staff working was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We will be back."}
{"text":"5 Stars for excellent service- constant coffee refills, quick to be seated & nice wait staff & owner. Unfortunately the food itself is a miss (although huge portions)! Very average stuff, good for mass production I suppose. We expected better considering the high ratings on here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been here twice now and both times the food has been amazing. I've had omelette a both times and they're the best I've ever had. The cinnamon rolls are a must have! My husband has had the burgers and they are also very good.  Chicken fried steak was to die for with the sausage gravy being so darn good! I'm running out of adjectives for telling you how good this place is!! I'm a local and will take everyone who visits us here! Love love love!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great, service is even better, amazing to be exact! I don't typically write reviews however, I Highly recommend this little gem. Also, Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We wanted brunch on the last day of our visit in Vegas and came across this place on yelp. First impression- over 200 something reviews, averaging 5 stars??! Gotta check this place out! 

Customer services: A+ ( all servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Constantly checking in to see if you need your coffee refills or need anything at all. Working in the servicing industry myself, I am definitely big on customer service and satisfaction and I give the whole serving crew including the owner a 5 Stars. 

Food: A ( ordered the French toast with 2 eggs, the egg Benedict with hash brown , and the Marty wrap plus 2 coffees. Food is great! It's traditional American breakfast and I say the food is actually better than some fancy restaurant that serves brunch that I have been to in LA. It's not the best I have ever had but I would say it's better than a lot of places for friction of the price. Coffee is good by the way. 

Setting: B (Danny's - like setting or regular mom and pop shop. Definitely not a fancy brunch place but rather a family friendly setting and the food is pretty good. )

Price: A ( it's pretty cheap compare to places in LA ! And I purchased the $15 for $30 deal on Yelp when I came to this place so it's definitely a steal! For all that food and coffee that we ordered , our total bill came out to be less than $30 even! And of course I have actually only paid $15 for all that because of the Yelp deal. So it's a Win!!! But make sure you tip on the full price and more because these people deserve it! 

Overall: A = 5 Star from me. I agree with rest of the yelp reviews that it is a great place. Will recommend and come again!"}
{"text":"Get away from the strip and come have breakfast at Mr Mamas. Great food and super friendly service.
They are doing something right at this place, everyone is super friendly and make you feel very welcome.
There was a little bit of wait on a Wednesday but it was well worth it. I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and it was very good. Our son in law said that was the best gravy he had ever had.
Very reasonably priced also."}
{"text":"Want to get away from the sleaziness and money grabbing expense of the Vegas Strip? Come on over here with your family and enjoy the personalized attention, excellent food and reasonable prices. 
There are no slot machines or anything to remind you of where you are, just a few banners from local sport teams. It's worth the drive to get away from the mayhem."}
{"text":"The food here was really good. Overall my pancakes were fluffy as a cloud and as good as heaven.  I give it 5 stars because the service here with Alex was amazing and the chicken steak,pancakes, and French toast was amazing. The only food item that was not so tasty was the biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would. This place was fantastic. Superb service! The omelets were great and not greasy. All the other food looked really good. Will definitely recommend and come back next time we're in town"}
{"text":"Excellent service at reasonable prices! Very friendly and welcoming staff. We have visit this location each time we have come to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is definitely a gem amongst Breakfast restaurants. The wait was a little long, but well worth it. The manager Kat was welcoming & friendly. These are the best hashbrowns I've had in ages. The portions were a decent size & I could barely finish my food. Also, everything was SEASONED to perfection. We will definitely be back when we come to town."}
{"text":"My husband took me here to eat breakfast for my birthday today after reading good reviews about it.  What a disappointment.  Our food came out cold and his medium rare steak was cooked well done.  Also, the fluffy pancakes he had read about were extremely heavy.  It might not have been so bad had our food come out hot or even warm.  But there is nothing worse than getting food that you can tell has been sitting for quite some time.  We definitely won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"We had heard about Mr. Mama's so when my husband suggested a breakfast out today, we aimed for 7:15am. 
Good thing we did as the place was hopping and it filled up before you could say Blackberry Specials!!! We loved the fluffy buttermilk pancakes which nestled the fresh blackberries and butter on top. Eggs were perfect. I heard the sausages were nice- but they disappeared so fast I had to take my husband's word.
Coffee was good and plentiful as was the service.
Mr. Mama came around to say hello which is a welcome touch. 
Definitely enjoy the old school clean breakfast cafe ambience with warm welcomes to match!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a few miles from the strip,  but SO WORTH IT. The food was wonderful (I had the Philly Cheese steak omelet), the coffee was great with free refills, and the staff was attentive. On top of that,  the owner,  Nick,  was wonderful. He found out we were in town for a bachelor party and had the staff bring us free cinnamon rolls. They also called fans for us after to arrange our travel back to the hotel. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. I had the Greek omelette w biscuit and gravy instead of toast. Large servings. The home made gravy was excellent. Home fries were run of the mill, no bad but pretty plain. Good coffee. Friendly, fast service. The reason for 4 stars is because of the atmosphere. It was just an open room w tables. Cute decorations but nothing special. The food was excellent so I'd certainly recommend and return there."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever, but so worth it!! After reading the reviews I had to come here and see how great this place is. 

Our service was excellent. Even though the place was full capacity, our drinks were always full, and plenty of times someone came by to make sure everything was good. 

We ordered biscuits and gravy, a side of ham, an omelet, and French toast. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were excited to grab brunch after our Vegas trip so we decided to come to Mamas because of the good reviews. We were told the wait was 20 minutes but they got us seated in about 10. I ordered the Cali omelette which had sour cream, avocado, and pico de Gallo. My friends also got biscuits and gravy, cinnamon bun, and the Western omelette. The omelettes that we got were very bland so they needed a bit more salt or seasoning. My other friends did not like the taste of the gravy either. However, the home fries, toast, and cinnamon bun were very good! Maybe we came on an off day but we are likely not coming back if we go to Vegas again after such a disappointing brunch :("}
{"text":"Update: Dad LOVED Mr Mamas! They gave dads chocolate bars for Father's Day and mine was absolutely thrilled about it. He said that the small gift and happy Father's Day wish was a genuinely kind gesture that shows they're personal and caring towards customers, setting a business like this aside from others that offer Father's Day promos simply to bring in business and holds a much greater value than any discount or deal. 

He was just as pleased with the service, food, and homey atmosphere of the restaurant. I was telling him how great it is that the place is so heavily staffed compared to the restaurant I work in, which is much larger and busier. He pointed out that well-staffed restaurants, especially small businesses, are hard to come by and make the overall experience so much better because it doesn't end up compromising any of aspect of service."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!! That's all I can say! I am not a potato fan at all but this place has the absolutely best perfectly made home fries! 

There pancake is real big and fluffy, so rich and delicious, buttery combination melting in your mouth.

I had the western omelette with avocado and mozzarella cheese, everything was so delicious I had to take seconds for the drive back home."}
{"text":"First time visiting Mr Mamas. Found them on yelp and saw all the five star reviews. The service was definitely 5 star. We were seated right away and our drink order taking immediately. I ordered the California omelette wit potatoes and substituted my toast for a pancake. I just want to say who lets you do that? It's always an extra charge. The food was delicious especially the pancake. The waitress was friendly and checked on us often. One of my new favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great wait staff. Corned beef hash was delicious! Owner chatted with everyone and was making sure everyone that walked in got addressed immediately. Not a new place but new location... Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great down home breakfast place. Servers were all very friendly with smiles all around. Food was really good. The eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked and the sauce was awesome.The corned beef was delicious,almost all meat not a lot of potato filler!"}
{"text":"Make sure you get here early to avoid the wait! (Though it's worth the wait)

I've been here twice with my girlfriend, this place has not come close to disappointing us.  Both times we were greeted and served by very helpful people at the restaurant.  There's even a nice gentleman who walks around and asks if you'd like him to take a photo for you (with your own cell phone).  The second time we went here we got seated in a corner behind the cash register.. and even then we still got excellent service!

Now to the food.. the home fries are delicious!  If your food comes with an option of hash browns or home fries, get the home fries!  They are so good.. lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with some sort of seasoning that makes it taste delicious.  I ordered my usual steak and eggs and my girlfriend ordered her eggs benedict.  Everything was on point.  My steak had so much flavor from the outer edges all the way to the center.  My girlfriend's eggs benedict was savory in every bite.  

I'm only disappointed that we couldn't bring any leftovers home.. because we ate it all!

We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"My mushroom omelette was fantastic! Loved this place, and I am from Chicago where you know good food!"}
{"text":"Good homemade breakfast in town hands down.  Good prices for big breakfast.  Pancakes as big as your face.  They are light, fluffy, and delicious.  The rest of the people agreed and was so full afterwards, no room for cinnamon rolls either, but they looked divine!  

The day we went, was take your kids to work day, so we had some extra hands on the table helping with waters and coffees.  It was so cute.  They were all so helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent plus friendly service and food was great. Good portions and never had to wait long for anything. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Polite and very hospitable atmosphere. The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive. Food was plentiful and not pricey. A definite gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious meal and great portion for what you pay for. I eat here 2 to 3 times a month and always love the hospitality, Texas toast, and the environment."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food. Excellent customer service. I was greeted at the door and felt very welcomed. Very pleased with this restaurant. Recommended."}
{"text":"We were in town for a College Softball tournament at UNLV, heard about this place and even though we were tight on time, we woke up early to come out here.  Did not disappoint!  Everything was amazing.  The owner comes around to the tables and personally greets you, amazing service, amazing food and an amazing prices.  

We will be back before we leave town and we will be back any time we come back in town."}
{"text":"I wish I would have tried this spot sooner!  We came in for a late breakfast and we waited about 10 minutes.  The menu has a great variety and something for everyone.  My boyfriend got the country fried steak and I got the eggs with bacon and hashbrowns. 

The food was great and the coffee kept coming (my fave!), even though I wasn't obsessed with the taste of it.  Our server was SO kind.  I would hire her in a heartbeat.  She would overhear our conversation and chime in, which some people may think is annoying, but I just thought she was so sweet and caring!  She made the most motivational comments and was just an uplifting positive person.  The owner/manager?  talked to us a few times and was very friendly.  He asked if we would like a photo which was thoughtful even though we declined.

If you're in the area and want a great casual breakfast/brunch experience I would highly recommend Mr Mamas!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time. I've gotten an omelet every time and it's delicious. The service is always great with a friendly staff and fast orders on the food. A good classic breakfast place with tasty and solid dishes."}
{"text":"First time here today and was blown away with the friendly service and delicious food! Very attentive service from start to finish and very accommodating since we had little ones. We had the chicken fried steak with gravy and eggs, corned beef hash, and eggs and bacon for our twin toddlers. Everything was cooked exactly right. We love breakfast/brunch and have been around to many restaurants and this one is one of the best!!"}
{"text":"Love the new location! I'm so happy that you have grown, without compromising your service and quality!   I'll continue to be a loyal customer every time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is extremely welcoming! The owner opened the door for us and asked our seating preference. All the staff seemed very friendly and we were checked on regularly. I had the breakfast sandwich with sausage patty and provolone cheese and it was great. The hash browns that it came with were phenomenal! Overall a really good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service.. a guy server also gave my one year old son crackers while we wait for our food.. i love this place so much"}
{"text":"My second time here and I will be back every time I am in Vegas.  Great service, excellent food and coffee.  Highly recommended to anyone who wants to get away from the strip buffets."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I work at a timeshare down the street and am constantly recommending guests to come here, even though I've never been. Today was my first time and I will definitely be back. Lourdes (our server) was very sweet and patient- she even gave us a free cinnamon roll. I will continue to give my praise to this restaurant and hopefully I'll come back very soon. Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"We were waited on by no less than 4 servers while we were there, and the owner made an appoint to even stop by our table. Service is absolutely top notch! Everyone offered to refill our coffee, tea, water, etc. Get the home fries - yum!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's popped up on my yelp during a recent family trip to Las Vegas. It was our last day there and we were looking for a family friendly breakfast spot, with good prices,  off the strip. So happy we found this place. 

We walked right in and got sat at a table quickly. I ordered coffee and water and a Denver omelette with fried potatoes. This plate was huge! I could only get halfway through it, but it was good. I also ordered my girls the 2 pancakes, bacon and egg plate to split. Again,  another large portion (not complaining at all), I got to eat some of their pancakes and, they too, tasted so good!!! My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and was very happy with it as well.

Employees were all very friendly, and efficient. I think we even met the owner who stopped by our table to chat for a second. 

Overall, good homestyle eating and great prices for the plates you're served. I'd come back again for sure! Children's menus would be a great addition, mine always love to color, but we got by as well. 

Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"We came here after researching yelp breakfast reviews. The place was packed and had to wait for a table. The food was ok but not exceptional. The staff was friendly. I don't think i will return."}
{"text":"This place was very busy on Saturday but we'll worth the wait. The staff was very professional and courteous. Always refilling our coffee and drinks. The food was also excellent, I recommend this place I'd you ever in Vegas"}
{"text":"Loved it. The taste was excellent. Quantity was a lot. More than we could eat.
We ordered Eggs Benedict, omlettes and pancakes. Eggs were well made. Hash browns with peppers and onions was delicious. Best I had.
Wanted to add that the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious - traditional breakfast fare done very, very well!

Get the EGGS BENEDICT!  Such a simple dish but they put a lot of care into everything and you can taste the quality in the food.  I got eggs benedict w/ bacon, which was perfect.  The home fries w/ peppers and onions were delicious.  We also got pancakes, which were soooo fluffy and thick!   There's nothing fancy on the menu, just high-quality, delicious food.  Portions are huge!

The place was very busy when we got there but only had to wait about 5 minutes before being seated.  The service was outstanding, they were constantly refilling our coffee and water.  Very friendly and helpful!

Tried this place for the first time last Saturday morning for breakfast, it's a bit off the strip but well worth the short Uber ride.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here twice while vacationing in Vegas and was pleased. Good food, good people, and good service. The entire staff was friendly, attentive, and nice. I will definitely be returning here on my next trip. Mr. Mama treats his customers right."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfasts! They moved to a new location on Jones. Much bigger, brighter and nicer. My all-time favorite breakfast place in Vegas! Get the Greek omelette...yum! Love the pancakes and hash browns too. Good quality bacon cooked right. Super nice owner and welcoming, friendly servers."}
{"text":"First time was great. Owner helped us and food was good. Second time exact opposite. Coming off knee and back surgery, gave host our name and sat in the car for 20 minutes. Went in to see if it was time and he told us he called our name, didn't see us, so back of the line. Keep in mind he took our make while we were sitting in the car. Your staff is a reflection of you. This guy doesn't make you look good."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas has been serving the Vegas community for years on the Decatur side, until their semi-recent expansion to this part of town in the good ol Spanish Palms retail plaza (aka strip mall palooza). They haven't lost a beat with their newer surroundings, as they serve some of the best breakfast in the city while providing incredible service all at the same time.

Their new spot is one giant dining room space; complete with the retro black and white checkered floor tile (#1) and a number of tables for all groups and sizes. There is a TV playing in the corner for the morning crowd and the staff is usually warmly greeting folks as they come in and leave. The hustle and bustle in the back kitchen becomes hard to ignore; a subtle reminder for what most people (and I) are here to eat.

Their menu is practically exclusive to the quintessential American breakfast experience while featuring a decent number of other diner classics such as salads, sandwiches, and soups. I've been a sucker for hashbrowns and theirs is as good as any. Perfectly crispy, aromatic, and extremely complementary to any additional breakfast item. My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself. Everything was so delicious, I was secretly cursing at myself knowing nothing like this exists where I live.

I took my time, polished off a glass of orange juice and just marveled how simple and wonderful these foods are. Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.

A huge shout out to the owners / management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits. On the front of their menu there is a (extremely cheesy) quote that reads: \"Our Place Will Put A Smile On Your Face.\" Truth.

Review #3100 is in the books. To 5 stars and many more adventures in hashbrowns.

{"text":"This is a great little place that specializes in breakfast and lunch. My best friend brought me here one morning after a long night out on the strip. We both ordered omelettes, hashbrowns, toast and my friend ordered an extra side of biscuits and gravy with his. The only downside is that we didn't care for their country gravy, it was really plain and dry tasting, unfortunately. Otherwise the food was delicious! My chili omelette was really good! The chili was perfect, not too spicy, served fresh and it had a delicious taste to it. The hashbrowns were amazing, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sourdough toast was big, soft & fluffy. The coffee was hot, fresh and good---i enjoyed mine with some French vanilla creamer and sugar. Yum! The staff and service was fast, friendly and awesome. Our wait time for food was just about 10 minutes total. Finally, the prices are very reasonable. In my opinion, it was well worth the $12 Uber ride from the strip to receive a quality breakfast and reasonably priced breakfast. On the strip you'll pay $5 just for a single cup of coffee! I will definitely be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and clean. Very welcoming staff and they keep checking to see if you need anything. I love it and I would go back any day to eat."}
{"text":"We come here every time we go to Las Vegas. On this trip, I was disappointed at the anemic, small portion of corned beef hash for over $11. Just normal and did not taste home made as it claimed. French toast was ok and fluffy. Just average for this trip, Thanksgiving 2017."}
{"text":"Like the new location but it's still too small for the number of customers. They should have kept the old place open in addition to opening this place. 30 min wait. Great food for great price though."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, warm, welcoming, friendly owner, good looking waitresses, definitely my choice for breakfast in Las Vegas. 6-Star"}
{"text":"Fricken awesome. The food is great. The service is impeccable. An atmosphere that'll keep me coming back every time I'm in Vegas. This place is lightyears ahead of many others. A must. Thank you so much guys. & shout out to my chicken fried steak every time"}
{"text":"I normally like to wait until I've visited an establishment a few times before leaving a review but this place warrants an exception.

Background: I came here with a friend who is supremely picky but raved about the food. I set my expectations low but was totally blown away.

Atmosphere: the vibe in this place is very down home, down-to-earth, no fuss, no frills. It's simply (if somewhat sparsely) decorated and most of the tables are pretty much the same faux stone and wooden edged two-and-four-tops with pull out chairs.

Food: everything is generously sized, delicious and homemade. The pancakes are the size of dinner plates and the option of fresh fruit or chocolate chips. The biscuits and gravy were fantastic. With sausage gravy, it's easy to make it too heavy but this wasn't overwhelming. The home fries didn't come out of a bag and the hashbrowns with peppers, cheese, and gravy was a pretty inventive combination that sounds weird on paper but was actually great.

Service: our waitress Crystal was fantastic and rolled with it when we asked to split three different dishes. She was friendly and attentive and very personable. The manager, Cat, was also super great and friendly with everyone.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't understand the name, but when you have food this good who cares about a name. Service was fast, friendly, and attentive. Food is great. Good variety on menu. Will be back to this place for sure. Stopped in on a Monday at 10:15 and the place was packed. But they are quick to get your food out."}
{"text":"I have found the greatest spot for breakfast. Portions are very good and the flavor is great. Staff is very attentative and friendly."}
{"text":"Yeah.  Come to Vegas. F$&& the buffet.  Come to Mr Mamas!!!!! 

Better food. Better prices. Better feelings!!!!

Just Better!!!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on Yelp, took 15 minutes from the strip - best breakfast in Vegas, period. This will be our new spot when in town. Friendly, amazing service and food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's is a solid diner-type restaurant, but I do not understand the huge hype of this place.  

I came at about noon on a saturday and the wait was 30 minutes.  The food was as expected: eggs, pancakes, french toast, sandwiches, etc.  The people I came with had an omelette and french toast and I had a pastrami sandwich.  All was good, but none truly exceeded any expectations, more they underwhelmed them because of all the rave reviews.

This place is cheap and I would assume pretty consistent for breakfast but I don't think it beats out other Las Vegas similarities such as Egg & I."}
{"text":"Simply: breakfast perfection!

Service - perfect
Food - perfect
Value - perfect
Speed - perfect
Atmosphere - excellent

My 13 year old son and I were ecstatic about the whole experience."}
{"text":"I have to admit the menu said it all......Portion control Mr Mama.... learn it... lol.... I am trying to find something bad to say about this experience....blank here.... omg  breakfast was over the top and portions with it....clean, friendly staff, efficient, but the food  is like I prepare in my own kitchen ... good and plenty full portion.... no one leaves hungry and all have a smile leaving.... btw portions so large I.. yes myself did NOT finish my own plate... this is very rare.... VERY.....Kudos and a 4.99999"}
{"text":"The best pancakes I've ever had. Whenever I order pancakes, I'm always let down by the time I get to the half-way point; pancake gets so soggy from the syrup. Not so at Mr. Mamas. Even drenched in syrup the amazing discs are still as fluffy as the first bite. Service was attentive, and Mr. Mama himself is there to make sure breakfast goes smoothly. The prices are extremely reasonable as well. Well done!

10/10 recommend this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast was so good we returned for lunch the next day.

Pros:
Service was prompt, friendly and the right amount of attentiveness both visits.
PERFECTLY seasoned hash browns and steak! Would return for that alone.  
Fluffy yummy pancakes the size of your plate.  1 is plenty!  
Large portions. 
Onion rings were also good.

Negatives:  
None!

We weren't as excited about our lunch items as we were our breakfast.  Had hot pastrami and a taco salad.  It was all good, just not as exciting as our breakfast had been.  It's probably that our bar had been set so high after our first visit there.

Would definitely return for breakfast."}
{"text":"food is always good. Sad they moved even if they only moved 1 mile. Portions are good and anything MAMA style is good times."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service and so accommodating! I wanted the corned beef hash (yummy!) but asked if I could substitute my hash browns and toast for a pancake. She said I could sub the toast for pancake AND gave me a fruit cup for the hashbrowns! Talk about people pleasing customer service. Almost unheard of! Oh, and the pancake was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Although the service is heartwarming and memorable (and I most certainly will not hold it against the 1100+ liars who projected the greatness of the service onto the food), the food is not great. If you like overpriced, average breakfast food, then enjoy! However, if you're hoping for flavor and fair prices, then don't buy into this hype."}
{"text":"My friends and I are back in town from our last Vegas trip back in 2014 and there's no way we miss a trip to Mr. Mamas. The owner Shaun is a really nice guy and very personable with his customers. The food is great, inexpensive and the packages are huge!"}
{"text":"The service is attentive, even though they were super busy.

I got the corned beef hash with roasted potatoes and eggs over medium.  It was delicious and really hit the spot.

My travel buddy got biscuits and gravy, which was my second choice.  Yes, I tasted some of it, and it was really good.

All that and some diner coffee left me more than satisfied."}
{"text":"A perfect breakfast spot. 

Came here for the first time to treat my best friend to a birthday breakfast. What a great selection of items and for a decent price. I ordered a cheese a mushroom omelet which came with a choice of hash browns or potato squares (I think that was the second option). You also get a side of toast. All for $9 - and it was delicious. Very moist and cheesy! My friend also had an omelet, can't remember what it was but it looked very yummy! Packed with veggies! 

I also really appreciate how quick the service was too. Even when it got busier they were still very attentive. 

It was 8am when we arrived; pretty dead at the time. When 9 rolled around, the place was packed - this was on a Monday."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate breakfast here. The service is very friendly and welcoming. The owner and host took time to talk to us. They were busy but that didn't affect the service. Our waitress was helpful and even let me sample the biscuits and gravy! Speaking of food I had the Greek omelet with bacon, hash browns and the biscuits with gravy. I really enjoyed the biscuits and gravy. The hash browns received good reviews here on Yelp but it was average to me. The omelet was good I enjoyed it. Hubby had a fried egg, hash browns with fried onions and peppers, turkey bacon and grits. He said everything was good but the bacon. I would recommend this place if you are looking for good reasonably priced food. It's about a 10 min drive from the strip."}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by the food, service and staff at Mr. Mamas. It is clear why they receive such great reviews. You feel like family from the moment you walk through the door. 

They were very busy and we had to wait 25 mins to be seated, which was not a problem. Once we sat down, we were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our drink order. A couple minutes later we met our server. Our food came out rather quickly and trust me it did not disappoint!! My omelet was fluffy and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak... the crunch on that steak was perfect! 

Some of the best customer service I have EVER experienced. At one point my boyfriend dropped his fork and at least 4 workers were there to remedy the situation. My coffee never went cold. The conversation with multiple employees was effortless. I am more than impressed with this place. 

Trust me it is my new spot and I will be introducing it to my family and friends. Amazing job Mr. Mamas!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place! We were greeted at the door by o e of the owners. The table and condiments were so clean and shiny I thought they were brand new! Everyone enjoyed their meal. 
All staff is really attentive. Prices just right. 
If you are visiting Las Vegas and have a car this is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"HOW this place doesn't have a full 5 stars is beyond me! My boyfriend and I go for breakfast here whenever we just want that Classic American Breakfast. We like to go when we don't want to deal with the hassle of cooking breakfast in the morning, but we still want the same love that we would put into the food had we cooked it ourselves. Mr Mamas has amazing service and hasn't let me down. I go for a classic breakfast sandwich, usually, but I can never resist a blueberry pancake on the side. Theirs are so fresh and fluffy!! What's also special about the blueberry pancake is that there isn't just one or two blueberries in it. It's really packed with blueberries. My boyfriend loves to get the country fried steak and I always take a bite or two from his plate. That country gravy! Yuuummmm. You just can't go wrong with the amazing food. The service is, however, why we even go to Mr Mamas. You won't be let down. Just know that they can get super busy! Go early if you want to beat the crowd. Otherwise, like my boyfriend and I, understand that there may be a short wait but it will be worth it for the excellent food that you'll have. Nick, the owner, always makes the wait short and sweet--greeting you before you've even entered the restaurant!"}
{"text":"So happy I went to breakfast here today! The service was fantastic and the food was great! I had to get the mamas stack, pancakes, 2 eggs & a choice of bacon, ham, or sausage. I obviously got bacon and was very pleased ! I would definitely recommended it :) thanks for the amazing hospitality & breakfast ! I will be back"}
{"text":"I love the tuna melts here they are awesome! Mostly everything I have tried has been decent and they give you pleanty of food. Hash brown are actually seasoned well! I recommended this place to my friends and family. Staff always friendly."}
{"text":"Glad this place is still going strong with its new location! Owner is a sweetie and very much the heart of this local joint. 

This place specializes in only breakfast and lunch. Quite a bit of variety for a place that is not a chain. Their meats and cheeses are fresh which is a big plus for me. Salads are fresh and do not taste like sulfites.

Kiddo and I had ham sandwich (wish they had sliced cheddar instead of only shredded), plenty of sides for us like cottage cheese and fries. Hubby had breakfast burrito which tasted great.

Disappointed no booths, only tables and no kids menu or choices/no crayons. Waitress forgot to use yelp deal I gave her. All else was good and we will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here quite a few times. The owner is a really nice guy who takes good care of his business. I wouldn't say their food is anything special that stands out about Mr. Mamas, but we keep going back because of the prices. Their prices are lower compared to other breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"I've been here on two separate occasions and had a great experience each time! When we arrived, we were told it was a 30 minute wait. There was a bunch of people waiting outside but only ended up waiting 15 minutes. The staff here is so friendly. Everyone that walked by made sure that we had everything we needed. I had the french toast and it was AMAZING. It also came out super quickly. Given how busy it was, I was expecting them to rush us so they could seat the next table but they didn't. The overall experience here was amazing and I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I took my mom and sister here while visiting for the weekend. I was playing daddy daycare so I had my son with me too.


I ordered the mama short stack which consists of 2 huge fluffy delicious pancakes...bacon that was perfectly crispy and eggs cooked your way.

Me and the boy shared...it was more than enough. We beat the crowd so it made the experience better!! Visit this place..it will cure any hangover...it's off the strip with ample parking!"}
{"text":"Great service and Great food!  It was great to get off the strip and have some great home cooked food at a great price. No high priced piles of food at the all you can eat buffets - just great food that was cooked with care. The owner came by to chat with us several times. It is obvious he cares about his restaurant and his customers. He even shared a great spot to visit off the strip. The only trouble was that in moving to a beautiful  new location/restaurant the address changed. Unfortunately yelp would not roll over the old site to the new address. We would have gone to the wrong address and missed out on a great breakfast. Be sure to visit the south jones blvd address!!
Yelp, please roll over all the reviews to the new Mr. Mama's site. They deserve the great ratings - both old and new!!"}
{"text":"SUPER friendly staff. Menu is as stacked as the pancakes. As we walked in, we noticed the giant portions and the giant stack of to-go containers stacked up near the kitchen and there seemed to be one on every table as well. Place is clean, well lit, and kid friendly. Giant HD TV's were tuned to ESPN and close captioning was on as well. Well done! Definitely recommend to out of town travelers. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place is an unassuming, not pretentious, little gem. Great food at reasonable prices. We had the steak and eggs, the Jenna wrap, a cinnamon roll, two teas, and an orange juice, and it all came out to about $35. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is because the steak was a little too well done (ordered it medium and it was not even a little pink inside). But I'm still conflicted on this because the rest was so good. Even their toast blew us away. Trust me, put some jam on the toast and eat it after the rest of your meal.
Also, the staff is genuinely nice. They're not just being polite.
Over all, 10/10 would recommend/repeat."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is outstanding !! That alone earns it 5/5. The wait was nothing maybe 15min. The coffee was served fast and hot. The food was great, corned beef hash was deff homemade, hash browns where typical, sour dough toast was fresh. The wait for the food was minimal and they where attentive and constantly topping off our coffee. Most deff will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"This place lived up to their yelp reviews.  My husband got the country fried steak and eggs (which was amazing) and I got the Marty wrap (fresh ingredients).  the kitchen computers went down so it took a minute for us to get our food, but who cares the food and service was great (shit happens)."}
{"text":"Average breakfast. French toast a tiny bit bland and served without any butter.  Scrambled eggs were pretty good, but again as a family visiting Vegas, not worth the 13 mi it's drive off strip.  Biscuits and gravy had a nice gravy that was unique, but the flavor was bland and the biscuit was super super dry.  

Felt like breakfast purgatory.  Nothing good, nothing terrible. Just breakfast. Feel like I would have rather been on the road home rather than eat here.  

The staff is super nice, service was great.  Just the food was average at best.  Can't imagine why the Yelp reviews are so high. The place just isn't that shockingly good how people make it seem.   Honestly two stars for food with a bonus star because the people were so sweet.  Won't be back sadly."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am completely baffled at how this place has a 5 star rating from so many reviewers. A friend was coming into town and wanted breakfast with us so I suggested this place because of the ratings, they were so good! My expectations were high, and what we experienced was very poor. 

Upon walk-in, our friends were already seated but we weren't allowed to sit next to them or put any tables together because there was no room, even though we were willing to wait to put our tables together. That was not going to happen & we ended up sitting there, waiting for a table while our friends got theirs. I told the host that it was okay, although honestly it was an inconvenience. Once we were seated, opposite of our friends' table, his parents decided to take our table so that we could sit with our friends. 

Our server was Julia, who seemed rushed. I understand, there's a lot of people waiting to be seated; I saw several customers waiting outside as well, but we are the ones seated, we shouldn't be rushed; we waited our turn just as they are waiting theirs. Once we ordered our food, it came back to us in a fairly good time. I ordered steak & eggs with hashbrowns and so did my boyfriend. Unfortunately my plate had my steak & eggs but it had thinly cut potatoe wedges/fries and I told her I asked for hashbrowns, she assumed my boyfriend asked for the thin cut wedges and told us to swap our steaks. She literally told us to swap our steaks. We had different eggs too, why would we swap plates????

My boyfriend said he ordered hashbrowns too so she left to get a separate plate of hashbrowns and said that now we could have both. (Although I didn't touch a single potato wedge thing.)

She frequently checked in on us.... A little too frequently to the point where again, it made us feel rushed. She spoke quickly, came and went quickly, and came too much. 

The food here was mediocre in comparison to other breakfast places. I have had better steak and eggs & I honestly don't plan on coming back here again. It's not terrible, but I didn't have a very nice experience and the food wasn't all that great either."}
{"text":"This place deserves 10 stars!! OMG!! The breakfast was amazing!! I couldn't eat all my food..they give you so much..Its enough for two ppl..I got the mamas stack:3 huge pancakes, ham, eggs and I added a hash brown..delicious!!! The price was reasonable..next time I'm in Vegas this will be the only place I will eat breakfast...4 days later and I'm still just in awe!!"}
{"text":"Great portions. Great prices and AMAZING owner and staff members.  Glad Yelp helped me find this gem!"}
{"text":"Great service, great portion size, great presentation and flavor. I would recommend it as we stayed at the Orleans Hotel and were looking for a breakfast place for young hungry athletes."}
{"text":"The old location seemed better, even though it was smaller it felt more like home cookin. Good place though, staff could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended and unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. This was a good basic breakfast spot. No frills or thrills. If I could give half stars, my rating would have been a 3.5.

I ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon. The eggs were cooked perfectly but my bacon was burned and my potatoes were way too salty. 

I arrived just past 8 am on a Saturday and had no problem snagging a table. Shortly after I was seated I did notice that the restaurant started filling up quickly. Around 9 am there was a decent waiting line and the place was packed. So, the folks in Vegas definitely like this place.

If you're looking for a decent basic breakfast spot give this place a try. The prices are reasonable, the service was fast and the food was good. 

Happy eating."}
{"text":"A big surprise ! The staff is so friendly and warm! Everyone including the wait staff seem so happy. 

The food was really good! Had an omelet and hash browns were the best I've ever had. 

Great for big crowds"}
{"text":"It is a good breakfast neighborhood place but I would not go out of my way to drive here. Hash browns, eggs, and french toast were tasty. We ordered biscuits and gravy and had pretty high expectations for it. Maple syrup in the sauce was so overpowering that we didn't taste sausage and biscuits. Overall it is an ok place with decent food and atmosphere but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Just wasn't that impressed! Went in with high expectations from other reviews and word of mouth recommends but it definitely didn't live up to the reviews. The cinnamon rolls were dry and hard the breakfast was average at best."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food and service was great! Favorite parts was the guy who comes outside and SCREAMS your name when your table is ready. Try it out."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. I really wanted to try their cinnamon roll first and foremost but it was a bit too dry on the inside for me. OK service, probably won't be back. They don't even offer waffles on their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Saw it was rated five stars and had to try.

First impression: walking to the door and a gentleman opens the door and welcomes us (first time this has ever happened to me) seated quickly.

Ordering: ordered 1/2 order of biscuit and gravy, she asked if I wanted a sample (which I thought was weird but I said yes because it was made with maple) tasted it and it was pleasantly different. 

Food: came quickly and was delicious, ordered a side of bacon and was surprise how it was perfectly cooked to how I liked it. ( not over cooked not under cooked and still juicy). Pancakes were amazingly good, fluffy and sweet.

Service: she was very friendly and nice, never got irritated and never over asked. 

Overall: a great place for breakfast on the way to Vegas. Will come here again on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is great I was there on a Tuesday morning around 9am.. The greet so so kindly and make you feel welcomed is a great place I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been here several times and never a problem. All the staff is courteous and treats you like family!"}
{"text":"If your passing by this small town I would definately recommend this place to grub at. Great service by our waitress Denise. Also Shaun the manager does a phenomenal job running this place with his strong management skills and amazing customer service. He really makes you feel good coming to have breakfast!"}
{"text":"Going to Las Vegas? I highly recommend Mr. Mamas at the corner of Jones and Russell. You won't be disappointed. The food is great. Portions are more than adequate. Customer service is over expectations. They make you feel welcomed.
I had the French toast, very delicious.

This is one of Las Vegas well kept secrets. Owner, Nick is happy to tell you about the family. 

Make it a point to visit next time you are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome Food. Great Prices. My normal waitress remembers my order. Customer service A++"}
{"text":"Great delicious breakfast! The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge. I ordered the chicken fried steak and a half order of biscuit and gravy. The gravy was delicious and I dipped it in everything. The chicken fried steak was crispy and and juicy. The staff was incredibly friendly, almost a family vibe to it."}
{"text":"Great food.  great service.  Huge portions.  Mr Mama was there to greet at the door and checked in with us quite a few times making sure we were happy with our meal and service.  He had a \"God Bless\" for everyone heading out the door.  Next time in Vegas, I'll look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"We first discovered Mr. Mamas in November of 2013.

We have been going back ever since.

We visited again today and we're just as thrilled with them. This was our first time at their new location. We

Below I s my original review. Prices have gone up slightly. The Chicken Fried steak was $1.25 more then in 2013. My omelet was the same.

Service was great. My coffee always full.

My former review below.Again from November 2013. 

I LOVE BREAKFAST!

Because of that I am not easily impressed, and I don't just hand out five stars.
It has to be earned.

With our Las Vegas trip planned  for the PBR Finals, I had already Yelped and decided what places we were going to try on out trip.

Mr. Mamas was at the top of my list.

We got to Mr. Mamas and were immediately seated.  
The staff was so friendly.
Our server was on the spot, my coffee cup never got below half way.

I had a Cheese Omelette (Pepperjack) and added tomatoes.
Hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.
and he also ordered some French Toast.  Everything was DEEEEEELICIOUS!
The portions were generous.

Last but not least talk about REASONABLE PRICE!!! Our breakfast was only $20.00

We had a lovely chat with the owner about his and his families history in the food business.   I loved the old photo they have of one of their restaurants in Detroit from long ago, complete with the mob guy in it coming for his weekly protection money.

The next time I am going to Las Vegas I am going to be more excited about my trip to Mr. Mamas then my trip to the rest of the town.

Great Breakfast and a wonderful owner and staff.   I so look forward to eating there again.

Bottom Line-This is a MUST go place if you are in Vegas and want to have the best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit here. The meet and the greet when you walk in was shocking, but in a good way. I felt right at home. The service was spot on, even the bus boy was on his game. Our drinks never even got low before they brought refills out. Food was really good decently priced. Definitely don't wanna miss out here. Being a local, I think i found my new breakfast home."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast / lunch stop.  We are almost always greeted at the door by the owner or a manager. The staff is outstanding. Our favorite server is Lordis, but anyone who has taken care of us has done a great job. Always clean, friendly, and attentive. All this and I haven't even mention the food which is exceptional. Simple fare done well! Portions are generous and always as ordered. Can't say enough. Great for families! Very kid friendly!  Also I have always been offered my beverage to go when we finished our meal. A nice stand apart from the rest."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me! I had ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine and girlfriend ordered eggs Benedict avocado and both were delicious, the hollandaise on top was creamy and flavorful. They even asked us how we wanted our eggs poached, which was a first for us as most places just do their thing. The order came with a side of hash browns which i ordered extra crispy with peppers on top . The staff was very attentive and always seemed to come right when we needed refills!  When we were all done and ready to go they even offered us to go cups for our coffee, now that's good customer service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place. They were also kind enough to suggest other restaurant to eat at, because we didn't mind to travel. Very clean, courteous, kind sums it up. I'm live in Chicago and go Vegas often. Matter of fact heading back in a week. I can't wait to get back"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've ever had in Las Vegas!! It's not on the strip, maybe a 15 min drive but it's well worth it! It's different than the casino buffets you'll get at the strip, more of a home feeling. The eggs were delish!! Not powdered watered down eggs, I loved the hashbrowns and the pancakes were perfect!! Oh!! And the service was amazing!! As soon as you walk in, they open the door and great and with a smile! The hostess was very happy and a positive face to see and my waitress was very attentive and sweet!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast!  Bountiful menu with delicious selections. The best Eggs Benny I have ever had.  The food is so good, we came back 4 out of our 5 days in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tired of the sticker shock and plethora of food on the strip, decided to go local.  Restaurant is a bit off strip, but ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!!

Short story: large portions and fabulous food! 

The deets: The food was excellent! Nice large cuts of bacon cooked to crunchy perfection. I had eggs over medium and BF had over easy-both cooked exactly as asked. Pancakes the size of the plate and delicious. Side of home fries were great-crunchy outside and soft insides-salivating just thinking about it. 

Did a to-go order for lunch and WOW! Ordered mamma's sandwich with a side salad and it fed both of us. 

Service was friendly and unpretentious. Restaurant has a homey feeling-nice after the glitz and hangover feeling of the strip. 

Will visit again when we return."}
{"text":"My friend liked her Denver omelet. I had the Veggie omelet the stuff inside was good except the texture of the eggs was Eeh, Flat and oily not fluffy and light like I expected. Subbed a pancake for toast. I asked for a liil bit of salsa and they charge $1.25."}
{"text":"First time today and I liked the food a lot. The wait wasn't long and the service was excellent. Been trying a bunch of different breakfast places on yelp and this one by far is my new favorite place. I got strawberry chocolate chip pancakes and they were perfect!"}
{"text":"Food is great, restaurant is very clean and the service is fast and friendly. I had the mamas stack and the pancakes are HUGE and tasty."}
{"text":"One of the great things about a restaurant is how the workers make you feel when you walk in. We were greeted by a friendly man and competent server. I ordered a wrap called the Marty. It was stuffed with hash browns, eggs, bacon. It came with salsa. Very satisfying. My husband ordered the corned beef hash. He was also happy with his choice.  The coffee was fresh and the server did an excellent job of taking care of us."}
{"text":"As a foodie, I really wanted to love this place. 

During my trip with my boyfriend to Vegas, we stopped here for breakfast one day based on the great reviews. I would give the experience, price, and service 5 stars for sure but meal wise it's a 2 star for me.

So let's start with service and experience. When we got there, there was a line outside. But surprisingly the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. And coming from a major metropolitan, that was amazing!

When we were seated the waitress was really nice and friendly. She checked up on us and the whole 9. Taking it a step further, one of the other employees saw us taking selfies and offered to take pictures of us together. Overall, very nice people.

Now, the food. Very nicely displayed. But I got a bacon and cheddar omelette which was decent but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend bought corned beef hash and was very displeased. It had all the corned beef and no hash (felt like we were delivered some fake news).

But here is the cherry on top. We ordered a side of pancakes. It looked really good - large size and couldn't complain. We go to take a bite? And it tasted like a pancake made from mix straight out of the box. Definitely my least favorite pancakes ever. 

So, I really wanted to love this place but the food deceived me. But I guess you get what you get for the price. I probably will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Legit can not say enough good things about how friendly these fine folks are. 

Typical breakfast food and burgers at really good prices. I ordered a chili cheese burger which was good, however I was expecting something a bit different. The burger was loooaddded with chili which made it very sloppy and not possible to pick up. When you order a burger you kinda have the idea that you're going to be able to pick it up and really bite into it. Either way, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Las Vegas and one of the best breakfast experiences I've ever had - and I eat a lot of breakfast!

This place is about 3 miles off strip but easy to find and lots of convenient parking. We arrived at 7:30 am on a Saturday morning and the OWNER opened the door for us and greeted us. Ample, standard dinner seating and before long we had coffee, had examined the menu, and were ordering. The waitress said the Cali Omelet was their most popular item so I gave it a try. 

Our coffee cups never went empty while we waited for food. My Cali Omelet was perfectly prepared and yummy - better than I expected. My daughter had the Denver Omelet and was equally pleased. The only part of the food not \"good as it gets\" was the toast - I've had better at Reno places that get their bread from Truckee bakery. 

While we were their the cook brought out samples of the daily specials for the staff to examine and take pictures of. We could hear him describing his dishes to the owner and staff and he took great pride in his food. 

We were asked several times how we were doing, including by the owner. I told him I found him on Yelp! where he was rated #2 and complimented him on his operation. He told me that while he appreciates the high rating he knows ratings are fleeting and he tries to operate everyday as if they were still trying to get to the top. It shows - the service and overall operations was truly impressive. 

I highly recommend this place if you find yourself in Vegas looking for a great place to have breakfast. Make sure to arrive early - the owner told me that after 9 am on a Saturday the wait time approaches 1 hour."}
{"text":"I used to go to Mr. Mama's old loaction on Decatur, but I must say that this is far better. The old location was, in a way, hidden from the masses, which kind of made it more secretive to loyal followers. This location is now out in the open. Mr. Mamma's has new tables, chairs, and a far larger location, which makes it far better than their last location.

I was very happy to see that there wasn't a change to their menu. I ordered the Cali omelette, which I've ordered in the past, and was not disappointed. The only thing I did differently, was had them add bacon to the omelette, which was only a $1.75 extra charge. If you want an actual side of bacon, with four strips, it's an additional $3.50. I paid $8.50 for my omelette with the old style hashbrowns, and a side of sour dough bread (you pick your bread). I also had iced coffee, which was $2.50 with unlimited refils. 

My friend ordered the French Toast and 4 strips of bacon. I felt bad for him, because my meal looked superior to his. He really enjoyed what he had though. 

Our waitress, Melissa, was excellent. She was very attentative and extremely nice. The owner is great, as well. He came over and talked to us for a minute and answered any question we had. 

This location is now around the corner from my house. I have a feeling I won't be going to many other places because of this. All my friends can be happy to know they have an amazing breakfast spot to indulge at when they come into town."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and the food was very good, fresh and large portions.  It was reasonably priced and the service was great - thanks Lourdes.  Everything was amazing but some of our favorites were - the French toast, hash browns, chicken fried steak and eggs Benedict.  We will definitely be back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"I am from Arizona and during our stay in Vegas we tried this place for breakfast because it was right down the street and OH MY GOSH the food is delicious, the service was great. and the owner even greeted us opening the door as we walked in. He is an awesome friendly guy that makes you feel right at home! Next time we are in LV we are sure to be back. :)"}
{"text":"The food was really good & the service was amazing . The people here made sure we were taken care of . One guy went out his way to ask if we wanted a group picture with all our food to just let him know. It was a really nice gesture . Definitely would recommend coming here for breakfast ."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and A-OK food! We came on a Saturday or Sunday morning and it was extremely crowded (30-45 minute wait) but we were eager to give this place a try so we patiently waited, staff moved quickly and provided great customer service/accommodating and food came quickly once we were seated. 

I will say, after reading the reviews you do expect more of a wow factor and sadly to say I was not blown away by the food. Was it good? Yes! Would I go again? Yes! Is it something to rave about/super great? Not really."}
{"text":"My husband & I are visiting from Tucson, I found Mr. Mamas on Trip Advisors listed as the #2 & we decided to check it out. Thank goodness we did! We've eaten there twice now & will probably come back before we leave town on Sat. They have the best breakfast burritos, everything in it is cooked perfectly & the salas is perfect temperature. The owners Pat & Nic are very welcoming & make sure to introduce their selves plus check that everything is cooked correctly! They have great PR skills! We highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Always fast and excellent service, the owner & his staff takes good care of his customers. BEST EGGS BENEDICT!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!  Super friendly service- from Mr. Mama himself to our waitress-  they know how to treat customers!  HUGE portions- had a \"short\" stack of 2 pancakes that could definitely be shared by 2 people.  Get the hashbrowns- they will cure any hangover.  My husband had a Greek omelette which he said was one of the best he's ever had!  Will definitely be back on my next vegas trip!  Thanks Mr. Mama!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING! Overall, the food is GREAT! Although when I went, I ordered the biscuits and gravy and not that they were bad, but they were just ok. But I took bites of everyone else's and the quality, taste and freshness was outstanding! 
Again, I cannot stress enough how AMAZING service was! The owner greeted us as we walked in, shook our hands and welcomed us. Every person that attended us was equally upbeat, friendly, smiling and just all around AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Two stars for service. No expo checking food with the owner walking around with his clip board. He needs to find out what the hold up is in the kitchen. Lots of people running around and getting nothing done. 25 minutes-still no food 
We probably won't becoming back. It doesn't matter how good the food is. The service sucks"}
{"text":"Food outstanding, service outstanding. Very friendly atmosphere.  Owner on site to great guests and bid goodby.  They treated customers as if they were guests in their home.  We ordered Cali and Spanish omelets.  Both were exceptional."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere new to have breakfast on the way back home. This place us a gem. The owner was gracious and welcoming to each and every customer entering and leaving.
Service was excellent and food delicious.
Will go back next time we are in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"When I first heard of Mr. Mamas, I assumed it was a quaint little Asian restaurant that draws most of its monthly profits from take-out orders of spring rolls. I have no idea where I got that notion from. Nothing could have been further from the truth. This place is a sit-in all-American sort of breakfast place and reminds me a lot of Eggworks on a smaller scale. That does not mean their food is any less delicious, though! 

My friend and I walked in at around 1 PM on a Sunday, and there were two or three couples ahead of us. The host told us there'd be a 15-minute wait time, but got us to our table after barely five minutes had passed. Under-promise, over-deliver, right? 
I got Mama's Breakfast Burrito with ham and the chunky salsa sauce, and it was great. It was admittedly a bit on the smaller side, but the ingredients and ham in it were so filling that I was full by the time I finished it.  

Our server was quick and attentive throughout our meal, as she kept our drinks refilled and checked up on us regularly. 

Overall, great service, great food, and close to my house. I will be back."}
{"text":"After Bella's dentist appointment at 8am, we decided to go have some breakfast and with Mr. Mamas earning a solid 4.5 star on Yelp, we dropped by and we are so glad we did.  Wow, the service is impeccable.  The kind gentlemen open the door to welcome us and quickly ask if we need a high chair and right when I said yes, he motioned for his team to set up the high chair so by the time we got to our table, there is the high chair.  Then as we are looking at the menu, the manager swung by and chit chatted with us, told us about the menu.  Very friendly.  

Our waitress energy was a bit down, but she got our order right.  I got the corned beef hash with hash browns and sour dough toast.  Everything was good except for the toast, it was a more on the burnt side (I looked over at the neighboring table and their toast was perfectly golden brown vs. dark brown like mine).  The hash browns was the star...I finished it. 

I give this place 4.5 Star."}
{"text":"This place is extremely affordable but come in BIG portions! The staff are so warm and welcoming too! Food is delicious! I don't usually like breakfast places but this one is better than egg works/IHOP etc! I love love this place 10/10 :)))"}
{"text":"went there due to good reviews..so we were optomistic..started out good..mgr came over very friendly..offered us free coffee to try it..said it was great.   we ordered simple breakfast..scrambled eggs toast and home fries..simple.  after a lengthy wait for eggs...they were cold. toast was cold.  ordered w/o butter..it was soaked w butter. sent back. it all came back hot but dried out. toast was also supposed to be lightly toasted. brought back w/o butter but burnt.  sent back again.  third time it came back not.toasted just warm. by then our breakfast was over so i had a plate of bread w no meal.  the free coffee tasted burnt and watered down terrible coffee.  the home fries were just sliced potatoes no flavor.   we ordered 2 coffees she brought one.  the list goes on. i kept smiling but the worse part was the waitress acted like it was our fault and had an attitude!   it was a terrible experience. after all the screw ups...the mgr knew and vanished..if he had come over and apologized we mightve given it another try but now we would not go back.  highly disappointing.  we really dont understand the reviews at all unless things are turning bad or they had an off day. puzzljng?"}
{"text":"Worth the drive, not only for the prices which are reasonable but for the amount of food you get at this place. I found this little gem based on Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed since sometimes reviews can led to a place being overrated.

I ordered the 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy and it certainly was plenty.  The coffee refills were endless and I appreciate the staff letting us know our food was delayed instead of ignoring our table which servers tend to do.

Decent size pancakes, omelettes and overall good value. Order light which means share with others"}
{"text":"Imma have to part 2 this review. Love the customer service so far. Staff speaks English and Spanish. My mom asked about corned beef which she had never had and they brought her a sample. Love it."}
{"text":"So...you walk in and the owner greets you like family.  Seats you promptly and the order is taken and you are served quickly.  One of the best breakfasts I've had.  They actually care here. I had bacon and eggs with extra crispy hash browns and wheat toast.  Top notch hash browns.  YUMMY.  Hubby had the French toast combo.  To top it off...the owner went to every table to assure every guest was satisfied...I had mentioned we were on vacation for my hubby's bday and he brought us a complimentary cinnamon roll...very tasty.  Can't wait to bring the kids in December."}
{"text":"My husband and I just happened to ride by this place on a fluke. We were hungry and the sign read Breakfast and lunch. We were like let's give it a go. So glad we did. The staff was amazing. Melissa was our hostess/waitress. She was very nice and friendly. She kept our water glasses filled as well as my coffee. The food was good and you get big portions. So big I had leftovers for breakfast this morning. The manager was nice and welcoming. She welcomed everyone as they came in the door. Steve( I hope that's his name) was also nice and made sure the guest were seated in a timely manner. The place was busy all day. Big groups were coming and going as we enjoyed our food. Thank goodness it was just the two of us as we were seated really fast. I will definitely be going back to Mr. Mamas in the near future!"}
{"text":"After seeing reviews calling this place, \"The best breakfast in Las Vegas...\" and \"Blown away\" I had to go and check it out for myself.  Actually went out our way to eat there.

Here are my honest feelings:

\"Blown away?\"  No.

\"Best breakfast in Las Vegas or anywhere?\"  No.

Mr. Mamas is a good, American style diner with good, albeit generic, breakfasts.  Nothing special, but good.

I had eggs with sausage patties and a biscuit.  My wife had poached eggs with bacon and my son had a pancake with a side of bacon.

I have no complaints at all with the food.  All served piping hot and exactly how we ordered them.  Eggs were perfect and my son's pancaked with huge and very fluffy and the service was great.

But again, when I see words like \"blown away\" and \"best\" this means (to me) something a step above ordinary...  Something special...  Diners Drive-ins and Dives type of place.  

So, great neighborhood diner.  Good breakfast at a reasonable price.

Destination...  Only if I'm in that part of town.  Not worth driving out of my way for."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Great service, great food, friendly faces. A rare pleasure for sure. I had the French dip with onion rings...they we're good but make sure you let them know how long to cook the beef. Overall, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We recently had lunch here. I was expecting something a little different after reading other reviews. It is a very casual diner. The lunch menu is pretty limited. We had the biscuits and gravy and a taco salad. No one came by to check on us after the food was delivered. Our server was ok, as was the food. We had to wave someone down for a refill. I ordered iced tea no lemon, and got a lemon. Not a big deal.  My boyfriend said the biscuits and gravy tasted like they came from a can. The biscuits are more crumbly than fluffy. Pepsi products in the fountain. Taco salad was average, I wouldn't call it good. They serve it with unseasoned red beans, which is weird to me. Other than that, it was pretty good. The lettuce was fresh romaine. 

Maybe we caught them on an off day or they are stronger at breakfast time. I am not in a hurry to go back but I wouldn't refuse if someone else really wanted to eat there.  Loved how friendly the host was."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!  From the moment we walked in we were greeted!  The guy at the door, was so happy to see us, like he was expecting us, like he knew us, like we were his family!  He said that so n so was going to seat us.  So she sat us at our table, and told us what our waitress name was, and that she will be right with us.  Everyone was so nice there.  So I got the Jenna breakfast wrap, it was good, I just expected it to be a little spicier because of the jalapenos.  But it was still good.  My hubby loved his steak and eggs.  As we were eating the guy at the door came over and checked on us, to see if everything was good.  Also one of the waitress came over as well and made sure everything was ok.   Then later, the guy came back that was at the door, and started chit chatting with us.  Come to find out he was Mr. Momma! (he was the guy at the door)   We love this spot.  I think we will become regulars here."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is our go to breakfast spots on the weekend. The staff is always friendly and makes you feel like you are a guest in someone's home. The service is super quick and the food is always delicious. We have never had a bad experience going there and we go nearly every weekend!"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Vegas,
Every time we are here we have to come, amazing food and owner,
Very recommended, from my experience best times are mid week and about 11 am"}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef hash I've ever had!  Even more impressive is the team that works there. Ro helped us today was attentive and helpful! 
I want to be sure that the managers there know that she is a tremendous asset to their restaurant and they're lucky to have her!"}
{"text":"Seems to be packed all the time especially on weekends but the food is worth waiting. Dont come here on a Sunday. It is about 45 mins wait, other rhan that, we appreciate everything from the nice and friendly staff, good food and affordability."}
{"text":"Even though breakfast seems easy, everyone can't do it!!! But Mr Mamas delivers again . Upon first walking in you will notice a friendly atmosphere that is very diner like and you will be greeted by extremely nice employees, they even open the door for you. This place is hopping all the time so be prepared for a little wait but the food is well worth it

So I ordered the chicken fried steak with hash browns, eggs, and a biscuit and it was the only meal I ate today lol. It was truly enough food for 2 people and it only cost $13 which was well worth it. The chicken fried steak come with a homemade gravy that has sausage and bacon in it and let me tell you it's amazing, the texture and taste are spot on. So after ordering we received our food within like 5 minutes which was insane and almost made me wonder if it was fresh but after tasting I knew it was just made so kudos to the kitchen for the prompt service . This place checks all categories for a breakfast joint- fantastic food, huge portions, great value, fast service, lots of options , and it's clean with a friendly staff.

I must say the only thing I would change is that I can tell they are trying to turn customers so after we ate we were kinda rushed along in a nice way so they can get the next person in. I completely understand where they are coming from , however , sometimes after I channel my inner fat boy I like to sit for a few minutes until after my I-'tis manifests lol"}
{"text":"Our new breakfast place !!!  Went twice in 4 days  best food ever ... best service ever and thank you Kat for being your beautiful self !!! You are an amazing and wonderful human being !!! When in Vegas EAT HERE !!!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out Mr. Mama's after reading the glowing reviews. This was my first stop and was told there would be a wait. No problem. The owner was within a couple of minutes from what he told me when I walked in. Great. 

I ordered the corned beef hash which the kitchen turned around quickly, way too quickly. The CBH was mushy and undercooked (no crisp). The owner stopped by and asked me how was my meal. I shared the same feedback and he said that the kitchen was busy and he would give them a reminder to cook the hash better, Really? He could have offered to have my meal replaced. He could have comped the meal since he acknowledged the problem. Nada. And nada again to Mr. Mama. 

As a fan of great corned beef hash, try EATS downtown for a real treat."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We wished we would have come here sooner instead of our last morning in Las Vegas.  I was with a party of 4 and we each ordered something different.  I had the chicken fried steak, eggs, and potatoes with a pancake.  It was all great.  The portion was bigger than expected and plenty of food.  The rest of my group had ham and cheese omelet, biscuits and gravy, and pancakes.  They weren't disappointed either.  This will be one of the places we make sure to visit each time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast and it was amazing! Food was great and service was quick and friendly. A great place for families who want good food that isn't over priced (portions are a great size and pancakes and wraps were delicious). 

Owner (?) offered to take a group photo for us and it was actually a great photo LOL."}
{"text":"All the times I have been here have been directly after gym class with the instructor so that being said I haven't experienced all the yumminess the menu has to offer. Not trying to order like a crazy person in front of him and undo the work I just did so I tend to stick with the Greek Omelet with feta cheese, onion, spinach, tomatoes, and garlic.  On the menu this would be a four egg omelet but I always get one egg and the rest egg whites, fruit instead of potatoes and dry toast.  Not super exciting but the service is always 5 star and I appreciate being able to make substitutions to my meal so in that regard they are very accommodating.   One day I hope to try one of the cinnamon rolls that seem to be so popular."}
{"text":"Oh, man! The food was great!! I got the French toast, eggs, ham and hash browns!! Everything was PHENOMENAL! My boyfriend got the Mr. Mamas burger and holy moly! It is the size of the water cup! He loved it and everything was made quick! Very impressed. When we come back to Vegas we will DEFINITELY be stopping here again! Our waitress was very friendly and quick! Loved it here!"}
{"text":"Ok...today is my birthday! I woke up craving steak, eggs, bacon, potatoes, biscuits and gravy! Omg...first of all...i think there's bacon in this scrumptious a$$ gravy...AND maple syrup....steak and eggs are delicious! Service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We love it here. The food is great, the service is always outstanding, and the vibe is always positive. 
I love, LOVE the Cali Omelette. The biscuits and gravy are amazing as well (sage sausage-yum!) and the hubs loves the breakfast wraps. It doesn't get much better than this for a good, casual breakfast/brunch/lunch experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in after church to check out this hotspot...

Chicken Fried Steak was very hearty and delicious and that cinnamon roll...ooey gooey goodness! No wonder it's always packed here, they know how to do breakfast!

Service is great here, and the owners are great people. It's funny listening to them on how Mr. Mamas got its name and start. Definitely one of the better breakfast spots in this area. Be prepared to wait, especially on weekends.  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Came here awhile ago with my husband and it was definitely a 5 star place. Well today me and husband ordered to go and they accidently charged him 2 times then refunded it all and charged him for the original amount of $12.38 well I opened up my omelet and I asked for a ham and cheese omlet and it's a giant slice of ham with scrambled eggs and nacho cheese. Not sure what happened this time but we will never return now. Sucks we thought we found a good breakfast place.
10/27/2016 : 
Owner of the place called shortly after this review to assure me that is not how they work and they had someone training and should not have been left alone. So my husband told him thanks for the call, he offered to make it up to us. I knew they were good the first time I understand ppl have bad days and this place for sure has very good management and the staff does seem to try there hardest."}
{"text":"Awesome service, all the waiters are super friendly and quicl turnaround time,it is worth the wait,"}
{"text":"5 stars for excellent customer service and 4 stars for the food! FMy friends and I stopped in Vegas for breakfast early in the morning on our way to Zion National Park. We were starving after being in the car for hours, sleep-deprived and cranky. But as soon as we walked in, the manager (?) and server greeted us very warmly and got us set up with menus and drinks very quickly. I decided to get the steak and eggs, which also came with hash browns. Honestly, THE BEST hash browns I've ever had in my life!!! Not even exaggerating. I've been dreaming about the hash browns ever since I had them... they were so perfectly crunchy and potato-ey. Enough about the hash browns haha, the steak was good but just a bit overcooked (I had asked for medium well but got well done) and the eggs were wayyyy better than your typical IHOP eggs. My friend got the veggie omelet, which he loved and my boyfriend got the chicken finger sandwich (chicken tenders between bread) and that came with a side of your choice. I would definitely come back here for breakfast the next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Not convinced that this place lives up to the hype.

Bowl of chili - They ask if you want cheese and onions added on top for an additional charge of 35cents each. not particularly a fan of places that charge extra for toppings when it should probably just come with it. Nothing special to the chili to rave about.

Chicken fried steak with their house gravy made with sausage, bacon, and maple syrup. The gravy itself was bland. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or just how it is suppose to be because I expected more flavor out of it. The steak however was very good. Better than most breakfast joints. Such a shame that the gravy came up short.

Home fries - crispy potatoes squares topped with peppers and onions. Again the toppings cost extra. Otherwise the potatoes would have probably been too plain.

Biscuits and gravy. Half order comes with one biscuit cut in half. Topped with the same gravy. The biscuit itself was very fluffy.

The service was exceptional. I came in around noon on a Sunday and waited only 20 or so minutes. Overall, I don't see anything that stands out compared than a typical breakfast diner. I really had high expectations after seeing such high ratings but was left disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Nothing tastes homemade.   The gravy on the chicken fried steak had zero flavor.  The pressure (read others have stated similar) to give a good review on yelp from the owner and staff makes u feel like you are there for the benefit of marketing thier company not enjoying a meal with your friends.   My daughter tried the French toast and ate just a few bites ..  overloaded sugar high of chocolate and powder sugar not flavor.

I am certian with the reading of the other reviews and the indirect nudge they must be getting these ratings unethically or with reward because it's not due to 5 star food or service.  I'm perplexed.  Just a average joint with below average atmosphere and nothing to write home about service.   The smell of funny business going on here.   Losing faith in the validity of yelp.   Would I go back, no.... nothing special for the drive."}
{"text":"Hubby had steak and eggs that we delicious!!! Best has browns I've had!! Staff was ridiculously friendly checked on us often and went above and beyond! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot when I'm in Vegas. I will definitely be making the trip to grab breakfast here even though it's a bit far from the strip. Their food is simply unmatched. I have never had a breakfast spot this amazing (well only 808 grindz in Hawaii). 

I ordered the eggs Benedict with the eggs a little over easy. I highly recommend the eggs Benedict if you are a fan. The hash brown came out nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. To top it off, it was perfectly seasoned. 

Service - the staff is very accommodating and polite. When you walk in they greet you with a smile and are more than happy to help. 

If you're in Vegas, come here!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down my favorite breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas ... or anywhere for that matter.  Mr Mama's hits the mark for all aspects of a restaurant -- fresh quality ingredients, service, timely receipt of meals, price & value, and friendly atmosphere.

I've been here maybe 6 times over the past two years (I'm from out of town).  Each and every time, my wife and I are greeted with an open door and a welcoming Mr Mama himself or one of his staff. 

The homemade corned beef is superb.  The Egg Florentine & Meat (I added the optional corned beef for an additional $2) is delicious.   And I found the Hashed Browns absolutely perfect -- golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft, warm, and tasty on the inside.

Each time, the wait staff has been very attentive and friendly.  Nobody stands around.  Each employee from the owners to the managers, to the waiters/waitresses, to the busboys work their butts off.  And Mr Mama makes the rounds to each table to thank diners for chosing his place and make sure everyone's dining experience is nothing short of great.  As I eat my food, I look around the room, watching the hustle and bustle of the employees listening to the other diners converse and laugh among themselves and interact with the enployees,  and Mr Mama bantering with his good-natured customers -- AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

It's like watching a well choreographed dance. And the food is excellent, as well.  What a wonderful way to start the day!

Thank you Mr. Mama's!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place off of the strip, and found this place.
Service was amazing. Our glasses were always full, the entire staff was very attentive and extremely personable!

We all got the Mama's Short Stack with scrambled eggs & bacon. Best pancakes ever!

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great service and a relaxed atmosphere. The food was just okay. The chicken noodle soup was really salty and the biscuits and gravy I could only take one bite because it was so bland! The breakfast sandwich was good and the home fries were awesome! I would come back to try other things, but overall I was disappointed since I expected a lot more!"}
{"text":"IF IN VEGAS YOU MUST COME AND EAT HERE! 
This place is worth the wait! Outstanding service and even better food. First time trying this place and it was even better than the yelp reviews described it to be. All the staff working there on Saturday morning were so friendly & kind, I saw a few helping guest take family photos and opening doors for people. 
The food speaks for itself, tasteful & filling.
I got the Ham and eggs with potatoes such great flavor! 
The iced tea was also fresh tasting and refreshing. 
Prices aren't that bad you get what you pay for and the food and service make you want to come back!
I live in California & I know I'll be missing this place big time
Keep up the good work guys!!"}

French toast is fluffy, with a nice batter mixture and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  Thick slices of bacon and eggs always cooked perfectly.  Attentive and good service, your coffee cup or water glass will never be empty.  Food always comes out fast and hot, despite the place is always busy during breakfast/brunch times.  Prepare to not eat for the rest of the day!"}

I can tell the owner takes pride in his restaurant, and it shows through the employees, the service, and the cleanliness of the establishment. The food is great, and the menu is very simple. We will definitely be back whenever we come back to Las Vegas."}

This year we came on a Friday and wait was 15 minutes.  But once we were seated, the service was extremely fast, servers/staff were attentive,  meals came out quick and hot!   Certainly worth the wait.  I had the eggs benedict with sausage and my husband had the French toast.   Both were delicious and very satisfying portions."}

Quick, accurate and very freindly service. Reasonable prices for delicious food! It complements to the chef, owner and manager!"}
{"text":"so... after reading all the rave reviews on mr mamas, we came in today for a late brunch with super high expectations... maybe a little too high. first off, i wana say that our server Lenore was the bees knees! very friendly, personable and on-point :) 

now, moving on to the food... dun dun dunnnnnnn... 

- i had a cheeseburger and fries, which was good... not great, not horrible, just some where in the middle (comparable to a dennys burger, perhaps?)  

- my hubby had the eggs benedict w/ sausage and a side of corned beef hash... which he totally should NOT have - the hollandaise sauce was super bland, it had no flavor at all... (and i even tasted it to make sure he wasnt being super picky).  the corned beef hash seemed like was out of a can (and not a good brand either) the potatoes were ground up w/the cornbeef and it was just 'meh' 

on a good note:
- our son had the biscuits and gravy, which is his all time FAVE and everyplace he eats them he rates them on a scale from 1 to nana's (w/ nana's being the best of course) and he said they were right up there w/nana's!

in conclusion... if we do go back, we will all order the biscuits n gravy ;)"}
{"text":"Our first stop for breakfast after relocating to Vegas and it did not disappoint.  The customer service was stellar,  from being greeted at the door upon walking up, our exceptionally kind server, and being thanked upon our exit, we felt the gratification and kindness just for being a patron. The food was a wonderful start to our day.  We went in heavy because of needing something to carry us through the unloading of our moving truck later that day, and Mr. Mamas delivered with huge portions for every order. I had the eggs Benedict, a favorite I can't turn down, and it was fantastic. The ham was hearty and thick. The eggs were poached beautifully.  My daughter ordered their cinnamon roll, hashbrowns, and a hot chocolate. The cinnamon roll is gigantic! She is still talking about the hot chocolate being the BEST she has ever had a week later. We tried out the biscuits and gravy and again,  that plate is going to fill your belly! They definitely have a different take on the classic sausage country style gravy, with other meats in it and maple syrup too. It was too sweet for my husband's liking, but I found that with a little salt it balanced well and worked. My baby is a pancake guy so we chose a short stack for him with eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns. We were cautioned that the pancakes were large and they weren't kidding.  Fluffy plate sized pancakes! I will add that his over medium eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! Most places can't do them without crisping the whites and we hate that, but these were gorgeous! Finally,  I will note that my coffee was so good.  I don't know if it was because I was in dire need of caffeine, but this was better than your standard, weak cafe cuppa joe. Good flavor and strong enough to withstand my love of cream! If I had one critique, it would be that the table was a little too tight for four people with all the plates we had going on, so next time we might ask to take away the condiments in the center to help give a little more room.  Nothing to grimace about though and we will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the most disarmingly polite service I've ever seen at a restaurant. Their attention to these small interpersonal details is commendable. The restaurant was also impeccably clean - our table was immaculately set, all of the condiments were wiped totally clean (even the syrup bottle and these can get a little gross and sticky and diners), and the condiments were in a caddy on the table with all of the labels facing forward. 

For breakfast, I got the eggs florentine and added ham. I also got a side of hash browns and a single pancake (I was hungry). When it comes to hash browns and pancakes, I think they're hard to screw up but also hard to make shine and in both cases Mr. Mama's versions of these dishes were a cut above the rest. Both were very tasty and worth ordering again. The eggs florentine was probably the only area of opportunity for improvement. For the most part, the dish was tasty and plated well, but the spinach was really under-seasoned and there was enough of it that it made the entire dish taste a little bland. 

My partner got the chicken fried stake and it was delicious. I stole a bite and then kept finding myself taking more and more because it tasted so good. Yum.  

Ultimately, I would say that Mr. Mama's lives up to its yelp! rating and I would recommend eating here to anyone considering a locally owned off-strip breakfast option while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not impressed and so disappointed after all the good reviews. The long wait was to be expected. We ordered a hash with a side order of biscuits and gravy and then just traditional bacon and eggs. There was a giant hair in the sausage gravy. Enough said. They refunded the meal and we went down the road to farmer boys."}
{"text":"Amazing food all around. Friendly service and huge portions at a great price. I had the French toast with strawberries and whipped cream, OJ, and coffee, and bites of my friends' hash browns which were perfectly seasoned and cooked, and their homemade biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Best diner style food in Las Vegas period.  Sure, the service may be a little slow and it may be in a smaller strip mall off of the strip, but the food is too good to pass up.  If you are a sucker for diner styled food, think hearty breakfast with pancakes, country fried steak, eggs, and corned beef hash, Mamas has it all.  Ample seating and no frills service.  The food is really awesome, and the portions for each entree are probably enough to feed two people."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I'm so satisfied! Since the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out we were treated with kindness! #sodelicious #mrmamas #greatservice #delightfulpeople #greatprices"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The staff is beyond friendly, making great recommendations. You can tell this isn't a place that skimps by their heavy silverware and generous portions. Even their bacon is thick and some of the best I've had in years. Hats off to Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"Once I walked in I was greeted by such friendly employees it felt more like family. I will definitely be back when I come visit Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!! We experienced delicious food and the best service EVER at Mr. Mamas today. Everything about our experience here was outstanding! 

The gentleman who greeted and sat us was friendly and, quite simply, great at his job! He chatted with us while we waited for a table, asking where we were from and telling us about the delicious things on the menu.

Once seated, another friendly fellow thanked us for coming and asked us if it was our first visit, which it was. He recommended a few items and told us to let him know if we needed anything. I've since learned via yelp that he is the owner. His energy was amazing. We watched him make his way to every single table while we were there. 

Immediately after that, our server, Lourdes, welcomed us, told us about the specials, and made some recommendations. She was a perfect server. I drink lots of water and she was right there with the water pitcher before I even had to ask for refills. Throughout our meal she checked on us and paid attention to our needs. 

While waiting for our food, we watched how the dining area ran like a perfectly oiled machine. There was excellent communication between the front door folks, the servers, owner, kitchen, and bus boy, who wasted no time getting to each table when it was vacated. 

My husband had the chicken fried steak, which was the best he had ever had. My Greek omlet was terrific. Both the hash browns and home fries were fantastic.

Mr. Mamas has the best service in all of Las Vegas! We are locals, who have eaten our way across most of town, so I know what I'm talking about. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was good. It was very busy so we placed a to go order. Seems like a good place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place to start your day. Probably the best customer service I've had at these kinds of establishments. All the employees were extremely friendly and seemed glad to be working. And of course, the food was amazing. The pancakes were huge and tasted incredibly delicious. Every breakfast place has pancakes but the ones here are so fluffy and sweet. As for the ham, it was such a huge piece! And to top it off, they let you take your coffee to go! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was more like a 3 star, but I gave it a 4 star cause the waiter was kool and did a great job.  It was my first time going and I thought the food was average.  I tried your traditional chicken fried steak, the gravy was runny.  I'll give it another try cause there were other items that looked worth trying."}
{"text":"The food is cooked to perfection. Homemade corned beef hash is amazing. The pancakes are so fluffy and the biscuit and gravy are the best. The service is outstanding. The owner is so welcoming. It's a great place to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"This resturant has theee most impeccable service I've ever experienced. From start to Finnish it was nothing less than amazing. Fast friendly and comfortable is what my family and I experienced. let's not forget about the food though, the portions was just enough if your feeling extra hungry and the taste was fresher than any other resturant like it. I can't wait to visit again when I return to Vegas they can have my money anytime as long as they stay the same."}
{"text":"Just left from having a late breakfast at Mr Mamas and ohhhhh my goodness. We are so stuffed and so satisfied with the food and service. 

We ordered the Chicken fried steak and eggs and the regular steak and eggs with a side of biscuits and gravy. Everything tastes absolutely delicious! Even the coffee was great. Our waitress Jenna was super friendly, as was everyone else working there. 

I highly recommend this place. This will definitely be my go to place next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Vegas (on the strip) when a friend recommended their favorite off-strip restaurant. We decided to try Mr. Mama's not only based on their recommendation but also the many positive Yelp reviews. 

I hade the breakfast burrito, husband had the corn beef and hash with a side salad, daughter #1 had a BLTA with chicken noodle soup, and daughter #2 had an a la carte pancake. All of us thought the food was good. Daughter #1 raved about the chicken noodle soup. The side salad that my husband had was huge, a generous portion for sure. The pancakes are also really big and perfectly cooked, but one was plenty for the eight year old. 

The owner is incredibly personable and was the person taking names up front when we got there. He quoted a wait of about 30 minutes and we waited about 25 - decent as the place was pretty packed for a Friday at 11:00 am. He was chatting with everyone and you can tell he loves his customers. He really was all over the place overseeing everything and I think his involvement makes a difference in the success of the place. The service was great and the employees seemed to love their jobs - yet another difference maker.

One really lovely perk is that they offer you a to-go cup and that's awesome as we have an eight hour drive ahead of us so having an ice cold drink was just a nice offer. 

Our entire meal was just over $44.00. After paying $75 (average) for meals on the strip that were subpar in most cases, this was a great deal."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Had pancakes and sausage. And a biscuit and gravy on the side. Both were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Wanted something away from the strip, wanted to go where the locals go. Actually found this on google. Service was GREAT!!! MR.MAMA'S himself came to our table, introduced himself and was a wonderful person. Food was   wonderful , service as well. Staff was friendly and the experience was just wonderful!!! Will DEFINITELY be back on my next trip to Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so great I just cant believe we've never seen it before. The pancakes are almost as big as the plate the come on. I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine were so fresh and creamy. They also have these deliciously heavenly biscuits and gravy. I order half of a half order just to try them. The gravy has sausage, bacon and maple syrup!!! Hubby had Soup and Salad with a cup of Beef Vegetable soup that tasted just like the one make at home. His Greek Salad was brimming with Feta and Kalimata olives and came with the most delicious pieces of garlic toast. All in all I think this place is our new 'go to breakfast place' in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great places for breakfast I usually post pics but it was so good it dint make it. I order bacon eggs over easy and hash browns with side of toast everything was seasoned salt pepper some extra little green stuff on the eggs was very good like parsley or something. The bacon was thick cut. And potatoes very fresh. I order everything to go and they included the jam jelly paper towels ketchup yummy meal. And coffee bean is just down the street."}
{"text":"You know a place is pretty good when there's 350+ reviews and has a solid 5 stars. Also when you show up to have the owner welcome you in is something you don't see very often. They food was absolutely AMAZING for an AMAZING price!!!! I got the Marty Wrap which has avocado, pepper jack cheese, crispy bacon, eggs, and potatoes. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas. If you haven't been to Mr. Mamas yet, you're missing out!!!"}
{"text":"OMG I'm very impressed with this place! I don't say that lightly either, especially about breakfast places. I cook a mean breakfast so I have high standards.

Eggs Benedict were quite possibly the best I've ever had. The eggs were poached to perfection! They even asked how I wanted: medium? Very good English muffin. 

Most impressive was the service: my server Jazmin was attentive and pleasant. Hosts are also quite friendly. Overall a great experience. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Good value restaurant. Cheap breakfast no ambiance. Big portions. Service is generally good. Guys in front are very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is a very popular destination. If you arrive close to noon, there will be a waiting g list. The best thing about Mr. mamas is the customer service followed by the food. They successfully do their best to accommodate their guests. The food is good but not exceptional. It is what I expected from a popular eatery. The staff was pretty much on-point."}
{"text":"What makes Mr. Mamas so damn popular? Two things -- incredible, over-the-top service and affordable prices for some amazing food. 

We were on a road trip from California and Vegas was our first stop. We came right when the place opened, which was awesome since I hear Mr. Mamas can be packed during the weekend. First thing you'll notice right away is the service. Everyone from the restaurant was so unbelievably friendly, happy and accommodating that it had to make me wonder -- how are all these people so happy about life? Why are all these people so damn friendly? On my reviews, I tend to focus more on the food than anything else, but their service is on a whole other level. 

... Especially Mr. Mama. Oh yes -- he is real. You'll know who he is right away. You can really tell how much he cares about his customers just by the way he talks. 

Food-wise, I really can't complain. Their food is amazing, and the prices very affordable. Amazing, but nothing extremely mind-blowing, maybe except for the Mama's Chicken Fried Steak though. That stuff is bonkers. It was so delicious, and even had a slight crisp inside which I was not expecting at all. I would say if you were to get anything from here, it would be Mamas Chicken Fried Steak for sure.

----
The Verdict: Mr. Mama gets a well deserved 5 stars because of its amazing food (especially the chicken fried steak) and even better service. I've never felt so welcome in my life. 

Recommendation: Mamas chicken fried steak"}
{"text":"Yes its just a breakfast place but that breakfast is really good. That and great service is the reason its my favorite place to eat on some Sunday mornings.

Get there early or later because it gets super busy. At times have waited 45 minutes! However they do offer take out if you decide to leave.

The california omelette is one of my favorites !"}
{"text":"Wow!  This is easily one of the best breakfast resaurants I have ever eaten at.  As others have mentioned, the owner is super nice.  We showed up literally a minute before closing and they welcomed us in and everyone was very friendly and polite asking us to take our time.  The food was phenomenal, basically perfect.  I didnt know breakfast food could taste so good.  The toast and hashbrowns were just crispy enough and not too oily, everything tasted great and was cooked just right."}
{"text":"For a breakfast diner this place does a great job from service to quality of food. 
I ordered the half order of biscuits and gravy and an over easy egg. Speed of service was quick. Would recommend and return if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"We had thee best breakfast here in Vegas. So if you ever in town come here and have a tasty meal. It was recommended by my son and I'm a fan. Aloha"}
{"text":"Awesome place to have breakfast. Portions were good size, and price was decent. Mr. Mama was walking his restaurant and talking with the families there, super nice guy. 
Big up to this restaurant.
Kind of crowded, so plan to wait for a table.. but well worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and service was great. It was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The only down side was that they did not have a kids menu so had to buy a full plate for my two year old."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lots of seating, friendly service.  Can't speak for the lunch menu but had the Cali omelette and was quite good.  Everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"For a Saturday, the wait was 45 min, which isn't bad. Worth the wait though. First time here. We were looking for a new breakfast place while visiting from San Diego. Found it! We will definitely be back! I'll just ask for no oregano on my hash browns."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast with huge portions. The staff is great and the food is delicious. The atmosphere is very homie. I would frequent this place."}
{"text":"Mr mamas is a great place!!! We go there every time we're in Vegas. Super affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews from co workers so I decided to give this place a try. I'm glad I did! They are very busy, waiting about 20 minutes to sit but it is breakfast rush hour. The menu is pretty simple, all of the classics. The food came out so quickly I was shocked. It was big portions, hot and tasty. They manager and waitress came to check on us multiple times. I'm so used to getting mediocre customer service that this was a shock to me! I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on yelp I decided to try some breakfast at Mr. Mamas this morning. The restaurant has a comfortable/casual atmosphere and, more importantly, is also nice and clean. Despite being pretty busy the service was great as was the food. I went with family and everyone enjoyed their meal. I recommend the Spanish omelet (I added mushrooms) but the pancakes looked good as well. 

The only drawback for me was the fact that I asked for dry toast and got it with light butter. To nitpick a bit more I also didn't like the idea of the waitress taking orders with a phone. I understand she doesn't handle the actual food but paper and pencil seem more sanitary to me. Minor complaints on an otherwise enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype. Normal breakfast food, excellent service BUT all about the UPCHARGE. Want some salsa for your eggs, upcharge, want some peppers and onions added to your homefries, upcharge. Want some meat in your entree, plan on less than 1 ounce of it. But I'm sure you can request more for an upcharge LOL. Original pancake here I come. With so many over the top places to go, this place resonates way to plain Jane for me."}
{"text":"The service will have you coming back again and again! Thank you, Mr. Mama staff and management, for making me feel valued and special. Culinary bliss! Every meal is better than the last. This week, while on a short vacation to Las Vegas, my friend and I have eaten here for 3 meals (in 4 days). Totally worth driving off the Strip (5 mins) for the fantastic food and personal attention. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious, had the marty wrap, and was amazing!!   Will definately come back!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast to go. Excellent service. Someone opens the door for you! My breakfast burrito was simple yet one of the best I've had. It's just the usual eggs, sausage, hash browns & sausa in a flour tortilla yet tasty! The cup sausa was excellent. It enhanced the burrito even more.
  My party had the eggs, pancake, toast, the waffles; all good portions & standard fair."}
{"text":"Amazingly attentive.   If you like spicy, they have chili's if you ask.  Ate w/my parents, uber picky dad and he liked it.  I enjoyed the healthy options.   If you are into gravy, they offer a sample before you order!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food!! Nice place to spend my Christmas Eve birthday breakfast at!!"}
{"text":"Amazing french toast and it's cheaper than most breakfast places I've been to. Definitely going to be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The veggie omelet was so good.  The service was exceptional.  Denise was very corteous.  I can't? wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"Lots of great dishes for breakfast, I had Mama's French toast & it was very tasty! Friendly & fast service!"}
{"text":"Going to this breakfast joint makes me realize in retrospect that there a few 5 star reviews that I should have not given in the past, because this place ladies & gentlemen, just set the precedent for all my future 5 star reviews. 

Even before walking in, I felt the hospitality when an employee greeted us and opened the door for our party to come in. It was a Tuesday morning so we were seated right away even though the restaurant was about 80% capacity.

Every single employee we dealt with while we there was mad nice & courteous, a couple times I had to do a double take & ask myself if this was real? Lol. The coolest part is that Mr. Mamas himself came over to our table to introduce himself and asked if everything was going well & if there was anything they could do. Now that is customer service!

Now on to the food, everyone enjoyed what they ordered and felt that the quantities were copious. The pancakes they have here are fucking huge, I noticed the strawberries they use for the toppings were fresh and not that mushy old jam looking shit. The steak & eggs I ordered was great and had perfect grill marks. Not even the places I've paid $19 for the same plate can get it right like these guys can. 

I'll definitely be back next time in Vegas, it's one of those places I won't be passing up anymore."}
{"text":"The wait time is something that we were not a fan of, but I guess when they serve good food that's the price you have to pay. The staff was friendly and once we were able to place our order the food came out fast and hot. The portions were good, the flavor was there there and the location was convenient. Over all the experience was great and this would be a location we would revisit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Incredible food.  This restaurant  is fabulous and the staff is extremely friendly. . It's off the strip and roomy.  I  strongly suggest  if you are looking for reasonable food and great service ."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, the staff was nothing but friendly and helpful. They provided excellent service and excellent food also. The owner walks around making sure everyone is doing great and you can tell how much he cares about his business! We are from out of town and next time we are in Las Vegas we will make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"We always stop by for breakfast whenever we're in the NV area.  Great restaurant overall; everything we had were great at reasonable price, service has always been impeccable."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Staff and crew are fast and accurate. 
FOOD IS GOOD. Their homemade gravy is really good and the serving is huge! Even our 15 year old son was not able to finish his chicken steak. My eggs benedict is good but not something i will order again. But i will definitely come back to try other food."}
{"text":"Just as good as people say it is. Warm welcome throught he door and great service throughout the meal. Ordered eggs benedict, swiss mushroom burger, and the countryfried steak. We also got fries, hashbrowns, and toast. Absolutely everything was delicious. It was breakfast but everything was much more savory and tasty than your average breakfast food items. Used the groupon $15 for $30 and the bill came to about $36 total for 2 people (1 other person in my group just ordered fries and orange juicce). Very affordable, very tasty, very worth it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!

Ordered:
Homemade Hash and Eggs, Hashbrowns, Marble Rye, Coffee
Biscuits & Gravy, Hashbrowns, Sausage, Eggs

Everything was amazing. Seated pretty quick for how busy it was. Friendly staff, all around. Coffee was great, perfect start to the meal. Food came out quick. Every bite that we ate was more amazing than the last. It shows that they care about what comes out of that kitchen.

GO TO breakfast spot for us."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was amazing.  Many of the top restaurants in Vegas can learn something from Mr. Mamas.  You are warmly greeted from the moment you walk in and that flow continues until you exit. The eggs Benedict was wonderful. Lenor was a great server."}
{"text":"So I'm in Las Vegas once again 
, although I love staying on the strip. I'm not a big fan of eating my meals on the strip unless I don't have a choice. Today I utilized my choice very well. The wait wasn't bad. 20 to 30 min wait for a late Saturday morning. Customer service is great. My server Claudia was great. Sean and Cathy vibe with the guests perfectly. I had the egg, sausage patty, home potatoes, and French toast. Everything was delicious potatoes a little on the salty side. My breakfast would have been a grand slam if they served grits, but it did get me to third base lol."}
{"text":"Coming from the state of California... duuuuuuuude, I wish they have a spot back home !!!! Honestly, best breakfast service and food I have had in Las Vegas. I had the country fried steak, unfortunately , I had to tap out... I was too full lol. As personally being a server in Cali, our server, Jenna, is amaziiiiing!!! She is VERY attentive and an all around great server. She informed us about the breakfast specials, throwing jokes, and whatnot. The environment is sooooooo energetic and it's just such a positive vibe. Oh, the other employees are very friendly too!!! From the beginning on having the door opened as we entered and finishing up with a checkup by the owner -- Amazing service. Oh, can't forget, the food came out fast! Can't wait to come back for another breakfast service :) thank you so much, Jenna !!!"}
{"text":"Some people say Mr. Mamas is overrated. I say, \"I don't care because I'm a fan!\" I started going to Mr. Mamas at their original location and I've gotten my whole family to love Mr. Mamas too. 

Here are all the pros:
1) There is hardly any wait even when you roll in at 9am on a Saturday morning! From where I live, there is always usually a wait! You'd be lucky to wait for only 20 minutes and not 60! 

2) The food is never bad. It's not the most creative in flavor, taste and presentation, but it always leaves me full AND the portions are generous! My mom and I always share an entree and we can barely finish ours especially since you get so much bread too.

3) The value and the prices are fantastic! For four people, three entrees and two coffees, our bill was $32.44!! That's $8.11/pp! 

4) The service is always good! The owner is friendly, personable, and thanks you for being a customer! I had a wedding album to show off to one of the members in our party and he overheard that we just got married so after we were done eating, he gave us a complimentary cinnamon roll and it was so damn nice, so damn good, and so damn free!!

So don't visit Mr.Mamas looking for the best breakfast in flavor and creativity. Come to Mr. Mamas for the value, service and convenience!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant! The food is delicious and the early morning atmosphere is relaxing. There is no music playing, which I personally do not prefer in a restaurant around 6 am, but a low volume tv with subtitles broadcasts news. The special was blackberry french toast, which had a distinct cinnamon flavor (an improvement to the typically low cinnamon and higher sugar or butter flavor to some french toast dishes) complimented by the sweetness of whipped cream dollops and fresh blackberries. The owner creates a hometown feel with an appreciation of his customers. I think that with a little Forbes 500 training, this restaurant would skyrocket; the recipe is certainly present! Mr Mama's is a must-go!"}
{"text":"I went to Mr. Mamas based on the high number of reviews with 4 stars or better. I was extremely disappointed with the food. I ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was like chewing on a rubber boot."}
{"text":"Been here twice! I'd come more often but I live out of state! The service is amazing!! Everyone here is so nice and genuine! The first time I came here I ordered an omelet. It was tasty. Love the home fries. Also tried the chicken fried steak, the gravy is so good! Food was tasty! The prices were more than fair! I'll be back when we visit Vegas for sure!! But the service, I can't even put it into words how amazing it is!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Portion size is very generous. Staff is so friendly and goes out of its way to make your dining experience a good one."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! Would visit again for sure. Place gets really busy on weekends. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Its amazing!! When in Vegas my husband and I HAVE to eat here at least twice! The staff and owner are genuinely nice. The food is delicious really no matter what you order will be delicious with generous portions. Order a bowl of chili and put it on everything you order it's soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast spot. Food was delish and our server was on point. The only downfall, I would say, is the wait.. it was about a 35-45 minute wait and I was starving! You know the food is good when there's a long wait lol. Our server was Jenna and she was amazing! You know how sometimes they forget the lemon in your water when you ask for it... or even the side of ranch to go with your fries? Yeah, not Jenna! Her service was on point AND she made sure our drinks were always filled without us even needing to ask for a refill (one of my pet peeves at restaurants). 

Ordered:
-Cup of chicken noodle soup= 5/5. Perfect size to start off with before my meal. Used with macaroni noodles.
-French toast with side of bacon=5/5. So good! My favorite out of all we ordered and the bacon was cooked perfectly: large with a crunch.
-Chili and cheese omelet= 4/5. Pretty large portion for me.
-Steak and eggs= 3/5. Just your typical steak, over easy eggs, and french fries.

Would definitely be back if we're in the area and just wanting some good ol' regular breakfast."}
{"text":"Visited while on vacation in Vegas.  Great breakfast place. Had an omelette and added the French toast at the suggestion of the server. Nephew had the chicken fried steak. Both were very good. 

Service was very good. Was checked on and thanked by a lady who was not our server.  I drink gallons of diet soda and server kept up. Place was clean and food arrived quickly as well."}
{"text":"I had the absolute best chicken fried steak I have ever eaten! We had a good overview picture taken of us and our meals. Thank you Sean! You and your employees are wonderful. My server took the time to explain the menu and ensure we were ok and our drinks were filled. Excellent service and great portions."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast in Vegas.   Large portions.   Tasty food.   Interesting specials.   Great service.  And all for a pretty reasonable (for Vegas) price.   My husband, son and son's girlfriend made it our go to breakfast place during our stay.  Warning that there can be a wait - it's popular but worth it."}
{"text":"A Thursday morning and a 15 minute wait. I take that as a good sign that they have that kind of business in the middle of the week. After ordering I talked with Mr. Mama himself and then my food was there. Huge portions of comfort food."}
{"text":"Found this place while searching for a breakfast spot online and it did not disappoint. From entrance to exit the staff was awesome. Everyone enjoyed their food. And can I just say those were the most delicious sausage patties I have ever had. Just be forewarned the portions are pretty big. We had leftovers galore. I will say I wish they had a children's menu but never the less now we know for next time. OJ was so fresh and service was quick. Plus they have wifi."}
{"text":"Loved it. When I walked in, they opened the door for me, greeted me, and were genuinely happy to see me. I ordered an omelette with cheese and meat. Take note that it's cheaper to just build your own rather than to order omelettes as they come on the menu. I met the owner, Nick, and he was very nice and talkative. If you want a place that has stellar customer service, this is the spot. And the food is great too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast with our daughter. Met the owner, Nick, who was very personable. He, and the rest of his staff took great care to make sure everyone in the restaurant was taken care of. Food was great as was the service."}
{"text":"Very good food. Quick and tasy. I got the cali omelete it was a big portion. Wanna try benedict eggs next time. The staff is really nice they even opened the door as we walked in! Great spot, we passed by so many times and never saw this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! The staffs are really nice and attentive. This is the best breakfast dining place in the area! I love their Chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! The burgers are do good and juicy! The breakfast had large portions and flavorful. It is worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Five stars is not enough. We were in town visiting from Milwaukee and and pulled in to get breakfast quick at subway but decided to check this place out. The entire staff was extremely nice and helpful, and the food was outstanding. Seriously the best French Toast I've ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Great portions for the cost!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. All I can say is that food is great and service is awesome. And that's the reason people keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"New location!

Yup they moved from their old location and it's a lil bit further from the strip but trust me, it's still worth it! I took 3 friends here as it was their first time and all of us loved it!

I ordered the Veggie Scramble Wrap with Hash Browns Well Done on the side. It also came with a cup of fresh salsa. Loved the fact that Cholula hot sauce was on the table and boy was this the most delicious wrap that I've ever had! No bacon, sausage or ham up in this though it tasted as if there was. SO DELICIOUS!

Coffee was ordered and refilled constantly thanks to the superb service of this establishment and our super waitress - CATHY! She's on point and takes care of you. We really didn't need to ask for anything.

Anyways, I'm more than willing to leave the strip every time I go to Vegas just to have my breakfast here!

A MUST HOLLA!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from out of town. What a nice little breakfast for 1! The staff was exceptionally warm and welcoming - shout out to Kathy, Kat, Shawn and the host for making my $12 breakfast experience so special. I ordered the veggie breakfast wrap which was SO yummy, huge portion,  amazing tortilla + the salsa was good enough to eat on its own. Everything is fresh and made in-house. They were very accommodating - gave me black ice coffee per my request (usually comes prepared in a batch with milk and sugar). I'm going to make this a regular visit when I'm in town. Affordable, great service, excellent food. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Must visit for breakfast when in Las Vegas. Gets packed so plan for 30 minute wait. Everyone is super friendly and place is well run so the tables turnover quickly.

It's far off the strip, you need to taxi or Uber. Cannot walk. It's straight down from Mandalay Bay, about 1 mile off strip.

We had an omelette and pancake stack.  The omelette is large (4 eggs) and was delicious, I highly recommend. The pancakes are home made and gigantic. No joke, the full stack of 3 pancakes was over 2 inch's thick and larger then the plate. My son is 17 and always finishes his meal, he could not finish.  Must order.  Only downside on pancakes is the come plane - no option for banana or chocolate chips on menu.

This is a MUST visit while in Vegas.

Very reasonable prices compared to the breakfast places on the strip. Your food bill savings offset the taxi fare. 

Again - not to be missed."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mr Mama's for years and am always taken care of very well! They are always very attentive to all customers needs. Nick always talking to customers and making sure all is well Julie is my favorite server and she actually remembers my order and is always right on.Would highly recommend for good home cooking like mom always made!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here when we were heading back home to Cali. Let me tell you the food was amazing. Chicken fried steak was so yummy but not so sure about the gravy. Wasn't my favorite so I just had it on the side and it wasn't hot(temp) enough for me. Coffee was good and hell even the water was good with the crunch ice they use. It's my favorite! I gotta have my ice. Will definitely be a regular stop when we come to Vegas! Pancakes were huge also! Just great portions even to share especially 3 eggs with my chicken fried steak! Just so yummy. Staff and owners were all amazing also! Thank you for such great service!"}
{"text":"Big ups to the dude from san fernando valley that made us felt welcomed and taken care of. I forgot his name"}
{"text":"Went to Mr Mamas for breakfast and I fell in love with their customer service! Their pancakes are huge and their food was great."}
{"text":"The Benedict is amazing!! One of the best I have had! Yummy! Busy place but they keep things rolling and it goes quickly!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp. We took an Uber from the Venitian and it seemed like a long drive by a lot of places. We were hungry and expectations were rising. 

We arrived, the door was opened for us, and we were welcomed in. The place was clean, spacious, well lit and fairly quiet. A good atmosphere if you ask me.

Our server, Jasmine, was pleasant and helpful. Nick, Mr. Mamma himself, stopped by, too. The service was great.

I had the party melt and onion rings. They came out hot and tasty. My vegetarian friend had Mamma's Breakfast Burrito, they were accommodating and replaced the meat with avocado. He also tried the French toast. Everything was well presented, a good temperature and flavorful.

I'd recommend Mr. Mamma's. The only negative thing I can say is that it takes 10 minutes to get there, but it's certainly worth the wait."}
{"text":"I loves me some breakfast anytime of the day!  And Mr. Mama's delivered! 

Had the pleasure of ordering the California omelet with hash browns, my father ordered the steak and eggs, and my kids had the french toast. I loved every bit of it!! Omelet was huge and hash browns were crunchy and fresh the way all hash browns should be! My father's steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. 

Service was great but, the wait to sit was kind of a long wait! The waiter was very apologetic and sincere about it. I guess when it's great food you should expect it to be busy so we did not mind at all. One of the best breakfast I have had!!! Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! I'm a local who wanted to try something new. Read the reviews and thought this has to be good. Loooong wait which would be fine, but there were 6 empty tables. A group of 9 that arrived after us was seated and served drinks before my group of two. Hostess was running around talking to guests and servers, took several minutes just to flag her down. So I'm like ok - food is gonna be amazing right? Nope. Hubby sent home fries back cause they were cold and they brought a second one back cold. They tried to make it better by comp'ing part of my meal, but it was just too little too late.  This local will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is such a little gem in Vegas! Ate here for breakfast on our way back home and everyone was so sweet. The food was out so quick and Kat even brought us complimentary deep fried French toast for waiting and omg it was delicious! And when we left a lovely man brought us a bunch of little Hershey's Kisses with out check. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"I understand Mr. Mamas has very high ratings on yelp. So we decided to come try it out this morning. 

The staff said the wait would be 30-40 minutes to get a table. After about 50 minutes my boyfriend walked back inside and asked if the table was ready and to the left there were 4 empty tables and she said just to pick which one we wanted to sit at. 

We go ahead and sit down and the waitress immediately too our drink our.

However, as we waited for the drinks I was looking around and noticed a girl walked in and told Kat she is a Yelper. They sat her down and waited on her hand and foot and didn't even noticed we were at the next table. This really bothered me because everyone should be treated equal. Yes, you might have gave them \"amazing\" customer service but you lacked on a great chance to give that to another customer as well. 
 
The staff was awesome at getting our food out quickly and man it was delicious!! The Pico De Gallo was to die for! My boyfriend didn't like the pancakes at all and he really upset about it. Especially because we waited so long and he saw me getting so upset about the customer service. 

I guess next time I go in I should just say I Yelp and I'll get treated like a queen. ?"}
{"text":"My family of four went to Mr. Mama's three out of the four days while on our Vegas Vacation. Great family atmosphere and delicious food. The pancakes are jaw dropping huge and good too."}
{"text":"Their chicken fried steak is on its own level. Amazing food. Me and my wife loved it. We will be back."}
{"text":"The owner of Mr Mamas is the reason this restaurant is so highly rated. It had to be the best run restaurant I have ever seen. He is amazing to watch, a \"conductor\". The service is beyond 5 star. I would go back again anytime I am in Vegas because of the service. The food was good and very reasonably priced (I personally did not like the house fries. They lacked flavor). But hands down, amazing atmosphere. Great job Mr. Mama!"}
{"text":"Omg the best breakfast and cheap breakfast I had ever have! Omelet was perfect I've never had such good omelet in a long time and this place is on point! Even with the morning rush, they still have the best customer service! If you think of having pancake I prefer you eat one lol as I thought it'll be a small pancake I ordered a stack with my omelet and let me tell you I've wasted it hahaha! But the food was sooooooo good I'd defensively tell my friends and family about this breakfast joint! Thank you for such great experience"}
{"text":"I arrived I think on Saturday morning and I was gonna hit breakfast here but the wait was so long so we waited to come back Monday and it wasn't as bad.  The service is really friendly and nice.  Its a typical breakfast joint, but with excellent service and good tasting food.

The pancakes were delicious and the strawberries were really fresh.  The bacon was cooked perfectly and overall I had a great experience.  Its located in a busy complex but there are plenty of parking.  

The inside looks spacious though if they are busy I can definitely see this becoming a packed house.  Overall great food and great environment, this is the place to grab breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and I can honestly say their service and food has been very consistent.  While we were still in the parking lot the owner came out, greeted and opened the door for us, which was a very nice gesture.  As for the food, I always get the chicken fried steak and it is always delicious.  The batter is nice, crispy and adheres to the steak well.  The meat is also very tender.  The country style sausage gravy is creamy and has the perfect consistency with chunks of sausage.   It definitely tastes better than most of other breakfast joints.  My wife has tried their omelettes and they are always flavorful and fresh tasting.  Their prices are also a little cheaper than other breakfast places which is another plus and with their $15 for $30 yelp deal you can not beat it.  Will definitely be coming back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Alex was our waiter, awesome guy!  The food was fresh and plentiful.  I loved the fact that being an alum of UofM there was a sign on the wall from there!  Wolverines rock. Near the pop machine was a Red Wings banner.  A slice of home out here in the desert.  I would recommend this establishment very highly!"}
{"text":"What a great place !!! The food was not good!! It was DELICIOUS our first time here we waited about 30 minutes cause the place is very popular great service clean place very professional John took some cool pics !!! One of those places makes you want to come back again for sure  A++++ great job guys"}
{"text":"Customer service here is phenomenal:) definitely my favorite breakfast joint! They make you feel so welcomed and there is never a problem with my order"}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is a Family Style Breakfast and Lunch Restaurant, Nick the owner is always greeting patrons with a smile, and the staff are dynamite in their customer service! I've made MR MAMAS a regular eating destination for breakfast! All of the regular breakfast and lunch items such as bacon and eggs, and toast of your choice, unlimited coffee(YUM), Pancakes, Sausage and Gravy, Homemade corned beef and hash, all kinds of omelets to choose from ... I like the Spanish Omelet myself with mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, spinach, topped with avocado..... Ok my mouth is watering right now, Lol! Come check this place out.... You will definitely leave here Happy..... I guarantee you will not be disappointed! I'm having coffee today, excellent!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Everything here is great, the food, the staff, the coffee, the selections, I mean EVERYTHING! Everyone here is so nice, funny and exceed all expectations. The food is amazing, I have yet to receive something I didn't like. Although I do not live in Vegas, how I wish I had a Mr. Mama's in southern California. I would be there all the time.
The gravy is a must. Whether it be right on your entrée or on the side, the maple syrup, bacon, sausage concoction is the best thing ever. The biscuits are freaking great, very buttery, not too dry. I'm a breakfast person so I have yet to order a lunch item, but I'm sure they do not disappoint. Expect a wait for greatness here. Party of 6 waited for about 40 minutes, but it was well worth it. LOVE MR. MAMAS!!"}
{"text":"We came to eat here because of Lourdes, one of your wonderful waitresses. We trust her recommendations because she has been our regular server for over 8 years. She recommended your place as a new breakfast/lunch place since she wasn't at our old place that we always visited when family was in town for the NASCAR weekend. Boy were we glad we came!!
First impressions are everything! Busy but personal attention. Greeted like we're family, and that was before Shawn knew how we came to visit your place. Everyone was very nice! Our glasses were never empty. Food was amazing and the portions were a lot larger than anywhere we have ever been. My husband and family haven't stopped raving about the biscuits and gravy! Heaven on a fork...lol
Great experience!"}
{"text":"I was expecting to be disappointed because we all know that when a place has 5 stars we end up wondering why? But not this place, it lived up to the hype. Yea it's just a typical breakfast/brunch set up but the food was really good. Chicken fried steak was plate licking good. Hash browns were delicious like actually seasoned and fresh. Somehow the eggs were creamy? In a good way I don't know how to explain it, even the toast was better than average. Not sure what they put in their food but it gets ppl hooked because the line is usually out the door. The service was above and beyond, super friendly and accommodating, funny when u see them tuff looking guys with tattoos but just great customer service. I guess the only dislike was the cinnamon bun, maybe I was expecting cinnabuns lol but wasn't bad. Home fries were ok, I'd stick with hash browns u won't be disappointed. I'd say all the savory foods were amazing and the sweet stuff (French toast, cinnamon roll) were alright. Coffee is good too. Just try it you'll see..."}
{"text":"Yummm stopped while in town based on yelp reviews. Corn beef hash is really good as was the Benedict. Nice local place and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food absolutely amazing!!!! This place is the MOST friendly, comforting and heart-warming establishment:) Highly recommend this stop to fill your tummy and warm your soul!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is even better! The owner is SO NICE and personable. He goes around and checks on every table and makes sure everything is going well. He always has a smile on his face and is super welcoming and is sure to talk to everyone and help them out. It really makes the restaurant stand out!"}
{"text":"Can't give this place enough stars. As soon as you walk in, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic. The owner is super genuinely nice and makes you feel comfortable as soon as he opens the door. I usually don't rate places but I have to with this one. The pancakes are immense and delicious!  Ordered 2...ate 1. My husband loved the western omlette and all the sides. Recommend 100% and will be back any time we visit. You won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Best service I've been to in a while..food and servers was awesome...get here for a good breakfast...family feeling with the kids and outstanding service....come see Jenna and Shawn!!! Awesome peeps"}
{"text":"This is a very good place for breakfast, I am very glad we came. Everyone was very nice. And the place was very clean. 
I got the Spanish omelette with cheese, spinach, and avocado on top, hashbrowns, and toast.
Wife got the pancake, and was very happy when they had peanut butter. 
We had to try the biscuits and gravy, it was the best I have had. 
All the food was made very well and tasty. 
I can see sometimes the parking would be a issue, but for a weekday it was fine.
This will be our spot when in Vegas."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the manager greats you and the owner walks around thanking everyone couldn't ask for a better place to have breakfast with my family. Love that they are constantly moving people in and out you don't wait much. I am for sure coming back for more and the food is great with 1plate you can feed two."}
{"text":"Breakfast was in order the day I visited this fairly new eatery. I came with a friend and he ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, and I ordered the Marty Wrap which came with scrambled eggs, potatoes, pepper jack cheese, avocado, tomato, garlic, and bacon, but I axed the potatoes, all for $7.25. The wrap came with a side of house made salsa.

The wrap was quite good and came tightly wrapped in a flour tortilla. The scrambled eggs were very good, but the bacon was not only plentiful, but had a great texture and flavor. I enjoyed it very much and it was present in every bite, the way it should be. The avocado was just ripe and creamy, the tomatoes added a nice acidity, and the garlic flavor was very mild. Oh yes, it would of been nice if it had more cheese because I would of liked to have seen it oozing out. 

The side of salsa was great. It did not provide much heat, but what it lacked in heat, it made up in flavor. It was zesty, with a garlic flavor, and spot on seasoning. Pouring into the wrap as I ate it, was the ticket. Good stuff...

Service was quite good and our server was friendly and prompt. However I truly appreciated when the floor manager came over to check on us several times and participated in small talk. She was quite genuine."}
{"text":"You get a good amount of food for what you pay. Mom and pop shop with down to earth people. My mom and I shared an omelette and one French toast and it was plenty of food. The o letters are made of four eggs each so they're pretty big. The place is clean and there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast/lunch place that wont break the bank. And I mean, VERY affordable. Big plates, delicious food. We were a party of 3 adult males and spent under $50 (total for all) and could barely walk after because of the amount of good food you get. Staff is extremely friendly and nice, the owner who greets every guest at the door is a very cool guy who clearly loves his restaurant and respects his guests. We went there twice for breakfast, been served by Denise the first time and by Nordes the second time. Thank you girls for the amazing service and great food! Oh, if you like eggs benedict you should try it here, it's unmatched. I had mine with steak and boy, it was good. Also tried the omelette with salsa, sour cream and avocado that Nordes recommended and it was delicious. Anyway, if I ever go to Vegas again I'm going to Mr. Mamas for another breakfast, no doubt!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is bomb.... i came for 3 days straight.... and tried different things every time.... also the customer service was on point super friendly and very helpful... my food was hot and my cups always filled..."}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast here during our short stay in Las Vegas. Worth the drive. Pancakes and French toast are execellent.
Something different than the massive breakfast locations"}
{"text":"Was drawn to this restaurant for the sausage and gravy biscuits. The gravy was amazing but the biscuits were a bit dry. Service was excellent which made up for it."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place. I tried the veggie omelette it was so flavorful and right quantity. We had to wait 15 mins on a Monday morning, worth every minute. Staff is good and friendly."}
{"text":"Although I love to read reviews on yelp and will take reviews into account when considering trying a new place for just about anything; I don't really ever write reviews. But for Mr. Mama a 5 star review it is well deserved. One of the many great things about this place is consistency. The food is always great. Service-always 5 stars. Mr. Mama himself is always there and always takes the time to connect with every customer to make sure their experience was nothing but the best. The servers and bus boys are fantastic. Always friendly and on top of clearing your table. Lastly, prices- very reasonable."}
{"text":"Superb breakfast spot. 5 stars for everything! Cleanliness, check. Great coffee, check. Crispy hash browns, check. Great service, check. And last but not least, my personal benchmark for a go to breakfast joint, great chicken fried steak, check!!! Believe the hype.  Legit. Solid. Killer. Bomb. Call it whatever you want and just f'ing go!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and tasty.  They have the fluffiest pancakes I have ever had.  My family loves going here.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"First of all their customer service is amazing. I absolutely loved being there. I got to meet the owner he came up to us and introduced himself to us also he even told us a joke. Overall my experience was great I loved it will always go there once I'm back in Vegas"}
{"text":"One of the cleanest and friendliest diners I've ever visited. Service was impeccable, everyone made us feel like family. The food was on point. The eggs benedict was perfect, and the giant pancakes were to die for.  Don't hesitate..get here ASAP!"}
{"text":"Been on the hunt for the best breakfast spot in Vegas and Mr.Mamas is inarguably one of my favorite breakfast spot in town. I came here on a Saturday morning and place was bustling with people which is a good sign. 

Service was impeccable. One of the guy (owner?) opened the door for us as we were walking towards the entrance with a warm greeting. Place was packed but they got more than enough servers to take care of everyone. A lady came by our table and introduced herself, I'm assuming she is also the owner? Her name was something along the line of Katherine or Kathy (why am I so bad with names...smh),  I can't remember but she was extremely friendly and welcoming. 

I was craving something sweet so I ordered their Mama's French Toast, which comes with 5 generous slices of toast with 3 eggs, and a choice of sausage/ham/bacon. French toast was dusted with powdered sugar but did not have any sweetness to itself. I put maple syrup to sweeten up the toast a little but quickly realized their maple syrup is not sweet at all.

Toasts were rather dry and the dish overall was forgettable. Bacon was crispy and eggs were cooked to my liking. 

In conclusion, I would give 3 stars for the food itself but based on their top-notch service, I am bumping it up to 4 stars. Thank you and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! The menu says it all! They greet you when you come in and put a smile on your face till you leave. Great service & good food for a reasonable price!  All the workers were very nice. The owner even comes out to greet the customers. Love their philosophy where they make you feel at home and like your family.


Updated review- 
We came back again a day after. Our friends just came in from Hawaii and brought our friends here for breakfast. They loved it! Thank you Mr. Mamas & staff for accommodating us. You guys are awesome! Always great service & good food."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and nice service. But not a very family friendly atmosphere. We usually go to Black Bear Diner for breakfast, but decided to try this place based off the reviews. Much prefer the atmosphere at Black Bear, as well as the fresh squeezed orange juice and sweet cream pancakes. My husband usually gets lunch, and he said Mr. Mamas has a better Rueben thank Black Bear, but still not as good as Goodwhich. Good, but not great. We will be sticking with Blackbear, as nothing particularly stands out here."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents for brunch on Christmas Eve. The owner (maybe manager?) here displays such an affection for and commitment to his customers - it stands out and almost cannot go unnoticed. We were greeted as soon as walked in and to the right of us were a slew of other customers waiting to be seated. \"Is it just the three of you?... The wait is going to be around 15 minutes, but most likely shorter, is that okay?\" YES. He answered my question without me even asking, and we were seated in less than ten minutes. BROWNIE POINTSSS

The portions are generous- we ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine, the Chicken Fried Steak w/ gravy and Eggs, and a side of pancakes to share among the three of us and could not finish. The servers are on point and so polite.

What a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with a warm welcome at the door by the owner, Nick. This place was amazing. The food, the ambiance, all the staff was truly over-the-top. We are staying on the strip, but the 10 minute ride was well worth it. Generous portions of delicious food. Will definitely come back! Best of luck, Nick!  Fantastique!"}
{"text":"We love it here!   Fairly close to the house, excellent service, friendly staff, delicious food and very good coffee.

Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Picked this place based on yelp rating and me and my family wasn't disappointed everything was awesomely good I had eggs country ham and bacon everything was perfect very friendly staff from the moment u walk in and the owner walks around telling jokes very cool place highly recommend"}
{"text":"Generous portions, friendly service, good prices. Next time we're in Vegas we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten from here three times now. Always bring the food home cuz I live close by. French toast is thick, large sausage patties, delish! The western omelette is flavorful and hash browns are crunchy as I like them. Friendly service, order is always ready for pick up within 10 min. Definitely recommend trying Mr. Mamas"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and service was the same! It's worth the drive as its off the beaten path.. The owner was very friendly.  It was clean, food was fresh, pancakes are made by scratch.. Omelettes are made with 4 eggs.. Hashbrowns were perfect! The owner said we look fit..  said the portions are meant to fatten us up..  thanks mr mama!"}
{"text":"Very good and the owner was walking around making sure everything was fine, don't see that very often."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic customer service! From the moment you are greeted at the door you feel like a VIP! We are definitely returning back...tomorrow"}
{"text":"Mr Mama's has amazing food and service! From the opening of our door to the little amount of time we waited for our food. Everyone is upbeat and so polite! And the food is great!"}
{"text":"Yep, Yelp brought us here and did not disappoint! The food is great! And cheap! Yummy pancakes, eggs, hash browns, and bacon. My husband and I ate a feast with 2 coffees for ~$20. On top of the food and prices, it is really a great atmosphere. All the workers are so sweet and you can see them all really helping each other out. The owner was constantly making rounds thanking guests and helping the staff. He has really created an awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"You cannot miss this place if you are in Vegas.
Food was delicious, super-duper hospitality and energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whenever someone asks me to grab breakfast, I always suggest to go to Mr. Mama's. HUGE portions, wallet friendly, and great service. I don't know what else you could possibly ask more from them. 

As soon as I was walking up to the entrance, a server immediately opened the door for me before I even had to chance to grab on the the door handle. From then on, I knew I was going to love this place. 

I wasn't wrong. They got me hooked with the food. I was able to try the choice of meat and eggs as well as the breakfast egg sandwich. Yes, I am aware that the choice of meat and eggs entree is just the deconstructed version of the sandwich BUT STILL, both are so good. 

Absolutely delicious! Great place for anyone looking for a traditional style breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here based off of reviews and because we were trying to get away from the strip and it did not disappoint!

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with friendly smiles! The waitress, Lourdes, I believe recommended the chicken fried steak, Cali omelette, and corned beef hash. She even said that they can give you samples so you can try it, which is awesome! We need up getting the corned beef hash, chicken fried steak, and biscuits and gravy...all of them were DELICIOUS! On top of that, the customer service here is on point which always brings me back no matter how the food is! Thank you Mr. Mamas, we will definitely be back the next time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"With over 2,000 reviews and a solid 4.5 star average, it's obvious that Mr Mamas is doing something right! I personally think this is one of if not THE best spot to have breakfast in town. It's not fine dining, just a casual diner with some delicious grub. 

I was a customer of the original Mr Mamas when they were located in a much smaller building on Decatur. The new location is so much nicer, but the word is out about this spot... there is almost always a wait to be seated. The employees here are efficent and get food out and tables cleared quickly.  

Service in general is just excellent... Mr Mama himself regularly stops by tables to see how people are doing, what a charming man he is! Every member of the staff I have interacted with has been friendly and I honestly feel like my patronage is appreciated when I eat here. 

Stand outs on the menu for me are the Marty wrap, the french toast and I love their home fries. Don't skip the cinnamon roll, it's delicious.

{"text":"Happy Food, Happy Dude!  

That should be everybody's motto. I'm one happy dude when I'm served good food with great service. It's no secret.  Mr. Mamas is a very popular spot in Las Vegas for breakfast.  There's usually a wait because the whole town loves this place.  Mr. Mamas is not just a local favorite, tourist and travelers come here too.  You'll even count the amount of cars with California, Arizona, and Utah license plates in the parking lot. The Manager stated that over 65% of their customers during the weekend come from California.  That's amazing considering that Mr. Mamas is not even on the strip.  

I first experienced Mr. Mamas a couple of years ago and what sticks out the most is their excellent customer service.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I'm not the only person that mentions the A++ service here.  There hasn't been one time, not one, when I ever touched the door.  Someone from Mr. Mamas, usually the Manager Shawn, opens the door as I walk in and walk out.  Shawn leads by example and his enthusiasm towards his customers is also duplicated by the employees here.  It's guaranteed at Mr. Mamas that you will be welcomed on the way in, checked on during your meal, and greeted on the way out. And if you're getting coffee, don't worry about staying caffeinated.  They are like ninjas here and will top off your cup without you even noticing.  Ordering is simple and fast.  Getting your food is even faster.  But don't let their speediness discourage you from staying and chilling out.  Mr. Mamas encourages you to enjoy your meal at your pace and will never rush you.  I really can't say enough about the customer service at Mr. Mamas.  Their commitment to their guest is as good as it gets. 

As for the food, I don't get too creative when I have breakfast. I'll usually stick to their eggs, bacon, toast, more eggs, and maybe a breakfast steak.  Every once in a while, I'll get their oatmeal or a short stack when my body craves it.  By the way, their hash browns extra crispy is dangerously good.  Bottom line, the food has always been awesome.  When the service is great, the food tends to taste even better.  Overall, I know what I'm going to get when it comes to Mr. Mamas and that's a good All-American breakfast with a side of excellent customer service. Thank You!

We ordered the chicken fried steak and California omelette.  Both meals were hearty and delicious. The pancake was also large, fluffy and tasty. One of the employees was kind enough to offer a photo of us.  He used our smartphone and precariously stood on a chair and snapped off a photo for us to remember our amazing experience at Mr. Mamas."}

Weekdays usually are slower but weekends yeah really packed at least 30 minute wait. Our waitress was Kathy she was a really sweet young pretty girl! She refilled our waters whenever needed and also made sure we had everything we needed. The food came right away and wow was it good. Probably best breakfast place I've had in Vegas. She was really a great waitress also I appreciated how kind she was! Props to Kathy and the whole crew for being amazing and making me have a wonderful experience with amazing food. New obsession! They'll be seeing me a lot."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning with my husband and son. The food was amazing and the service was excellent!  They made you feel welcome and part of the family!  Definitely a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Love the food, the service, and the environment. I tried this place once on a limb and have been happily coming back ever since.  I can't imagine how anyone could have complaints about this place, but there are always those that want to complain. 
The owner seriously does way more for the restaurant than you would expect an owner to do.  Talks to each table, inspects the cleanliness at all times, and even cleans up himself in order for his staff to focus only on the customer service, I assume."}
{"text":"Hash Browns!
That's it; they make it like it should be made - with butter, crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. 

Thier eggs are good too. 
I was just there for a quick breakfast before work and order takeaway of the 2 egg breakfast. I made an egg sandwich with the whole wheat toast and savored the hash browns by itself. Delicious. Now i'm thinking about Breakfast for Dinner!!"}
{"text":"Found this spot on a trip to Vegas with some friends. We wanted a good and filling breakfast but off the strip so it wouldn't be so packed. We found this place on yelp and gave it a shot. While it was crowded, we waited less then 15 min to seated. The food was delicious and just what we were looking for. I ordered the cheese and egg sandwich and it was very good, my boyfriend and friends ordered other plates like the breakfast burrito and chicken and all of us were satisfied with our food. The staff was incredibly friendly and checked in on us often to make sure we were good with food and drinks. The icing on the cake was the price, much cheaper then what we would have gotten on the strip. Would definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here, friend said the chicken fried steak with sausage gravy is worth checking out. Came in for breakfast and shared the plate. Gravy is so good, super chunky with country sausage and just the right seasoning so it's not too salty. We orderedneorh home fries and eggs over easy. We chose the buttermilk biscuit with a side of extra gravy, the biscuit comes grilled with maple syrup butter! So good. Glad I came here for breakfast can't wait to try other items!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service with a smile! Pancakes are light and flavorful, bacon is crispy with a smoky finish, their eggs and omelets are light and perfectly cooked. Condiments are properly cleaned. This is the cleanest, most friendly restaurant with food that is pure heaven in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak. Man, it was pure deliciousness! Plates are about $10 and big serving size. Service is great; our waitress took care of us. Never felt rushed  even though they were busy. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I was hesitate at first if this restaurant really worth 5 stars. It turns out that it is! The foods are great and the services are good too. I can say it is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. We are from Hawai'i and I when I read about this place I had to try it. We are food critics and we try anything. Drove about 10 mins from The Luxor, real easy to find. Wasnt crowded, a gentleman opened the door for us and greeted us with a smile and a joke hahaha. Cool guy. Ambience was perfect. Sit anywhere you want. Everything clean and the best part? Someone is a Denver Broncos fan! Waitress was very courteous, ensured our coffee were filled. I ordered the Marty wrap which includes eggs cheese bacon avocado onions tomato. The portion was huge. The quality was almost on point. Eggs fluffy, cheese just right. The only draw back was the bacon. Wasnt much of it. Shouldnt been diced, should be long length, avocado wasnt enough, only on one half of the wrap. But it was delicious. The hubby had mushroom and cheese omelet. It was massive. Hashbrown were perfectly crisp on the outside. Fabulous. All in all it was well recommended. Loved it and it will be on my list again when we return to Vegas, which is often....ALOHA"}
{"text":"I came to their old location on Decatur long ago. Great service. Great food. Wonderful service. I recently went to their current location on Jones and Russell. Yes people, it is possible that a place can get better from near perfect. The last location was narrow and tight, but still cozy. New location opened up a bit and the service is wonderful as always. The best part of the whole place is Nick the crown and jewel of Mr.Mamas. Say \"hello\" he will be glad you did :) 5-Stars!"}
{"text":"We got the Janna Wrap and side of hashbrowns.  Both were light and delicious!!!  Loved the cofee.  Great service too!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the great service and great food!!
It was a pleasure to meet the owner thank you for coming up to us  your food is delicious"}
{"text":"This is a local breakfast and lunch place.  It is off the beaten path and busy. There are many wait staff and kitchen appears to be well staffed.  The staff is courteous and friendly. The wait on the breakfast order was short.  Howard's french toast with ham was good.  I ordered half order of the biscuits and gravy.  The gravy us tasty but could have been warmer.  The biscuit was grilled before adding the gravy.  It was dry. The gravy flavour was outstanding.  I saw many tasty looking menu items being served.  It is worth the trip to try this place. Would suggest they find a different recipe for the biscuits and maybe not quite so thick gravy.  Do come here and try your favorites."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best breakfast place in Las Vegas.  Nick the owner always greet you with a warm smile.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and great.  The food is awesome.   I am currently hooked on the chicken fried steak with the sausage gravy.  They have moved to a larger location to accommodate the crowds because the word is out about Mr. Mama's.  This a gem of a place because the food is awesome and a local business owner that is truly appreciative for your business!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here 12/2017, food was good, BUT the coffee was way too weak!  I'm big on coffee, I can have it on every meal, but most especially for breakfast I have to have a good cup of coffee. The coffee was good flavor but just way way too weak. To me it doesn't have to be Starbucks strong, but at the same time it should not look like it's watered down. 2 stars just because of the coffee."}
{"text":"Food is great. It's clean, but the biggest plus here is their service. If you're really hungry and can eat a lot order the mamas stack. For us normal eaters the half stack it perfect. I ordered the full stack and couldn't eat it all."}
{"text":"The day after we arrived in Las Vegas for vacation, we went here for breakfast. The service was outstanding, the food was great, the owners personally greeted everybody who came in the door. We enjoyed it so much we came back again several days later for lunch, where we again ordered breakfast! Once again excellent service, great food, and the owner recognized us from our previous visit. We had chicken fried steak and omelettes, made perfectly to order. The chicken fried steak comes with a sausage gravy that is kind of unique and unite delicious. All of our food was great. Our servers on both occasions were friendly and attentive. And you cannot beat the personal touch you get in this restaurant. We will definitely try to visit here at least once every time we come to Las Vegas. Everyone should try this place and be impressed."}
{"text":"Mr Mama's is a great, laid back, comfortable breakfast spot with wonderful customer service and yummy big plates of food! I had the chicken fried steak and eggs meal and it was SOO filling. Their unique hospitality sets them apart from other diner type restaurants. 
Claudia our waitress was SO wonderful! Kat the Manager was very friendly and great too. 

Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Like eating at my mamas house chicken fried steak and the service is worth of a 5 star review  LAS VEGAS"}
{"text":"Wanted to have breakfast off the strip and my wife was directed to Mr Mamas by google. Very awesome place for breakfast. They open from 6am - 3pm m-f and 7am - 2pm sat-sun. Was going by to order the chili/cheese burger but upon ordering her homemade corned beef hash, our server commented that that was a very good choice and her favorite dish. Once I heard that I ordered the same thing. Their corned beef is actually homemade and one of the best I've ever had. Free refills for coffee and hot tea are available. Props to Lourdes for the awesome, sincere, and genuine service provided to us. If you are in the mood for a great breakfast at very reasonable prices visit Mr Mamas; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas with some friends and she recommended this place and man I'm glad she did! Awesome service and amazing food! Highly recommended. Portions are huge so we shared an omelette and French toast and left happy and stuffed. Will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"As far as breakfast joints go, this place was very yummy. The prices were quite low, while the quality was top notch. Service was good as well. The eggs Benedict was fantastic as well as the French toast. I will definitely be back another morning!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas offers solid no frills breakfast for cheap prices.  The inside is decorated with a checkerboard pattern tile floor with plain black chairs and tables, the place was immaculately clean.  We were instantly greeted and seated.  The service we received from start to finish was friendly and efficient.

We ordered:
-French Toast with Bacon ($7.75) - Comes with two slices of French toast, the French toast was tasty and wasn't overly soggy either which I appreciate.  The server asked if I wanted my bacon crispy or soggy, I love that they ask you this and give you the option!  I opted for crispy and it was delicious. 
-Two Eggs and Toast with Sausage Patties ($6.95) - I'm still impressed with how cheap this dish was!  You can pick between bacon, sausage patties, or ham.  My friend opted for the sausage patties.  You also get a choice of toast and hash browns/home fries.  I was able to steal some home fries off my friend's plate and honestly thought it was just okay, didn't eat anything else of theirs.
-Cinnamon Roll (forgot the price!) - Either my friend and I are dummies for not being able to find this on their menu or it wasn't listed on their menu.  We asked our server about it and she put the order in for us no problem.  Man this beats cinnabon over the head.  Warm, fluffy, sweet, and delicious nothing more I could ask for.    

I'm a little sad that Mr. Mamas isn't closer to me, if I'm ever in that area of town I'll definitely grab breakfast here!"}
{"text":"This place serves great tasting food for the price.  Will definitely come back.  Very friendly and attentive staff and the owner is awesome too.  Makes you feel very welcome and at home!"}
{"text":"Nick, the owner greets you at the door. Might have to wait 15-20 minutes, but the food is good. Everyone was real nice."}
{"text":"Really good place to get some breakfast and low price! Originally we had ordered a medium rare-steak and eggs and we got it well done. I'm not a picky eater but they still went ahead and offered a new one, with a cinnamon roll!"}
{"text":"The epitome of great service is knowing how to interact with people and to be an honest and genuine representative of ones  company.  Nick (Mr. Mama himself) presented a very pleasant greeting the second we walked in.  For vegas, that's difficult to find.  The staff seemed very pleasant.  As I noticed nick interacting with other customers,  he, as well as the staff were genuine and very nice. 


The food was very good.  I had the Manhattan burger and I was very satisfied.  I do wish I ordered the corned beef hash as I found later that it looked really good and that its home made.  My girl ordered the French toast.  She was also happy with the flavor and portions. 

I will undoubtably recommend this establishment to all friends and family coming here.  And I will return to this place time and time again every time I visit vegas.  Hands down, best breakfast/lunch place I've ever ate at."}
{"text":"Omg  we literally just ran into this place and were SO happy to find it! The food is great, plentiful, but the best part is the service and welcoming feeling. Jenna, the owner's daughter, was our server, and she was simply delightful. We asked her about the wrap on the menu named after her, and she told us the back story. Sean went around taking pics of folk and making us feel super welcomed. Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE ever!! I have tried from breakfast burrito to the avocado beacon sandwiches and boy!! Wasn't that delicious!!! I highly recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Unmatched Excellence...Don't miss out on this Home away from Home.

Very Sincerely and Respectfully,"}
{"text":"Came back and the owner was not barking orders at the door. He let the brunette waitress do her job, and she does fantastically at it. She manages the floor without yelling over customers heads. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Make sure you stop by!! This is a hidden neighborhood GEM!! I would suggest anything from the breakfast menu.. I wish they were Open Later in the Day.. Maybe offer delivery service in the near future?  Great Staff and great Food!!!"}
{"text":"German below.

Been there a couple of Times. Last time back in 2014, but I can remember how good it was. Everything was right on the spot! Mr. Mama (Is that how they call him?) Could still remember my name 2 days after I visited and that is a perfect example of good customer service!
 
5 Stars for the food and another 5 Stars for the staff! 
I will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas again!

Ich war mittlerweile schon ein paar mal da! Wir hatten das erste mal Omelett bestellt und da es so perfekt war dachten wir uns ein paar french toasts können auch nicht schaden. Im großen und ganzen wird hier alles perfekt zubereitet! Was auch ein großartiges Plus ist, ist der Fakt das der Chef selber einen großen Wert auf Kundenzufriedenheit legt. Zwei Tage nach meinem ersten Besuch habe ich mich beschlossen Mr.Mama noch einmal einen Besuch abzustatten. Als ich dort ankam wurde ich mit einem \"Daniel welcome back!\" begrüßt was mich zu tiefst beeindruckt hat! 

Besser kann man in Vegas nicht frühstücken!"}
{"text":"Really solid, classic breakfast with excellent service to make our Monday morning that much better. Go with the recommendations here and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Best place I've ever been, the food is extremely amazing, the staff is so friendly and the owner is always talking and taking care of his customers. You need to come over and try their Cali Omelet and the French Toast love them!!!!!!!!!
I don't know what else i can say because there's no words to describe how amazing this place is.
That's why is my favorite place in Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great portions, HUGE pancakes, great staff. I got 2 pancakes with scrambled eggs and ham. Like I said... the pancakes are enormous. They still manage to be cooked perfectly and were tasty. The eggs were cooked nicely and the ham was delicious. All the portions were great."}
{"text":"Pretty great breakfast for the money!
Nice to have a great meal off the strip. The chicken fried steak was a nice change of pace. Loved the omelette too. Service was good and they treated us as if we were locals and that by far was a win in my book!

And u can have breakfast or lunch at the same time!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Everything was fresh, seasoned and reasonably priced. The service was above average. Several managers and servers checked on us and engaged playfully with our little ones. I remember Kat (our manager) and Jenna  (our waitress) by name. We're not from Vegas but this place feels like a down home diner. They had a full house, so prepare for a small wait on weekends. We were seated in 10 minutes, not bad for the crowd and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service.  Wow- so refreshing- great job EVERYONE- If there is a restaurant out there that wants to know how it's done- send them here, watch, listen,  observe.  
The food was fantastic- nothing fancy- no aires, no excuses.  Just a great quality product.  
THANK YOU- I will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, their food is amazing. I am a hash brown fan, and they serve the best ones I've ever had. Service is fast and staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Every person greeted us. Every single person had a warm vibe. We were constantly being checked on by our server. The portions here are incredible! I took half home and ate the rest of it for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has it figured out. From the Super friendly hostess that complemented my wife's dress to the server, customer service is top notch. The food is also excellent. Monday morning at 10:30 and still packed. I wish more business owners would figure out how to really believe in their product!"}
{"text":"Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes. Fluffy, fresh, made from scratch, and delicious! Almost as large as the plate it is served on, definitely filling. Many of the reviews mention the sausage gravy, I found it extremely bland. It tastes like flour. Complete lack of seasoning.. Do yourself a favor and stick with pancakes, bacon, sausage and eggs and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good breakfast! Probably the best in town next to the egg and I.. They have HUGE pancakes that cover the plate so beware! One or two are good IMO with some sides, Bacon, Ham, Sausages etc.. The guy at the door who greets you is VERY COOL and says hi to everybody that walks in.. They have just about everything breakfast item you want! Monday was about a 10-15 minute wait! I can only imagine the weekends could be up to an hour!! But if your close by give this place a try!! Everybody is nice and respectful here! Love it!"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing to special a little disappointed. Portions were not like the pictures out plate were a lot smaller. 

Server she only came over to give me a refill once and to give the check. 

I don't think I would go back wait line is pretty long for a small location and ok quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great service, food tasted great   good size portion on food. Got the steak & eggs,  it was cooked perfect,  i could cut it with my butter knife . Husband got Corn beef and Hash, he liked it. 
Love the new location!"}
{"text":"Great food and hospitality!   The food was very tasty and in generous portions.   We had the french toast with fresh strawberries and the chicken fried steak.  In a city where there's so much focus on The Strip restaurants it was really nice to be able to take a short drive and get some delicious, simply done food.  

The hospitality was a total level up, with a gentleman opening the door as we arrived and thanking us as we departed.  Our waitress was attentive and on top of everything.  It's a rarity to experience this level of sincerity in most places, but it's definitely alive and well here.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast when I'm in Vegas. It's nice that it's a couple miles off the strip so parking is easy and not so crowded. They have great food and great service. The servers, hostesses and managers are all very hard working and make it a nice environment to enjoy breakfast. The wait can be pretty long on weekend mornings but weekdays aren't too bad. Not too expensive the total was about $40 before tip with my group of 3 people. Great place I definitely recommend for anyone looking for breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food and clean establishment...   if you feel like eating away from the strip, this is the spot for breakfast or lunch.   Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge - 2018 #60

Delicious house potatoes and great customer service. 

I stumbled upon Mr. Mamas after an orthodontist appointment and stopped in to try some breakfast . 

The restaurant is attached to a shopping plaza off of Jones and there is plenty of open parking. 

Waking up to the restaurants there is a nice gentleman who opens the door upon entering and exiting for all guest. This same gentleman takes your name and lets you know how long your wait will be. While I was waiting he asked how's your day. You can also get a menu to look over while you wait.

I only waited 3 minutes for my table to be cleaned because I came pretty early in the morning . The menu is a three tier menu and the food options are endless. You can honestly order anything here. I asked my amazing server for suggestions and told her what I wanted and she gave me a delicious combo meal.

I orders sausage, cheese an eggs, house potatoes and a cinnamon bun. 

With a packed restaurant my food didn't take long to come out an it was delicious . The food was so delicious that I wanted to bring my fiancé the next day for lunch so he could try. 

Check it out for some yummy breakfast!!!!
You want be disappointed"}
{"text":"I like breakfast. And this place did not impress. The gravy on your biscuits and gravy and country fried steak... lolz. I almost feel like if there was a gravy religion this would be considered blasphemy... id prefer a false prophet because at least that tastes good. 

Your potato chips... yes potato chips, I know they are called something else but that is what they are except... no salt... no pepper... no special seasonings. Heres a fried potato round. Enjoy?

The eggs were alright, nothing that made me say hey these are a delicious.com. These are more likely to appear on diy.com.  '

There is just nothing here that made me say wow. It seems like a nice establishment and it has a great staff but the food just made me a little sad... like rudolph being shunned by santa sad. 

THE VERDICT: so here is my conspiracy theory... they werent satisfied with there 4.5 star rating so they moved so they could get back up to 5. I realize that my opinion is very much the minority... but I stand by it. PS its really out of the way from the city. Wow... im getting more and more blown away by all the 5 stars... but hey its vegas people are intoxicated so... it makes sense."}
{"text":"btw mr mamas doesn't add salt to their food like all other breakfast places, especially black bear diner. no high blood pressure here. neil lewow"}
{"text":"Dined here few weeks ago. I am not a big fan of American brunch or breakfast. HOWEVER, the customer service was def a plus for me and the fact that they offer egg whites was only totally loveable.i got that their egg white only spanish omelet and my boyfriend got steak. I would not recommend steak (it wasnt what we expected) but still this places desrrves a 5 star"}
{"text":"A quick Uber ride off the strip provided us with one of the best breakfasts I've had in a while. Excellent service and flawless food, Mr. Mamas was every bit worth the Uber fees.

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash topped with scrambled eggs and a side of home style fries and an additional side of bacon.

The eggs were pretty standard but the Corned Beef hash was out of this world good as were the super crispy yet not greasy \"fries\" or cubed potatoes.

The only thing that could have made breakfast any better would have been a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome!! From the food to the service. We got there just in time on Mother's Day before it got a little busy, and it didn't seem like the wait was too long for customers coming in. We came here for breakfast both days we were in Vegas. All the food was awesome, and the service was great!"}
{"text":"It's hard to over embellish about a breakfast, however this spot changes that idea. The food and staff is amazing, we traveled off the strip by word of mouth, glad we did. 

Going back today!! Love it"}
{"text":"Poor customer service to be seated! I understand being busy but customer service means EVERYTHING especially in today's society where people are particular where they spend their money. Yelp you didn't warn me about this."}
{"text":"The first thing my wife noticed was just how clean EVERYTHING is. Silverware, table, floor, EVERYTHING.

Now the food. Wow. I see why they had great reviews. French toast, great. Scrambled eggs, great. Biscuits& gravy? They have their own recipe, and it rocks! I know the secret ingredient, perfect addition-never had it before, I like it.

The wait staff is on full court press, if you need something they have it at your table before you realize you need it.

Any recommendations would be- add a kids menu. The huge portions are two or three kids worth. Only problem, if they did that it would be free, because their prices are already dirt cheap.

Great place, glad yelp sent us here."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday morning and the breakfast was AMAZING!! I ordered the Spanish omelette which had mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, spinach and avocado with a side of potatoes! In my opinion It's the BEST place to have breakfast/lunch in Vegas and I will definitely come back next time I'm here"}
{"text":"Me and my wife ordered the rib eye steak and eggs, and web weren't disappointment. The steak didn't need no A1 sauce, which a truly good made steak shouldn't, and the price is great $10. Great food, service and atmosphere. Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a trade show. I wanted to find a good breakfast place off the strip.  This place was perfect. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs.  Super good, not greasy. Fast service and they kept my coffee filled."}
{"text":"Thanks to YELP we found this place last year and loved it enough to search for the new location!  So worth it!  The owner is super friendly!"}
{"text":"The wait was worth it! The staff were so nice, the host guy is funny and the food was amazing! I ordered the chicken fried steak and a cinnamon roll, both of which I'd recommend. Everything was cooked to perfection. The chicken fried steak was crunchy, the gravy was rich and creamy. The cinnamon roll was so soft and warm. Oh, and the pancakes..yum! They were big and what I liked about them was how light and airy it was instead of dense and hard. I'm planning to come back 10/10 for sure. Just writing this review makes me hungry for more Mr. Mamas!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a locals place for breakfast and found the perfect place. The owner greets you by opening the door and comes by your table to make sure everything is fine. My hubby and I shared an omelet and it was fabulous. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"With the help of Yelp we found this place. We ate there Sept. 14-15, 2016. We were greeted at the door by the manager seated quickly and we had excellent service  and excellent hot food. My water and coffee glass were always full.  The experience was so good we went the next day for breakfast.  They were really busy we had to wait maybe 5-7minutes at most. Because of the high volume the service wasn't as great as it was the day before but it was good.  The first time I had French toast, eggs, and bacon.  The second day I had the steak and eggs. My husband had the three meat omelette both days because he liked it so much.  I wish every place gave such great service. I highly recommend eating there."}
{"text":"Must go!!! The food, service, and price is Great!!! When ever I got to Vegas again, it's a must to come back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Service- 5 stars spectacular. These people are not messing around with making sure you're happy, got your water filled, and satisfied with your food. The GM was checking on everyone and saying hello. What a guy. 

Corned beef hash- 4.5 stars. I've had better, but this is the best corned beef hash I've had in Vegas. 

Country Fried Steak- 4 stars. I wasn't sold on the breading completely, but the steak inside was tender and moist. Great flavors. Comes with sausage gravy, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but it did the job. I got the hash browns on the side EXTRA CRISPY, and they gave me what I wanted. SO FREAKING GOOOD. 

Buttermilk pancakes- 4 stars. Chewy, yummy, good stuff. 

Eggs benedict- 4 stars. It's all in the hollandaise sauce. I've had better, but I'm super picky about my sauces so don't quote me. Go eat here and judge for yourself. 

Overall, this is a great place for brekkie."}
{"text":"Excellent food, world class service!! My friend and I ate  here yesterday and the food was exactly what I was looking for. Perfectly cooked bacon, savory french toast, crispy hash browns, and a gooey cinnamon roll yassss...If you want some legit grub or to cure a massive hangover go to Mr. Mamas. 

Also...shot out to the owner for his world-class customer service! :)

ILOVEVEGAS!!"}
{"text":"We were seated within 30 seconds of arriving, despite it being a busy Sunday morning.

Our table was near the kitchen, and the manager (a nice lady named Kat or Cat) came over, introduced herself, told us our server would be out promptly, and took our drink order.

I had the southern eggs benedict (mini chicken fried steak patties atop English muffins, with the specialty gravy), and the hash browns.

The eggs Benedict dish was ok. It was pretty standard.

The hash browns were light and crispy, without being greasy, just how I love them!

Their gravy is made with bits of sausage, bacon, and a little maple syrup, so there's a little bit of sweetness in there.

Our waitress was a nice lady named Claudia, and she was helpful, nice, and quick with service.

In the background, the manager Kat kept everyone on track and also pitched in as needed, a sign of a great manager.

The restaurant was clean and orderly, despite it being a busy and crowded weekend morning. The tables were bussed quickly, and there appeared to be a very smooth flow - great to see that at an establishment!

I'm giving this place 4 stars, because while the service and restaurant atmosphere was a shining 5, the food itself is only a 4.

Skip the crowded buffets of the Strip for a quieter and more comforting breakfast of Mr Mamas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I travel to Vegas a couple times a year and today was our first time dining at Mr. Mamas and I have to say this is the best breakfast place in Las Vegas.  Mr Mama himself is at the door greeting you with a smile and many compliments (which I loved) the staff was fantastic the service was outstanding!!! This is and will be our new place to dine for breakfast no more hotel buffets we are gong to Mr. Mamas. They also feed you like family style which means their is so much food."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. It was everything i expected. I hax the eggs benidict with sausage... AMAZING. It was my first time eating eggs benidict and im hooked! We also got the steak amd eggs. The steak was fatty but thats ok because we like the fat :) Our server Alex was so sweet. He was attentive and on top of everything. Needless to say the food was delicious i cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I come to LV 4-5 times a year from SoCal and am always on the lookout for new places to eat. Thanks to Yelp, I stumbled on this gem.
The friendliness and service begins before you walk in the door. The owner (Nick) and staff were very accommodating and welcoming.  I got the distinct impression that people actually LIKE working there.

Now for the breakfast fare. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs like many Yelpers recommended and it did not disappoint. 
No need for the steak knife as you can cut it with your fork. 
My server (didn't catch her name ) offered a sample of the gravy before the breakfast order was sent to the kitchen; nice touch.

With countless options around town, this ranks right up there with Jamm's etc. I never made it to their old location, but this one seats almost double and there are no issues with parking and is quite family friendly.

ATTN: Out of towners!
Buffets? Forget about it! 

Get out and explore, you will thank yourself later, not to mention it is also easier on the wallet.

Nick: Thank you my friend, you earned a customer for life. (when I'm in town, that is!)

Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Good food, staff was attentive. Owner came to every table and said hello to everyone. Portions were a good size food was fresh and staff was super courteous. Don't let the fact that it is in a strip mall fool you it's actually well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place.  I had the Greek wrap me my wife had eggs Florentine.  We swapped plates half way.  Both of them were very good.  The poached eggs were perfect.  Service very friendly and quick.  We did have to wait 10 minutes to get seated as it was crowded the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"Had sunday breakfast and were early shortly after opening, there were already people seated and eating!  

One kid had the special strawberry french toast which was a huge portion of like 6 half thick texas toast, the side of scrambled eggs and 2 thin sausage patties.

Other kid had the steak and eggs with french fries.  The steak was thin and fatty and not very flavorful, and she didn't like the fries.

I enjoyed the denver omelet with hash browns and the hubby enjoyed the corned beef hash.

Everybody in the diner was super friendly from the owner who was walking around talkin to everyone to the servers constantly looking after us and picking up our used plates.  This was great service and the food portions are huge.

The kiddos also enjoyed some hot cocoa and chocolate milk."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Hidden in a western strip mall, the owner opens the door and personally greets everyone. The management attitude clearly carries into the staff. Fast, friendly, and good food.

It's a diner that serves an excellent breakfast and a good lunch. Standard American fare where you feel like an old friend and return customer on the first visit.

Looking forward to our return!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and wanted something off the strip that was great. Saw the reviews and headed over. The staff was amazing. Super friendly and helpful. The food came quickly and was delicious!!!! We got the western omelet and steak and eggs. Everything was cooked perfect. I have never had a ln egg cooked so perfectly. Prices were great. The owner even asked us how we were! Cant wait to come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Eileen she will take great care of you.  When you pull up don't be put off by the people waiting outside.....this is a good sign.  Put your name on the list and hang out.  Coffee is diner coffee....nothing special but it is coffee and required to function.  When your huge chicken fried steak arrives ask for extra gravy.....the gravy is why you order this.  It is by far the best sausage/bacon/gravy I have had.  Get sourdough bread.....bite the bread and notice it tastes a bit different.....because it's actual sourdough and not white bread masquerading as sourdough.  This is not on the strip which may be the attraction....it was for us.  Excellent job Mr. Mamas......we will be back when we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good late morning breakfast.  The service was a better experience than the food.  Everything we ordered was traditional breakfast fare, pancakes delicious, eggs, sausage - just eggs and sausage.  The salad was very fresh add grilled chiclen. it was too dry to eat.
Alex our server made it right and was very helpful.  The hosts and hostesses were  friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I came because of the high reviews but I'm writing so I can leave a higher review. This place is the best breakfast spot I've ever been to. The servers are knowledgeable and let me sample the gravy which was awesome. The owner himself came to talk and is as charismatic as he is strong.

I got the breakfast bowl special and my wife got eggs, hash browns, and toast. These are large portions but not vegas prices. It's so worth the trip to gear up in the morning."}
{"text":"Off to a good start for our Sunday. We waited about 15 minutes for our table it's kind of a small space in a strip mall. We ordered right away the food was well portioned and very good! 
We ordered the Mama chicken fried steak with biscuits, and the steak and eggs breakfast the steak was over cooked but still good. If we are on this side of town we will definitely be coming back. The staff is very attentive and turn tables around quickly."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been eating at MaMas for a couple years now ever sense he was on Decatur, the food is always fantastic and customer service is always great. This place is a must eat if you have never been and it's a local business and we are all about supporting"}
{"text":"Not the best place that i've eaten for breakfast. I ordered to go, and that may be the reason, but the food shouldnt taste the way it did. I am not too picky, but i ordered the spinach omelet egg white like i saw another yelpers picture and when i opened it from the box it had the nastiest smell. Then i ordered a side of guacamole and they gave me three small slices for 2$ are you serious? give me atleast four or five slices, but three small ones which were probably like one normal slice. Yea no. I should have went to the grocery store and bought a whole one for 79 cents. Well anyways I will stick with Egg & I :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. We decided we wanted something different from the strip buffets. Couldn't be more happy that we came here. Everything was so good! From the owner, to the Manager to our waiter. Everyone was so nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Everyone was so fast and efficient. We were definitely impressed. Keep up the great work and thank you! We will definitely be back the next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service is even better! Everything we had was good, except the sausage. It wasn't that they were bad we just prefer sausage links rather than patties. Everything else was great though and we hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Was wanting to try something like a little family owned style breakfast place, and this was perfect. Very quick service for a Saturday morning. Friendly staff, and of course the more important part - delicious food! Will definitely l be back here."}
{"text":"When in vegas we always come here for a good hearty breakfast. Good people good service.
 We've been coming since old location.

I love the Greek omelet.  They use 4 eggs and fresh veggies with a side of toast. And the hash browns are crispy delish.
Kids love the big pancakes with fresh whipped cream and real strawberries.,as opposed to jelly.
Bacon is crispy and good cut.
Definitely recommend this place.
Oh,the owner is super nice"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere! Management very good gave us a 40 minute wait got us in after 25 minutes. We were greeted very warmly upon arrrival and the waiter was great. The portions are great not too big but not too small either. The Marty wrap was very good so was the bourbon burger."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp, I found this place. It was a great place for a large group of us to go to. My homemade corned beef hash was amazing!! Will return again on our next trip to Vegas! Service was top notch!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim about three weeks ago and were absolutely delighted by the service, the food, and the attention to detail. Absolutely everyone was jovial and pleasant and it truly felt like a family place. We were greeted by nearly everyone in the family-owned restaurant and had trouble deciding what to order...everything sounded so delicious! I ordered coffee and was excited to be able to take fresh cream with it, kind of a rarity in Vegas diners! Once we had decided on what to eat, we didn't wait long before we were served our meal. It was not only excellently prepared (I may have had the best poached eggs of my experience) but there was great care put into selecting the ingredients to be served. 

On the whole, this place is wonderful and worth the drive. My date was also a big fan of the place! I'm so glad we found it; I'm determined to return as often as I can and to bring friends and family along with me!"}
{"text":"I don't get what everyone is raving about, this is a regular breakfast joint with a longer than usual wait. To be fair, I've only been here once. But I did not find anything special about this place. The food was average.
Chicken fried steak with gravy on the side was ok. The breading was hella thick and the taste was average.
Pancakes were pretty good. I think it's really hard to mess up pancakes, so they were good but nothing draw dropping.
Eggs sunny side up with sausage, meh. Again nothing outstanding. I think I only ate half of the sausage patty because it tasted like it was a frozen sausage patty that was heated up.
French Toast I expected more from. I LOVE French Toast but the one here did not stand out at all. I wish they would of put some berries on top or something to make it interesting.
Nothing really stood out enough to return but may be one day..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch the morning after my 21st birthday :) group of 8 and they were quickly accommodating. 

 Better than any diner I've ever been too. The hashbrows were bomb and the steak and eggs meal was to die for! And only $10! Everything was completely affordable and you get way more food and quality than you pay for. Seriously jealous they don't have this in California"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. My son loved their cinnamon rolls. The service is amazing, everyone so nice!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast spot. It is very busy, so make sure you have time to wait. The pancakes are homemade and the veggie wrap was tasty."}
{"text":"Mamas was easy to find off the freeway, a straight shot down the Jones exit 5 minutes from the strip. 

I visited at 11a on a Friday dying to try the much loved and yelped chicken fried steak. I was greeted, or was a by a hostess amongst many at a cashier table near the door. She took my name, noted the time and quoted me 10-15 minutes. Although there were several open tables and not more Than another couple waiting I shrugged it off to wash my hands. And the bathrooms are, ...functional.?.  I also spotted a delicious, largish CFS on the way back to wait. 

When I sat down to wait another hostess, checked my name, verified party of one, rolled her eyes ( at the other hostess who didn't seat me) and plunked me down at a nice table in back where I could see the action. 

Server came over quickly, took drink order and offered lemon in the water. I ordered chicken fried steak without further delay. She asked if I wanted to try the gravy because \"it's different.\" So I've heard and read. I just said bring it and quickly.

Pancakes walking by,  four high. 
Corned beef hash next door. 
Water refills quickly, coffee, non stop pour. 
Tickets out the window, two stories high. 
I'm a fan of Mamas, my, o my!

The CFS was a winning bet. Large nicely breaded and fried. Eggs and hash browns were good. It took almost forever for some wheat toast, but when it came out if it wasn't the softest freshest butterest toast I've ever had. In other words worth the wait. I assume everything is probably worth it here. Mr. Momma came by and razzed me about my Syracuse University shirt. Well Mr Mamma, SU kicked #2 Clemsons arse all night long. Hah! and I love your breakfast. Bye."}
{"text":"Had a lunch ordered a wedge salad it was delicious, service was great the place was clean and the price was fair. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great place warm atmosphere friendly staff great food the manager runs tight ship"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food here was the bomb. So we're not from around here, and we usually look on Yelp to help us find places to eat while we're traveling, sometimes even when we're home. There was three of us on this trip. But let me just tell you, this place is everything more than five stars! 

Our order
Chicken fried steak, over easy eggs, biscuit, gravy, home style potatoes. W/ slice of orange. & a Dr Pepper.
French toast, ham, scrambled eggs w/chesse, w/ slice of orange. & orange juice.
Like I said there was three of us, with two orders it filled us up, and left overs. 
And the gravy is so good!!!! You might need extra.

We ordered the chicken fried steak because it was recommended, and it lived up to its expectations. The French toast, had a tad bit much of cinnamon but we still ate it because it was cooked so lightly and perfectly. 

Our waitress, was so friendly and nice, asked friendly questions after taking our orders, and told us to take our time after she collected our plates. 

This looks like a place that wouldn't be as packed from the outside shopping center, but I think all the cars were for this place. 

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a home style breakfast, with the right portion sizes. 
Absolutely delicious. And away from the strip with the right prices."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its great rating!! This place was the highlight to our stay in Vegas!
Staff were super friendly and didn't mind chatting it up. The place ran very efficiently while we were there. I like the fact that they have pamphlet style menus for you to look at while you are waiting, a great way to save time! We came on a Sunday morning, only had about a 15 minute wait. Maybe the church crowds hadn't arrived yet, I'm not sure. It wasn't horribly busy while we were there. They did have a ton of staff working, easily in the high teens which seemed like a lot for what seemed like a smaller place.
The food was really good. I had the Marty wrap, lots of great flavor and a balanced amount of every ingredient. The wife had the chicken fried steak, which was spectacular! I know because I tried a bite, or five. The steak was tender, flavorful and they were able to keep it crispy even after the wonderful gravy they top it with. The gravy had to be made in house, it tasted home made and had sizable chunks of sausage in it. Coffee tasted like standard swill, but we did notice it was freshly ground.
This place is proof that the locals know where to go when it comes to good food. Yes, tourists have to venture off the strip but c'mon, be adventurous just once in your life and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. We really liked the coffee. And they offered a cup to go for free. That's why the place is very clouded."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas. It's not ritzee or fancy inside, just your average breakfast spot. The service is incredibly warm, welcoming, and attentive. Sometimes it can get a little busy but I assure you it is worth the wait the food is incredible. The food is always fresh, never heavy, never greasy. But beware if you don't like your picture taken because one of the managers comes around and tries to take your picture while you're eating, obviously you can say no, but just a heads up. I recommend the breakfast burrito it is A+++!"}
{"text":"I had a Denver omelette that was out of this world the place is very clean and the staff was very friendly and prompt and attentive I strongly recommend you wait here for breakfast anyway"}
{"text":"My all time favorite breakfast/brunch place. Their atmosphere is friendly and inviting, just like the staff. The food is simple but full of flavor! By far the best sausage gravy I found in Vegas. I am always bringing new people here to share the love!"}
{"text":"The food, the service, and the cleanliness was superb. This is a definite visit in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the corned beef and hash. Owner greeted everyone as they came in and thanked us on the way out. Staff was very friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and fantastic food. I had the California Omelette and it was great. 
Definitely drive out here from the strip if you're looking for a great breakfast at a great price."}
{"text":"Mmm mmmm Mr. Mama's! 

Came in on a Saturday around 1 and we made it just in time! The staff is awesome! They checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were doing okay. One of the servers even offered to take a picture of us and the food, and we didn't even ask for a picture. They were all super friendly and welcoming! 

Now onto the food!

Cinnamon roll - the first thing that came out and it definitely was a treat! It came out nice and hot, like it was fresh from the oven! The dough was soft, buttery, and melted in your mouth. It paired well with the coffee we ordered and set the tone for the rest of the meal. 

Cali Omelet - made with 4 eggs, topped with Pico, sour cream, and avocados. And comes with a side of potatoes, I got the home fries. Mmm the fries were delicious! They're diced up potatoes that are fried to be nice and crispy. Loved it! And the cali omelet hit the spot! Little old me could only finish a little more than half of my omelet. But it's so good, I would order it again!

Eggs Benedict - comes with 2 eggs Benedict with your choice of meat. My boyfriend picked sausage. I had a bite of it and it was pretty good! Also comes with a side of potatoes too. 

Bicuits and Gravy - a half order comes with 1 biscuit cut into half, a heaping scoop of gravy, and a side. We chose a sunny side up egg. They make their gravy with sausage and a bit of maple syrup. It was a little bland and too meaty for my taste. But the portion was huge, considering it was a half order. 

Breakfast done right at Mr. Mama's. Would definitely come back and start my morning there."}
{"text":"The food is great!!! But the service is exceptional they always make you feel like you are their most important customer."}
{"text":"2nd time here on this trip to Las Vegas ! We love this mom and pop breakfast spot! There is 6 of us ! We all loved it! Everything was great! Service is great! Foods great environment ! We will definitely be back next time in town."}
{"text":"Ok as a true son of the south I have had my share of great biscuits and gravy. In fact I believe that I can say that if there was a doctorate program for southern cooking I would easily be a professor of B&G. That being said Mr. Mamas is proof that Nevada will compete with the pretentious Dixieland enclaves and has a chance to be competitive. 

Imagine ripples of perfectly gray silky gravy with bits of smokey-bacon, sage-smoked sausage and maple syrup. Then add pepper to give it that perfect balance.  Combine that with the crunchy textured outside shell of a biscuit cut in twain with each fluffy pillow drenched in the gravy sipping up the good stuff with gusto.

Next time I need a hand soaking up some unmentionable bender I had on the strip I'm going to Mamas for some TLC."}
{"text":"Breakfast place with dependable quality. Often very busy though. I've only eaten there a couple of times, but it's always eggcellent."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas worth the drive away from the strip.  Their bacon is to die for, best I have ever had. Did I mention how amazing the staff was.  Nothing more valuable than an engaged owner who cares about their business."}
{"text":"We came here because of the Yelp reviews and they didn't disappoint. My food was delicious. I had the ribeye with 2 eggs and home style fries. Those potatoes were the best I have tasted possibly ever. What makes this place really special is their service. Our server was Jackie and she was super friendly and attentive. The owner greets you as you walk in, the restaurant was packed, yet the wait time was little. I will come back here whenever I am in Las Vegas! I pinky promise!"}
{"text":"We got to have the view of Belagio show without the chilly winter air. The lights from the street, smell of good food and busy dining scene quickly put us in a jolly mood.  Our waiter  was friendly and patient, we took our time to study the menu and wine list."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy were delicious. French toast was perfect. Breakfast burrito didn't hold up compared to the rest. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I Absolutely love this place. I come every Sunday. The food is so fresh and doesn't taste processed. The staff makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"The owner is always at the door, taking names and running a very efficient restaurant. He engages in pleasant conversation during the small wait we've had almost every time and is very gracious to guests.  The wait staff is always friendly and accommodating.  The food is fantastic, try the Marty Wrap and Cinnamon Roll.  Prices are right."}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent service, great home style cooking and reasonable prices check out Mr Mama's. My Husby and I have made Sunday brrakfast here a weekly tradition and we are always greeted by the owner with a big smile. The food is consistent and delicious. Go check it out and try the biscuits and grace and the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  The Spanish Omelet is so delicious!  We were welcomed by Shawn!  He is so nice!  He also took a an awesome picture of our table!  Our waitress Lourdes is the best!!  Delicious food and excellent service!  Will definitely come back again!!  Thanks again Shawn!"}
{"text":"Love this diner!!  Super friendly staff, and the manager (owner?) came up to every table to make sure everything was alright, and greeted almost everyone at the door.  Food was hot, fresh, and delicious!  Had the albacore tuna melt on texas toast, with huge scoops of tuna.  

Looks like everyone agrees that service here is top notch here!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, expect to wait just a few minutes, small place but worth it! Prices is good for the portions, they charge for lemon in your water .75..FYI may not want to sit under the fans your food may get cold, other than that..I'd go back...Sundays they close by 2p, another FYI."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable place for breakfast.   It's not fancy.  It's exactly what a breakfast joint should be.  Delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"We walked in at noon on a Thursday and the place was on fire and this is a slow day. Nick greets you at the door with a huge hello and prides himself on large portions of great food. I started with a cup of coffee to get a good feel. It was an awesome start! I ordered an egg white omelette with bacon avocado spinach and cheese. Guys shared chicken fried steak and eggs and mom had a cinnamon roll. The gravy made with sausage bacon and maple syrup delicious. A+ thank you Nick"}
{"text":"What can I say, Mr. Mamas made our last meal in Vegas the best one of the week! After a week of marginal dining Mr. Mamas was what we needed, we were met at the door by a gentleman with a friendly smile, we sat down and were greeted by Julie who went over the specials. We ordered and got our food promptly which was the Mamas French toast, totally yummy!! The owner Nick came over and talked with us for a bit, and brought my wife a most yummy cinnamon roll for her birthday! 
We are so glad we found Mr. Mamas, great food, and fantastic service. We will be visiting there when we make our way back!!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was excellent. The pancakes were huge and cooked perfectly. Loved the atmosphere and the service was top notch. Definitely coming back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I love biscuits and gravy and Mr. Mama's does it fantastically. My daughter had the deep fried French toast which is only served once a year (we got lucky) and OMG it is delicious.  There is a long wait, so don't go when starving because it will be a bit before you get seated. Definitely two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came into Vegas for Business and this Lil Gem of a Spot is what I craved. They moved  about a Mile away from the Old Spot. Claudia our server was incredible and remembered us from last year. The Biscuits & Gravy will change your life. Love this place"}
{"text":"I'm so happy we decided to stop by and try Mr. Mamas for breakfast.  The food was delicious and i appreciated the wonderful, warm,  and friendly service! I will definitely stop by for brunch whenever I'm in the Vegas area! 

PS: the onion rings are amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food here is as good as it gets!! Everything we ate tasted delicious. Staff was very friendly and the location is very clean. Most importantly there wasn't any smoke smell like all the casinos. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great friendly place and the food is bomb.
This place has the best food for the buck, better then anything on the strip, when I come in from Cali this is one of my first stop for breakfast, key tip is to get there early, they get busy"}
{"text":"Sooooooo delicious!!!!!!! My corn beef hash and everything else we ordered was yummy! We came for Mother's Day and they were busy! But all the employees were on point! They were so attentive and friendly! Will definitely come back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak....mmmm
Must order the biscuit and gravy...that gravy doe!!!!!! Eggs Benedict with sausage = yum!!!... but seriously, the gravy, sausage, bacon, maple syrup????.."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast! Love the food and service is top class too!!! I am a regular for life!

Oh did I say their french toast is a must try!"}
{"text":"went here with my friend for breakfast. we had two babies with.  wait was very long, so i was expecting amazing food. food came undercooked. staff was very nice though. but the food was disgusting. im not sure how you screw up omlets but they managed to do that.  i will never eat here again. i personally prefer the cracked egg in henderson for breakfast."}
{"text":"Found this place from yelp with 288 reviews with all 5 stars so of course we had to check it out. We were amazed. Amazing food, great service, and a great price. The owner even comes out and says hi to everyone. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food and service are always on point. Love my classic of eggs, bacon, and potatoes. Their biscuits and gravy are great. My husband loves their omelettes and pancakes. They've got flavored creamer (bonus!). The food is consistent and delicious. Closest I can get to a Michigan Coney Island breakfast (but elevated!) outside of the mitten, probably because the owner is from there. This is our go-to breakfast spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's classic Ruben is now my gold standard of sandwiches by which I will measure all other Rubens.  And, their fries are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"Home cooked meals at their finest.  Great service! Great prices! Portions run a bit big so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Great food!!! It did take 20 minutes to sit down but the host was very nice and updating us on our seating. It was worth the wait. I ordered the Cali omelet with the home fries which are like country potatoes with onion and bell peppers. The omelet was very tasty, the cheese was melted and the egg was not over cooked. The potatoes were made to the T. I also ordered a Pancake and it had very good flavor to it. The plates have a very good portion and we had some to take home, the waitress was nice enough to provide syrup to go and silverware. Such a great experience and service"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cali omelette made with egg whites, with hash browns and English muffins (I like that they had different options for toast/bread).  Food was fresh and delicious!  Coffee was good too - I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have lattes or cappuccino, though.  We arrived around 10 a.m. and waited a half hour.  Staff was very friendly.  I would definitely go back!

They can definitely cut down wait times by getting small tables for 2.  All their tables were for 4."}
{"text":"visiting a friend in Las Vegas and he took me here for breakfast. Nice place. Nice staff. Nice host at the door. Food was great. Served within in reasonable time. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, we both did. The only thing is that it is a popular place and the wait can be 30-40 minutes. Not so bad but for me, not having a place to seat while I wait is not good, as I have a bad knee. But over all the experience was great. Worth trying out this breakfast place!"}
{"text":"I went 2 days in a row and everything was amazing. I got to talk to Mr. Mamas and he truly cares about each and every guest that walks through his doors. He remembered my father and I from the day before. First day I had french toast and bacon and both were great. Second day I had pancakes and sausage and it was too much I couldn't finish it. Thank you Mr. Mamas"}
{"text":"Great service,  food is good.  Pancakes are fluffy and soft and tasted good. Ditch the casino buffet and come here. Forgot to mention as we walked up they opened the door for us,  with a big smile greeting us. 
We'll for sure coming back again when we're there!"}
{"text":"This may be one of Las Vegas hidden gem. 
This place was great, from the moment we walked in we were greeted and sat within minutes. ( large group during breakfast hours) 

Nice and attentive staff, and the food was very tasty, I'm not a \"bacon expert\" but this looked to me as if they slice their own bacon. The pancakes were tasty and filling, my friend had the biscuits with gravy and he said they were very good.  Others in my group had 2 different omelette sand they were both satisfied with their meals. 

It's not to close to the strip but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"After seeing really good reviews for this spot I decided to try it for breakfast before heading to the airport back to Atlanta. I am always looking for restaurants that the locals go to whenever I travel. The atmosphere gives you a nice cozy diner feel and  everyone greats you with a smile when you walk through the door. I don't like eggs but I'm trying to eat healthier these days so I decided to get out of my comfort zone & I had the Cali Omelette with egg whites, home fries & an English muffin. The omelette was really good & filling but the star of the meal for me was the home fries! They were cooked very well & seasoned to perfection. I highly recommend going here if you want to get away from the tourist traps on the strip. I will definitely return whenever I am back in town."}
{"text":"Started off with a bit of a wait, but well worth it. We ordered the Cali omelet, Mama's Chicken Fried Steak, and the Tuna Sandwich and all were delicious. 
Service was attentive and kind. If you're adventurous and looking for good food, you found your spot!"}
{"text":"great place for breakfast! My server was excellent, the manager is efficient and seating people as quickly as possible..and the food is delicious! Best bacon and yummy biscuits!"}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast!  Service was quick and the food perfect. A nice diversion from hotel food."}
{"text":"They were amazing!!!! So nice! Such great customer service! And the best pancake I've ever had! I'm more of a French toast person(their French toast is great too) but their pancakes were absolutely wonderful!
Lourdes was our waitress! She was so nice and attentive the whole time! 
Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was okay. Nothing too bad and nothing too good. The scrambled eggs were good and the bacon was crispy. Pancakes were really thick and tasteless. The French toast was thick but had a nice cinnamon flavor. The sausage patty was basic. I'm not sure if it's worth venturing off the strip for."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, Mr. Mamas is the place for breaky... service is great and all of the staff is nice.."}
{"text":"Have to give Ro (sorry if misspelled) the nice young lady who held the phone, take out orders, register, & whatever else came her way down. Like I told her most people do not tip when they order for togo but unless you've been in the restaurant business and or any job where tips matter they will never get it. Hopefully the good make up for the bad.

The food that we had was worth the wait! I loved the honesty & friendliness of all the staff there.  The coffee was not as strong as we'd like but still delicious. I had eggs benedict & bacon as the meat with the hollandaise sauce on the side. My husband had the best chicken fried steak & eggs ever and he let me try and I AGREE!"}
{"text":"All the positive reviews are 1000% true. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. The coffee is incredible!

The best part is probably the service. Everyone is kind, personable, and welcoming. They are proud of the resturaunt. They enjoy working there and it comes across. 

I came in with a large party, which can be a pain to sit but they took care of us. I ordered a veggie omelet with hash browns and a side of bacon. It was amazing! 

My recommendation is to start with a cinnamon roll and coffee as soon as you sit down, so you can nosh while you peruse the menu. Otherwise you'll be too full to eat it at the end of the meal because they give you just that much food."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Price was very reasonable.  Have to ask for your hashbrowns to be \"well done\" (crispy or extra crispy).  Pancakes were fluffy.  Decor is simple but does the job.  Coffee refills kept flowing.  Jacqui, our server, was very pleasant and welcoming.  All the staff were very friendly.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I visit Vegas every year as a tradition for 5 days. This is our 6th year and FIRST time ever going to Mr Mamas. Words can't describe the level of service and hospitality. The waitress staff was great and the owner was all over making sure the customers were not only enjoying their food but Vegas in general. We will ABSOLUTELY have this on our todo list for all future trips. You won't experience service better than this anywhere and this is the absolute truth."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Yummy food and good prices! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"I've been going here for over a year now. It's not a fancy place by any means but the food is always great & consistent. The service is always on point. Everyone seems to be in positive spirits and happy working here. The owner is Nick aka Mr. Mama. It's always a pleasure seeing him there. You might wait before getting seated because the place gets busy but if you want some good ole classic American breakfast and lunch. Mr. Mamas never fails!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there last week while in vegas. Super good spot. Waiter was excellent and owner came around to say hi. Food was good and plenty. Get da chicken fried steak egg wit house potatoes. Thank me later"}
{"text":"OMG !!!! I love this place! I came here for breakfast and was so happy I did. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who opened the door for us. The employees were genuine in their hospitality. This is a rare thing now a days. I want to thank all of the employees for giving us excellent customer service along with great food yummy . Men and my family are still talking about it!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Love it here!! The food, as well as the customer service was great!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must to go to when in Vegas! My wife and I stop in here every time we come. The owners are awesome and friendly. The servers are so nice and helpful. The new location looks great. Food is fresh and delicious. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Another crowd pleaser on Vegas family vacation! The space is smallish but staff are plenty quick at getting tables bussed and reset for the ever steady flow of customers. Was the hour wait worth it? Not sure since we have not had breakfast in Vegas with such a large party. Everyone was cranky and hot by the time we sat down but by the time we left most everyone was sated and ready to endure 5 hour trip home. 

Standouts:
Fresh squeezed OJ
Pancakes
French toast
Fluffy eggs and omelettes

Definitely would try again!"}
{"text":"Biggest standout here is the fantastic customer service.  While deciding on the menu the owner was out amongst the guests talking with many of them.  He made his way over to our table and struck up friendly conversation.  I was already decided on the chicken fried steak and eggs however he insisted I try the gravy first before ordering to ensure that I would enjoy the meal.  It was delicious!  The waitress we had was equally pleasant.  Mr Mamas will be a definite stop any time I happen to be in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Vegas! Pancakes-perfect! Omelet-perfect! We went back the next morning for seconds! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Great food (fills you up)  at  a reasonable price.  The staff is friendly. High marks!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 4.5 stars. And if I go again, maybe it will be a 5 star. I came with a large group early in the morning (it opens at 6am) to have a sort of business meets pleasure aka eat good food, talk work.

The service is really 5 star! Really the best. The owner came out and talked with us. Super nice guy, he gave us a history of the restaurant, explained he wanted us to have a great time and to let him know if we needed anything. The food was prompt, coffees constantly filled. 

The food: 
1. Short stack of the best pancakes, large light and fluffy! So good! With eggs over easy, and fruit. Mine was great 5/5
2. Eggs Benedict very heavy on the sauce, hash browns nothing to wow 4/5
3. Breakfast wraps: their torilla game is lacking. Not very good, wouldn't recommend 
4. I think the chicken fried steak (I didn't try it) but my friend said it was \"exceptional.\" 

Will I come back? Ya sure great price, great food. But only if I'm already going to spring valley area since its like a 25 min drive from my house. It would be my go-to if I was closer"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday. People were waiting outside to be seated, so my expectations were very high. I am pleased to say that they really came through. I had the biscuits and gravy, and I'm struggling to think of a time when I had better. The biscuits were flaky with a subtle sweetness. They seemed to have been sliced and grilled to add a bit of crust to stand up to the gravy. Speaking of gravy......chock full of sausage, and a unique smoky flavor that I've never had in country gravy. All in all, it was a MEMORABLE breakfast dish (albeit for lunch). Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Tolles Frühstücksrestaurant.Alles auf was man morgens Gelüste haben könnte bekommt man hier.Ich hatte Eier Benedikt mit Bacon und Home Fries- dazu noch ein frenchtoast-damit kann der Tag dann wohl nur gut starten.Die Bedienung ist Wiesel flink und die küchenbrigade weiß wohl was sie tut.Alles in allem werde ich wohl morgen früh wieder hier Frühstücken."}
{"text":"Great home style food. Had the burrito, delish. Owner is awesome, super friendly and we'll probably be back for that reason alone."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Very great service! The food was great as well. We had the steak and egg and the country fried chicken steak. It was so much food. Very worth the price. Also side note, they also do unlimited iced coffee."}
{"text":"Super Friendly Staff -for the most part ( i am so sorry i came in 20 minutes before closing but you were on my places to eat list)

Everything we ate(corned hash, pancakes, country fried chicken, home fries and eggs) was delicious (also the gravy could have been a little more savory?)

make sure you get those home fries instead of the hash-browns- you will regret as did I."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to eat breakfast and lunch. Killer biscuits and gravy, wraps, everything. The service is awesome and the owner is always there to great his guests with warm feelings of welcome and appreciation. This is a true gem."}
{"text":"Kat, the manager, was the best restaurant manager. Super friendly and up beat! She told us about the menu, her faves, etc. 
The portions of food were pretty generous and the prices are very affordable. Their food is great, though not super crazy delicious and different than others, that could make me crave ilike crazy. But, the Homemade Sausage Gravy  for the Chicken Fried Steak..... the best! I am not a chicken fried steak & white gravy kind of girl, but after trying it from my friend's plate, I have to say it  was goooddddd :-) I wish there were a restaurant in my neighborhood could make that kind of gravy!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and googled a breakfast place. We decided on this one because of the good reviews. Our breakfast was delicious! I had a patty melt because it was almost 11. My sisters had biscuits and gravy and an omelet. everything was just so good, as was our waiter, Alex! I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a delicious meal with comfy surroundings and excellent staff!"}
{"text":"I don't want to gush, but I am going to gush.
This place was way better than I imagined from the very first (walking in the door and being greeted by the owner) to the last (eating the left-over biscuit&gravy at lunch the next day).  
The food was THE BEST breakfast I can remember ever having.  
Everything tasted fresh and well-made (HELLO, you perfectly-poached egg) with quality ingredients.  
Service was SO excellent (they served my friends, but waited until I came back from the bathroom to bring my food so that it didn't sit there getting cold)!!!!
I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"Big portions, long lines. So get there early and usually the owner is there to greet you and make sure you are seated right away."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and the food was as expected:  standard diner fare.   However, the absolutely filthy floors and stain-covered/dirty doors made me question what the kitchen looks like.  It's also a little loud, but I expected that at a local diner."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews on point about this place. The service is good and the food is good. The price is also decent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place to go to when I am in Vegas. I have been here a few times & have never been disappointed. The food is delicious & the service is amazing! They really go above & beyond to make sure you are satisfied."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a friendly and professional host (I forgot his name). The food came quickly and it was fresh. The cinnamon rolls were warm and are made in house. They were made with the perfect amount of cinnamon and glaze. I also ordered Mama's French toast with eggs and bacon. Portions were just enough and the eggs were made to order. I will definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Took Uber here from the strip and it was so worth it. I'm not the biggest breakfast guy but some of the best cooked eggs I have ever had. I had the california omelette. I'm sure I will be back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, typical American breakfast fair. Decent prices for what we ordered.  I got the veggie wrap with hash browns.  Tasty but I've had better. Wait for 4 on a Sunday afternoon was not bad. Staff was very nice and friendly! Probly wouldn't go again unless it was a second or third option. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast time here, and the service is great! The Egg Benedict  is tasty and the steak is tender^_^"}
{"text":"I came in by myself to treat myself to some breakfast. The service was top notch! Every person in that place was pleasant and you can tell they all work as a team! I got the biscuits and gravy. I had hoped for more flavor and more \"gravy\" to smother my biscuits but honestly I ate the whole thing anyways! And the service was so good it's worth coming back and trying more food!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and attention. Was pleasantly surprised at the attentiveness of every single employee. One saw me searching for regular half and half from across the room and came to refill our bowl.  Jenna our server was on point and friendly. Food was delicious and coffee tasty. We will be back. Thank you Mr Mamas. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is the go to stop if you're ever in Vegas!
Parking is free and easy to find. 
Approximate wait time varies per day. We waited 30 minutes
Food was absolutely amazing!
Customer service is what has us coming back! They're amazing!!!!!!! 
I highly recommend this place to anyone in Vegas"}
{"text":"Looked up a spot for breakfast and found this gem, hidden about 10 minutes west of the strip.  Great food!  Very reasonable prices.  Staff was fast and friendly.  Definitely a regular spot to hit up when we're in town."}
{"text":"I love finding a great place to have breakfast that's off the beaten path. Mr. MAMAS is just that.
In a strip mall off the main drag in Vegas. Simple yet satisfying food that will leave your stomach and wallet full. Great value and quick service. 
Take an Uber or Lyft and it's about $8 from the Palms where we stayed. Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST every time I'm in Vegas. They make the fluffiest pancakes and omelets EVER. Try the Cali omelet with bacon instead of sausage. The BlackBerry pancakes were divine. My one regret is that my stomach had limits ."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on our way through Las Vegas at around 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We were immediately greeted as we walked in and felt right at home. Aside from our server, several other people stopped by our table to ask how the food was and chat with us. It was such a friendly atmosphere!

The food was good and service was quick. I think we waited under 10 minutes for our food to be brought out after ordering. I had the breakfast burrito (yummy, although I liked it better with ketchup than the salsa it came with) and my husband had the chicken fried steak, which our server recommended. Both dishes were delicious.

I don't know if we'll be back in the area anytime soon, but if we are we'll definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this restaurant looking to waste a little time and grab a quick bite for the kids. Knew nothing about this place. And it was fantastic! The service was excellent. We were greeted with a man opening the door for us with a warm hello and friendly smile. Received the same energy from our server. Food arrived fast and although we didn't order much, everything tastes great!
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a great place to have breakfast after we came back the next day because of a line outside. The wait staff was very hospitable and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Had a Swiss mushroom burger and it was delicious. The new location is huge and the staff is super friendly. The owner stopped by and asked us about breakfast was very kind and welcoming. Great family vibe, quick service and big selection of food. :)"}
{"text":"Very solid experience. The food was good and the staff was amazing. Great place if you are looking for a good classic breakfast"}
{"text":"What more can I say that hasn't already been said? The breakfast was fantastic all around. The service was friendly and they even brought out a sample of the gravy because they make it with a hint of maple syrup. They said 1/10 people don't like it, so they wanted to make sure I liked it before I ordered it. I really appreciated that, and ended up ordering the biscuits and gravy among many other things. I left full, happy, and wishing I had more room to finish the remaining food. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I don't know what's better, the food or the customer service! Came here for the very first time not knowing they were closing in 30min and the food and service were still phenomenal. The manager and employees kept reassuring us that they'd love to serve us. The food came quick and was VERY delicious. We ordered the Corned Beef Hash & Tuna melt. The place had this cozy, home-style kind of feel which I admire. They're also very clean."}
{"text":"A bit of a drive for us but ohh so worth it! The cinnamon roll so light and fluffy. The owner is very friendly and personable! The sausage gravy is great, love the garlic ranch. Hubby said the French toast was good."}
{"text":"This place is great. The customer service was one of the best that I have ever had. The food was great. The food was delicious.  Tasted like it came fome my grandmothers kitchen. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A solid choice for breakfast and lunch (or brunch if that's your thing). Large portions, friendly staff, and (most importantly) good food!

This place is very busy, and for good reason: the food is good, the atmosphere is homey, and the prices are very reasonable. When we recently visited the owner was at the door, talking with a patron as they exited. He then turned to us, and guided us to our table which was being cleaned. From there, our server just continued the chain, and we were attended to with tea and coffee never getting empty.

Date had the patty melt (very, very good) and I had the Cali omelette based upon Yelp recommendations. The hive mind was useful: the Cali omelette was indeed something to try and I would recommend it to others. Bonus points they have sour dough toast here, and use real butter on it!

If you're in town visiting and want a nice place to have breakfast or brunch, or maybe you live in the area, you should swing by and give this place a go. It's got ample parking (always helpful in Vegas), and you'll fill up your belly without busting your wallet."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! I ordered the Spanish omelette and my boyfriend the Steak and eggs, both dishes were very tasty. Can't wait to come back and try the famous cinnamon roll!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how delicious my Greek wrap was!! So dank. Owner was talking to tables, he seemed really nice. Server was on her game thanks Kathy s (:"}
{"text":"Good diner-breakfast food, with great genuine hospitality. We were greeted arriving and leaving, and even received some tips for off-the-beaten-path tourist attractions. There are already lots of detailed reviews of the food. I just wanted to get my 5-star review in here. See you next time, Mr. Mama."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was nice. I ordered something off the lunch menu, but my friends all had breakfast. We each enjoyed our dishes and there was plenty to share."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak was on point! Great service by Claudia great food!we will definitely be back our next trip to Vegas. Oh and can't forget about that cinnamon roll!"}
{"text":"We eat at Mr Mamas every time we are in Las Vegas because the outstanding service, great food and reasonable prices!  This was our visit to the new larger location on Jones.  The owner greeted us warmly at the door as he has always done in the past. They are still packed, even with the extra seating. I ordered the French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon, my hubby ordered the avocado burger. Our kids ordered breakfast items. We split a huge cinnamon roll to start the meal off right. As we have come to expect, Mr Mamas does not disappoint! Pardon me while I loosen my belt a notch now."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick brunch and shared the side of biscuits and gravy, the corned beef hash and the French toast. Everything was good but I think I still prefer Egg and I. I wanted to salt and pepper somme of the food. Big portions so you will definitely leave full. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"The owner of the place is an amazing guy! This entire place makes you feel like family and the food is great! Their customer service is phenomenal!! It's just an all around great place to be and have breakfast at! 
Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, Fast, and Wallet Friendly!!

The staff was very attentive, smiling, and we got taken care of immediately!! 

Came here on a Friday morning for some Steak and Eggs and my friend had the Denver Omelet with add mushrooms! They substituted my toast for a huge pancake!! I don't eat pancakes, but still! 

Wow ;)"}
{"text":"I am THRILLED to be writing this review. This place is more than a mom & pops place...it's the place you can go for ANY & every event in your life. 

For me...well I just came with my fiancé for Saturday brunch. It's definitely located in a plaza where you would easily miss it if you weren't using SIRI to find it (as I've driven past this place several times myself). When you get there, you're more than likely going to see people gathered outside & even sitting inside waiting for a seat in their restaurant. WORRY NOT. The wait may be 20-25 minutes...but you'll enjoy EVERY minute of whatever you order off that menu. 

Suffer now & enjoy your meal like a champion. Haha! 

We took a moment during the wait to sneak a peak at the menu and decide what we wanted...and this is what we came up with: 

1. Mama's Breakfast Burrito 
* skipped the meat...but added Pico De Gallo* 
THEY PUT IN AN ENTIRE AVOCADO IN THIS. I couldn't believe it -- that made this burrito 100% worth it & more. I usually don't eat burritos for breakfast, but I would damn sure well do it every day if it from this place. 

2. French Toast (2) 
So like, I don't know why I thought 1 order of French toast wouldn't be enough & decided to order 2. Well, I guess I overestimated...and then ate half of this item in a few minutes worth. #GobbleGobble The French toast has a little kick of cinnamon to it & you put syrup & run it through some of the powdered sugar on the plate -- and you've got yourselves a mighty good sweet tooth satisfied. 

3. Veggie Omelet 
Now this ones for the folks that can't go without eggs in the morning. Mr Mamas has a TON of options of what you can possibly do with eggs...so don't feel limited. Also, their house fries are bomb.com - so don't miss out on trying those. 

In terms of the service, it was EXCELLENT. We had people who called my fiancé by name to ask how the food was, asked to take pictures if we wanted to, and made sure our drinks were never left empty. They make customer service at other places look mediocre! 

To say we will be back is an understatement - we will be back...over & over & over again."}
{"text":"Great little diner type restaurant. Manager on the floor talking to guest.  Servers all great, and food is great down to the coffee.  I had the Marty wrap, husband had the breakfast burrito. If I lived here I would probably become a regular."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks back but forgot to put up my review! Just wanted to say that this place has such great service and the food was so good!!! The staff was very attentive and made sure that their customers were happy. I'm actually from California and was there for a festival, but the person helping us out had asked us where we were from, and turns out he grew up down the block from my friends and I. He definitely made us feel at home. Can't wait to come back to Vegas and make a stop here once again!"}
{"text":"The cornbeef hash was great! Servings were just right. The wait time on a Sunday seem to be pretty long, so get there early! Good service overall."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service!! From the minute we entered to the minute we left, every employee was amazing, smiley and seemed to genuinely care about us. The food was very reasonably priced and tasted delicious. We love breakfast and all three of us were very happy with our choices. We had the Red Rock Benny special, Mamas French Toast and an Omelette. Highly recommend this place and will definitely come back whenever we are on this side of town!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've had this place bookmarked for months! I was able to finally come in on a Saturday morning. We arrived at around 9 or 10. We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated. They have TVs in there so that you're able to watch while you wait. 

I ordered an omelette. I'm not sure what it was called but it had avocados on it lol. Maybe it was the California omelette? Something like that. It was delicious! Order their house potatoes because those were super good. It came with bread & I usually get wheat bread. I also ordered hot tea & I'm pretty sure it was just the Lipton kind. The only complaint that I have is that their water sucks... It's tap water & I can really taste it lol but I'm a drama queen when it comes to water so yeah. 

The service is really good tho! The servers are really nice & will check up on you frequently!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was amazing! From the moment you step into Mr. Mama's a smile and a friendly staff are there to welcome you. The owner is friendly and is always around to bring a cozy home feel to Mr. Mama's. Their new location is bigger and better than before! I ordered their veggie omelet and it was exactly what I was looking for. It was light and just enough for me to eat. There wasn't as much grease as I usually run into before even the toast was buttered to perfection. The food is fresh the service is amazing what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Noted for its breakfasts by locals and nonlocals alike, we found the restaurant to be packed on our arrival just after noon on a weekday.  We were finally seated after a 15 minute wait and both ordered the house made chili topped for 35 cents with onions and cheese.  The chili had a nice flavor and bite, but I am glad we only ordered the 8 ounce cups because it turned out to be a very filling meal."}
{"text":"First This is not a soul food restaurant... Came on Mother's Day and wasn't really that satisfied the food was just ok. Customer service was EXCELLENT tho very friendly staff very very friendly..... only thing I'd honestly say was that Mr. Mamas  food needs Aunt Jemamas seasoning. It's like Caucasian style southern cooking"}
{"text":"This was an inexpensive, polite, fast, professional, friendly restaurant with many servers (which reduced the waiting). The floor was open, there were three or four cooks (which increased the speed of the order). 
   I enjoyed the experience and I recommend the low cost (slightly out of the way) breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Sean is very accommodating. I'm gonna come here every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best pancakes!  And I think hash browns too!  Not sure because my husband inhaled the hash browns before I could sneak a bite, haha.  Tasty sausage gravy, you really can't go wrong here.  The staff is very friendly!  And talk about timing, when we arrived the place was decently filled with guests, but there was no wait.  When we left there was no room to get out the door because so many people were waiting to get a table!  They have pretty fast service here so I wouldn't worry too much about it, but yes you might have to wait."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited on a weekday morning and had a pleasant experience. Upon arrival, two individuals opened the doors for us and we were greeted so warmly!

After researching the menu and crowd favorites prior to my visit, I opted for the Homemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs. But, I was a bit disappointed. Not because there was anything wrong, but after reading rave reviews, I was expecting a lot. The corned beef hash was fine, but it was just about as good as everywhere else and I was not impressed. My sister chose the Chicken Fried Steak and this was a much better option. Delicious, though we agreed it needed more gravy and they were happy to provide an additional bowl of it.

Service was absolutely wonderful. Everyone is so friendly and it is a lovely environment. It is a nice restaurant with decent food, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lively and the service is great. They make you feel like friends they've known forever. The food was delicious and well, I love breakfast food, but that breakfast burrito was a winner for me."}
{"text":"Best ever Nutella crepes.  Nice environment. Everyone in our breakfast party enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Great Chili! The burger patties are homemade. Definitely a tasty one. Great attentive service. Our server basically gave me a cup of chili to \"sample\" it was so good I had to order it!
Definitely great greasy spoon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The service was beyond amazing! Talk about great teamwork and amazing customer service! I mean this place makes you feel good. You got people checking on you with smiles on their faces, staff thanking you when you leave for coming in and people holding the door open for you when you leave saying \"Have a beautiful day!\"  I mean wow oh wow these folks are great! I told my fiancé that we're definitely coming back here not only for the exceptional service but the wonderfully delicious food as well!

So, as some of you might know by now my go to breakfast food is eggs benedict! I think I'm addicted. How can one resist that perfectly poached egg and buttery hollandaise sauce? It's impossible! As soon as my fiancé saw it on the menu he said \"I know what you're getting!\"  I thought maybe just maybe today I would try something new like a wrap but nope... I failed. I'm sure glad I went with my go to dish because it was ahhhhhmaaaazzzzing! The egg was perfectly poached, loved how it drizzled over my Canadian bacon and English muffin as I cut into it. Yum! And the hollandaise sauce?! Man, I couldn't get enough! Yum, yum and more yum! I passed on the hash browns and got a side of grits because well, I'm a Texas girl and I love my grits. They were perfectly made and came with two butters. Yep, used them both. Nope, don't feel bad about it at all. 

Man oh man just writing this review has me reminiscing about that amazing breakfast and maybe drooling a little. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is second to none! You will be greeted by the owner when you arrive. Awesome customer service and the price is very reasonable. Even through this place is a little bit further from our house, trip here is worth it :) Got steak and egg, perfectly cooked like I wanted. My hot chocolate, OMG... love it..."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing has changed except for the new location. AWESOME food and service! Seems to be a tad bit smaller than the old location but more parking for sure. The owner is always working, cleaning tables etc. and does a great job making the customers feel at home. If you're in the Vegas area, this is a MUST stop for breakfast, brunch or lunch!!"}
{"text":"If you want a good old fashion breakfast or lunch with out all the gimmicks come here. Amazing food tasty and prepared well. Staff are all super friendly and very welcoming. Bring your appetite because the portions are no joke. I recommend the clam chowder home made and well seasoned yummmmm."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast wraps (I've tried all but one - I think) and quick, efficient service. They do takeout orders too. So friendly and a warm environment. Doubtlessly one of the valley's best breakfast restaurants!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas from California and found this place on Yelp. We tried it for breakfast on a Saturday - waited about 30 minutes but the staff was super nice and even thanked us for waiting. Our group ordered chicken fried steak, corned beef hash, eggs Benedict, and pancake stack. We all thought it was great and very reasonably priced. It's your standard breakfast food. Nothing like the best you've ever had but good to make you want to come back. Our server was attentive and gave us ice water and refilled coffee promptly. We left really stuffed and ready for a nap! Spent $60 including tip for 4 people. Very good when we were trying to avoid an overpriced breakfast buffet. We would definitely come back and try lunch items."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Customer service was on point, the owner even socializes with everyone and is really nice. There was a wait but they got us in really fast and the food came fast too! The food was BOMBBBB! So good! I got a Reuben sandwich and it was so yummy! My family for an omelette, pancakes, and corn beef hash. Everything was amazing .. Especially that cinnamon roll! I will be coming back for suree! this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's is hands down the best breakfast in Vegas! My friends & I went there twice during our 5 days stay. We tried another place that was supposed to be \"better\" called Jamm's but Mr. Mama's was way better. 
I had a pancake, bacon, & biscuits n' gravy. All of it was perfect. My friends had French toast--perfect. Everything was perfect. Friendly, timely service. Definitely will make it a tradition when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to Mr Mamas this morning. The staff was very welcoming. They try to seat us in a corner table Neighboring coffee station. I mentioned that  I would like a different table. The manager expressed his unhappiness several times, announcing to servers the we didn't want to seat there. Made us feel unwelcome. I simply wanted to enjoy my breakfast without looking at the server's lover backs, rubbing my table all the time. Not very esthetic . As a suggestion, to make this table more welcoming to customers they can consider room separator. 

Overall, the food was good."}
{"text":"Really well priced good food...you may want to call for a reservation as it was a 20 minute wait when we got there.

Coffee was good and strong and the omelettes where huge 4 eggs that included hash browns and toast."}
{"text":"This place is great. Lots of fun attitudes and great food. Some of the best sausage gravy I've had in a restaurant. Wife had the pancakes and said they were solid. The owner even stopped by our table to make sure we were being treated right"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Everyone was so nice and the food came out really fast. I would definitely be back here."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Hands down, the best chicken fried steak & eggs. Their gravy is so flavorful- totally homemade w/lots of meat & spices. Krystal was our waitress & the service  was excellent. Also, try the homemade cinnamon rolls. They are soft & warm with a lot of icing and cinnamon lightly sprinkled on top.  We are here on vacation and will definitely return to Mr. Mamas on our next Vegas trip. Highly, highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Couldn't decide between 3 and 4 stars.  There will be a wait but that is ok it is a smaller place. Food was ok, gravy was great,  hasbrowns so good. Now the biscuits were not southern like i had hoped they were buttery but just small. One party's chili omelet was not eaten after a few bites the chili was sweetish tasting. Our server tried but she kept forgetting it was all little things no water refill, had to catch her for the check, no followup i know they were busy. So i went with the 3 stars mainly because of my view of the haphazard order management. I sat there watching while orders filled the small order window and the orders just sat waitresses would go over look at all the dishes and walk away this happened again and again. I watched a stack of 3 pancakes sit for a good 15 minutes then they were pulled and it looked like they became a stack of 2. If those were my pancakes i would have sent them back but they werent mine. Maybe the kitchen and wait staff just need some bonding time. Next time i am in vegas i would give them another shot."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan myself I had wanted to try this restaurant, I was not disappointed! 
Being a chef myself everything was delicious, fresh, appetizing and presented well. Last but not least for Las Vegas the prices were very reasonable, this is my new neighborhood favorite and we will be back often!"}
{"text":"No lie, this place was a dining experience!

This place is fantastic!  I went in expecting very little and what I left with was a full belly and a happy smile.  These guys made good food and have EXCEPTIONAL service.

We will be back every time we are in Las Vegas

Atmosphere is that of a busy diner.

Food is delicious without being pretentious and expensive

Service is the best I have had in years"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for friendly service. We really didn't care for the food. We ordered corned beef hash, a pancake, and Florentine benedict. The pancake was mushy and not a good quality. The hash was mushy corned beef that lacked any character or taste. It is strange to have the potatoes separate from the corned beef. They also separated the hash browns from my eggs benedict which I did not like. The hollandaise and eggs were not hot or cooked properly and had zero taste. Sadly, for foodies like us who have eaten a lot of breakfast at different places, fancy and mom n pop, this was disappointing."}
{"text":"A homerun! Great food& awesome staff. A well run establishment where the owner/management makes every customer feel appreciated and welcome. 
Food Notes(because that is why you are here right?): *The corned beef hash is by far the best I have had. *Eggs done right. 
*Giant delicious pancakes.
*Onion rings....OMG....the onion rings!

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I think it is hard to beat Vegas for breakfast, that being said, Mr. Mamas fully represents!!! Looking at the pictures does not fully represent the flavor, believe that. I was looking at the pictures and even my own and I was like meh looks good but nothing crazy.

I get here and was genuinely greeted by a kind person and all of the staff was polite and welcoming my server Jazzman was very attentive and took great care of me. Even the manager Kat came over and welcomed me and helped me with my decision. She hooked me up and let me know to substitute regular toast for a pancakes (but I got sourdough as well). The fresh orange juice is just right not too sweet and delightful.

I was amazed at how fast my order came out. The Cali omelette is full of flavor and the sour cream with Pico was a perfect mix. Portions are solid. My omelette was four egg and the perfect amount, I was pretty hungry and it filled me up!

Great people great food give them a try you will be happy you did!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas wasn't expecting much because sometimes Yelp is wrong. This place is awesome and Jackie was great helping us!!  Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Personally, I wasn't 100% pleased with my choice. The half-order biscuits and gravy plus a side of scrambled eggs. I guess I'm used to super-flavorful sausage gravy and, while this was good, it didn't have the scrumptious sausage gravy taste and flavor I was looking forward to. Plus, the biscuits were almost more of a cornbread consistency rather than a fluffy biscuit. Again...not bad, but not as good as I hoped. The eggs were very good. 

My husband had the breakfast burrito and had the same sentiment...good, but still lacked good strong flavors. My sister went there about a month ago and got an omelet and had nothing but good to say about it. I'll get that next time. 

The coffee was very good. The service was outstanding...everyone was very attentive to us and very kind. It was very busy when we went, yet we still felt very welcome."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT!!! Food, parking, and pricing all good. The family loved this place. We'll be back Nick(the owner)!! Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food and service. They treat you like family. A must try when in Las Vegas. Our friends would love this place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our breakfast. The customer services was outstanding. We were seated right away. The food was good."}
{"text":"Go to this place!!! Their service is fantastic great people great food. 

Alex was my waiter and he gave excellent recommendations look for him!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.... I don't see what all the fuss is about. The food was just mediocre. Seriously, what's the hype? The staff was great but food was not worth the wait. They also need to work on the cleanliness of the front of house and bathrooms. I would hate to see the back of house. Would I come back? Maybe but probably not. Way to many options here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped to grab something to eat around 8am and were greeted and seated right away. I ordered the steak and eggs with hash browns, single pancake and 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and single pancake. I am glad he shared his EB as they were PERFECT! Now on to my breakfast: my steak was well done (I ordered Medium) my eggs with cheese and hash browns were good, the biscuits were flaky and buttery but the sausage gravy was anything but flavorful. I found myself reaching for the salt/pepper shaker to make up for the lack of flavor. My pancake was OK, but I have had better and it was definitely NOT anything to write home about. Our server was polite and attentive and made sure to check on us several times. Would we go back? I suppose we could give it another chance because one does tend to get tired of buffets and all the crowds. Over all the food was good but due to the great reviews on Yelp I was slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time their excellent service excellent food very clean, Well priced would come here again   Next time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for breakfast/brunch line out the door, but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First time here and I must say it was
One of the best experience while staying in LV!! Our food server was very friendly and professional!! The food tastes delicious and their home made ranch was unique!! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here twice. Breakfast is amazing..especially the pancakes. :) Customer service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas for a bowling tournament and saw all of the great reviews for Mr Mamas so decided to try it. So glad we did! The service was incredible and so was the food. This will definitely be a place we are sure to visit when we're in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing, fast, great and welcoming service!! Always updated us on how much longer we needed to wait and what they were doing to actively seat us promptly. Food is reasonably priced and you get good sized portions. My friend got the Jenna wrap which she loved! I got the short stack pancakes with Greek yogurt parfait which was delicious. My friend for the French toast which she enjoyed as well. Definitely recommend this place for breakfast! I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food good service I'd go there again we had the French toast and Denver omelette"}
{"text":"Found a Hairs in my foods told their stuffed but all pretending that's nothing happened 
I Will Never Going Back Again!!!! Bad Services 
How can you called yourself a professional!!!'nn 
Fucking Shame on you"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. This is a good example of customer service with fantastic food. I will return soon."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and good homestyle cooking. They have Texas toast as a toast option! It was like hitting the jackpot. My buddy said the country fried steak was on point and he's a food snob. Hidden amongst businesses just like the gem that it is."}
{"text":"Amazing service amazing food! Came here with my family and they treated us like family. We came here based on reviews and they did not disappoint! If your in Vegas and you want to eat off the strip, this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"Lets just start with the service!!! The service is amazing everyone is super friendly and hospitable! I would eat here a million times because of the service itself! I had the Cali omelette. It was DELICIOUS!! The eggs were super fluffy and moist compared to some places!"}
{"text":"This little place is jam packed but it is worth the wait. There is plenty of parking. The staff is super friendly and the owner Mr Mama went from table to table insuring everything was ok. There really was no need to do so because his staff was on top of everything. 
The food was plentiful and good. I had a breakfast burrito (sausage) that was delicious. The wife had a wrap (a burrito) that was also good. I ordered a side of home style potatoes that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I recommend you take the time to come here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much. Had the Marty Wrap and it was tasty. Love the salsa they use. Very large portions and moderately priced. I like the wide open space this place has and the staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is really as good as it gets. Right when you walk in the door, somebody immediately greets you and seats you if there's seating available. The food is always fantastic, 
(the eggs benedict is insane), and the staff always work in synergy with each other-- so while you have a server, the bussers, other waiters and managers come to your table to pre-bus, clean up, ask how your meal is and chat you up. 

In a nutshell, the food is great, your table is always clean, and your drinks are always full! Incredible service!

You won't leave here without a smile on your face. A true gem, we've already been here a dozen times, it's safe to say we'll be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"From when we walked in to leaving the restaurant, we were treated extremely special. The customer service was definitely on point and extremely friendly! 

Immediately after we walked in to the restaurant we were greeted by a very happy and welcoming gentlemen who walked us to our table. He was genuinely happy and made us feel extremely welcomed and special. In a restaurant that was almost completely full he did seem rushed or frazzled which was a pleasant feeling. He introduced us to our waitress and the service was amazing from start to finish.

Food was like any other breakfast place. Nothing special or spectacular about the menu. I'm not very picky about coffee but I do like having the option of having flavored creamers (like how many other breakfast places have) and this restaurant does not offer flavored creamers. I prefer eggworks or Baby Stacks, but have to commend this place for its amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Steak and Eggs for $10. Great deal! Excellent ALL around. Amazing value. Def will be back next trip to Vegas! If you love value and great food, this place is for you  :D"}
{"text":"Best breakfast during our Vegas stay! I found this place via Yelp, and I must say this is by far the best breakfast place we visited. The owner, and the manager repeatedly came over to our table to make sure that everything was to our liking. Both the attention and the food were top notch. A must for anyone who is looking for a perfectly balanced soul food breakfast experience, far away from the tourist traps that obviously, although unfortunately, dominate the Las Vegas Strip. Highly recommended as one of the highlights of our trip!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place was open until I saw the owner open the door.  The glass windows are mirrored so you can't see inside.  I was going to walk right past it.  When we were inside, the place was packed.  Who woulda thought?

Anyways, my friend and I decided to go in since it was lunchtime anyways.  We both ordered the country fried steak and eggs.  The food was good and plentiful.  I thought that our waitress was overly nice, to the point of being disingenuous.  It seems the whole restaurant staff was trained that way.  It's a nice neighborhood breakfast/lunch joint that seems to have a local following."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and wanted to eat away from the strip but not too far. Found this place and read the reviews and they were on point. We ordered pancakes, omelettes, biscuits and gravy. (4 people) everything was delicious and the service was great!! Will definitely stay on my list of places to revisit when we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service food was average at best.  Had the the Cali omelet and it barely had any sausage in it, pretty disappointing 
The hash browns are good
Again great service with average food"}
{"text":"Daughter said, \"I ate so much.  Now I'm ready for a nap.\"  Nuff said.

Yummy coffee, yummy pancakes, yummy hash brown.  Yummy all!!!"}
{"text":"Have been going to MrMama's for years and always the best. Today stopped in and what a change a few weeks have made. New Owner? New Management? Not sure, I did not see any of the staff that i am used to seeing. The Corned Beef hash was just chopped up corn beef, the Toast was Dry ( sorry not into toast like Elwood Blues ) and the bacon was WAY over done.

Sad because this used to be such a great place for Breakfast.  :(
 And BTW the manager asked be about my problem and offered to take off the coffee? really? don't insult me."}
{"text":"Just ate here this morning at the new location. One of the best breakfasts we've had here in Vegas and definitely the best value!

The sausage gravy biscuits were great and the Cali omelette was very good. Our service was very friendly, quick and welcoming. 

Don't forget to ask for a cinnamon bun! Delicious and perfect with a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Decent joint located in the heart of Vegas. Large, spacious facility comprised of attentive staff. Large portions for a fair price. 3 stars because although the service was excellent, there was no \"wow\" factor. Food was average as well
 No complaints though!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the greatest breakfast spot, but it's not bad either. Service is good and the staff is friendly. The food is okay. It's not exceptionally delicious, but it's filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"The hubby & I were looking for a reasonable breakfast off strip, Mr. Mamas was an excellent choice! The food is great, the owner & staff wonderful. The owner came to our table twice to check on us & gave some great recommendations for spots to try in Vegas off strip. I had the Greek omelet, my husband has the Cali omelet. We shared single orders of French toast & pancake. The food was tasty & we left stuffed!"}
{"text":"I'd saved this spot since we moved here.  Finally got the chance to swing by after our 7 miles hike.  From all the reviews it seems like it gets pretty busy.  We came around 2 PM on Friday.  There were about 8 tables seated, not too bad.  We didn't have to wait to be seated. 

I really like it that they care about their customers.  Mr. Mama came by our table to introduce himself and checked on us.  It's been a while since we went to any restaurants to where the owner/manager swings by to check up and thank you for coming in."}
{"text":"Yelped this place while in Vegas & definitely did not disappoint! Definitely home made taste and abundant portions. The service was great and they definitely earned  their 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had the steak and eggs with home fries.  My wife had the biscuits and gravy.  Kids had the pancakes and eggs.  No complaints from anyone! Food was a great deal especially with the yelp deal.  The owner came around and talked to everyone in the restaurant and added a real personal touch to everything.  We will definitely head back here for breakfast when we are on Vegas next time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - ample size , a little tiny compared to your average breakfast place , it's crowded during early breakfast hours

Service - there's a little wait but it's to be expected , owner is very attentive and welcomes you upon entering , server is prompt

Food - Food is what you'd expect from a breakfast joint . No complaints from me . I'm an omelet kinda guy . I'm simple enough . I had the California omelet which was pretty tasty and the portion was huge . My wife had french toast and she enjoyed it

Final Thoughts - There can be a wait usually on the weekends and rush hour around lunch but if you don't mind being patient , this hole in a wall is a bargain . 4 stars"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice on a weekend visits to Vegas. I love the strip but not the prices, found this little gem on yelp and decided to check it out. Even though it has been busy both time we went it wasn't a overly long wait time.

The food and staff def. justify a slightly longer wait time. Both vistits we had breakfast and though we went simple it didn't disapoint. Food came out quick and hot. This resturant will def be on my must stop list everytime we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"People love the word mama in Las Vegas . This is my first time here because of the Yelp reviews. 

This place is pretty busy through out the day, we waited for 15 minutes. 
Cleanness = A 
Services = A
Price = A
Value = A

I like this place because it tends to be lighter than most of the breakfast around . Less greasy , omelette is light on chess. After those heavy duty meals on the stripe, it is good to have a light breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! Very good food and fair prices. I will eat here any time I'm on this end of town."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and had a gyro sandwich with fries. My friend had the turkey wrap and fries. Food and service was great. Would have liked more alternatives for the side. Instead of french fries or onion rings it would be nice to have been able to get a small salad or bowl of fruit upon leaving the restaurant everybody said goodbye and even opened the door for us. Very nice and friendly. I definitely want to come back for breakfast because their menu is incredible"}
{"text":"Was told to try this place if I wanted good breakfast food at a good price and friendly service. They were right.

Pros: Large variety of food options, all very tasty. Big menu but plenty of simple options which many breakfast places try to avoid now a days by being too fancy. Service super friendly and the owner is always there yucking it up with customers.

Cons: Not the most happening location, but not bad.

Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Everything the reviews promised and more. I SO appreciate a large, friendly, attentive wait staff. Each and every person was amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic. It is off thee strip and full of locals. The food was hot, on time, tasty, and hit the spot. The service is spot on with a friendly atmosphere. I was lucky enough to brought here via a recommendation from the taxi driver. Off to the airport now and with a full stomach. Thanks to everyone."}
{"text":"Their service and food is so consistent. I come here for lunch regularly with different groups and have never heard one thing go wrong. The manager/ owner is so welcoming that I remember him from my first visit. Both Spanish omelette and veggie omelette are good: I personally am biased towards Spanish for the love of avocados. I did not like veggie wrap, it has an overdose of eggs. 
I always pair my food with orange juice, which they don't squeeze in-house, but get from a vendor everyday. They have huge portion size for both entree and side orders. Side Salad is okay, fruit salad is good, both big enough to be shared."}
{"text":"Wow. Service and food gets a full 5 stars from me. From the moment me walked in, the owner of the restaurant personally opened the doors for us and greeted us with such wonderful welcome; we felt right at home. It was an excellent start to our morning! I'm a light eater in the morning so I was aiming for something small. I ordered the half order of biscuit and sausage gravy. I don't know how our waitress picked up on this, but she asked me if I wanted to sample the gravy first. She told me their gravy was a bit on the heavier side and wanted to make sure I loved my food. She got me a quick sample, and I couldn't be happier. I don't know what they put in there but it's DELICIOUS. It wasn't overly  runny, nor was heavily caked on my biscuit. It was amazing!! Definitely worth coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Owner a Detroit guy, I'm a Chicago guy.   We both know what good food is. .  Excellent service and friendly.   I'm retired living in Arizona I wish there was a Greek restaurant like this in the Valley.
Good job Mr. Mamas.   My go to when in  Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! It was good sizes portion food for price. The pancakes were much bigger than I thought. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Can I just say BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!! This is our second trip back to this amazing breakfast spot. I'm lazy and don't want to leave the hotel so early in the morning but will go out of my way to come to this spot every time we are in Vegas! First off the guy at the front greeted and opened the door for us and put our name on the list giving us a fifteen minute wait... It didn't even take that long and we were already seated. Starving we asked the girl who took our drink order of we can put an order in for a cinnamon roll right away and she politely told us we she was not our waitress but would let us know. The waitress showed up informing us our roll would come out soon and was super patient while me and my husband were being indecisive. She offered us a sample of the corned beef after explaining the cooking process and a sample of the gravy to help us make a decision. She was super sweet and accommodating. We got the sample and went with the corned beef. It was delicious along with the super soft amazing cinnamon roll. The corned beef is not what I'm used to as a Filipino I love the canned one with rice, but it was sooooo good! Super quick in and out service, love the new location with better parking! The hostess walked us out and was personable and amazing. I love this place and highly recommend it to anybody visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sometimes good food is hard to enjoy without good service, but you don't have to worry about it at this place. Our server was very informative and Everyone else was so nice and friendly AND the food was good!  Oh sign me up for round number two, because I'll be back soon! It's a breakfast and lunch menu so you have plenty of selections"}
{"text":"Excellent place!! Super fast service super nice service....portions are great and very reasonable prices....its a must outside the strip"}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service. Very efficient and prompt service. Highly recommend trying. I'm the words of Arnold Schwarzeneggar...I'll be back !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! You might want to expect a little wait because this place is popular. We had the Mamas pancakes and biscuits with sausage gravy! Not a single complaint!"}
{"text":"The food is average, but the service is outstanding. The country fried steak is great, but the sausage gravy is so so. The corned beef hash was fresh made, but not the style I like. 

The portions are very big. Good value."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc were all very good. They weren't as good as a few of my favorite places in CA and Nev, but do rank fairly high."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, there's not a lot of diners who specialize in breakfast that are open past 2pm but thankfully this place was open till 3pm. The interior is rather simple, I rather liked the pictures from the 30's and 40's scattered around the room. They do keep their place clean making sure the next person sitting at the table isn't stepping on or leaning on leftover food.

The food: Ordered the Greek burrito which was surprisingly excellent for a diner, a definite must try when in the mood for a burrito. The pancakes here are rather good, very fluffy unlike those that taste like cake. We also tried the french toast which was ok, nothing really special about them, if I had to pick I would stick to the pancakes for your sweet tooth. Portion sizes are ok, nothing over the top, what you order is what you get. The staff here is super friendly and happy to help making sure everything was ok and our water cups filled. 

I would return here upon visiting Vegas again, good food and good people!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best experiences I have ever had when it comes to service. The food wasn't too shabby either - make sure to try the cinnamon rolls!!! Anyway, back to the service; they had accidentally served me sour cream in my burrito when I had asked for it on the side. The manager came out and apologized profusely and then came back with a cinnamon roll on the house. My sister and I were so surprised by the kindness and how they emphasized the importance of customer service. We will DEFINITELY be coming back again. Thank you Kat (the manager) for being so kind!"}
{"text":"Wow. The Owner of this place is AMAZING. We came in with a group of 13 without reservations and the Owner greeted with open arms, introducing himself as Mr. Mama and coordinated his staff to help our group. The food was spectacular and I would come here again and again."}
{"text":"If you're craving pancakes go to Mr. Mamas! Excellent service and good food at a great price."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! The best patty melt ever!!! Love that the owner is involved with the customers! Moving to the South West Vegas area soon and I will become a regular here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Honestly, this review is long overdue. I go to Las Vegas at least once a year, and about 6 or 7 years ago, I discovered this place when I was DESPERATE to get off the strip and have a good meal that was not sitting under heat lamps on a groping, sneeze-infested buffet table but also wasn't going to cost me $25+ per person. I tapped into the Yelp Hive-mind, which gave Mr. Mamas rave reviews, and I immediately experienced why... Incredibly fresh food, generous portions (without being ridiculous), super friendly service, and great value. I've been back probably 10 times, with friends, with family, with clients/colleagues, and solo... I have NEVER been disappointed, and can't recommend it highly enough. Bottom line: why would anyone eat breakfast on the strip when this place is just a couple miles away...!? I never will again.

(To answer the question below: my favorite is the Jenna wrap, but I like to mix it up. Never been disappointed. My boys [ages 12 & 15] recently declared the biscuits & gravy \"the best ever!\")"}
{"text":"I have not been in since they had moved to the new location so ventured out to check it out. I have to be honest, seems they have lost a bit of the personal touch in the new location. the staff doesn't seem to be as happy..  Service was a bit slow. had to ask for a few things more then once. Food was still very good and came out hot. The new location has alot more room which means more seating but lost some of its home family run feeling. The turn over was pretty quick. Nice and clean still which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Very clean and classy American style open seating diner style with no frills.
I ordered the BBQ beef in a pita with a bowl of chicken noodle- soup.
Was very clean and fresh tasting"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Great food, great service, great price... don't eat overpriced hotel food this place is way better and cheaper!"}
{"text":"As always, an amazing breakfast. Every time I'm in town, a visit here is mandatory. I've never been disappointed by the food or service. Sometimes there's quite a wait, but to me it's worth it! Big fan of that cinnamon roll and their bacon."}
{"text":"My coworker told me about this place, so I decided to give it a try. Of course, the first time I did, the line was already out the door (Hey, that's a good sign!) so I skipped out and tried a different day. I think the trick is to get there early (8am-ish on the weekend) because the place gets really busy. I got the corned beef hash with over easy eggs, home fries, and sourdough toast. The service overall was very good, and the owner walks around checking up on people. Sometimes I think this can be weird, but in this case, I loved it because he seemed very genuine. The home fries were so delicious, and the orange juice tasted fresh. Definitely one of the best breakfast spots on this side of town!"}
{"text":"This is always a must for our group when we come out to Vegas. The owners are always there, asking if you want a photo or just being cool people taking to everyone in the small but worth the wait restaurant. I appreciate and prefer small family owned and operated since that's my background. The food is always on point, we have never had to send anything back or even ask for anything because the service is just that good!!  Grab an Uber and try Mr Mamas today!!!!"}
{"text":"pancakes are fluffy and delicious...
ham patty taste good...
services excellent.. 
portion huge
price on par....
highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and a few miles from the strip, Mr. Mama's is inconspicuously nestled in the middle of a small strip mall and hidden from the roving eye of those who choose to inhabit the multimillion dollar name brand food giants dotting Las Vegas Boulevard.

Although the wait time (@ 11:30 on a Sunday morning) was 45 minutes, the casual, easygoing atmosphere, superb service and delectable menu items laid to rest the original apprehension to bolt for a less crowded establishment - this place definitely optimizes the term \"all good things to those who wait.\"

Our eight strong and very hungry party was completely satisfied with the service, food choices and tastiness of the food! Yes, Mr. Mama's serves mainly breakfast and brunch items, but everyone was thoroughly satiated with the gratifying bill of fare. 

Wade your way through the local populace, place your name on the wait list and be prepared to indulge in a tiny slice of breakfast and brunch heaven. If you are not already on this list, you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is so good from the second you walk in the door you are greeted . Diner is cute and staff has it dialed in . We ordered French toast breakfast and biscuits and gravy . French toast was perfectly cooked and flavor was on point.  Biscuits were flaky and moist gravy had tons of sausage  and lightly seasoned yummy . Hash browns were the best I've ever had . You can't go wrong with this place . If your looking for great food alittle off the strip this is the place to come for good food at a great price . It was so good we ate there two days in a row on our visit to Vegas for super bowl weekend. Next time we visit this is our spot . Definitely getting their homemade cinnamon roll looked amazing"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good breakfast, this is the place. It is nice that it is off the strip. Come hungry, lots of food! The staff is really friendly and very accommodating. Our waitress was honest and very helpful. We will be coming back here every time we visit Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the old location before and this was my first time trying out the new place. The service here is great. It's very mom and pop. The food is very hearty. After eating at healthier alternative restaurants, I couldn't eat much of my meal. No complaints about the food but it's just very heavy."}
{"text":"This is THE PLACE NOT TO MISS when you're in Vegas. Great food, great service, and a great time. If you're unsure about something they'll give you a sample so you can decide. I had their corn beef hash, and it was the best I've ever had. Seasoned right, and perfectly crispy. The hash browns were crispy and you can top them with whatever you'd like. I topped mine with cheese and onions, sooo good. Our servers were super nice. This is the kind of mom and pop places that you want to keep coming back to over and over again. And we shall! Every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic 
Everything about the place is awesome. Service, food all is top notch!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I had the mushroom Swiss burger and a side salad and it was amazing!!  We're definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, and great service! Found out about this place while I was eating at another breakfast place. The guy that recommended this place said Mr. Mamas is his go to place! I can see why!"}
{"text":"THE BEST MEAL EVER!!! Everything was excellent. The service, the introductions, the meals were exquisite. My other half is a chef and he admitted he couldn't do much better, which means a lot! This place could charge triple (could being the key word!) and I'd still leave a 40% tip! Great personalities in every department... THANK YOU MR. MAMMA'S!!"}
{"text":"The best food we ever had in Vegas. We took an extra detour just to get here for breakfast and we weren't disappointed. The french toast was light and tasty and the omelette was absolutely delicious. The owner also has a lot of stories to tell!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast and brunch selections.  I vastly prefer this to the Peppermill, though the decor is nil and the floor is dirty.  My husband said the hollandaise on his Eggs Benedict was the best he'd ever had (it's made with the choice of not only bacon, sausage and Canadian bacon, but also chicken and steak!).  The OJ is scrumptious.

Vegan Report:

The veggie wrap with avocado substituted for eggs is fantastic!   Love that it comes with salsa."}
{"text":"The food is good, but what makes this place stand out are the servers. The servers could lead training's on compassion and customer retention."}
{"text":"OK where do I start
Today was my first time at Mr. mama's
I walked in around 12:30 
I wasn't impressed
The person who took my drink order was Sean
He was very unprofessional and rude
Sorry but i wont be back
Food was good !"}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing. Checking to make sure everything at the table is going well, ensuring our experience there is great. Food was well seasoned, coffee kept flowing, and staff was extremely accommodating. Service was super quick, a party of 33 came in after us, and ordered 19 plates to go; the staff accommodated everyone well, got all the food out. (I liked that they didn't make a huge banquet table for the big party, everyone sat down at different tables.. kept the staff ensuring everyone ate, no one waited too long, and the whole party was out by the time we were done with our meals as well). Will def come back again! Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mr. Mama's twice now and I forgot to review this awesome place!! Both times I had the biscuits & gravy because it's SO DELISH! My Hubby & I went the 2nd time (1st time for him) and he was impressed! He's a Chef so he has a critic that's not the norm but he truly enjoyed it! Our service was a DREAM! The staff are incredibly heartfelt and you fell like you are at a family members' home eating. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Go for the food, not for the experience. Slow and inattentive staff.

tl;dr

Our party of 2 arrived at 11:40am and were seated fairly quickly.  We didn't have to wait in line, but it seemed like they were about to hit max capacity.  The seats were still wet from them wiping it down and neglecting to dry the seat with a fresh towel afterwards.  

It took a good 5 minutes for our server to come to us to take our drink and food order. Our server seemed really distracted by her cell phone. At first I just assumed that they took orders on a device, but half way through our order she took out a notepad? Anywho, I ordered a eggs benedict and my friend ordered a swiss mushroom burger. 

And then we waited...and waited.....and waited... I finally flagged down our server at 12:20pm and asked where our food was.  She said that the eggs took a long time (really?) and that it's coming soon.  We finally got our breakfast food at 12:25pm - 40 mins after we arrived at the restaurant. Our server didn't even seem to realize that it took so long, and obviously no apology was even offered.

The only reason that I'm giving a 2 stars is because the food was delicious! But I would probably not return due to the excessive long wait and inattentive staff.

Our check arrived promptly when we were finished and they collected it fairly promptly as well. And then we waited.....and waited.....and waited. It took another 5 mins before they got my change back to me."}
{"text":"Good place on the westside for Breakfast and Lunch.  Nothing Fancy just good service, very good food and affordable.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast we've had in Vegas! The staff was super polite, it's away from the strip, and no crowds when we got there around 8:30AM. 
Their gravy was delicious, and portions are huge. 
We didn't eat until around 5:00pm after eating there. 
It's you're typical breakfast place they have biscuits and gravy, omelettes, steak and eggs, pancakes etc. 
Prices are extremely reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Discovered this place off the strip.  Really great for breakfast.  Food has always been good, reasonably priced and we've always had good service.  Whenever we come to Vegas we always make to stop in.  Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of the great and friendly service and the delicious food! Whenever I have a breakfast craving, I think of Mr. Mamas first. Best Chicken Fried Steak ive ever had!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast/lunch restaurant in las vegas went 3 days in a row can't get enough the staff is by far the most helpful attentive I ever encountered food is amazing restaurant is immaculate the owner is very in tune with his guest needs very nice man will even open the front door for you i will be going here at least once a week from now on my wife and I love everything about mr mamma"}
{"text":"Came to this place based on yelp reviews.... Yelp never lets you down!  First, the service was amazing..... We got there and even though it was very busy we were greeted at the door by the owner Nick and seated within 10 minutes.  The breakfast was prepared perfectly!   Scrambled eggs, home fries and bacon!  I had to try the pancakes that everyone raves about and they did  not disappoint... Fluffy and very big!  I am going to come back for lunch!  The owner is very proud of his business and should be.  He treats everyone kindly and makes sure that they have a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Was just OK. Expected more from all the great reviews, but just average food...albeit large servings. Wish I could rave about how great it was, but it really wasn't. We had two different egg dishes that were very bland. Very busy and really not worth the wait. Sorry, but we won't be returning. All the best."}
{"text":"What a gem! The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The food(chicken fried steak and eggs) was delicious. Well worth the drive from the strip!"}
{"text":"From the very beginning of walking into this place, I was surprised by their service. They opened the doors for us... Not just one door, but both! Lol I felt ROYAL LOL! 
  I've been wanting to try this place for a while since the reviews were high and everyone seems to have only good things to say. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was SO good! It wasn't mediocre either. Something about their gravy made the flavor with the fried chicken perfect to the pallet. My food was so good when my husband wanted to try it, he wanted more! (DANG! Eat your own food!) 
  Service was quick and we didn't have to wait to be seated. May I add that all the condiments are already on the table so you don't have to ask the server for anything maybe except for a refill on your drink. Anyway, I can understand why this place is loved by so many. The staff is so awesome and friendly, I feel like I'm eating a meal at home. I will always come back to this place. THANKS MR. MAMAS!"}
{"text":"No frills

Good fluffy pancakes and ribeye breakfast steaks

Awesome server

Nice to finally pay normal food prices than from the hotels!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it had a long wait on the weekend but that's usually a good sign they serve good food. That turned out to be right, great food, huge portions and for a cheap price. If you like traditional american breakfasts, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"In town for a wedding over the weekend and went here saturday morning with family. Best meal i had all weekend"}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place based on yelp reviews and did not disappoint. This is located in a strip mall and we came here before returning our rental car. The service here is fast and friendly and the food is great!. The serving is ample; even my husband couldn't finish his order!  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and the amount of food you get. I had the california omelette with whole grain toast and the hubby had a short stack with ham and eggs- the pancakes were huge!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always our stop when we get  to Vegas! Great service great food...Thank you Mr mama. . Love from the San diegans."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while visiting my dad and figured I'd give it a try. I ordered their veggie omelette, turned it into a  egg white scramble with added avocado and also added a ice mocha coffee. Everything was amazing. Most dish come with potatoes but I substituted my potatoes for fruit. The good was amazing and so was the service. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about it, tasteless omelette, unflavored hash browns, even worst pancakes.
Despite beautiful pictures in reviews and 45 minutes waiting time......see ya never.
Only good thing, waitress was nice ."}
{"text":"Awesome service at this family place. There are regulars whom go here often, but new customers like ourselves are always welcomed.  We felt welcomed!!!  Unexpected, yet awesome!!!

Food was delicious. Owner is super friendly. Spoke to us about how Mr Momas got their name too, real cool story.  Just ask him when you are here.  He's very approachable.  

Got the steak and eggs and home fries which looks like potato tators from Broasted Chicken out by Los Alamitos, CA.(which I would recommend anybody try at least once in their lifetime).

My lady got the \"Shortstack\" of pancakes, sausage, and eggs.  I also got her some home fries on the side too.

We also order the fruit bowl and the server made sure my lady got her strawberries.

Got some OJ here, normal stuff. 

Again, service was fast and top notch here.  I'm blown away. 

The yelp deal is worth the money.    Try this place if you are in Vegas, worth the money even without the yelp deal if you are sick of the buffet food at the Casinos. 

Plenty of parking in the plaza, but just make sure you don't park next to those \"lifted trucks\"....they don't know how to drive and will probably damaged your vehicle when they are leaving by turning to close to your vehicle and clipping it. Just saying.

Will be back next time we are in Vegas again this year.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Solid solid vegas breakfast spot.Good value and tasty no frills american  breakfast.

 I went with the 
Cali Omelet- Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage Pico De Gallo , Sour Cream, topped with Avocado. 

The omlette was very solid and the toast was solid as well. The service here is also very good and the owner makes it a point to make it to every table which is a nice touch.  I elected to go with the fruit bowl instead of the omelette and my 3 star rating (and not 4) is because at 4 star breakfast spots the fruit sides I've found to be diverse and generous. At Mr. Mamas the fruit cup was on the smaller side and didn't have a wide variety of fruits. 

Service was definitely above average, main food was solid, and the fruit options was a little bit below average so I went with a 3 star rating since I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to return to this spot."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and owner.  Wife had the ABC omelet side of hashbrowns and I had the Marty wrap with home fries.  Both very good items.  Get the home fries.  They're like thick potatoe chips. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place, amazing steak and eggs, great staff! My cup never got empty and the manager came around to make sure we were having a good time. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Western omelette with fries. I thought it was good but not amazing. The price is perfect though. I went by myself on a Saturday after noon and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. They do not have a counter area, they only have tables. The service is super friendly and fast. A very efficient business which is great given how many people were eating there on Saturday. 

I liked the fries but will come back for the hashbrowns and the home fries. The burgers look soo appealing as well. 

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Mr.Mamas is a great small little breakfast restaurant that is just good. It's not necessarily spectacular but it's great for the price and for the feel. When it's not busy the service is a little better but for the most part everyone seems to be a little scattered. You'll walk in, multiple people will be waiting (there's also not really a waiting area at all), and it looks like like the hostess/cashier/takeout taker is always frantically looking for help or for other people to listen to her. It just seems a little unorganized which causes you to be sat and then no one comes to help you because they're so busy the server doesn't realize their sat OR once I was sat and because there was no communication 4-5 servers asked me my drink order. Overall the food is good and affordable and if you want a no fuss breakfast where you sit and leave this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Ribeye and eggs...and pancakes.   Service is so friendly and quick.   Food is delicious. Pancakes are soooo good and I normally eat one bite and I'm done.    Eating the entire pancake."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place ! Every time we have breakfast here we leave HAPPY & FULL ! 

The food and service is awesome ! We love the new location . We we're glad they didn't move too far from us ."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.  Be prepared to wait....our group of 9 waited 45 mins after arriving at noon.  Place seemed less crowded when we were finished eating but I believe it closes at 3."}
{"text":"Great local spot for breakfast. Great service and the food is excellent. My boyfriend and I always try something diff on the menu every time we come here and it never disappoints us. Everyone was very attentive and extremely friendly to ask if we needed anything else. This is definitely one of our fav spots."}
{"text":"Just visited yesterday. It was a group of 6. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait but we only waited about 20 minutes. I ordered a Cali omelet. And it was sooo delicious. The price was very inexpensive. Service was also great. I will be back next time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on here, I can't add anything different.  We happened to just walk in here on a whim, and like everyone says, we were greeted at the door with a smile and a genuine greeting.  Our server was incredibly helpful, even advising that we might be ordering too much food, as their servings were big.  The food was prepared quickly and was delicious!  The wrap I got (Marty Wrap?) was HUGE and absolutely delicious.  Everything else we got was amazing.  During our meal, the same guy that greeted us at the door stopped by to see if everything was ok.  The prices are very reasonable.  We felt like we had made a GREAT choice.  At our departure, the same guy - must be the owner - opened the door for us and thanked us, and invited us back again.  One other thing, you can really see the 100% real customer service that all the employees feel.  When walking guests to their tables, the servers didn't just seat them and give them menus, there was conversation, eye contact, real caring.  That's rare these days.  10 thumbs up and 50 stars to this place.  I'll be back and will be happy to tell everyone I know about Mr Mamas."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fresh. Quick service and Mr Mama is awesome!  Definitely must visit"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and really enjoy the food.  Neither of us have had anything that we didn't like...usually come for breakfast and the food is always hot, fresh and well prepared.  Nick, the owner is delightful and the rest of the staff are always friendly.  This remains on our list of \"Go-To\" breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after reading the great reviews. The food was good, but nothing special. They up-charge for every single thing...pretty annoying. 

The service was good and the staff is very friendly...yet they can be a bit aggravating. 

Ordered 3 eggs, 3 pancakes and bacon. Meal wasn't bad at all. But, I wasn't WOWED:-( eggs were a bit runny too. The pancakes had good flavor, but nothing distinctive. 

I probably won't try this place again. Nothing compelled me to return."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 38/100***

Browsing thru my bookmarked places, Mr. Mamas got the majority's vote to try for my daughters birthday breakfast. We arrived around 9 am on a Monday, I was dreading the anticipated long line as I've heard and read rave reviews about this place. Luckily, there was only a few people ahead of us and we only had to wait a couple of minutes.

As far as the menu, it was pretty straight forward and not extensive. I didn't see any waffles, crepes or eggs benedict. 

I give the food 3 stars and an extra one for good service. Our waitress Crystal was helpful and she constantly checked on us, though she seemed distracted at times. We mentioned it was our first time and asked for popular dishes ordered. She suggested the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs with sausage gravy which she asked if I wanted to try first in case it wasn't to my liking, I thought that was very nice of her so I wouldn't be stuck with something I didn't like. She also brought us a complementary Cinnamon roll for the birthday girl to try. They didn't have any specialty pancakes but she said they can put chocolate chips if we wanted. She asked if I wanted onions and peppers with my home fries and I said sure, but what she failed to mention was that all those add ins (chocolate chips, onions and peppers) were add on charges as well. It wasn't a big deal for us when I saw the bill but I could see potential issues arise. Also ordered by our party was the Corned beef hash, Western Omelet, and Buttermilk pancakes with bacon and eggs. I can't say the food was extraordinary after all it's breakfast fare and it's kind of hard to screw that up. Though I will say the pancakes were fluffy and the bacon thick, extra crispy and delicious.

Their hospitality more than anything is what makes them popular with tourists and locals alike. Looking forward to a follow up visit to try their other offerings.

{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas!! If you haven't tried their breakfast burrito, you're doing it wrong!"}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's is everything the reviews are saying. I tried it this morning based on Yelp reviews and oh boy! We're talking some good stuff your face slap yo mama down home cookin! The portions are huge you will leave happily stuffed and waddling your satisfied booty out the door. I ordered the chicken fried steak smothered with the gravy lord have mercy! I will be back next time I visit Vegas! Perfect score for food EXCELLENT customer service AND we got to meet Me. Mama's!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for leading me here! Me and my friends were trying to figure out where to eat breakfast and we came across Mr. Mamas. The reviews and pictures said it all and our decision was easily made to check it out. 

When we arrived there were groups of people waiting to be seated. Our wait time was 20 minutes but it ended up being 10. Staff is great at keeping you informed when they're preparing your table. 

The hardest part was trying to figure out what to order especially when you're Hangry everything sounds good! 

I ordered the veggie omelette + cheddar/jack cheese (extra). This comes with hash browns, toast, and fruit all for only $9.95. I also ordered a side of bacon Everything was great! Portion size was huge I couldn't finish my plate. 

We shared the half size biscuits n sausage gravy to try out ($5.95) The gravy was creamy and delicious and the biscuits warm and fluffy. 

Mr. Mama himself is the man coming around greeting each table and kindly checking on customers making sure all is good. That goes to show how much they care about customer satisfaction. 

Overall the entire staff is great and always checking on you. I really enjoyed the food here and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Starting the day off right.

No six pound breakfast burritos, 24 inch pancakes, or ghost pepper infused syrup challenges. Just really great breakfast food served by the friendliest staff.

We're talking crispy hash browns, perfectly poached eggs atop toasted English muffins with a dollop of rich, not to tart hollandaise sauce, fluffy made from scratch pancakes, flaky on the outside moist on the inside biscuits, and hand pulled, spice flavor packed corned beef hash.  An everyday cup of Joe to wash it down. Nothing fancy but everything correct.

Service is exceptionally friendly. Not over-the-top but comfortable and welcoming.

Off Strip pricing.

Straightforward, solid, zero complaints. An excellent choice for breakfast off the Strip."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite breakfast places in Vegas. The customer service is always on point. Staff is always super friendly and the food is consistently delicious. Shawn is always super friendly and makes your experience there very enjoyable. Love that the owner is there most of the time and makes sure to welcome you and thank you for coming in. Kat is one of the fabulous and upbeat personalities that you will get to hopefully interact with - Great spot - Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Although VERY good, the delicious breakfast takes a close second to the level of service by the wait staff. It really comes down to communication and helping to ensure you get exactly what you want; how you want it. 

But it's more than that. If you listen, you will become keenly aware of the communication and quality assurance that is happening between the front and the back. Other restaurant owners should come learn from this simple and yet effective approach. 

So come eat! I had the chicken fried steak and switched out the potatoes & toast for a biscuit and gravy."}
{"text":"My husband and I were recommended by his coworker to come here at our next Vegas getaway. It just so happened that this is located next to the dog groomers I dropped by boys off at. 

We went on a weekend and it was quite busy. The restaurant felt homey and all the workers were very friendly and efficient. We were seated promptly and was given some time to review the menu. 

There were so many options and everything sounded so delicious. It didn't help that all the customers around us also had yummy smelling food. I would recommend to review the menu before you visit so you have a better grasp on what you want when you're there. 

We finally decided on our order and my goodness, it was so delicious. Good pricing, great portions and well cooked. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast here and will definitely be stopping by on our next trip."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is a can't miss breakfast spot!!!

I've forgotten just how delicious a deep-fried steak smothered in gravy can taste like when its on point. The thinly pounded steak was breaded perfectly and had the right amount of crisp. The thick gravy just put everything together, made my stomach happy.
I opted not to get the toast, instead I received one big pancake. 
I felt the price was reasonable considering the quality was outstanding and the portions was big.
  

The service is excellent, the staff are nice people and they took care of me.


I'll definitely be visiting Mr. Mamas again!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Alittle off the strip, however worth the trip.  Owner is super friendly and helpful.  I got the chicken fried steak, friend ordered the Eggs Benedict.  All was great!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch place off the beaten path. Frequented by locals, the portions are ample and the quality excellent."}
{"text":"The reviews are right. It was one of the best breakfast I've had in Las Vegas. The eggs Benedict were great. The service was very a ate give and personalized. All meals were great and relatively cost efficient. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"When you are in LV, you really need to stop into this place. Other than the food was amazing, the staff was just as great! Friendly faces and a strong attention to detail is what you will receive here. An affordable price for such top quality food. Thank you to Mr.
Mama's for making our experience exceptional. We will be back tomorrow for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Having eaten enough for a bear's hibernation at Via Brasil the night before, we decided to hit an early breakfast with some out of town friends before their flight home. 

I'm not generally a breakfast person and wasn't too hungry so two of us split a full stack of pancakes and neither of us walked out hungry. The other party both got steak and eggs and neither of them complained. 

There's nothing too fancy or incredible on the menu, just your basics done well. The host was friendly. The prices were decent. The food came out hot, it was pretty good and the service was on point as well. I had to ask for butter three times and each time I got my butter pretty fast. If you're doing regular pancakes I like to place a ball of butter between each pancake and let it melt with the heat, then hit the syrup...yelp tip courtesy of my arteries.

The place was packed for us on a Saturday morning so if you are coming on a weekend, expect a short wait."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the service here was fantastic. Every staff member goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and that they appreciate your business. We came here the day after a long night out with hangovers. The breakfast (eaten more at lunchtime) was just what we needed. We got french toast, a build-your-own omelette, and started with a bowl of beef vegetable soup (weird I know but I wanted something substantial in my tummy fast) plus coffee and soda. The omelette was great -  we ordered it with ham and mushrooms plus fresh slices of avocado on top - it wasn't greasy like you often get at diners, so I was happy. The french toast was just ok - bread tasted not so fresh. Home fries that came with the omelette were ok, but not as crisp or as seasoned as we like. Beef vegetable soup had great flavor and tasted like something my mom would make (that's a good thing). In short, I'd give the service a five star and the food a three star - so I rounded it to an overall 4 star."}
{"text":"The owner is usually welcoming you as you walk in and thanking you as you leave. The food is always good and Denise is our favorite server!"}
{"text":"We have breakfast here whenever we are in Las Vegas. Bring your big appetite because the portions are huge. Everything is good. I always have the pancakes and ham the pancake covers the entire plate. My husband had the veggie omelet and  loved it. The owner and his son are really friendly along with the wait staff. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent local spot for breakfast.  The food was outstanding and the service was great.  The place is clean and well-managed.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What everyone said - get the fresh hot and frosting covered cinnamon roll! Mmm

I got the chicken fried steak and eggs , and of course we couldn't forget the extra side of bacon. 
Each item was cooked to perfection, from the batter, the seasoning, and frying. 

What really shines about this place is the service ! The host and the servers look a little rough on he outside with their tattoos and buffness, but they were seriously some of the nicest and most genuine people I have ever had the pleasure of being served by!"}
{"text":"I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews but this place has got the formula right:  Good food at a great price with incredible service. 

There is a reason that this place is packed when you go.   If you are seeking a traditional American breakfast in Las Vegas then your search is over.  This is the place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The pictures of the food online do not do this place justice. Fresh tasting food!  Had the chicken fried steak. Felt so good after the meal. Claudia our server was so wonderful!   All of the staff come by and make sure you have what you want or need. This is a must on our list!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome... But the food- to die for! Probably the best omelet I've ever had... And everything comes in such large portions. You wouldn't leave still hungry and unhappy! Highly suggest"}
{"text":"There is a long wait, but that's justified considering the impeccable service & quality comfort food for breakfast.  We had a huge party of 9 but were seated in about 30 min.  Staff was incredibly efficient & attentive to our needs especially with 3 kids in the group.  Food was satisfying for breakfast - corned beef, poached eggs, toast, pancakes, bacon, hash browns.  The owner even provided a french toast sample while we waited.  My Ma would have loved to order it if only it was officially on the menu."}
{"text":"This was a nice little spot to eat breakfast. The atmosphere was great and all the employees were very friendly. First time here, but I enjoyed their food and ambience."}
{"text":"Nothing fabulous and nothing horrible. Just your run of the mill breakfast spot. Country fried steak was average. Service was average. Menu offerings are average and what you would expect. Just an average restaurant with as far as I can tell nothing but a long wait to set it apart from any other breakfast restaurant. I wouldn't drive across town to experience Mr. Mama's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Nick, the owner, is like family. One of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Claudia always treats us phenomenally... Food is great. HIGHLY recommend it!"}
{"text":"Service here was fantastic. The manager and our server were very friendly. However, the food is very average, don't get too excited by all of the positive reviews."}
{"text":"They keep people coming back. Food is good. Atmosphere is nice. Staff is friendly. I see why this place does well. They consistently serve a good product. Well done little Ma and Pa place."}
{"text":"Very nice, service was great. Food was not bad and portions were huge so don't order individual plates for the kids or you will have leftovers."}
{"text":"An excellent breakfast!  We were in town for a conference staying at Caesar's.   Food on the strip is expensive and mediocre.   So we hit up Yelp and found where the locals go for breakfast.   Mr. Mama's was a short drive off the strip and well worth it.  The hosts were terrific, the service top notch, and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. The owner personally greets you upon entering. He let us know there was a 15 minute wait and made sure we were okay with that before adding us on the list. Once people cleared up a table they were quick to turn it around. We ended up seated in half the time ge quoted which was awesome.
The portions were big and flavorful. Definitely get the corned beef hashso yummy.  Staff is attentive and take pride in a great place to work. They will even snap a pic if you like.  Just 10 minutes off the strip but worth it. Coming back next time we are in the 702."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and super friendly staff! Prices were very reasonable. The chicken fried steak was absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"Wow! The service here is better than any breakfast place I have ever been too. The biscuits and gravy were amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Good food fast pace turning table and food fast. Nice people! Good prices nice to find mom and pop places to eat"}
{"text":"I am visiting my mom in Vegas and she tells me she really was craving pancakes so I went on YELP to see where the best pancakes were near her house. I told her that a restaurant with over 1000 great reviews had to be a good place. We looked at the menu and watched the packed restaurant serve some of the dishes which the portions looked HUGE so we decided to split something but had to at least try the cinnamon roll. It was by far the best homemade cinnamon role we've ever tried. The pancakes were delicious, the service was super. The owner Nick came over to greet us and we told him that we were trying his restaurant based on YELP reviews. He told us a bit about his family & beginnings. Very nice & interesting story. We had a bit of the cinnamon roll and pancake we brought home and my brother came over to the house about 6:00pm and we told him of the restaurant and the great food and he went to the refrigerator and heated up the leftovers. He said he couldn't wait to go there with his family.
Give yourself a real treat and try this place."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love to come here! The food is great and the staff is very personable!  Can't say enough good things about this great family restaurant. Sometimes we wish they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Mr mama's and their staff gave exceptionally great customer service. They were on top of it! It's too bad I didn't get our waitress' name because she was superb as well. All I know is that she was from Mexico, has fair skin and was gentle with us throughout our whole breakfast experience there. Just wanted to give her a shoutout. And thank you to Mr mama! Mahalo from the couple from Hawaii."}
{"text":"We drive across town just to eat at Mr. Mamas! The food here is excellent, the staff and owner are friendly and attentive. This is just the perfect spot for breakfast! Whether you are a local or just visiting from out of town you owe it to yourself to come in and try Mr. Mamas. I will post pictures next time but the food looked too good to even pause and snap a quick pic. Everything is prepared fresh, I love the gravy, they give you a disclaimer since it's made sweet but it is delicious. I paired it with the biscuits and they were excellent. Soft, fresh, not dry melt in your mouth bread! We will definitely back and have been spreading the word for this place. Also love the new bigger location, a little further for us but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem thanks to Yelp! and all the high praise was well deserved.  We were there for breakfast mid-morning on a Sunday.  Yes, we had a long wait but it was well worth it.  The coffee was fantastic!  They grind their own beans just before brewing.  Their gravy has sausage and bacon and a little maple syrup mixed in.  Heaven!  Plus, the staff is friendly, helpful, courteous, and make you feel welcome and as though you are in their home kitchen."}
{"text":"Great service, incredible food, Friendly atmosphere. Also has a person who takes the best selfies. Great way to end our Vegas trip. Must visit! And I defiantly will return."}
{"text":"1st time and it was delicious...Here in Vegas for the weekend and wanted to try a breakfast spot off the strip. I had the Mamas Short Stack and literally it could feed 2 people...Would definitely recommend xoxo"}
{"text":"Why do I give this place 5 stars you ask????  Well they are serving up high quality, reasonably priced food that tastes great.

Stopped by here for an early lunch with the hubs and was greeted at the door by 2 staff members.  Very friendly and welcoming.  We were given a choice of where we would like to sit and asked what we wanted to drink.  Moments later our waitress returned with our drinks and took our order with her phone.  Really cook concept!  I had an omelet that I asked to be converted into a scramble.  It was served with a choice of potato and toast.  The meal was huge and tasted great.  My scramble came with a half of an avocado!  Right on Mr. Mama!

This restaurant is in a strip mall not far from the 215.  Parking was a breeze and the food came out in good time.  One thing is for sure...we will be back!"}
{"text":"In A Location Where You Would Not Expect Such A Great Restaurant. Service Was Excellent, Met At The Door Greeted And Escorted To Our Seat Immediately. I Ordered The Chicken Fried Steak And Hash Browns Were Delicious. After Our Meal Was Finished We Were Once Again Met By The Gentleman At The Door With A Handshake Plus Thanking Us For Coming In. Will Be Back."}
{"text":"Once again, YELP does not disappoint. I was originally going to give Mr Mamas four stars, but then I could not come up with a good reason to not give them five stars. Visiting from Texas with my wife for a birthday weekend in Vegas, and wanting to get off the strip for a good honest breakfast, this place was a gem. Greeted at the door by friendly people, perfectly great waitress before we even ordered. Very large pancakes, eggs cooked exactly as I asked for. I actually came back on a business trip and had 4 co-workers tag along, and they all loved it! I switched up for the French toast this time and it was even better! Very fair prices as well! Thank you Mr Mamas for being in business!"}
{"text":"If you ever go to Vegas this is definitely a place you would want to check out!!! The food was amazing and the customer service was great! The long wait sucked and the seating is weird but it was worth it. The host was pretty funny he gave my friends and I a memorable trip , If you check it out and it's a guy their yelling names that's him! Cool cat"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and for a great price. We ordered five meals for 60$ . Not to shabby!!! We happy customers"}
{"text":"First time we went was for Mother's Day breakfast and obvious was going to be a long wait (why not this place is soo good) but we waited less than quoted time and we loved it. Took family that was in town to breakfast and they loved it, portions, flavor, service and staff were awesome. I would recommend going here, especially since I work in the same industry I say its amazing to dine to be at such a great ambiance while being taken care of. Service is quick and dishes are yumm. =) Definitely recommend!!!."}
{"text":"Drove by Mr. Mama's the other day, and recalled seeing some pretty favorable reviews.  
Saturday morning, my fella and I went out for breakfast, and we chose Mr. Mama's due to its super close location, and good reviews.  Ok, the $30 for $15 Yelp Deal sealed the deal for us. 

The first thing that struck me as great was that the owner greeted us,  took our name, since there was a short wait, but assured us that it would be less than 15 minutes.  It was about a 5 minute wait, which isn't bad at all.  

All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly, and pleasant.  
Our server was great, offering suggestions, and highlighting the specials.  

We ended up ordering: 
The Greek Omelette with hash browns and Texas Toast 
A side of Biscuits and Gravy
Clam Chowder
Grits
Philly Cheese steak
Coffee

The good: 
Free refills on the coffee, and your choice of french vanilla creamer or half and half.  I like this in a breakfast place.  I don't like to pay $2.50 a cup, when I have 2-2.5 cups...that's just too much.  So I liked the free refills option.

The Philly Cheese Steak was to DIE for.  Cooked perfectly, and perfectly seasoned. 

Now,the \"not bad, but not super good\" and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. 
The rest of our food was bland.  It was GOOD, but it wasn't seasoned well at all.  We had to add salt and pepper to everything...clam chowder, the omelette (even with all that feta), the grits, and the hash browns.  I normally don't ever add salt or pepper to my dishes, but these needed them.  
Everything else was great...the eggs were cooked perfectly, the grits were a trip back in time for me, to Nashville trips with my dad, and the biscuits and gravy were pretty good too.  We both really enjoyed the clam chowder as well. 

All in all, the trip was good.  We would have liked to have had better seasoning on most of the food, but it was still good.  

I'd come back, for sure.  There are lots of things on the menu that I'd like to try, and you really just can't beat the service!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place because of all the good reviews, and we love local breakfast places.  Honestly, I don't see what all the hullabaloo is about.  I had the bacon and eggs - eggs over easy - and hashbrowns well done.  The were good overall, although I've had better bacon.  My daughter's bacon was done better, so maybe they thought I wanted my bacon well done too.  The hashbrowns were great though.  My husband got some kind of omelet (I think a make your own, not sure), and the breakfast potatoes. . .after seeing my hashbrowns, he wished he'd ordered those instead because they were just ok.  For my little one, we were able to order just one pancake with bacon and they made it into a mickey shape, which she just loved.

We might be back again, I don't know . . . seems like the same food that you can get elsewhere.  I would recommend that if you decide to eat here, try to do it early.  We got there at 7:30 am, there were many people there then, but when we left after 8am, there were people waiting already."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the staff is FRIENDLY. Seriously- the BEST. The atmosphere was nice and clean. The food was just OKAY, not worth a drive across town in my humble opinion. If this place is in your immediate area-go for it."}
{"text":"We were making a quick visit to Vegas and searched for a good breakfast place outside the Strip. Not only was the food delicious but the service was great, everyone went out of their way to make sure everything had been taking care off.  We even met Mr. Mamas himself! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"We needed some food that wasn't on the strip at an end to a weekend in vegas. This place gave the perfect ambiance for the weary traveler!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great food very generous portions customer service is exceptional super friendly and attentive. I will definitely come back here on my next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"I had the omelette and home fries. I normally get hash browns, but I am glad I chose the home fries. They were all the perfect texture and seasoned well. Mr. Mama was greeting customers at the door and his commentary added to the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was very impressed by the level of service and food quality here! 

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by several staff which was a nice welcome. We came around 12pm on a Monday and it was packed but they were able to quickly get us a table. 

Literally, as soon as we sat down, a server asked for our drink order. Talk about fast service! Then, shortly after looking through the menu, another server came and took our order. It didn't take long for our food to be delivered  and the presentation was on point! 

I ordered the steak and eggs. I chose the potatoes over the hash browns and I had the option of adding peppers and onions. My steak was cooked perfectly well done with beautiful grill marks, eggs over easy and the potatoes were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Just absolutely tasty! The quality, taste and presentation was just perfection. 

Now, let's talk about the service. While we were waiting for our food, I observed a lot of the workers really engaging with every table. We were approached multiple times by multiple staff tending to our needs which made me feel like they really wanted to make sure we were taken care of. We were even asked if we wanted a photo which I thought was a nice gesture. They really live up to their slogan, \"Where you feel at home.\" 

Overall, the staff were very sincere with their interaction with everyone and very attentive to our needs. Most importantly,  excellent quality of food. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and it's safe to say that every where I go I order French toast for breakfast. I ordered the mommas French toast with ham and eggs and French toast and it was amazing! This is probably the best French toast I have ever had in my life. We were a party of 7 and that can be overwhelming in a full house as every seat was taken and people waiting. Our service was exceptional, I could hear the ladies game plan their day and how they will tend to customers. I had someone open the door for us as we were approaching from the staff. I cant say anything bad about this. Also, servings are big so come with an appetite."}
{"text":"Bobby Flay, watch out! These people make omelets that will rival any chef. From the initial greeting to an always smiling waitstaff I am always made to feel welcome. 

Mr Mama said to me\"I consider my only competition to be my four walls. If I take care of people inside, they'll want to return.\"  He's so right. I've been here three days in a row."}
{"text":"I occasionally dine here and have always loved the food and service from this fabulous establishment. But on this one particular visit, it was proven to me that this place is extraordinary.

My coworkers and I planned a very last minute get-together. We didn't know how many people would show and we needed a place to go dine. I suggested Mr. Mama's but fail to realize 1) it was a Sunday Morning 2) I didn't call ahead of time to attempt to make a reservation 3) we had children in the group. By the time we all showed up at the restaurant, we were a group of 10 guests. Unintentionally, I created a restaurant's worse nightmare.

But Mr. Mama shockingly pulled through. After being told it would be an hour wait. My group waited patiently outside. Within 30 minutes, we received a table. Within minutes of being seated, our orders were taken and food was served.

As concierge, my group and I, all knew what a difficult situation we put on the restaurant. But wow. Not only was the food excellent, the friendly service was still there.

Mr. Mama, you and your team are simply amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Service was cool but the food was just above average for diner food. Dont believe the hype."}
{"text":"What an excellent find.  Looking for an off the strip breakfast place and found the go to.  Busy with a wait on a Tuesday morning...so you know it is good.  Fairly basic menu with great food, but the service was soooo good.  Amazing to find such a well trained, happy staff and an owner who was walking through the restaurant to introduce himself and make sure all was good.  It was.  The owner was genuine and showed so much gratitude for his thriving business, his employees, and most of all his customers.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! 1st Time here and can't wait to try again!!! Highly recommend chicken fried steak! !"}
{"text":"Our server was Deneese, friendly gal, good knowledge of the menu and also gave me good substitution options. All staff members checked up on us to make sure we were ok.Portions are huge ! Dislikes: No one had name tags and for the price of the orange juice I wish it was freshly squeezed. I still love this place and will continue to recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place has as high of a rating as it does. Unless everyone was rating based on the service alone and not the food. Everyone was very nice and friendly opened the door both coming and going asked about our experience and genuinely seemed to care that we had a good experience but for me and my party of 3 the food and presentation was mediocre at best, bland, plain, tasted like warmed freezer good. Two of us got the biscuits and gravy with the potatoes and the third a bacon and cheddar omelet. There are much better options near by."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, we had to wait 30 min for a table for 6, but it was worth it. The breakfast burrito is amazing. Also the French toast is to awesome. Can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places for breakfast here in vegas

It's nice to see the awesome and energetic owners of Mr. Mamas serving and helping out on the floor. The service was spectacular the food came out a bit cold for me from what I remember but it was still really good. They are usually always busy."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Great food and great service.  Definitely would come back when in las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a fan! This place probably has one of the best pancakes in town. I ordered a short stack and it came in two huge pancakes that could feed a starving family of 4 somewhere in other parts of the world. The pancakes also came with eggs and bacon so you might want to stick with the short stack instead of the regular size. 

As with all breakfast places, it's packed during normal breakfast hours on the weekend. Expect a 30-45m wait."}
{"text":"Long ago outgrowing the limited confines of their previous location, a visit in September of 2014 finding the small and narrow restaurant completely full, Mr. Mama's relocated to the corner of South Jones and West Russell Road the following March, late Breakfast over two-years later still finding the mom 'n pop place packing 'em in from open to close with waits as long as an hour on weekends for food that is affordable and competent, no less and no more.

Inexplicably one of Las Vegas most heavily Yelped! Businesses, the only presumed reason being that low prices and big portions are a selling point for that particular demographic as the online deal offering $30 of food for a $15 pre-purchase expired long ago, it was with another adult plus a ten year old boy that the group checked in at the podium just past noon on a Saturday and waiting alongside four twenty-somethings who Uber'd from the Strip plus a couple passing through from Utah for nearly thirty minutes the scene was nothing short of controlled chaos, servers moving at a steady clip with a manager directing traffic while intermittently snapping pictures of another full house.

Eventually landing a table along the north wall of the restaurant, the current location not doing much to upgrade the décor but nearly tripling the number of seats with an equivalent increase in servers and kitchen size, it was by an identical menu from three years ago that diners were greeted, a few daily specials including Pancakes or French Toast slathered in canned Fruit Compote immediately passed over in favor of a two-plate and three sides order tallying just over $50 prior to tip.

Literally filled to capacity until their 2pm closing time, no waiting diners turned away but the Open/Closed sign flipped over and no further seating allowed after the designated time, it was with a small glass of Milk and two Iced Coffees that the table waited another thirty minutes after seating for the whole order to be delivered at once, the house \"Iced Coffee\" similar to McDonald's in that it comes with Cream and Sugar already added while the Hot Brew poured over Ice is watered down and weak, though both are offered with endless refills for just three dollars.

Interestingly hiding prices on their website, an odd choice as most of the diner-staples ring in at a pricepoint similar to the big chains or other locally owned joints such as EggWorks or The Cracked Egg, it was with the table quickly flooded that pictures were taken and share plates were passed, the \"Mama's Stack\" putting sides of Sausage and Scrambled Eggs on a separate plate as the fluffy triple-stack overlapped its dish with Strawberries and Whipped Cream strewn on top, the addition of Pure Maple Syrup from home again showing the Pancakes to be rife with Buttermilk, not too dense and among the best in town.

Moving next to the Chicken Fried Steak, not a typical order but considered to be one of Mr. Mama's signatures and interesting enough in that regard to justify its $12.95 cost inclusive of three sunny-side Eggs, an unfortunately dry Biscuit and previously-frozen Homefries, suffice it to say there is nothing light about Sausage Gravy atop a pounded piece of deep fried Beef and although fans of the dish may say this is as good as it gets the fact of the matter is that it is certainly an acquired taste that did not go over well with 2/3 of the table thanks to the thick and largely flavorless Country Gravy.

Mistakenly ordering an extra Biscuit, the addition of some honey definitely improving things to at least a point of edibility, those looking for something far better would do well to order one of Mr. Mama's famous $3.50 Cinnamon Rolls, the yeasty curl piping hot beneath thick frosting while a similarly priced side of Onion Rings is enough to go around the table several times with crisp batter and nary a hint of greasiness.  

**1/2:  A pleasant enough place, though clearly one who has generated a following by way of low prices as opposed to quality cuisine, Mr. Mama's reminds one of the sort of diner food that spawns big crowds after church in a small Midwestern town where creativity is for lack and abundance matters most.

FYI: Those looking to use coupons would be well advised to expect a wait, math not exactly a strong suit for the staff and the middle-aged male cook with a pot-marked face who may or may not be the owner clearly a loud and greedy man who does not understand the idea of 'fine-print.'"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went today with my boyfriend and two friends. Let me tell you. The food was incredible and the service was impeccable. The staff was so friendly and nice! We ordered the country fried steak and steak and eggs. So delicious and the servings were more than enough food. The manager, Kat, made our experience amazing and our server, Lourdes, was absolutely incredible and took amazing care of us. Even the gentleman who took down our name was really nice. I'm so happy we found a new local breakfast place to eat at on the weekends. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it's rated so high the breakfast burrito was watery and had barely any meat. The chicken fried steak was a frozen hunk of junk and the gravy is not good! We never were asked once how our meal was so I didn't tip and won't go back"}
{"text":"Our gps took us to the old location so you have to put in this address. This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. From the minute I walk in Shawn the host welcomes every person and does everything he can to make sure everyone waiting is informed and comfortable. The coffee is really good, actually the best I have had since I have been here. Now being born and raised in Tennessee, I have grown up with good gravy but this is different, a little sweet but amazing. And my eggs cooked perfect. Don't miss breakfast here, much better than the casino buffets and half the cost."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The 2 owners welcome every customers, who come in :) Tasty food with reasonable price! My favorite breakfast restuarant in Vegas... Lots of waitress and waiters ready to serve each customer with a smiling face and they are very approachable! If you want a good customer service, great food and reasonable price... you better try MR. MAMA'S BREAKFAST AND LUNCH!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from the time we were greeted until we left. Close enough to the strip to make the drive but far enough to avoid the traffic"}
{"text":"Love the food and the owner! This was my first time and I am a fan. I was looking for a new breakfast spot and checked out the yelp reviews and pictures for Mr. Mamas. left completely satisfied. Between the 6 of us we had french toast, biscuits and gravy, pastrami omelette, and pancakes. Love love love the french toast and I will go back for more real soon:)"}
{"text":"Amazing people, amazing service, amazing food. Down home deliciousness!  We are in town a few times a year and always come. Each time it's as good or better than the last. The waitress is so good she anticipates what you need before you even have to ask. Everything cooked perfectly. Seriously we can't say enough about this place!  Come and see for yourself! Xoxo!"}
{"text":"I was in town for 8 days and went to Mr Mama's 3 times. This place is amazing. I hope that when I come back next year they are just as good"}
{"text":"Great food, service was fast and friendly. The owner meets you at the door and check on you to make sure everything is to your liking.Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Greeted at the door. Service was good. Bacon was perfect.

Should add kids menu

Denisse was great!

Kitchen staff is entertaining 

Definitely a great breakfast addition to this side of town."}
{"text":"The food was Awsome we will be back.. Service was great .. I ordered the French toast with turkey bacon and a side order of grits ...This is my first time here ...I wish we had a place like this on Palmdale"}
{"text":"This place is a very popular and solid brunch choice in the Spring Valley/Enterprise area. It is crowded pretty much anytime it is open. However, the food is well worth the wait. It is made fresh to order and takes so little time to come out fresh that I couldn't believe it. We had our food maybe 5 minutes after we ordered it, and it was perfectly prepared. Everything was fantastic. We all ordered the pancakes and others got the hash or eggs and everything was delicious. Prices are very reasonable for brunch or breakfast. As someone who is a Waffle House fanatic, this could replace it in my breakfast favorites category. I only wish they had bigger tables so we could have fit more food on ours!"}
{"text":"Clean facilities. A very professional and efficient staff. Taste of food was excellent, and priced very fairly.

I am a fan of this establishment. I like them for the taste of their food and prices, but I love them for the way they operate. Efficient and friendly - So simple, but so many other business fail miserably at this."}
{"text":"Mr Mama's is awesome! Amazing service from the moment we walked in the door. Nice to get away from the tourist traps on the strip and find a local, reasonably priced, breakfast place. Hash brown's are bomb! Everything made from scratch! Will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and inexpensive. The customer service exceeded my expectations. If you're getting breakfast, I would try their pancakes or their omelets. They're delicious! For lunch, try their burgers or Philly Cheesesteaks. If you enjoy using ranch for a dipping sauce, you must try their homemade ranch. It was so good I had to take some home! If you haven't tried Mr. Mamas, you definitely have to add it to the top of your list for places to eat."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, hoping to get our 6 year old and 3 year old fed some good breakfast before we start our day. Went in and it was busy, my husband asked 1 of 3 ladies standing at the front register how long the wait was, 20 minutes, not too long. The customers who were there before us got seated. As we waited another customer, by himself, came in, put his name in and got seated at a 4 top before us in less that 3 minutes!!!!  Whaaattt?!?! And mind you, that table was open prior to him coming in. Why would seat a single customer before a family with 2 young children, who was there first?!?!  As we walked out, the employee that took our name asked us to please return cause they have a table ready for us in the CORNER!!! REALLY LADY?!?"}
{"text":"Me and the fam were visiting Vegas for Halloween weekend and wanted to get off the strip for a good breakfast.  We were all smiles at the great food and service at Mr. Mamas.  The staff was so accommodating to our requests and super friendly.  It felt like a real family style business.  THE FOOD!  Just amazing.  We were so stuffed when we left.  The best part was that we got awesome food and awesome service for super low prices.  Whether you're a Vegas local or just visiting Mr. Mamas is definitely a must do!  Try the pancakes or the omelets.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, our favorite breakfast spot in LV. Can't be any better. New location is awesome. Lots more space and the same great prices. Nick (Mr. Mama) is a gem. California Omelette still leads the way here"}
{"text":"Great customer service my food is always so good every time I pick it up they have it ready in the door always open because there's someone there to open it keep it up guys I love the breakfast burrito is very good"}
{"text":"I'm writing this last review as a reply to the owner Nick concerning the situation that happened last Saturday. You claimed that you were never informed about the potato being rotten but that is actually false. As I exited the bathroom the first thing I heard from your voice was loud and clear, \"Are you going to pay?\" This is before me and my boyfriend were able to explain anything. I remember because I was actually upset and crying and none of your employees stopped to ask what was wrong. Except the manger, but I assume he felt like his hands were tied behind his back in this situation. After you asked such an off-setting question Daniel was feeling extremely upset because of how upset I was from placing a rotten potato in mouth. Clearly he did not have the answer you wanted or even had an answer at all at first because it was such bad timing. Daniel told me that he did in fact present the potatoes to you in a napkin that you grabbed and threw away and you told him to leave if he wasn't paying. Now if I'm being honest, me and Daniel never had any intention of not paying we just wanted to know what happened to the potatoes but it seemed like us not paying was your only concern which escalated the situation. Daniel is nowhere near a violent person but on the other hand you were in his face and you did physically rush him to leave the store from \"not paying\". You threaten him by claiming you were an ex fighter, you never gave him person space while leaving the store and you shouted telling us to get out. I felt like my boyfriend was in a position that any human would have gotten extremely upset in. And this is a scene which all of your employees and customers witnessed but it's a shame if they agree with us they could lose their job so of course the situation is biased. I even have pictures of me and Daniel having a wonderful (non threatening) time in your restaurant right before the incident, which if I can figure out how to post them I will. We also loved our waiter and my Jenna wrap was perfect so basically the situation could've been a lot different if you had just put the customer first instead of counting pennies and being so concerned about us paying or not. But right now it's your word against ours but the situation is now in the past. We just felt like  after the cops left our side of the story was not being heard or understood. (The cops did agree with me and Daniel that you were a hot head even towards them but that is besides the point.) Like I said in the beginning this was one of our top 5 breakfast joints until this terrible memory that I will never be able to look past. 

(This is an update from re-reading your first reply, I would also like to clarify that we were never charged with anything from the cops so that is a false statement from you. The cops let us go because they realized how ridiculous the entire encounter was. If we were truly being as threatening as you claim then the cops would have taken different precautions. Thank you and goodbye.)

{"text":"Perfect atmosphere for what is. Great service. Best of all, great food. There is no doubt this would be a top breakfast place anywhere you go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been dying to try Mr Mamas after all the stellar reviews, praises, and high ratings. However, I'm not a breakfast type of person. I eat breakfast foods now and then but I'm not totally crazy about it like some are. I do appreciate a good omelet though.  

My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday for lunch about an hour before they closed. When we got there, the whole place was packed but luckily, people were getting ready to leave. And we weren't the only ones that were coming in too. There was a couple before us and a couple of people after us as well. This just goes to show that Mr Mamas consistently has customers through the day. 

My boyfriend and I decided to share the Spanish Omelet with ham, 1 slice of French Toast, and a greek yogurt parfait. 

When our Spanish omelet came, I was a little confused. I could've sworn that I ordered it with ham but instead of ham, there was bacon. Granted, it was close to closing time so there might have been a mistake here or there with the kitchen rushing the orders out. I didn't say anything bout the mishap only because I didn't want to wait for it to be redone so we stuck it through. I mean, I guess bacon is sort of like ham...they're both pork. *Shrugs.* There were also hash browns that came with the omelet and we had specifically requested well done hash browns. I like my hash browns crispy on the outside and warm goodness on the inside. The hash browns did not look as well done as the pictures we've seen but it was still good nonetheless. It was probably some of the best hash browns I've had in Vegas. 

I love how Mr Mamas allows you to order pancakes and French toast by the slices. I don't like pancakes but if my friend or boyfriend does, they can order just a slice or two since I won't help them eat it. As for French toast, I like them but I don't like them enough to gobble a whole order. I haven't had French toast in ages and I've almost forgotten what they taste like. French toast holds a comforting place in my heart -- I used to make them with my uncle when I was a young girl. Unfortunately, Mr Mamas does run short for their French toast. It doesn't quite bring about the comfort feelings but it is still good -- just not something I would order again. It seemed a little plain to me. I might enjoy it more if it had options for whip cream and strawberries. 

Their greek yogurt parfait was beautiful and possibly my favorite order of the day. It was loaded with mixed berries and granola. It was the perfect healthy breakfast -- can't really go wrong with that! 

Overall, Mr Mamas, to me, was good but not the best. Perhaps I walked in with super high expectations and with that, it's hard to satisfy me. Nothing here gave me a huge surprise and nothing made me crave for more. One of the bonus things about Mr Mamas is that it is not pricey .. definitely great to dine with a family! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place! Fabulous service from the minute we walked up to the door. Great breakfast choices. I ordered an omelet without the meat it came with and the server offered a substitute immediately. Same with the toast I didn't want. Everyone in my party enjoyed their food. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Best!!!! Consistently fantastic. Never feel like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such a hard to find hole-in-the-wall (in a good way) I have been here at least 10 times and never once regretted anything I've ordered! Mama burger is king! The 1 and only reason this isn't a 5 star place is its a little small. Pretty much everytime you come here expect a 20+ minute wait. The first time I went there it was 50 minutes. FIVE ZERO minutes. I heard last time they were moving to a different location but no word on how big the place is. Hope its 2-3x as big to lessen the wait. No matter what I will return here time and time again~"}
{"text":"Mama Mia! This place is delicious!

Hubby & I were out and about the other morning (shocker). It's a good thing too since we were able to grab breakfast here. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which I didn't mind. A busy restaurant usually translates to good food. This was absolutely true for Mr. Mama's!

I ordered the Spanish Omelet subbed with egg whites. It's an extra charge for egg whites, but that's standard. The omelet itself had Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, spinach and avocados. Let me first say that the portions are HUGE! I only finished half of my omelet and took the rest home. It was sooo tasty too. Super cheesy and packed with layers of spinach.

Omelets come with a side of hash browns or \"house fries\". We both ordered hash browns, but Hubby switched to house fries later on. The name is misleading since they are actually seasoned potatoes. Anyways, both of our sides were good and came with a choice of toast as well. All for a fair price I might add.

As far as breakfast goes, Mr. Mama truly knows his stuff! I might just convert to a morning person if it means we can eat here more often. ;-)"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here and has been great both times we were here. Shawn is very friendly and makes you feel welcomed! He keeps it nice and cool inside with the outside tempature 110 plus it is great to enjoy your meal inside a nice cool place. It gets busy fast but don't worry it is worth the wait and both times we were sat quicker than we were told. Great place we will be back!"}
{"text":"Good, hearty food. Had the veggie wrap, which comes with salsa. Delicious! Friendly, efficient staff. High reviews are warranted!"}
{"text":"Super awesome service and food at Mr Mamas. I'm in town for a wedding and decided to check it out based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed! The French toast and hash browns were amazing and everything came out very promptly. Claudia was great and helped me navigate the menu and choose an awesome meal."}
{"text":"YES!! FINALLY! My first place in Vegas worthy of a FULL 5 stars! If I could give more, I would! This is how breakfast should be throughout the entire city! Came here off the reviews (thanks yelp!) and wasn't disappointed.

We walked in and were pleasantly greeted by the hostess. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, gave me a sample of the gravy to try. So I got a mama's stack with eggs and sausage and my wife got eggs & turkey bacon with a single pancake.

First off, I must give this disclaimer, the pancakes are HUGE! Don't make the mistake I made and underrate them like I did. I could've easily filled up off a short stack. Not only are they big but they're fluffy as tasty. The eggs and sausage was great as well. Coffee tasted amazing! The waitress even gave us cups to go. This place has breakfast and Customer service to a T. Trust me, COME HERE for breakfast. You WON'T regret it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, as soon as you walk in the door you're greeted by the owner of the establishment and he checked in on us the whole time to make sure we were being taken care of. The food is awesome and you get generous portions for a great price which is much more than I can say for most of the restaurants on the Las Vegas strip. I highly recommend the cinnamon roll in the ABC omelette and it was great. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mama's Breakfast Burrito with bacon.  They did a fantastic job cooking it and the wrap was not oily.  Absolutely loved it.  The wait staff was courteous and genuine.  Made me feel really welcome.  Would recommend to everyone who wants good breakfast and nice people."}
{"text":"Super customer service. Nice clean restaurant, no need for fancy decor. 
We didn't order anything out of the ordinary. I got the Mr. Mama Short Stack, came with 2 eggs, meat of choice (BACON!), and 2 pancakes; and not little pancakes, big pancakes for less than $8. Doug got the Steak and Eggs; small rib eye steak with 2 eggs, potatoes and toast for $10. We both liked our food and I feel like the prices are cheaper than many breakfast joints in town. We did buy the Yelp deal which is a kick ass offer.
We had a couple of friends with us that got a Breakfast Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy (they add maple syrup to their gravy, interesting!), unfortunately weren't as pleased with their food as we were.
Me and my husband would definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Wow!!!
Super friendly folks work here!! Everyone was nice. The G-R-A-V-Y!!! It has sausage, bacon, and Maple syrup!! Next time I need to get biscuits and gravy to go!! I had the chicken fried steak and eggs! Amazing!! I drove from the other side of town and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We ate there on a Tuesday morning. This place was busy.  We were seated right away.  A lady came over to our table introduced herself as the manager. Our server arrived shortly. We both ordered 2 eggs scrambled hard with bacon.  Our order in about 7 minutes.  The eggs were scramble hard as ordered and the bacon was cooked fine. However the eggs were cold. I believe the eggs were cooked first and waited for the bacon.  Our server stopped by shortly and inquired as to how was everything. I let he know, my eggs were cold. She apologized, and wanted to have two more eggs cooked.  I said no thank you, I did not want to wait.  The manager arrived to our table and again, I explained the eggs were cold. She to apologized and wanted to replace the eggs and again I declined. She said she was not sure how it happened as to the order was be place under a heat lamp. I finished my meal.  Upon receiving my bill they gave me a $3.00 credit for the cold eggs."}
{"text":"Food was Delicious And fantastic service both days, really friendly place. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"First meal in Vegas. Great way to start to trip. Just awesome, food and service. Its home be hard tho top this one"}
{"text":"staff- amazing. bacon- perfect. eggs- excellent job achieving 'over medium'. french toast- total fail, not enough batter and not well cooked, it was like having plain bread. coffee- bitter and gross, no amount of creamer could save it. all in all I like the place and wish them well, having good staff makes all the difference."}
{"text":"This is a lovely gem in southwest Vegas.  When they say homemade, they mean it! 

If you like poofy-fluffy pancakes, this is your Mecca! And they are huge! If you normally get a full-stack, get a short-stack... You've been warned! 

Eggs Benny was quite tasty (tho the hollandaise could use more lemon)

The chicken fried steak is pretty darn good,  for not being made in Texas . But it was homemade-breaded in-house... So total kudos! 

Hashbrowns seriously rock: crispy, flaky and tasty. 

French toast was good, and if you do not very soft inside (the way my friend likes), then these are fabu! 

The bacon was beautifully crisp and awesome... Sadly, none of us liked the sausage (kind limp and bland) 

Finally... Customer service was 120% awesome!  Kat, one of the managers was super polite and helpful, and a genuinely lovely lady.  Lourdes, our server, was wonderfully attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is good first for the customer service. How many times would you find a successful eat out business owner greeting you and holding your door?? This was my first time .... well the point I'm trying to make is customer service lingers goes longer than the exchange of dollars for food. That said the breakfast was fresh, tasted good  and staff was very warm as well. Definitely recommend you to check this place. I'd go back for sure if visiting Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"I'll give this place a three stars for food taste. It didn't deliver the flavor that I expected for a 4.5 stars, sorry. It's just all hype!!!! I ordered corned beef hash, salty to my standard, taste is blah, texture is weird. Hubby ordered chicken fried steak and gravy. Again, flavor of the steak and gravy is average. Honestly, other regular diners tasted better. Wait is between 25 minutes to 40 depending on the time of the day. The only thing 4stars is service."}
{"text":"The food at Mr. Mamas was awesome!!! I got the hash brown and eggsmy husband got the country fried steak!!;) 
My experience here was wonderful because the owner and staff were very accommodating...thank you!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. But you have to get here early. Everything is really good here. We have had the biscuits and gravy, pancakes, omelettes, etc. very friendly staff. Always a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"*First and foremost they have Great service. They are really friendly and attentive. 
*The wait was not bad, but then again I did come during the week and we were a party of 6 ppl. 
I don't know how the wait is on the weekends.
*The food was not bad, I really liked their hash browns and toast. As a bonus the plates are a good size and the pancakes are big. 

In the end, service was good, food was good, and affordable."}
{"text":"Where do I even start. Easy to find.right off the strip.... Very welcoming..opening doors.. Accommodating to our large family. Every one in there are so super friendly and it is the little things..  Plastic silverware for our 1 and a half year old so he could play with it without the bang on the table.. Food was oh my amazing! One ordered chicken fried steak..another one the breakfast burrito...also biscuits and gravy and a Denver omelette..all in our party was so very pleased with what they ordered. We saw pancakes come out of the kitchen that looked amazing! Portions are nice size .. Hard to eat it all ... The gravy is different and they offer to let you try it before getting it and wow was it good! Sausage..bacon...so very tasty. Ask for Tamara ! She was fabulous! One last thing .. this restuarant was so very clean! They are always cleaning ...condiments on table look brand new! You will not be disappointed for coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try out a breakfast spot I have never been before and chose Mr. Mama's. Great choice. Simple place with a solid breakfast/brunch menu, great service (who still opens the door for you and greets you as part of the standard sequence of service? They do and it is a nice touch) and food quality was on point. Was seated quickly, approached with out a wait by Alex the server, received some menu suggestions based off of a few quick questions, seamlessly placed my order and received my order within minutes. I have waited longer at fast food restaurants for my order in the past. The Corned Beef Hash was very good, house made, full of flavor; my only suggestion would be to have a texture component (a crisp seared crust would have sent it over the top, but don't get me wrong, it is a destination menu item as is).  Doing a great job team Mr. Mama's, I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service. The manager Kat deserves a pat on the back for how well she runs the place. We were very happy."}
{"text":"We had the best experience for breakfast here on our recent LV vacation.  The owner greats you at the door and seats you.  He also checks on the service periodically throughout your dining experience.  The best service ever.  Now for the food...... My husband had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  The gravy is clearly homemade with sausage and maple syrup in it.  Yumm.  I had my favorite corned beef hash and eggs also done to perfection."}
{"text":"Wanted to have breakfast outside of a hotel/casino. Party of six adults we ordered pancakes, French toast, corn beef hash, eggs and bacon, steak and eggs, country fried steak, and mushroom omelette. Okay so the person that ate the 
Country fried steak- was  \"alright, and the gravy was alright\"
Eggs and bacon- \"very good, bacon delicious, and toast perfect!\"
Steak and eggs-\"good\"
Omelette- \"great!\"
Corn beef hash-\"good, not excellent or great but good, a little gristly\"
So a basic breakfast house, but four stars for being clean, although it's packed, service is fast, very friendly environment. Would come back."}
{"text":"They opened the door for us coming and going with a friendly smile. The owner was very friendly. The food was delicious and was served surprisingly fast  (5 minutes ). There's a large flat screen tv and plenty of space. The server takes your order on a phone app so while you're giving your order the guys in the kitchen immediately start cooking it. This was my first time here and definitely won't be my last."}
{"text":"Yelped \"breakfast\" and mr mamas was the first place that came up and I must say awesome pick yelpers! My friend and I definitely enjoyed our breakfast and will be coming back for breakfast! Keep up the delicious food guys!"}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service I've ever experienced. Denise was our server and she made sure that we had everything we needed. She offered things that I didn't have to ask and I didn't think of asking for at the moment but I would have later if she didn't ask... like butter for my French toast, splitting the bill with my friend, more water, and if everything was fine. Workers here all looked happy and they were all very helpful. As soon as a table left, they worked in teams to clean out the tables (my friend remarked that  she felt like she was in the game like diner dash). They were swift without being distracting to other customers. The food was remarkable as well! French toast wasn't soggy neither was it too sweet... You get a lot for your money and a pleasant experience... You'll want to come back... I know I do."}
{"text":"Excellent Food!  Our waitress, Lourdes, was great.  We had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Corned Beef Hash.  Very good!  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Non-stop service!  Warmly welcomed and service is so important to me. I had the eggs benedict and my guy had the sausage and biscuits with gravy. Both dishes lacked flavor unfortunately. Used to the downhome southern flaky biscuit and creamy flavorful sausage gravy and while this was ok- I believe it missed the mark. Also the hollandaise was bland but the egg was poached nicely. Would love to make this my #1 breakfast spot but the flavors have to improve. Might come again and try something else."}
{"text":"Best place ever. So good I had  to stop eating to write this review.. the owner is awesome.  The food is great"}
{"text":"After hearing all the raves from fellow Yelpers and a friend about this place, I just couldn't resist taking my nom squad to this joint. And I'm totally glad I did that because all of us loved it. A buddy and I split our orders of country fried steak and eggs and The Stack and I'm salivating as I'm typing this. I guess I'm just addicted to fried food since I can't get enough of that crunchy scrumptious country fried meat soaked in egg yolk (insert drooling face here). The buttery stack of golden pancakes also had me doing the tippy toe dance on the inside with each bite that I took. Everything was simply amazing. Others of us in the group ordered breakfast burrito, omelettes, and a bunch of other orders that I can't recall. I didn't get to try their dishes but everyone were satisfied with their dishes. 

Those who have found this place disappointing must've either A) went there on an off-day for the chef, or B) discovered a much better gem that I've yet to venture to (share some info!). As for me and the squad, we left happily rounder than when we entered. I'm glad to mark down another off-the-strip Vegas foodies gem!"}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly staff and great food. What they do with their biscuits is absolute genius! (I won't spoil it for you by describing it, you have to experience it.) Not many places make me giddy just by eating there, but this is one of them. If I had an extra hand I'd give Mr. Mamas three thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price, awesome service and wonderful staff. Was greeted at the door by the owner, who also thanked me and my friend as we left. Overall an awesome experience, I will definitely be back and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"SHOUT OUT TO THE MANAGER she gave us the best customer service I have ever had in my life! You the best!

We ordered basically the entire menu and were over the moon and not disappointed with ANYTHING we ate. I even had the cinnamon roll 2 days later and it was sooooo good!

My favorite thing about this place was the quality for the price and the portion size. All fantastic and I will now dream of their chunky thick bacon until I am able to be reunited with that heavenly cut of meat."}
{"text":"This is a well run establisement! The service was excellent fast and friendly. It's worth the drive from the strip. One issue I had was the saltiness of the corned beef I mentioned it to the server she did explain to me that cured meat has a tendency to be salty lol. I honestly think someone made an uh oh on this particular batch. I'm the saltiest person in three states if I say it's salty. It's salty! None the less this place is really good."}
{"text":"The owner is absolutely amazing so personable greets every single person walking in the door just left him the food is great as well but the owner is what makes his place special"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, price..  This place is a go-to every time we go to Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Arrived a bit before 9 on a Saturday morning. One of the employees (I'm assuming an owner/manager) opened the door for me and greeted me with a smile. I was seated immediately and asked by a host if I wanted a beverage. Our waitress came a few minutes later and introduced herself.

While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, our waitress would come by and ask if there was anything I wanted while I waited and I had any questions. I was already super impressed by the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff.

Once my friend arrived, our waitress explained the day's specials and gave us time to select our items. When we were ready to order, she was within waving distance. I got the egg, cheese, meat sandwich on their homemade biscuit, which was delicious. Definitely recommend the biscuit! I also got the potatoes, which were called home fried (or something similar). I prefer more seasoning on my potatoes, so I think I'll go for the hashbrowns next time. You have the option to get the potatoes fried or grilled, which is neat! My friend got the blueberry pancakes, which were amazing (I tried a bite). Light and super fluffy! I think I'll get them next time!!

My friend and I stayed and chatted well into the busy Saturday morning rush (the waiting area had begun to fill up when we left around 10:30am), but we never once felt pressure to leave due to the crowd. While I completely understand when a restaurant asks you to wrap things up due to a crowd; it's really nice to eat at a place where you can feel like you can take your time and chill with a friend.

The service was great and the food was delicious! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"From the moment you open the door to enter into Mr. Mamas you are greeted with sincerity, enthusiasm and the utmost of cordiality. You are seated quickly and then the real experience begins.
The menu is All-American food that is basic and void of any of the trendy things that you don't understand.
The food is extremely well prepared, abundant, and always served quickly and hot.
The service is excellent with friendly yet not intrusive servers and Bus staff. Your coffee cup is never empty.
The restaurant is well ventilated, well lit, and very comfortable seating at any table you chose. It is immaculately clean and very well staffed with more staff than is commonly seen in average restaurants.
We are committed to eventually ordering everything on the menu because we will visit Mr. Mamas once per week at the minimum. When you find a well run exceptional business, there is no need to look any further. We have found that business and will be very loyal to Mr. Mamas for years to come."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mr. mama's. Great and delicious food for a great price!!! I like the pancakes, California and Greek omelettes."}
{"text":"This is one of those highly rated, frequently visited Yelp places with lots of reviews and I can see why. The food here like the service is wonderfully good. I had the fattening chicken fried steak and I would do it again an again. I saw the the pancake and egg omelets, burritos, burgers coming out of that kitchen all looking delicious. I gave it a 5 rating, because there wasn't a 4.5. However, it was fun and lots of great eating going on"}
{"text":"Everything was so spot on, from the food to the excellent service, that I can't even put into words how amazing this place is. Super nice staff, and the best damn cinnamon roll I've ever had!! It was good to have a home cooked that I didn't cook myself!"}
{"text":"Visited Mr. Mama during my holiday stay in Vegas on 12/29/2015.  Found it had very good reviews on Yelp.   Wanted to try someplace off the strip so we ventured out there.  Not very far of of Tropicana Ave.  When we first got there the host, assuming it was Mr. Mama, told us it would be a 30 minute wait.  My husband usually doesn't like to wait that long but we were visiting so I think he was okay with staying.  It didn't take 30 minutes though- 15 minutes tops.  Place was busy.  Service was great.  Food very good.  Would go back.  I had the French toast special I think it was called.  Included eggs and one choice of meat.  4 pieces of french toast, 3 eggs, several pieces of bacon.   Who could ask for more?!  My husband had chicken fried steak at the recommendation of our waitress.  He couldn't finish it...that is saying a lot for him.  It was just too big!  Good though according to him."}
{"text":"Mr. Mama's  breakfast was amazing. The hospitality and great service is a plus. We will be coming back soon. Please try the chicken fried steak...."}
{"text":"Had another fabulous delious breakfast yesterday at my favorite restaurant....saw all my extended family and friends....Thank you Nick for your expertise....your all great."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food great, decor nice and people that work there are awesome!! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The portions were huge.  The owner was amazing providing customer service and managing the crowd.  The coffee and eggs Benedict were excellent."}
{"text":"A breakfast worth the trip to Vegas. Off the strip but worth the trip. Fresh ingredients rule the morning. Greek omelets that don't skimp on the olives. golden hash browns and bacon beckons you. Lift your head off that pillow put on a robe and make your way to the best first meal of the day."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!?!?! This place has become a must stop when I am in Vegas. It is worth every second of the 12 mins drive from the strip. Place is clean, service excellent, food to die for, helping way to big (not complaining) and price penny's!!! See you next time I'm town because I'll be stopping by."}
{"text":"Uhh-MAZING customer service!  The people running this joint are absolutely delightful(: 
The manager, Kat , personally greeted us at our table and gave her recommendations- which I love a busy lady who makes time to have small talk with a new patron!  A special shout out to Alex for being so accommodating with our meal!(: As a matter of fact, I think at one point or another every team member from the front of the house either greeted us, checked on us to make sure the food was good, or thanked us for coming while on our way out- this is an outstanding set of waitstaff and you should consider yourself lucky to be in their section! 

The seating in this place is well thought out. Though it may be a small diner, they certainly value guest comfort over all else. The entrance is a bit crowded- CUZ EVERYONE WANTS TO EAT HERE(for a good reason). But once you get your table, sit down, you realize that there is so much space! They could fit a few more tables to make money; but don't, and I am so appreciative that I could stretch or scoot my chair back WITHOUT hitting someone behind. 

The food was just heavenly! Management of this facility is so confident in their recipes, they give out free samples of all kinds of things- great marketing tactic! Just look at the pictures posted- it is EXACTLY what you will get when ordering!

No BS, no games, great food, great people and great prices! Totally worth the wait for a table!!(: 

Ten out of ten guys, thank you for a wonderful breakfast!!

Sincerely, the J's/ feather necklace girl"}
{"text":"I love corned beef and their corned beef hash is homemade and their sandwiches are full of lean meat. I'm a regular for the love of the food.  Their service is very attentive and they always make me feel at home."}
{"text":"That sausage gravy!!! I don't even like gravy, but that sausage gravy with the biscuit is the bomb.com. Must try! Came here for brunch after a long night out on the strip, and it was some much needed delicious food! 
There was a 30-40min wait when we got there around 11:30am, which was no big deal seeing as it was lunch time. 
Customer service was awesome. The host was hilarious- he was so extra with the picture taking and I loved it. Our waitress was so nice and courteous. Our food came out quickly too."}
{"text":"It would be hard to make this place any better. The people are so tuned into their customers it should be a training ground for the finest restaurants. The style is simple and clean but the service and food are top notch. I like a simple atmosphere myself so that is a positive to me also. Claudia was our server and she exemplifies empathy and alertness above almost any I have encountered.
Bravo Mr. Mama you have topped my list."}
{"text":"Papi & I got the veggie omelet Witt PJ chz & mamas sandwich no avocado. Delicious!  Excellent customer service family atmosphere!  Home cooked food!!"}
{"text":"This breakfast place was amazing! I ordered the biscuits and gravy! The server let us try the homemade gravy before ordering. It's not your usual gravy. Mr. Mama came to our table to greet us. The coffee was hot and constantly flowing. We also ordered chili burger. The burger was an 8/10. We will be back."}
{"text":"Place is fantastic.   Only thing that was tough bout it is its way off the strip.  Taxi was $23 from planet hollywood.

Their homemade hash is great as well as their hash browns.  Breakfast is pretty cheap though so it was well worth the trip"}
{"text":"Wow y'all, this place has both great food and super friendly Service. You have to try the homemade biscuits and gravy. Amazing!!!!! Run don't walk."}
{"text":"Best place to come and worth the wait. This place beats anything on he strip. Come here everytime we visit Las Vegas and will continue to bring friends and family."}
{"text":"We came here so excited based on the reviews to have breakfast! Even though we had to wait 40 minutes to be seated, excitedly we didn't even mind! The owner greeted us very kindly! The hostess and the waitress were both very nice but the food was tasteless and not worthy of the reviews! My goodness I ordered the veggie omelet and with egg whites! I only ate half of it because I was very hungry and left the rest! My husband ordered the California omelet and he couldn't eat more than half of it as well. The potatoes were dry and overly done! Thank goodness I gave them to my husband..... after we left surprised to what we just ate and how is this possible to be so bad based of high reviews, I had to go to Starbucks to grab a latte and a energy bar!
We travel a lot and we know good food! My husband makes the best eggs and omelets! This place lacked flavor, quality and nothing to brag about! It makes me mad to have wasted our time to eat here.
Did they change cooks? I mean even if they did, the recipe should stay the same? I'm just shocked!"}
{"text":"Basic. 
Cramped dining area, I had several people brush up against me just to get through. 
I found a piece of cooked macaroni in my scrambled eggs.. that was cool. 
Eggs didn't taste like they were cooked to order. 
Was very surprised our food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered. 
Staff was efficient and friendly. 
It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good enough to entice me to return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. We went on a mini vacation with the kiddos and we stumbled on Mr. Mama's through Yelp. The food is delicious with large portions. My son and I shared a Mamas Stack, and we had food left over. The customer service was superb. Kat, the manager, came over and personally introduced herself and made excellent menu recommendations. My 9 year old son was so impressed he leaned over and whispered, \"Mom they have great customer service.\" I highly recommend. We will be back on our next Las Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food was just ok...country fried steak was terrible so was the chili..but the omletts and pancakes seems to be good..nothing too special though"}
{"text":"First time there went to have breakfast, staff is really friendly and manager took the time to greet everyone who was waiting and gave suggestions on her personal favorites, she went to our table and welcomed us even shook our hand which I've never seen a manager do when welcoming her guests, definitely going back, the wait was a little over an hour but you don't even feel it because the vibe there is so family friendly, so well worth the wait AMAZING food."}
{"text":"Great Vegas gem. I had the eggs benedict it was great my lovely one had the Denver omelet portions were huge prices were great nice spot to have breakfast on a weekend morning or weekday morning staff is very inviting and the place has a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great breakfast option in Las Vegas. A bit away from the strip but worth the drive. Excellent customer service, great prices, delicious food. We always try to visit at least once per trip to Vegas. Biscuits and gravy are one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"Mr Mama's is a truly delightful experience.  From the moment you walk in the door Nick and his staff treat you so well.  I felt like I was family.  I've been there 4 times on my last two visits to Las Vegas and each time we've had great food, great service and a warm friendly atmosphere. It just doesn't get any better than Mr.  Mama's."}
{"text":"Everything was beyond expectations. Believe me, I sampled every ones plate. Biscuits and gravy, steak and eggs  Call ahead to trim down the wait time. The locals mob this place. Service is excellent. Great spot for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Great service! Make their own pancake batter and you sure can taste the difference. I really enjoyed the omelette- which is unusual as I am usually bored by them. Very affordable and great staff. Certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the new location with more room and faster seating.  Great food as always and a must stop in Vegas.  Staff are always sooo friendly.  My wife had french toast and I had the short stack.  Mmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service I have ever had from any restaurant EVER! The food was great, huge portions, good quality, reasonably priced. I would absolutely go here again!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place of all time !! I recently moved to the area about 4 months ago and decided to try this place out after finding them on yelp, been hooked ever since. 4 1/2 stars does not do justice!! This place is nothing short of 5 stars !
First I have to say the service is something out of this world. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant with better service.. they are very friendly and personable and make you feel right at home.  EVERY single employee seems happy to be here.. even when it gets crazy crowded they work very well as a team. (So rare these days) 
The food is ALWAYS on point , even when we order for pick up, by the time we get home and finally get to eat, the food is still warm and just as delicious !  

My fave is the Denver omelette and OMG they have the best bacon everrr! But you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu . 

Great service, great food at a great price... what more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"Before my wife and I got to the door the owner opened the door for us and greeted us so warmly and friendly that I told him I just felt like shaking his hand.  He was super friendly as well as the rest of the staff.  After sitting down I realized he was sitting at a table with someone having a conversation and when customers were coming to the restaurant he would jump up to greet them and was always smiling.  There was an older lady that was walking to the door and he jumped up, went outside and walked her into the restaurant.  That alone will have me coming back.  Customer service in this country is a dying art.  The owner of this place seems to have nailed it.  
I ordered the corn beef hash, eggs, hash browns and biscuits with gravy.
The corn beef was interesting.  It seemed kind of crumbly.  I don't know how to describe it.  Biscuits and gravy were pretty good.  I have had their chicken fried steak on a previous visit.  That was one of the best chicken fried steaks I have ever had and it's a pretty huge portion.  I will definitely be back to this place.  Great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"I've been here for a total of 7 minutes and I already love this place. The staff alone and their friendly demeanor is already worth the five star rating!!"}
{"text":"U would better fogging going anywhere else the owner needs to be in the kitchen showing his staff how to cook"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. I had the eggs Benedict and my wife has the French toast. The breakfast was totally worth it. The staff is also very friendly. After breakfast the manager walks up and asks every table how the food was. Very impressive. And oh yes, don't miss the cinnamon roll. Save space for it at the end!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best breakfast food I have ever had! From the front of the building it looks like an office space because of the tinting on the windows, but the inside is a casual open dinning room with a medium sized kitchen serving up some awesome food! I had the mama's French toast which includes three eggs any way you want and a choice of bacon or sausage etc.. Every bite of my food was fantastic... the eggs were cooked perfectly as well as the bacon! I will definitely be back when I take a trip to Vegas again! Awesome service too!"}
{"text":"These people have amazing customer service skills. So friendly and they make sure that you are their priority. The food was tasty.
 The coffee was filled often, good creamers and all the major sweeteners. 
The western omelet was great, as were the chocolate chip pancakes. 
The hash browns were crispy, but not over cooked. Everyone smiles at you and someone is always ready to take care of you. 
Thanks, Mr Mama!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best breakfast place in town. Greeted when you first step in the restaurant to great customer service with the waitress. We had the biscuit and homemade gravy along with the Mamas Stack which were in good big portions and so delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I honestly have no complaints. We did have to wait about 30 mins but it was Sunday so that's normal. But the service was great and the food was great. I had the french toast and it was good. The portion sizes were very large and reasonable prices. It's a great off the strip option. None of the fuss and all of the goodness. There's also parking. I'd recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Friend said he had the best club sandwich here (the mama sandwich). The egg Benedict florine with dark forest ham are just hit the spot."}
{"text":"Overall we had great food and great service. Prices were reasonable as well. The atmosphere is casual and everyone is very friendly. We were a party of four. Three of us got omelettes and I got the strawberry pancakes (special) . They give very good ( big ) portions. Everything was prepared very well & the food tasted very good"}
{"text":"Back again! My boyfriend and I always come here to eat when we visit Vegas! It's our go to place for some great food and reasonable prices. Would highly recommend if you can get away from the Strip."}
{"text":"The customer service was incredible from the jump we where greeted at the door by one hostess and quickly seated. The waitress was very informative and very nice. The place is very clean and all the workers are very nice. I ordered the homemade corn beef and hash it came with 2 eggs and hash browns and a side order of there chicken fingers and fries. Both meals where very tasty and the food was delivered hot and ready in 10 minutes. I would definitely come back here again great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing breakfast. Do yourself a favor and get the cinnamon roll, even if it's for the table to share, you'll thank me. My dad and I split the Marty wrap and it was delicious. So much food. My husband got a breakfast sandwhich and loved it. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Mr Mama's hooked it up for breakfast. Is it too early for a chicken fried steak? Hell, no. I enjoyed the egg wraps (breakfast burrito with chile) while others in the party feasted on pancakes. It's professional short order spot, a very cool off-strip option. Do yourself a favor, get out of the matrix and go to Mr Mama's for legit southwestern start to your day."}
{"text":"Great food, and very friendly service!! Lourdes was our server, she was very sweet and took great care of us :)"}
{"text":"OMG! 
You will not believe the experience I just had at MR.MAMAS !

From the time you step to the front door you are greeted with a warm and inviting smile. Seated Swiftly, greeted again by another team member. Drink order was taken immediately. Greeted again by another amazing staff member.

The menu is just right! 
I ordered The Mama's French toast with scrambled eggs and cheese with bacon and a side of grits. (Wait until I tell you about these grits)

The French toast you can taste the cinnamon sprinkled on top... Fluffy. Mmmmmmmm
Not a fan of eggs, however they were also fluffy and tasty with the perfect amount of cheese.

NOW THESE GRITS!
My Mama (get it) lol. In my opinion makes the best grits to man kind. She's in NYC. Second from her grit is Mike from The Home of Chicken and Waffles in the Bay area. Now Mr.Mamas is added to the list. I love my grits with a little lump and airy. Mr.Mamas grits is life.

My Husband ordered Mr.Mamas pancakes.
The pancakes was the size of your head. For the first time in history my husband was not able to finish his food. I was so happy that he met his match.

The pancakes by the way fluffy and the syrup soaks into the pancake....so tasty.

Looking around the the restaurant, everything is so clean, organized in place the equipment look brand new out the box but it's not. I was in HEAVEN! For me to be such a foodie and dine out a lot I never truly feel comfortable and safe eating food from others maybe it's the inspector in me 

Oh yeah! A really awesome employee took a really great picture of us at the table with our food from a great angle...thanks buddy

Our server Eileen, sweet as pie, very nice not over baring....just perfect

I also noticed that all the staff is happy with each other, helpful like a team and having a good time being at work. Great Atmosphere

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr.MAMA. GREAT GUY. FEELS LIKE THAT FAVORITE UNCLE WHO YOU CALL TO GET YIU OUT OF TROUBLE WITH OUT JUDGING YOU BUT WILL GIVE YOU A STERN LECTURE AND HUG YOU AFTER.

Maria the Manager. (Bad with names) so nice, with a great smile.. God Bless you!

At the end of my experience. I felt I was leaving really close family members and I don't want to go.
I was left wondering how can I franchise and put this restaurant next door to my house.

MR.MAMAS IS DEFINITELY 5 STAR ALL THE WAY!

I ALMOST FORGOT! HOW CLEAN TO CONDIMENT BOTTLES ARE! IM A STICKLER FOR BOTTLES THAT HAVE GUNK ON THEM. THESE BOTTLES WERE SPARKLING CLEAN AND I LOVE THAT THEY OFFER DELI MUSTARD, IT'S MY FAVORITE. (NO I didn't need it for my meal, but I did taste it just because)"}
{"text":"Wow the food was good (not the best I have ever had) but the service !!! Everyone talked with you and welcomed you! I was very impressed !"}
{"text":"Came because it got great reviews, but was disappointed again by Yelpers who rated it 4 stars. The service was good and the place was clean. I ordered French toast with fresh starberries, sausage and eggs. The strawberries weren't sweet and the French toast was lacking something (the edges were a little hard and the center seemed flat instead of fluffy). My husband had the steak and eggs. He said the steak was just OK and you can tell it was recently defrosted. We were expecting something really good but got mediocre."}
{"text":"Great place outside of strip and prices are great. Family fun and good food. We loved our breakfast, the french toast my daughter ate it all   my hash browns perfect crisp as I requested.  My son loved his  pancakes, eggs and bacon. Every time we visit Vegas this will be our breakfast go to. Hop right in lyft and head to Mr. Mamas  we all ate and had drinks under $40."}
{"text":"Was hoping this was a drag queen cafe, but sadly it wasn't. BUT, the food was delicious....a little off the strip, but worth the drive! Prices were fair and the food was plentiful. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best service i have experienced in a long time. Very quick with a high quality meal.  I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We returned to Mr. Mamas for an early work lunch yesterday.  I say returned because the first time we visited a couple weeks ago the wait was too long for us to give it a go.  Anyway, our party had a breakfast burrito, 2 hamburgers and a chicken fried steak.  The comments on the food was the chicken fried steak was good and everything else was okay.  The owner meets and greets most and has to go home tired as I am not sure he stopped talking the whole time we were there.  The ambiance of the diner is non descript as all tables are in open space and I don't know what the lighthouse and other pictures have to do with restaurant name or logo or if it they are just simply unrelated. It seems like they do a good amount of business with regulars and church groups but our group will continue to try other places for lunch."}
{"text":"I have only given a few five stars, ever, and this small, off the strip restaurant is great.  First, be prepared for the owner to meet you at the door and welcome you, get you seated, and share a story or two if you are interested.  While in Vegas for three days I had breakfast here twice and both times the quality of service and food was excellent.  This is excellent prepared home cooking, in a clean well managed restaurant.  Generous portions, fast and friendly service and it seemed like everyone working there was upbeat, friendly and efficient.  The prices I felt were reasonable based on the quality and quantity of the food.  If you want to experience some local (outside the casino) good food in a great atmosphere go have breakfast at Mr Mamas, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best mom and pops quiet lil breakfast place in Vegas.
I go there 0nce a week with my wife and daughter, everytime we go there they make us feel like we are at a family members house.
I recommend this place to anyone, young, old, big or small.
These people will fulfill all your hunger needs.
I have been trying to find one bad thing with this place but I shooting blanks."}
{"text":"It just wasn't all that.  They are nice enough people but the food was just uninspired.  

The burger patty itself was quite tasty but the rest of the accompaniments were just meh.   The fries were boring not not crispy.  The restaurant is just one big open room with tables scattered about with a over abundance of ceiling fans.   The fans make me think more about how much stuff they were blowing into my food than cooling effect.   

Just not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Consistently the best breakfast spot in town.  The owners will make you feel like family, the staff clearly take great pride in their food and service, and now they have an even bigger location so the wait times aren't quite so crazy.  You'll love it, I promise!"}
{"text":"I visited Mr. Mama's after it was recommended by a colleague and I am so glad we decided to dine there. Upon arrival, there was about a 45 minute wait but it was well worth it. The restaurant definitely gives you \"mom and pop\" vibes but that's what I loved most...you felt like you were right at home. It's about a 5 minute drive from the Palms so you'd definitely need to Uber or Cab it. I had the blackened steak and eggs and it was delicious. Oh, and the service was great too!"}
{"text":"every time I visit Las Vegas, every time I try this place. The breakfast is awesome! The owner is friendly and introduced the history of the restaurant. My parents enjoyed the breakfast soooooooo much!"}
{"text":"Been on the bookmark for months. Finally tried it and not disappointed. 

I had steak and eggs and the niece had the vegetarian omelet. I would choose the hash browns over the home fries. It was the best we ever had. Make sure to have them extra crispy. 

Also the orange juice is the best ever too. Just the right amount of pulp and sweetness. They have a to of other things I want to try. 

The owner also personally greeted, sat , and bussed as much as he could. Great experience will come back"}
{"text":"This new location is bigger than the old one, but the excellent customer service and good food are the same.
-Mr. Mama is there to greet you when you walk in the door and seats you.
-The staff takes your order quickly and doesn't blink an eye when you ask to substitute fruit instead of the hash browns that come with your veggie omelet and then change your mind and ask for avocado instead of the fruit. Oh, and egg whites for that omelet are no problema (extra charge, of course.)
-Refills are forthcoming on a regular basis so you can stay hydrated throughout your meal.
-You get a free beverage with your Yelp check-in.
-The food is good and won't break the bank.
-Did I mention customer service is a plus?  Mr. Mama comes by to check on you as well as the staff, ever so friendly.
Haven't been here for lunch yet, but this is definitely recommended if you're a breakfast/brunch food lover."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service! We got very lucky and only had to wait about 10 mins to get a table (expect a wait). Mr Manas himself was walking around, thanking diners, and asking if there is anything they could do better....a true sign of hospitality! I highly recommend Mr. Mamas and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best service in Las Vegas. Food is pretty good for a diner. Price is excellent. Overall value exceptional."}
{"text":"Very nice \"homey\" feeling when walking in. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Portions of the food were a good size but not too overwhelming. I ordered the eggs Benedict with choice of meat, I chose sausage. Also I ordered a half order of sausage and gravy. My girlfriend ordered the Cali omelette and cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was probably one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. The eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce as well. Cali omelette was good but not great. I was a bit disappointed in the sausage and gravy. Sausage and gravy is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch dishes. The portion was good but to me the gravy lacked a bit in flavor. I gave a 3 in cleanliness just because I'm not a fan of employees eating when guests are around. Would come back though.

Service - 5
Ambiance - 5

{"text":"The BEST breakfast food that I've ever had.

I don't remember where I got wind of this place but it was in my bookmarks and I suggested it the crew on our way out of Vegas.

It has a mom & pops feel but you can tell they pay extra attention to the small details.  A host opened the door for us as we walked in and immediately sat us down.  We ordered a cinnamon roll, a pair of chicken fried steaks, an omelette (I forget which), and a biscuits and gravy meal.

They started us off with the cinnamon roll which you could tell was definitely not store bought.  In my opinion, almost all cinnamon rolls out there are all icing and some bread.  This was was made with the correct amount of cinnamon and not completely drenched in icing.  It actually tasted like a pastry, not a dessert.

Their gravy is made with sausage, bacon, and a touch of maple syrup.  It was not runny in any way, shape or form; to the point where you could spoon it on with a fork.  By far the best breakfast gravy I've ever had.  The subtle sweetness of the gravy complemented and cut through the saltiness of the chicken fried steak.  It tones down the saltiness of the gravy itself making it that much more enjoyable.

The friend that got the omelette was surprised by the amount of veggies/stuffing she had in it.  From the picture, you can see that veggies were coming out through the egg.  She said it was so satisfying that it wasn't just a few springs of spinach with 4 eggs.

Also note our \"extra crispy\" hashbrowns.  Whenever I order them that way elsewhere, they're always soggy in the middle.  Most establishments make your hashbrowns too thick so there's too much filler in between the crispy parts.  Not here.  The hashbrowns are spread thin enough to give you a big satisfying crunch instead of just mushy potatoes.

As we were driving out here, we were wondering where the hell we were going and if it was worth ever coming here again as it is a bit out of the way, but all of us agreed that it was and is definitely worth driving 15 minutes out of the way to visit this place on the way out of Vegas.  We plan on trying the lunch menu next time.

See ya soon Mr. Mama!"}
{"text":"From the SERVICE, to the FOOD

Everything was phenomenal!

THE STAFF WAS SO AWESOME!!

They worked as a team and again the food was excellent.

We definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Took a drive out of the strip to check this place out. Turns out it was really good! The pico de gallo took the Cali omelette over the top w/some crispy hash browns on the side, yummy! Under $30 for the hubby and I, it was a great deal and awesome for the amount and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Thanks fellow yelpers for the great reviews. We were not disappointed!  The breakfast portions are huge; speaking of huge, those pancakes are humongous and delicious. Some of the best coffee ever. Even on a busy Saturday, the customer service made you feel like family. You must go!"}
{"text":"First time at Mr. Mamas. We had a great experience. We were greeted by all the staff, we even got to speak with Mr. Mama himself. We ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs with home fries. I also had to get a cinnamon roll :)
The steak was great. Perfect amount of batter. The gravy was a little different from what we've had before but it was definitely tasty! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and awesome owner! Will be hitting this joint again next time we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is literally down the street from my house and I'm a little mad at myself for not trying it earlier! 

+ Service was amazing. Friendly (but not overly so) employees from start to finish. They were fun to talk to and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. 

+ Best hash browns I've ever had in my life. They look so normal and unassuming but once you take a bite, it's like a little piece of crispy potato heaven.

+ Great prices for what you get.

+ You can substitute toast for 1 pancake at no extra charge! The pancake is also delicious and pretty large as well. I couldn't finish mine.

+ As long as you walk in the door before closing (2pm on weekdays, 3pm on weekends), they will seat and serve you!

- The steak was too salty. It was tender though, so maybe it was just seasoned with a heavy-handed chef this time. 

- I called ahead of time to make sure we were ok to come in pretty close to closing time. Whoever answered the phone did not sound friendly but maybe that's just me.

So far, I've only had the Cali omelet, steak and eggs, and pancakes, all of which were bomb. Even the coffee is pretty tasty for a drip variety! It's always good to leave a restaurant feeling jubilant thanks to delicious food and impeccable service. It was so good that the small negative notes don't even matter to me. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"You really can not go wrong here.  Have been here a couple times when we have been in the area.  First time no wait for a table, but the second time it was about 20 minutes.  They have nearly any breakfast or lunch item that you can imagine and happily made a requested dish for me.
Food is quite good and yes the prices may be a tad higher than a few places that are just as good but it is the servers and the homey atmosphere that make this place stand out, and I would put service over $$ anytime.
They can always count on a visit from us when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Simply said, Mr Mamas is better than ever. They know how to deliver  meals fast for the masses in line here and the quality of their food remains great. We've been here for breakfast with our favorites being ham steak and eggs with sourdough toast (buttered for us!!) , steak and eggs plus the mr mamas combo of huge pancakes and eggs/bacon. They even take pics for you here too! Bravo to Julie and the Mr Mamas staff!"}
{"text":"My husband found this place through Yelp.  We got there around 10:30 and still waited 30 minutes to get seated.  While waiting, the guy came out and shouted customer names so loud that I think scared a few people away.  Food was definitely excellent, coffee came with my favorite French Vanilla creamer.  Portion was decent.  However, when we got our bill, everything was more than the menu price.  For example, we ordered large chili bowl.   The waitress asked if we wanted cheese or onions.  My husband didn't want them but I said to have them on the side so I can have some.  It was his order.  They charged us 75 cents for this.  If we knew this is extra charge, we would've said no.  We ordered 4 dishes and every plates were charged extra for something.  The waitress didn't explain all the extra charge once.  We still left 20% tip.  The extra charge wasn't the issue just felt the restaurant nickle and dime us.  Anyway, we will definitely go back but we know how to order next time."}
{"text":"We were hopeful that with all the amazing reviews this place was going to finally be a great las vegas food experience.

Sadly though, as has become the trend, the food here was pretty mediocre.  Certainly not the worst food ive ever had, but it's not the life changing expirencing most people seem to be having.

The biscuits and gravey tasted like they were comprised of 2% milk, flour, and jimmy dean bacon sausage, with a dusting of black pepper and no salt for miles.

My friend had the chilli cheese fries, and commented that it tasted like Ragu from a can with ground beef.  No traditional seasoning and it was \"from a jar\" bright red.

Setting aside the food, the space is arranged nicely.  Tables are positioned in such a way as make it feel like youve got a nice amount of room to enjoy your meal.

The service was fast and attentive, which is a nice change from the usual off strip dining expirences we've had this far.

All in all, sadly just not worth getting out of bed for."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, huge portions, very reasonable.  Laid back atmosphere,  if you have not been your missing out."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with awesome family atmosphere ! I came in 30 minutes before closing and didn't realize this until I looked at their closing time on google. They greeted me with a beautiful vibe. Mr mamas even greeted us and made sure we were happy and satisfied with our meals. The staff treat each other like family and I admire how nice and helpful they are to each other, which makes for the perfect family atmosphere. On top of that, the food is absolutely delicious and prices are normal, not jacked up 300% Vegas prices. Start your day here!
Thanks again for the Birthday Cinnamon Bun! Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good breakfast spot in Vegas for a while and this place does it. Price, quality, quantity, and service, I haven't seen better in Vegas. 5 stars for me is a place where I will definitely go back, recommend to others, and a place I take visiting friends and family.....this place is all of that. 

Chicken fried steak with sausage gravy should come with sausage, and it's the only spot so far that actually has a lot of sausage in the gravy. Service was great and felt like a family spot, if there's a better place than this, I haven't found it. Price was perfect, and I felt like I definitely got my money's worth."}
{"text":"We arrived fairly early on a Sunday morning and the place wasn't quite full, and were seated immediately. Service was fast & friendly, the food was awesome - I had a fantastic omelet. My pals all enjoyed their meals too. As we were leaving, the rush hour had begun - there was a metric buttload of people waiting outside. Not surprised - this place is great and we'll definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas is an excellent place for breakfast and lunch!  You can't miss the sign driving by as it stands out from the other businesses in the plaza.  I've tried the gravy, which is their specialty and I must say it is delicious.  I would like to try to chicken fried steak with gravy and eggs next time I visit Mr Mamas, it looks amazing.  On my last visit I had Mr Mamas French toast which included two large pieces of French toast cut in half accompanied by eggs and three crispy pieces of bacon which you can substitute with ham or sausage.  Excellent portion of food for the pricing and I almost finished the entire meal except for a quarter slice of French toast.  The French toast is not as battery as some places I've had but is very tasty with hints of cinnamon powder.  The atmosphere is a bit noisy as it's one large room of tables kind of close to each other but the food and service distract you from the rowdiness.  Top choice in Vegas for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Great brunch!!! Lots of fun and delicious food... Waffles on Fleek. They have a great staff. They made our Vegas breakfast experience wonderful."}
{"text":"I've never been to a more heart warming place! The service always wins my heart over & the food always wins my tummy over. LOL."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things!!! Chicken fried steak was heaven sent, chili cheese omelette was amazing as well"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional service. One of my friends had a food allergic to a certain food item. We specifically asked that the particular item be removed. They didn't remove it and my friend ended up with a rash. The manager came over to hear us but all we got was a fake apology. 99% of the restaurants would have done more. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"People here are very sweet. Food was excellent. Coffee was good too which was not expected for a little strip mall diner like this."}
{"text":"I must imply that customer service here is genuinely great. Service was quick. French toast was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best service I got at a breakfast place! People are super friendly. 

I wanted to come here for a couple of things. One is the cinnamon bun and two is for their biscuits and gravy. 

Cinnamon bun came out first and it was nice and fresh from the oven. It was cover in sugary glaze sauce. YUM. I was only able to eat two or three bites and couldn't eat anymore. It was way too sweet but good. 

Next, I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns. The biscuits were delicious. It was warm and toasty and the gravy wasn't too bad either. The biscuits are cooked in-house and you can taste the difference from the store bought ones. The hash browns are the best here. Nice and crispy in every bite. Love it. 

It was a little bit off the strip but I would come back again. However, you must come early this place gets pack real fast."}
{"text":"Service is incredibly good and the personnel attention to everyone in my Peru was exceptional. 
Food quality was rally good."}
{"text":"Wonderful owner and staff, very warm and welcoming. Food was amazing and made from scratch. You can tell the family takes pride in their restaurant. Lots of food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I was blown away by this great restaurant! After eating bad, overpriced food, in Vegas this was like walking into Moms kitchen. I was seated right away but it was on a Tues mid morning. I ordered the chicken fried steak and my waitress took the time to explain the gravy in case I wouldn't like it. Not like it? I loved it. I want to marry it! It was that good. The portion was huge (sorry no picture, I gobbled it up) and every bite had me going yum. The manager, Kat, was going table to table engaging guests and making sure everything was alright. They even brought me flavored coffee creamers without me asking. Who does that? Go see them, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Came for breakfast and the service was really good. I'm assuming it was the owner who greeted us and waved us off when we left, super friendly dude. The staff (from servers to busser) was very friendly and helpful. Food was great (although mine was a BIT salty. My husband didn't have the same problem) and they had good portions at an excellent price. We'll definitely be back next time we're in town. They were very accommodating when we came in later than our group and set us up right away. It was a plus that they even set up a chair for my car seat without even asking! Very thoughtful. We always have to be after people to set something up. I think the friendly service is what made this place for me!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  We accidentally went to the old location on Decatur but quickly found the right one.  All the staff was so darn friendly.  I had the cinnamon bun and biscuits & gravy.  The gravy was good...but kinda weird...the sausage was pink!  It was cooked but it was pink.  Husband got Jenna's wrap and really liked it.  I think the manager came over and asked us how our meal was.  So friendly and food was good...not too expensive.  I'd go back here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat breakfast, everyone is super nice, the food is delicious,and the portions are good definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I had a delicious breakfast here. Denver omelette & chili cheese omelette had great flavor! Pancakes & French-toast on point. We will def be back! It's one of the best breakfast spots I found in all of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant 11:20 AM, for seated around 11:50 Am. Placed our orders 11:55 AM. Now, it's 12:54 PM, STILL WAITING!!! Their excuse: too many to go orders... Can you believe that?"}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere, loved the place first time we've been there and I loved what the menu said about leaving a smile in my face. I would said not just a smile but also a great memory of this place. Right from the beginning the host was amazing, he waited on us took our names remembered my name  she called me and the staff was just crazy friendly. Plus one of the staff members took this picture posted on the site. Awesome will definitely come back to Mr. Mamas."}
{"text":"Great place very busy will be back all the stuff we ordered was made fresh. I like that they use ordering at the table but they could use Nowait to Managment the wait list"}
{"text":"Best. Omelet. Ever. Not an exaggeration. I'm picky about omelets, too: most places overcook them. But Mr Mamas does it just right, so the eggs stay light and fluffy. 

They also take their customer service seriously--all the employees I saw were professional and attentive.

I almost docked them a star because a two person table sat empty for about ten minutes before they seated me at it. Not sure why. But that is a hiccup and the overall experience was greqt."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! We used to love stacks and yolks but wanted to try something new. You muuuust get the cinnamon roll - so yum! My husband loved the pancakes and I got an omelet. They are very kid friendly. All the employees were nice and attentive. The owner is very friendly too! Will definitely be back, over and over!"}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that I was incredibly hungover and starving, so that may bias me. But this breakfast burrito that I ordered was ABSOLUTELY delicious."}
{"text":"On our home from Vegas....stopped for a quick bite! Pancakes were delicious....but what stood out the most was the service! Everybody was wonderful! Very friendly and attentive! The hostest with the mostest Roe was amazing! Will definitely stop by again when we are here! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Taco salad without shredded beef. Unfortunately to my disappointment I was not satisfied. I was really looking forward to this taco salad that included black and red beans. I only received the red beans & only about 1/4 of a cup. Since I didn't order shredded beef I expected a larger serving of beans. On a good note...they did have great ice tea. However, I most likely won't come back for their taco salad. I'm unsure of anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Mr. Mamas is the all american breakfast restaurant. That solid breakfast that you can go enjoy with your family before the start of a big soccer tournament or with your buddies after a night of smash mouth karaoke.

You initially get thrown off by the limo tint windows that may make you feel like you're walking into a secret sex shop but do not be deceived as Mr. Mama himself is likely to open the door for you

Inviting service, during your visit the owners will prove to you that they care about the quality of their business. Our waitress was very nice and you can tell that they only hire people that enjoy their job and carry around a positive attitude. (+)

The menu is quite provincial. In an area with so many glittery things it's refreshing to see 1+1=2. 

California Omelette: I came here on my morning of departure, so what better way to transition from state to state than by ordering this? Large portion 4 egg omelette. The ingredients were fresh, the hash browns were thinned out enough for it to not feel like finishing them was homework. 4/5

French Toast: Normal french toast. No special bread or an over glamorized batter, but once again it was good enough to where that's all you needed. 3.5/5

Mr. Mamas is like a gateway computer, a super nintendo, a motorola flip phone...it's fulfills the basic needs. When you don't want the serendipity's of the world and want pancakes and eggs, they will be here for you."}
{"text":"I came here, what, 3-4 months ago?  Just writing the review now... When my sister & her BF were in town the family decided to come here upon my brother's suggestion.  Place was full but we were able to get a seat pretty quickly, as it appears they turn the tables around pretty quickly.  There's really nothing to this place from décor standpoint, in fact purely from the looks of the interior it's tough to expect a lot out of it.

Six of us sat and ordered a variety of stuff.  I would say from food standpoint it was as good as any excellent breakfast joints.  Service was great with staff that seems to enjoy working there, including the very enthusiastic owner who ups the mood of the whole diner with his running around and conversations.  It's really the highlight of this place.

With prices also being reasonable, I would come here again if I happen to be in the area or if I'm heading out for breakfast with mum & bro, since it's near their place.  And therein lies my 4-star rating, instead of 5.  If I'm in the mood to go out for breakfast, am I thinking immediately, \"I want to drive 20 minutes to go to Mr. Mamas\"?  Well, no.  I guess that's why it's a 4 - good food, great service, fine atmosphere, but what's that above-and-beyond that makes me want to go out of my way to come back?  Still, a fine breakfast establishment.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Question isn't whether it's appropriate, it's whether they have seats."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes because people know the food is that good and worth the wait. Had Cali omelette was delicious. Friends had chicken fried steak and it was hearty and delicious. Biscuit and gravy was amazing. The gravy is home made with bacon, maple syrup and sausage. Can't go wrong with that combo. Service was great and even made the hash browns extra crispy as requested. All bottle of condiments were full and sitting on table. Heard French toast was good too so that will have to wait until the next visit."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat a great breakfast for a great price. It's not on the strip but worth the drive. I will be back."}
{"text":"...excellent breakfast place...the food was great and so was the service....ill definitely be a regular customer from now on....thanks yelp for the coupon as well."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is some of the friendliest staff I've ever encountered at a breakfast place! You are welcomed with someone opening the door for you and walking you to your seat. Our server Melissa S. was great. The food was great breakfast food as well; the bacon was actually bacon, not like one of those chain restaurants. Two pancakes, eggs, and bacon filled me up to the point I was barely able to finish because the pancakes were huge and cooked perfectly. I would recommend this place to everyone, politeness is hard to come by in most places, but this place is overflowing with it. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"5 star rated for good reason! Great food, my steak and eggs were delicious. The steak was grilled nicely and just how I ordered it. The wife had French toast and gave it a solid review. Good atmosphere, competent and friendly staff, and FAST service! What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I know I have probably left reviews about mr. Mama's restaurant before but every time I come here my experience is amazing I have visited a lot of other breakfast restaurants in Las Vegas and the cleanliness and wonderful service that I receive it Mr mama's always blows the others away whatever they do hear it mr. Mama's the whole staff is on board and they all do it right they make my day"}
{"text":"I love it. The staff is always super nice and the food is amazing. It's walking distance from my house which is amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a great meal at amazing prices."}
{"text":"the only thing better than the food here is the service. everything was amazing, the food was excellent (I had mama's chicken fried steak), and the entire staff was so warm and welcoming. I will definitely be back again and I'll be telling all my friends to stop through!"}
{"text":"Cheap, cheerful and so satisfying.  We had a short wait for morning rush.  The food was great, the guy who mans the door was a talented conductor of a living orchestra of patrons, staff, the wait list and maybe even the kitchen - a maestro.

We enjoyed pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs...all my breakfast needs were met.  Not fancy, and just what I needed."}
{"text":"At home atmosphere with very pleasant tentative staff. Good food. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"OMG this is the best breakfast joint in Vegas! We saw reviews on Yelp and decided to try it - One of the best decisions we've made this trip. We traveled with our kids and wanted a reasonably priced, family friendly place. The wait was 45 minutes but it was totally worth it! The place was packed with a steady stream of people and for good reason. We had eggs Benedict, Denver omelette, breakfast burrito and a tuna melt. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS and the portions were very filling. To top it all off, the service was great and the staff was very friendly. Do yourself a favor, get off the strip and go eat here!"}
{"text":"Too excited for my food to get here to get too detailed, but this has to be the best place in town (even though we're visiting from Phoenix). Last time we were here we were trying to figure out how to get a Mr Mamas in Scottsdale as it's better than ANYWHERE back home by a long shot!!!"}
{"text":"Another amazing find they split or order onto two plates no extra charge and the breakfast wrap and hasbrowns were extremely tasty. I would highly recommend this local eatery."}
{"text":"Food is great with a variety of breakfast & lunch items on the menu.  Get the pancakes - 1 or more.  The staff members are also wonderful.  I cannot say enough about the great service my family received from Rose.  I hope I got her name right.  We had a bunch of questions & Rose was spot on with her descriptions & recommendations.  Bless her heart.  Now to finish this post off with another note.  Great job Ms. Manager for coming around to speak with the patrons personally.  Fantastic job everyone!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. Service was very good. Manager was on top of everything, owner is lucky to have her running the team. Food was hot, very tasty, and very fast service. A must stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was really solid. The service was exceptional. There was no wait, at least 3 employees welcomed us, and our order was taken quickly. We had French toast, breakfast sandwich, abc omelette and eggs florentine. We would definitely come back. Prices were reasonable. It felt like the employees were all working as a team and were invested in creating a quality experience for their costumers."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus star I would; bad service and bad food these people know nothing about the restaurant business.  Just saying!"}
{"text":"Breakfast: terrific food, great customer service and excellent coffee.  Love the biscuits, too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Service was wonderful. Staff was so friendly. Owner offered to take pictures without us having to ask. Checked on us multiple times. Pancakes were so fluffy it was like eating cake. Definitely a favorite brunch place while visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and restroom (very important to me). The hub said it was the best omelette (Cali) he'd ever eaten! Pancakes were light and fluffy, just what I hankering for, especially went well with the fruit cup.

Owner and servers so friendly and accommodating.Worth leaving the Cosmopolitan hotel for this breakfast off the strip."}
{"text":"My dad and I were leaving Vegas to drive back to Orange County California and we decided to get breakfast, I found this place and I am so glad that I did. We got there and we were seated almost immediately. The server paid a lot of attention to us which was great, our food was amazing, the environment was great. I'm really happy we went to a local place for breakfast rather than a Denny's or an ihop! Thank you guys for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"Been to Las Vegas around February for the last 4 years  and only now I've found the perfect breakfast... the bacon is crispy on the outside and soft inside!!!  Best bacon ever! And the pancakes were just perfect. The service was very good and you can feel they are being honest when the say 'Have a good day!'. Mr Mamas, I wish I had known you before..."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Owner is super friendly and our server Melissa was so attentive! Food is delicious. Everything cooked perfectly and well seasoned. Will definitely come back with the rest of the family."}
{"text":"When I land in Vegas in the morning. This is where I go first before checking into my hotel. Best breakfast in town"}
{"text":"Very friendly service.... Owner very professional ... the breakfast is delicious ...I'm from California and I was very welcome here again..."}
{"text":"Stopped here this morning before heading home. 
I was not aware they had moved. They used to be located on Decatur. But is now located on Jones. 
The new location is more roomy. It had been a few years since I've eaten here. I'm not surprised they had to move to a offer location. Bcz this place was amazing the last time I was here. 
The new location is really nice and as you might expect with something this good. There was a little bit of a wait. But it's well worth it. 
The place is clean and the menu is excellent! 
The coffee isn't the usual crappy coffee like you get elsewhere. It's really good. 
We came here this morning to eat with my brother before heading home. He had not heard of this place. 
The menu is a little overwhelming. The choices are great. My brother had corned beef hash. Mom had the wife had the standard eggs and bacon or sausage. Me???? I like to tryn people's chicken fried steak. Bcz it's always different everywhere you eat. 
These guy get down. The gravy is honest to God sausage gravy. The steak didn't seem to be some frozen patty with gravy to hide the lack of quality. 
The eggs were real eggs. Toast was buttery. I like my hash browns crispy. I got crispy. One of the guys even took a group picture of us. I think he may be he owner. Bcz I believe I seen him at the old location. This is one of those places when I come to Vegas that is going to be one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"I would have rated this higher had I not been seated next to the coffee and tea station.  Parked right next to it was the table washing cart.  I watched over and over as busers wrung out wet table rags, squirting dirty water next to an open pitcher of tea that waitresses used to refill drinks. 

Prices were comparable to similar diner type restaurants.  Food was ok, but pancakes are better at IHOP, Denny's, and Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Breakfast was deliciously good. Omg them home fries with bell peppers and onion were fantastic, crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The staff was wonderful too, will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"During our America the Beautiful tour in June 2017, we covered 11 states in 11 days.  In every new city we used Yelp (and sometimes Google Maps) to find locally-owned burger joints and diners.  During our June 2018 America the Beautiful we'll only get to five states.  But again we use Yelp as a guide.  We search for the best burgers or BLTs.  On June 10, 2018, Yelp led us to try Mr. Mamas for breakfast.  We could not have been happier!  From the greeter opening the door, continuing to the owner and manager, then our extraordinary server Claudia and continuing through the sincere staff thanks as we departed, the entire team was friendly and attentive.  I had the Eggs Benedict on Daly's Applewood Thick Cut Smoked Bacon.  My husband Dave had the BLT, also with Applewood Smoked Bacon.  The food was excellent, and delivered warm and promptly."}
{"text":"This place is at a new location now but is just as great as before but with more seating! The owner (Nick) is a great guy and you'll probably see him making his rounds talking to customers and making you feel right at home. 

If you need a meal recommendation try the chicken fried steak and eggs - the gravy is different than anywhere I have ever had and is to die for!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and although it was very busy, we received our food fast! The cinnamon roll was really good. Mr. Mama himself came and checked to see how things were. He is very personable and wants to make sure that top notch service is provided. A++++"}
{"text":"Great customer service and outstanding breakfast food. Simple off the beaten path place that obviously has a great following with the locals. Short stack pancakes were excellent and my coffee cup never emptied. Good prices. I'd come again"}
{"text":"THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I HAVE EVER HAD! Wonderful staff and the kindest waiters/waitress. Food is delicious and within anyone's budget. You will enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"The servers were really nice but the food is average for the long wait. I am willing to wait for amazing food, which is what I was expecting, but honestly the food was not great."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by chance when the other restaurant we were planning to visit had too long of a wait time.  Good luck for us!  The establishment is very clean and staff are very friendly and attentive.  We did not have to wait for a table but the patrons that came later had about a 10 minute wait.  The home fries seemed to be a yelp favorite so I had to try them for myself.  I had the steak and eggs with home fries.   I am pleased to say that everything was worth the hype.  The steak was a rib eye cut and very tender and flavorful.  The prices are awesome.  So worth the drive across town.  A great place!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best breakfast place in town! I ordered the biscuits and gravy;  was a bit concerned since they told me that they use maple syrup in the gravy. But ohhhhhhh, that first bite was awesome. Probably the best biscuits and gravy I have never had -- almost better than my Uncle Wayne's from Tennessee."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for breakfast , the people are all nice and friendly. The food excellent and huge servings"}
{"text":"Great food. Even better dining in experience, very family oriented and also great service. The owner came and personally welcomed us and shared stories and made small talk for several minutes. Incredibly friendly, warm, and welcoming. This place is one of a kind, and a must-visit for any Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Came in with my husband for lunch and impressed by the speed, never had to ask for a rush on anything and the selections were good and more importantly tasted great! Pleasantly surprised by the ability to give our CC to our server at the table and it never left our sight so there's no issues with fraud which after having CC info stolen at restaurants in the past a huge perk! Fast friendly service, great food and atmosphere reminded me of when we used to hit up local diners in NYC, so kind of homey for us in a transplant kind of way. Also, fruit was super fresh and not weird tasting like it had been sitting or sprayed with anything. Will be back here before/after appts and in the future for lunch with hubs when we have the chance now and then."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite breakfast food place I've ever been to in my life(?). The wait wasn't too bad/staff was really great communicating about the wait status. 
The pancakes are so thick and I got a cinnamon roll and it was also probably the most beautiful and good cinnamon roll of my life also."}
{"text":"WOW.

Post workout vibes with all the carbs. Rolled in and didn't have to wait long on a Saturday morning around 8:15am. The restaurant was packed but we were the first on the waitlist and the hostess was so kind. We initially were a party of four but a friend decided to join last minute and although we added a bit more time to our wait, we were assured that it wouldn't be an issue and we were sat in about fifteen minutes.

The menu has a little bit of everything. I was pulled towards the burrito but the corned beef hash is what won me over. It's not shredded corned beef, which is my favorite, but the hash was crumbled and packed with salty and rich flavor. The hashbrowns were wildly crispy and my over medium eggs were yolky and divine. I opted for their swirled rye and made perfect bites on the buttery toast. My table shared two of their cinnamon rolls and OH. MY. GOD. They were gooey and rich, covered in frosting with every bite. 

There was a gentleman walking around and he offered to take a photo of our group saying, \"You need a family photo.\" He stood up on a chair in a busy restaurant to take several photos of us on my phone. He worked there and was just doing a nice thing. It caught me by surprise and was definitely appreciated. 

Oh, and the coffee was good. A lot of breakfast spots overlook their roasted bean treat but Mr Mamas did it right. Really looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"A beautiful little restaurant with an interesting history behind it.

My waitress Denise was very nice and gave me a little story behind Mr. Mamas. It is Greek as well as its owner and the owner before. 

I got their famous chicken fried steak with a side of onion and peppers. This is AWESOME! Denise gave me a sample of their gravy and it is to die for.

Free wifi, very clean, and the decor does look Greek. I thought it looked familiar. Fabulous place! I would like to come here everyday. 

Oh and one of the hostess held the door open for me which was nice!

Awesome place for excellent service and food. 

Please support this place!  
No I'm not endorsed or paid to say that LOL"}
{"text":"The reviews were on point about customer service. Opened the door and welcomed us upon arrival. Mr. Mama was super friendly. Even offered to call a taxi for us after we finished up. 
Excellent food, big potions. Defiantly a top place to eat breakfast at. We got here around 6:30am and no crowds then."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at this location. The service was great. Shawn was great and made us feel warm and welcomed. He took care of us from the time we sat down until the time we left. The food was an excellent mix of homemade flavors. I highly recommend this location for breakfast anytime you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We always go for our regular which is the country fried steak with their homemade gravy. The Breakfast burrito was pretty good too. Although I do have to agree with some other reviewers, sometimes their food could use a touch of salt. I've had the steak & eggs which was just ok. But if you stick with the country fried steak, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious.  Veggie omelette with toast and hash browns.  Omelette was really big.  Food was cooked quickly and served immediately.  Hot and tasty.  Only downside everyone wants in.  We were told it would be about 40 mins instead we waited for an hour.   It is a Saturday, and like I said, everyone wants in"}
{"text":"Yelp was wrong on this one. Everyone else seems to really like this place but it didn't live up to its rating. 
Pros: good orange juice and best hash browns I've ever had. Very friendly service. 
Cons: pancakes tastes like Denny's and sausage is identical to McDonald's. The home fries were very strange.... Huge slices of fried potato and we ask for bell peppers and onions with it and they just dump it on top? No cooking it with it for flavor? 

I'd skip this place if I were you."}
{"text":"My toast showed up burnt, my steak that I ordered with my steak and eggs showed up well done when I ordered it medium rare.  I understand that it's tough for a short order cook to cook a perfect medium rare but this had exactly zero pink in it.  The home fries tasted like they came out of a bag.  Bummer.  

The good is that the owner introduced himself when we entered and was very friendly.  Our waitress was very nice too.  My eggs were cooked properly which can be tough when you order over medium. 

Problem is, I care way more about the quality of the food than the niceness of my waitress, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Looking for a good, cheap breakfast joint with great customer service? Bookmark Mr. Mamas. I hopped off the plane looking for a good breakfast spot. The Yelp reviews averaged 4.5 stars so I gave it a try and Yelpers didn't steer me wrong.

Customer service was above par from the get go. As we were walking up to the door, the host (and I think manager) opened the door for us and gave us a warm greeting. He told us to sit wherever we wanted. It didn't take long for someone to come over with water and offer any check to see if we wanted any other drinks. We also didn't wait very long for our food to be served to us. 

In all honesty, the food wasn't spectacular. The pancakes, although they were generously sized, were kind of dry so I had to drench them in syrup. The eggs and everything else were standard but what I think made the experience so great was the fantastic customer service. Not bad Mr. Mamas, not bad."}
{"text":"Walked in,  immediately  greeted by whom I can only assume was the owner.  Told there was a 10-15 minute wait and were seated in almost 15 min.  Our order was taken quickly and came out maybe 15 minutes later.  Although the cook was a little unprofessional with his yelling profanities about being slammed in the kitchen, he calmed down and our breakfast was fantastic.  It held us over all day, so much food we couldn't finish our plates.  Great price and service ultimately.  Our beverages were always kept full and hot and a good meal.  We are from out of town but will definitely make this a must have when we visit.  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The staffs and the owner are very friendly, the owner even open the door for guests coming in or leaving , the food was simple but good !! I will come back and try their lunch menu next time for sure !"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my new favorite spots! The food is incredible! The gravy is insane! The service is always excellent. There's usually a wait but it's well worth it! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Always the best chili cheese omelet I've ever had.  My family and I come here often (at least once a week).  Great coffee, great service, super welcoming, and I've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! My friend and I picked it on a whim because the reviews were great and the pictures on Yelp looked great. We were both so happy we ended up choosing this place! We went for brunch around 10 am and the place was pretty full already, but no wait time. You could just tell everyone around us was having a great experience, whether they had been there a dozen times or were newbies like me and my friend. The wait staff and every employee working there was super friendly, our waitress, Lourdes, was super sweet and made us feel so comfy and at home. People are not kidding when they say on the other reviews that you feel at home, you honesty do. Lourdes was friendly and talkative, but also gave us plenty of time to order since she knew me and my friend were catching up from not seeing each other for a while. She or another waiter were always refilling our coffee cups, which I love since I guzzle down coffee. Their coffee specifically was delicious and so was my homemade biscuits and gravy!! This place you could tell really did make their gravy from scratch and their biscuits were fluffy and had a really great, almost a bit sweet flavor which I LOVED. My friend got eggs Benedict which looked super yummy and both of our hash browns were cooked to perfection! My total was $12 which you can't beat since I was full and happy so I made sure to leave a generous tip because Lourdes deserved it. I will definitely come to this place again and recommend it to anyone in the area!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for brunch before we went to the outlet. We found this restaurant on Yelp! I wanted steak and my boyfriend wanted a sandwich and they had just that, and more! There's great service from the minute you step outside the doorstep and through your whole dining experience! I think the owners work there too, you can tell since they ask you how your meal is. This really shows dedication to their restaurant. Not the mention, the portions are huge and generous! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot, fast service, great prices and definitely some of the best food in town!! Weekends are generally very busy, so definitely plan to wait a little."}
{"text":"You know what don't take my word for it just go you will be so glad you did! Amazing place!"}
{"text":"As a lot of people have said, get the Cali Omelette with hash browns and you won't regret it.  Add Cholula if that is your thing.

Be prepared to wait if you come around breakfast or lunchtime most days, especially on Sunday.  I like to bribe people for their spot on the list but not everyone is as much of a scoundrel as I am."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo, I've been here a couple times..  And i must say, it's by far THEE BEST breakfast you're gonna get in Vegas and some of THEE BEST customer service you're gonna get anywhere! I took my boyfriend for breakfast the other day to see if he had the same experience and he was amazed and highly recommends this. I forget the manager's name. Female. Very nice lady. She greeted us as we walked up, with a big bright smile and came over half way through our meal to make sure everything was to our standards. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The food is amazing. My boyfriend loved the bacon, which staff highly recommended on my first visit. My boyfriend won't eat anyone's eggs but mine. He tore those eggs up.... ALL OF THEM!! And finally, I must compliment them on the atmosphere... They didn't do too much or too little. The temperature was comfortable and the sweet aroma of coffee filled the air... But not too much. The place was cozy, just spacious enough, and very family friendly. The only thing they could do better is nothing. Keep up the good work guys. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, great food, great service and friendly staff and owner. He even came to talk to us, made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"This place was packed on friday in the afternoon.  Luckily we got in just when the crowd was slowing down.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was delicious!  They take some time to make your order, but thats how you know they make it fresh and cooked properly.  Mr mama himself comes out to greet and check on every customer which is nice.  This place will be on my bookmarks!"}
{"text":"The service here sets the standard and the portions are huge! I have never been treated better by a team of workers (manager, servers, greeters) in one sitting. Keep it up Mr Mamas!

This appears to be a place that the locals frequent. Prices are average, food was served very quickly, quantities were huge, taste was very good, and must I repeat- service was impeccable. Get there!"}
{"text":"We walked in at 1:45 p.m. on a Sunday and they close at 2.  Asked if it was too late to get seated and was told \"absolutely not, come on in!\"  The place was crowded and there were still people waiting to get seated; always a good sign.  We were seated in less than 5 minutes and told who our waitress was going to be.  Jenna was warm, friendly, and accommodating from the beginning of our dining experience until the end.  My son and I both had omelettes; mine was mushrooms, cheese, and spinach, while his was a Cali omelette.  Both were large and served with potatoes and toast.  We couldn't eat it all.  The food was fresh, well cooked, and tasty!  The next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely hit up Mr. Mama's for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for another amazing recommendation! We talked up to Mr. Mama's on a Saturday morning and was immediately created by a gentleman who opened the door for us and guided us to our table. Everyone was friendly and cheerful making us feel right at home. 

Service here is beyond 5 stars and the food is just as good. We took other Yelper's advise and got the Country Fried Steak. Good thing we shared because portions here are HUGE! We were told their gravy is made with three kinds of meat plus honey and asked if we wanted samples before we ordered. Our waitress Julie was thoughtful and detailed when it comes to checking up on us and making sure everything was perfect. 

Leaving Mr. Mama's was no different than arriving. We said our goodbyes and the door was popped opened as we walked out. Service like this is hard to come by and makes for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Long wait ... it was okay.. the food was not worth the wait... nothing stranded out and I tried everyone's good lol"}
{"text":"Staff is always polite and they accommodate large parties with ease. The French toast is lite and fluffy, fresh cinnamon rolls are delicious, pancakes are large fluffy and good as well. Hash browns are made to perfection and they have no issues making them crispy the way I prefer them. A good breakfast/brunch spot which has been consistent over multiple visits."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Mr.Mamas, I'm so happy to see them in their new location (ahem, only across the street from where I live) I can literally walk there in a few minutes. The place is a lot bigger. I remember when this place was the 50 ' s Diner. There is definitely more room for parking which is a plus! The same great service from the servers.

We ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and steak n eggs. The chocolate chip pancakes are still fluffy and yummy. 

We ordered our steak medium rare, which to me is red and pink in the middle and grill on the outside. I got my steak and it was completely red inside! I like medium rare but not rare. It almost looked blue in my opinion. But the server was kind enough to take it back to get cooked a little more. I was a bit shocked that I could hear the cooks talking in the back about my steak and pretty much saying it was medium rare and instead they cooked it to medium. Oh wells! I don't like making a big fuzz. The steak was still flavorful when it came out the second time and this time it was medium, which was okay. 

The owner is so kind as always! He makes up for the cook's comments. Definitely will come here more often since it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"Legit spot!! If you're in Vegas and don't mind driving the 5 minute away from the strip, this is the spot to go to. The greeter was cool and very helpful/informative. Our waitress Jazmine, was very attentive to our table! Give this place a shot, I'm so glad I did!"}
{"text":"From The moment I walked in,I was greeted with great customer service.The food was flavorful,served in a timely manner,and good sized portions.If your in the mood for some homemade food,great price and clean environment,this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Having been on the hunt for the best breakfast spot in town for as long as I can remember, I am finally ready to declare a winner. I have been to Mr Mama's on numerous occasions since my first review and they are consistently good and delicious breakfast diner food. 

The service is excellent and the food is always spot on. I can't think of a single thing I have ordered here that hasn't been a great value or great tasting. Mr. Mama makes sure to make the rounds and chat with every single party. This is the epitome of a true mom and pop spot that is doing it right."}
{"text":"Great place, the owner is super friendly and makes you feel so welcome to his restaurant. All the staff is really friendly and very helpful. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food was awesome. I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy and my husband got the Denver omelet which he loved and couldn't get enough of. If you looking for a great breakfast or brunch spot without breaking the bank, this is it!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, great food. A nice little spot away from the strip. The hospitality was amazing. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice authetic breakast while visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here for Breakfast. Food was very delicious. Evryone was very friendly! Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we have to eat here.  Usually a line out the door but great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place.  Their chicken fried steak is great...made in house not frozen and heated up like a lot of places.  The gravy is excellent and I love the fact they let you pass on the toast and will give you a huge pancake at no extra charge instead.  Service is always excellent and the guy at the front keeps everything running smoothly."}
{"text":"Mr Mamas has a great homey feel with fantastic food! The service was very prompt and we were well taken care of. If you're looking for a great little joint, for sure come over to Mr Mamas! This will NOT be my last time coming here, what a great find!"}
{"text":"The Greek wrap and the chilli were delicious. Both a lot of flavor. The spinach omelet had too much cheese and was bland. I didn't care for the hashborwns; they were too oily. The biscuit and gravy was ok.

The service was great. Everyone was really friendly. Be ready to wait. We waited 25 minutes to be seated. The place was packed."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are huge and everything is made with quality ingredients. Our table had the Cali Omelet, Chicken Fried Steak, and the Jenna Wrap. Home fries can come with bell peppers and onions on top. Everything was just delicious!"}
{"text":"So the food was good and the service was excellent!  Great spot to go to for breakfast!! Abby was excellent and the price was pretty reasonable... My only complaint is I paid an extra 1.50 for cholesterol chips in my pancakes and got about 9 chips in it. Overall it was great!!"}
{"text":"Basic breakfast place. Staff works together and the service shows. Good eats, good coffee and even better prices. This place was a gem."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great! The portion is humungous! We had food coma after eating here. I didn't think we order that much though."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for breakfast when I visit las vegas. Mamas French toast was amazing and delicious. The staff was friendly and fast even on a busy day will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to eat and seen good reviews on yelp so we decided to try it.Did not disappoint!!!!This place is five stars from the minute you walk in to the minute you leave.Service,and food were excellent.Had the biscuits and gravy,pancakes,and French toast...all was fabulous.Our server (Lourdes)was very nice and attentive...Everyone was exceptionally nice."}
