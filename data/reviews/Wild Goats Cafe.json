{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked in around 7pm and walked out 15 minutes later, still hungry. Initially we waited a couple minutes to be greeted by the host who was MIA until a cook finally said something to him. We were then sat and told the server would be right with us. About 7 minutes later after we were still waiting on a server and a cook leans over the counter to tell us that a server will be right with us. 7 minutes later we walked out having still not been greeted. The whole time the other servers and cooks passed by us as we looked around. The restaurant wasn't even busy! Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast... had an omelette with ham, peppers, onion and cheese. So fresh.. big chunks of ham and veggies. Lots of flavor. Service was excellent and the vanilla almond coffee was so good. Will return in the future."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to give this place a chance to impress me but it always falls short. I got the Garlic Cajun burger which is a very misleading name. It was mostly just salty and greasy. The tomatoes were still green. The \"black angus\" beef was of low quality like what you would get at any fast food joint. Their sweet potato fries were good though. It seems to me that they need to invest in much better ingredients. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because I see potential in this place. Just try harder!"}
{"text":"Wild Goat is a super main stay for good chow and service... They do have busy, crowded times and kitchen issues sometimes. The goat is a busy family style restaurant not a Bistro and thank heaven Not Denny's , Bob Evans or any of the Plastic Franchise Method Actors.    I'd give it 5 Stars for real people place and 4 1/2 stars most days  for service and food quality."}
{"text":"A solid spot for breakfast. Much better than the chain places. Avocado Benedict is great, and so is the friendly service. They would like to be known for their coffee, but it's average and sometimes weak. If you're a fan of coffee, do yourself a favor and get the dark roast of the day.  This place is now our favorite breakfast spot, consistently good and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful hidden gem in Kent. Food is here is simple and satisfying. After eating here you'll remember what you ate, each meal is a little signature of the place that will keep you coming back.  My menu suggestion: Grilled Tropical Chicken Sandwich"}
{"text":"Variety of pancakes (with peanut butter, bananas, applesauce) make for a really great breakfast!  Their lunch food is good too, I just happen to think of them for their good breakfast food."}
{"text":"The food is okay but over priced. The indoor corners of the store are disgusting as is the bathroom. I quit going there"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last weekend on a sunny day. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, the food was stunning! Got the turkey roll with homemade applesauce and a frozen vanilla chai latté all was delicious and came out very timely! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"went there this past saturday (6-25-16) while biking thru kent...like to try new things and the somethin' somethin' caught my eye...essentially it is three slices of french toast with peanut butter and granola...to say the least i loved it-huge thumbs up for this item...place was close to downtown kent, waitress was superb, and the atmosphere was upbeat...will be back in the future...for my first time, thumbs up for a great item on the breakfast menu.  happy 4th of july weekend to all those at the Wild Goats Cafe"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite breakfast and lunch spots in Kent. Employees are very nice and friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. There usually is a wait for a table, but the longest I've had to wait was 20 minutes. It's a little pricey but really worth it. I highly recommend the spicy bacon mac n' cheese."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today with my girlfriend and the customer service was amazing, as was the food! They had a very extensive menu to choose from, and they have the best pancakes I have ever had! Five stars."}
{"text":"My mother and I have been here most Saturdays for the past five years.  I've had everything on the menu, under most every circumstance. It's not always \"blow your mind\", but it's a consistent value. You get a very good \"bang for your buck\" here.  The soups (when available) are uniformly fantastic. Their corned beef hash is the best breakfast item, and sometimes \"sells out\". The sweet potato fries are the best of that kind that I've had. Everything else is at the absolute worst, average.  What *really* sets The Goats apart is the service. It is the standard that I hold every restaurant to: even those with much heftier price tags. It's family-friendly, date-friendly, solo-friendly... environment-wise, the pinnacle."}
{"text":"Probably the best place for breakfast in Kent, hands down. It's the only place that serves scrambled eggs that I happily consume. They also have the BEST French toast, if that happens to be your thing. Service is decent. I've never had an issue with any of the waitstaff. If you happen to be waiting for a table, they can get you seated relatively quickly.   One missing star only because the prices aren't really college budget friendly. Almost $8 for a breakfast platter with eggs, meat, hash browns, and toast...not always something that I can afford but worth it when I can."}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Plenty of seating and a roomy parking lot. Good coffee! \"Somethin Somethin\" pancakes: blueberries, house made granola, and peanut butter...wow!!!  Only thing that would made them better is the offer of real maple syrup.   Griddle Fried Cheese Grits...awesome.   Huge menu, something for everyone, plenty of vegetarian options thank you very much!"}
{"text":"I go long spells without going to Wild Goats and I have no idea why. Every time I go, I'm so pleased with my meal. The omelet was wonderfully prepared with chorizo, avocado and tomatoes. The cheesy grit \"cake\" was just ok. A little dry but I dipped it in more salsa for some added flavor."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  I can't speak for their dinner menu as I haven't eaten it yet, but their breakfast and lunch are amazing.  Each item on the menu is unique in its own way - and I have yet to choose something I didn't like.  Their prices are pretty cheap which is nice.  I think most breakfast dishes average around $10.  Well worth the little bit extra that you might save if you went to somewhere cheaper, because the food is good quality.  The staff is super friendly as well, which makes it feel like a very welcoming place.  And if you like coffee you will love it here as they serve local Bent Tree coffee.   You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"The boss is sooooo nice, the food is goooood!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and the atmosphere was exactly what I wanted in a college town diner. Upon first glance at the menu, I felt the food was a bit pricey for breakfast/brunch. When the food came out I was pleasantly assured that the price was worth it though as I could tell the food was made with quality ingredients. My bacon was a bit undercooked, but the free substitution of a bagel for toast was a unique option. Overall, it was a good experience, not great, but I would definitely recommend and will certainly be back to get more of their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious, filling portions and interesting options. Take your time with the menu. Lots to choose from. Local Bent Tree Coffee. Would recommend. Wish I lived closer so I could come by more often!"}
{"text":"Wild Goats is a treasured establishment in the fine city of Kent.  They serve both breakfast and lunch, though I will say that breakfast is definitely their specialty.  There are many unique creations, and their ingredients taste fresh.  I feel like the value of their lunch items is not as great as the breakfast, but if you order the right thing (my favorite is the Californian), you're in for a tasty meal.  They also serve some bomb hot chocolate, ice cream, and breakfast pastries."}
{"text":"Quirky and adequate are two adjectives that come to mind. Prompt service and good deals on Fridays. It's nice to have a good, local breakfast place so closet to Kent. A good alternate to the IHOP experience of \"my waitress has worked a 12 hour shift and she's crying, but also trying to give me stellar customer service so I can tip her because the corporation doesn't pay her a living wage\""}
{"text":"We went here for the first time since the remodel a few weeks ago, and it was great. I love going to little local breakfast places, and this is one of my favorites. The place is so much bigger now that they remodeled, and the flow is much easier. The service is always great here -- it's nice to see the same waiters/waitresses when you go back, and they remember you from the last time you visited. This time, I got Southwest Benedict. It was good, but don't be fooled -- the salsa is actually just chunks of tomato and onion, which I was bummed out about. But overall, it was delicious and filling."}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning, time to visit another breakfast joint!  We got to the restaurant around 9 and we were able to be sat right away. The servers were very attentive and quickly took our orders.  They did a great job of keeping out glasses full and coffee hot! As soon as our daughters food was ready they brought it out right away. Now, they did not have any type of kids menu and so for our 19 month old were got her a small fruit bowl and a bagel (they were $3 each! Little pricy, especially given the size and not so great quality of the fruit bowl.)  I got the avocado benedict. I wasn't sure how it would be prepared and it ended up coming out as a eggs benedict with sliced avocado on the side. Not bad, but next time I'll try something different. The yogurt parfait was pretty good, it had blueberries and granola.  It was a bit of a drive from our home, so I could see us going again if we were already in the area. Don't think we'll make a special trip just for breakfast. There are other places that are closer and just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The food isn't the best, I had a turkey melt and it was canned turkey on the sandwich which made the bread soggy and gross. The prices are very high and all the sides are sold separately making the bill more expensive in the end. Service was decent that's the only reason I'm giving two stars."}
{"text":"Had a very delicious and unique breakfast this morning. Why isn't it listed under food category? Just listed as tea and cofee."}
{"text":"I have always adored this place! It has been about 8 years since I last dined here and boy did I miss it! My dad and I came here for breakfast on a weekday and had a very enjoyable experience.   Our waitress was super friendly which always makes the experience better. I ordered the Smoked Gouda Omelette and my Dad ordered the Traditional breakfast. They give you so much food here! The bread for the toast (we ordered wheat) was so delicious! You can tell that it's from a local bakery. The bacon was absolutely delicious! I wish I had ordered extra bacon.   The last finishing touch that impressed both my dad and I was after we paid our waitress asked if we wanted to take drinks to go- Heck Yes we did! We acted like happy little school children after that."}
{"text":"I decided to visit for the first time since college.  I had a doctor's appointment nearby.  Anyway, seeing as how they were a coffee shop back then, I expected a different atmosphere than I was given.  There was a man right at the door and that was a little creepy, but he was so friendly.  I asked for a frappucino and the guy behind the counter said he couldn't make one.  The first guy, the greeter, told him he could using their ice cream flavors.  Whatever.  I'm not picky.  I asked for a peanut butter chocolate frappucino.  It was $2.99.  I didn't try it till I got out to the car and was well on my way.  It tasted like a cold chocolate flavored coffee with unblended ribbons of peanut butter.  Needless to say, I stopped at Starbucks on my way home.  I'm only giving 3 stars; not based on food, but for the service.  Those guys were adorable."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat for breakfast, lunch, and they just recently opened for dinner too. I would recommend this to anybody who likes any kind of food. This is a truly exceptional restaurant."}
{"text":"This little breakfast/lunch spot is greasy spoon for those I like to call \"granolas.\" Anyways, they have great diner classics with healthful additions.  All in all, great stuff. It is a  nice place to take the folks for lunch on a Saturday when they come in to visit."}
{"text":"I walked in thinking this place was a coffee house and found myself walking into more of a combination Denny's / truckstop diner.   And it's like walking in the front diir if church... everyone turns and stares when you walk in.  Not exactly the scene I was looking for so I headed to Tree City coffee instead.  Mucho better."}
{"text":"Good food but I will always check before seated how many waitresses are working. Really only one working entire place! Do u think anyone else could help her? I don't even know if it is worth going back with owners that have attitudes like that! the owners and managers should be ashamed of themselves! I understand call offs and no shows, but they should have a plan in place to help that poor girl out. If she was my daughter I would be in the managers face, you don't treat employees like that."}
{"text":"We stopped for Sunday breakfast with almost an hour before a play started. The wait staff said it was enough time. With five minutes before curtain, our meals had not arrived. As we were leaving, they arrived in plastic sacks. $33 for a cold breakfast with plastic forks.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've visited this cafe multiple times, normally ordering a delicious meal of pancakes. I ordered eggs Benedict once before, and then again yesterday. Shortly after I consumed the eggs Benedict yesterday, I came down with food poisoning and was uncontrollably sick for 12 hours. This has never happened to me in my life. I will never return to this restaurant as it serves unsafe food to customers."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was amazing, generous portions, nice crispy hash browns, great coffee, nice friendly staff and service.   I don't know what happened since then but the overall quality of the place has gone down. They've messed up my orders a few times, the portions are getting smaller, the presentation of the food is getting sloppy, and the hash browns are more like burnt crispy mashed potatoes than hash browns.   I really loved this place the first time there, but every visit after has been worse and worse. Hopefully the staff gets its act together if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"My fav greesy spoon! I go here when I can and leave happy... something about the atmosphere is great and the staff has been around for a long time so they're pros!!! GO HERE after long night out!"}
{"text":"This place has always had issues in my opinion. The food has usually been decent but in the past the service sucked.NOW, the food is good, service was very good, but the food is really pricy.  $3.25 for toast. $9.50 for a breakfast sandwich. $27 for breakfast for 2 seems like too much."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for breakfast now (I'll have to try lunch some time). My first experience was quite good food wise. I ordered the pancakes and eggs after asking the server, \"pancakes or french toast?\" to which he replied quick and with confident, \"the pancakes.\" He was right, those were some nice pancakes. I also ordered the hot chocolate, which was large, covered in a generous amount of whipped cream, and quite yummy.  My second experience at Wild Goats was fine, but not as good. I had the salsa omelet with hash browns. I was expecting a wet salsa, but it was a pico, which is fine, just not what I had imagined in my head. The omelet was typical. The hash browns were not hot enough. The must have had to wait for something else. It was a fine meal, but nothing to write home about.  Both times the service was exceptional. I had the same waiter, and I have to say that he is in the running for my favorite waiter of all time. Not just friendly, he tends to keep tabs on you, so I never felt like I was lacking anything. That's a good feeling to have in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place for months now, but I never seem to have the time or a good excuse to go.  I've pursued their menu online so many times that when i finally walked in the door today, I already knew what to order.  Wild Goats has a very cute interior.  If it weren't so busy, I would park myself at one of the tables all day to study (and maybe I will if I can determine an \"off-peak\" time).  While there were a few college students here, it wasn't completely overrun with undergraduates like many Kent establishments are.  As much as I hate to use this word, the place has a very \"chill\" vibe to it.  We were seated right away and our waitress came by for drink orders almost immediately.  I's say that the service here is practically perfect.  The staff are friendly without being intrusive.  Our water glasses were always full, but I never felt bothered by the waitress' presence.  After all of my salivating over the menu, I was a bit disappointed in the execution.  Honestly, I really think we were there at an off-time.  I could taste the potential in my food....but it wasn't quite up to par.  I ordered the grilled peanut butter and banana on their chocolate bread.  The PB and banana were gooey and delicious, but I felt uncertain about the bread and it took me a while to figure out why.  I first I thought the chocolate bread was too bitter and overpowered the sandwich, but upon closer inspection, I found that the bottom of the sandwich was actually burnt.  Burnt flavor just doesn't compliment PB very well.  I was bummed, but I'm sure it was a rare mistake and I'm not going to hold a grudge.  For my side I chose the sweet potato fries, which were god.  The boyfriend had the \"bavarian\" which is a sausage sandwich on a pretzel roll with sauerkraut, onions, and cheese.  He felt that his was poorly assembled.  He described it as if they plopped the sausage in the middle of the bun, and then surrounded it with the toppings...so the bites from the ends were all toppings, and bites in the middle were all sausage.  Despite our lackluster experience, we are very hopeful that it was just an off-day and definitely plan to return again."}
{"text":"It sucks to see all the negative reviews for this place. I've always had a great experience.   I'm not ashamed that I have been known to go here several times a week for dinner. The weekday special are just unbeatable. $2 dogs on Monday, $1 breakfast items on Wednesday, $3 burgers on Thursday, and 42% off your food bill on Friday, every week 3 p.m. - close. I can't even make dinner for that price.  I hardly ever come here on the weekends due to the fact that it's very busy and without the deals the menu is a little expensive for me. But they do serve food made with local and organic ingredients which will obviously cost a little more. So I get why the prices are a little higher. Every once in awhile I treat myself on a Saturday morning to one of their vanilla chai lattes, another favorite.   My advice: Try going on a weekday for dinner. Take advantage of the deals. Try the ice cream. Your faith in Wild Goats might be restored."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had a veggie melt and sweet potato fries. I was amazing. The atmosphere is nice and laid back. The people are very friendly. Definitely worth a try. I will be returning any time that I am in Kent."}
{"text":"I want to love Wild Goats. It's a quirky cafe near campus, and the menu has a lot more on offer than your standard diner fare. But every time I've visited this place, I've been disappointed. Don't get me wrong - the food is good. But it's overpriced, and the service is always EXTREMELY slow. I've even had waitstaff forget about my table. When half of the tables were empty - it's not like they were slammed.   I don't think I'll give Wild Goats another try - there's no shortage of sandwich places in Kent, and if I want breakfast, I'm better off heading to Rise and Shine Cafe nearby or splurging at Blue Door in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to grab breakfast here for a while and finally made it. First of all, they serve local Kent Bent Tree coffee which is a huge plus. Delicious coffee. The place is small but cute and I enjoyed the whimsical decor. Bacon raining down from egg clouds and a city made of pancake stack buildings!  I ordered the country eggs Benedict, which came like typical eggs Benedict minus the hollandaise sauce and with rich sausage gravy instead. Yum. I got hashbrowns as my side and they were pretty much the perfect mix of greasy and fresh. My husband got the Mexican eggs Benedict I believe it was called? It had spicy chorizo and he enjoyed it. He got the Gouda bacon Mac and cheese as his side and it was smoky and delicious.   My only complaint is that prices are a LITTLE steep for breakfast given the area. Each of our meals came in just under $11 and since we're locals, we know there are other breakfast joints with equally good food and choices where the meals come in more around $8. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"We love Wild Goats! Having recently moved to Kent, my husband and I have quickly become regular patrons. We like the specials- especially the Wednesday $1 menu in the evening! Their turkey burgers are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Whether it's a traditional breakfast or something more modern, hip, and trendy, Wild Goats Cafe has you covered. This place's service rocks, the food is tasty, the prices are respectable, the quantities are satisfying.. I love \"The Goat\"!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices and super-friendly staff.  I pretty much eat from the breakfast menu (served all day!) but never heard anyone complain about the rest of the selection. Mostly your basics, nothing fancy here.  Keep an eye on the hours, they aren't open all day nor at night. Mostly a breakfast/lunch place.  Also: home-made breads & muffins!"}
{"text":"A gem in Kent. For the days when you just can't take another fast food burger (which seems to be all that is around the area) you can go to 'Goats!!  The service has a feel of down-home, everyone-is-a-regular, but that does not bother me! I've had a wonderful breakfast sandwich and chocolate chip pancakes if you head there in the morning.  For the lunch crowd, I recommend all of the sandwiches, I have not had a bad one!   The apple/blue cheese salad is also a nice light option!  The only thing I would not recommend here: Beer Cheese Soup (its thick and nacho-pastey).  A wonderful place to bring friends and family for a great cup of coffee and good food.  I leave satisfied every time!"}
{"text":"Priceses are outrages 4 of us went in for a quick breakfast we had 3 scones 1 small plate of scrambled eggs (that's 2eggs) 3 cups of coffee 1 cup of tea. $20.75 I suggest that you go to Bob Evans and for $20.75 you can get a real breakfast."}
{"text":"Awful place. Food was cold and service was terrible. It seemed they just took food from the freezer and put it in the microwave. The prices are also terrible. $4 for two crappy eggs and $9 for avocado Benedict and the avocado seemed like it had been sitting out for weeks.   When i asked for a refill of hot water, the waitress filled my cup only 1/4 and said \"that's fine\".   On a another note, the waitress tried to steal my friends phone and racially profiled my friend TSA style. I will never come back to this horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Love me some wild goats Cafe!!! Breakfast all day and so many options. Even the lunch is amazing hot dogs, hamburgers, wraps and sandwiches. I loved everything about this place, everything from the art on the walls to the friendly staff. Huge portions and so many options for sides. And they have a different special everyday. I got the scrambler and it was so big I need a box. Eggs, meat, hash browns covered in sausage gravy and cheese. It was truly amazing. Such a gem in Kent and feels like your walking into your funky grandma's house I love it here and will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is my parents favorite spot to go to and were very excited to see that they now serve dinner (not sure when this happened, might have been a few months ago). The Dinner menu it self is just a mix of lunch and a few added items, but of course breakfast is still served all day ( WHO could not appreciate a place that serves breakfast all day!). The meals were any where from $6-$14 and were large portions. This place is the stereotypical diner spot that people look for when visiting the mid west. It has booths and tables so easy for a group of a couple to go in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Kent! I love the chicken curry soup. It leaves me wanting more every time!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to weigh in on an old friend.   Started going here in 2007 whenever I was in town.  GREAT breakfast  and lunch choices prepared well and quickly.  Nice, healthy, fruit and wholegrain choices and a very friendly atmosphere.  If you're a student, THIS IS where to take the rents! They'll worry less. (like in most college towns, you can get very bad food in Kent, so be careful)."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy. It can get a bit crowded for breakfast, but it's a cozy little restaurant. The menu is a bit expensive, but I think you get a pretty large amount of food. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. I've only come here for breakfast/brunch, and haven't been disappointed. I normally get pancakes, french toast, or eggs with bacon. I definitely recommend going here for a leisure morning breakfast!"}
{"text":"In the hit-n-miss category, they're more miss.  It's a shame there's so much potential.  Service is the biggest loser. They have some servers that get it and others you just cringe when they approach your table.   The food is generally good.  They make attempts at having a fresh menu with some healthy options, mixed in with the classic American unhealthy diner fare.  Big negative, there always seems to be flies or gnats inside, kinda gross for a food establishment.   I enjoy the turkey roll on pretzel bun and their turkey burgers.  They are on the Twitter, but they're sporadic in giving the daily specials and coffee."}
{"text":"Mm. I really, really want to like this place, after I was taken there for brunch this weekend while visiting Kent.  The space is a refurbished Friendlies, and I love that they've kept the counter area for diners who don't mind sitting at the bar.   Some of the food was really great, and the emphasis on local ingredients was nice. I really enjoyed the house made jalapeno sausage and their cheesy grits, cooked on the griddle to make a neat crusty slab of tastiness.  But there were problems.   The service was slow bordering on just plain bad, and our server made repeated passes of our table when we tried to order or ask for a refill and simply skipped by with a promise to come back \"in a minute.\"  The scrambled eggs tasted like they came from a mix or powder and tasted overcooked and rubbery - a real shock after their advertised focus on local ingredients.  We decided to split one of their massive cinnamon rolls with the table...and instead of serving it in the beautiful condition it came in the case, our server put it into the microwave way too long, taking it from a really appetizing confection to a tasty roll covered by a really sickly looking yellowish-white sludge because of the cream cheese frosting breaking down.  The sausage gravy isn't bad, but the biscuit served with it is really tiny - for $4.50 for a half order, I expected a larger portion.  I wouldn't be opposed to going back for another try, but it's a shame that I'm already putting together \"things to avoid\" mental notes for such a promising place."}
{"text":"Home cooking in a very Kent sorta way. That is, a heavy dose of hippydippy, but Wild Goats manages to not be too crunchy. Menu is creative and consistently good. Cheese grits and the Mac & Cheese are favorites. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"To say 'I used to come here in college' would be redundant, but it is true. This was my go-to for a breakfast after a night out. Each time I Have been back since has been a strike out. Either they are out of one thing or screw up my order. Today was no different. My hash browns came out AT LEAST 10 minutes before the rest of my food. And I guess this is no fault of theirs, but my side salad came out with a heaping pile of bacon. I didn't make them re make it because the food took so long to get, but really? I feel like when you order a sandwich SANS MEAT then they should also by proxy eliminate BACON on your salad. Whatever. I'm not a vegetarian, just health conscious so I just picked it off. No use wasting the salad. But if I was a vegetarian I would be pissed!"}
{"text":"Service was great here! So friendly and quick! He had forgot to get one of us an orange juice until we got our meals and he took it off the bill, which was extremely gracious!   The buckeye milkshake was on point! They bring out the mixing cup so you get allll of it! And the mocha came in a giant cup and was very decadent.   I had the avocado Benedict, which overall had great flavor. I would have rathered the avocado be under the egg instead of around it cold but the hollandaise sauce was great. Now the griddle cheese grits were atrocious. Maybe I just don't like grits but I though I had licked the bottom of a cast iron pan or something. Thankfully there was a side of bacon on the table witch I ate and it was melt in your mouth delicious."}
{"text":"Wild Goats Cafe is by far the most bang for your buck breakfast place in Kent.  The servers are all very friendly and the food is great.  There have even been two instances where I was given my meal for free because of how long it took when it actually didn't seem very long at all.  Plus you've got to love a place that has almost exclusively booths. Great Service, Great Food, Great Decor... What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food here is always tasty and I love their milkshakes. I will say however that I can't give it 5 stars because every time we've gotten breakfast here is always comes out cold. I've been much happier when I go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food and great coffee.   I have been to the restaurant several times, but only for breakfast. I usually stick to the basics at breakfast, so the menu's sweet offerings haven't been tried.   Favorites include the jalapeño sausage and the tasty grilled cheesy grits;  the latter is a choice with some breakfasts as a side, but it's dense, delicious and more than enough as a meal on its own.    Have always received good service from the servers, who check regularly to top off your coffee. Recommended."}
{"text":"Looking for the local Starbucks and found Wild Goats.  Very good service, very good coffee and very good corned beef hash.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Service: absolutely awful! Extremely slow, and no, I don't want people to grovel, but seemingly no awareness/care of slow, awful service. Went around 1:00pm and they were busy, but the service continued to be slow well after patrons had cleared out.   *The last time that I went to this place, I had to leave without ordering because it was taking forever to get my server to even begin with a drink order. So, this seems to be their modus operandi.   They ran out of tomato for my chicken salad sandwich and when asked about replacing it, I suggested avocado. She said it would cost me extra. Fair enough, but I think tomato is important to that sandwich, so, I dunno, maybe make it right?   Food is pretty delicious. Great bleu cheese dressing and the avocado salad has a nice mix of walnuts and apples and avocados. Chicken salad is the best I've ever had.   I don't think I can come back here. Repeat bad service sucks. If you need to hire another server, I think you can afford it. Always pretty busy here."}
{"text":"Lots of really good vegetarian options and the bacon mac and cheese tastes AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Came here on a snowy day and it was packed.  There was a wait so we decided to sit at the bar area.  The waitress was very friendly and took great care of us.  The food was good too.  The only reason why I gave Wild Goats Cafe 3 stars is because we ordered simple breakfast items (toast, eggs, bacon, sausage) and I thought it took way to long to cook our food.  Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place had been very good but, now the food is mediocre and the prices are too high. it costs the two of us $30 for breakfast. do yourself a favor and find another breakfast joint. they're all over the Kent and Stow area."}
{"text":"So coffee, $2.99 with refills. Ok.  But a DRY scone made worse by microwave heating at $4.99 is ridiculous. It was maybe 3 inches halved into triangle.  Manager mentioned an expanding pastry menu, but trust me... order real eggs or some sandwich. $8 plus tax and 20% tip = 10 for cold coffee (yep) and stale scone.  This place has been my go to since it opened, but I will stick to the main menu, thanks!"}
{"text":"Twin Goats is a great ok place for breakfast and lunch. Good service can get busy at times on weekends."}
{"text":"If you're old school Kent you remember when the Zephyr served it's awesome coffee, bread, and other delicious foods. Well, Wild Goats is the replacement. They started out over on Rt. 59 where Pulp is now and quickly realized that the old Friendly's across from the Kent Free library would be a better fit. You can get catering for parties from them (awesome quiches) and also enjoy a satisfying meal up until 4pm each day. My favorites are the pancakes (peanut butter and banana style), blt, eggs and toast, and the Bibb salad. Excellent coffee, tea, and smoothies. Great selection of baked goods to eat there or take home. You can't be disappointed with the meal and prices when you go to \"The Goat\""}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Kent! I particularly like their breakfast but have been disappointed by some of their lunch options. I recommend the Scrambler with vegetables. It's an enormous amount of food and really tasty. I also really like their sweet potato fries and the fact that you can order a fruit cup as a side dish for a little bit extra.  Nice atmosphere with a nice mix of guests. This place is loved by college students, professors, families, and seniors!"}
{"text":"My expectations were high for this cafe because of the favorable Yelp ratings and one of the people I was with praised it for the quality of food and service. I can't say I was impressed with either.  I ordered the spinich omelette and hashbrowns, and a bagel with cream cheese as a side. The omelette was subpar, as the ingredients inside were not cooked to standard. The grilled onions were cooked fine, but the spinich hadn't touched the grille and looked like it was just placed in the middle of the lukewarm 3-egg omelette. The bagel and creamcheese was basic and they served it at lukewarm temperatures.  All of these gripes about quality of food could probably be attributed to the terrible service our party recieved. The waitress simply did not pay attention to our table and we sat wallowing for two seperate 15 minute periods waiting for drinks to be refilled and our check to come.  Overall I should give this place two stars, but since it was homecoming weekend I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. However, do not get your expectations up; the prices are directly attributed to the service you will get."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in Kent!   Wonderful omelettes in some unique combinations, fantastic eggs benedict, yummy french toast and pancakes, tasty hashbrowns and GREAT coffee from local Bent Tree coffee roasters (dark roast is where it's at!)   Usually excellent service, with attentive coffee and water refills."}
{"text":"I frequented Wild Goats as a student at Kent State, and now 3 years post graduation I drive 45 minutes to come back to my favorite spot! The service is stellar, food is delicious, and the chai teas are the best around!"}
{"text":"Their food is good but the prices are seriously getting ridiculous. It's difficult to find anything below $10 - even just simple eggs, potatoes, and toast. My boyfriend usually gets a side of pancakes with his breakfast but an order of pancakes here is $5.99! Come on, people."}
{"text":"I love coming here on a Saturday or Sunday morning for breakfast. The coffee is great, especially their flavored coffees. They have a cinnamon coffee that I love. The breakfast food is pretty basic, but they have gouda cheese that you can choose on your breakfast sandwich or omelet that alone makes it very different from Bob Evans. The other thing that makes it stand out is the crowd. You get a sense that this is where the artists and professors go for breakfast. I have also never had bad service. It tastes like they use very fresh ingredients.  All of the servers are particularly nice. I guess the only bad thing is that the place is so small and weekends are very busy, so sometimes you have to wait a while. Then again, all places are like that on the weekends. I try to get there early before the rush."}
{"text":"Loved wild goats! Went there for the first time Monday morning and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I got the avocado omelet and it came with a yogurt parfait and toast. I also got the mocha, which was good, but more like a dessert than a coffee drink. I wouldn't say they're extremely pricey though, when you consider how much food you're getting. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was the best part of our experince.  I had a ok omlet $10.  My wife had the Texas French toast.  I belive she failed the ciniman challenge that the French toast provided her.  I have never seen so much ciniman served on a thin slice of bread... so much for Texas....  Coffee was ok."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here, and I have been a few times. I like it, but I don't love it.  Imfirst came here on a crowded Sunday with a party of six. The restaurant is small and basically has no tables or room to accomodate that, which made it hard and delayed us leaving for home, meaning I had to pay an extra night for the dogs to be kennelled. We got seated, separatelu to try and save time.   I have been here a few other times with my mother in law and husband.  I have tried the beer cheese and onion soup. The beer cheese soup was jus okay - I love a good beer cheese soup, but this one has a funny aftertaste and just not a very tasty / good cheese for this soup. I have not ordered it again. The onion soup was really salty and had a bitter taste to it. The cheese / bread / soup ratio was also all wrong.  My Husband loves the turkey here, and it is really good. The turkey on the pretzel bun is worth coming here. I got one of the peanut butter and jelly sandwichs on wheat the first time I came and got it. I also have tried an apple, cheese, and something else on white that was great, although the bread really scratched my mouth up.  This place is cute and worth trying. The sandwiches are quite tasty."}
{"text":"We come here occasionally for breakfast, and it's always good. But our favorite is the weeknight evening specials, especially $1 breakfast items on Wednesday. Want a huge pancake for dinner? That will be $1. Want some bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast? $1 each. My wife and I stuff our faces for way less than $10 total between the two of us. It's awesome.   Ron Swanson would approve.  It gets a little crowded, that's the only drawback. Just depends when you're there."}
{"text":"Great specials, cozy and small atmosphere, and excellent service! However, the very best thing you could ever order here is their vanilla latte. It's ah maze ing. Yep."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch - bacon, Granny Smith apple and smoked Gouda on really nice bread. Accompanied by creamy pepper jack chicken soup, and a solid cup of coffee. Fantastic service! A repeat visit any time I am back in Kent."}
{"text":"Wednesday $1 night breakfast is perfect for college students that want to go out, but are poor (me...). You can choose from the list of various breakfast items such as eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, hash browns, etc. and here's the better part, the quality is better than you'd expect for being a dollar. One problem when I went was my friends hash browns were still semi frozen in the center, however, mine were cooked perfectly. I've gone for lunch before as well, and the tomato soup I got wasn't as hot as I'd like it to be, however, their service makes up for the sometimes off temperature of the food."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time but lately can't really find the time. The food is pretty cheap which is great, especially with the portion sizes. I always get the salsa omelet with hashbrowns and white toast. Unfortunately there's always a wait so come early if you can. There's not a ton of parking so for sure carpool. I've never had their lunch but they seem to have great specials. Overall not a bad place and very cute decor!"}
{"text":"I tried out Wild Goats for the first time after I learned of their Buck-Buck Brinner special on Wednesday nights. Basically they have a list of breakfast items (pancakes, hashbrown, sausage, ect.) all of which are $1 each. So you make your own combination and get as many or as few things as you want. It was a very good deal and I like everything I ordered with the exception of the hashbrown which tasted like the frozen supermarket kind. Although what the hashbrowns lacked in quality they certainly tried to make up in quantity.  I then returned to Wild Goats after acquiring a groupon. Their standard menu has a very nice variety of sandwiches and burgers but what interested me the most were the very intriguing (and somewhat pricey) dinner specials. I tried the pepper-jack chicken over a biscuit and was very pleasantly surprised. No soggy biscuits here! I still have no idea how they managed that but I would love to have it again! Overall, I am quite a fan of this place. I do wish their dinner specials were a little more affordable but the rest of the menu fits right in my budget. I will definitely be returning for that brinner special!"}
{"text":"Wild Goat's caffe is my favorite brunch restaurant in Kent! They do a great job of featuring all different kinds of brunch foods on their menu. I would recommend the the chocolate chip french toast or blue berry french toast if you're in the mood for something sweet. If you're more of a hearty breakfast type of person, check out the omelets. Today I chose the avocado, cheddar and tomato omelet sans the bacon, and it exceeded my expectations. The prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food they serve.   The interior of the restaurant is pretty small and can get crowded easily. Sundays seem to be the most popular day, so if you plan on getting brunch go early if you don't want to wait for long periods of time. The main reason why I'm giving the restaurant four stars is because there isn't a ton of parking because half of the lot is reserved for a doctors office."}
{"text":"Decent food. A little pricey for the quality however. The bacon is amazing. Pro tip: if you plan to make a sea voyage to Australia or the like, take some of their biscuits which are similar in taste and texture of hard tack."}
{"text":"Getting to be a regular here for dinner. Wild Goats has a cafe and family restaurant atmosphere. Everything I've had here is delicious and I would recommend the California sandwhich with chicken curry soup. Jacob is an excellent server and always makes sure we're well taken care of. They have amazing specials like $3 burgers on Thursday and 42% off Friday. They also sponsor a child which warms my social justice-y heart"}
{"text":"We recently moved back to the area after seven years. It is still our go to breakfast place. The coffee is perfect. The cinnamon rolls are sinful. Breakfast meats are delicious. Whole we normally go for breakfast, the lunch is good as well. There is a great variety but the menu isn't too big."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant at least 3 times in the past 3 years. Each time, the food was very good. In fact, the breakfast here earned a 5 star Yelp review in 2015. I loved the menu and felt the place had so much to offer. But things change and todays review is very different.  This menu is extensive and a little expensive.  Most items start at $7.00. It seems $2.00 too high across the board. I ordered the Peanut Butter and Banana French Toast. It sounded enticing and the Server told me it was exceptional. Once served, it looked like a sandwich. Served on a plate, cold. It was not visually appealing and tasted like a bad peanut butter sandwich. He ordered two eggs, hash browns and toast, but the toast was not served. The hash browns were burnt black and served cold. He spent the meal time waiting to catch the eye of the server. Simply put, eggs without toast is like tea without lemon. Finally, the Manager visited the table. He listened to the complaints and fixed everything he could. He took away the French Toast and gave me a Cranberry Orange scone that was not filling, but was wonderful. He paid for our entrees. That was generous. We paid for our coffee and the tip. Still, revisiting this restaurant will not be something we do soon. Too much frustration for a Saturday morning. We should have ordered the Omelets. They looked like a five star event."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, and took a group of friends in from out of town here this morning. We love it! The prices are very reasonable (today I got a huge portion of eggs, hash browns, toast, bacon, and a large banana pancake for $9.50!). I have not been disappointed by any of their items, and I really love the creative options they have for eggs benedict. Also, it's very apparent that the food is homemade and fresh. Definitely a great diner for some cheap home cooked food."}
{"text":"Good place.  I have been here a few times and the breakfast is usually pretty good.  Its a little overpriced but it is pretty quality stuff.  I like the eggs benedict, and the dinner specials are a great deal.  The grits on the griddle are very good.  I like this place because it is not a chain and is local to kent with mostly home-made seeming food.  I will be back, it would be 4 stars if it was priced a bit lower.  Overall a good place, servers are good too."}
{"text":"The chorizo and avocado omelet was the best omelet I have ever had at any restaurant.  My wife thought the cheese grits were great.  Good coffee and good service helped make this visit a five star."}
{"text":"Is this actually a 5 star place?  Probably not, but I love Wild Goats for curing my college hangovers, so of course they're getting 5 stars!  I usually come back to Kent once a year, and this is my go-to place for breakfast or lunch.  The food is always consistent and tasty.  I was always a Wild Goats over Mike's Place kind of girl, for no particular reason.  Since I graduated, they massively expanded their menu, including the addition of an ice cream section...but breakfast is still the way to go.  But regardless of what you get: make sure to add on smoked gouda cheese.  Although I haven't had too many items off the expanded lunch menu, I appreciate how many vegetarian options they have.  It's just a good, solid place to go with even the pickiest eater...everyone can find something they'll eat up here.    I also think they have one of the best cups of coffee in Kent. And definitely the best sweet potato fries in the world."}
{"text":"First time here.  Excellent staff.  Had a mishap with my order but was quickly corrected.  My husband said his was good.  They were already out of their famous cinnamon rolls.  Next time.  Manager took great care of us.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to grab breakfast in Kent. I would always run into my poetry teacher here. He was a great dude. The food was always fresh and a good change up from the schwag food I always ate as a bummy drunk stoner in Kent."}
{"text":"I can't complain about anything here.  Quick friendly service and a great alternative to pizza and burgers, especially around KSU.  It's even located across from the Kent Free Library!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on our way back out of town. All I can say is I'm sad I never knew about this place when I was in school. It's great! Everyone is super friendly and the menu isn't huge but they do the food well. I was eyeing the vegetarian sandwiches for a while--they all looked great--but ended up just getting a simple egg breakfast. My husband loved his eggs Benedict (and he is basically an eggs benny connoisseur).   Can I go back in time and frequent this place?"}
{"text":"M- not to wild about this restaurant the menu make promises the kitchen can not keep. I suppose that is true most everywhere and if you were to read in advance what your likely to get you may not order. But my wife couldn't choke it down and it is still talking at me as we speak. I'll be glad when the residue is done.  D- I have had goat; it can be tasty. Sorry to say this food was not.  If you like an omelette that is stuffed with the fixings rather than the fixings mixed in with the egg, than you might like the omelette here.  Hash browns fried just like everywhere else with little to no seasoning.  Sausage was typical.  After looking at a really good well put together menu, I was disappointed.  Not much flavor.  There was an old grease smell too.  Maybe we just caught them in-between a cleaning."}
{"text":"Way too crowded and long wait. To make matters worse even after being seated and ordering our food right away, The table behind us got their food a minute after ours and they were seated 10 minutes later than us.  We had the same amount of people in our party and we even had one kids meal. We had nothing on our order that should have taken that long. Soup sausage pancakes?? Eggs? The server was nice and tried to do the best he could, but it didn't make up for the bad food and the super long wait.        The cheesy grits were burnt and disgusting. When I think of cheesy grits , I think of grits and cheese but these had oregano or thyme onions red peppers and were yellow with a crusty burnt cheese on top. They were crunchy and gritty like they weren't even cooks to begin with before they added all the mystery ingredients.  I think their mystery ingredients were actually in their soup of the day. My ham was burnt and even my toast was burnt.  The  soup of the day was not great and I could've made a better soup at home myself and I am no chef.  After our experience today, we will probably never go back there. They really need to figure out a way to streamline their kitchen so they can stop burning their food and actually get it out on time, too.  Also, I am all about having a creative and eclectic menu, but you have to do the basics right before you can move on to something more complicated. I hope this place improves, but I'm not going back to find out."}
{"text":"The Saturday Night crew is really good. (Much improved since our last visit, which wasn't bad... Just not great). The 2 guys (one is the cook) and 1 gal (server) were terrific. The food was outstanding. I think the key to happiness is smoked Gouda! I have added back the star I removed after the last visit."}
{"text":"I was visiting Kent to drop my sister off at school and wanted a real breakfast as opposed to the Holiday Inn Express watery coffee and yogurt breakfast. This place came recommended so we decided to check it out. We got there and they were busy but greeted us and quickly sat us. Our server was very nice and attentive despite being triple sat (a server's nightmare, I speak from experience). He was quick with the coffee and water. The coffee was a nice change to the coffee flavored hot water I had for the past couple days. I ordered the western omelette with a side of fruit and bacon. The omelette was delicious, the ingredients seemed really fresh and had just the right amount of each ingredient. The fruit cup was good, although its pretty hard to screw that up and the bacon was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. All in all I had a great experience. I had a hard time trying to decide what I wanted and would love to come back and try something else the next time I visit my sister."}
{"text":"Consistently good experience, every time! It can take a little bit longer than most places to get your food, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The breakfast I had taste good, but really salty. The price is way expensive than the food supposed to be. My friend said they use all organic materials to cook, hopefully."}
{"text":"It's a small place but the quality is always consistent. Excellent coffee. Great friendly service. Prices are  very reasonable. Ample parking. Generous portions. It used to be a Friendly's Restaurant which will give you an idea as to its size."}
{"text":"The food tastes great, but it's a little expensive for breakfast food.  My favorite thing though was how you could piece-meal burgers and stuff to make custom items.  My major disappointment was paying for a meal that included poached eggs and for extra toast, and when I went to dip into my poached egg it was almost solidly hardboiled.  :((((("}
