{"text":"I love this place! The delivery is fast and the food is delicious.  The delivery driver cracks me up! He can never seem to find our house even though he's been here a bunch of times, it's hilarious! I usually order the mu shu...get it! I'm a vegetarian so I add tofu to it, no problem. I also love their mixed vegetable and family style bean curd. They never have a problem altering things for me, and delivery is awesome! Get Sui Wok tonight!"}
{"text":"Almost always excellent! We usually order chicken fried rice and house special lo mein. Crab puffs are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The portions and the tastes that come together are too good. There new location is sweet and they still deliver. Either at work or home, it's my first choice."}
{"text":"I've had food delivered from this place probably a total of 5 times.  Each time, it get progessively worse.   This time, we placed an order from my office and of the 3 orders, all were incorrect...items missing, wrong rice, etc.  Not to mention, the chicken in each of the 4 different chicken dishes I've ordered is really cheap and dry, the end pieces of dark meat covered in sauce do not make them edible.  Yes it's cheap and it's great that they deliver, but I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Had a flyer that was left on my door, so I decided to try it for delivery.  Delivery was a little slow and the driver couldn't figure out how to punch a code into the gate.  In order from best to worst: 1. Special Fried Rice.  Rice was delicious and flavorful and all the proteins were cooked perfectly.  2. Egg Roll - very good.  Delivery time made it not quite as crispy as in the restaurant, however.  3. Chicken Lo Mein - the chicken was dry and tough, but the noodles and sauce were delicious.  4, \"Crab\" Puffs.  I put the word crab in quotes as this is what they call it.  However, there wasn't a SHRED of crabmeat in ANY of the puffs.  I was cream cheese stuffed into a wonton and fried.  If I hadn't ordered this last dish, this restaurant probably would have received a higher rating."}
{"text":"I grabbed some lunch here while cruising the downtown area. The food was pretty cheap, but you could tell. Everything tasted like grease, so much so that I finished about 1/4 of my meal and threw it away, and paid for it the rest of the afternoon with an upset stomach. If you have an iron stomach and need a quick bite to eat, this might be an ok place to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way (at all) to come here."}
{"text":"This is the finest china feast you will get in Phoenix.  When Fortune Cookie Buffet on 5th ave and camelback burned down back in the 90's, it took my heart and appetite with the flames.  Just like the legendary bird in which our city was named for, from the ashes of my belly, a new hunger has been born.  For those of you wanting some legit american style chinese food,  I strongly recommend the Sweet and Sour Beef dinner combo.  This combo comes with very generous portions of all of these below listed items:   S&S Beef, Fried Rice, Chicken Lo Mein, 1 egg roll, 2 crab puffs.  Yes, I said beef. No, I am not sharing.  You won't be disappointed, I leave this restaurant with a full belly and smile of contentment every visit."}
{"text":"I remember trying this place 2 years ago and I was not impressed. About a month ago I decided to give them another chance, and tried the Kung Pao Chicken, and since then I have literally been back 6-7 times. For the price it's the best Kung Pao I have ever had. The vegetables are fresh, the sauce is unique and there's plenty of peanuts, an ingredient that imo makes or breaks a good Kung Pao. Their lunch and dinner combos come with fried rice something I don't care for but their fired rice isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"I find it very hard to give anything more than one star if this business is in the business of turning away people before they can even become customers. I wanted to order a lunch combo and a drink. My total came out to about 12 bucks they said I needed a $15 minimum. I was told the portions were a good size so why would I even think about ordering more food especially when this is my very first time ordering from this place. I live less than 3 miles from this place you think they would make an exception for customers that are really close. The problem is that their delivery radius is too large .. They go from 40th av to 47th street and from baseline to northern. They are making their delivery money back on the customers that live closest to their restaurant. I'm sorry but I will never attempt to order from there again too bad I was excited to try a new Chinese place I don't sway from one to the next I mean c'mon Chinese food is chinese food when your talking about take out or delivery.  Ill just have to go somewhere ill be appreciated for trying a restaurant for a first time, I'm sure the next Chinese restaurant will want me to be a repeat customer. Siu Wok peace of advice here, don't ever turn away customers especially new customers its just not good business or profitable, tightn up your delivery radius and then you won't have to have a $15 minimum order set, $10 minimum would do just fine."}
{"text":"Jst ordered for the first time! And it was Yummmmmers!!! :)"}
{"text":"Thank the good lord, they have returned! Praise be to Buddha, they have been on a vacation and have brought back with them the passion and tastes that make great delivery Chinese just that. There is no substitute for that which is Siu Wok. Trust me, we have tried almost every replacement we could find. Pot stickers still great, General Tso still tasty. Service definitely speedy. Yum yum gimme some!"}
{"text":"FAST FAST FAST delivery.  we  order from siu wok pretty regularly. and i do not think we have ever had them take longer than 30 min for the  food to be at our door. usually they will say 30 or 45 min and 15 to 20 min they are ringing the bell.  also in 3 years we have never received an incorrect order.  sometimes we will have several different items some large portions some meal portions and always correct.  oddly in 3 years we have never stepped into the actual place. we have always ordered delivery.  so i cannot speak to how the place is but the people on the phone and delivery drivers are always very very nice.  and portions are huge.  usually its enough for 2 nights of dinner.     the only negative is they close once a year for several weeks for an extended vacation. so its always a bummer to find that out when your craving some walnut shrimp. but they deserve a break."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd best fast chineses food I've had in Phoenix so far!  The shrimp is plump and tastes fresh. Very reasonable prices and huge portions.  The only bad thing is that the cream cheese puff things and eggrolls are dissapointing.  Also, the fried rice is icky.  Always ask for double lo mein and no fried rice......"}
{"text":"This place is more than wonderful! If you haven't been yet ....GO! The food it great.....especially the Kung Pao Veg. ....and the best part is....you get a ton of food for a great price. ...they also deliver which is really great...and I mean deliver...during the huge storm that hit down town last month I saw the siu wok dude drive through the mess on central and deliver food to people in our building...these people are serious! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Best wonton soup I've ever had!   Huge portion full of wontons, broccoli, veggies, shrimp, pork, and chicken.   Absolutely delicious.  Ask for it spicy!  Only problem with Siu Wok is they close for a month around the Chinese New Year."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kung Pao Beef, and House Lo Main 10 minutes before closing, for delivery! And the young lady on the phone was very nice, and reassured me that it was ok to take an order that late at night. My order was delivered in about 20 minutes... tops. Everything tasted great, although my friend ate most of it. Thanks Siu Wok. And the lady that took my order."}
{"text":"Better than I expected.  At first I thought it was a pricey but the amount of food made up for it.  I made two meals out of it plus a snack!  I had the mongollin beef...good quality meat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite! So delicious, every time!  The dinner plates are the best, so much good food at such reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout in Phoenix by far! You definitely get the taste and generous portions you pay for."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese, take out, places in Phoenix! Can't wait for them to re-open down the street  (Central and Thomas)."}
{"text":"When I think of Chinese take out food, Sui Wok is my go to place. Quick delivery and low prices. You get your moneys worth and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Hot food and quick delivery. Nothing to complain about this delivery experience. Unlike other delivery restaurants?Siu Work is one of the best in terms of correct order and quick delivery. Food is ok."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE...  I have ordered from them many times over the last few years and it has always been good. Tonite, i wanted some appetizers and soup. I placed the order online, and paid on line with my credit card. It took 45 minutes for soup, a pupu platter and crab puffs to arrive. The driver asked how I was going to pay and I told him I gave my credit card info online. He gave me the food and left. I immediately went to enjoy my food, and the apps were all lukewarm to cool. . The soup was the only thing hot. I was trying to enjoy what I could as it was rapidly cooling, and my phone rang. It was the restaurant calling back saying that my credit card had not gone thru and I needed to pay cash. I tried explaining that I had given all my info online, but they kept putting me on hold and eventually they hung up. After all that time, the apps were ice cold and inedible. Into the garbage they went. I looked at my online receipt, and sure enough, it did state the amount, the charge tip I entered, but it said cash.. WTF?? next thing, i have the driver back saying I needed to pay cash. I told him to have the manager call me. He didnt seem to understand what i was saying. I called the restaurant back, only to yelled at by the manager and basically told I was lying and the food was hot..  I ended up giving them my credit card number again, this time over the phone. I am not sure how much I am going to be charged, but no matter what it is, it was not worth the poor service and major attitude from the manager, not to mention the cold food. I understand that fried food doesnt travel great, but I do live less than two miles from the restaurant, so it might not be piping hot, but it shouldn't be COLD..  Do NOT order from them. Next time I will get in my car and drive to Chen and Wok on 7th st and Maryland for hot food and no attitude."}
{"text":"i stopped by lunch, i had kung pao chicken, and it come with some appetizer, their kung pao chicken tastes so good, maybe beacause i love spicy. will definitely come back."}
{"text":"made an order for delivery. no sign of it in 45 minutes so i call back and get put on hold until they eventually hang up. i call back 25 minutes later assuming that they are just having a busy lunch only to find out that they never made it. i am hungry and angry (hangry like the beef jerky commercial) and now i have to leave the house to get food. i have had siu wok food before and it doesnt suck, but this sucks. this sucks so bad. i have to put on pants now. real ones, not just pajama pants. i really wanted chinese food. this is unacceptable; i cannot accept this. darren wilson walks free yesterday and now this. im goign to kill myself probably"}
{"text":"Had a great Spicy sauteed beef, and hot chicken wings.  Delivered in about 25 minutes to my hotel.   I ate what I could then my 2 food ninjas (kids) polished off the rest later on.  Flavor and freshness in the veggies was evident.  Nice recommendation from the hotel staff!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but cleanliness is the problem. I got a hair in my fried rice, and for that i am not going back. Need to find another tasty chinese place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place even just a little.  It gets 2 stars because it looks clean and is quick.  The \"fried\" rice is the most uninspired fried rice ever.  It is more like soy sauced leftover rice than fried with anything.  And it is nothing but soy sauce and rice.  Not even onion... I've been a few times, because it is so close to work and really wanted to like this place - especially since Ichi Ban closed.  I can never get all white meat chicken - and I would pay extra - I don't like the dark chicken menu items due to the weird chewy pieces you almost always get.  The egg rolls are barely ok, the \"crab\" angels have no crab that I found...it is overall, meh.  I'd rather go to subway or the U-Haul café..."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here twice. Once, 12 minutes before closing time for me and my husband, and another time on a Saturday with my family. Both times the orders were 100% accurate and on time. The food is absolutely delicious and doesn't feel wet with grease or overly salty (I didn't say it wasn't, I just said it didn't feel that way....we all know the sin in chinese food). We have gotten the kung pao chicken, vegetarian lo mein, and orange chicken. All were fantastic."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mongolian beef combo and the Kung pao chicken combo. Their fried rice has no vegetables in it. It's pretty much rice with soy sauce cooked into it. There was pretty much no color to the entire order - it was all brown. The egg rolls were soggy and pretty bland. It's a lot of food for the money that you pay, but it's just not worth it because of the grease, brown color, and it all tasted the same as in - the greasy low mean tasted like the fried rice which tasted the same as the entree.  also tried the egg flower soup and it didn't keep a brothy consistency at all. It started to get thick and grease started to float to the top.   The $25 for takeout was a waste of my money. Pretty much took a few bites and could Not finish it. Should have just had a bowl of cereal for dinner or paid the extra money for Pei Wei. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"There are so many Chinese/Asian restaurants in Phoenix. Let me get right to the point: Siu Wok has delicious food! I have ordered delivery before and always like their food. Today, I had a sore throat and wanted hot & sour soup. So I went to their restaurant on Central Ave.  All I have to say is WOW! The restaurant atmosphere is similar to a cafeteria rather than a service by a waiter restaurant. But, The food was fast, hot and delicious. So if you want good Asian food but don't need all the frills of a fancy restaurant, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Siu Wok is the best in Phoenix, Inexpensive, good portions. Love this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places in Phoenix.  Food is awesome (Honey walnut shrimp is the best!)  Service is fast when eating in, Delivery is fast. Siu Wok is the only place we get Chinese food from."}
{"text":"While visiting PHX, the hotel front desk guy recommended Siu Wok.  It is quite possibly the best chinese food I've ever had.  The house special fried rice was wonderful (you can tell their wok is seasoned well) and the hot and sour soup was filled to the brim with all kinds of veggies and lots of tofu!  Delivery time quoted was right on the mark and they knew I was staying in a hotel so they even asked me if I needed a plate delivered.  Wish I lived here so I could have it all the time!"}
{"text":"The worst! icky!  I stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Ordered General Chicken \"for here.\" They brought it to my table all packaged up and when I told her I was eating \"in\" I was informed they only serve lunch all packaged up (I guess its mainly a takeout place). . The chicken was gooey with no sauce to speak of. The rice was cold and hard in 2 scoops. No flavor at all.  The broccoli was so overcooked it was no longer green and smelled like poo.  I'll never ever try again here. Definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Always super fast delivery and this is the best Chinese fast food we have had in Phoenix.  It is very consistent."}
{"text":"Quick delivery very tasty food.  Mongolian beef and sautéed spicy beef was really yummy."}
{"text":"Top marks for delivery speed. Agreeing with some other reviewers, these guys get it there in half the time or quicker than they say they will. I've only ever ordered delivery from them, and they give you a BUNCH of food and I can't really complain about any of that filler crap that you get a lot at chinese places. I may not eat all my vegetables but that's really on me -- they're delicious. This isn't the absolute best chinese I've ever had, but their prices, while not by any means a big-time bargain, are extremely commensurate with the quantity and quality of the food, and paying 25 bucks up and down including tip for two solid meals delivered in 15 minutes is really decent.  I've had their house lo mein which is very good and the shrimp with lobster sauce, which is a LITTLE heavy on the veggies, but it's very good as well. I'm a big fat guy and I get two meals out of that order. The girl that answers the phone is nice, and the question you're having a hard time understanding her say while you're giving her your credit card no. is \"expiration date?\" They save your number too which is handy.  This could honestly be five stars for food/service/price combo, but it's not, like a FIVE-STAR meal, you know? There exists better chinese in the world. But if you take it all into account, I couldn't really ask for more. This is a great place."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Friday and after waiting for good 10 minutes, none of the staff even noticed us. We didn't even get \"I'll right with you\", or maybe just a glass of water just to notice our presence. Just nothing! So after 10 minutes of waiting, we just left. I won't go back not even for a free lunch. They just don't know what to do. Alberto."}
{"text":"They are very flexible, you can customize any meal because they make it when you order it. It's a local Chinese family owned place I think.   It's good, fast Chinese take out food, compared to Panda Express and a lot of other Chinese take outs out there 4 stars for sure!  Lo Mein Noodles, Good, not too much oil accumlating at the bottom like some places. The noodles are thick and sturdy not soft and soggy  Chicken Fried Rice It seems like too much soy sauce in the fried rice but other than that it's a good dish!  Price Fair for the portion  Cleanliness Very clean"}
{"text":"A new standard for bad Chinese food.  First time. Flier on my door said \"All Dishes Cooked Fresh per Order\". Ordered luch special Teriyaki Chicken white rice instead of fried rice, dine in. Lunch special is $6.95, soda $1.50.  Steamed rice was OK. Falls apart, more like Uncle Ben's than I would like. Surprisingly very little rice is given.  Huge amount of chicken.  Cooked fresh? I waited about 2-3 minutes for my order to arrive. It was super hot...microwave hot. Places that actually cook fresh don't actually have to say it, it's obvious.  Not a single word from the person handing me the bag which is always a nice touch.  The chicken was well on its way to being jerky. I'm not saying that to be mean, or to exaggerate, I think it's accurate. The outside of each chicken chunk was hard, dry and stringy. The inside of each chunk wasn't stringy but very dry and tasteless. Obviously the meat had been cooked hours before, maybe the day before, could even have been days ago.  More of a British-Chinese fusion thing.  Teriyaki Chicken? Not even close. It's old chicken with some kind of brown sweet thin liquid poured over it and microwaved.  I rarely throw out food, a chicken gave its life for this and I shouldn't waste it...but most of this went into the can. Wish I had a dog.  The egg roll was the standard manufactured type which is fine.  The Crab Puffs were interesting. Of course there's no crab in it...or seafood of any kind. It looked and tasted like a cube of cream cheese in a fried wonton. Not exactly what I think of when I think Chinese. Maybe not exactly good, but not bad either. I wouldn't personally eat another one but these were edible.  Phoenix has some truly bad Chinese restaurants and Siu Wok is at the bottom of my list so far."}
{"text":"The past few times I have tried to call it seems that their phone is turned off. I am assuming that this business is not open anymore."}
{"text":"OMG very delicious shrimp with walnuts!  Wait to order after 5p, spend $15 and get free crab puffs! Sooo awsome. Service is always speedy, friendly and accurate. You won't be disappointed. My love feels he's had the best orange chicken ever."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese delivery in central Phoenix. Always go for the combo plates, enough for leftovers. And ask them to bring you a couple of menus to share with their friends. Everything is good, but the twice cooked pork and the tangerine chicken are wonderful. When you call they say 45 minutes, never more than 20 to my house."}
{"text":"Siu Wok is NOT closed....they are on a family vacation and will open again after 4th of July holiday.   I love their food...very good.....fried rice could be better, other than that...YUM"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. This place has been closed for over a month with a sign on the door saying \"on vacation. Be back on July 2nd.\" Well its the 6th and they aren't back. Not a great way to treat your customers who keep coming back. At the vary least leave a recorded message. It's 2015. Phones do that now."}
{"text":"i usually stay with places im familiar with and i like but i just tried out this place and i  couldnt be happier! it is the best house chicken ive ever had and i love that the combo comes w appetizers as well! i would like a bigger scoop of rice with the combo but besides that, the place was clean, very friendly and there was actually asian people that worked and cooked there :)"}
{"text":"Is this the best Chinese food I have ever had?  Nope.  But it is the best delivery of any food type I have had in Phoenix.  The minimum order is $15.  The delivery charge is $2.  The delivery area is large and the packing is thoughtful!  That's right.  I always have leftovers and these kept.  I ordered egg foo young and it was divided into its three components.  Egg patties in one box, rice in another, with meat and veggies in a tupperware!  The other impressive thing... the driver figured out my apartment complex.  When I order delivery of any variety I always explain the gate system and leave my code for the driver so I can buzz them in.  And 9 times out of ten a driver calls me and asks me to come down and get my food.  GRRRRR.  Delivery means to my door and nothing less. My door is nowhere near the gates.  Siu Wok gets it done right!  Now if only they were open at 10pm on Sundays."}
{"text":"A+ from start to finish. Ordered for delivery, person I spoke with was very patient and courteous. Delivery took about 20 minutes. Food was very generously portioned and absolutely delicious. I'm a New Yorker and I've been dying to find good Chinese food here. It wasn't just good, it was excellent. Very apparent all ingredients were fresh, and neatly presented, right down to the orange slice garnish on the chicken."}
{"text":"Siu Wok is our go-to Chinese delivery joint! Everything we order is delicious. Our favorite items include the Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and House Fried Rice - yum! They're always on time and very polite. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Want some fried rice?  A good size serving of yummy, piping hot Chinese food?   Look no further.    As my friend from Bangkok used to say, \"You like these ?  Five bucks\" .    She was talking about jeans, but it's pretty much the same thing."}
{"text":"Went here today for some take out. The people here are very nice and the food is great. They were very fast also. Prices are excellent for the lunch specials. I got a shrimp and a chicken meal and the total for both was under $20. Food was   really great, especially for the price. The shrimp dish was generous with the shrimp and they were fairly large. Chicken was excellent also. Portions were big,  had leftovers for a snack later.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so confused...I love this place but this is the 2nd time that we call for delivery and they don't answer. Are they open anymore? It's 8:30 and they're open until 9. I don't get it!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered once.  I had wonton soup, shrimp fried rice, and sesame chicken.  The Soup was very good.  Full of vegetables, beef, chicken, and shrimp.  The shrimp fried rice was great, better than I expected.  The flavor of the fried rice was very good and the shrimp were nice big shrimp.  I'd definitely order the fried rice again.  The Sesame Chicken, however, was a disappointment.  It was just... not good.  Delivery was fast, though there is a 2 dollar fee and a 15 dollar minimum purchase.  Food Quality over all was very good, I will order from them again but I'll never order the sesame chicken again."}
{"text":"The food here was awful. The worst I've had in some time. It was super salty and over cooked. I had the teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed.  Not in the food, since I never got to taste it.  No, we were disappointed in the customer service.  I ordered lunch online for myself and 2 co-workers. I received a confirmation email.  My co-workers were going to walk across the street to pick up the order.  I even called to ask how long it would take.   They spent the better part of our lunch hour waiting for food we never got because they said it was being delivered, which it never was.  Luckily they hadn't paid and they left to get our lunch somewhere else.  On top of that, the staff was rude to my friends.  We will never go back. I wouldn't even give one star but the site is making me."}
{"text":"Siu Wok is probably my favorite Chinese fast food joint in Phoenix. They were one of the only places that I knew of in the downtown area that delivered and their food isn't as reliant on being breaded and deep-fried as other cheap Chinese food joints. While I wouldn't go so far as to say this is one of the best Chinese places in the area, I do appreciate them being around. The people who work here are super friendly and they've got a killer lunch special. However, the food is a little on the greasy side-- strictly a comfort food, local version of Panda Express, but slightly better. My only major gripe-- they're not open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"So I don't know where all these people are normally getting their Chinese food but this place is GOD AWFUL and I really think the owners have paid these people who have reviewed this place with me. I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me.  I got the panflet sent to me in the mail and it actually delivers to my apartment which is rare so I figured why not? FAIL!!!! I should have taken my normal 10 minute drive up to Indian School.   First off the women answering the phone was rude but I digress. Second off this place is not cheap and I wound up paying almost 30 bucks for little portions of god awful food.  The Hot and sour soup is awful. I couldn't eat it. Who puts pork into that soup? It wasn't even spicy!!! It also smelled terrible. It looked like a mish mosh of whatever they had lying around the kitchen and then they soaked it in the leftover eggdrop soup.  It didn't contain the usual mix of chinese mushrooms that you would normally find along with that dark brown chili broth that I live for.  The fried rice was dry as a bone and the expensive 10.95 pu-pu platter was a few pieces of dry overcooked pork, 1 ghetto chicken wing that we were afraid to eat and these measly little dried shrimps.   The egg rolls were dry, tasteless and inedible.  I ordered the orange chicken and I seriously think that they pre-ordered this stuff from some ready- made food company and microwaved it because it started to make me nauseous.   And now the dumplings.....It says we were suppose to get 8 and the pictures looked good..what we got was 6 shriveled little things and I don't even want to venture with whats inside.   I am from New York and have had my share of bad and good Chinese and I know I will not get the quality of good NYC Chinese food in Phoenix but this is just bad, overpriced food, with a nasty receptionist and I will NEVER eat here again!!  Pass the Maalox please!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta admit, this is a great place for take out.  Our whole office orders from them and they are quick, yummy and cheap.  It's our go-to take out place!"}
{"text":"Best place to order delivery Chinese food in Downtown/uptown Phoenix. Super fast, always good and hot. Very consistent and friendly!    Our go to is the General Tso Chicken two times spicy, really good egg rolls and cheese puffs. I've also ordered the Orange chicken and it's really good too."}
{"text":"This place it's awesome, great menu, excellent prices, wonderful food. Highly recommended!!! I know I will get dinner there tonight!"}
{"text":"I used to get Siu Wok a lot.  Dear God do they give you a lot of food.  You also pay almost 9 dollars for a combination dinner.  So I guess they better provide some generous portions.  I usually go for a chicken, the sesame or orange.  Both are really good.  The best thing in the whole platter is the lo mein.  I didn't really like lo mein until Siu Wok's.  Less a statement about Siu Wok and more about my reluctance.  If you have self-control and can save half the combo for a lunch tomorrow or have someone to share with, Siu Wok is unbeatable when it comes to takeout."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better Chinese restaurants in the uptown/downtown central Phoenix area. Their delivery range area is quite large and the food is delicious. Portion sizes are huge too. The restaurant itself is very large and nice and clean, but was empty when I went Thursday evening an hour before close to get a take out order. I know this spot was a different Asian fusion hipster place that was only open a couple months prior to Siu Wok. So hopefully they can keep their doors open from take out and delivery."}
{"text":"These guys are no longer at their old location. They reopened in the little strip mall on Central & Thomas. It's been awhile, but worth the wait! I used to order all the time from them when I used to live down here, now only when I'm on this side of town. Went for my old fav'S, the Hot & Sour soup along with the fried Cantonese Noodles. They have not missed a beat, great as always! Now they are just in a much nicer place, an actual sit-down restaurant. Parking is still tight, but better than the old place. Definitely give them a try, u won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Decent spot for Chinese delivery. Our delivery options downtown are limited and believe it or not, pizza every day does get tiring. Delivery is usually pretty fast and the food is better than most chinese take out in the area, especially for the price.  Here's what I've had Orange chicken - pretty good. I ask them to make it spicy Sundevil pork- meh Lettuce Wraps - worth it and cheap Hot and Sour soup - standard Pepper Beef - pretty good, sauce is flavorful Tofu lo mein - I ask for it spicy and it's delicious! Crab puffs - standard Eggroll - standard"}
{"text":"This place is our go to for eating at home.  Their orange chicken and Kung pao chicken are both amazing!!"}
{"text":"Siu Wok, Siu Wok, Siu Wok...how you disappoint me. I've been going to Siu Wok for quite a long time. The previous location was exceptional. Prices were decent. Clean dining area. Occasionally I'd be stuck with the lazy cashier/waitress but I reveled in the food so I stayed. Then they make this jump to the new place.  Upon entering,  you are hit with a barrage of white walls that appear to have never been cleaned, I'm with company. We wait to be seated. The waitress sat us at a filthy table.  Oh yeah, greetings are non-existent here.The seats look like they've never been cleaned. Thus my irritation began. The waitress \"forgot\" us. We simply got up from our table to leave. I'll spend my money elsewhere. Staff need to watch that Seattle fish training video almost every employer makes you watch. You know, the one where employees act like they give a damn about something. I shall never return."}
{"text":"First visit today for lunch. Initial report looks positive, clean, nice menu, priced fairly.   CRUNCHY peanuts, GENEROUS serving if ice tea, TASTY egg roll, chicken, peppers and celery are RIGHT ON.  HAPPY !!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here once or twice a week when I worked across the street, because let's face it, there's seriously nothing else worth eating within walking distance of there.  It's pretty standard Chinese take-out fare.  Great prices, good portions, OK food... Nothing wrong with that.  The House Chicken is full of win.  I've tried a couple other things on the menu, but those delicious bits of sauce-covered chicken became my staple there for awhile."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and the order came quicker than expected. With the order we had the Cantonese noodles, orange chicken, and general tsos. The noodles was thin and savory. It had a mix of vegetables, chicken, beef, and shrimp. Best chinese delivery ordered so far. Will be calling for another order again soon."}
{"text":"Friendly people,  customer service oriented and really good food! Had my order ready for pickup in 15 minutes and also deliver.  We've tried many dishes and haven't been disappointed yet!  Its a go-to restaurant for the whole family.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last weekend after friends told us Siu Wok was their go to Chinese takeout spot.  My gut tells me they should have stayed in a smaller space and focused mostly on takeout and delivery.  Their new restaurant is huge and was not very crowded when we stopped in.  My pork with snap peas was quite good, but my husband didn't feel well after eating the shrimp fried rice.  Probably won't be back based on his experience!"}
{"text":"I like their fried rice a little but why must I pay an extra dollar for bean sprouts which are a normal part of fried rice? Give us sirracha sauce, chili oil is good in soup only!  I don't like that chili paste with the seeds in it,  I want to still feel good about your restaurant hours later,  those seeds can ruin a good experience later!  I just telling like it is,  you know aobut those seeds or you will learn. The tangerine beef isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"UM!Yeah so I was raised really poor and ghetto pretty much know the hell outta good food.....This rocked ars! yummers yo! I mean if we'd have less critics in our city and more soul Shyt than we'd have some convo... unfortunately we do not. however, after surpassing the yuppie comments I decided to add my two cents..."}
{"text":"A-OK!!  I've enjoyed take-out from Siu Wok four times now and haven't been disappointed. Very inexpensive for the amount of food you get. I have created 3 meals from one lunch special. The Pepper Steak was really yummy and perfectly spicy. The Kung Pao Steak was quite good as well as the Szechuan Chicken. (I'm noticing a spicy trend here).   The lunch specials are served with fried rice, an egg roll and (2) crab puffs. The only thing that annoyed me was the \"crab\" puffs. OK,  not only is there NO crab in them, there isn't even a hint of \"Krab\" in them.... you dig?? Call them what they are...... cream cheese puffs, thank you. I'll eat them anyway..... no need for deception.   Yesterday I had the Teriyaki Chicken for lunch. I questioned it immediately because it looked *interesting*. I actually joked to my lunch date about what I was eating and that I didn't believe it was chicken at all but in fact the victim of some \"ghetto backyard, dove massacre\"... alas I was wrong. I'm just not used to eating only dark meat chicken and let me tell you, it was fucking delicious.   In closing: good cheap eats cream cheese treats bomb dark meats  now if only they had crushed ice....."}
{"text":"I finally ate all the food I got from Siu Wok the other day and want to give it more stars.  Everything really was delicious.  I don't know if I'll ever know what \"authentic\" chinese food is supposed to taste like but as far as what I consider to be Chinese food, it was all top notch.  Exceeded my expectations for an Arizona Downtown Chinese delivery joint.  I'll be ordering from them again very soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for dinner. I had the shrimp fried rice and crab Rangoons. They were both okay, not terrible, but not exceptionally flavorful. I ordered for pickup and it was ready within 10 minutes, which was great. The inside of the restaurant was clean and modern. I would recommend if you need something quick on a lazy weeknight."}
{"text":"WOW.  i just ordered dinner for myself and my two little kids.  the guy was AN HOUR LATE and i tried to call several times and got the busy signal each time.  when i told the delivery guy i didn't want it anymore because i had already made a different dinner for my kids, he said, \"ok, that's fine\". UNBELIEVABLE.  WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Love this place! I work next door for UHaul and I know a lot of us eat here and we love it! I've had the orange chicken lunch special the sweet and sour chicken and both are very good and the portions are huge. Staff is always very friendly and my food is always ready within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I have been here before when it was north of Osborne and recall that it was about 3 stars then...Today, not so much.  I don't know where all these people giving this place 5 stars came from or what their taste buds are like, but at the highest I would say 3, that being on it's best day.  I would rather go to Panda for the price.  I'm not a food snob, so all I can say is give it a try, but don't go in with high hopes.  Also, the parking lot is shared with Subway, Lenny's, IchiBan and Panera, so needless to say, there isn't much parking."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery... curry beef was amazing! Large portions for the money!"}
{"text":"I was spoiled by Chinese food while living in England and since moving back to AZ have been looking for a quality local, cheap and YUMMY place nearby.  The idea of Panda Express makes me gag.  Most other cheapish Chinese restaurants nearby don't use quality meats and make no effort at all with their food.  Siu Wok is my absolutely favorite 'fast food style' Chinese place now.  It's super convenient for me at the office (just up the road) and I always have leftovers for the next day too.  Hands down, what sold me on this place, was their amazing won tons.  Silly thing, right?  These are a meal in themselves stuffed with all white meat chicken and never dripping in grease despite being deep fried.  I've had a few of their beef dishes which were all very good, but I really LOVE their cashew chicken.  It's all white meat chicken as well and of good quality - no tough or unexplainable bits.  The veggies are never overcooked and their sauces aren't overpowering - just add nice flavor and consistency over the rice.  I could literally eat here multiple times a week and have been regularly turning colleagues on to the place.  If only they were closer to my house out on the west side...I would love them even more.  Don't expect glamour from this place though.  This is a minimal and somewhat stereotypical joint.  I'm not going in for the decor though, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest!"}
{"text":"Chinese delivery! It was good and they deliver usually pretty quick. I dont like that their not open sundays."}
{"text":"Not very good. I would only eat here if someone else was buying it, and I would probably make a sandwich before I ate."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix! Consistently delicious and super friendly people. Take out or eat jn, It's always fresh! Shrimp with garlic sauce or the orange chicken are my go to."}
{"text":"We used to order delivery from Siu Wok all the time. Quick arrival (sometimes within 15 minutes)! The food was always average-good which works when you don't want to get off the couch.   Received Spring Rolls instead of Egg Rolls twice. On third order, I made sure to clarify and was told they no longer offer them. Why didn't they tell us before? A shame, because the egg rolls were one of the better items.   Delivery men have always been SO warm and friendly.    -fried rice is good  -house chicken is hit or miss, sometimes hot and crispy...sometimes soggy and chewy.  -walnut shrimp serving size isn't worth the cost. Or flavor."}
{"text":"Yummy food ! You would think superman delivered  our food ..super fast! Order was right on target!"}
{"text":"***Siu Wok's customer service policy is that no once cares, because management doesn't want to speak with their customers much less address concerns.  We spend an average of $45 a week on what was our favorite Chinese restaurant delivery in town... lately, we have had issues with the customer service. One such man, Alonzo, didn't feel that it was important to A) know what the menu items were to begin with, and B) what sauces came with the menu items, as we attempted to order extra sauce, which we were charged for but never received. Upon a return call to advise that we not only never received said sauce, but received chili sauce, which made NO sense...he proceeded to argue, to speak over me and condescend in a manner that was inappropriate in every imaginable customer service scenario. I asked to speak with the manager only to be told he was 'out on a delivery', and I asked for a return call when he was finished. He asked for my number, to which I replied, \"You have my number, you repeat it to me every time I call\"... he then proceeded to insist he didn't, so I gave him the #, which he repeated back to me incorrectly. Never got a call back, the next day I called again, and was told that the manager not only wasn't there, but that it was company policy that the manager will not speak with customers. Bullshit. It sounds petty, but I will not do business with a restaurant who has a policy that disregards customer service as unimportant."}
{"text":"Use to work there and owner was disrespectful and sexual harrasment was going on to  the female employees owner treats employees bad and talks down and uses the language barrier as a excuse and he does speak English and acts like he don't when confronted about his actions"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food available in midtown PHX, and their delivery is always timely."}
{"text":"I was able to order delivery (thank you) and took the time to order for seven people, for a rather substantive bill. I am glad I ordered the beef soup, otherwise nothing would have been edible. I was told upon ordering that it would take about 40 minutes for delivery, they were at my place in 15, so kudos there. The delivery person was extremely rude (not sure why) and heckled me about the tip amount - I tip based on service and this fellow was very rude. We tried to use the coupon we received before, but I was told that we would need to wait until after 5pm for the coupon (?) The food was worse than all you can eat buffet food, and I would dare say some of the worst tasting I have ever had at any Chinese food eatery in the Valley. The portions were substantive, but the food appeared to have been reheated or stale. The soup was the only saving grace for my order, but we couldn't split it in seven, so we ended up going to China Village instead. We tried to feed some of the food to the neighbor's two dogs, but they wouldn't touch it. I learned an expensive lesson."}
{"text":"Great place to get Chinese food. Want to add that I left my wallet there but didn't discover it was missing till the next day. I went back and they still had it all in tack. I am soooo grateful that the girl was so honest!"}
{"text":"Siu Wok is no joke the best place to get REAL chinese food in downtown Phx. Must try Lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Siu Wok has been a favorite for quite some time.  Sadly, today's experience knocked them off the list.  My co-workers and I decided we needed a tasty meal today so we placed a delivery order through Siu Wok.  We were happy when the meal arrived much sooner than the 45-minute delivery estimate.  Our food was hot and smelled delicious.  We were all enjoying our food when one co-worker made a stomach-turning discovery: a dead fly in her food.  We all immediately stopped eating, repulsed by the large fly nestled up to a sliced carrot.  I immediately called Siu Wok to complain and spoke with Jennifer.  I told her what happened and asked for a refund on the entire order.  She said she could refund the contaminated meal but would have to speak with the manager for authorization on the other two.  She called back a few minutes later and said she was only given permission to refund the $7.95 for the extra-protein meal.  She seemed to understand why I was disappointed but said her hands were tied.  I asked her to relay to management that I was very disappointed in his lack of attention to the matter and that Siu Wok had just lost a considerable amount of business, as our office frequently places orders there.  Instead of Siu Wok being out $23.44, they have lost an office full of customers and gained a negative Yelp review.  Doesn't the fly look delicious??"}
{"text":"I like this place! Everything I've had from there has been delivery or takeout. It's consistent it's good and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and combos.  Their shrimp combos are great and the prices are always spot on.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Flier was put on our door. Delivery came really quick and the food was still warm! Tasted pretty good going down but tasted horrible coming back up. This restaurant gave my boyfriend and I the worst food poisoning of our livesssssss!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you gave a bad review to a CHINESE restaurant but ate the TERIYAKI, YOU are a moron. I hope you sit on a wet, urine soaked towel and it gets you JUUUSSTTT wet enough to be uncomforable all day."}
{"text":"Lunch Special under $8.50 nice - Could have gone to Safeway freezer section, bought the items and it would have tasted the same.  As it was fairly empty I heard no noise in the kitchen so my plate, brought out in 2 min was under a warming light and tasted as such."}
{"text":"I stopped at random for lunch and a big mistake.   I was seated and had to ask for a server.    I finally got a server and received cold fried rice and a burnt egg roll.  I also had to ask a few times for a beverage after being served my food.    I will not return."}
{"text":"So there aren't many Chinese take out places that really that great and the hard ones are either hard to find or else too far. We got Chinese take out tonight from Sui Wok and hands down, it was a very tasteful meal! Love the quality of food and how fast their delivery was! Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of delivery chinese food in Phoenix and in Scottsdale and I have to say, this place really impressed me.  I usually dread spending the amount of money I usually spend only to get ALMOST mediocre food.  I ordered the moo shoo chicken from this place and it was fantastic!  The war won ton soup was also very good and the noodles are amazing.  A spring roll came with the combo meal as did 3 crab puffs...minus the crab.  They were delicious as well.  You get A LOT of food for the money and it is MUCH better than other delivery chinese around the valley.  If you're in the area and looking for a chinese fix, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me with their delicious food. Yes it sucks they are closed on Sundays, however I make sure to get in there some other day for sure. I've loved everything I've had, lemon chicken, orange chicken, mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, crab puffs, fried rice, and chicken lo mein. Can't go wrong in this place, at least not that I've experienced. It is very small and dated, but the food will impress. The prices are also cheap for the amount of food and quality of everything on the plate. Lemon chicken is my favorite thing, the sauce is a light sweet coating on the well fried chicken."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food place in Phoenix  (that I have tried so far ) their food is good, the service is fast and with a smile. The amount of food you get and for the price is INSANE! I am a fan and will be going back again."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Chinese food restaurant in Phoenix. I tend to stick with the Mongolian beef and crab rangoon, both of which are phenomenal. I have had other dishes here and have yet to not enjoy it. They are super convenient and are super punctual with their deliveries. A must try if you enjoy Chinese food."}
{"text":"Sui Wok Chinese Food, (next door to FEZ on Central) is really good! ....Don't let the smallness of the size of the place , nor the bright flouresant lights fool you.... I was surprisingly impressed with the food.  :)"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with I place an order over the phone at 11:15amdjoodr  They guy took my order and said is going take 45 to 60 minutes.  I called them back at 12:20 , they said driver is out . Just be patient , he would be in few minutes Then we call back again at 12:40  He said driver would not come in 30 minutes . Or they can cancel my order without charge !  Would you imagining , we ordered food because we are hungry  Wait for 1 and half hour , then you said you can cancel your your without a charge !"}
{"text":"I liked this place in the beginning I've ordered from here numerous times and the quality and effort they put into the food seems to just get worse and worse. I will not be eating here anymore since they messed up my order so bad now. Messed up on both of the combination plates and completely gave us something else that we didn't order. The food was good not it's just another crappy quality Chinese take out"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food, delicious but doesn't really have the wow factor. When I'm in the area for training it is my go to place when I absolutely cannot decide on something. The area is a bit crowded during the lunch hour, other times aren't so bad. It was a bit difficult to find the first time I decided to try it..but it's not hidden underground, you just have to be alert. It's an old shop, a little more tidiness would be nice but the employees are always very nice. Regular menu items for an affordable price."}
{"text":"I was hungry and looking for some delivery Chinese. The girl who answered the phone was sweet and explained my options well. She told me I would have my delivery in about 30 minutes and it got here in about 15 minutes. When the food got here, it was so fresh and hot that I had to give it a few minutes before I could start eating eat. Portions are HUGE.   I had:  Bean Curd Family Style (with Veggie) - I give it 3 stars. Nice flavor with a ton of tofu. Only problem? Not enough vegetables! As much as I love tofu and brown sauce I also order the dish for the vegetables.  Vegetable Bean Curd Soup - I give it 5 stars. I added some white rice (that came with my entree) and a dash of soy sauce. It was easily my favorite part of the meal.  Vegetable Fried Rice -I give it 3 stars. I was pretty full by the time I had some of this. I will eat it for lunch tomorrow but the flavor didn't instantly jump at me. Still nice though.  Would I recommend this place?   YES  Will I be a repeat customer?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"And now ladies and gentlemen, the category tonight: Things that make Siu-Wok A-OK in my book.  Here we go....  #10 - I can actually understand the people that answer the phone #9 - The sweet burn on my tongue after eating a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken #8 - The lack of lasting gastral repercussions from eating said Kung Pao Chicken #7 - The friggin huge area to which they will deliver, for a minimal $2 charge (beware their website says it's a buck-fifty, but the gas crunch is effecting everyone) #6 - The pork fried rice that is literally one part rice mixed with one part tender / tasty pork #5 - The place is actually clean #4 - The coupons attached to the menus that they send to my home at regular intervals #3 -  I can call in an order, hop in my car to pick it up, and be back watching quality reality programming within 15 minutes #2 - They have Mr. Pibb on tap  And the number 1 thing that makes Siu-Wok A-OK in my book... Eight... yes count 'em, eight, yummy soups that they will deliver to my door when I just can't bring myself to change out of my pajamas!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I call the restaurant for take out, they never pick up the phone! The foods great and they deliver... If you can get ahold of anyone there!!! I've called 6 times today... During business hours... NO ANSWER!"}
{"text":"This place got me through my pregnancy 6 years ago and to this day, they still are amazing!  The chicken fried rice is the best! I could seriously eat it as a meal alone! Their honey walnut shrimp is delicious (great portions, perfectly cooked) and they've let me order teriyaki beef too which is amazing. Their orange chicken and broccoli beef also do not disappoint! We order them all the time at Phoenix Comicon and to our home.   I've got to go, time to get me some of their chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"This is the Chinese takeout downtown residents have been waiting for.   After so many bad experiences elsewhere, I must say...this is the one.   I haven't run into something I didn't like. The fried rice is top notch, and both veggie sides and chicken entrees are bomb. Lunch specials might take 10-15 minutes to prepare, but they're made RIGHT.   And if you want to dine in, there's TONS of space as well.   If you need something reliable, look no further than Siu."}
{"text":"If your looking for great Chinese food for cheap and in a hurry this place will kick Panda Express's ass.  The skinny I found this place about 8-9 years ago and have been a fan this place since, it has the best orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp I have ever had. Now I have never actually sat and ate here but I always take my order to go or delivery which is insane how far they go. The orange chicken has plenty of sauce but the chicken is always crispy if you get the combo plate they will add 2 crab puffs egg roll and rice and noodles which are also to die for if you go after 5pm and spend 15$+ they will throw in free crab puffs with coupon and coupon is in menu so just pick one up. The girls are always sweet in front area and are always so quick.  The bad  Once the delivery driver was pretty aggressive with the tip he made sure to let me know twice where the tip line was on my check even after I told him I had cash for tip. Another time they got my order wrong and did not give me combo plate but manager made it up by offering free crab puffs next time which I didn't take advantage of as I always use that coupon but even then I wasn't too bummed out this place rocks. They also have gone on month long vacations and have closed for that long which drove us insane lol. Overall this place is one of my favorite spots and they maybe yours too if you give them a shot."}
{"text":"been here a few times now. The place feels like a dive which usually means awesome food. it was good food but super fried and kinda greasy so if your gut can take it and are in the mood, go for it. the flavor across 3 visits has been good but not awesome. the staff have been nice and the place seems clean. if you are short on time this is actually a good spot. not too busy. the best part is portion size. for what you pay, you get a LOT."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. I've been eating here for 7 years, since before they got their new location and they have been consistently good that entire time."}
{"text":"I'm giving Siu Wok 4 stars not because it's a gourmet restaurant but because the entire menu (as much as possible) is convertible to vegetarian.  I ordered the Szechuan chicken dish but they substituted the chicken for steamed tofu.  Fried tofu is also available.  I really appreciated this flexibility.  The food was great, spicy and plentiful!  Will def be coming back here."}
{"text":"Chinese delivery in central Phoenix! Wow it almost feels like a real city.  Almost!  The dishes are all Americanized Chinese style as you might find in many family style restaurants in NY and Cali. I suspect most people in China wouldn't recognize any of these dishes. But no worries - it's actually good in a Chinese delivery kind of way.   I've had fried rice, a couple shrimp dishes, and also beef and pork. All were very tasty. The shrimp were large, plentiful, and tasted very good. The large egg drop soup earned it's moniker. It's actually large.  It's the only game in town in CenPho for Chinese delivery. I'm sure they are doing a brisk business!  I've never been inside. I have no idea what it's like. I'm almost scared to find out!  Their delivery area is      northern 43rd      40th ave       st.    Buckeye  and the delivery fee is only $1.50! I suspect that will change."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY recommend the cantonese pan fried noodles! I personally love their salt n pepper shrimp, and they have really fast delivery. Good thing I'm only in the office rarely otherwise I'd order here Monday thru Friday!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of yours since you relocated to your current location: Central Avenue and Roanoke. Lately, however, I've become VERY disillusioned with your products and your service.  Case in point: soup orders and egg rolls. Carry-out soup orders, large or small, are now being consistently \"shorted,\" i.e., less product is in the containers; the containers are now noticeably underfilled, compared to previous purchases. And since you have transitioned from eggrolls with chicken to strictly vegetable eggrolls, the size of each eggroll is substantially smaller than before, though the price remains the same at $1.50 each. Half-size really should translate into half-price, i.e., 75 cents per eggroll.  As for your service, chaos seems to have descended on your ordering counter. Yesterday (March 20), orders were taking so long to fill that three customers were inquiring as to refunds. One of those three customers was told that the order was \"on delivery,\" though the customer said she had not requested delivery. One customer had to suffer through a lost lunch hour because her order was not \"punched into\" the front-counter computer.  I'd REALLY like to remain your customer...and will patronize you in the short term to see if any of the above-mentioned issues are addressed. If they're not, well...I'll simply exercise my option to purchase lunch elsewhere. Likely, other current customers will walk away too."}
{"text":"this place rules, just got delivery crazy fast and food was excellent."}

{"text":"I've tried this place a few times and the foods alright. Just your average chinese place .. nothing to brag about!"}
{"text":"They are open.  Best Chinese delivery in N central Phoenix.  Their Mongolian beef is good with green onions.  My favorite dish is the salt/pepper shrimp.  It uses peeled shrimp in a light sauce with jalapenos/onions."}
{"text":"One of the only Chinese places I like in the valley. I always go with the #12 lunch combo, the chicken and broccoli. It is delicious and the spring rolls are great too. I highly recommend Siu Wok if you're looking for a Chinese fix during lunch."}
{"text":"so my girlfriend HATES chinese and I LOVE it. i of course am that one that suffers due to an insufficient intake of chinese food. BUT i did my gilfriend a huge favor and she in turn bought me dinner, and wanted to give this place a shot, mostly because we were tired and didn't want to go anywhere and they deliver (!!!!!!!!).   well, my extremely picky chinese-food hating girlfriend actually dug the meal. she ordered the lemon chicken (sauce on the side, extra lemon wedges) and white rice, and i got the szchewaun chicken combo with lo mein, fried rice, crab puff, and egg roll. my other friend who was with us went with the kung pao chicken combo. all three were equally amazing. well, I didn't too much care for the dry \"lemon\" chicken that my gf ordered, but she is hella picky and they made it just how she likes it so she was happy with hers. I was very satisfied with my spicy szchewaun chicken that came with zucchini, peppers, and water chestnuts, and was even more impressed by the delicious lo mein on the side. rice is rice, it was good.  great price and great food. definitely my go to chinese place now. and i'm even more excited that i'll be able to eat it more often now that they've satisfied a previous chinese food hater. yay siu wok!"}
{"text":"Love it! Their combo specials are more than enough food to share. Plus they deliver! Speedy and friendly service."}
{"text":"The third in an ongoing series of restaurants I've actually never set foot in.  Siu Wok has become a favorite of my colleagues and I as of late. They offer the standard items you'd find at any Chinese restaurant and that's about it. They do it and do it well. Plus they deliver ($15 minimum order), which is of the utmost important when shackled to a workstation 8 hours a day or more. If you can get an order pulled together by 3pm, the offering of lunch combo specials can't be beat. 25 entrees with a side of rice, an eggroll and 2 crab puffs, most combos costing $5.95.  One of my favorite dishes is the Pork Chop Suey (not Suey made with Pork Chops, but Chop Suey made with Pork). The veggies are fresh and plentiful and make for great leftovers later in my shift or the next day.  I came very close to actually going into Siu Wok once, but it was Sunday and they were closed. Now I know..."}
{"text":"As I opened my apartment door, a menu fluttered to the floor, featuring the standard washed-out pictures of what I lovingly call \"shitty Chinese\" favorites--food that is delicious in its own right, but not worthy of the descriptor \"Chinese.\" We tried Siu Wok the very next day :)  We were hungry when we ordered so we got a large hot&sour soup, large west lake beef soup, large General Tso's chicken, and dinner combo sauteed spicy beef for two. These items ended up feeding us for 7 meals (3.5 each), and we are pretty big eaters. The portions are more than generous, and satisfying. However, the hot&sour soup that my s/o ordered had shrimp in it, and he doesn't eat seafood, so I ended up drinking it the next day. Also, although the combo has some nice variety, the fried rice wasn't very good and I don't like the crab rangoons, so I think next time I'll just stick with the big container of steamed white rice. Yum.  Delivery did take about an hour (and we didn't get an estimate (that we could tell) for when the food would be delivered) but they do take credit cards, and you can tip on the credit card too! This is probably going to be our go-to shitty Chinese delivery place from here on out :)"}
{"text":"Where do I been.  I called in a to-go order and had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie the manager.  For a manager, Ronnie was rude and has very poor customer service skills.  We over looked her behavior and decided to order anyway because we had received good service in the past and everyone is entitled to a bad day.   To our surprise some of the order was wrong.   The pork noodle soup came with chicken instead of pork.  Not what we ordered but we could live with other white meat.    We also ordered Kung Pao Chicken one with peanuts and one without (the one supposedly without nuts was clearly marked \"NO PEANUTS\").  Thank God the person that she was sharing the Kung Pao Chicken with who is deathly allergic to nuts did not fix her plate first (Peanut allergies can be life threatening).    We called Siu Wok to complain, I again had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie and her poor customer service skill.  First she said there was no way the Kung Pao Chicken had peanuts because they where cooked in two different pans. This of course was not the case.   Ronnie did not offer any solutions.  I had to request she replace our order with the correct food.  Sadly, when the delivery guy came back with our corrected order his attitude was just as bad as Ronnie's.  I asked to speak with Ronnie's manager.  I am still waiting on that call.    All I have to say is eating at Sui Woks can be deadly.  We will never order from there again."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and I love chinese food, but first impression of taste was really not to be desired for, I was so disappointed.  It was bland, there fried rice was gross, sorry.  I ordered there House Chicken, and I love to to try different house chicken from different restaurants, and this is far the worst I've ever had, I just took 2 bites and that was it.  I couldn't bare it.  Don't get me wrong, it was edible but not for my taste buds.  I only enjoyed there crab puffs that came with it."}
{"text":"The food here is great if you get the large portion it comes with an eggroll, 2 crab puffs, rice, and noodles. I was sad when this place closed and very happy when they opened at their new location."}
{"text":"Writing based on the orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, and sesame chicken - my fave.  Proteins are great but are on the greasy side but hey its chinese food, rice and noodles are great.  You get a full eggroll for their lunch special.  Crap wontons are delish.  So bad but so good."}
{"text":"Pretty standard American Chinese food. I did pickup and had the sesame chicken combo and crispy wontons. The food portions are good with the combo! Comes with egg roll and crab puffs, rice and noodles, and the entree."}
{"text":"Great cheap takeout! I had the moo shu pork and it was a bit saucy but delicious!  I'll definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I was a long time take out customer at their old location.  I decided to dine-in on a whim, just to see how it is.  I'm probably going to continue to call in and pick up to go.  While the food is still just as good, the service is very slow and server not easy to understand.  I ordered a Coke with my meal and the glass was crammed full of ice and the soda was flat. No biggy, I just ordered another, but was told no refills without additional charge.  Ok, so I ordered water.  Interestingly enough, the water had very little ice...almost melted before it reached the table.  The new dining room is large, more updated than the old location. And looks like they will have a full bar soon. Hopefully in time, the service will improve and soda refills will not be extra  charge. If so, order no ice! This is a good place for regular comfort Chinese food.   It always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I had lived within walking distance of this establishment for nearly a year before I had tried it. It's location in a strip mall and outward appearance were part of it, as well as the spotty Yelp reviews. Finally, after being discouraged with several of the other nearby Chinese food establishments, I decided to give it a go. I decided that I would pick it up, just so I could see how the place was inside before jumping in. Inside its very clean, and most of the furnishings look pretty well kept. Surprised by a bar area, but didn't investigate because the task at hand was getting food and returning home to my puppy. Ordered beef fried rice and General Tso's chicken large plate, which came out pretty quickly. I returned home and dove in, and I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed at all. Portion size is massive, food is good solid middle of the road Chinese food. Definitely an upgrade from Panda and in my opinion, far better than the other local Chinese fares. I have since ordered delivery and over the phone and still continue to be satisfied with everything I have ordered. My fiancee gets some type of curry chicken that she enjoys and I haven't varied from my beloved General Tso's chicken. Glad that I gave this place a shot, and hope this review encourages others to do so as well if they are on the fence."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken with black bean sauce and beef with broccoli. They were both fantastic, but the won ton soup was delightful.  Food was tasty and not too salty. Delivery time was a little longer than promised and customer service left something to be desired, but overall a good choice for local chinese delivery."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are a good price, the deliver in the downtown area, which makes it easy for my work. the good is just alright. I have ordered form her twice, and was not impressed. But my coworkers and I have not found another Chinese place that delivers to downtown phoenix. I have gotten the chicken vegetables which had this weird texture sauce with it and the chicken lo mien was alright."}
{"text":"I've been to the old location 15-20 times. It was always a cheap and reliable but not amazing neighborhood Chinese restaurant. I thought they went out of business but someone told me they moved. So I dropped by the new location today for lunch.  It's much bigger inside than the old restaurant. There is no counter to order from, it's now full table service. I ordered a coke and a sweet and sour pork lunch combo. The prices have increased a little and there is no longer free refills. So I paid $2 for a cup full of ice and 6-7 ounces of coke. That's gouging. I know what coke syrup costs.   Most unfortunately, the food was quite bad.   The modest portion of fried rice was barely warm. The bits of egg were dark yellow and hard. I bet it was cooked a few hours ago and became dried out. The pork was full of gristle. About half of the pieces were just plain inedible unless it was supposed to taste like pig's feet. It was like chewing on cartilage and fat. The egg roll was crispy on the outside, but the inside vegetables were mushy. The frozen aisle of Costco has better egg rolls.   I was so disappointed with my meal. I ordered off a menu, but it tasted worse than a low tier buffet. It's a shame, because I used to like Siu Wok, but they are skimping on the quality of the food. The old location's food tasted considerably better. If they keep serving food like this, they will go out of business. I won't go back. The quality to price ratio is off."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here with my friend John, and I have to agree with him that 4 stars is a good rating for them. I like the fact that they are very accommodating to vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu, and they will replace the meat with either crispy or boiled tofu. The portions are also huge! I could not finish my dish. It was totally worth the money,  it is a clean restaurant,  and very inexpensive too.  Not the most authentic Chinese food out there, but for the price and the amount of food that you get it is excellent.  It is also close to the light rail, so that is a big plus."}
{"text":"I'm catching up on reviews -- finally! It has been far too long.  I used to go to this building for SoChu House, one of the famous (or, perhaps to some locals, infamous) Johnny Chu's restaurants. I was a fan ever since I first visited Fate many years ago, back when downtown Phoenix was a very different place, and before it eventually became Bliss/ReBar (and before Fate even added the bar side of things next door.) As with many things downtown, they sometimes change rapidly. When it became Siu Wok, I never really paid much attention -- a very different type of restaurant, after all.  However, upon moving into our new place downtown late last year, we suddenly had a craving for Chinese food, but we were far too lazy after moving in to go out anywhere (or to cook!) We checked out places online and noticed that Siu Wok delivers. We rarely order anything for delivery, but we figured we'd check it out.   We found out that they offer extremely reasonable prices for dinner plates/combos that feature 2 cream cheese puffs, an egg roll, a sizeable entree, fried rice, AND lo mein. We have since ordered many other times, and the total for 2 of these large meals plus delivery and tax comes out to about $25. Bonus: it's pretty delicious, too! While I wouldn't say it's anything spectacular, we've tried about half of their menu of entrees by now with no issues whatsoever. The only times I didn't like anything were when I just didn't like certain ingredients due to personal taste, but I love trying new things :)  They are always friendly, and they often deliver much faster than expected. They usually quote us at 45-60 minutes for delivery, but I don't think we've ever really waited more than 30 minutes. This is always a welcome thing when one is starving and lazy. :)  I'm giving them 5 stars not because the food will necessarily blow you away, but because we've ordered from them many times and it has consistently been good every time. The reasonable prices and fast delivery are certainly bonuses, on top of the food being quite delicious. Highly recommended for a solid and affordable experience!"}
{"text":"Just had my second lunch special from Siu Wok. The General's Chicken is the best version of General's Chicken in the midtown Phoenix area. The lunch special was $9 and came with two wontons and am eggroll. Pretty good deal for a lot of food."}
{"text":"We ordered the kung pao chicken and general tso's chicken and both enjoyed our dish (neither were spicy so ask them to kick it up a notch if you like it hot!). The dinner portion was serviced with an egg roll, two crab puffs, chicken lo mein and fried rice. It is rare to see chicken in a side dish like that but the lo mein and fried rice were probably my favorite part of the dish. I really enjoyed the egg roll. The crab puffs were really more cream cheese won tons both still tasty. The dinner entrees start at $7.45 but you get a good amount of food. The service was good and the new location is really nice. If you only ever ordered out from here before I suggest you come by and check out the changes. I would come back to this location for take-out or dine-in."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food we have ever had. They put a flyer on our door so we thought we'd give them a try. Wish we hadn't. We had General Tsao chicken which was ok but not great. It went down hill from there. The house lo mein was barely tolerable and neither of us could eat the twice cooked pork it was so bad. We threw it out. The whole meal was a waste of money."}
{"text":"This is just about a weekly stop for me now, and I can't see any good reason not to give them 5 stars. The food is always fresh, always a generous portion, and always made quickly.  I'm always pleased with the HUGE pieces of meat they have in their dishes and the freshness of their vegetables.  Aside from that one disappointing sweet and sour pork order, I've gotten nothing but gems from Siu Wok.  Best in the area."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the actual restaurant since we are always picking up the food to go but we love it and it's prepared so quickly! They're always nice over the phone and give good suggestions but our favorites are the lunch specials, which come with 2 cream cheese wontons and an egg roll. We usually get chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein and orange chicken. All great and our go tos!"}
{"text":"SALTY!  They serve reasonably priced, traditional Chinese food. Unfortunately, every single dish that we have tried is over-salted. You can't even ask for \"no salt\" because they seem to use the same brown sauce for everything. Strangely, even the shrimp with lobster sauce is in that ubiquitous brown sauce.  Sadly for me, my father-in-law actually likes this place. He finds it similar to restaurants he knew in Long Island."}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves something to be desired. I understand its new but they need to work on the flow. It's very cafeteria-like. The food was okay but not quite worth the couple extra dollars they charge compared to other Chinese Restaurants.   Now I will say that overall I enjoyed my time at Siu Wok so definitely stop in and try it.   We had the General Tso's combo. The Lo Mein was a bit too greasy, and the fried rice & egg roll were also a bit too oily. Maybe something to work on.  The General Tso's was crispy which was nice but not quite spicy enough for my taste. I will ask them to kick it up next time.   My favorite part (aside from the lovely Jasmine Tea) was the crab puffs. Better than many other restaurants. The wait staff were very nice and attentive. Which is great!  This place has the opportunity to be great and I hope they can follow through. Then I can change my review some other time."}
{"text":"5 minutes past 3, and sorry, no lunch menu for us.  That's ok, although the only reason we were late was an accident where we tried crossing the street -in front of the business.  Sometimes it doesn't hurt to have a little leniency.  Anyways, the waitress was great, the food, decent, although not mind blowing.  Might try it again - for lunch - EARLY!"}
{"text":"I don't get what people are complaining about. I love Siu Wok. It's fast, it's good and it's consistent. What else are you looking for in a quick takee-outee place? Just eat your Chinese food, show off by using your chopsticks and enjoy your damn meal. Jesus. Update* Writing this review just made me order Siu Wok for dinner Haha"}
{"text":"I love it! The best fried rice I have had in a long time! They are nice enough to make me rice without eggs! Their lunch specials are a great deal! I usually have enough left over for lunch the next day. Most employees are friendly and they are really fast at getting your food out, it is served in togo containers, which is a great idea!"}
{"text":"I honestly love eating food from this restaurant but when it comes to delivery, I'm pretty disappointed. I've ordered delivery twice and both times, my order wasn't correct. The first time, I was delivered something that wasn't mine. Instead of two orders of shrimp fried rice , I got two orders of spicy fried rice which is what I didn't ask for over the phone. The second time, I ordered through Postmates cause I thought \"they can't screw this up, it's in print.\" I ordered a shrimp fried rice & a shrimp low mein. The shrimp fried rice came in fine but my low mein had no shrimp, at all. I'm very disappointed with this place because it's my go-to Chinese spot."}
{"text":"I Ordered delivery this eve.  1) 2 egg rolls 2) Wor wonton soup 3) kung pow chicken  Rate- Meh  The egg rolls were the best thing! Can't really go wrong Wor wonton soup and kung pow chicken were lacking big time in the flavor department. I had to add salt, pepper, and cayenne to the kung pow. The wor wonton i added ginger seasoning.   If your hungry and tipsy this place would prob be okay. I called in at 8:20 on a friday... they delivered fast."}
{"text":"Delivery was in order and because pizza has been my go to for the past couple deliveries I decided Chinese Food was in righteous.   I have checked a couple other Chinese restaurants in the area and haven't found my ideal take out / delivery niche. Well... I found it. I really like how this place has Dinner Combinations where as many other Chinese Restaurants often have only Lunch Specials, all dinner options are made for sharing.  We decided to share but still utilize the combination. Each combination came with an egg roll (standard), fried rice (standard), Crab Wontons (cheesy good), and Chicken Lo Mein (excellent). The entrees we chose were Teriyaki Chicken (good), Mongolian Beef (standard), and Tangerine Chicken (Awesome!).   I will be ordering from here again. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone.   **make sure to order WHITE MEAT for the extra dollar.**"}
{"text":"Service was attentive. Food came out very fast. Food was pretty standard but tasty. Good portion sizes. Atmosphere wasn't great but vigilant staff made up for it."}
{"text":"Love the lo mein, sweet and sour soup and fried rice I have only ate once in the restaurant and it was great. But I love that they have a big area that they deliver to and now I just have delivery fast and efficient.  Very happy with the food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Food is still good, but be careful when ordering online. I ordered the Siu Wok dinner, and online it shows: SIU WOK DINNER $11.95 PER PERSON, Choice of Soup: Wonton, Egg Flower or Hot & Sour Plus Fried Shrimp, Egg Roll, B.B.Q. Pork & Fried Rice. When I call to confirm my on my order was received, I was told that the soup would be an additional $5. When I brought this to managements attention, the response was \"we need to make some adjustments\", but no offer to make it right or honor their website."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Sweet n sour chicken lunch combo special. Not gourmet of course but very good quality for everyday Chinese. Big portions, good service, and a huge bargain. You should go here."}
{"text":"Tried to get delivery tonight. First, I called 4-5 times and it was busy. I finally got through, and they said 45 minutes. That was at 7:30. At 9:00 I called for an update. They couldn't have cared less. They were so apathetic about the situation. All they could say was the driver left, but they didn't know when or where he was. At 9:15, I ended up calling, canceling the order, and asking for a refund. I was excited to have a  quick, fast, and delicious Chinese delivery in the neighborhood, but after tonight, I probably will not be calling again."}
{"text":"This is literally my most favorite place to get Chinese food, like ever. It's my family & I's go to spot. I always order a small egg drop soup and either a combination plate or a dinner plate of the lemon chicken. Not all of their chicken is white meat, so if that matters to you ask before ordering. The price is SO good for what you get. Their \"eggrolls\" are actually spring rolls and I'm not a huge fan of them. We've ordered take out and it's almost as good as when you sit down. The chicken doesn't get mushy or dry. My boyfriend always orders the sweet and sour and it's one if his favorite dishes, ever. The staff has always been super sweet to us. The same woman always waits on us and is still trying to learn English so please be patient and kind. She's so sweet. We love her. She's a sweetheart. I will say that their orange chicken is VERY salty. I always compare orange chicken to Panda Express and it's a completely different taste here. Their sesame chicken is pretty salty as well but not as bad! I definitely recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Great food - delivery is fast and the food is alway hot.  The egg foo yong is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Let me tell you, outside of NY, it's hard to find decent Chinese food.  I've only eaten at 2 other Chinese spots here in Phoenix (West Valley) (aside from PF Changs - which I don't consider Chinese (Asian Fusion?) but as far as local Chinese spots, this one is good.  I can't really judge too much as my take out from this place has been pretty limited, but the chicken and broccoli is good (I've had it 2x now).  I've also tried the Lo Mein and that was pretty good too!  The egg rolls are par (I've had better / I've had worse) and the Hot and Sour soup is pretty good.  I've never had Hot and Sour soup with big pieces of shrimp in it, but to my surprise, it was good.  And I'll tell you, if those are the size of the shrimp in any combination that has shrimp in it, it's a good deal!  I was disappointed however that the order didn't come with noodles!  Ummm, hello?  This is a Chinese restaurant, right?  I ordered a quart of Hot and Sour soup and I don't get noodles with it?  And I know it's an Arizona thing, but they've never heard of Duck Sauce?  Get with the program Arizona!  Duck sauce is where it's at!  I need it with my fried rice!  I had the lunch combination the second time I ordered from this place and it comes with 2 cream cheese wontons.  Surprisingly, they were delicious!  The fried rice, eh, I could take it or leave it.  It didn't blow me away.  I might have to try their dinner menu as it seems the combo's come with an Eggroll and Lo Mein as well as the main dish and rice.  Looks like a pretty good deal!  Again, my take on this place is pretty good.  I've only ordered 2x (Lunch) but both times I ordered, they didn't disappoint.  I can't rank it 5 stars as I've only tried like 2 of their dishes, but it was a decent sized portion, the prices are on par with other Chinese food options, and the food is good.  To my understanding, they also have a great delivery area; they deliver far and wide.  So, would I recommend it based on my experiences?  Absolutely!  I would definitely go back for take out here again.  However, this review could change when I change my order up a little.  I'm a little hesitant to try something new as I'm afraid I'll be disappointed, but from what I've tasted already, it's gonna have to be worth a shot..."}
{"text":"We are lazy and love our food delivered. Siu Wok is awesome for this! Accurate order, good food, huge portions and quick customer service."}
{"text":"They deliver downtown, hell yeah!  The food here has never been that great, but it has never been bad. They offer the traditional america/chinese menu at affordable prices, but they make you pay a minimum to deliver it which is understandable.   Yay!"}
{"text":"This place would be amazing if they would keep regular hours. Seems like every other time I want to go there they are closed for some reason. Atleast they could do would be to have an answering machine when you call stating that they are not open for whatever reason. Food is good if you can actually get it."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. We've tried 7 dishes over a few different occasions and none of it was good. Mind you, the fried appetizers are OK (egg rolls, crab puffs, fried scallops), but the entree dishes (Szechuan Beef, Scallops with Garlic Sauce, etc) are bland, spiceless and boring.There is very little meat / fish / protein and they are just loaded with fillers like celery, carrots, and green bell peppers. We couldn't even tell our orders apart, except for the meat in them. They all look alike with the same brown, corn starched sauce. The last order was probably the worst chinese food we've ever had. We won't be ordering from here anymore."}
{"text":"Great chinese food for cheap.  This is close to my office so I often get the lunch special or sometimes dinner.  Spicy chicken lo mein is my fav"}
{"text":"Weak sauce! I had the bubbles after eating here. Actually my family of four had the bubbles.   Curry chicken was very weak. If you like Chinese food that is on par with panda express, then this is the place for you. Think taco bell of Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Chinese food. The Kung Pao Chicken is my favorite, their Shrimp Fried Rice is bomb, and so are the potstickers. Never been in the restaurant but they have a great delivery service."}
{"text":"This food is made with msg which resulted in symptoms of sickness for all members that ordered. Although decent tasting, will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious,  best hot n sour soup I've ever had.  But please turn up the heat in there. We were FROZEN n and that's not comfortable for eating.  Service was very good too"}
{"text":"Amy D told me to go here so I never even bothered to read her 3-star review.  Probably would have reconsidered if I had seen that.  I ordered the orange chicken and it was a bunch of small chicken balls covered in orange goo.  The fried rice was missing the other stuff that usually comes in fried rice.  It took them 15 minutes to make it which was fine since we called ahead and it takes about that long to get there.    I'll just say it - China Chili is better in ever way.  I might come back here but everything about China Chili is better."}
{"text":"Ok, Ok, I gave 'em another chance. Let's just say last fall I had a shrimp fried rice that disagreed more with me than Rosie ODonnell disagrees with Anne Coulter. After several hours bowing to the porcelin god, I vowed never to return. Well, everyone deserves a second chance, rice, er, um I mean, right? Plus it SO convienent to my job and home. Pork lo mein has become a fav of mine and I actually crave it. For about $7 I usually have leftovers I can enjoy later. My bf Rickie is a spicy man so he loves spicy food, his craving, the Sun Devil chickien with gobs of jalepenos. We enjoy the crab puffs as well. Pretty standard Chinese fare, but the place lately has been spotless and the service great. It's tiny and probably does more take out and delivery. I say they're worth a shot if you're in the hood. Chow Chow yelpers!"}
{"text":"soooooo good!!!!!  I love eating in my jamms with my sweet baby!!!!   just ordered moo shu pork!  I cant wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Had food delivered last nigjt. The driver was great the person on the phone made me laugh.  The food was beyond words. Best egg fou young I have ever had. The only thing I would change is more vegetable s and meat in the fried rice. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've ordered here before with coworkers and usually, it's pretty decent for the price. (the lunch special)  I ordered teriyaki chicken and when my coworker came back with my food, I honestly didn't even want to eat it. The chicken just looked off and not what I have always been familiar with when it comes to teriyaki chicken. I ate a few bites though because my stomach was growling and after that, I decided to not even touch the chicken and I just ate the rice and eggroll.  The texture was incredibly rubbery and I am hoping at this point, it was actually chicken that I ate.  It just did not taste or look right at all..."}
{"text":"It's August 2015. I called for a delivery order at 9:00...no problem. I wanted Bean Curd in addition to Pork in the Twice-Cooked Pork...no problem. My order arrives in about 20 or so minutes. I'm used to Siu Wok having large portions and real ingredients, but this time they've outdone themselves. Won Ton Soup: 6 LARGE shrimp, thickly sliced pork, firm Won Ton and nicely done veggies (this would be almost two meals for me). The Twice-Cooked Pork wasn't their usual...normally the pork is sliced thin, this was thick slices of roast pork (the norm is thinly sliced and dark), good, but not twice cooked. This was a \"combo\" with a large serving of Lo Mein, some \"meh\" fried rice, a crunchy Egg Roll and the ubiquitous  Crab Puff. Pot Stickers/Fried Dumplings were very nicely done, with a spicy soy/vinegar dipping sauce.  Their prices have increased by a dollar since 2013, with the large entrees averaging 8.50 and the \"combo\" meal a dollar more. Portions are LARGE, so IMHO Siu Wok is still a great value. It's Asian-style comfort food and still my go-to for take-out Chinese."}
{"text":"Dont bother going by the prices posted on the online menu or the menu in the pictures.  Called tonight and placed an order for nyself that according to the menu should have equaled about 10 dollars and my total was 18.  Cancelled it and will not return to a place that wants to mislead customers and squeeze them with a much higher price at arrival.  For 18 bucks i could have had dinner at a much nicer place that doesnt try to take advantage"}
{"text":"traditional chines take out joint.  how can you really mess up americanized chinese food?  kinda greasy noodles and it tastes good actually-- but that could be my hung-over taste buds talking here.  nothing too special.  I mostly gave the 4 stars instead of 3 b/c they deliver pretty far-- I think within a 15 mile radius and they are cheap!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time today and it was a good, pleasant experience.. Food comes fast with a reasonable delivery charge and within a good time frame. Hot, fresh and delicious when it arrives. The beef and broccoli with rice was delicious. Love!"}
{"text":"Very sweet people and quick service. We like their shrimp and walnut entree. Good and reliable Chinese food for dinner :)"}
{"text":"I am very happy we found a local Chinese delivery place that is actually good. Ok I'm Asian and I'm from LA so I know good food when I taste it. After reading all the reviews, I decided to pick this place. I got the Kung pao chicken combo. Combo comes w rice, egg rolls and lo mein noodles. It was all very good.y husband got the beef and broccoli entree and it was pretty good. Not as good as Little Peking but this restaurant is closer to us and it delivers!!! The sizzling rice soup was phenomenal!!!!!! I highly recommend this soup and their combo dishes so that you can try different things. Their rangoons were very good too. So overall I will continue to get delivery from this place!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for Valley Chinese.  Been a few dozen times, as it was next to my old job. Greasy?  Yes.  Tasty?  Yes.  Cheap?  Pretty much. They deliver, which is way cool in my world! The General Chicken is decent.  So is the lo mein.   The place is clean.  Major points for that! Staff is really friendly, too.   I guess it's average, but better than most here in the PHX."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery if you want to order lunch at work.  Their chicken lo mien lunch special is pretty reasonable ."}
{"text":"I just ordered dinner from Siu Wok, and I couldn't be happier! The food was fast, affordable, and delicious! We ordered the Tangerine Chicken Combo, and the Beef with Broccoli Combo. Each combo comes with two crab puffs, and an egg roll, and the entree includes fried rice and Chicken Lo Mein.   Unlike most similar restaurants in the area, the meat portions were huge! And on top of the entree you they put a very generous amount of chicken in the lo Mein. I will definitely be coming back to them when I'm craving some Chinese food!   Thanks for hanging the menu on my door knob despite my \"No Soliciting\" post!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place an extra star because their delivery speed is second to none. The food is decent. However, I think the wonton soup is amazing. The soup is nice and hearty with lots of vegetables and meat to go along with the dumplings would you rarely find a. Good wonton soup. The service is very friendly and the food is prepared very fast overall not bad for a quick Chinese food spot in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love take out from this place. Very affordable for large parties and so delicious. The place does not look fancy or nice at all but the food makes up for it. Good For lunch limited parking."}
{"text":"In some thread a long time ago, Amy D said this place was way better than China Chili.  I was dubious to say the least.  We decided to try it for take out one night and see if the strange little place next to FEZ was good or not.  Well, my verdict is it's pretty great!  Not China Chili Orange Chicken spicy ok great, but it was really yummy.  When we ordered, my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I ordered, and consequently ate, way too much.  I got a small order of egg flower soup, which is actually pretty big, and the Honey Walnut Shrimp Dinner Combo.  Just saying that is a mouthful.  Anyway, the fried rice that came with the combo was just meh.  The Chicken Lo Mein was really tasty and could be a stand alone dish.  The Egg Rolls were really yummy and if I hadn't eaten too much already I would have ate the other one I traded for Crab Puffs.  I hate crab puffs so I didn't eat them.  The shrimp were yummy!  They don't have any breading or anything so that was a big plus and the totally bad for you sweet and tangy mayo sauce was awesome.  The walnuts were good too.  The best part of my meal though was the Egg Flower Soup.  It was FANTASTIC!  I've been dying to find a really good egg drop/flower soup for a long time now, because it's my favorite thing to eat when I'm sick.  I have finally found it.  I will most definitely be getting take out from Siu Wok again, and probably many many many more orders of soup."}
{"text":"i am so happy with Siu Wok. the food was yummy, got Pepper Steak, pork fried rice and tangerine beef.  the Pepper steak was seasoned right, mild spicyness and the sauce was exactly what i was looking for. vegies were still crisp and the meat was tender.  the tangerine beef was awesome. orangy but not overly orange. sweet in the best way, long red chili peppers soaking in the sauce. yum. the meat was fried crispy but  was still tender. just the way i like my tangerine beef.  the fried rice was great. nothing too fancy. just perfect.   the egg rolls were tasty and seemed fresh.  for the above it was around 23 bucks. very affordable.  the best part about the whole thing. they deliver. OMG!! chinese food delivered. Phoenix is a real city now. the delivery range is from 40th street to 40 ave, bethany home to broadway.   all in all a very good experiance and i will be ordering more from them. probably often."}
