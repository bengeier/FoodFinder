{"text":"DiSanto's is a good place to grab a quick bite on your lunch break. I eat here 2-3 times a week, and the food is decent. Jeff has different specials every day, ranging from pasta to Shepherds pie, or beef tips over noodles.  One thing that always delivers is the stuffed chicken, but the rest is hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Poor excuse for pizza. Ordered 2 toppings which were tossed on & pizza slice not re-heated. Pizza was \"dry\".  Service was prompt."}
{"text":"The pizza is not good at all. The pepperoni rolls are ok, but more than the food the people that work there are miserable and rude. It's not a pleasant experience at all. Most of the food is not good, however in a quick pinch and your sock of the other places to eat around here it's fine. Given other choices I would go somewhere else. Working in the building leaves you with limited option. It does appear pretty dirty."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad.  I think the pizza is decent.  The specials are hit or miss, but there is always something.  The people are friendly and get to know us \"regulars\".  He's a small business owner trying to make a few bucks. I stop here a couple times a week and have used his catering for office lunches."}
{"text":"This place is so pathetic. The pizza is incredibly mediocre and anyone could make it. The service is the worst part about it, though. I stopped in on my way home because I was hungry. I had no idea there was a $5 minimum when using a card for the entire building (possibly why very few stores/restaurants exist there anymore). I go to pay with card and I get lectured by the most miserable looking woman. \"Do you go to school in the building?\" I say, \"no, I go to Point Park.\" I'm only gonna do this one time!!!\" and then she lectures me angrily about how much it costs them. It was an honest mistake and I apologized. I have no issue with businesses only accepting cash, my issue is the awful customer service I received. I don't see this place staying open for long considering the service is terrible, pizza isn't hot, and the pizza is mediocre at best. It's only open because everyone likes shitty pizza and it's the only place around there where you can get a quick bite on a lunch break. I won't be returning ever again due to treatment I received."}
{"text":"The pizza and subs are excellent but I usually stray from the \"lunch specials\" because they are too expensive to be considered specials.   You just can't charge a customer $11.00 for a handful of tater tots and four bites of chicken. Also why is white meat more expensive? That's tacky."}
{"text":"This place is suppose to be a mall, but it more so like 5 stores all selling Steelers gear and a pizza place. The pizza place staff was pleasant, place was clean. I read the review for this place and was not willing to try, we were going to dinner in a hour but I was hungry now. So we decided to grab a slice and split it. It was ok, not the worst ever but surely not the best. Im from jersey/ny so pizza is very different. There was too much sauce and the sauce was not good, taste like from a can. Cheese was weird even though she put it in the oven to heat, the cheese on the pizza was still not melted. So not a fan but meh"}
{"text":"Watched the women here handle money and touch your food with unwashed bare hands right in front of my eyes.  I had a sub - they pulled the meat from a steamy water bin and put it straight on the bun making it really soggy.  Was tempted to ask for my money back but just played through the pain.  The place just looks dirty and dingy. I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"Working for a company with offices at Station Square gives limited options for lunch and it's easy to grow tired of the selections. I like this pizza shop because you can get a decent slice and they offer a variety of daily specials to help rid of the same old, same old."}
