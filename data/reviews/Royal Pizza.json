{"text":"This is NOT the BEST pizza in the world........ this pizza is cool....... just that...cool........ i'm a pizza LOVER so my expectations are high for any pizza I eat. The sauce is slightly sweet which I am not a fan of, the cheese is cool, toppings are too, maybe it was the sauce that took me away from it. I have been hearing many rant and rave about this pizza so I decided to give it a try, I don't regret it but its really nothing to write home about. NOTHING on Angela Mia (but who does??) If you are not to fond of E.C. then Carmino's on Pearl Rd is an excellent choice for a good pizza."}
{"text":"I am one of many Shaker Heights residents who thought nothing of driving across town for this pizza. Now...13 years later I reside 2 blocks from this heavenly pizza shop. Regardless of ownership or bakers this pizza is my 15 year favorite spot for serious pizza. No matter what ingredients the pizza crust is the best. The pies make up for what looks like a smaller pizza in a solid pie packed to the outer crust with ingredients. The current owners give the best bang for my dollar. Definitely five stars!"}
{"text":"Literally THE best pizza I've had in years...crust, sauce..everything!! And I've been looking..who knew? Highly satisfied."}
