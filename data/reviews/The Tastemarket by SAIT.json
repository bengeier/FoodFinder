Yes, you get lots of primo seating (windows with ample natural light) but having the different food counters like hot bowls & salads on the far side, bakery in the middle and the flatbreads on the other far side, you're wandering back and forth to see the different menus and then realize you have to line up at the respective counter to order what you want. I think it would be way more efficient to have one counter (with the complete menu!) to place your order.

I ordered my mango shrimp rice bowl and sat with my friend on the other side of the venue because he was getting flat bread. Even with a table marker, they had a bit of trouble finding me. I probably should have just waited at the counter instead of sitting down like they suggested.

My rice bowl was really good - lots of flavor from the coconut ginger rice and sweet mango. No shrimpy sized shrimps here! They were decent sized and cooked perfectly. My friend's flat bread fell flat. Nothing spectacular, and kinda lackluster.

I get that they use quality ingredients here, but there's no waitstaff and it's a culinary school not a full fledged restaurant so I don't understand the inflated pricing. The same applies for their Culinary Campus Market in Scotia Center too. There are surrounding trade schools (like Aveda and MaKami) that offer reduced services provided by students, I was under the impression that SAIT would be the same way too."}
{"text":"Very similar offerings to the SAIT Culinary Campus but with a few clear upgrades.

1.) Seating! You can actually sit here once you get your food, and there's lots of it. Tables, booths, etc... great for meeting friends for lunch

2.) Wine bar? Ummm yes please

3.) Charcuterie and flatbread station

They still have the pastry case, hot food options (but it seems they maybe don't change them as often as they do at the culinary campus?) and a drink bar. Wasn't as busy as I thought it would be when I stopped in but I'm sure as more of the lunch crowd hears about it it'll get busier."}

I hadn't been here before, but we looked at the food on display and decided to stay.  We sat on the Service side, but if you don't want to be served you can select a table on the other side of the restaurant.  I couldn't decide between the Croc Monsieur or one of the fancy sandwiches, but the waitress recommended the Prosciutto and Fig sandwich warmed up so I went with that.
It was SO good, I was craving it the whole next week (so I went back for it and got it to go).  Artisan baguette, arugula, tons of meat, then a layer of asiago cheese and finished with fig jam. It was heaven!"}
