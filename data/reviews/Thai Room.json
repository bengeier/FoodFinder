{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for years and it is always wonderful. I usually get the shrimp Pad Thai because its done so well. Their green curry is right on, too. Service is great and quick but not pushy. Quiet little atmosphere but not intimidatingly quiet. It's defiantly a place I bring friends. It's charming :)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to for thai food and we've eaten here many times. Their pad thai is good but not outstanding. If you are thinking noodles, I would encourage you to order the \"oodles of noodles\" plate instead."}
{"text":"We moved to Toronto 2.5 years ago and had not found good Thai food until tonight. We ordered with foodora and it was ready before the expected time. Generous portion sizes. We ordered the spring rolls, samosas, red curry chicken with rice and the chicken pad Thai. All were delicious with lots of chicken and fresh vegetables. Even our picky toddler had seconds. Lots of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Little place, excellent food. Thai tea, yellow curry lunch special was amazing 4 stars as I brought family and no kids menu at all I find this important for any restaurant as they conserve food by having it. Otherwise five stars."}
{"text":"These people are amazing.  Best customer service I've ever experienced ANYWHERE in Las Vegas. Fresh ingredients,  great atmosphere,delicious food... The hubby and I had the dinner specials. Him, Pad Thai and me Orange Chicken.  I was adventurous and even had the Thai beer. Amazing... you can't go wrong. I always feel like an outcast going to ethnic restaurants,  but the waitresses were so kind and helpful. Very customer service oriented. Thanks Thai Room for a rare experience. We will definitely be coming back... again and again and again.... :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out on a Friday night.  Food was ready for pickup in 15 minutes.  Great.  Came home and literally tore into the bag to get to the food as I could not wait to have the Lemongrass Veggie Soup, Chicken Pad Thai, and Basil Tofu that I ordered.   Unfortunately I found something to dislike about each dish.  The soup was too sweet.  The Basil Tofu...where were the freshly cooked basil leaves?  And the Pad Thai...where were the fresh bean sprouts and ground peanuts and lime that I would get to mix into the noodles?  I guess I'm used to the Thai food  from Atlanta.  For anyone who might find themselves in Atlanta and are looking for really delicious Thai food, try Thai of Norcross or Little Bangkok.  In any case, I hope this post helps the Thai Room find a way to take the food up a notch because I would love to brag about an east end gem in my new neighborhood.  What I can positively say is that the portions are generous and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Yum!! Very delicious and fresh food. The lunch special comes with so much food! For $6.95, I have lunch for two days!! :)"}
{"text":"Dear Thai Room staff,  Please forgive us for us rolling in at 9:20 on a weeknight totally oblivious to your closing time. We feel honored that you still took care of our unruly hungry bellies, and we're so glad to have experienced such delicious take-out!  You were actually our first introduction to Vegas, and the fact that you didn't turn us away spoke volumes to the credibility of your establishment and commitment to service. We had been driving all day, with three pets and the last of our moving boxes and your restaurant was the closest thing to where we were staying. Lucky for us! (Late night for you...)  We've since enjoyed many of your menu items, often as take-out but in the comfort of the restaurant as well. Thank you for delicious tom Kha, tofu larb, egg rolls, pad see ew, drunken noodles... And an extra star for being welcoming that first night we were moving in to our new place.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am posting this as an update on my previous review of the Thai Room on Milner Avenue. During my first visit in January, I was not a fan of the dishes that I had received for my take-out order. But I had a craving for Thai food like you would not believe and I had decided to try this place again for lunch. HUGE IMPROVEMENT!!! I had ordered the Beef in Oyster Sauce with a side of steamed rice. It was awesome, the meat was tender, the rice was fresh, the portions were very generous and I was definitely satisfied. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. All smiles, all around."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Atmosphere is the only thing keeping it from a 5 star review.  My spouse and I get take out from Thai Room 3-4 times a month.  Some of our favorites are the beef larb, any of their curries and their pad thai.  If you are looking for some tasty Thai food, particularly take out, look no further."}
{"text":"Brand new Thai place just west of Woodbine on the Danforth. Pad Thai with zesty tamarind sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai restaurant. Great food, prices, and portions. Everything I have tried here has been excellent. Panang Curry (w/chicken), Drunken Noodles (with beef), many appetizers, Mango Sticky Rice, and Thai Iced Tea. Good beer/happy hour specials also."}
{"text":"Great place ... great service. So far the best Thai place in Vegas. Great desserts (sticky rice w/mango) and coconut soup!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service! The prices are also really reasonable. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Thai food!"}
{"text":"Great meal at the Thai Room. The green and red prawn curries were tasty and the mango sticky rice desert was excellent! The servers were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The Deep Fried Bananas were to die for and most definitely worth the hundreds--if not thousands--of calories. The samosas were great too. I also enjoyed the Beef Pad Thai.   However, the crispy tofu was rough and tasted like cardboard, even with the orange and peanut sauce. I would not order that again."}
{"text":"The vegetarian appetizer platter is simply amazing.  Great value for money to try out a sampler of their signature appetizers.  Vegetarian cold roll is very refreshing, it is an enormous roll or tube of green salad  Their house-made peanut sauce is delicious. I will return to try out their lunch special."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely lives up to its name, THAI ROOM AUTHENTIC THAI AND ASIAN CUISINE.  DELICIOUS!  DELICIOUS!  DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Tom Yum shrimp soup spicy level 2 and Pad Thai.  I haven't had Thai food this excellent since being in L.A. (Los Angeles) From the cozy ambience with 2000s hits and today's hits, this place is definitely a place to come and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Do not judge this place on the outside appearance. this.was my fourth time eating there two for lunch time and two for dinner time .the Thai curry is off the hook just the right amount of spice and full of flavor fresh and big proportions as an added bonus the price is just right so I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like their combo options and upgrade options of rice. The taste of the food however was very disappointing and definitely not authentic Thai flavours. The veggie pad thai was overwhelmingly vinegar-y that I would cough every time I brought a bite close to my mouth. The vegetable malay curry was mediocre and very thick. The food was so unappetizing that most of it was thrown out in the end. The delivery service and packaging was the only redeeming factor sad to say."}
{"text":"This place is always my Bf and I go to place if we don't wanna cook at home. The food is always good!! Especially their drunkin noodles!! Their dinner special is pretty cheap! And comes with lots of stuff."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Ordered something online and when it came, it was dry and extra hot. When i call them, they said they couldn't help at all and the processing the amount I purchased was too low to warrant the trouble of helping me anymore. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Stay away."}
{"text":"My partner and I wandered the neighbourhood and passed this restaurant along our walk.  The restaurant is Thai & Malaysian.  We asked our waitress what she recommends.  She asked what flavours we like (peanut sauce is our fav).  From her recommendation we tried the fried tofu with peanut sauce on the side for appetizer.  It is a good portion and authentic chunky peanut bits in the sauce.  For entree we ate fried Red Snapper with tamarind sauce (it had plenty of green onion, white onion, red pepper).  We also had the golden curry with beef.  The sauce was creamy and hit the spot!  I enjoy the meal with ginger tea (more natural tasting).  Our waitress was friendly and made great recommendations for our dining experience tonight!  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is the only Thai place in the area so thought we'd give it a try. And after we did, we would not be coming back. The pad Thai tasted like ketchup and there were paper fibers in our food. The chicken was spongy.. The food just doesn't compare to places like sukhothai."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery; shrimp pad Thai, veg spring rolls, coconut sticky rice with mango. My first time, simply because my regular place is closed for renovations. Spring rolls were okay, I found the filling a little mushy. Pad Thai was fine, more of the sweet tomato flavour which I am not a huge fan of. Lots of shrimp was a pleasant surprise, even if the noodles were a little dry.  Coconut sticky rice was not served the way I am used to - it was just all mixed together, where I am more accustomed to the rice, covered in coconut milk, topped with ripe mango.  While not terrible, I probably wouldn't order here again."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant in USA  I really recommend this restaurant to all Thai people or even foreign customers because they know each customer wants, service is so great , I can come here everyday, really like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Thai!  Excellent thai iced tea, average hot sake.  4/5 Yellow curry, absolutely worth another visit.  Lunch special came with soup and a mini-salad.  I think a drink comes with it, but all I wanted was the tea."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas. I have been going here for years. Whenever I try other Thai restaurants, I always compare them to Thai Room. It's either \"this is almost as good as Thai Room\" or \"Thai room is better.\" Haha. We drive out of our way just to eat here when we want our Thai food fix :o)"}
{"text":"Spring rolls were good, hot and sour soup was good. The pad Thai was awful! Ketchupy is the right word. They need to work on it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch takeout today with a few co-workers.  We ordered 20 minutes ahead and it was ready when we arrived.  Our order consisted of Curry Pad Thai and Cashew Nut Chicken.  Both were quite good but definitely had more of a Malaysian ( maybe a twist of Indian too?) flavor to it, especially the Curry Pad Thai.  I usually expect curry pad thai to be a bit more saucy but this version is dry-  not bad,  just not quite what I am used to.  The cashew nut chicken was good- large portion with the rice served separately.  Kudos for that!  The dining room is quite small (it's a play on the name I guess as that is precisely what it is- a room), and wasn't too busy for a Friday.  Given that this place is in a plaza with a couple of different food options (Teriyaki Experience, Freshii etc),  it is a good location.  There is an option for 10% off if you pay cash which I wish I had known about earlier but will keep that in mind for the next visit.  Overall,  I would return to try some of their other lunch specials but I will still always love Jatujak in Scarborough for my go-to Thai food fix."}
{"text":"Ive been here many times,  food is good.  The staff is not so friendly they could use a face lift on customer service.  Besides that no complaints!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall Thai restaurant with good food! My girlfriend and I both had the lunch special which consisted of a cup of soup a entree a salad rice and a soft drink all for $6.95 she had the pad Thai and I got the chow mein both were really good you can't be a good cheap meal!"}
{"text":"I have been here and have also taken out food a few times. Not the greatest thai food and not the best portions when it comes to meat.  I'd give it a pass."}
{"text":"Need to preface this by saying I have never been TO the restaurant... I just order takeout via just-eat.ca  The food is fantastic! And very large portions for decent prices. Delivery is always under 1 hour.  Favourites include the house pad Thai, and the avocado tofu veggie thing in peanut sauce. The ONLY place I order Thai from! Can't wait to try in restaurant."}
{"text":"superb customer service...I would recommend thai tea w boba, panang curry, beef & meatball noodles soup"}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:30 pm tonight (Saturday) and only two other tables were taken.  So quiet for a Saturday night but food was delicious and service was excellent.  We had chicken satay skewers for dinner...it was good but the sauce could have had a little more zing to it.  I had the red chicken curry and he had a fried beef dish. I'd go back for sure"}
{"text":"The WORST customer service. I tried to simply substitute the soup out of the spicey lovers combo because it's gross, the girl on the phone went to the owner who decided to decline our request for another item priced the same as the soup. They would rather lose a customer then substitute. I decided to give them a second chance and ordered tonight. My order came to 19.97 and they insisted I must pay a delivery fee plus tax on the delivery fee because my order is not $20. They were very rude and this place will just outright make you angry with their service. Their food is average at best."}
{"text":"Best thai take-out in the city. I've never been to the actual place but at least once a week I order from here and I'm never disappointed. The must-haves: green curry chicken, spicy drunken noodles and red curry shrimp.   Hint: If you order more than 40 bucks you get an order of pad thai for free!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here. The service was amazing ! true we were the only ones there at first but more people came as we were eating. We had spring rolls which arrived really fast as well as our main meals we couldn't believe how quickly our food was prepared and that it was so hot even though we were still eating our spring rolls it stayed hot !  The pad Thai had a bit too much sauce so for me it was too sweet but still really good. my husband had the chicken fried rice and that was really good."}
{"text":"I am indeed a fan of this place.. my favourite dish is the oodles of noodles - very flavourful noodle dish that comes with thick yellow noodles.. definitely has more of a Malaysian flavour to it than authentic Thai.. i absolutely love Thai and Malay food so this place to me is a combo of both and satisfies my cravings for both types of cuisines.. another winner for us is the pineapple rice with shrimp and chicken - although it could be improved - was too sweet for my family's liking.. perhaps, i will ask for extra spicy next time.. I also enjoyed the red curry - flavourful.. will be returning :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order so often from Thai Room that the delivery guy is practically a weekly visitor to our place. Each time we order, we try to get something different from the menu.   Calling in to place an order is easy peasy. They keep your phone number on record so you don't have to keep giving them your address every single time.  Green curry chicken -- the menu states it's a popular item, and with good reason. It's not very spicy either. All their curries are tasty with varying degrees of spiciness--other ones I can vouch for include the Red Curry Lamb, Malay Curry Lamb and the Green Curry Vegetables. Smother it over some coconut rice and you're set. It also works well as leftovers you can bring for lunch.   Other favourites starting from most loved are the Thai spicy noodles (pad kee mao), crispy beef, oodles of noodles, mango chicken and green mango salad  I didn't enjoy the pad Thai as much, but maybe it's because Bamboo Garden's version (now closed, *sobs*) will always have my heart. The Beef with Vegetables reminds me of a dish my father used to make us when we were growing up. Out of all the appetizers, the satay skewers were the best.   Coconut rice. I love this stuff  And they have ice cream! Vanilla, mango, coconut, green tea and lychee.   Mains range from $10.99 to $16.99  Good to know: Free spring roll for food orders over $25 before tax  Free chicken pad Thai for food orders over $40 before tax  Free entree (under $12 value) for food orders over $50 before tax.   Delivery time: 45min to an hour"}
{"text":"I've never had dinner there but have ordered often.  I have to say, best Thai food I have had in Toronto.  Their Green Curry Chicken and Malay Lamb is amazing and their portions are large (and include rice!).  I have never been dissapointed here.  I live just down the street so perhaps I should soon try the restaurant as well - it looks quite nice from the outside!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Thai restaurant! They have an excellent lunch menu. I have only tried three entrees with chicken; the were the pad thai, pad see ew, and chow mein. I gave the review a four star because I was disappointed in their pad thai because it was just ok & I have had better at other local Thai restaurants. However the other two entrees were delicious especially the pad see ew. Whenever I have ordered food to pick up it was very quick as well!"}
{"text":"Best thai place in Vegas! I lived in Thailand and I can say that this is very authentic. I love the curries and the papaya salad. But everything I have had on their menu has been delicious. If you haven't tried this yet you are missing out!"}
{"text":"The food doesn't seem fresh anymore.  My crab rangoon had a long hair in it and the cream cheese tasted off, extremely sour and inedible.  The food is inconsistent and some of the staff is a bit rude.  I ordered 5 minutes before they end their appetizer special price and the woman on the phone argued with me that the special was over, the special was still available, but I guess she just didn't want to give me the discount.  They used to be giving, sweet, and the food was great.  So unfortunate, I will never order from here again especially since I don't trust that the food is safe to consume."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Do not order the Malaysian salad. Unless you like sour (lemon) and sweet (sugary peanut sauce) and a bunch of ingredients haphazardly thrown together.   The rest was ok. Service wasn't great."}
{"text":"The  Thai  Room  is  a  hidden  gem,  off  strip  and  a  favorite  for  the  local  people.   I  order  take  out  four  or  five  times  a  year  and  have  never  been  disappointed.   I've  tried  a  variety  of  their  entrees  and  it's  all  good  but  my  go  to  favorites  are  the  Fried  shrimp  and  fried  wonton,  Pad - Thai  noodles  and  Pad - Prik - King.   They  get  it  right  every  time."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the customer service. I ordered delivery through Just Eat (samosas, pad thai, mango sticky rice) and *SPECIFICALLY* stated in the notes section NOT TO ADD NUTS to any of the dishes due to an allergy. When the food arrived 55 minutes later, guess what? Cashews right on top of the mango sticky rice. I called the restaurant to complain, and either get my money back ($6.99 + tax) or a credit or gift certificate, something!, since now I've just had to throw $6.99+ in the garbage due the restaurant's oversight, but the kind woman who answered the phone (she really was nice) put me on hold and checked with whomever who she said \"swears up and down\" that he didn't put cashews in the dish. I told her I have a photo -- please, judge for yourself whether those are cashews or not -- but she said the owner refuses to accept photos referencing food allergy issues because there's so much fraud, or something. Whatever. She said she could have another made up for me and sent over, and that the delivery guy would take the original dish back, but I don't particularly want to wait another 55 minutes (until after 10p) to get a dessert. #sad"}
{"text":"This place never looks busy but it should be all the time. This food is super fresh. I love love love their crab rangoon and their red curry. Its right next to my favorite grocer, sprouts and thought id pop in. This my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I hate to rate any businesses with a low rating, but I had a rather disappointing experience. I ordered through just eats two days ago. One of the dish ordered was the Malaysian Salad. I was really excited to try it, but the salad was delivered without the peanut sauce. It was so dry and bland, I couldn't really eat it.   I called up the restaurant to inform them, I was informed that the driver was not answering the phone and the kitchen staff have left for the night. So I asked if I could be refunded for the salad, the staff answered \"fine\" and hung up on me.   The next day I called back to follow up on the matter. I was told that they have no record of this. I was asked to leave my name and number because the manager was not in yet. I was assured that the manager will call me back at 4 pm when he comes in. No calls. No refunds. Nothing."}
{"text":"I am a picky eater and have tried many Thai restaurants from all over North America and I must say that this place is my favourite Thai restaurant.  Food: I have tried the Pad Thai, Curry Pad Thai and Oodles of Noodles... each one was so rich in flavour, the noodles were perfect, there was a fair balance of meat & vegetables with the big portions of the noodles.   Service: Quick and friendly.  If you're looking for WONDERFUL Thai food, this place is a MUST. By far the best Thai food I have ever had."}
{"text":"The food was a 4 star but the service and mango with sticky rice was off the charts. We love mango with sticky rice and this place is the best we've had."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Thai Room twice using skip the dishes so I haven't actually set foot in the restaurant.  My go to in the area is Thai Bamboo and that would still be my preference but this was easy to order from.  The fried rice is quite tasty but the pad Thai and coconut soup was not to our liking.  Their curries seem to be decent as well as the cellophane noodles and veggies were delicious.  I think we won't order from here for awhile though.  The delivery was very fast and the food was hot still when delivered."}
{"text":"Coconut Soup Best in Nevada.. Just moved back from Arizona and can't wait to get my soup fix, I have missed it.  No other Thai Restaurant can match it even in Arizona.  I have tried always disappointed."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai around. Easy. Way better than the Basil place down the street where i ended up throwing out the food.  Always fresh and good portions. The curries are great and so is the peanut veggie dish. Whenever I order from there and have company with discerning Thai food taste they are always impressed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down best staff and service and food I've ever found not at all expensive and it's been here n the same spot since I was a kid I take my son here all the time we've been coming for years and if you don't try this place you've definetly passed on one of the best Thai places in Vegas !!!!"}
{"text":"I had been driving by Thai Room for a few years now. My husband and I love Thai food, but had always gone to a different restaurant. One night we decided to try Thai Room. This may sound silly, but we keep making up reason to keep coming back. Oh, your sisters in town, let go to the Thai Room for lunch. I just got home, its \"too late\" to start dinner, lets go to the Thai Room. The food and service is outstanding. Everything is cooked to order and so good. The Tom Yum soup is the best we have ever had. The Pad Thai is perfect, not sweet like so many other restaurants make it. My fav, the Drunken Noodles, YUMMM!  And if you are in the area for lunch, very nice selection, $6.95 includes, soup, salad, rice, veggie roll, drink, and entree!. And you won't be waiting for your food. Your drink and soup are delivered right away, and about the time you finish your soup your lunch arrives. Plenty of time on a lunch break. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a big rush of people ordering their pad thai on the first day. All were significantly disappointed. The sauce tasted like it was 95% Off-brand Ketchup.  Mixed reviews on the other food on the menu but fairly positive"}
{"text":"Thanks Thai Room for sending me the best Pad Thai in a while - will order again soon!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! Found it off of GroupOn. Good portions. Rice is a bit dry but I have sauce with it so I'm all good! :) would come back."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my time here. And tonight was no exception! The golden and green curries, the garlic and pepper lamb and the chicken and shrimp phad woon sen (glass noodles) were all A Class. The service was attentive (almost too frequent lol). The only thing I had issue with was being shout greeted at from behind the counter. The gentleman was friendly and pleasant but please stop yelling, sir. Anyway, I'll definitely definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My fav is the pompano fish with curry sauce and the beef jerky. Pad Thai is delicious as well. Sticky rice with sliced mango for dessert is yummy!!"}
{"text":"We have a few Thai Restaurants in our neighbourhood that we have tried to order from. This is our go-to. We aren't adventurous in our choices, but the Green Curry is yummy, the Cashew Nut Chicken is delicious, we like the Glass Noodles - veggie and chicken. You get a discount when you order take-out so we usually get a mango salad and the family is happy!  Great portion sizes, friendly staff, yummy food!  Thanks Thai Room!"}
{"text":"Waste of money for mediocre slop. $29.20 for soup, egg rolls, and basil chicken. Robbery. Soup was missing something, it was sour and a poor substitute for the real thing (Tom Yum - nah, Tom Yuck more like). The egg rolls were pathetically small (mini) at about $1 each for 6! Stomach hurts. Honestly, wish I could give NO stars!!! How many hours did I work for this??? (How many hours will I PAY for this?) Thai Room, you don't deserve to be in business. (Could be poster child for Mr. Yuk.) Scam purveyors of slop. What a rip off. Patrons beware."}
{"text":"0 stars!!! this company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We have ordered from them several times with many large orders for family and friends. Tonight we wanted to order one curry chicken, spring rolls and a side of steamed rice which came to $19.97. They wanted to charge us a $3 delivery charge + added tax to that because it did not come to $20 (3 cents away!) . When asked to speak with the manager the server was rude, unknowledgeable and would not transfer the phone call after putting me on hold more than 3 times and speaking in a condescending tone. On a previous occasion we wanted to substitute the hot soup for the spicy lovers for two combo. Again, the customer service was absolutely terrible. DO NOT ORDER from this company, you will be severely disappointed!    Please note, I have increased my rating of this company because after this comment was seen the manager contacted me through Facebook. She let me know the employee was new and the charge is not usually applied. Also, that they do value customer service so she generously credited our account. We will try to order from this company again."}
{"text":"My date and I were in the area, so we decided to check this place out after seeing some great reviews on Yelp - we weren't disappointed. Easily the best thai food I've ever had. I got the curry pad Thai, and my date had the basil tofu. Both dishes were very flavorful, and generous with their portions. Even the steamed rice was fragrant!   Great service; our server was attentive and quick. The price is also extremely reasonable. The restaurant itself is cozy and clean. Neither my date or I live near this area, but I'm sure we'll be returning just for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"i feel bad saying this but just ordered from here and this is the worst pad thai i have ever tasted. wouldnt have ordered from here if i had other options but it was late and one of only thai restaurants open. do not order their pad thai"}
{"text":"Service was below par and dishes were okay.  The chicken was salty and the pad thai soggy.  There were a few tables occupied by diners and the ratio of staff to customers was equal.  The food arrived at our table in a timely manner and had no communication with staff until the end of our meal.  After finishing we waited patiently for several minutes where our waiter had to be motioned over to bring the bill for us to pay."}
{"text":"They hosted a wedding reception, so we had the whole restaurant, fixed menus.  Great job in many respects - all guests served at the same time.  Food was appealing, hot, plentiful.  Service was very good - proactive, helpful, quick.  It's difficult to cater such an event - kudos to the staff."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit run down but the food is excellent. My coworkers and I come here all the time because you can't beat their $7 lunch menu.  It comes with a drink, their soup of the day (dine in only), and your entree. The serving size of their entrees are pretty generous. I usually get the Pad Thai lunch which is about 1 1/2 cups, rice (choice of steam or fried), salad and egg roll. I've had their boba drink (taro) which is really good too. The place can sometimes get full during the lunch/noon hour but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nice place. Nice service, polite server. Food was ok and big portions. Will revisit. I got Coconut Chicken Soup - 6.99 Red Curry Beef Mango - 12.99 Imported beer - 2 bottles."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go! It's quick and convenient especially lunch time specials $6.95.  Reason I gave it 3 stars is although they do a pretty good job on service and food is decent price for what it is, it's the second time I got a fly in my soup....so I'm wondering how they are getting an A on the food inspection part?"}
{"text":"Yum-yum! The vegetarian green curry had just the right amount of heat and coconut flavour.  The veggies were fresh and crisp instead of grey and soggy.   Had a bowl of brown rice with that and they threw in a couple of crispy spring rolls.  Prompt and friendly, good start to this new place."}
{"text":"Too bad I started a vegetarian streak so I didnt order my regular dishes ie. Beef salad and beef pad see ewe...Instead, I had the drunken noodle w/ tofu. It was very tasty and service was good. Will come back :)"}
{"text":"Great tasty food!! Try the devil chicken.... trust me. You'll love it. Service is nice and friendly. Price is fair."}
{"text":"Oh dear.   I was seriously skeptical about this after seeing some of the reviews, but my flatmate wanted to try it regardless and I eventually decided \"why not?\". Bad move.   I chose the \"Famous Pad Thai\" and... It didn't particularly taste like Pad Thai. It didn't taste of much actually. Obscene amount of tofu. Not a great deal of chicken and shrimp. Not a vegetable in sight. Stodgy noodles. Just fucking awful. I threw half of it away. Worst takeaway I've had in a long time, and a slightly depressing waste of money.   My flatmate had the \"Golden Curry Chicken\" and he thought it was alright. I couldn't possibly justify trying a different dish in future though, my meal was just too bad. Delivery was around 45 minutes (I think)."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was mushy. Fried rice is not greasy but tastes bland on lunch specials. Kung Pao is the weirdest and wettest I've had.  One waitress in particular is extremely rude.  Ask for extra napkins or plates and she really enjoys rolling those eyeballs and it's usually done with a smirk.  She likes wearing coral or ruby red type lipstick colors, has dark skin.  Not returning.  Too bad because this is a good location."}
{"text":"Best authentic thai food in Vegas. Among our favorites: special hot and sour chicken soup with young tamarind leaves, eggplant basil, stir fry chinese broccoli, fresh po pia. Trust us, we are thai."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food: green mango salad, Malay curry chicken and green curry vegetables. (Takeaway)"}
{"text":"Went there last night on a discovery mission. Allison the waitress was great. Fast and attentive. Food was hot and tasty. Not as authentic as young Thailand around the corner.  Needs to find flavor niche w 4 Asian restaurants within 100m. Still with dining here just to meet the server"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently ate here and we both got the pad Thai. It was so good and flavourful.  What I like most was the service. The food came fast and the waiter was very nice, I think she said her name was Christianne.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and good service."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment since it first opened and have continued to be a regular costumer. The dining area and ambiance is nice. Its quiet and versatile for date night, friends, or casual family dinner. The service is also great and food arrives rather quickly. But I have to be honest, and admit that the Thai Rooms food falls under the category of \"Thai-fusion restaurants\" like Thai One or Thai Express because they do not serve authentic Thai food and they all have similar tastes in flavor.   The Thai Room serves Indian/Thai Fusion dishes but their food still satisfies my Thai food craving. Their food is also on the better quality side of what you would expect from restaurants alike.  I personally always order the Signature Pad Thai with their calimari. It has a tangy and sweet tomato/ shrimp paste base sauce and the dish definitely fills you up. (I can never finish this by myself). To balance the tangy and sweet Pad Thai I pair the dish with the savory, flavorful, and crispy calimari and it becomes a match made in heaven. Then to finish it off and cleanse the palate, I'll simply have a couple scoops of mango ice cream. I reccomend this place if you want a convenient  quick Thai food fix.   TIP: To get their best food experience it is better to dine in where the food especially the Pad Thai is piping hot and fresh. Their takeout is still as delicious but because of the rice noodles that they use, the noodles soak up all the sauce and dries up quickly. Also if the Pad Thai has been sitting or you plan to have left overs the next day, inside the container the noodles eventually stick and clump together as the sauce dries out. To avoid dry noodles in your takeout order ask for extra sauce, but I only reccomend this for takeout orders."}
{"text":"I am actually thinking of sending my order into a lab to find out if my chicken was actually rodent meat. I swear there was rat tails in the curry pad thai. I am actually on the verge of puking. This has to be the worst thai food I've ever had.  I am utterly disgusted right now."}
{"text":"I had authentic Thai food before. This restaurant- each dish is either too sweet or two sour. Tom yum soup is kinda plain. Pai Thai is very amature. Green curry chicken is good."}
{"text":"Cheap food. Vegan and veg friendly. Fast and courteous service."}
{"text":"How sad!! We finally found a great place to enjoy Thai food and the waitress/owner (obviously) was so disrespectful and even slamed the menu right in front of our face. When I told her if she was okay and if not we could go she rolled her eyes and started speaking in her native language. She refused to serve us and another waitress was very nice to continue where she left off. The only reason we stayed was because we had preordered our food and it was ready. Sad to say last time as go thers."}
{"text":"this place has been our go-to for so long, great lunch specials, soups are amazing, fried rice, Pad-See-Ew, all bomb.com. They're super friendly & orders are brought out quick. Love this place"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere! Very welcoming, and great customer service as the waitresses kept checking up on us to make sure everything was good.  The food was amazing! We did not have to wait long either since we went in at a good hour. We got the mushroom Tom yum soup, spicy Malay shrimp curry & spicy chicken noodles. The noodles without a doubt turned out to be one of the best we have ever had.  The spicy level is actually serious as it was really spicy, so be prepared before ordering.  Regardless, the food was great and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I eat here at least twice a month.   Very good food and friendly service. I'm particularly a fan of the Thai Basil dish. Being vegetarian (these days, anyway) I get it with the fried tofu, and it is a treat.  The lunch specials are amazing. I often wind up with lunch, desert, and a soda for under $10.  Caveat: this is a small place, and they can get overwhelmed. If you walk in and see lots of people, prepare to dine at a leisurely pace. It's worth it.   Also: it is not fancy.  It is tucked in between Goodwill and a Vape shop. There is some tape on the booth seats, and the carpet could be replaced.  Still it always feels clean - and the Goodwill next door is pretty nice as those things go.   Recommended for cheap and cheerful food - especially at lunch."}
{"text":"I am very happy with the pad thai, not spicy but that's ok. The waitress were super sweet. Fast services. I really was impressed"}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 Thai places in Las Vegas ; the flavor is authentic and everything I have gotten has been tasteful . The only reason I don't give a 5 star is because when I've order there lunch special I promise it's tasteful but I order Kung pao shrimp and I only had like two of shrimp in it . But overall great place I recommend."}
{"text":"They ripped us off twice. We ordered 5 different meal items and only received 3 items. When we called back we were offered a discount on our next order because it was the end of the night and the kitchen was closed. On the following order we were under the impression that the discount would be considered on the order since they explicitly said, \"We will automatically add the discount to your next order, it's in the system\". This discount was not added AND, once again we were missing an item on the 2nd order. I called them immediately and after many garauntees  that our next order will be in absolute order we again decided to give them the opportunity to make it whole the next time. That next time happened about a month later. When I mentioned to them about our discount and that it should basically be free since they owed us 3 items, I was put on hold. After being on hold for almost 5 minutes I hung up and called back. I was yelled at by a man, (not the woman who took my order). He basically said that there is nothing that says they owe me anything because I can't prove there was anything missing. He also said I should have checked my order in front of the delivery person. Really?  Who takes all the food out while the driver is still there? We will never give them our money again, I think they took enough of it. I can't really give a review on the food since we really never got any of it."}
{"text":"I live right next to the restaurant. I have a three year old daughter with autism and she is a very picky eater. One of the few things she eats and loves, is the pad Thai here. We order it probably three times a week. Deliver, pick up for take out, dine in... you name it. We loved this place, the server knew us and our order by heart.  I took my daughter and my 16 month old son to dine in yesterday. My autistic daughter who has just become semi verbal was greeting everybody with an emphatic \"hi!\" And smiling and happy to be out. It was a 75% full restaurant. The server That has taken care of us for the year and a half we have lived here, asked us to leave because other customers were complaining about my daughter being loud.  Let me repeat that.  I was asked to leave this restaurant because my autistic child was apparently ruining other guests experience.  As I then said that we no longer wished to eat here, ever again, she tried to tell me to please understand. I work in a restaurant.  So does my husband.   I understand that this was absolutely discrimination and if I could go and take this instance further than just a review, I would.  My child struggles enough with daily things in life. It was very sad as I packed my kids up and my daughter is crying bye food, bye pad Thai.  I took the opportunity to kiss my child's face and remind her that she's beautiful and did absolutely nothing wrong.   A nice man and one of the guests we apparently disturbed helped us out. I said I was just asked to leave because my special needs child was disruptive and he was appalled.   F this place. And if anybody has any advice on how I can make this a bigger deal, please let me know. I will be letting the autism community know as well.  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I highly enjoyed this place. The food was great. The service was amazing. I loved it! I had the pineapple rice, and the crab wontons were AMAZING. afer everything, they gave us fresh and neatly cut watermelon! YUM!!! Yeah, GREAT food!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here cause is close to my house! To start the service is always friendly and oh my god their fast! Never had a problem, this last time I order my Thai ice tea which is always on point, and to start got the small Tom Kah soup with chicken the broth was great but can't care less about the though small pieces of chicken! Any way I also ordered the Panang curry with shrimp! And it didn't disappoint me just like the red, yellow and green curry!                                                    I keep hearing about their lunch specials that I haven't had the chance to try, but maybe I'll soon next time I go grocery shopping since they are next to Sprouts."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place since everyone was ordering so I decided to try it.  I ordered the spicy house fried rice and my spicy level was at a 4 but next time I will have it a 5 since I love spicy food.   The food was absolutely delicious and very flavorful and will be getting the same dish again.  Of course there was plenty of meat since I got the house fried rice however I just didn't like that the shell was still on the shrimp but I just took the tail end off and it was fine. There was enough leftover for me to have later on at home.   They have a really huge menu and I wish I could have gotten hot and sour soup but didn't want to pay extra since I didn't get the lunch special.  I have been wanting some really good Thai food and glad somebody at work ordered it so now I will have somewhere to go until I find a better place (if any).  I can't really speak on the service since I wasn't the person who placed the order but they did arrive at the time they promised since it was all of our lunch time.  Give them a try if you like Thai food and if you like spicy Thai food get the level 4 as a start then you can rev it up to a 5."}
{"text":"I've been living across the street from this awesome little Thai joint for the past two-and-a-half years. Whether I opt for eating in or takeout, I am always left satisfied.   THE GOOD: - First off, let's talk about portions: they are massive. Each fried rice order comes with heaps and heaps on the plate, and their pad thai dishes and curry bowls are also more than generous.  - Given the generous portion sizes here, I think the prices are fair. I don't mind shelling out ~$10 for fried rice or ~$14 for a curry when I know I'll have enough leftovers for an additional meal or two.  - Service has always been prompt and pleasant during my visits. They once made a mistake on my takeout order and charged me tax twice, but when I called them to correct this mistake, they didn't hesitate to give me a credit towards my next meal. To me, that's what customer service is all about - taking measures to correct mistakes when they arise and keep the customer happy.  - Finally, let's take note of some of their best menu items! When I'm in a pad thai mood, I love their Beef Curry Pad Thai - it's packed with flavour. They also have a fantastic Panang Curry Chicken and Green Curry Chicken - I go back and forth between these two depending on my mood. All curries come with steamed rice, but to kick things up a notch, I like to pair mine with their Chicken Fried Rice or Coconut Rice.   THE BAD: - I have no complaints about my beloved Thai Room. 5/5 stars!  Thai Room actually has 5 locations across the GTA. If you're lucky enough to live near one as well, do pay them a visit - you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Food is descent, some items are good the some are so-so. Decor is nice, cozy ambience, nice lightings, and clean. Paintings displayed here are for sale. Service though, VERY RUSHED! We were there Thursday evening, there are about 3 tables, not crowded, no line up outside. At that time, there was one waitress, which is sufficient for the amount of guests. She gave us the menu, brought us ice water, and some lemons for our water, which is nice. Then asked if we have decided on the food. The reason we chose this place instead of other restaurants in the area was the 2 can dine for $35 posted on their window. It is for 1 shared apps, 2 mains, and 1 shared dessert, but this menu wasn't presented to us, we had to ask for it, maybe less tip percentage? Singha beer and other special drinks on the back of this \"special\" menu is $5. So we decided to do the 3 course. Chicken satay for apps. This dish is Thai style, 2 skewers of broiled chicken sticks, with a peanut sauce on the side. Chicken had a weird texture, kind of soft and mushy, peanut sauce has chunks of peanuts and lemon grass, with hints of brown sugar taste and texture. I didn't like it. I had Malaysian curry with shrimp. Serving is generous: some shrimps, eggplants, peppers, onions, potatoes, in thick coconut broth, and a large bowl of side white rice. Not sure where in Malaysia this curry is from, to me it tastes like a marriage of Thai with Indian Curry, but it tasted good, spicy though, so beware. My friend had fried beef, also served with a large bowl of white rice. It tasted good, this dish is similar to General Tao Chicken. I was still working on my main dish, waitress came again, asked us for which dessert! WHAT A RUSH!!! She said it will take some time to prepare, but Thursday evening, we were NOT in any rush. We picked this place because we thought it was a cozy place where we can catch some chit-chat, enjoy our meals, but FORGET that! It was more like a factory one dish after another, eat... eat... eat.... pay.... bye....For dessert we picked fried banana with vanilla ice cream. 4 pieces of breaded banana with honey, cashew, topped with ice cream. Tasted pretty good. As we are eating our dessert, she came with the bill! During our stay, there were plenty of empty seats, only 3 tables occupied at all times, no line ups. Because of the rushed, I didn't really enjoy eating here. It felt more like eating in busy Chinatown restaurant. It would've been perfect for a rushed lunch, but for relaxing dinner, go somewhere else, unless you don't mind being rushed."}
{"text":"Very very very slow service. Been here multiple times, the  only time when we didn't wait so long for service is when the owner was standing in the front one day.  1 star for service 2 star for food"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner. It was good !! I order Green curry and Silver noodle . Very fresh and Delicious . Great price too ^_^ Very good Service . I will back here again !!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Pad Thai I've ever had. Tasted like burnt ketchup. Cold rolls were insipid, had no fresh herbs, and had spoiled lettuce in them. The Red curry chicken was not flavourful, but was at least edible.  Avoid this place if you have ever had \"authentic\" Thai food. This is a \"McTai\" restaurant and I wouldn't be surprised if there were no Thais in the business."}
{"text":"I like this place :) a friend of mine brought me here the first time.. It's her go to Thai spot because she lives right down the street. I had pad Thai and I really liked it. Good Thai iced tea too. I went back again and had shrimp and scallops. Food is good and service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!! I normally don't write reviews or do take outs, but since it was a rainy day so I decided to order from just eat! The food was mediocre nothing special. so I started to eat while drinking my soup half way done, I found something odd inside the soup as I reached for it with my spoon it was a small roach, I can't believe there's a small roach inside my soup, thanks for the extra ingredient now that I won't be eating any Thai food for awhile until I completely forget about this!! So PPL pls stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner the other day, as I saw it passing by to Starbucks.  When you walk in, it is nicely decorated with friendly staff. I ordered the chicken wings, spring rolls, hot and sour soup, chicken pad Thai, and crispy beef. Love the fact everything is HALAL! So the chicken wings were amazing! They were tender crispy and just perfect with the sauce on the side. The spring rolls were just okay. They weren't so flavourful and did not have much to them. The hot and sour soup was AMAAZING!! It was a little chilli but with so much spices and flavour. The pad Thai was nothing to brag about, just the usual you would expect. Now, the crispy beef I was so looking forward to as I heard it is so good. Unfortunately, my experience was not that great, the beef that was deep fried was o we fried and rough. It was so hard that I could not bite into it without exerting so much force. It almost had a burnt taste to it. I was so disheartened as that was one thing I was really looking forward to.  I had to ask then to take it back, which they were very good about.  Overall, my experience was not bad I expected a little more from the crispy beef but maybe it was just what I got that day. I would try it again as it is halal and they do deliver to long distance for free as long as you spend $20!  Lastly, position sizes are good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic everything! I'm insanely picky when it comes to deliver food but they hit every nail on the head. I ordered chicken pad thai, green curry chicken and spring rolls, all of which were on my plate within 20 mins of ordering. I've never received delivery food that promptly. I was so impressed by the speed, the politeness of the delivery man, and the food! God damn! Each dish was piping hot and stuffed to the brim, practically falling over the edges. And so delicious. The pad thai was my favourite even though everything was amazing. I don't think I could in my right mind order thai delivery from anywhere else again."}
{"text":"We went there because a friend said that you get soooo much for the money. And yes, you get a lot for the money but it isn't really good food. Just ok. What you get for lunch is: a soda (I got water as I don't drink soda), a choice of entree, soup and salad and small egg roll. The egg roll is all cabbage, celery, onion. Not tasty. The soup is all cabbage, celery and onion. Not tasty. The salad was big leaves of lettuce with honey mustard on it. The leaves are too big to get in your mouth unless you want dressing all over your face. They need to be cut smaller, but all you get for flatware is a fork. So... For the entrees we got a beef stir fry, a chicken cashew, and red curry with pork. All came with a side of rice. The beef dish wasn't bad, the curry dish was way too strong, and the chicken dish was pretty good. Overall not great, but you will get enough food for $7."}
{"text":"The Thai lemon soup and green curry chicken we ordered for lunch were excellent. However, the service could have been better. We have eaten here many times and lunch specials are normally available. On Valentine's Day there were no lunch specials. Talk about taking advantage of customers on a special occasion! The waitress asked whether we wanted all of our order served at the same time or one dish at a time. Does anyone actually want the soup served at the same time as the main course so that one or the other sits getting cold??? Next she parked a large soup tureen and two spoons on the table. I wondered whether we were supposed to eat out of the same trough and had to ask whether she had any bowls. I guess she figured out that she'd screwed up, so after that she kept asking how everything was and whether she could get us anything else. Nice attempt at tip preservation, but the constant interruptions were intrusive."}
{"text":"This place has really good seafood pad Thai and a bunch of curries. I really enjoyed the fast service and friendly atmosphere. The best part is that it's close to my house! I will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood spot especially for delivery and pick up. Very quick and friendly, and the food is super good!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about Thai room and their pad thai, so I had to give it a try. Boy, they did not disappoint.   Along with their delicious pad thai, their samosas were to die for. They didn't taste like traditional samosas, but they just tasted amazing in their own way.  The decor is pretty nice inside and the customer  service was great as well!  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Thai food. My husband has been eating here seemingly forever and introduced me to the place over five years ago. While it is not a high dollar, dress up, date night place, it can become a couples casual, relaxed, comfortable night out place. They do a ton of take out business and have great lunch and dinner specials. The decor has upgraded over the years but they are in a shopping center strip mall. There is a limit to what they can accomplish.  The Spicy Basil Beef is wonderful. I recently had the Pad Thai and it was great also. They have appetizers specials all day on weekends and certain hours weekdays. Check the menu out and give them a try. You won't regret it.  Service is attentive but not cloying."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and good foor. Not the best,but not the worst.  Tom yam was very good,but lacked spiciness. Good flavors though. Really enjoyed the sweetness and sour notes! It did seem a bit Malaysian... Fresh spring rolls were ok, but wish it had authentic thai ingredients. It was mostly cabbage. Typically there are sprouts and a variety of vegetables.   I would come back again for the soup and try a few other dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley by far! I absolutely love this place.   My bf & I have been eating here consistently for years now. It's our go-to delivery option- the food usually arrives in under 30 minutes (granted, we live very close), hot, huge portions, great prices, phenomenal taste, and friendly service.   We've also gone in a time or two for the lunch special- always a good deal.   Our favorites are the pad Thai & pad si ew- I go with veggies & tofu, he gets the chicken or beef. All are amazing. The fried rice, potstickers, tom yum soup, everything we've tried- has always been delicious!   Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a very friendly family running the place. Try the curry, the basil chicken, and the pad-sie-iew.  (Pad Thai is just OK, but everything else was great.) Restaurant is informal and very family friendly - owner was great with our kids. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"They have a really nice list of affordable lunch specials.  It was pad thai for me that day!  Very nice serving of soup (it had very delicate flavors, some might say bland, and it was a really nice start to the meal) followed by our lunch entrees.  The pad thai flavor was very nice - I love the very slightly sweetness to it.  Our of 5 (for heat), I ordered a 3 and it wasn't spicy at all.  It was a bit mushy - I would've liked to have seen a bit more separation in the dish - but, again, it was flavorful.  The lunch entree also comes with your choice of white or fried rice and a salad (lettuce with julienned carrots) with a very tasty dressing.  You also get a choice of soda (sorry, tea is not an option; it's extra), which is a great value to the lunch special."}
{"text":"Thai room is decent for the amount you pay. They always have specials going on that come with soup, salad, egg roll and entree. The service is fast and friendly. I come here when I have meetings on this side of time."}
{"text":"Worse than Thai Express but 1.5x more expensive. I ordered the Avocado with veggies in peanut sauce and the green curry chicken.   In the veggie dish, there were only small chunks of avocado, maybe enough to add up to one slice. The sauce was also not peanut-y at all, and tasted more like sweet and sour sauce. It wasn't even a good sweet and sour sauce, which would have made the dish bearable. The end result was an unenjoyable attempt to feed myself, 100% not authentic and would not recommend anyone to endure.  The green curry chicken was pretty bland, and extra heavy on the coconut milk. There wasn't really a complexity of flavours or heat factor which I have had at other thai places that have made green curry my go-to.   Not a fan."}
{"text":"It's a very tiny restaurant, but the service is amazing and the green curry I ordered was pretty good, bit sweet but its flavorful.  Its not traditional thai food though, more americanized taste.  But for 5.95 drink included, its nice"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, amazing food, and delicious dessert. There's plenty here for vegetarians and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"They don't individually prepare all of their food, just scoop it out of a vat."}
{"text":"Great lunch prices, cheap beer 1.50 all beers from 4-7m-f and all day on the weekends. Delicious food, every time!"}
{"text":"We ordered here on new years eve, and it was also our first meal in our new place that we moved into that afternoon.  It was OK Thai. The pad Thai was mediocre & the red curry was alright, but nothing to write home about. Scarborough is lacking good Thai. My husband actually said that he liked the pad Thai better from the joint in the mall lol! However, I really liked the coconut chicken....I was the only one in my family that did. Didn't hate it, but didn't love it either."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place via justeat.ca on a lazy Sunday because it was too early in the day to order from our usual spot, Silk.  We ordered a red curry, pad thai and mango salad. This is badddd thai food. As soon as we looked at the pad thai we knew it would be gross. So much sauce (and unlike any other pad thai sauce I've ever had...). Red curry was filled with likely previously frozen veg, likely prefab curry paste. Mango salad was decent. Came with 4 spring rolls (mediocre) and a DENTED can of mango juice... sweet.  Silk thai food (in the Junction) and Sukhothai (west end, near Dufferin) are legit places! This place (sorry, not sorry) not so much. :("}
{"text":"We found this place for a quick bite on our way to a nearby workshop.  It was a mini meal of just Tom yum soup with shrimp and an order of that chicken wings but we were very happy with the food.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean.  We aren't in that area often but won't hesitate to return to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad but it's not worth going out of your way for. It's kind of a hole in the wall, but they have cheap lunch and dinner specials. The neighborhood isn't the best, which probably factors into how they flavor their food and tone down the spice. In any case, the house fried rice ($12) is a good option with tons of protein. The wing app isn't something I'd usually get, but it was also decent. I get takeout here rather than dining in."}
{"text":"My fav Thai restaurant in Vegas. I eat here 3-4 a week. They have the best noodle dish. Ingredients are bounty and fresh. My fav are vegi, chicken, and seafood pad thai or drunken noodle (spicy 5). Great happy hour. Appetizers are on expansive side: better to avoid calamari or wonton, but try egg rolls or thai sausage or salt-pepper tofu cubes. Soups are so-so. Good customer service. On Trop & Peco, next to Sprout."}
{"text":"The one thing I learned about Yelp is that less than 4 stars means you should stay away and that makes sense. Less than 4 stars means more than 20% of the customers didn't like it and this place proves it. 3 stars means 40% of customers don't like it. Think about that. The service is ok, they have stepped it up a notch but the food is still not where it should be. The use of tofu is not an ingredient, it is a cost cutter and they use a lot of cost cutter here. Once upon a time it was hard to find bad Thai food, The Thai Room made it easier. And now they use the black non-recyclable containers full of BPA for take out. Want breast cancer? Get your food to go for a good dose of BPA and do damage to the environment, all black plastic is non-recyclable. ."}
{"text":"I used a Groupon here for lunch on a weekday and had their lunch special and an appetizer. The service was attentive enough and the food came promptly. I ordered pad Thai - the portion was large but I didn't actually enjoy it very much..."}
{"text":"This location re-opened at Dufferin and Steeles.  It's actually pretty good if you want to either do take out or dine in.   I've tried the Golden Curry Chicken and Malay Shrimp Curry and both were tasty. What's nice to see is that they don't skimp on the vegetables and they're crunchy and not over cooked.   The décor is nice enough so that you don't mind dining in.   The staff are friendly as well which doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"Great decor inside with plenty of booths (who doesn't love booths?!) with okay food that satisfies a Thai food craving.   Had a dinner with a couple of friends, we tried he pad Thai, a vegetarian curry and a curry pad Thai. Call me crazy, but I use pad Thai as a trial run dish  at every new Thai restaurant I visit, if it's good, then I'll be back to check out the other dishes.  To my delight it was decent and not ketchupy!   The pad Thai was a-ok. Not bad, but not out of this world. It satisfies a craving. But I was sad that they didn't have any Thai iced tea.   This area of the GTA lacks that amazing, out of this world Thai restaurants that exist downtown, but this is a good effort and will do for now. I'll be back to try the curry dishes and update my review then."}
{"text":"KA-POW!! Thats the sound of my belly thanking me for putting this delicious food in it! We come often, eat plenty and leave Happy, Every. Single.Time .. never disapoints ;)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Thai food in Cabbagetown the only previous option was Young Thailand or walking to Regent Park and getting some delicious Sukho Thai. Thai Room is a nice addition and I hope they last.  I went for lunch the other day, we ordered the lunch special curry pad Thai and regular pad Thai. Lunch sized portions were generous and I was unable to finish mine.  Service was great, nice quiet environment. They only just opened recently, so I'd cut them some slack as they work out the kinks.  Did I enjoy my meal? Yes. Was it the best Thai food I've ever had? No. Would I eat here again? Yes. Food here is definitely less greasy then Young Thailand around the corner. It's your typical quick fix Thai place, so eat here if you're craving a huge portion of noodles. Maybe hold off if you only want super authentic food.  Please note they also carry Malaysian food, I did not try any of the Malay dishes. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"The chili chicken is crispy and smoky and sweet with fresh crunchy vegetables. Great flavours and perfectly cooked. Outstanding service too and generous servings. I will eat there a lot now because I loved it."}
{"text":"very good curries. some of the best in the city. pad thai is not great but still decent."}
{"text":"Food looked good but the flavor was more malaysian than thai. Wasn't what we expected. I have ate at many other thai restaurants with a more authentic thai flavor."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best all around deal in Toronto. Good sized portions, great flavour, reasonable price and pleasant service.  Price being the motivating factor, this place is good because it is cheap. This is the second location I have tried and I have to say I am totally impressed. This time I have the combination plate for two for pick-up. It was ready on time, piping hot and better than I expected. More than enough food for two with left overs and only $25+ tax. Only complaints is they use those bad BPA plastic containers for their food so I will not consider them again for takeout. I wish restaurants would stop with those. Hot food and plastic is never a good combination.  It is up to us to ask to demand they not use plastic dishes with hot food. For this reason I have taken away one star. Over all a great experience and I will be back but not to take out. This place has the potential to give some of the big name Thai places a run for their money.  The décor is not quite where it should be. Both locations I have been too were dark and had a dingy feel to it. They should consider a designer."}
{"text":"I was running errands and decided to stop and get food as I was getting hungry.  Normally I am not on this side of town. . .but you know errands will take you everywhere!  LOL    I did a quick serach on yelp and the Thai Room popped up. . .and I saw that they were running their lunch specials. . .so I said why not!!  =)  I came in and was promptly seated.  They gave me the menu with a smile and left me alone to peruse the menu.  Honestly, I didn't get passed the lunch menu.  =(  I was hungry and in a hurry.  oops!  The lady came back and took my order and the food came out quick!!  (service 5/5)  I got the pad thai lunch special.  It came with soup, salad, fried rice, veggie egg roll and the pad thai.  Portion sizes were decent for what you paid.  When I got the fried rice I was thinking that it was going to be crappy like your usual lunch special fried rice.  Surprisingly it was good.  It actaully tasted fresh!  The pad thai was a little on the too sweet side for me but it was not the worst pad thai I have ever had.  The rest of the meal was decent. . .nothing mind blowing.  =)  (value 5/5) (quality 3.5/5)  Ambiance - Well the restaurant looked like it could do with an upgrade.  It looks old inside but u know. . .it was clean.  (4/5)  Overall, if I am in the area again, I would like to try something other then the lunch special and see how their other items compare. . .If they were closer to where I lived, I might come here more frequently but since they are pretty much across town from me. . .I will keep them bookmarked and try them again when I am in the area.  =)"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out because of the malaysian food options. Had the malaysian vegetable curry - super spicy! Loved it! Service was great. Also ordered calamari - which was super breaded and salty - we ate it, and enjoyed it - but it felt more like eating bar food. Overall a great experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went hear after reading great reviews about the food. However, I was grossly wrong.  We ordered the veggie pad thai and veggie red curry for $27.  The pad thai had an extreme ketchup smell and taste. We could barely eat it. The curry had wilted vegetables, no spice nor flavour, and a very bad coconut flavour.  The service is great, unfortunately did not make up for the awful food.  P.S. Please drive 10 minutes on sheppard for deliciously authentic thai food at Kub Khao."}
{"text":"I think the reviewer who said that a huge group of Thai restaurants somehow have the exact tasting food is 100% correct : but sometimes I like \"fast food\" Thai, case in point, I enjoy Thai express. But Thai express is $7-9 for a pad Thai - this place was $16.99 for oodles of noodles. WHAT. That's actually insanity. Spring roll was yummy but also $8 for two spring rolls!?! At the end of the day, we waited one hour for shitty Thai food that was $58 plus tip for two of us....never again"}
{"text":"Take-out was Average at best, I found the food to be just \"OK\", edible, but lacking any real strong Thai flavours, Beef devil was a soggy mess, Thai spicy noodle was mushy and incredibly greasy. Outside of that the food again just lacked any really good flavour. It was all very bland for Thai food. I'd liken this to food court Thai food, it was very half hearted. Servings were good, but that's really the best part. My first and last time, i will not visit again.There is much better Thai out there. This is not the Thai food you are looking for... move along."}
{"text":"I discovered the Thai Room while working at a previous place of employment. It quickly became an office favorite.   The food was tasty, variety is wide enough you wouldn't get bored and the service was attentive.   I still order from this location, though it seems as though now you kind of get a \"luck of the draw\" when it comes to quality of the food. Almost as though it depends on who is in the kitchen that day.   My usual is the spicy chicken friend rice with a side of peanut sauce (to mix in). The flavor is good, though sometimes there's a bit much of the basil leaves. It comes in a hearty serving with onions, bell peppers and garlic sauteed in.   I just ate here last night, called in an order which was ready for me by the time I arrived (less than 10 minutes later). I got lucky with the cook as it was very flavorful without too much basil. :) Just the way I remembered getting it.   I don't have many complaints about this place. It's a little hole in the wall next to the Goodwill Super Center on Tropicana and Pecos. Service has always been friendly and efficient and the prices are great, too.   The fried rice is 7.99, 9.99 if you get it with shrimp instead. The most expensive items on the menu are 14.99, though the average price for dishes is about $10. Everything is very affordable.   I only hesitate to give 5 stars due to the inconsistency of the meals. 99% of the time I have been in heaven, but that 1% really ruined the 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Room twice, and I have left satisfied both times.  The restaurant is very small, with maybe 5 tables, and I think 3 booths. Despite that, I have yet to wait for a table, which kind of sucks for them, but works for me. The employees have always been nice and fast, and they have a pretty extensive menu.  Their chicken pad thai ranks high in my book, and their prices are decent. I have yet to experiment with their menu, but it's very close to where my girlfriend lives, so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have ate here twice and I'm not sure if I will go back. I found the food not bad at all but the last time I went I sat near the back and I found the staff socializing at the back counter was very distracting. nothing special and maybe a little over priced  Maybe site at the front next time if I go"}
{"text":"I came here with a date and had a really good experience. The food tasted really great and our waitress was very attentive. She kept refilling my water glass and my red chicken curry tasted delicious. My friend really liked his Pad Thai as well. I didn't try it due to food allergies but I was very happy with my curry. It tasted great and is comparable to any other curry I have had at any other restaurant."}
{"text":"First time @ TR. Was there for takeout. Ambiance is great, big booth, doesn't have an intimate feel, but the multicoil lighting is pretty cool.   I ordered Malaysian chicken curry - 5/5.  The best dish by far. Strong coconut taste, thick gravy, nice pieces of protein. Comes with white rice and honestly that's all you need  House Thai noodles - 5/5. Very flavourful, good quantity of protein and veggies.   House fried rice - 4/5. Great flavours. Different veggies that what you vet at most Chinese restaurants. The one issue I have is that the rice felt slightly mushy, but nothing to dislike it.   Garlic shrimp - 4/5. Nothing exceptional.  But it was flavourful. Too much veggies.   Calamari - 3/5 Average deep fried, comes with veggies garnish and deep fried chips, bit they were tough and chewy.   They would also do well to drop their prices slightly. The final bill made me wince slightly.   I would go there again and recommend to friends and family.      Basil Beef - 2/5. The big disappointment. Nice flavours but the beef was overcooked. Way too tough. Management would benefit from changing cut of meat used."}
{"text":"Thai Room is a small intimate restaurant. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The food portions are generous. Everything tastes nice, very flavourful."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before we went to Trop Cinemas to see Everest (great movie!!).  We were craving Thai and my bf found this place via Yelp. Small restaurant, kind of an odd odor inside, I wasn't sure if it was plumbing issues or chemical cleaner..it was gross whatever it was!  Service was meh, food (salad, drunken noodles, mango sticky rice, sake) was meh, nothing was very tasty or exciting.  I mentioned I'm vegan and yet they brought my salad out w chopped egg on top.  Overall a meh experience.  Not impressed, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really tremendous. A tiny little hole-in-the-wall place tucked in a generic strip mall, the little ladies inside cook excellent Thai food. To address a few issues of some previous reviewers:   (1)The menu is a little confused, especially as to lunch specials and availability and the like, but it's okay, you can figure it out.   (2) The service is friendly but perhaps a little distant, especially if you don't speak Thai, but again, it's okay, they are really nice.   (3) Sh*t is really spicy, don't mess around, just ask for 2/10 and enjoy your food. 5/10 is inedible lava, and who knows what happens when you go up from there.  The curries are great. They take a couple minutes because the food gets started from scratch when you order it. If I lived in the area I would get takeout here once a week."}
{"text":"This place is really clean. The food that I ordered was really good. I'd come back to this. I'm giving this place 4 stars because the service isn't as good. I asked for extra spicy condiments and I still have not received it. I'm writing this review as I'm eating the food."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would! I called to place an order and the lady that answered the phone said \"I don't have time to talk right now!\". Like are you freaking kidding me? Obviously you don't want to make any money! Rude people and I will never order from here! I called a different place and they gladly spoke with me and took my money. Bought food for 10 people. I just can't believe the lack of customer service these people have. So ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I love this place, this is another place I usually take ppl that come to visit.  HANDS DOWN THE BEST BEEF JERKY APPETIZER I HAVE EVER HAD!! Yes I had Lotus of Siam's, Nosh & Swig and a couple other places but they dont even come close to Thai Room's Beef Jerky.  The flavor is unbelievable and the dipping asian salsa stuff is off the hook.. A couple of my friends just keep getting the beef jerky over and over and havent tried other things from here which I completely understand because it is THAT GOOD!! I also really like the Combination Spicy Basil Lvl 4.  I usually get both the Beef Jerky and Combination Spicy Basil because if I don't it feels like I cheated myself lol"}
{"text":"Great food. The lunch special is amazing you get free drink and soup. Then you get your meal plus a salad and an egg roll. All below 10 dollars. The staff is amazing and quick."}
{"text":"Just moved here and noticed the restaurant. Having served in Thailand I grew to appreciate the food and the people. Thai Room is no exception. The food was very tasty and reminded me of Thailand. The staff were all very friendly and pleased that the big white American spoke enough Thai to thank them for the meal.  My wife and I had chicken fried rice, glass noodle salad, and she had a glass of Thai Iced Tea. We will be going back on a consistent basis. As we left, almost all of the staff (cooks included) said good bye and to come back - we will!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai Food places I've had in Vegas.  Consistent.  Spicy.  Fast delivery and everybody is always very nice on the phone."}
{"text":"Golden curry chicken was good. Flavourful curry, has good amount of chicken and 4 veggies. I'd say its worth the lunch price."}
{"text":"We ordered from here today and it was amazing   The food arrived so quickly and everything was terrific. We ordered a beef salad, pad Thai, chrispy beef, mango chicken and a calamari.  The portions were huge and delicious which is important. Whenever I'm at sukothai, as good as their food is, their portions are too small. I'm happy Thai room gives you a good amount for what you're paying   We will be ordering again soon"}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. I have tried a few thai places but this one takes the cake. Although I am not really a big fan of pad thai, I have to say their chicken curry pad thai is terrific (very hot). The thai chilli chicken was also really good..very spicy and crispy. The place is considerably very generous with their portions and we actually had to take some of it back. Customer service is also really good and they made an a great effort to make sure we were satisfied (big feat considering how busy they were). Definitely a good place to try quality thai food."}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas for 12 years, and this is my favorite restaurant in the entire valley! The food is absolutely amazing, the prices are incredibly affordable, and the employees are always so polite and caring.   I've eaten in the restaurant and order delivery, and either way the food is always delicious. The gentleman that usually delivers the food (sorry can't remember his name) is incredibly polite and well mannered.   If you're a local or a tourist please do your tastebuds a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"The last visit here was definitely not in favour of my initial review. Went for lunch and had the chicken pad thai. I must say this was the most sour pad thai I've ever had in my life. It was drenched in sauce and at that point, I just couldn't eat it anymore. Not sure what happened but it looks like there could be some consistency issues."}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I'd tried their food and I must say; YUM!  I'm no expert in authenticate Thai cuisine, so I can't speak to the authenticity of their grub but it IS tasty.   My boyfriend and I popped in to grab some lunch to go the other day. There were a couple of tables occupied but they weren't busy. Our waitress was quick to help us and let us take a seat at a table while we waited. Their dining room has been decorated cutely with lots of cushy pink chairs and natural lighting. We got thai iced coffees while we waited and they were satisfying and delicious.  We were told the lunch specials were not available, despite it being around noon.  I opted for the regular portion of yellow curry, heat level 3, and a papaya salad at a level 3 heat. They aren't afraid of spice and I found the salad especially left a pleasant tingling burn on my lips. My curry was flavorful and saucy, with big chunks of carrots, onion and potato studding the vibrant sauce. It was extremely satisfying after a long night. I was surprised to find shrimp studding the papaya salad, a nice addition!  My boyfriend ordered the dinner portion of lemon chicken, which he enjoyed. The bite I tried was satisfactorily tasty. I'm usually the one who polishes their plates in our family, but he mowed through his entire box!  Our meal came with an egg roll, fried shrimp, a small salad and a small soup. I'm not sure if they were included with one of our meals or if they were just an extra thing thrown in.   I have no hesitation about eating here again. Good stuff. Tasty, reasonably priced local Thai food is always a plus. It may not be Lotus of Siam, but it doesn't have to be and the prices reflect that fact."}
{"text":"Treasure Thai Food Place Here is a Thai food gem in Cabbage town, Toronto. Quiet and Cozy  We enjoyed momentarily in our first step in. The warm lighting, painting and thai decor are well mixed.   We order drink, Thai Chai Milk Tea and Tiger beer. My partner wanted Martini first but no available and got a beer. I got a Thai milk tea with the server recommendations.  Love it. It has coconut milk in it, that's my fav ingredient in Thai food.  We ordered Pad Thai added 1 dollar extra for curry pad Thai, Fried Quinoa (great to see this vegetarian option in Thai Restaurant. What a vegetarian friendly place) big star for Thai Room Menu!!!!! And mushroom Tom Yum Soup.   Our ratings:  Food is 5/5 Service 6/5 very attentive to our table  Cleanliness 5/5 Environment 5/5  Unable to give a perfect score because the improper order of presenting food to the table. The soup came after the main courses.  I wished the soup can come first before the main courses.   It would be so perfect if this can be in order.  And also the classic Martini was not available when we ordered originally which disappointed our taste bud to bar menu.   Overall, Wonderfully worth your money to have the quality service and Thai food in our local Toronto Cabbage town ."}
{"text":"We love this place. It's a hole in the wall place near Goodwill. The thai room has great food every time we go. Their dinner special is the best, it has a little bit of a lot of things for those of us who can't make up their mind. During mango season we also like to order dessert, their mango sticky rice is oh so yummy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch before returning to work. I was flying solo that day so I appreciated the fast friendly service.  I had ordered the vegetarian pad thai, extra spicy!  Was both my lunch and dinner later that day.  Wonderful neighborhood place to quietly enjoy amazing and beautiful food."}
{"text":"I ordered Thai Room from ubereats.  At first was hesistant with the overall rating, but saw pictures and thought I would give it a try (especially since it was so close as well). We decided to order 2 appetizers: deep fried sweet and chilli chicken wings and the calamari. The calamari was suppose to come with shrimp chips, but because of delivery and being in a closed styrofoam box, the shrimp chips shrunk and became hard like plastic! (don't try it if you order it for delivery!!). Chicken wings were juicy and crispy. I thought it would come smothered in sauce, but the sauce was seperate on the side. Calamari however came soggy and was a dissapoinment. Portions size were big though. The chicken wing order was about 10 pieces! Though very very greasy.....  For our mains we ordered their thai room famous pad thai, (10.99) thai spicy noodle (10.99) with chicken, and also green curry with chicken (10.99). Portions sizes were huge! They come in those plastic black container and the curry was filled to the rim! Very good for sharing.  The pad thai was flavourful and typical pad thai taste. I like how they give a lot of meat and tofu in this dish. The thai spicy noodle had a good kick, not overly spicy. Also comes with thick flat rice noodles. Very flavourful and definitely enough to feed for two meals. The green curry looked a little watery, but the flavour was good. lots of chicken and bamboo shoots as well!  I think we will definitely order from Thai room again if we were feeling for some thai because the prices are very fair!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night from Thai room. Arrived hot and fresh in 30 min. Order from them not uber eats! I ordered a Malay chicken and mango salad. The Malay chicken was one of the best dishes I have eaten in a long time. It was delicious! The salad was also very fresh and tasty. The portions were huge, the Malay chicken would easily be enough for 2 to 3 people.  Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and large portions - come in a group and share.  I especially like the crispy tofu appetizer, but it's so good I fill up on it before the main dishes!"}
{"text":"Good food. Seriously, they have good food and the portions are not small. Their lunch is super cheap and even dinner is under 10$ (but again cheap doesn't mean bad).  Service is good. Nice waitresses,been though it's small they usually have 2 waitresses which is nice.  Decor is kinda \"common Thai\" if that means anything.  All and all very good place to have a good dinner when on a budget and still feel like a restaurant. (Or lunch) always nice to see a family business that knows how to do everything right."}
{"text":"So we ended up getting a $20 Credit for the previous fiasco when we went hungry, which was nice.  It was easy to cash in the credit no questions asked we paid for tax and delivery on 2 pad thais.  Service greatly improved but the pad thai was so bland we had to add soya sauce for flavour.  I appreciate the gesture of making it right but based on taste I would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Sadly I'm not happy with their service or food anymore. I ordered the Thai beef jerky and it was so dry it hurt my teeth. I told the waitress wow this jerky is really dry and she said well some people like it like that. Then told me well I will let them know and gave me my check. You just lost a customer that has been coming there for over 8 years!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service! I had the Pad Se Iew and it was great. My wife had the Satay Chicken and liked it a lot. The Thai tea was perfect. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last weekend because we had purchased a groupon. Omg the food was horrible. He got the pad thai and said that the pad thai from thai express at mall food courts was better than that. For me, I got the basil tofu with a side of brown rice. The tofu was so rubbery and hard, my jaw got tired after chewing on it and I stopped eating it. It was physically making me sore to eat their food. The rice was undercooked and still quite hard. How do you mess up rice, people?!?!  Finally, it seemed like the waitress was serving EVERYONE except for us. I don't know if it's because we were the only people in the restaurant who weren't caucasian, but after telling her that we wanted the bill, she never took our plates away, and went to go take the order of a family first. 10 minutes later, she finally cleared our table and gave us the bill.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Bad food, bad service. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Decor and service is amazing but food is just ok. I think their food needs to have more flavours. (It's not bad though, just bland for Thai food). I really want to support this place as it is much needed in this area!"}
{"text":"Outstanding every time! Had the larb salad tonight was delicious. Super flavorful! Eggplant is delightful. Chow mein is superb. Fried shrimp appetizers are a must have. Staff is polite and friendly. Staff will take good care of you everytime."}
{"text":"I was craving for Thai food after my Indian snacks. I've ordered the shrimp roll, which tasted like a vegetarian roll from fast food and \"oops\" I forgot to add my shrimp inside, so they put a cocktail shrimp. Basically, the spring roll was way too big for a shrimp roll and the proportion of vegetable vs. Shrimp was way to overpowering from the veggies. We've also ordered the chicken, it tasted westernized, there were broccolis and onions inside. It tasted similar to food court umm.. Thai island standard. Last but not least was the Pad Thai, it was way too much sauce, the peanut was served on the side. I wasn't a huge fan of it."}
{"text":"I ordered eggplant and tofu, pad Thai, and tomyum. Overal the food was good. Not the best tomyum but the others was good. I got it delivered and their service was great. I would definantly order from them again."}
{"text":"This is a no frills Thai restaurant.  Here you will get the basics, but from what I have had, they were good basics.  We ordered the Thai iced tea ($2.50), the pad see ew with chicken ($8.99), and the green curry with beef ($8.99).  You'll probably notice that the prices are a little higher than your average hole in the wall Thai place, but the extra dollar or two is worth it to me.  The Thai iced tea was sweet and creamy, and had a little hint of original flavor in it.  Some sort of herbal tea might have been mixed in.  I liked it a lot.    The green curry with beef was very nice, and the basis of my 4 stars.  It was basic, consisting only of bamboo slices, small chunks of beef, chopped eggplant, and green beans.  For a basic recipe with no fanciness though, the curry tasted good.  It was subtle, but at the same time flavorful.  Order this one with some heat to offset the light sweetness.  The curry was liquidy, which is always a good sign for curry.  I kind of wish there was more flair with this dish, but for a basic recipe it was tasty!  The pad see ew was also quite good.  It was a bit saucier than the drier style of this classic Thai dish.  The chicken was cooked with a smoky tasting herb, which was nice.  The Chinese broccoli was slightly skimpy, but fresh and yummy.    Overall, I think this is a nice little Thai restaurant.  There is some stiff competition next door though.  I am not so sure that this place is better than Mr. CC..."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and also their Curry Pad Thai. The view outside the window is also great."}
{"text":"After dining here 1/2 dozen times now, I must raise the rating. Had to think on it pretty hard because the ambiance doesn't warrant it. Ambiance is probably 1 1/2 - 2. They do have an A rating from the health inspector. Service can vary from 3-5 stars, depending on how busy they are.  BUT....after having the yellow curry with chicken lunch special, I overlook any shortcomings. I like curry but it isn't my favorite dish. On occasion, I get in the mood for it. Like once or twice a year. I have eaten Thai Room's yellow curry 4 times in one week... I know !!! Quit laughing. It's the best, ever.  I would say it has moved curry into a favorite dish category for me. Rich, creamy with perfectly cooked potatoes & carrots. 3 level spice has a great kick for me, while still highly palatable. Absolutely the best curry, by far. All others will have a little something off, a little thin (watery), not enough curry flavor, veggies not quite done, etc. This is the most consistent perfection of cooking execution.  I highly recommend this restaurant, particularly the yellow curry. 6 stars."}
{"text":"We ordered from Thai Room through JUST EAT tonight and were pleasantly surprised. The food came in 45 minutes (although JUST EAT claimed it would be 30 minutes) and we got an order of thai spring rolls, green mango salad, crispy beef, mango chicken, and two orders of steamed rice. My only complaint was that the crispy beef wasn't crispy - more just breaded. It was tasty but I've had crispy beef at other places and liked the texture much better. The mango chicken was just the right amount of spicy, and the green mango salad was fresh and delicious. All in all, we thought Thai Room was pretty tasty and would order from there again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at almost every top rated Thai restaurant in city.... this one isn't one of them and didn't make the cut!! Service was excellent decor very lovely . Alcohol price phenomenal for value of liquor. (The bartender in me speaking) I ordered a Bangkok style pad Thai and asked for spicy and it wasn't ... I commented and the server checked and the kitchen didn't see I asked for spicy, so it was remade. It was still a fail in my humble experience. I felt the spicy still wasn't spicy. It is was Thai spicy like I order it at Pai on Duncan or even good old salad king...I would have been happily sweating... maybe I will try a curry next time but I came for noodles and was let down."}
{"text":"We stopped at Noreen's Cocktail Lounge to watch a Penguins game and I was pretty hungry. Since Noreen's doesn't have a kitchen, they gave me a bunch of menus for different restaurants around the area. Since I'm a huge fan of thai food, I went with Thai Room. I ordered their veggie egg rolls and their chicken with eggplant entree. The veggie egg rolls were clearly not home made and weren't really impressive. The chicken with eggplant wasn't bad, but I think the eggplant was pretty overcooked. It was way too smashed which didn't make it very appealing to eat. The basil sauce was tasty though. Overall, it just wasn't a memorable meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and wanted to finally write my review! This is definitely some of the best Thai food in Las Vegas, great and friendly service, the food always comes fast to the table and is always fresh! they have a great lunch special and $2 beer special! The beef jerky here is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai place in Vegas. Their red curry with vegetables is amazing! (P.s. I recommend level 1 on spicy.  They don't joke around with these curries)"}
{"text":"Most definitely the worst Thai food I have ever eaten in my entire life. Ordered from justeat.ca and complained to them too. Everything is bland, bland, bland. It seems like the only seasonings they have are ketchup, soy sauce and black pepper. Green curry chicken had absolutely no taste and had cauliflower and broccoli! I've never had those things in green curry before. Pad Thai was seasoned with ketchup. That's it. The cap must have fallen off the pepper shaker when they were seasoning the fried rice, cause that's all we could taste. The spring rolls tasted like old cabbage and were far from crispy. Avoid this place like the plague!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been to this place a couple of times. The food is always great! I had the spicy duck today, and I hate bamboo shoots. The dish was fantastic. We also had the orange chicken, wonton soup and the fried pot stickers. The kid loved gis green tea boba drink"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped there a couple of weeks ago to get some take-out, and it was excellent.  Yesterday, we went to have a sit-down meal there. The calamari, like on take-out night, was excellent. Tender, not too breaded, the sauce was excellent; love their calamari. I ordered the panang curry; the level of spiciness is just right, but the coconut milk was scalded, so it had a bitter tone to it. She ordered the pad wusan, and it was middle-of-the-road.   I dunno. Not sold on the place for the entrees. Maybe it was a bad day. I'm going to give them another shot, and we'll go from there."}
{"text":"Cozy, contemporary, chic interior; restaurant appears to do a brisk take-out business from the constant phone and walk-in traffic. We had Mango salad (it was very mild and could have used more fish sauce, lime juice and chili), Tom Yum soup (it was a dark broth, likely made from a tamarind-chili paste - I prefer the lemongrass-infused, clear broth variety), panang red curry chicken (very good, spicy with lots of vegetables), and krao-pao basil seafood (a bit overcooked and heavy on the sauce). All in all, the food was decent, but unspectacular. Portions, as others have noted, are generous. The service was attentive and helpful. A worthy option on the eastern edge of Danforth."}
{"text":"OK LETS FACE IT WHERE THE HELL IS THE LOVE FOR THAIROOM????? The service actually good which means the best service of all time for a thai restaurant. we all know they have the worst service ever. everything here is SOLID neighborhood thai and crushes most of the hacks around this city. One of the better papaya salads the BEST stuffed chicken wing, and great wonton soup. definitely go here if your in the area. This place needs way more recognition among some of the awful thai restaurants around vegas. Archi's being one of them."}
{"text":"Thai Room has been around for decades, I would think.  Forcibly serving up a decent intro version of Thai to the East Las Vegas community.  The curries are great & the soups too.  The service has seemingly improved from a few years ago, to put it in a nice way.  They have their menu that has been there as long as I can remember.  It seems that the chef is just going through the motions now, though.  Most of the more exotic dishes are tasty enough yet nothing to write home about.  Lunch & dinner plates are available and include soup, salad, an eggroll and a tempura shrimp with fried rice and your selected entree & a drink.    The most redeeming facet to Thai Room is the good deals on lunch and happy hour.  While it wont knock your socks off it's not a bad spot by far."}
{"text":"Very good we had wonton soup and chicken with vegetables... when I feel down or with the flu I love to come here to pick me up."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here for first time. Food is pretty good! I got the mango salad, vegetarian fried rice, and mixed vegetables in a coconut cream sauce all of which I ate up. Panda House has a better mango salad but I enjoyed this one as well nonetheless.   Would order from here agin."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because I saw it on yelp as a place that was nearby me when I was craving some Thai food and the reviews were good so why not. We tried the Chicken Tom Kha level 3 and Chicken Spicy Basil level 3. I always try a low heat when it's my first time at a place. I also had their thai iced tea which was comparable to archi's (my favorite) perfect amount of sweetness yumm!! The wait was a little long but when I tried the Tom Kha, I no longer cared about the wait haha It was very creamy and flavorful and had lots of mushrooms, chicken, lemongrass, you know, all the good stuff. They didn't skimp. The Chicken Spicy Basil had not as much flavor as the Tom Kha but it was still pretty good and I liked that they added some fresh green beans to it. The waitresses were friendly, had to ask them to refill my water but that's fine, not a big deal. I'm always in this area so I've been on a hunt for a satisfying thai place nearby and compared to Dang Dee, and Thai Chili, this is the place that I will definitely come back to. I wanted to try the deserts because they had roti, mango with sticky rice, and fried bananas with coconut ice cream (all of which I love) but my boyfriend was craving sweet addiction's ice cream cookie so we went there after. I will definitely be back and hopefully their deserts are just as good as their food! :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Dinner and Lunch Special ever! The price is so good and the food is great, not to mention almost too much. I always have to get a to-go box!. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened on Steeles and Dufferin.  It's a reasonably small restaurant with very nice decor and a clean and comfortable atmosphere.  There menu is extensive and so far everything we have tried is really good.  Three dishes of note were the Chilli Chicken, Basil Chicken and Pad Thai.  They also deliver in the area, so we've enjoyed takeout from them too.   This could easily become one of my favourite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Hey, this place is pretty good! Been here twice. Great shrimp pad si ew, fried tofu panang, and spicy basil chicken. The only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is their apps could use some work. However, I'll be back cuz it's close to the UC. I def want to try one of their salads next time, and I hear the beef jerky app is bomb!   Ps. My bf would like me to mention $2 Sapporos and other beers all day weekends and 4-7pm weekdays. Cheers, y'all."}
{"text":"A pretty good Thai option for this neighbourhood. Really cool, casual staff. Good flavours and a nice setting.  Great to order delivery from too.  The meat is all identifiable and pretty generous portions for the price. Basically, my go-to Thai spot in East York"}
{"text":"I like coming here when I'm feeling greedy or maybe just real hungry, because I always get a lunch or dinner special. The reason is, they give you soup, salad, shrimp roll, egg roll, fried or white rice with your entree. I wish they had Som Tam (laos style). Also I'm not sure if it's changed but all the times ive tried their water it taste like hose water. Even their iced tea. So i just get a soda. Otherwise their lunch and dinner specials are generous and the service is great."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love their food! Sam's the best!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I enjoyed something new and I ordered Spicy Noodle Chicken after trying some samosas not too long ago.    Fresh ingredients exceeded expectations.  I found it to be very flavourful and delicious but not as spicy as I had anticipated.  Of course I could see the chilli peppers on top but I think my expectations are extremely high with regards to spicy so I luckily have homemade hot sauce in the office at all times.    They make great food that's no secret.  Surprised I hadn't heard of them before."}
{"text":"The thai room has been a staple to my family for a while. The owner sammy has always gone above and beyond to be accommodating. The food is great too! I had some friends visiting from canada they said we hate food here in las vegas... so i took them to the thai room and they said this is the BEST we've eaten since we got here. Im partial to the pad thai and my parents the mixed veggies. The dinner and lunch specials come with soup and salad sometimes even an egg roll and fried shrimp. Good value for your buck! I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for many years...We've never been disappointed! The food and the service are excellent! We typically get their lunch special for $8 or the dinner special for $10-$12. There's a good variety to choose from for the meal specials. Each meal special comes with 1 small soup, 1 salad, 1 soft drink with 1egg roll, 1 fried shrimp & your entree with either fried or steamed rice."}
{"text":"The service was unbelievably terrible. I use to love this place... But the service has gotten sooooo bad. Im sad to say i will be officially looking for another thai spot."}
{"text":"The taste of food is good. But the service is so terrible!!! I had fly flew around me. The waitress verbally demand for a higher tip. I don't have to give her anything if she acted this way!!"}
{"text":"My first time getting take out at Thai Room. I ordered the Green Curry chicken. Food was pretty good.. a little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"The Thai Room is a decent take on Thai food , the portions are good size and food is ok.  The main issue I had with the dish I got was the fact they used a ton of fish sauce which totally overpowered the flavours and was really salty. I hope this was just a fluke as I would go back there again to try some other dishes. Service was decent too.  Will go back and update if things are better"}
{"text":"Delicious very flavourful! Nice decor very comfortable! We ordered different types of noodles pad Thai, fried rice , garlic shrimp and each dish had a distinct flavour! All very delicious and the quantity was good! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing little Thai restaurant! Everything I've tried here is delicious. It is consistently good and the people that work here are so friendly! I usually order tofu and vegetable pad thai and it is made perfectly with just the right spiciness. I love the food and feel like my business is appreciated. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Tried Outlet by High Park - pleasant experience with good taste & quality food servings. In future will try the Scarborough restaurant which is closer to home."}
{"text":"I have been to every Thai restaurant in Southern California .... And of course Las Vegas; and just recently New York City. I never would have guessed that the best Thai food would be my little hole in the wall delivery distance from my house!!  Maybe they'll read this some day and give me a free appetizer! Lol . Honestly. I go to Thai restaurants all over the place! I can tell you a detailed LONG ..... Very LONG list of every single place I've been to that makes me miss home. This place is the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here last night so I'm not sure why Yelp says this place is closed.    This place isn't as bad as the last 4 reviews for this place.  But then those negatives reviews were almost half a year so this restaurant had time to fix their mistakes.  Anyway...  I came here through a Groupon deal and it seemed like others also came because of the Groupon deal also.  The restaurant is clean and looks quite modern.    The menu is quite extensive, but the wine/ beer menu had more than a few others crossed out.  It looks like they scaled back their alcohol menu.    We ordered the Red Curry Beef with Mango ($14.99), Golden Chicken Curry ($14.99), and for dessert Coconut Sticky Rice with Mandy ($6.99).  We didn't wait too long for our food.  When the food came, it actually tastes good.  The dishes were spicy but at the same time I can really taste the sweetness there.  What impressed me the most was the Coconut Sticky Rice.  The portion was huge and instead of the traditional white rice or coconut rice, they served it in purple rice (which I am guessing is healthier).  One negative comment I have is they served this dessert piping hot and it is meant to be eaten cold!    Overall, I like this place.  The service was good and our waitress was very polite.  I would consider coming back if I lived closer to this place."}
{"text":"I had their pad thai and samosas through UberEATS. Pad thai was piping hot, flavourful and just the perfect amount of spicy by the time I got it. Samosas were also really good. Will definitely be down for either coming in...or ordering in next time!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food hands down!! Anytime we are on this side of town- this is our go to Thai place!! The food is amazing!! Chicken Satay, silver noodles, drunken noodles, pad Thai, red curry!! The flavor of any of these will have you coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai I have ever had. I order the Tofu Goreng and it's amazing. My husband gets a shrimp Pad Thai and it's not like one of those Pad Thais that are made with a bottle of Heinz ketchup...It's actually good.   We have ordered from here (we get free spring rolls!) and go in to eat. We have taken guests to this place and everyone always loves it. The portion sizes are huge and for the price it's practically a steal. I keep saying I need to split an order next time but when it comes down to it, this place brings out my inner-glutton and when I can't possibly eat anymore I just finish the rest later. :P"}
{"text":"Good food, affordable food, great service on our first trip here. We will gladly be back!"}
{"text":"It's actually cheap, but Its food tastes not really like Thai food, and we waited like 40 minutes to get our first dish, a super sour and super salty tom yum!! Its Pad Thai had too many sauce which made it slimy, and it didn't have minced peanut! A really pad Thai always comes with minced peanut! What's worse, its yellow curry was so watery and tasted badly.  If u had ever tried any Thai food that was great, this one will impress you with its extreme BAD quality.  People who rated this restaurant 4 star must have not taste any average or great Thai food."}
{"text":"Decent Thai lunch spot, very affordable and the food was good.  Loved the side soup with my lunch combo.  Thai basil wasn't really what I'm used to for Thai basil, but was good and I've seen it prepared like that before, regional thing I'm sure."}
{"text":"Second time back at this location. First time the food was alright this time the was amazing. The restaurant has plenty of parking and seating is very comfortable and romantic in the evening.   The restaurant is also very clean and stuff are very friendly and attentive. This time I had a vegetarian Pad Thai I would highly recommend this dish for someone who was looking for something vegetarian and spicy.  This visit was dying in our last visit was take out this location apparently also offers delivery which we have not yet tried."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch.  They have lunch specials for $7-8 until 3pm.  Service was friendly and fast.   Lunch specials came with a drink.  I sampled the spicy basil chicken which came with an egg roll, salad, steamed rice, and soup.  Serving sizes were plenty and I enjoyed the food, spicy #3 was perfect."}
{"text":"Just ordered food for delivery. Delivery was quick. They quoted 40 minutes, but I believe the nice man arrived in under 25.  I ordered Panang Curry with pork, Pad Thai noodles with shrimp, Thai Room Chicken Satay, Mango Sticky Rice, & of course, their Thai Tea. All of this was delivered to my door in about 20 minutes!  Please disregard the 4 stars I gave in my previous review (in fact, reserve the 4 stars just for their green curry & fried tofu. Today's review is based on the dishes I ordered today, which in turn was based on other Yelpers' recommendations.  Panang Curry with pork: I ordered this with a heat (spiciness) level of 3. This dish is delicious & perfect. The blend of spices & ingredients, the texture, the heat--all PERFECT! I cannot stop eating it. I tried it with both sticky rice & regular steamed rice. It is better with regular steamed rice. 5/5 stars!  Pad Thai noodles with shrimp: This was also delicious. It was delivered, so they separated the bean sprouts & placed the noodles in foil, which was awesome. I've had pad thai from many restaurants in Hawaii & in Texas. This pad thai has a unique flavor that I haven't encountered before, but I like it. It's refreshing & filling at the same time! 4.5/5 stars!  Thai Room Satay: The chicken was deliciously marinated, & it came with some kind of pickled salad on the side & of course the yummy peanut sauce. Overall, I enjoyed this appetizer, but the chicken was just a tad overcooked. Still delicious though! 4/5 stars!  Mango Sticky Rice: This dessert blew my mind!! It's basically two huge pieces of ripe mango next to a bed of warm, sweet, gooey (in a good way!) sticky rice, all on a light bed of condensed milk. AMAZING! 5/5 stars!  And last, but not least, their Thai Tea! Like I mentioned, I've eaten Thai food at dozens of restaurants in Hawaii & Texas. Thai Room's Thai Tea beats them all with their hands tied behind their back!!! They also delivered this Thai Tea, & it was just as good (if not better) as the Thai Tea I had ordered in person previously! Cold, smooth, & refreshing (& all ice cubes intact!) 5/5 stars!  Thai Lao in Kapolei, HI was my go-to restaurant for Thai food in Hawaii. Thai Room here in Las Vegas is now officially my go-to Thai restaurant In Las Vegas. If I had to choose between the two, I'd choose Thai Room here in Las Vegas!  P.S. They included wontons with sweet & sour sauce, steamed white rice, fortune cookies, & loads of forks & soy sauce packets---all of these for no additional cost! These guys are so awesome :D"}
{"text":"I never thought it would be SO challenging to find an authentic thai place in VEGAS that actually took pride in the food they served! I can always tell whether thai is authentic by the mushrooms - dead giveaway. HOWEVER - I will not judge the entire meal based on this & I've still had delicious thai despite this.   First off - the egg rolls were SO mushy & soggy inside & had a really strange after taste, so unfortunately - I didn't enjoy these at all. The soup was WAY too sour, to the point where you can't even taste anything BUT the lemongrass. I hate when they do this because it throws the entire ingredients off & just RUINS the soup! The chow mein wasn't bad but definitely lacked flavor.  But the most annoying thing wasn't even the food, it was the lady at the counter. I asked her if there was any way she could offer a discount or make something ELSE for me since I didn't even EAT my soup or egg rolls, to which she replied, \"No.\" No apology WHAT-SO-EVER, just a flat, emotionless \"NO.\" I was beyond irritated at that point because they didn't care whatsoever about making their customers happy as long as they get their MONEY!   I also found it funny cause there were people there saying this was the \"best thai in town\"... & I thought how the heck would you know unless you've tried every single thai place in town? LOL I only came here cause I wasn't in my area & this was just convenient for me. But so far my favorite place (on Fremont st) is by far the most authentic & FLAVORFUL thai I've found YET. She takes great pride in her food. I'm happy to tell others what its called who actually want some BOMB THAI FOOD!"}
{"text":"Maybe you've ordered from Sabi Sabi, or Sukho Thai, and you think \"I like Thai food.\" Keep doing what you are doing.   This is Thai food for people who are afraid of flavours and sauces. The spring rolls feature large strips of unseasoned cabbage, the pad Thai is also grossly lacking in flavour and the lemon slice included is your best hope for flavour. The coconut curry is the thinnest and most flavourless I've ever tasted.   Also, who sends dinner for two with one fork and one spoon?   If you are really, really drunk, this might be ok, otherwise, skip it."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. It's so cute. Every time I post pictures of my food, I'm always where this place is at. It's somewhat hidden. Their food is absolutely scrumptious. The Tom Yum soup is the greatest soup I have ever tasted. The Pad Thai is always on point and their Chicken Satay as well! Servers give good customer service! However, if you like your smoothies made out of syrup then get a smoothie. I'm more of a fresh fruit smoothie type. Their smoothie is made out if syrups. Also, don't get their fried ice cream. It tastes like fried oil. Desserts are not the best, but hey the meal is the most important part!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on our way back to our hotel from visiting the Hoover Dam.  We stopped to get gas at Rebel and did a quick Yelp search for Thai food.  This place came up and we're glad we stopped by.  This is some of the best Thai Tea and Pad Thai I've ever had at a Thai restaurant.  It was delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the spicy basil with chicken which wasn't bad.  The atmosphere is intimate and quiet despite lots of people, but also it's a very casual place.  The host/server was very sweet and the food was delivered promptly. The pot stickers were good too.    It's not a fancy place and they don't have glorious decor but it was simple with good food and the bathroom was in tip top shape.  If I lived around here I would be a frequent customer.   It's also well priced, especially compared to the high prices we pay on the strip."}
{"text":"I went to the Thai Room about a week or two weeks ago and I have some problems with the food. The owner was super nice to take care of the problem . I love when a restaurant takes care of their customers and makes them feel like they matter, Thank you guys !"}
{"text":"Really good food and exceptional service. Waitress was very friendly and made me feel very welcome. Have yet to have anything here that was not outstanding. Spicy Basil pork is especially noteworthy."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are always an affordable way to try out a restaurant. They're usually indicative of how the dinner menu is, yet you don't have to commit to an entire entree or pay full price.  Prior to a yelp search, I've never even heard of this place. With its nearly perfect rating, the bf and I decided to stop in and check it out. First impression: neighborhood joint, hole-in-the-wall feel. This didn't bother me -- we've been to plenty and most times, these kinds of places have the best food. Unfortunately, this wasn't true for Thai Room.  Solid five stars for value, but only three stars for quality. (Another three for service.)  Their lunch specials are a steal at $6.95... Probably THE CHEAPEST Thai lunch special I know, considering what's included: soup, salad, egg roll, steamed or fried rice, entree, AND drink. That's insanely cheap.  I got the pad thai, spicy level 2 (from 1-5), but it was super sweet. Like the sauce came from a jar is a way to explain it. My bf got the yellow curry and it veered more towards the watery side, but he thought it still tasted good. Personally, I've had better pad thai and yellow curry, but again -- you get what you pay for. The soup was egg flower, but I wasn't a fan. The lettuce for the salad was freshly-picked, the egg roll was good, and the fried rice looked bland but was surprisingly tasty. We shared the coconut ice cream for dessert, which was a good palate cleanser for all the differing flavors of our lunch. This was probably the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"Tastes the same as all other Thai food delivery --ok but not outstanding. Even the menus are nearly identical. And the Malay curry advertised as having potatoes, coriander and eggplant contained none of these. This happens every place I order from! I think it's some kind of cartel."}
{"text":"Got the affordable combo for two... A nice combo of pad Thai and curry choices I must admit. We're at my friends new condo however so again I asked for some plates etc in my comments of my just eat order. I called right after sending electronic order so I could confirm that the restaurant could honor my requests.   Food comes... No paper plates or salt and pepper. Sorry but these things just irritate the hell out of me. It makes me feel lied to when the restaurant can't just take the extra time to make their customers happy. Pad Thai, sticky rice and curry chicken were all very decent. If you want thai go for it but I personally won't be rushing to order from them again or maybe I should just lower my expectations when using just eat..."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai Restaurant in town, must try Choo Chee Salmon (Grilled Salmon top with curry) yum..yum..Clean restaurant and bath room, new management and good food. You can bet on it, this place will be jammed pack soon. I'll be back for Papaya Pok Pok (Papaya Salad) and beef Jerkey."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, once with a friend.  They are hidden away in a shopping center between Sprouts Market (formerly Sunflower) and a Goodwill.  Service is good and prices are very reasonable, including $4 appetizers at certain times (around lunch, maybe?).   Every time I've gone I always get a chicken panang as spicy as possible.  Usually halfway through the meal I order another one to go -- it's that good.  The best panang I've had anywhere, for sure -- even better than Lotus of Siam.  Large portions are the name of the game here and I've always been surprised by the size of every single dish I, or anyone else I was with, has gotten.  I also did get a roti with a Thai yellow curry as an appetizer once.  Kind of odd for a Thai place to have such a dish, but it was absolutely perfect.    If this place was a bit closer to me, I would probably never go to Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"We arrived in town today. Beat tired. Had crap to eat at Caesar's Palace for lunch. Decided to try to find a decent Thai restaurant. We're going to be here for 6 months or so. Today we started and ended our quest for great Thai. Absolutely blown away by the quality, freshness superb flavors...I need to be careful I will run out of superlatives. I must admit to a certain bias, as I write this, I am devouring the mango sticky rice we took home. Not to be missed. The portions in the restaurant were more than enough. Prices were very reasonable. I come to this review having eaten in Thai (or at least that's what it said on the menu) restaurants across America. We've eaten Thai in probably 24 states and 4 provinces (in Canada). We have a new winner. Unreservedly, this is the best most authentic Thai food we've ever had. This is not fusion, Thai/Chinese or anything adapted to the American palate. This is Thai food. If you like Thai food, you will love the Thai Room. If you're visiting it's not far off the strip. If you live in Vegas how did you get to be so damn lucky? I had to drive 2500 miles. Oh and did I mention how clean the place is? It is. When you go try the glass noodle salad. You've probably ordered it before, so have I. You will not be able to order it again and appreciate it, this version tops them all. With that comes the final warning. Your Thai restaurant back home will just not cut it after this. Try Italian."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! Nice ambiance. Had the hot and sour seafood soup which was a decent portion with lots of actual seafood inside it, perfect level of spice too and good price. Seafood pad Thai was also good serving size and pretty tasty. Their meat is also Halal which is a positive. Only negative was that they charge for refills on pop, and main dishes are slightly on the pricier end. Oh and, the tamarind candy they serve with the bill is really yummy!!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly.  The food was great.  The delivery was quick.  I will be eating at the Thai Room more often now that I found it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pad Thai, and I'm very picky about my pad Thai. Pretty good fried rice. Amazing soup (very spicy though). Very quick delivery. Would highly recommend and would eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few dishes here, but the only one worth coming back for in my opinion is the seafood pineapple fried rice. Not a huge fan of their pad thai as it tasted pretty average and their garlic shrimp was definitely not worth it as it just tasted like regular stir fri shrimp lacking flavour. Overall, it's an easy place to grab take out, but food is just average!"}
{"text":"Food is passable but not great. Service is painfully slow and not at all customer focused. My third visit, and it hasn't improved. Won't return and can't recommend at all."}
{"text":"I'm a regular, my friends and I enjoy it all from Vina's friendly greeting to the tasty Thai eggplant, chicken & shrimp with glass noodles, Malay beef, crispy beef & more. Its all good. The Pad Thai is a bit sweet for my taste. Highly recommended for a casual and filling meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. The green curry chicken is super, the Pad Thai is real (not made with ketchup like so many other places.. why people why... no ketchup please) and the delivery is PDQ."}
{"text":"Everything was meh. I've had alot of thai food and i'm not sure what this is. Red Curry had no spice, and pad thai is so painfully sweet and sour that it does not resemble anything like the real thing.  Really sad i wasted my money on this."}
{"text":"Their mango chicken never turn me down, the portion is big! always have leftover to take out. Also tried Coconut vegetable soup: a very interesting but yummy blending taste of coconut milk & lime/lemon juice. Love it! I had noticed the mango chicken come with a piece of Orange & lemon. So to add more sweet or sour, it is up to you. My suggestion: for people who tend to like sweet taste, the taste is just perfect. Someone like me like sweet & sour, I have to screw the lemon piece for extra sour."}
{"text":"We go here all the time- they use fresh ingredients and all the dishes we've tried are delicious.  It is obvious that they make the dishes made to order and don't use ingredients that have been sitting around. We like to order our food at a spicy 5 level which slightly burns my lips and I like it!"}
{"text":"I ordered Take out and chose the Spicy Shrimp Salad and the Tofu Goreng. Both were very flavourful and ready when I went to pick them up. I didn't feel the portions were as generous as some reviewers but they certainly were enough. Curiously , the menu on the website (which is what I used to order) is not the same as the paper copy which does not include the shrimp salad. I think the website is more up to date as the paper copy had a special that was good until Sept 2012."}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my friends to catch up on each other's lives. We came in at around 2PM today and there wasn't any problem being seated.  I got the green curry with vegetables and tofu + coconut rice, while my friends got the Thai chili chicken, the Thai eggplant and the \"Oodles of Noodles\" dish. Out of the four, I would say the best dish would be the chili chicken. They gave a large quantity, plus it wasn't TOO spicy to eat.   The service was attentive and the restaurant was clean. I'd like to come back to try many of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering delivery from here since it opened, and we've always been generally pleased with the food, but recently it seems to have gotten better.  Not sure if they've changed cooks or maybe just taking some criticisms to heart and making improvements. Last night we were really impressed with the Malay Curry Chicken, and our usual Pad Thai, and Cashew Nut Chicken.   In the past we've had a couple of instances where there was not very much chicken in the chicken dishes, but not this time. The portions were very generous.  Spring Rolls need a bit of refinement. They are too doughy, and the filling is almost non-descript. I'm not sure if they are made in house, but if not and they are reading this hopefully we'll see some changes soon.  Keep up the good food!"}
{"text":"I've tried their lunch specials chicken yellow  curry, garlic pepper shrimp, Rad-Nah entree, and the very tasty papaya salad and beef jerky. I can't recommend this place enough, for regional Thai food of good quality and reasonable prices. I must recommend their papaya salad to you, try them for a very generous lunch special"}
{"text":"1/24/2018  The Thai Room has the best Tom Yum Noodle Soup in Las Vegas.  It is a small but nice place for lunch or Dinner.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh man I love the food here! EVERY TIME it is amazing! A $2 buck beer on weekends! Heck yes! The Tom Kai soup is so yummy! Very nice wait staff, looks clean, it is so small you have to go outside to change your mind, but who cares it is pretty quiet and intimate, a great affordable place to eat! Open till 9:30 most nights and they have take out as well.."}
{"text":"I came here recently with my boyfriend as I got a groupon for $20 worth of food for $10 so I thought why not. It wasn't a great idea! We came here mostly for convenience as we were going to Comedy Bar after for a show. The restaurant was dead when we got there and I can see why as the food was sub-par and overpriced. The ambience of the restaurant is very cozy though, I loved the huge booths. I got the oodles of noodles with chicken and my boyfriend got the red curry with beef and rice. My noodles were not very good - tasted as though they had been microwaved and for some reason most of the noodles were super short so it made it difficult to eat it. There was an overflow of sauce on the bottom and the sauce did not taste good, it was overly salty. I wouldn't recommend it. My boyfriend's curry wasn't bad but tbh it just tasted like the VH1 curries you can purchase in jars. His beef was also overcooked. We paid about $30 with the groupon (basically $10 off $40 with our groupon) for two mediocre dishes and two beers. Not worth it! Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"We visited the other night at about 10pm.  The younger waitress was so friendly and sweet; she really made us feel welcome and comfortable.   The food was quite nice- we got satay beef skewers (nice peanut sauce, beef was just okay), golden curry chicken (this was really good), and some kind of coconut noodle dish with shrimp.  The food was nice, just not amazing. The service is what really made this a good experience- thank you!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the Thai food here. I've given it a few tries and it usually just falls really short, especially for the price. Most recently when I ordered I got the Tom Kha Soup- coconut based broth. Some ways it's made with chicken but I specifically ordered vegetarian(tofu) Although... When I got home and was halfway through it I scooped up a large piece of chicken on my spoon. Gross. So disgusted I threw it away and was so disappointed since for a small container of soup it was about $7. I'm not sure if even the 'vegetarian' was made with chicken and they tried to scoop it out? No clue.  Prior to this negative experience I've had some different noodle dishes etc. very bland and nothing amazing. This only perk is its close to home but there are other places near by that are more worth the $"}
{"text":"***3 1/2***  Second visit not quite as good as first, though I ordered different things this time.  This time I ordered:  Thai Cold Spring Roll (Pho Pia Sod)  - this appetizer was a lot bigger (as in diameter!) that I was expecting. I'd say it was TOO big. Eating it was awkward. Also it seemed like there was an excessive amount of lettuce compared to the other filling ingredients. Flavour was fine.  Green Curry Beef (Keang Khiao Wan Nuer) - This was excellent. Nice thick sauce with fresh veggies, lots of fresh lemongrass and the tender beef  quotient was high.  Thai Spicy Noodle (Phad Kee Mao) (Beef) - I love Pad Kee Mao, but I found this version to be very greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again.  Based on the two visits, I'd venture a guess that Thai Room's strengths lie in the classic favourites (pad thai, curries). Considering the dearth of decent Thai places in the area I still think this will be my go-to Thai place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall type place, but really good food. I've eaten at other Thai places in Las Vegas and this place is the only place I keep coming back to. The flavors are consistent and they don't skimp on their entrees."}
{"text":"I decided to try this location on their second day since opening with my co-workers.  Venue - not a lot of seating and it is pretty intimate - you can tell that they are still touching up some things for the opening (the hanging lights were dusty and it smelled like varnish). May be nice for a small function. There is little to no waiting area.  Menu - Huge selection of Thai foods - mainly curries. Some Malay salads but nothing too exciting.  I got the Curry Chicken Pad Thai for lunch. Nice portion for $10.99. The curry didn't taste authentic, rarely any spices to it. Underseasoned. I had to pick pieces of lemongrass from the noodle. The noodles were soggy and the dish overall was watery. I didn't understand the garnish on the plate? Orange and lettuce that I won't be eating. The chicken was pretty fresh but had very few pieces on the plate. I barely ate half the plate and packed the rest to go.  Service - I only saw one server and she worked really hard to get the food out and take orders. Friendly service but they may be stretching the quality of service during busy time with just one server.  They take credit and was great with splitting the bill before you pay at the register."}
{"text":"Food was good. And came quickly.  We ordered the spring rolls - they were good.  The Tom Kah soup was delish a flavour I have never experienced.the presentation was fun. This dish is a must try.  We also had the pad thai with tofu this was not ky favorite pad thai I feel that it tasted a bit too much of peanut butter.  the panang curry and tofu was served with rice. it was good as well.  all portion sizes we great and the price point was perfect.  as for spice we opted for a 2 based kn others reviews but a 2 is bot spicy at all and next.time we will for suee increase the spice level.  veggie friendly located in a quite strip mall l nothing fancy but good food."}
{"text":"A more expensive Thai restaurant than most and they do a good job, but I do not see where they are trying to be more a higher end Thai restaurant and the product is good, just not great. The same goes for the service which is not anything to write home about. I cam for dinner and I will come back any try some lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great service however I hated the pineapple chicken fried rice.  It was too sweet and it had too much sauce on it.  I only ate few spoons and had to take home to add extra vegetables and rice.  I would never come back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was good, husband had yellow curry seafood and cannot stop talking about it. Our server was very sweet. This restaurant is a little hole in the wall with a super punch. Visit this place, next time you're on the east side of town, las Vegas baby."}
{"text":"Not bad Thai place. Food is made by whites people I believe as all the servers are Canadian lol.  Got the signature chicken Thai noodle and was a bit sweet for me.  Would recommend this place.  Note: A bit higher price than other Thai place I've been too"}
{"text":"We got takeout from Thai Room this week.  Absolutely the worst Thai food ever!  We told them we wanted the food mild and it was sooo spicy -- and full of chilles.  The crispy beef was incredibly chewy beef -- hard to eat -- we had a few bites and then threw the entire dish away.  It tasted like it had been microwaved and then went tough.  Don't bother with the Roti either -- unbelievably greasy.  It was not the most reasonable place we ever got food from either.  So disappointing!  There are so many good Thai restaurants on the Danforth, but this one is close to us, so we thought we would try.  Never again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on 9/19/12.  The minute we walked in we noticed a slight smell.  Not sure what it was-I thought sort of fishy.  It was fairly busy with some large groups (mostly Asian families) which seemed to be a good sign.    We ordered off the lunch menu which was a good deal.  (I believe 6 or 7.95).  I had the Chicken Pad Thai.  It was fine.  It came with some tasty fried rice though.  My one friend ordered Pork Pad Thai -he said it was good.  His wife ordered Pork Pad See Yew.  She said it was \"fine\".  One thing we all noticed was that it took almost 25 minutes to get our food.  Our food was not THAT good though.   Polite servers but we had to ask for refills and the bill.  Maybe they are better for dinner and to be fair we ordered off the lunch menu but with all the other options in Vegas I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"Pretty solid \"neighborhood\" type Thai place. We had a bunch of the appetizers (crab Rangoon, pot stickers, shrimp), the beef jerky (per your recommendation), beef and broccoli with oyster sauce, and chicken pad thai. All the food was good, but nothing really special. The beef jerky is a unique appetizer that's tasty. I would definitely recommend Thai Room if you're in the area around happy hour (4-7 every day, I think). Appetizers are $4 and beers are $2. Even the regular prices are pretty decent. Lunch specials are $6.75 and dinner specials are $9.50 (includes entrée, rice, soup, egg roll, soda, and dessert)."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you the amount of times I've been here. I absolutely love this place. Definitely my go-to Thai place, which says a lot since it's about 25 minutes out the way.  Every time I go, we order family style, as the portions are large. I always go with the pad thai, you can never go wrong with pad thai! It's always just as delicious every time.  They also have a lunch special, which is definitely worth the price! The have a handful of entrees to choose from, all of which are delicious. The only thing is you can't substitute the soda for Thai tea (not a big soda fan).  Anyway, I love to bring new people here. It's a small little mom and pop place, which always means better food, bigger portions, and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had, on top of friendly service and a quiet atmosphere. Prices are excellent for the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"I had my first experience eating food from the Thai Room, and I was not disappointed! I work from home and did not want to leave my house, so I looked up restaurants that delivered in my area. Thai Room had a friendly woman who answered the phone, took my order and within 30 mins the food was delivered to my house! The food was hot and tasted excellent! I ordered the yellow curry chicken and it was so good. I will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This new Thai restaurant is desperately needed in the area! The food is tasty and plentiful, and the decor is modern and cosy. Beer selection is good and has a number of traditional Thai standby's.   The takeout options and prices are good. The meal for 4 people is especially a great deal at $50 and includes 4 huge trays of food and spring rolls. If you opt for something other than the preset takeout meals, check the takeout menu for coupons!  I know that the food might not be completely authentic Thai, but it's incredibly tasty and priced to please!"}
{"text":"It was a fantastic Thai restaurant that had flavors that reminded me of my travels through Thailand. We have the Tom Yum seafood soup and it was phenomenal. We also had the pineapple fried rice which had a great flavor and everything came out to about 35 bucks. We were also left with tons of leftovers."}
{"text":"So, so, so yummy!  I'm a Siri Thai fan but this place is soooo much closer to my house and their yellow curry is FANTASTIC!  My husband and I go and split one of their dinner meals and it's perfect!  ;)"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you. I am Thai and I was very satisfied with the authenticity of their food. I got the Pad Thai lunch special and my husband got the yellow curry with chicken lunch special which was a great price at $5.95 plus free soda.  We will be visiting here the next time we are in town and have a craving for Thai food again. :)"}
{"text":"Looking to try all the local food options and stumbled into this place. Pricing wise, it's pretty similar to most Thai restaurants around. The pad sew was quite good. The only issue was there was too much meat! It was good but would have enjoyed more noodles. That said, it's extremely rare to find a dish that has more meat than noodles so great job there. The mango coconut chicken was also very good. So far the best Thai place in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After I placed an online order, the owner(?) called me to upsell a salad special, which I agreed to.  Then he called back again to tell me he thought I was ordering something else so I couldn't have the salad at the special price. After I told him to cancel the order and forget the whole thing, he proceeded to verbally harass me while I tried to confirm the order was cancelled."}
{"text":"Special- $4 appetizer. Your choice of Eggs Rolls, Fried Wonton, Fried Tofu, fried shrimp, salt pepper shrimp and a few more. I ordered the salt pepper shrimp with a side of rice, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"One Thursday night, my coworker and I were nearing desperation of finding a good place that delivers near the hipster town that is Ossington.  We called Terroni. Sukho Thai.  Why they no deliver, there are hard working people in this area who don't have energy to go and pick up food at 8pm on a weekday  After scrolling through a very unimpressive list on justeat.com, we settled on Thai Room.   Decided to be cute and get the Dinner for Two.  Came out to be round $30, not that bad considering we got enough food to last us until next day's lunch.  With the combo, we got 1) 2 spring rolls (crunchy and flavourful) 2) mango juice (too sweet) 3) chicken green curry (coworker liked it, I didn't think it was flavourful enough... also, the rice tasted bad) 4) Pad Thai (so good so filling I LIKED)   Anyhow.  Not a resto I'd go down and sit, but delivery is quite fast and quantity is more than sufficient.  If you're ever starving after a long day of work, Thai Room will not disappoint"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The decor is bare bones, but the staff is warm and polite.  Their red curry with chicken is one of my favorite dishes off of their menu. If you come during lunch they have a great $5.95 special that includes soup, salad, entree, egg roll and a drink.  I can't say with certainty that this is the best Thai in Las Vegas, but it's very good. For the price, I think it makes one of the best values in town."}
{"text":"great!  healthy sized serving and delicious and fast service - just loved it   would definately go back - cute little place with booths and a wide menu - great~!!!"}
{"text":"Not to mention that we waited more than 30 minutes for the food and the mandatory service charge (15%) in a table for four. The food in here is not delicious and it doesn't taste like Thai food. First, the Pad Thai is too slimy and it is not the traditional one. Second, the yellow curry tastes like curry but the texture is not. Thirdly, the Ton Yum Soup is horrible, too sour and salty. Only the good thing is the proportion of the food."}
{"text":"The food is one of the worst I've ever had.  Meat is tough and most of the sauces are from a jar at best.  The beef and chicken were some smelly rubbery mystery.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Their golden curry and green curry is actually pretty amazing. I always order it to my school and everyone always wants a bite."}
{"text":"We came to the restaurant on a Sunday at 1:45pm so it wasn't busy. Or it could have been the weather because today was super icy, rainy and below zero factor wind chill feeling like -10 degrees weather!! Our goal was to be fed well and stay warm and this place is pretty decent! We ordered vegetarian appetizer platter ($16.99), vegetables hot and sour soup ($6.49), Shrimp oodles of noodles ($14.99), coconut mango chicken ($14.99) and steamed rice ($1.99).   The vegetarian appetizer platter is big enough to share amongst 3 people. I really liked the samosa, fresh spring rolls, and the mango salad. The appetizer came with two sauces, one plum sauce and a peanut sauce. Didn't care for the fried spring rolls or fried tofu.   Samosa wasn't overly fried, good proportion of filling to crust. Not too spicy. Fresh salad rolls I would have loved to have more of that! It was so crisp and refreshing! It tasted healthy and made a great light snack and the lettuce provided a lot of crunch contrast to the delicate rice wrapper. From picture it looks like a lot of lettuce but, I didn't mind. It was like having a salad in bite size portable pieces. The mango salad was balanced between the sweetness of the mango and warmth of the chilli and there was a nice bit of acidity to the salad too. The mango was almost ripe and still crunchy enough to contrast the peppers, onions and cashew nuts. This is a good dish to figure out which appetizer you may like from the platter and order that specific app next time.   Vegetables hot and sour soup I didn't try. Based on feedback, my friend said it tasted good but, not spicy enough.   Shrimp oodles of noodles was a good dish. The shrimp was flavourful and marinated well. The flesh of the shrimp was tasty and the taste wasn't just from the sauce - they marinate the shrimp too! The flavours was good, hearty and delicious bite. The fresh garden greens, green onions and squeeze of lemon juice added texture and flavour to the dish. The tofu and shrimp rounded out the dish and made it more filling. This dish wasn't too spicy. I would reorder this dish.   Our next dish was coconut mango chicken which is a lightly breaded thinly sliced chicken in a coconut milk sauce with bell peppers and cubes of mango. The chicken remained tender and breading soaked up the flavour of the sauce. Together chicken and the addition of bell peppers and mango in a sweet and tangy sauce tasted okay on plain and simple steamed rice. Chicken was good but the sauce was just okay. Unfortunately rice doesn't come with this dish, so definitely order a bowl of rice!  Overall the service was quick and attentive. The food served it purpose and we were full!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2/5 stars based solely on the chicken pad thai ($12.99) that I had here. Portion wise, it was generous and enough to share between two people. Taste - it was overwhelmingly sweet and way too saucy for me (it was literally smothered in sauce). I'm usually a big fan of pad thai but this one was just OK. The dish had more chicken than it did actual noodles. I hate to be that person but the worse part of it was that the lemon they provided on my dish was already molding (you can see it in the photo). Other than that, the service was good - she checked up on me every now and then and made sure my drink was always refilled. The space is fairly small and the ambiance is pretty intimate... they can also cater to groups."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend, gave it a shot. Great location in the middle of Scarborough. Decor is nice, and overall inviting place to dine in.The menu is pretty straight forward matching the theme of the restaurant, Malaysian / Thai. the staff are great and went out of their way when requesting extra lime and crushed peanuts. And thats where it ends.   We ordered the shrimp pad thai, chicken malay, and shrimp malay.   Shrimp Pad Thai  - noodles were well cooked - somewhat reasonable amount of protein, in this case shrimp and tofu  - the sauce was more a curry type  - the main issue with the entire dish was that it had a ketchup taste to it, at first I thought it was just me but confirmed it with my peers as well  Chicken Malay / Shrimp Malay  -regular south east asian curry flavor, nothing out of the ordinary  -spice level was on point, we requested spicy and thats what we got  Overall was expecting more. The portions and overall taste do not support the price. Having a fellow Malaysian dining in with me, can confirm is not authentic Malaysian. Was expecting more, not a big fan."}
{"text":"With all the Thai places in Toronto, I'm always a little skeptical of the quality of food that comes with a new place opening up in our area.  I went for dinner yesterday with my husband, a bit later too, around 8:30pm and surprisingly found that it was rather full for the time of day but it was also a Friday.  The ambiance was quite nice and we got seated no problem.  I ordered the Malay curry lamb and my husband ordered the cashew nut chicken (mild).  It took awhile for the food to come, but when it did it was delicious!  The Malay curry had a great balance of flavour and had a healthy kick of spiciness, and the lamb was tender, with ample veggies there (eggplant, peppers, broccoli, potato).  It didn't have a heavy coconut taste either so it didn't feel as heavy.  My husband was very happy with his cashew nut chicken, and the serving sizes were larger than most Thai places, which was good.  Because the food took a long time to come, they proactively (I assume) took 25% off the bill, which was a pleasant surprise.  I'm not sure if that was what the discount was for but it was nice to see regardless.  We'll likely go back especially when we don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"I ordered the red curry lamb. The dish was mostly soup based with lots of veggies and disappointingly small pieces of lamb. I was disappointed at the amount of meat for the price of $16 and in fact it didn't even taste like lamb but it tasted like beef. I have also been to this location in the summer and it did not feel clean as there were a number of flies in the restaurant. Overall bad experience on two occasions and I would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Thai Room came up on my Nearby list when we were in the area, so this was a quick, impulsive, midday decision of lunch, with just an average level of expectation. ...Perhaps slightly above average. This was Yelp-recommended, after all.  The experience here was a bit underwhelming, and confused. We were given lunch special menus and then told that the lunch special wasn't available... ...And it was difficult to get answers from the serving staff. Things were workable, but a bit awkward.  The Panang Curry, at 3/10 spice level, was absolutely delicious! -- except that I could barely eat it. I was consuming 3 parts water, 1 part curry, really; it was much too spicy, feeling more like an 8/10. And it's not a matter of perspective either; we ordered another entree at level 7/10, and which tasted like a 1/10 at most.   The restaurant can definitely serve some good food, that's for sure, but something as fundamental as the spice levels shouldn't be an issue in a Thai restaurant like this. It's too bad, what I could taste of the Panang Curry was some of the most delicious curry I've ever had! I'm tempted to go back for the sake of trying that curry, at the right spice level this time, but it's not quite worth the distance and the gamble, given all the nearby, consistent Thai restaurants that are closer to my area.   Thai Room is worth a try if you're nearby, and are willing to risk some consistency issues."}
{"text":"This is a borderline 5 star.  4.5 and the only reason is that my friend said the Pad Thai was good but not spectacular.  Now, I think he might have just been overcome with jealousy of my dish so I may update this review later as I definitely plan to be back here again!  I was that guy.  You know, the asshole that tells the waitress to just bring whatever?   Yup.  To her credit she took it in stride, asked a few questions and I basically told her I am not picky and if it was a spicy dish to make it a 4.  My dish came out last and I'm pretty sure it was intentional to build up the drama.  There was quite a bit of guessing as to what it was actually going to end up being.  A nascent bet was also starting to form on whether or not it would still be alive when it got to the table.  Fortunately, everything arrived fully cooked.  I am sorry to say I did not get a picture of it because I devoured it nearly immediately.  She brought a seafood panang that was outstanding.  I don't get to eat seafood often at home since my wife is allergic to it so I am always excited to get it when I'm eating out.  The panang was perfectly seasoned and the heat was just right.  I do like my food spicier than most, but the 4 was definitely not overwhelming for me or one of my other coworkers at the table.  Admittedly, we are both kind of spice heads but it was a definite middle of the road 4.  Good nose run but not sweating.  The seafood included four mussels, a ton of calamari, some shrimp and what I think was catfish.  Good variety of textures from the chewiness of the calamari and mussels, the flakiness and tenderness of the fish and then the kind of crisp meatiness of the shrimp.  The thai iced coffee was great as well and did a great job cooling off the heat from the dish.  Like I said, this has the potential to move to 5 stars for me.  We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Just ordered again. Really first-rate Thai food. I'm impressed. I have to try it in-house soon...although each time I go by, the restaurant is entirely empty. Nice looking place though."}
{"text":"We went there for valentines dinner. Its a small place with quiet ambiance. We started with starters and Tom yum soup. Tom yum soup was super awesome!  Mango salad and fried veggie rolls were okay. The portion is good. We were two and shared everything, it didn't require us to order 2 soups at all.  For drinks there were no thai iced tea or coffee , infact most of cocktail from the menu were not available. However, the server made me a mango drink.  The good part is she was totally concerned about my likes and dislikes and accommodate as per my preference from drinks to food.   For main course we ordered 1. Pad Thai veggie, and 1. Red chicken curry. Both were good. Pad thai was yummm!   They forgot to serve rice with curry, and they not only apologized for it but also gave us 50% off on the total bill. They are very much customer oriented, the manager Wayne I guess was her name, Is prompt in following social media updates, also following all customer feedbacks and taking a quick action on it.  Over all decent food but excellent service! Kudos!  I would go back there for soup n pad thai, for sure!"}
{"text":"Accompanied by an inviting aesthetic, the food is a perfect match.   We got the curry pad Thai with vegetables and the spicy Thai chicken. My favorite was the Thai chicken but the curry pad Thai was an interesting treat. I had to give the review a 4/5 only because the curry pad Thai was quite heavy on the citrus, but pleasing overall.   Presentation- excellent.   Taste- great.   Would definitely come back if i was local."}
{"text":"So good. Our first time there - and really, we only tried it because our go-tos don't open til late on Sundays and I wasn't in the mood for Relish attitude and the Firkin - really not into that style of place.  So we thought we'd give it a try.  Started by ordering their drinks of the day.  My friend had a lichee martini that she said was fantastic.  I had the Caesar - very good - and huuuge for $5 !  I couldn't finish it.  We split an appetizer platter and Thai Room's Royal Pineapple Fried Rice (Khao Phad Supard) Fried rice with chicken, shrimp, egg, cashews and pineapple.  We switched the shrimp out for beef with no problem.  My friend polished off the two big skewers of shrimp in the appetizer while I started on the calamari, mango salad, and tofu sticks.   All soooo good.  Three dipping sauces were provided and replenished when we finished them off.  When we kind of goggled at the size of platter, the server asked if we wanted to cancel our rice. We said no,  not even imagining how big the order of rice would be.  Well, it was enormous and delicious.  We didn't make much of a dent in it - just enough to appreciate the freshness and flavours.  All the leftovers were packed up and are being worked on right now (somewhere upstairs :)  )     We could have easily fed 4 or 5 people with the two things we ordered.  Fairly steady stream of sit-down and take-out business while we were there.  Good mixed crowd - from small groups of teens to families.    Very clean (we want the alcove table next time - we're taking friends).  My belly is full and happy.  oooh - good tamarind candy with the bill. Told the server about  a tamarind cocktail I'd had in the past - she's going to work on one  :)  more happy!"}
{"text":"Heads up, the spicy basil chicken comes with green beans and bell peppers, not the usual onions and bell peppers. This was disappointing to me as I love the onions and green bean texture bothers me, thankfully my mom doesn't like onions and gave me hers. Overall the basil chicken was awesome despite that fact, next time I'll order with onions instead. Oh and the salad dressing is terrible so make sure to order it on the side. Otherwise the lunch specials are a good deal and the food is solid!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery with just eat, delivery time was fast but the food was disappointing. I ordered the yellow noodles with shrimp and crispy calamari, the noodles was so watery and the noodles was broken in small pieces, I thought it was suppose to be stir fry noodle not soupy noodle, the calamari was so brown maybe because of the old oil and was so greasy.. felt so thirsty afterward idk why too much msg maybe"}
{"text":"We went there just because the restaurant is rated 4 star, however, the chicken was overcooked both in the Tom Yum Soup and curry dish.   The 10-dollar-overprice-lack-of-ingredient-Tom Yum Chicken Soup was extremely sour, the lime flavor was too overwhelming, curry dish was too watery. food was \"ehh..\"  but the service was good!"}
{"text":"Love  the Beef Jerky Appetizer, fried Tofu Panang and Chicken with Spicy Noodle. Best kept secret on Trop. Very friendly staff and great service. They Deliver too!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Thai food and don't need it to be really spicy (the 5/5 barely makes my tongue tingle) you owe it to yourself to stop by here if you're on this side of town and you need some sustenance.   They just recently raised the lunch special pricing from $6.95 to $7.50, but it's still a good deal. The lunch special includes a drink(Thai tea is extra unfortunately, but it is delish), a cup of soup, your choice of white or fried rice, and your choice of an egg roll or salad(with sesame peanut dressing, yum!), and choice of entree. I recommend the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry.   Even when it's not lunch special time(11a-3p), the value is still there. I ordered a Pad Thai entree today for lunch and just ate the leftover for dinner. The portion was impressive.  Again if you're a spice junky then this probably isn't the place for you. This is my go-to when I'm craving Thai at work(since it's right down the street)."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the food was very yummy.   Started off with the vegetarian tom yum soup which had a tomato base to it. It was filled with cabbage, tomato slices, mushrooms and lots of carrots.  I don't like smelly food and this smelled pretty disgusting.  The Taste was magnificent full of lemongrass flavor.  I prefer a clear tom yum soup. I think the smell came from the cabbage or tomatoes.  I ordered chow fun noodles with a combination of meat.  It was season so well it reminded me of my days in Oakland California. When I could not find a good Asian restaurant which served St Louis Style Chinese Fast Food I relied on chow fun noodles because they are seasoned perfectly for my St Louis palette.  Another woman at our table ordered the pad thai with chicken. I enjoyed the dish.  Our spice levels were number one. You can order spice level 1 through 5.  My mother ordered a salad with shrimp and chicken. The salad came with a sweet, peanut and Spice sauce. Very tasty.  We ordered all single dishes which feed up to three people per dish even the bowl of soup. We were not expecting that. We paid $33 for all four dishes.  I am very pleased with this restaurant. Even the rest room was clean. I will try ordering the tom yum soup on my next trip and ask them to have a clear sauce."}
{"text":"Can't say it is the greatest restaurant ever but it gets the job done. Food is great. I love their pad thai, lemon chicken and the best food in the menu which is the Thai BBQ chicken. Atmosphere is bland, but service is good. The waitresses look awkward but get the job done. Very attentive. I happen to be a regular because it's good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Thai Room is a solid thai restaurant, but nothing too impressive.  I go to Thai Room quite a bit because I live in the same parking lot basically.  There are two thai restaurants in the plaza: Thai Room and Mr. Chop Chop.  I would suggest Thai Room out of the two.  The soups at Thai Room are very good, as well as all of the curries too.  I especially like the Panang curry.  Also try the Larb, it's very good.  The lunch special here serves lots of food, but is also very cheap.  I would suggest Thai Room if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Very solid lunch specials!  $5.95 for 10 different meals that you can add any meat or tofu to, and it comes with a drink!  I especially like their spicy eggplant and tofu, stuff rock!"}
{"text":"OK, when you are at work, and you want a quick bite to eat, where do you go?  In our neighborhood at work, we have Subways, Taco y Taco, Pizza, Ichabods, Panda, Lindo MIchoacan and of course the Thai Room!  What I like about this place?    1. Close to work. 2. Awesome priced lunch menu. 3. Ground Meat - Many Thai places don't have the ground meat. 4. Quick Service and very good service. 5. Some of my favorites - Spicy Basil, Eggplant,   They do trays of food as well.  For a quick lunch, casual and informal a great place to go. Don't expect this to be a \"date\" type of place.  This is simple but good.  GK says, not bad, check it out."}
{"text":"Tidy place with nice decor. I ordered guey jub (roll rice noodle soup with porks) and it was so tasty. It is hard to find this dish being away from thailand but they do cooked it to perfection here. The owners and waitress are very nice too:)"}
{"text":"We placed a large order (about 20 dishes) from Thai Room from Foodora, and I was very pleased with their service and their ability to accomodate all our additional requests.   I ordered the curry pad thai and added a special instruction to add extra red curry sauce on the side. I wasn't sure if they would actually accommodate the request since the sauce isn't generally associated with this dish, and we couldn't add an extra fee to our order for the extra sauce. To my surprise, they added the sauce on the side in a large container (soup-sized container) and it is so TASTY when poured over the pad thai. I would highly recommend this pad thai hack!   The food came in huge portions as well (my dish lasted me for three separate meals), but while it did not taste salty, I found there to be a high sodium content in the food which left me feeling quite dehydrated hours later.   Overall, I would order from them again when I'm craving thai food, or may even stop by in person."}
{"text":"Their lunch special is good and inexpensive. The service is not ideal. I'll keep coming back for the food but I wouldn't recommend it for service, decor,  or ambiance."}
{"text":"Went there with my family, great place! My wife had the orange chicken and it was delicious, it's actually made with oranges and tasted like it too. It didn't taste like sugar syrup covered chicken which is like most places, which was awesome for a change. I had drunken noodles, which to me is the main reason I eat Thai food. The dish was made to perfection I felt there was so much flavor that it made my night enjoying it. It's hard to find Thai food this good! It's reasonably priced and a very humble restaurant. Can't wait to return for more food!!"}
{"text":"THAI SPICY NOODLE FTW!!! Delicious and most importantly, actually spicy. Like, for real."}
{"text":"Seriously the best cleanest Thai food place!! Love the service and all the food tastes so flavorful!! Will be returning here more!! :)"}
{"text":"so I ordered from tehm last night, first of all you said you were quick, I waited over an hour to get my food, next, the food... it was hot I'll give them that  I ordered two beef pad thai one chicken oodles of noodles and two sticky rice  the pad thai was, HORRIBLE, it was barely seasoned, the beef was tough like jerky, it had ZERO flavor, no sauce to speak of, the lemons we got were browning by the time we got our food, the sticky rice, was... HORRIBLE, it was all clumped together, guys it's not hard to cook rice, buy a rice cooker, they're cheap and worth it! the rice was sticky, and lumpy and dry and... it was Gray, let me say it again, IT WAS GRAY! and the rice was dry and ugh, I have NEVER felt soo horrible after eating food! EVER! when you say you're going to be here in 37 minutes, DON'T COME HERE AFTER AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES! disgusted, dissatisfied. big letdown not worth the over 57 dollars I spent on the food. I could of gone to my local shopping mall food court gone to a Thai express and gotten faster food faster service and BETTER TASTING FOOD! the meat was that of... I'd say dog food, hell I wouldn't even give this to my dog! worst food I have ever had, I really do want my money back and fire the cook or the chef or Kelso who cooks your food. so disappointing, shame really."}
{"text":"I really do not like this place and only order from here out of desperation when I am starving and have nothing fast to make for dinner on Sunday night (because Sukho Thai is closed Sundays otherwise I would go there despite it being a little farther for me). Despite only ordering a few times ever, they seem to screw up my order every other time when I pay to upgrade my rice to coconut rice... they always charge me but never put the rice in my order. I have caught it before leaving but this time I forgot and of course I found out when I got home.  Their red curry shrimp was extra bad tonight... the shrimp just tasted off and I couldn't eat much of it. On normal occasions, the curry is still not good - super watery and not creamy at all.   The pad Thai had nasty looking old vegetables in it...the noodles were way overcooked and mushy, the sauce just tastes like pad thai you would get at a food court.  I cannot eat here anymore!! If you want actually delicious, FRESH, clean tasting Thai food check out Sukho Thai. They're amazing. Literally everything there is perfection you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Got delivery with skip the dishes because I was craving pad Thai and it was the only Thai place around my area that had free delivery over $20.   The food was decent, we got the Chicken Pad Thai and Mango Chicken. The Pad Thai seemed to have a different kind of sauce so it wasn't the usual taste. It was a little more sweet and sour than normal.  It was also kind of pricey for the two items, came to a total of almost $37 but had $7 off my purchase.   I don't think I'll be ordering here or dining in, it's not worth the price as I prefer the Pad Thai from Thai Express more than this one."}
{"text":"Just had my order delivered thru just eat. Food came earlier than expected. I had chili chicken and spring rolls what tasted really good . Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.  Not sure what to make of Thai Room.  I'd ordered delivery after reading the glowing reviews of previous Yelpers, but really I don't see (or taste) the Thai Room being on par with the likes of Mengrai?  Maybe I didn't order the right items?  I got the Mango Chicken which is lightly stir-fried breaded chicken with slices of fresh mangos, baby corn and sweet peppers, it tasted like something I could have ordered from Spring Rolls or a cheap chinese take-out place, with a sickening sweet sour sauce and chicken that tasted gummy.  The Malay salad which I was looking forward to was pretty much dissappointing with scant vermicelli noodles a sprinkling of shrimp cracker with cauliflour bokchoy snap peas peppers baby corn iceberg lettuce (???) and fried egg on top, underwhelmingly bland.  I also don't like the idea of piping hot foods being served in plastic containers, I feel like I can taste the plastic leaching into foods, also what's with the plug stating that Thai Room is the winner of the Diamond Award for Best Thai Restaurant? What authority is passing out these so-called \"diamond\" awards?     Pros:  Very polite and prompt service (delivery)           Large servings           Vast Menu  Cons:  Piping hot food delivered in plastic containers             Pricing a bit high for mediocre quality Thai Food            The Mango Chicken and the Malaysian salad are un-inspiring in flavour  Maybe I need to give Thai Room another chance and order the \"Famous Pad Thai\" next time, but until then I still say Basil Thai Kitchen still kicks ass with regards to Thai food on the Danforth.              Tip: Thai Room on Danforth is offering an opening promo of 20% off delivery and 25% off take out orders until September 30th"}
{"text":"Had to stop at bank, decided maybe thai food for lunch?  Check out yelp...hole in the wall place,family run and owned, not really a sit down restaurant with a big party of 12 or more,  but i was eating alone and there was a few tables.. I'm a big fan of curry and got green curry with chicken- it was very tasty and veggies were not soggy, crispy fresh. I usually dont eat all my rice, but the green curry sauce was so good, i had to sop up all that  yummy sauce  with my rice. Lots of parking, in a small strip mall, friendly service, yes will go back.."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a date after looking at all the great reviews on this place. Super delicious curries. We ordered the springs rolls and the red curry at a 3 spicy level and it was perfect for us. I have a very high tolerance for spicy food and always want it hotter but 3 was just perfect. Anymore and I don't think you would be able to enjoy the meal. One serving of this is enough for two people so be aware of that when ordering. Excellent service. Excellent price. Excellent food. I wish this place wasn't 35 minutes from us."}
{"text":"I ordered the following.   1. Pad Thai chicken. Tastes like ketchup. Asked for extra peanuts. Came on the side and very small amount.  2. Cashew chicken. Asked for extra cashews and there was literally 2 cashew. Y'all are petty af.  3. Red curry chicken. It was good but I don't understand why there were huge chunks of broccoli.   Quality of meat was good. Vegetables seem under cooked and too big lazy cut pieces.  Peanut sauce was fantastic. Standard"}
{"text":"Maybe take out on a  Sunday night isn't a good idea.  Our pad Thai was congealed and tasted old not fresh.  The beef in one dish  was so tough you couldn't chew it.  Nothing was spicy  even though I specifically asked for spiciness. Cachew chicken was the only descent dish.  Hugh disappointment. Prices were a little high for the the location in a strip mall.  Maybe will try again but maybe not."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai restaurant, all the food was excellent the silver noodles with chicken was so good, the shrimp garlic was excellent as well.  The only thing I would warn you about is their levels of heat and spice on a one to five , two was pretty hot !  the waitstaff is perfect ! So  friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is excellent,my coworker and i love to go for lunch. Yesterday we went for lunch and waitress was in a bad mood,never smiled at all. When waitress gave us our  receipt to pay she highlighted the recommendation tip section. My coworkers  and i thought this was odd. She saw  us looking at the receipt and she came to us raising her voice ,saying that the American style is to tip and if we don't like it , to go ahead and eat outside. I really got offended,i been trying to get in touch with manager or owner but i can't get of hold of them. I'm not trying to cause any problem, just looking for more respect as a CUSTOMER."}
{"text":"Great new Thai restaurant! Warm and welcoming decor, very friendly staff. We had the coconut and mango chicken and eggplant veggie dish. All of the ingredients were very fresh, everything was very tasty. With limited Thai food options in the area, I will definitely be back next time I'm in Scarborough! I wish them success!"}
{"text":"Just ordered in  spicy glass noodle with chicken  Mango salad  Red curry beef  Loved everything tonight  We asked for extra sauce which I think is key with glass noodles especially to avoided dryness and them clumping together in the containers  Will be ordering again  Ask for extra sauce !"}
{"text":"The decor is older and minimal and the place is small but they make up for that in taste and great price. I love the lunch special chicken pad thai. It is delicious and fresh. It comes with soup of the day, fried or steamed rice (I like the fried), an eggroll and little salad."}
{"text":"Awesome little place! Very friendly service when eating in or out! Great lunch specials and cheap beer!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are pretty average when compared to others around town. (I personally think the flavors and portions are bigger, with a smaller price tag, at nearby Thai Food To Go)  But I go there for their beautifully seasoned Eggplant with Fried Tofu.  They also have a great happy hour special which is available Mon-Fri from 4-6pm and all day on the weekends.  They offer almost any of their appetizers for $4 each.  This is a steal for their calamari (lightly breaded and perfectly tender) and perfectly crunchy and seasoned Thai dumplings."}
{"text":"In town on business and tired of all the Casino food so we drove down E Tropicana looking for a local, not chain restaurant.  This place is great it's small but the food is out of this world.  My husband had the Yellow Curry and I had the Cashew Nuts Chicken.  The waitress asks what we wanted for spicy level 1 - 5 I said 1 and husband choose 3.  When it came to the table I was looking around to see who could join us it was so much food.  We probably could have fed 6 people easily all for under $20."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite Thai place on the East side. The food is great, the staff is friendly and remembers what I regulary order, modifications included. Their dinner special can't be beat. Sometimes have to wait a little longer if the dining room is busy due to their small staff, but it's always well worth the wait. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for take out. Got the yellow curry and an order of pad kee mow. Both were delicious, a little light on the meat, but very flavorful.  My only complaint was the wait. It took over 20 minutes to get a takeout order. Besides that, very friendly and great food."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here twice - first time they substituted shocked for beef without any charge but the second time they charged me. I guess it depends on the mood of the chef? Love the beef pad Thai and green curry. This is my new go-to place for Thai food in North York. I would give them 5 stars if they were more consistent with their service."}
{"text":"In May opinion and I visit many Thay Restaurants in Las Vegas,they have a good cook the food here is Bankok stile, very teaste   Especially the Pad See u, Mongolian and the Pathay are excelent,good service and frendly staff,in teaste n flavor /10"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Interesting fusion menu, with Thai and Malaysian dishes. We were a group of three, and we were all pleased with our choices. Large, comfortable booths. A bit disappointed by the service, which we found to be slow and somewhat unfriendly."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Thai Room Management the winner of the Diamond Award for Best Thai Restaurant, that's what the website states. I really wondering what this rewards all about and where's this \"Best\" Thai restaurant located.  The Thai Room I went to in Thornhill for lunch was just a little disappointing. Services and the deco both A-OK. Maybe I have too much expectation about the food.  Phad Kee Mao Chicken ($10.99) get the spiciness from the used on chili oil and bottled preserved green chili. Be warned not to request extra spicy as it will end up to be a dish soaked in oil.  Grand Opening Special 25% off till end of September. Then a lunch special menu will be launched. Maybe I wait till then to try other dishes?"}
{"text":"This review is based on their Lunch Specials.  Service is fast and efficient! Great for lunch especially if you are in a rush.  Pricing is on the pricier side from $8.99 and up.   Food is not authentic Thai but  something with a Hakka/Indian twist. Can be a little heavy and fulfilling. That might be good for some? I did enjoy my Thai Basil Chicken ($9.99), requested extra spicy.  Not a bad choice if you know what you are getting into. Probably will come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"I have tried the green beef curry in other thai places and this is my favorite so far. I've upgraded my rice to the coconut rice and I couldn't even finish everything. The rice would probably be good enough for two people. Their servings are huge. We ordered the rice noodles with chicken and seafood topping as well and you won't be disappointed with their servings. More toppings than the noodles. Rich taste and very filling. The service was prompt too and the ambience is very quiet which I prefer. I just wish we have a thai room near our condo so I can order for delivery."}
{"text":"I came in today and the place was less than half full but the server was a mess, so lost and confused I couldn't believe it. I knew therefore my food would take long and it did. I ordered the mushroom tom yom soup to start which took about 20 minutes to arrive, the soup was way too sweet rather than spicy (2.5/5). After another 20 minutes or so my shrimp pad Thai came out... My first thought was, 'did I order another soup?' It was drenched in an inedible red/orange sweet sauce. The only good thing about this dish was that they put a lot of shrimp in it. (1.5/5) Will not be coming back. Toronto owners need to up their food scene."}
{"text":"My husband loved it (he know how to cook his favorites, taught by a Thai friend) and now wants to stop by all the time.  Priced right, is clean and the Mondays and Tuesdays waitress is super helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"We were craving Thai food while we were in the area so we decided to give this place a shot.   The location is easy to miss. It's near the back of a plaza beside a TD bank. The interior is pretty clean and modern, especially compared to some of the other options in this area. We came on a Tuesday evening at 6:30PM and the place was almost empty. There were two customers waiting on take out orders, and an uber eats driver picking up food. When we arrived and said we were dining in, they had to brush dust off the menu before giving it to us!  Despite their online takeout menu having good value combos, their dine-in menu doesn't. Knowing that they prioritize takeout customers over dine-in, I wouldn't come back to eat at the restaurant, which seems like a waste given their nice decor.  We only got a Chicken pad thai in the end, which tasted okay but weren't anything special. The noodles were overcooked and practically falling apart when picked up. For $12.99, it's not the cheapest option for padthai and it's definitely not the best tasting either.   Maybe I'll try ordering their takeout combos in the future."}
{"text":"Just finished eating there today. I asked for a vegetarian dish and it had been cooked in chicken/beef broth of some kind. It also had pieces of meat in the noodles. Obviously they had tried to take the meat out, but it was cooked with it. Horrible. I didn't say anything I was with friends who recommended it. Why not just tell the truth. I've tasted a lot better."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. It wasn't crowded when I arrived and it did take longer than it should have before we had service. That's my only complaint. After our waitress arrived, it was great service for the rest of the lunch.   II had the yellow curry and my friend had mongolian sauce. Mine was delicious and Ray said that his was also. I ordered spicy level of 3 (medium) and it was just that. Perfect...  Price...The lunch special was $6.95. It included: Soup, soda, rice, curry chicken, small spring roll, and a small lettuce salad. AMAZING...  Good food, good service, GREAT price. One can't ask for more. This will be my lunch choice a couple of times a week. Well...I'd better check the calorie count first. :-)"}
{"text":"Just ordered this. I wanted something kinda healthy. I got mango salad with onion and cashews oranges and red pepper.  Spicy beef salad. So yummy and spicy. Mango chicken and fried calamari. I loved it. Huge portions open till 11. Fresh and tasty guilt free fresh yummy food. Would buy again."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service!they got a delivery order wrong so I called them back and they tried to argue with me,telling me I was wrong etc.they also say they can deliver and once I give the address they constantly make up some excuse \"uh uh uh uh uhm we can't deliver right now,uhm...uhhhh the driver just left\" or the better one \"oh I'm sorry we don't have a driver today,because his car broke down\" all because they messed up the order and didn't want to make it right."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time and I was very pleased with the service but most of all the food is amazing!! I rated 5 stars because of the food! But the place was very clean and girls are very courteous. Good place to go eat!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here with the family for awhile now. I normally get panang seafood. The pad thai and the garlic pepper plates are great here aswell. Staff is always nice and they always remember you when you come often. All the food is tasty never had a problem here. Love it"}
{"text":"I'm a really tough customer when it comes to Thai food, and I never bother to leave reviews, but we just finished a delivery from these guys and I have to comment. This was some of the best Thai food I've had anywhere and that was consistent across 6 dishes.  Things I'm most picky about: 1. Service. Delivery was fast and correct and the food was fresh and hot. - And they said they were giving us a free entree for no apparent reason.  2. Coconut chicken soup. This is often lacking in one way or another. They got it perfect.  3. Red Curry. Again, this was exactly the right mix of flavours and very satisfying. 4. Sticky rice dessert. OMG.. Seriously, I had no idea you could turn sticky rice into a gourmet dessert. That was incredible!  Plus, I love the combining of Malay. We had an order of roti included which was a great new addition to a Thai dinner.  This will definitely be our go-to place for Thai for as long as they're in business.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, affordable price, good service, small place, nothing fancy but good place for lunch !!"}
{"text":"Came here hoping to get authentic Thai food.  Jutujak was my first choice but was farther away. So we decided to go for Thai room.   I definitely regret it.    The food is not authentic Thai food by any means. I order Thai meat salad.  But it came with green and red peppers in there and tasted completely weird.  The whole fish with tamarind sauce on the side was not worth the money.  Hardly any meat on the fish. Plenty of sauce but way too sour and didn't taste great.    Pad Thai was too saucey for my liking.  Curry was okay but nothing special.    Living in Thailand for a while and recently coming back from vacation. I can vouch that this is far from being authentic Thai.  Farrr!"}
{"text":"This is a pleasant surprise! This is very authentic Thai food (not Chinese/Vietnamese Thai)The decor is comfy and cozy. The tables are big with spacious booth. We ordered pai Thai, basil beef and they were pretty big portion. You do need to order rice for the dish though.  We also ordered the dessert mango sticky rice. It was different than I thought as they cooked the purple rice then add chunks of mangos inside, it is better to share with a bigger group as it is very filling. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"NO. N O. I don't know if Thai food is just unpalatable to me (never been the case before), but every dish I tasted here was revolting. Quality was off, and the portions were ridiculous. This is clearly a plaza restaurant. Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Crispy beef, curry pad thai, rice rolls. All great dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Super clean establishment. But the food is wonderful. Fresh tasting hot food, amazing!! Great Happy Hour but most important, very clean restrooms."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant I know so far. The food is executed well. The portion of the food is big. The price is just right. The dessert is so yummy. Serves is excellent."}
{"text":"Great lunch special and family meals. Service is fast, attentive, and friendly. I love their thai tea, chicken satay, pad thai, yellow curry, and coconut ice cream. Food is flavorful and the curry spicy enough."}
{"text":"Good service but we were the only people there.  Food was bad. Pad thai was edible but nothing special. Shrimp chips was stale...seriously the ready made bags from t and t supermarket is way better. I have had a lot of peanut sauce at so many restaurants and this place cant make peanut sauce. You are a thai restaurant for god sakes! Beef dish was brutal. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Just ordered a veggie lovers combo from Thai Room for deliverty. I sent the order in on Just Eat, and 2 minutes later I called to make a substitution of red curry for green curry. They said that they had already sent out my order, which was impossible because I had sent it in exactly 2 minutes before. ONE HOUR LATER, we still had not been delivered our meal. I called and asked where it was, and they said that there had been a system error and they just received the order now. I asked them to substitute the red for green curry again, but I was placed on hold indefinitely. The food arrived eventually, and it was ATROCIOUS. The red curry was a sickly yellow colour and was virtually tasteless. The vegetables in the pad thai were limp and brown. The spring rolls were inedible-truly deplorable. If you plan on enjoying some nice takeout on a Friday night, DO NOT ORDER FROM THAI ROOM. You will be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai spot! Great service and even better happy hour. Spicy is on a 1-5 level 5 will set you on fire! Best food to recover from a weekend of partying in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"i love there chicken fried rice +extra vegie."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai and chicken cashew along with veg \"fresh\" spring roll. The spring rolls were old and refrigerated. The skin was thick and hard. Not impressed at all. The pad Thai came out very saucy and it tasted like ketchup. Huge lumps of beef and not very tasty. The chicken cashew was decent but probably because of all the soy sauce.  I'd stay away from here. For a total of 40$ the food was very bad. Should have went with a different place all together."}
