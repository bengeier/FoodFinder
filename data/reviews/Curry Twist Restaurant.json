{"text":"Was At Curry Twist about two weeks ago. The food was very good. Its a small location and the majorty of tables are at the back but its nicely decorated. Not too chinzy like some places tend to be. 
the server was very nice. I asked for a special order and they were happy to make it for me. The food did take a little time but that could have been because of my special order so I cant complain about that.  It was delicious though. I will say that when we first sat down they  gave us poppadums but no chutney to  eat with it-so they were a little dry. I think its their way to make a few dollars by having you buy the chutney. Rice does not come with your meal either. The price was a little deep i thought for not havng those extras ($35 , no drinks) but truth is I would go back because it was good !!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a frigid night.  We asked to sit away from the door and the lovely server took us right to the back! Awesome.  
We ordered the Chicken Xacutti (a special) and Vegetable Paneer for our mains and bread rolls as an appetizer.  The food was delicious, with just the right amount of spice.  Everyone who works there is very gracious and lovely to interact with.  They were very attentive and brought lots of water.   They have really cool old freezer at the back of the seating area that I'm coveting."}
{"text":"Curry Twist is, so far, my favorite restaurant in the Junction. Every dish I've had was tasty and pleasantly presented. The service is friendly and low-key, i.e., not overbearing. Really couldn't ask for a much better experience in this neighborhood resto."}
{"text":"I have been coming to curry twist for the last several years, and I can honestly say  the quality of food is exceptional and extremely flavorful!
I needed a specific Indian meal which was not on the  menu for an event and the owner gladly catered to my needs. Everyone was extremely impressed.
Besides their food, the service and hospitality are wonderful."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim and we were definitely impressed. Service was quick and food was tasty. The portion sizes were on the small side but i would still recommend the food here. The use a naan oven and it comes out fresh.  We ended up getting 4 veggie entrees and they had a samosa special but they weren't great samosa. All in all i would come back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Decent Indian fare in the Junction. We were seated pretty quickly on a busy Sunday evening and service was friendly and efficient. Not a huge variety of meat dishes to choose from but our butter chicken was great. The aloo gobhi was my favorite - lots of cauliflower which other places normally skimp on!"}
{"text":"I love Curry Twist! It's my favourite Indian food in Toronto.  Also, they have the best pappadums I have ever tasted.  The only thing is I would warn is their butter chicken is sweeter than most, although I don't like butter chicken as it is.  Wonderful, flavourful dishes all around."}
{"text":"I travel to India often so I have become quite picky about my Indian food.  The food here is always fresh, not too greasy, and flavourful. Sometimes they use a bit more salt that I'd like, but when I remember to ask, they cut back.  The service is great too!  I've eaten here about 8 times now, and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The food is amazing and the owner is always there to say Hi and is extremely friendly! This goes a long way...
 It's nice being able to see them cook everything right at the front of the restaurant. The service is excellent also. Channa Masala and Saag Paneer ...so good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a lot of promise since I had take out of their saag paneer which was great. I decided to go with a friend to dine in last night.  The portions were ridiculous for apps...we ordered chicken saffron tikka I think..and it was mostly vegetables, ie. onions and cabbage...so paying $10 for onions and cabbage is not really how indian food works I'm from the subcontinent.  There should have been at least 5 cubes of decent size chicken pieces which wasn't so...we ordered the maachi tikka (salmon) and again the same thing...for $11 you get three TINY pieces of salmon on some massive onions and cabbage. Is it really appropriate for us to pay that much for veggies? I expected at least 4 good size pieces..so like $2 per salmon piece or something....Again, disappointed. Taste of chicken was better than salmon but not like the saffron chicken tikka I remember.   Next we ordered, eggplant since we weren't eating carbs that day and my mom makes the most delish eggplant burta so I was ready for some delish eggplant! The portion was small again and the taste was too much garam masala or something.  One spice was way too much and the spices were not integrated together as they should be if properly made.  So again disappointed.  Had Lamb Curry/Korma and again not enough lamb and they stuffed a bit with potatoes....so will probably not go back but I think for Cauasians since they may not what is missing will think its ok. But my friend was Cauasian and he felt the same way that I did about the food. We weren't impressed and they could do better. They also only had one server for the whole restaurant and that was not right. Either they do that to make you feel bad for the server since he's so stretched or that they don't want to pay other servers so service is better. We also waited a while for our food and it was basically only apps that we ordered. They need lemon on their tikkas or dry foods which they didn't serve. Lemon is staple in indian food as a garnish for most dishes."}
{"text":"I wish I had better things to say about this place as we were really excited to try it out after blog TO listed it as one of the best Indian restaurants in the city. We went for my partner's birthday dinner and it was very disappointing. To start off they were out of the reasonably priced Kim Crawford, however the server was very apologetic and accommodating. 

We ordered samosas as our appetizer which were good but nothing exceptional. We then ordered 4 curries, 3 vegetarian ones and the famous Lamb Madras. All of the vegetarian curries were bland and lackluster. My partner really enjoyed the lamb however and it seemed to be the only dish with real flavour. The garlic naan was good.

The decor is nothing special and we were seated at the back near a large fridge with loud humming. The tables near the front window appear to be a bit better though. Despite the good service, the food is not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This is a cozy Indian restaurant, packed with lots of customers on a Sunday night.

We ordered the saag paneer, lamb madras, samosa, and sheekh kebab for the two of us.

The samosa was fresh and not too oily. Just the right amount of seasoning. 

The paneer and lamb dishes come in one person size dishes. While both main dishes were delicious, it definitely wasn't enough for the two of us to share, which is fine since we have big appetites. Very well seasoned and balanced.

The sheekh kebab was a little more heavily seasoned and spicy compared to the other dishes. 

Overall, reasonable prices for delicious foods in this part of the city. Just be prepared to wait as they are really busy and they do the best they can."}
{"text":"This is the best, most flavorful Indian food I have ever had! 
A MA ZING!
Can't wait to come back for more :)"}
{"text":"Solid Indian food and very nice and helpful staff! Liked the butter chicken and the fresh garlic naan. Had it for take away and it was still hot 1.5 hours later! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Do not miss this place if you're visiting Toronto! We ordered the butter chicken and lamb twist masala! Both amazingly good!! Even ordered some rice to eat with the left over chicken later. Friendly, fast service! 15 mins drive from downtown.. not bad at all given the traffic in the city. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food.  A nice amount of heat, but not over powering.  Would highly recommend to anyone.  Great service and quick."}
{"text":"???????????????

???????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Curry Twist. The food was great and the atmosphere was relaxed. The staff was very helpful - I would go back."}
{"text":"When you think The Junction you don't think Indian food. But I have to say this place is one of the best outside of Brampton. If you're in the west end it is a must. Fantastic veggie and meat dishes."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now and Curry Twist has consistently had the best Indian food in Toronto.  My mom and I ordered the veggie samosas to start, followed by the Daal Amritsari, the Lamb Madras, na'an and rice.  

The samosas were slightly underwhelming compared to the rest of the dish but still very good.  The main however was amazing, our waiter suggested the lamb since it was his favorite and it did not disappoint, so flavorful, smooth and delicious- similar story for the Daal.  The na'an was so light and fluffy and amazing! I don't know how they do it.  

Portions look small at first glance but we ended up taking about a third of our meal home with us!

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was so excited to order from here after all of the amazing reviews. I am in disbelief at how tasteless the food was!  We ordered the butter chicken and the dal. Both dishes lacked the flavor of Indian cuisine. Both were bland and we were so incredibly disappointed. The garlic nan was the best part of our meal.  Really too bad as we live close by and thought the prices were reasonable. Maybe they had an off night?  Will still never return. Bukhara grill or Chutneys are much better options"}
{"text":"Our first Indian Restaurant experience in the neighbourhood. The place is very quaint and the food a treat for your senses. Loved the Bard's gluten free beer selection with the chicken curry. And because I love spicy food I appreciated their fresh green chillies that were very spicy. Also to mention the experience would not have been the same without the great service."}
{"text":"Juat recently had a guy's night out at this restaurant (Tuesday). Tasty dinner. We took advantage of the two specials of the day. Service was great and friendly. We got seated at the great tables at the front. Nice way to start an evening before we hit Margrets for late night drinks. Recommended."}
{"text":"Grew up eating Indian food and have travelled throughout India.  Curry Twist is notable for its very fast and friendly service, delicious fresh breads and fair prices.  In many dishes, you can taste each individual spice.  Their open kitchen and careful prep inspires confidence, and an order of delicious food can be at your table in five minutes, a refreshing change from long waits for fresh Indian food.  Ask for the lamb vindaloo (not on the menu).  My favourite Indian place (though Tandoori Flame has its moments)."}
{"text":"I love Curry Twist.  There are only a couple of good curry houses in Toronto and this is one of them. Having said that, I only like certain items on the menu. Lamb Madras, garlic naan, saag paneer washed down with a glass or two of Gewürztraminer. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ate at the Curry Twist for the first time. Enjoyed the veggie and non-veg entrees. Aloo tikki reminded me of my mom's aloo tikki. The Laccha parantha was lovely too and so were the chicken dishes. Loved the ambience and were so glad we had a chance to eat at this divine place at the Junction. The chef was wonderful and so was the staff. 5 stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"WOOOO I love this place!

This was my first time going to an indian restaurant and it was great! I was most excited to try their garlic naan, cause 1. i love garlic 2. i LOVE naan! So it was good

$3 for their garlic naan but it's quite big

average curries were about $12/13 but it was really filling. The dish they serve it in makes it look small, but apparently its a bottomless dish.

The service is nice, the place is clean. Overall I will def come back here for my indian food fix"}
{"text":"I've gone to Curry Twist a few times since I moved into the Junction back in June 2011. I've enjoyed it each time... which explains why I keep going back, hah! They often have a lineup to get in on Friday and Saturday nights, so keep that in mind if you want to go, especially if you've got a group of friends coming with you.

Service is friendly but not overbearing - they happily recommend dishes to order, amounts of rice to get, and all that, but they don't lurk near your table constantly either. Spice levels here are fairly mild, so if you're a spice fan, you might want to ask for your dish to be done hotter. 

Favourite dish so far: the Baigan Bharta. 

For the vegans out there: there are a number of vegan-friendly dishes on the menu, so you can stick this place on your roster of places to go with non-vegan friends and family."}
{"text":"In search of the best Indian food in Toronto, my mom and I decided to try Curry Twist after having driven past it the day before we went to eat there. A humble venue with pleasant decor and aromatic scents. 

We ordered the naan which was hot and fresh, an aloo dish,  the butter chicken, and lamb madras. All extremely fresh-tasting and flavorful with moist meat. The portions seem small as they come in fancy little silverware but don't be fooled -- the small pots seem like they're bottomless. We shared our dishes and left so satisfied. And the service was great too--the young men who served us were nice and attentive so thanks to them for a good first experience as well!

Will definitely go again (if only I lived closer to the junction)!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Curry Twist!  Anything I have gotten from here-either take-out or dine-in- has been fresh, delicious, and well-priced.  One of my favourite restaurants in the city!  The staff welcome you with smiles and warm greetings.  A definite must-try!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" Indian restaurant on the west side of the city.  Right up there with best in the city if you ask me. Their curry chicken and butter chicken are amazing!  The authentic home made garlic naan is top notch.  Service is always great! Super friendly staff.  Always a pleasure when eating in or take out. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For sure the best food in the junction. I see a good restaurant when the owner is in front of the stove. Great food great service."}
{"text":"Figured I was in the area tonight so I would try something different in the area. First off I love Indian food but this take out was nothing what I expected and have had in the city. $12.95 got you no chicken (5 chunks) with LOTS OF SAUCE good customer service but with Roti it was just under $18.00. Not worth it. It's like having a soup dish."}
{"text":"The Good:

Nothing that I can note.

The Bad:

1. mediocre food
2. small portion size
3. burned appetizer
4. pricy for what we ordered

Conclusion:

Try Banjara at Christie."}
{"text":"We order take out from this restaurant and it is fantastic.  I hate when restaurants use sketchy pieces of chicken in their dishes - this is NOT at all the case here.  The garlic nan is amazing!  I recommend!"}
{"text":"This cozy, inviting place on Dundas in the Junction will seduce you with incredible aromas the moment you walk in, as the open kitchen is right near the front.  Each time we've gone, we've ordered at least one of the 'daily specials', and we've  been wowed each time.
The staple menu items are some of the best indian i've had. All I've tried have a fresh take and very full flavoured. The fresh naan is fabulous, and the pappadum appetizers disappear very quickly too."}
{"text":"Best Indian in the city in my opinion, won't eat it anywhere else! Have been coming here for 10 years now, and it is my favourite spot to bring friends. So far everyone has loved it and come back again with and without me, bringing their friends too! Every dish has its own unique flavour. I love the saag paneer, daal palak and channa masala. The fish magic is so tasty and quite mild, and the Goan fish curry is a unique and delicious taste when I want something spicier. Not a meat eater so I can't comment on the meat dishes. A real neighbourhood place with friendly service and genuine care. The chef greets everyone from the kitchen and is all smiles."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice, but the food took a long time without any explanation. The dishes we ordered were less flavourful than I expected, the spices were bland. We packed up the rest of our meal, but our two curries were mixed in the same takeout box and the large order of naan was entirely missing from our takeout. For the price, I definitely expected more."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and was happy both times. The flavours are fresh, strong and unique. Also, the naan is right out of the oven. Service was good and prompt. 

I saved some cash by ordering vegetarian dishes only, which worked out well."}
{"text":"A wonderful fixture within the Junction neighbourhood, offering up strong dishes that deliver on authenticity and flavour. Having dined in as well as ordered take-out on multiple occasions, I can attest to the consistency of great quality food and customer service.

The only noticeable caveat, with regard to the dishes, would be that the portion sizes are quite petite. Case in point: On the last visit, one of the wait staff decided to upsell Samosas to our table--which we ultimately agreed to--but honestly had an average taste and only were there two of them. For a pair of diners, I would certainly recommend sharing the Goan Fish Curry, Butter Chicken, Daal Amritsari and Naan Bread. 

Additionally, it ought to be mentioned that the interior layout and space are on the tighter end and may be found to be claustrophobic and noisy as a result. NOTE: If possible, stay away from the very back as seating is immediately next to their commercial fridges--really noisy, indeed--and staff will occasionally retrieve items from it."}
{"text":"My favourite Toronto restaurant so far!

I had something that was super delicious, called a Butter Paneer, which is Indian cheese (like a very mild mozzarella) in butter chicken sauce. It was sooo good. Had to order the rice and naan separately (they're not included in the order of meat/curry) but it was well worth it. The naan was super soft and buttery.

There were samosas on special which we big and full of delicious. I was sad to know they weren't on the main menu. I was also hoping for pekoras but I didn't see them either.

On a side note, the main clientele at the time was dressed a little fancier than I'm used to, and ofttimes a touch rude to the waitress who was very good at keeping polite.

Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in the junction. I would recommend it to anyone vegetarian. This restaurant has a good selection of vegetarian food
which is very flavorful and well spiced yet not too heavy. 

The stand-out though is the service which is excellent. They have the friendliest staff. They're all smiles and are very helpful and efficient. This is a neighborhood restaurant where you can really feel at home.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Favourite Indian in the city if not the world. Just moved out of the Junction to the west end and glad that I can get take out through door dash as my local option in Etobicoke doesn't hold a candle to this. The complexities of the flavours of any dish will not disappoint, plus service is great and after eating here or ordering takeout about 25 times I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The décor is nice and the staff are so friendly. The food is so yummy as well. I have had the following: Paneer Veggie Twist, Channa Masala, Paneer Makhani, Samosas, Mango Ice Cream, and Rasmalai. The paneer dishes were so tasty. The paneer was nice and tender. The channa masala had the right amount of spice and was delicious. The mango ice cream was my favorite dessert. You can tell they made it themselves and not store bought. I am coming back again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great indian food. Not your typical butter chicken that you order in other indian restaurant. The butter chicken at curry twist has a slightly more tomato taste which makes it great. The lamb is always good. Not to forget about the fresh naan. This is our go to place for indian food."}
{"text":"We had takeout from them and it was very solid.  For Indian in the neighbourhood, this is the place to go to for us as North of Bombay was terrible (sadly)."}
{"text":"They have the beset indian food I have had in Toronto.   The staff are great and the place is nice.  I think anyone who likes Indian food must try this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food and incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff! Ordered the flounder curry; it was full of flavor and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Incredible food, and very friendly & efficient service.
Cheap prices are a great plus as well!

Been here a few times, and always look forward to our next visit.

Aloo Gobi , and Lamb Curry are my faves here."}
{"text":"I've been to Curry Twist many times and it is and remains my favourite Indian food restaurant in the GTA so far. 

The atmosphere is really intimate and comfortable which makes it perfect for dates but not necessarily suited to a huge party without a reservation.

The service is always excellent and the staff always gives fabulous recommendations if you're not sure what to order or want to try something new.

The FOOD. I guess this is the main point people would be reading this. This is the best Indian food in Toronto (I don't work for them, pinky swear). My boyfriend and I are spice-addicts and have been to almost every Indian place on Queen Street. The Lamb Achari is what I had last time and I think it's taken the place as one of my favourite Indian dishes!

. This is still my favourite, the flavours are so authentic, the portions are just ride and it's served piping hot.

I'd highly recommend this place, it's worth the trip to Dundas West."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing all around. 

The veggie samosa....they are no Samosa King. This triangle bundle had a very thick exterior and may(?) have been microwaved. 

The naan....its no Mela. The toasty carb was bland, boring, thin and dry. 

The curry twist chicken was lacking in intensity and depth. The chicken was cooked prior to being added to the weak sauce. How do I know it was cooked prior? Cause I saw dude walk through the restaurant with a tub that had 2 Ziploc freezer bags with the orange coloured chicken cubes in it. The prep area for this joint is in the front. This alone firmed up my decision that I will not return. 

I also saw him bring to the front saran wrap encased dishes with rice in them....ready for the microwave?! 

Bringing partially prepared food out through the restaurant, in my opinion, is a complete turn off. It is like going on a date and the guy is rude and talks to the waiter like they are stupid. 

The channa was meh....really, that three letter word sums up this place for me. It truly lacked authenticity, and felt very westernized. 

My hunt for a great one stop Indian restaurant continues...."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed after a meal at curry twist. I highly recommend their butter chicken. There a soft sweet heat of flavours that dance across your taste buds as you dip your made to order naan bread in the sauce. Curry Twist's butter chicken sets a pretty high standard for me as it is the best butter chicken I've had. The curry chicken is also good. But be careful if you can't handle spicy there is a bit if a kick to it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at most of Toronto's historical Indian Hot spots and had a chance to eat at Curry Twist last night.  It's a small operation -there were 2 cooks in the kitchen and a single server for the whole restaurant.  Has a quaint feel and everyone is VERY friendly (how often do you go into a restaurants and have the cooks greet you while they are cooking?).  Service was top notch but the food was what really stood out.  In short, everything felt \"gourmet\", as if it had that extra little bit of care and thought put into it to make it taste just right.  Had the butter chicken and my girllfriend (vegetarian) had the butter paneer -basically the vegetarian equivalent of Butter Chicken. We both thought it was fantastic and would rate it among the top spots in and around the city for Indian food.  We also had the pilau (rice) and of course Naan -both of which were top notch.  The price was very reasonable to boot -around $40 for the pair of us to eat well, including tax and tip.  We were impressed and will  be going back."}
{"text":"We come to this place quite often and we loved their vegetarian curries. Naan is very good and the service and environment is nice, tho their butter chicken is suuuuuper sweet and for me is on the edge of impossible to eat. Might come back only for veggie options."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian restaurant with fresh food that is being cooked fron fresh daily. Lots of vegetarian options. clean and very friendly."}
{"text":"Really nice food here for curry fans. There is often a huge line up."}
{"text":"Before I start, I must admit this review is late, very late in fact. I half wrote this when I first went to Curry Twist in September 09, then edited more in October, repeated in November and decided to fully rewrite now.

So really, this is an entirely new review about a restaurant I've come to love after living in the Junction for the past few months. A restaurant I've been to at least 5 times now, sharing dishes with gleeful abandon with my dining companions and comparing our dishes.

Quick reviews: The Butter Chicken is divine, with flavourful mouthfuls of a buttery, savoury chicken that is full of sweet spice and flavour. The Lamb Madras is thick, hearty and spicy, perfect for a bitter cold Canadian winter. The Fish Magic is a simple, flaky fillet in one of the most succulent sauces I could imagine, what sauce did not soak up the fillets went directly onto my naan bread and was devoured. The Haandi Chicken Twist is one of the spicier things on the menu and is also a favourite of mine. 

Their specials are often quite fantastic and the next time I see a biryiani on the board I will just stop in for dinner whether I was planning to or not.

Top it off with a gigantic Naan bread or a generous dish of vegetable pulao rice and a bottle of Blanche de Chambly and/or the Hardy's Gewurztraminer from Australia and you will be as hooked as I am.

I promise."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The meal started with day old stale pappdums and finish with flavour less, watered down saag paneer and under cooked, bland chicken Korma. We decided not to finish the meal and instead took our appetite to another Indian restaurant down the street. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I walked in to this restaurant on a late friday evening and with slight reluctance they invited us to have a seat. Though the restaurant was small, they were busy. Since we were late, we had to order all at once and were pretty impressed with the taste. We had ordered Tawa Paneer for starter, and had Baigan Bharta and Paneer Vege Twist and Naan for the main course. The Baigan Bharta was just outstanding and the best ever i have had. The Vege twist was a bit watery and could have been a bit thicker. The Naan was made of whole wheat unlike most other restaurants was perfect. I felt it was expensive as it costed us $50 for a meal for 2 which also included mango lassi. Over all very impressed with the taste and would recomend to go here.."}
{"text":"My friends M&H come here as they are a short drive from the Junction; when they suggested we go here for dinner last Saturday night, I was in.  

This is a more upscale Indian restaurant.  There is no buffet.  We enjoyed 2 apps, 3 dishes and naan plus 3 drinks for about $100.  The food has a good homemade taste to it and was a bit different than what might be called the \"generic\" dishes you get everywhere else.  (Not that there is anything wrong with generic butter chicken!)  

Personally I was more impressed with the spinach and cheese than with the lamb or chicken--my inner vegetarian should have won out here.  The naan was especially good and more than I could finish...perhaps a first.

Service was friendly and efficient.  The wonder was particularly warm and friendly; it is no doubt why my friends dine here often.

I think this place really works on a date or with a small group (2-4 people).  There is enough going on in the Junction to justify a trip out for dinner."}
{"text":"Let's just get this out:  Curry restaurants are too expensive.  Two entrees, one with only four pieces of meat (the lamb curry) a lassi, papadums, garlic naan, and two rasmalais should not add up to 50 bucks.  It is the same curry that you would get at any greasy spoon Indian place in Brampton.  They happen to have (somewhat) pleasing decor, and decent service.  At any greasy spoon curry house, you can have the same heartburn and potty issues.  However, high park eateries have to stop charging working folks 50 bucks for the same old coconut a ghee buckets."}
{"text":"Feeling too lazy to cook on a Friday night, and still new to the West End, we decided to eat out. I knew that there would be some places along Dundas St West, so we took a drive to see what we could find.

I checked out YELP, and saw Curry Twist, but did not read the reviews. Parked the car, walked along and looked at several other restaurants, Greek, Pub Style, another Indian place (which looked empty) then stumbled across Curry Twist. The line up just inside the door, told us we need to join in. Being a lover of Indian Cuisine, my taste buds immediately set themselves for a bountiful serving of Buttered Chicken. 

However, one look at the menu, and listening to the specials from our server Anant, we decided to have the Samosa's to start. We ordered 2 (one each) they came baked pefectly, the crust was crunchy, yet buttery, and the veggie filling came all to obvious that these were one of a kind. 

We nixed the Special, which was announced as Ginger Chicken and ordered from the Menu instead. We had the Chicken Pasanda and the Lamb Achari, with of course Basmati rice, and garlic Naan. The lamb had a wonderful spice and yes, quite a kick. I love spice, but my sweat glands say differently. An extra pile of napkins were needed (maybe a towel) the flavors were bouncing off my tongue and mixed with the rice and naan, washed down with a wonderful Indian ale, Cobra. My smile gave me away that I was fully enjoying this meal. The Chicken Pasanda was NOT buttered chicken, thank goodness as it allowed me to experiment, and that I did. We both relished over this dish.

The atmosphere at Curry Twist was welcoming and anything but rushed. We were seated right in front of the kitchen, which at first I was not quite happy with, but after a few mouthfuls, one did not realize. My partner had the Mango Lassi, which was almost the consistency of a milk shake, but much tastier.

Our server, although very attentive, did not always appear back to the table after every bite to ask if everything was alright, which I was grateful for.

I can see now why the line, as you can also order take out, but stay in and enjoy the ambiance. Im glad I found Curry Twist, it will be that little gem in the corner when I really fancy a good Indian dish!"}
{"text":"Shockingly Bland

I was shocked at how tasteless everything was. We ordered the veg samosa special as a starter- too thick a dough with a filling that had no bold spice. Then Aloo Ghobi which although we liked that it wasn't greasy, was full of mushy waterlogged tasteless cauliflower. Butter chicken was super sweet- totally over the top and the dhal had great consistency, but again- just tasted the beans, no real spice in there. I don't get it- nearly a full house and the most boring indian food I have ever eaten. This white girl's home made indian food tastes way better."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! I got the Butter Paneer and it was sooo tasty, very sweet, exactly what I wanted. The garlic naan was great too! I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but it was worth it!!! The atmosphere is so friendly. 

The only bad thing I would say about this place is that their \"mango shake\" is actually just mango juice from a container and it's priced at $3.95 sooo I would say best to stick to the other drinks that they offer."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city. Incredible flavours - a contemporary take on classic Indian dishes. Fresh, quality ingredients, the service is always great. It's our go-to spot for a nice meal out. I can honestly say, if you know food, and love food, you will love Curry Twist."}
{"text":"We went for dinner after reading reviews for this restaurant which was highly recommended by yelpers. Sadly, the experience was really just meh! The restaurant was full. But there was a vacant table available and we got it right away. The servers are very attentive but the food took forever to come. Even after the lateness the Paneer veggie twist we ordered was too watery and wasn't flavourful at all. The garlic naan was made fresh but tasted more like the frozen naan warmed up. Unfortunately the experience wasn't good enough for us to go there back. Ambience, service, location, veggie options - good but would rank it OK on taste and quality of the food. I would not recommend this restaurant.There are many other good Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here tonight. They sat us down with a basket of pappadums,  at that point it was a 40 minutes before we even got asked for our order. Pretty sure part of the wait was because our waiter was on the phone or maybe that's normal. We started out with the stuffed bread sticks which were incredible. I ordered the butter chicken and Michelle had the homestyle chicken curry.  The food itself here is worth 5 stars to me. But the sides are extra that includes Naan and rice which they will up sell you on. Our bill came out to $44 and we only drank water. This place is five star worthy but the service could of been a lot better for this trip."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Prepared fresh. They always have creative specials as well.  The take-out is also good (except the naan gets soggy by the time you get it home), so eating there is much better! :)
The aromas just hook me everytime I walk by"}
{"text":"Very nice small place. Nicely decorated. Clean. Very cozy and relaxing.  The service was excellent, extremely polite and friendly.  The butter chicken was excellent. Naan and rice also very good. The Macchi Tikka salmon was one of the best, perfect amount of spices and very tender. The Baigan Bharta was very delicious.  And the Indian stuffed bread rolls were amazing.  The mango lassie was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"First time dining in at an indian cusine. Kindly greeted at the door and sat at a table for two. A wide variety of beers to keep a yelper like me satisfied. We ordered the curry chicken and veggie brown cheese dish extra spicy which was absolutely delicious. Great service great food! I would suggest anyone in the neighbourhood to drop in if they want a bite of culture."}
{"text":"Once again I'm on my quest to find decent Indian restaurants.  Curry Twist is located in the junction about ten minutes away from my office.  The junction, much like Leslieville, is seeing its share of gentrification and is sprouting up with some interesting spots.  I've been to Curry Twist a few times, the first when they were in their previous location and again after they moved over about a half dozen doors away.  I love the vibe and the colours in the restaurant, it screams saffron to me.  

I had a chance to chatter with the owner and we were talking about food philosophies and the restaurant is very much driven by the belief in Ayurveda.  Ayurveda is primarily based out of the idea of balance, like yoga, combining foods and spices for good health and balance of the body and the spirit.  I must confess until that conversation I hadn't really known much about Ayurveda but I kinda get the idea of and it makes good sense.  The food at CT features the dishes from the northern regions of India as well as embracing the Moghlai inspired types of food.  How regal does that sound?  

The menu isn't large and I like this a lot.  Fewer dishes means less complications and a smaller margin for hit and miss.  My beloved eggplant is on the menu only this time it is called Bharta and its smoked in a whole piece and then mashed up.  The Lamb Madras is tender with a coconut sauce that is like velvet on the meat.  Fish Magic is so appropriately named.  :)  I've had the Chili Shrimp (pass the yoghurt and cucumbers please, this is a five alarm blazer) and I struggle with the heat.  Butter Chicken is what it is, butter chicken.  It is a standard in most indian restaurants and here at CT they do it justice.  The chicken has always been moist, not stringy or dry.  

Curry Twist is very decently priced, particularly with the sides.  Most indian restos will charge $6-9 for a pulao but at CT its under $4 bucks.  Servings are generous so I've usually got a lunch to go for the next day.  There is aIso lots of options for the vegetarians on the menu.  I highly recommend a stop in the junction in this small, comfy spot and you can discover the meaning of Ayurveda.  It's all about the balance baby."}
{"text":"Really quite bad. I remember having curry twist several years ago and it was quite delicious - naan bread was the right combination of chewy and soft and moist and oily, curries were flavourful and fresh. But this time was markedly different. We got take-out and a couple of different curries and some naan and the curries were so insanely sweet they were inedible, we tossed them out. The naan bread resembled grocery-store-bagged pita bread. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to coming here because of all the great reviews but was very disappointed. Service was extremely slow, dishes lacked flavour, and everything came to the table cold. I appreciate that the restaurant was very packed and busy and I think they might've been missing some staff, so maybe they will be better next time."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Fantastic! Even this restaurant is a little bit small, cozy but their food make it up. Simple decoration, tasty food. I have tried many butter chicken at different place but this place is the best. You can taste the buttery flavour and little bit sweet in the chicken. The lamb twist masala is also a good choice for people who want to try spicy food. The waiting staff is super friendly. I will recommend this restaurant for all my friends!"}
{"text":"Tasty no doubt. Just got take out though, so obviously can't comment on the service. 

Food was fresh and not greasy. Ordered a paneer dish, the eggplant bharta, and a chicken dish with two naan. The daily chicken special was the best dish- however sadly I have no idea what it was if I wanted to order it again! 

Found it a bit expensive ($43) and not as flavourful as the Indian I'm used to on Gerrard. Dammit. Bring on the grease?"}
{"text":"Sides and Naan extra. 

My friend and I decided to try this place last Thursday, as it was at the end of her street and looked interesting. I'm not usually eager to try places with 'curry' in their name as I'm a WIMP when it comes to spice. However, I thought to myself \"they must have something not spicy\" and eagerly joined her.

you pass the open kitchen on your way to a small seating area at the back of the restaurant which appeared relatively full for a mid-week dinner. Their menu covers most areas of traditional Indian fare.

I tried their butter chicken which is usually the safest thing on the menu. My friend and I shared a bowl of rice and garlic naan (both extra). The butter chicken comes in a cute little bucket and did not have ANY spice, I think I could have actually handled the next degree of spice. 

Service is prompt and attentive. Price point is reasonable. Restaurant is clean and comfortable. if you are a curry fan, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but its a little on the pricey side. I normally order the chicken korma, its creamy and spicy but they have many more dishes that are nice as well. I would come back only cause its near by and the food is pretty good 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Very tasty Indian food, albeit a very small menu.  An appetizer of potato patties and chick peas was delicious, as was my partner's lamb curry.  My butter paneer was good a but a bit two sweet.   Naan was fresh and hot.  A side order of raita could have used a little more flavour.

Informal but pleasant decor and solicitous service."}
{"text":"Toronto has a competitive field in the Indian food business and this place stands out!  The main reason is the chef/owner, Anant. He cares. He makes all his own curries, and they are all different and full of flavour. The home style curry chicken and shrimp curry are culinary triumphs. The saag paneer and daals are great. All other dishes are good and distinct. They are what they say they are plus some extra authenticity and magic in the seasoning. The nan bread, pickle and other sides are right on par with anywhere else that's good. Atmosphere and staff are friendly and warm. It's a little informal, but nice and clean. The best quiet place for the buck to eat in the Junction!"}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant, the thing that matters to me the most is the how am I greeted. The restaurant offers fabulous customer service and a warm welcome by happy-go-smiling servers. The also introduce you to the everyday house special menu items and take care of how you would like your food to be prepared. Extra effort is put in to make sure that your experience at the restaurant is great and if anything can be done to make it better. Indians are famous for their hospitality world wide and this place is an excellent example of the great Indian dishes, starters and beverages. The food is just to drool over and sometimes they can also prepare some special out of menu items just for their customers."}
{"text":"Thank you for fulfilling my real Indian food craving. This place is like a hidden gem. They nailed it with their Naan first; very soft and tasty. Then I got the house special which is Balti Chicken. It was very well spiced. The portion seemed small first but I could hardly finish it later. Then, they blew my mind with their eggplant special. The team is very friendly. I asked to Head Chef about their secret! He said: they do everything from scratch and they picked the ingredients very carefully. Now I know where to go for next time I crave for Indian food!"}
{"text":"Having moved not to long ago from Parkdale to the Bloor West/Junction area, I've been on the lookout for good Indian fare in this area. I think I found it with Curry Twist. I went last week for dine in and my partner and I split a chicken korma, an eggplant curry with some rice and naan. That night there was a samosa feature, so we had two of those as an app. Everything was great, but the samosas were the best part. So rich, moist and flakey. The price was reasonable. Our bill came to around $40.

The only complaints I would have is that the servers were not overly friendly. They were kurt and tried to rush us to order. Also, they were going to seat us in the back, but at the last minute sat us in the small section at the front (there were tables in the back and no one was sitting up front at this time). A few minutes later another gay couple came in and they were sat right next to us. I found it a bit strange, if I didn't know any better there was some segregation going on. I think I'll do take out from now on."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten take-out from here and it's ALWAYS delish. Happy with the speed of speed of delivery and temperature of the food upon arrival."}
{"text":"is there good desi food in the junction/west end? \"Meh"}
{"text":"A surprisingly delicious Indian restaurant with a limited menu, but sparse in a good way.  It seems like more focus goes into every individual dish and piece of the whole.  The garlic nan, dal amritsari, and saag paneer were all spot on. Super friendly service, to boot!"}
{"text":"Love! We used to live in Little India, so we were pumped to find this so close now. Really nice staff, always super attentive, fresh food, and great twists (no pun intended there) on some Indian classics. 

I'd you're into super spicy, this might not be your jam. But the food is full of flavour, and there's a ton of variety in the dishes. 

The butter paneer is amaaaaazing for the veggies that miss out on butter chicken (they actually have a ton of great vegetarian dishes), and the naan is like anything you'd get at the best Gerrard stops. Takeout is quick and just as good as dining in, and the prices are absolutely reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"This strip of Dundas West has three excellent Indians restaurants but Curry Twist is my favourite place to take family and friends. The cozy yet refined atmosphere makes it the perfect place to fill a table pass around the gorgeous naan bread, sweetly fragrant jasmine rice and copper pot after copper pot of mouth-watering curry dishes."}
{"text":"Finally ordered from this place after passing by it over a 100 times. Me and my sister ordered the butter chicken with basmati rice and naan bread on the side.

BOOOY LET ME TELL YOU!

The butter chicken was off the hook especially the sauce! Oh my goodness, the sauce was divine! Pour a little bit over the rice and use some as a dipping sauce for your naan bread. (which was also very delicious and made fresh to order!) Me and my sister ate everything with quickness.

Definitely plan on ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Waited about 15-20 mins last night for a table at around 815pm. The service was friendly and although the portions appeared small, we were very full after the meal. If you like heat, get the chilli shrimp! It's the spiciest dish they have on the menu. Flavours were authentic and garlic naan was great."}
{"text":"This place is definitely solid, I can see why it's a neighbourhood favourite. A coworker suggested I try it and I'm very glad I did, though I would like to try more of the menu. 

My friend had the much lauded Butter Chicken, and while I only had a few bites I found it not to my liking. I think it was a bit too much fenugreek and not enough tomato perhaps, but something was a bit off. Not to say it was bad, just not what I was expecting. 

I had the lamb madras and it was stellar, however. Every bite was tender and juicy, with lots of rich sauce. The smell was mouthwatering. 

We also ordered the fish magic to split and found it absolutely fantastic. Lovely flavour combination and just the right amount of spice. Great balance and seasoning, clearly the chef puts a lot of love into their cooking.

Service was friendly and fast, and we will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Sooo good! After trying many disappointing Indian restaurants in Toronto, this is one of the best we've been to! The chicken curry and lamb curries were AMAZING! Full of spice and flavor and properly cooked! The naan also was excellent. 
For good Indian food, it's well worth the extra $2-$3 dollars that they charge per dish compared to other places.

 The service is friendly and professional, with a nice atmosphere. My only minor complaint is that they don't offer tandoori dishes, probably because the specific tandoori oven requires a difficult to get and expensive license! 

Try Curry Twist! If you love good Indian food, it's very satisfying."}
{"text":"Have ordered take out twice, butter chicken looks and tastes different more like what your grand ma will make in the kitchen with her authentic recipe. The spices in chicken biryani were over powering, tasted good the next day.
Garlic naan is huge, keep that in mind before ordering :) 
Take out service is quick and courteous."}
{"text":"Curry Twist was a mediocre experience. The best part of the meal was the free pappadums we received on being seated. We ordered a fair amount off the small menu and were horrified by our first dish, the Tawa Paneer -  it was without a doubt the saltiest dish I have ever been served at a restaurant. Next came the rice pulao, the lamb masala and the saag paneer. The lamb masala tasted of black pepper, lacked any depth of flavour and contained very little lamb. The saag paneer was bland. The na'an was the worst I have ever eaten, it was cold, hard and crunchy. 

This experience was insultingly bad. 

The restaurant was packed, and once again I am reminded that being busy is not a good indication of quality."}
{"text":"The waiter set down a plate of naan and immediately I was knocked back by the fragrant herby perfume of the naan. Naan, the simple humble plain flat bread, was elevated into a heady experience. I closed my eyes and breathed in deeply the aromatic waft of herbs and spice that promised an exotic epicurean adventure.

I ordered the lamb madras, which was beautifully cooked. The lamb was soft and tender. They used great pieces of meat that was without much fat and gristle. The spicy curry sauce was wonderful. I heartily dug into my meal. The only thing that disappointed me at Curry Twist was the rice, which I found too plain and bland, which was at odds with the delectable flavor and odor of the other dishes. 

The mango lasso was cool and sweet. A little too thick to be completely refreshing, as I felt that I really needed a water chaser in order to get the drink down. 

The prices are reasonable. The service is good. Our food came out quickly and tasted great. It's a good place to come for a casual dinner with family and friends."}
{"text":"After eating way too many rotis over the past month, it was time to branch out and get some Indian food NOT wrapped in a delightful roti blanket. After doing some investigating on Yelp, my boyfriend and I decided to try ordering takeout from Curry Twist. We tried the Baigan Bharta, Chana Masala, and Butter Chicken with an order of Garlic Naan. Although the food sounded delicious (caramelized onions!) on the menu, I have to say I was disappointed by the flavours. The smokiness of the eggplant was completely overwhelming, and the Chana Masala had no complexity. My boyfriend also noted that the Butter Chicken was too sweet for his taste. I wouldn't return here for Indian food when there are so many other great options in the city."}
{"text":"Curry Twist offers fresh home cooked Indian food with a twist. Flavors are more bold, sweeten to please the downtown crowd. I found the food better than the service, and more experience servers would make the dinner experience more refined. The cozy room was warm and inviting but the waiter spilled drinks across others seated across from our table, so I would say the tables or the waiter would need reconsider their spacing. 

The food is what I come to eat, and it was tasty, clean and fresh. My butter panner was good, and the naan was to order. I wish they had offer a more complete Indian meal as most customers like myself do not know how to order everything."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Madras mutton curry was heavenly. Rich flavour of spices with coconut milk gravy compliment each other. The Naan bread was soft and fluffy. The menu is simple. All in all , I am absolutely satisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for a special day Valentine's day.  We were not given any type of warning as to the type of wait ahead. We ended up waiting 2 hours after being seated to receive our food. This is the longest I have ever waited at a restaurant and ruined what was supposed to be a special day. To add insult to injury we never even received a sorry or even a complimentary samosa or drink. After 2 hours of waiting for the food the waiter asked if my bf wanted another drink and he asked if it was free and the waiter just walked away. As for the butter chicken it had hard seeds in it where someone could break a tooth. The lamb was chewy. The rice was cold and bland. Our water glasses remained empty and not refilled. Instead of listening to romantic music all i could hear was an extremely loud and annoying dishwasher for over an hour. This is probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced with not even an apology for a 2 hour wait for food when there are hardly many tables in the restaurant. I couldn't wait to leave and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Was really hoping this place would be good as there were some good reviews for it, but it just wasn't. Ordered garlic naan and butter chicken and rice. Garlic naan was ok, nothing great. Butter chicken was not good. The butter chicken from Longos is better than this. It had no flavour and was probably one of the worst butter chickens I've ever had. Also, the rice which cost 3 dollars extra was just plain white basmati. I should have saved my money and made it in my rice cooker at home it was so disappointing."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and it's consistently tasty with attentive service!

We've tried almost everything on the menu and haven't tried anything we didn't like.

Our favourite is the lamb masala!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the junction. Got there around 6, didn't have to wait. We got 3 different dishes to share, all were delicious: chicken and tomato, cauliflower, chickpeas (I don't remember the proper name from the menu!). Also got nang and rice. It took a bit the the food to come, and there were people waiting by the time we finish around 7:30."}
{"text":"Now as a card carrying Indian (that's right, we have meetings) I know good Indian food when I taste it. I've been to many Indian restaurants and I have a pretty open mind, I can understand rationales behind different flavouring different chefs will use. Overall this place is not too shabby. The decor ambience is relevant and on point, and the service we received was prompt and attentive. We ordered a few garlic naans which were standard fare and a range of the vegetarian dishes including the eggplant and lentil curries. The portions are generous, our group of 4 couldn't finish everything. The food was good, however I have to preface it with this: the flavouring and spicing is definitely modified for a Western palate. This makes sense given the location and typical clientele, but I am confident in saying the authentic taste isn't exactly there. If you generally like Indian food you will probably like this place, it's actually a great place for dinner with friends or family. If however you have a trained palate for Indian dishes you will taste the difference and you may be slightly disappointed if you are always looking for that authentic taste. But overall a fine experience. I would visit again."}
