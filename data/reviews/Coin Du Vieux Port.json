{"text":"Looked appealing. Large menu w reasonable prices. What crap! Absolutely no taste in anything we ate. The soup obviously came out of a can. The macaroni salad was just bland. The Poutin was pure school lunch 1950s style It's by the port. Avoid!"}
{"text":"For $12.45, you'd expect that they would actually make their own lasagna and that It would be fresh and not a cold microwaved generic frozen lasagna.   The service was slow and awkward. My sister received her plate 10 min after my mother had received her's. We were a total of three during dinner hours on Sunday.  Stay clear from this \"Coin\" and go somewhere that's worthy to be in Montreal."}
{"text":"Super expensive for crappy food! Seriously, don't go! Even for the drinks! Hopefully, you'll read this comment before ordering anything! This is for your own good!"}
