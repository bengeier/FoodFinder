{"text":"Decor and menu is pretty much a rip off of Popeyes Chicken. Lickin Chicken is a halal option but the quality of the food and customer service at this location is below par.

Also, they do not deliver past 2km."}
{"text":"I went here last night around 10pm. The menu and decor is exactly like Popeye's. I found the chicken burger to be delicious and the sauce they use to be more flavourful. The breading was light and crispy.

I throughly enjoyed it. I'll return to try other things on the menu. I would note that they need a good ventilation/fan system as there were fumes (colorless) from the kitchen. Otherwise prices were great."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken at a great place. Biscuits are amazing and best of all open late"}
{"text":"My sister reccomended this place to me. It was hard to find as they recently rebranded. It basically looks the same, sells the same food, has the concept, but prices went up.
She told me to get the chicken wings and Cajun fries. The fries were okay, not the best.
I asked the woman behind the counter what the most popular flavour was and she gave me spicy bbq. The spicy bbq was a nice spicy, a bit vinager /Tabasco tasting. The breading was thick, the wings were extremely moist and squeezed out with juice with every bite. The service was also super quick. For reference, when I got wings at pizza hut, they told us it would take 20+ mins to heat up.
I give this place 4 stars because it wasn't the best I ever had. It felt overhyped to me, but was certainly not bad. Better than a box of frozen wings!"}
{"text":"This place has some new owners and rebranded under Drumstickz. It still takes aim at the regional popeyes but service and delivery has gotten much better. 

Once again the place has been remodeled, they've fixed some of the pricing and quality issues and ended up as a viable place to go when I want something different. I'm happy to see them turn things around."}
