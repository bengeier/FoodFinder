{"text":"The name says it all - they sell deep dish, square pizzas.  The flier tells us that there is 30% more pizza, though my 8th grade geometry tells me that it's actually 27%.  I guess round numbers sell better.  The pizza itself is really good.  I think calling it deep dish is stretching it, similar to saying \"30% more pizza\".  The toppings are piled on, no question, but the fact that they can deliver it to you in 40 mins says it all.  Regardless, the pizza is high quality and a 10\" fed me for 3 1/2 meals.    BTW, since they don't have an online menu, here's some more info - they do sell round pizzas, which are 2-for-1 and start at 17.25 (for a 10\" pepperoni).  The square/deep dish pizzas start at 13.35 for a 10\" cheese (13.65 for a pepperoni)."}
{"text":"Fantastic deep dish. All we order now. A hidden gem in Bowness. Expect old school credit card machine that reminds me of my childhood. Adds to the experience"}
{"text":"One of those hidden gems in Bowness, the building looks bad and its take out only, but the pizza has to be one of the best I have had in Calgary not a doughy thick crust like some joints make, so lite and crunchy bubbly with very little grease, plenty of fresh toppings and bubbly cheese,   We ordered the north side special several times and it was always exceptional.   So this place looks like a little hole in the wall dive but appearances are deceiving."}
{"text":"Surprising hit ! Buried in bowness but amazing good deep dish pizza ! Really satisfies that craving !"}
{"text":"I have been ordering pizza from here for years sure the one thing I dislike is the fact the prices go up and all they do is right on the menu prices have gone up don't have the price changed or anything that does suck but all in all it is the best pizza I have had in the city I've tried a few of their varieties and by far it is the best pizza for deep dish that I have had in the city and I would definitely say if you're looking for some pizza get it from here"}
