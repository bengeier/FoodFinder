{"text":"With my school and work schedule I don't go off school grounds to eat just because I don't always have the money to eat there. Well I had finally made the walk with a few people I am working on a group project with; BEST FOOD EVER        All of my friends, well most of them, have been here and have only ever had good things to say about it. I was skeptical but I love food so I went to try it and it was by far on of the better decisions I made. I got more food for the money I paid. The luau pork rice bowl with teriyaki sauce was so good.        If you are looking for good food Come here you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"On the up-side, the ambiance was very neat, and the staff were friendly and helpful. On the down-side, dine-in water cups smelled a bit like dish rag, and the food wasn't impressive.  Coke on tap, with Pibb rather than Dr Pepper.  One of us ordered a chicken bowl, which was bland, and not even as good as a dish we used to order from Applebee's years ago; the other ordered a charred (but seemingly still precooked) kahuna burger, which was sloppy and slipping apart, the flavors and textures didn't blend as well as they could, and it left a small longing for the Hawaiian burger from Fat Boy.  It was all OK, but just OK, not even \"A-OK\" as Yelp says. I noticed that a Braddah's is going in soon on the other side of the parking lot; it'll be interesting to see how that battle goes."}
{"text":"On a friends recommendation we went to the Rumbi Island Grill for lunch today, fell in love with the place and the employees. The cashier greeted us with a smile. The staff brings the food to your table, asked if we needed anything and every time they deliver to another table they come by and ask if your ok or need anything. Great little place, very clean. We will be going back. We tried the Island Chicken burger, Jamaican Jerk Chicken salad & Surf Club sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this establishment! The food is top notch, I usually get the luau pork plate. Though everything else I've gotten has been superb. The employees are great and always genuine with us. Also, the restaurant itself is very clean. Compared to the surrounding area, it's much nicer. If your looking for island food on the west side of town, Rumbi should be at the top of the list."}
{"text":"First time here didn't know what to get. The dude working the counter was helpful. He even let me try a sample of their \"rumbi rice.\" (It's rice with some red beans cooked in coconut water) it was good. I ordered the pork bowl with brown rice. I checked in on yelp and I got some free tempura shrimp! The food came out fast. And I'm going to work on it now. It's a pretty good teriyaki bowl. Now I need to teach them a thing or two about \"tempura\"  too heavy of a batter. But it was free, so who am I to bitch. Now I'm stoned so who knows if my tastebuds are in a generous mood, but I'm full and happy so life is good."}
{"text":"First time here. Didn't know what to get the cashier \"Camille\" was her name was so friendly and recommended ahola tacos with steak. I LOVED IT. Great food ,service , and atmosphere! Great job Camille!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at the Val Vista and Baseline location probably 5 times over the past 12 months. The food is good and reasonbly priced. I usually get the Volcano Chicken Sandwich and my wife likes the Cabo Fish Tacos. Both are fantastic. The sweet potato fries are the best around and we love the dipping sauce. Most of the time the employees are very nice and the place seems to be clean. The food seems very fresh and we have never had a long wait. I would definitely recommend trying Rumbi's."}
{"text":"My third time here and I must say that it definitely was a charm. Alyssa greeted me and displayed exceptional customer service as usual.  Ceasar, the chef, showed consideration by personally asking me about my preference of my order. The food is always fresh and full of flavor.   Ordered the Volcano Blackened Mahi fish with brown rice. Also, ordered the Hawaiian Teriyaki shrimp with the Rumbi rice. Always a pleasure to eat at Rumbi Island Grill."}
{"text":"Never had Hawaiian food before, I was not disappointed. The food looked and tasted amazing. Best burger I've ever had so far!!  The cashiers were really helpful when I didn't know what to order; (Lionel is the greatest)  I am definitely eating here again ."}
{"text":"9/21/2015 Was looking for a place to grab some food at the last minute. My friend and I yelped restaurants and picked this spot. The food was very good. I got the fish tacos with Rumbi rice and bought the Rumbi fries(combo of sweet potato and crinkle cut fries) so we could share. My friend and her daughter got the chicken pasta which, they said they enjoyed as well!! Great food and even better service"}
{"text":"I've been going to Rumbi's for over a year but since I'm fairly new to Yelp I thought I'd give them a review. I work fairly close to them so I do frequent them often, I'd say more than 3 times a month.  I love Rumbi's, the only reason they didn't get 5 stars is they are forever messing up my order and putting onions when I ask for no onions, I've gotten to the point that I check my food before leave .They do fix the order and give me a discount but I really wish they could get it right when I ask for no onions the first time.  I love their food, the place is always clean. I must love them because I keep going back. = )"}
{"text":"I've only been here once  . .  so far, . . .but I'm going again soon!!        My daughter went on a trip out of state, so her boyfriend and I decided to go for dinner together. He's a real nice guy and always a great person to try new food with because he's adventurous like me! Rumbi came up thanks to a Cell Phone App  . .  Seemed reviewed well and close . .  and Hawaiian Food sounded far enough off the beaten path for both of us to get interested.       FIRST IMPRESSION : Rumbi is clean, and the Decor' is more upscale than the prices would tend to reflect.  Thanks to another friend who called and said . . \" I love that place, make sure you get the Rumbi fries!! They are amazing!! \" We tried them . . .  I will recommend GET THE RUMBI FRIES!! They are the best version of sweet potato french fries I have had so far.     THE FOOD :   I had a Rice Bowl with Pork and a sweet sauce, The entr√©e was 6.99 for a half bowl and 7.99 for the full bowl size . .  I figured for an extra dollar it would be nice to have leftovers . .  ***WARNING*** the Portion Sizes are HUGE! Taste was really something different than a standard asian rice bowl. The rice is coconut rice with lime, . .  Very Island-ish . .  Pacific Rim oriented. The pork was shredded finely and they didn't skimp on the meat. This made me happy . .  I found at the end of the meal I had 75% of the meal as leftovers, and I have been a lifetime member of the clean plate club. My mother-in-law tried some when I got home. My wife ate some that evening, and my daughter had some for breakfast. . .  Then I finished i the meal for lunch!! I'm talking that's so freekin' leftovers!       I will be returning for another visit soon!!"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience when I eat at Rumbi. Food is made fresh and fast and the employees are always super nice and helpful. And also patient when I spend a little too much time looking at the menu!   The dining room is always clean, but I will admit that I usually visit right after they open on the weekends. Since there are no trash cans you have leave your dirty dishes on the table, but since I've never been for dinner I can't vouch for how they keep up with the messes during busy periods."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service very friendly and the mango tea is awesome. I chose the cabo tacos and happy with the choice. The coconut rice rocked"}
{"text":"Got a chicken bowl today. It was mediocre, bland and boring. I ordered the spicy teriyaki  sauce but it was very cold and thick and I was not about to put it on hot food. If you want a decent teriyaki bowl, go some where else."}
{"text":"I went to Rumbi for lunch on Monday because it's close to where I work.  Panda is closer to my office but I find that their dishes are too sweet even the ones that are supposed to be spicy.  I ordered the combo chicken and steak bowl with spicy sauce and brown rice to go.  One thing that irks me about some restaurants is when there is a tip line on the debit/credit card receipt.  They are basically asking for a tip immediately after you order and haven't really received any type of customer service yet and the dish was over $9.  Anyway, when I returned to my office to try the dish, unfortunately I didn't like it.  The chicken was extremely dry, the steak was chewy and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce was o.k.  The steak was so chewy and fatty I almost broke my plastic fork twice trying to cut it.  I may come back because while I was waiting, another patron was served a burger and it looked and smelled really good but don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"For the kind of fast causal place that it is, it deserves 5 stars in that category. Fast and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place.  We hit it easily 2-3 times a week for lunch.  Occasionally, we will visit for dinner.  The dining room is always crowded during lunch, but, the service is extremely efficient.  The restrooms are impeccably clean!  The manager, Eric, and his staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Onto the food... We've tried several items on the menu, from the different burgers to several rice bowls to fish tacos to the salads.  Portions are large enough to share and they will even split it into two bowls/plates for you.  We have never been disappointed in flavor on any item.    Give Rumbi's a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place! The staff is super friendly, the restaurant is clean, & the food is really good. I always order the Kahuna burger & sweet potato fries with a side of tempura shrimp. The last time the burger was a bit dry compared to other visits but this was the first time that's happened (& hopefully the last). Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Rumbi Island Grill for many years now, and I used to go to the location in North Scottsdale.  However, I have moved back down to Gilbert, and was completely unaware that there was a location nearby in Mesa.  I was overjoyed when I found it, and went to eat there soon after.  My wife and I were very pleased that this Rumbi Island Grill was just as delicious as the other restaurant we used to go to frequently!  The staff is curteous and they checked on us throughout the meal to make sure everything was up to our expectations.  I was very pleased with the Volcano Blackened Mahi-Mahi with the side salad and Rumbi rice.  My wife had a Rumbi bowl with jamaican jerk chicken.  The portion sizes are very large, and we left very full.  We even had some leftovers to enjoy later!  This restaurant is an excellent value and will leave you craving it often.  I can't wait to go back there!  Maybe I will be eating there for dinner tonight...."}
{"text":"I have always like Hawaiian food and these guys have really good food! There prices are good.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very friendly and can be a good place for families and for dates."}
{"text":"Had the Kahuna burger. Delicious!  Will be back for more tastes from Hawaii.  Nice atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"Visited this place because of other reviews I read, looked cheap and food looked good.  When I arrived it was DEAD! Only ones their, might be the same for you, but don't let that put you off.  We ordered a full and a half bowl of food. The full was $7.95 and great value, a good sized portion. Had the fire cooked chicken, Hawaiian teriyaki sauce and brown rice. Got a FREE large soft drink just for checking in on yelp, free refills to.  The food tastes great and was clearly cooked fresh to order. Would have been a 5 star review except it felt a bit strange being the only one's there, no music or anything in the back ground.  They also offer free delivery and $10 off a $25 order if you use promo code ZESTY Order at - www.bitesquad.com  Hope this helps in your decision to eat here. Enjoy your meals."}
{"text":"Rumbi's is a great place to eat lunch. I can only attest to how great their rice bowls are because that's the only thing I ever get.  My wife has gotten the hamburger here though and she said it was pretty good.  Rumbi's is eating out fast without feeling like it later."}
{"text":"I heart Rumbi!!!! Every single thing I've eaten here was good. I highly recommend the Aloha Mango Salad (hold the onions, though, they taste kinda weird in it), or the Bali Island Rice Bowl with Pulled Pork. Anything you get is bound to be over the top delicious though. The mango iced tea is really good, too. Their food is absolutely addictive!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, great service, and a great location.  The food is super fresh and way less expensive than you would expect for food of this quality.  I should probably tell you how healthy the food is, but I'd rather point you to the desserts.  I don't usually get dessert at a fast casual restaurant, but they are so good, you need to try them.  I'm definitely going to head back again and again until I try them all."}
{"text":"Gross. The food is too sweet, maybe I'm just not a Hawaiian food but never spending $10 on here again."}
{"text":"Had a teriyaki rice bowl delivered to me by a friend and it was FABULOUS!!  I could eat it every day!! Sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I'd have to say I will be returning when I'm in Vegas again.  I got chicken, shrimp and noodle full bowl and it was great. The vegetables were fresh and crispy. The chicken had great flavor and was very tender. And the shrimp was cooked just right. The service here was excellent and very friendly."}
{"text":"Have only tried this place out once but it is pretty decent.  First thing I always look at when I got out to eat is the atmosphere. More times than not, cleanliness and decor can offer some idea what the food and service will be like. The inside felt very cozy and the Hawaiian music really set the tone. There was one younger lady at the register and she seemed to be cheerful.  I ordered the Kahuna Burger along with sweet potato fries. The taste of the food was pretty good. I was surprised it came with two patties opposed to your typical \"single patty\" burger you typically see at places like this. I always get the Bonzai burger from Red Robin, which is basically identical to this, so I had an idea of what I expected out of it. It was good. Patties were juicy and flavorful and the fries were really good. But the prices didn't seem justified in my head. A side of sweet potato fries will run you $3.50. After walking out spending close to $11, I felt like I could have been more satisfied getting that Bonzai burger for about the same price that comes with unlimited fries. The plates are even more pricey. An Alaskan salmon plate will run you $10.50-ish and the portion you receive is less than generous.  I give it three stars because although the food was good, the prices just don't justify the meal. I am willing to spend more money on food if it's worth it. Call me cheap but if I'm going to spend $3.50 on a side of fries, they better be off the charts or a bigger portion and these weren't quite there on either."}
{"text":"Food has no taste whatsoever,i can cook thw same tasteless food at my place,nothing special!"}
{"text":"I've seen good descriptions of the restaurant in the other reviews so I will just tell you about my food...   I ordered the pork sandwich with Asian slaw and it came with mixed sweet potato and regular potato fries. I really liked it! The pork was a little salty but I liked that the fries came with a thousand island dipping sauce. Overall I liked it and will go back to try other things...   I'm having a little problem paying $12.00 for an everyday lunch but I guess I need to get over that cause it seems that most all places cost around the same... $10-12"}
{"text":"Tried Rumbi Grill for the first time this weekend. Food selection is good and definitely looked great. Service to get the food took an extremely long time even though they were not busy at all but overall the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I set out to find Caribbean food....but we made the best of what we got. The food was good and the service was fast...but this is more fast foody than sit down since you do order at the counter and then they bring out the food.   This is sort of a Hawaiian themed place with rice/noodle bowls and a few sandwiches. The teriyaki saw was to die for and the sweet potato fries were great too. I highly recommend the burger with swiss, teriyake and grilled pineapple."}
{"text":"Food is healthy and filling I love this place it has always been my favorite. I recommend the bbq chicken salad. It has ranch, chicken, and barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"Food was awesome service was great. I had Hawaiian teriyaki chicken and steak with Rumbi rice. Wow. Couldn't finish it wish I could. Wife loved her Aloha Chicken Salad. Looking forward to our next trip back."}
{"text":"They're a little slow on making your meal, but this was honestly the best I've ever had at a Rumbi. I always order the Jamaican jerk tofu rice bowl, and usually the tofu is undercooked and just soggy - depending who you are or how you like your tofu - their tofu was very well cooked and I loved it. The employees are very kind and considerate."}
{"text":"Just ate at Rumbi, had the island chicken sandwich. It was great! I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, had the fire chicken teriyaki rice bowl, and was super tasty.  Problem was that my chicken was a little dry, and my friends chicken was super juicy.  The cashier was super rude, and made everything seem like a struggle. She couldn't even give me a box to go without scowling.   So I would recommend going if you don't mind rude cashiers that hate people that smile a lot."}
{"text":"My friend from work and I ate here on our lunch hour and I was impressed not only with the delicious food, but the impeccable service. One of the managers actually remembered my friend -by name- although she hadn't eaten there in several months! When my fiancee and I decided to throw a Luau style engagement party, I decided to call them about catering. I went in and spoke with Eric, who was super helpful and even let me try a couple of the sides. He really took the extra time to listen to our needs and understand our budget. Eric was sooo accommodating!! He delivered our dinner for 45 people personally and even offered to grab any last minute (non Rumbi) items that we may have needed on the way! Our party was a huge hit!! Everyone complimented the food. ERIC-THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH, YOU MADE OUR PARTY A HUGE SUCCESS!"}
{"text":"The food here is above all else CLEAN, FRESH, and HEALTHY.  The salads are big and full of fresh greens and lots of goodness, with unique tasty dressings to sample from.   The Rumbi Burger is easily the cleanest tasting burger I have had from any restaurant. I would feed it to my mother!  I'm not a big fan of their teriyaki chicken, but the pulled pork with teriyaki sauce is a 100% home run. I like to order the Lauo Pork Plate.  The rice bowl comes with a ton of tasty vegetables and pork and rice.  The brown rice with teriyaki is great.   The key lime pie tastes homemade and is 5 out of 5 stars, easily!  I don't get why this place isn't busier. It is a clean, tastefully decorated location with friendly staff. Methinks they need to do more marketing."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Great teriyaki. To die for fries and a great atmosphere. Add to that a friendly staff and chill atmosphere you have a great place to have a meal!"}
{"text":"Really like this place.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the food is wonderful, reasonable prices and the service is great.  Go on Monday or Tuesday night, and kids eat free.  My ONLY complaint is the parking lot (as was previously mentioned in a different review).  My suggestions are the Maui Terriyaki (sp?)  Platter, with a mango iced tea."}
{"text":"Rumbi Island Grill looks and feels an awful lot like a high end fast food restaurant, however the quality of the food and the price are well above what you might expect.  The half size rice bowls we got were delicious, as was the chips and tropical salsa."}
{"text":"Love the consistency. I've been eating at Rumbi ever since it first opened in Avondale 5 years ago. And I was never once disappointed with my food."}
{"text":"Delicious blackened fish tacos and I love the coconut rice very unique! It's always clean and very fast service, love the atmosphere! Sweet potato fries are good too"}
{"text":"Literally the worst meal I have ever had at a \"restaurant\". I saw they had a groupon deal and checked Yelp and decided to try it out. What a huge mistake. The Kahuna burger, my God, what an absolutely TERRIBLE burger. Pattys had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The swiss cheese was not even melted and there was a very large amount of mayo on the burger. Every time I took a bite the entire middle of the burger would slide out of the bun because it wasn't melted. Now on to my biggest complaint; the fries. Their menu says something along the lines of \"add Rumbi fries, chips, or a salad to any burger for $1.95\". So I order and say I want fries, expecting Rumbi fries. I get plain old fries, like at McDonalds. The amount of salt on these fries was unbelievable honestly. So when the cashier/server brought out the food I said are these Rumbi fries, I thought that's what I was getting. She said, and I quote, \"You gotta tell me whatchu want. You said you wanted regular fries.\" I just about lost it right there, but somehow decided to hold my tongue. First of all, for $1.95, the options are chips, Rumbi fries, or a salad. How in the world am I supposed to know that normal fries would be served when they aren't even an option? Had I been served the Rumbi fries I might not be so critical of the rest of the meal, but without them everything else was just so terrible. Yelp definitely led me astray and I seriously would not recommend this place to anyone. I am not even exaggerating, a Big Mac or Whopper have more flavor than the terrible Kahuna Burger. This place tries to pretend to be Hawaiian by using pineapples. but it is just a poor excuse for a restaurant. I would not eat here again even for free. I wouldn't eat here again if I was paid to."}
{"text":"A real surprise! Loved the teriyaki rice bowl! The theme is a tropical Hawaiian island. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this very clean restaurant and we plan to come back.  The food was very delicious,  fresh & well prepared.   We met the Asst. Manager,  Rashawn which we thought was the Owner because he is so knowable of the food, very professional and truly a hard worker!"}
{"text":"For being a fast casual restaurant, this place is pretty good. I ordered the volcano blackened mahi with coconut rice - tasty food, well prepared fish and large portions!  Also ordered the key lime pie which was only so-so. For a quick dinner, this place is a go."}
{"text":"Yum! I had the cabo fish tacos. They were sooooo delicious.  I also enjoyed the Rumbi rice."}
{"text":"Good food, love the Hawaiian decor! Really like the chicken rice bowls with the spicy teriyaki sauce.  The vegetables they have on them are really good too. Casual atmosphere...great place to go when you don't want fast food, but don't want to go to a big sit down restaurant.  My 16 year old son loves it!"}
{"text":"The vibe is great. I love the interior and feel of everything. The staff is friendly and professional. The food is awesome and a nice change of pace from your typical place around my area. The pulled pork rice bowl is my favorite. But the pineapple teriyaki burger is a close 2nd. Great food, great service, great vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. Brought my 4 year old in there and they over heard her birthday was coming up and they came up to me and said that if we came back on her birthday shed get a free dessert which is amazing staff work to me.  They get a customer to come back and a happy kid. Food is awesome live the make your own rice bowl."}
{"text":"I'm on board with this place.  An island themed fast casual place that has great chicken rice bowls.  I haven't tried anything else, but I always dig places that can do a good brown rice bowl with fresh veggies and good chicken with a good sauce.  Rumbi does it.  The burger looks mysterious to me, but there are so many places out there that do a good burger, I don't anticipate trying theirs."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken bowl with the spicy hawaiian teriyaki sauce.  The food is on the healthier side and if you like flavored, unsweetened tea, try their mango tea.  the atmosphere reminds me of being on the island with island music and island decor.  Be prepared to wait a short while for your food cuz they make it fresh to order."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Food is amazing and always great customer service! They treat their loyal customers good with great coupons! They get it! Thank you"}
{"text":"Awesome walk in place for a bite to eat.  You order up at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  The atmosphere is going for an island theme, and the waiters are very nice and helpful.  The food is really, they also have your average burger and fries, which is fine for me!  Had never tried fries with thousand island and now I love it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch destinations. Everything I've tried here is great, I'm surprised it's not busier than it is. We can usually get right in most any time. Their sweet potato fries are amazing and anything with their aioli sauce on it is to die for!  Voodoo Chicken Salad... you rock!"}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter was rather rude to the man in front of my husband and I and she wasn't very friendly to us either. The food was extremely salty and plain. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews but I felt that I had to on this one. First off I called on the phone and asked to place an order over the phone and the girl was short with me and asked if I could wait \"a few minutes\" on hold because they had a long line and a family of 5 ordering, I said no problem and waited on hold for 5 minutes before I hung up. So I decided I'd just head down there and try and call on the way there again. (I tend to order over the phone because I find it to be a lot faster). So I did and this nice gentlemen took my order and quoted me 15min before I could come get my food. I ordered at 6:05pm walked in exactly after 15min, was greeted with an unenthusiastic \"aloha\" when I walked in, I went up to the register where this younger man was taking orders who seemed very shy (no big deal) so I paid and then was told my order wasn't quite ready. So I said no big deal and backed off assuming my order was being bagged.. which was waaaaay far off! I waited on the side while listening to the employees in the back who I could hear nice and clearly.. I'll add that none of them were wearing gloves while handling the food and none of them had hairnets or aprons on. There was a young girl, red hair,  completely belittling her fellow coworkers, yelling at them giving them attitude telling them no one is helping her and telling them how useless and ridiculous they are all the while throwing tongs on the counter saying \"she's done!\" And proclaiming how angry she is that she's the only one working and that there's no manager on duty, etc ETC ETC. I took a video of her talking rudely to her two co workers that's how shocked I was! After waiting and waiting and waiting some more I finally asked the boy behind the counter nicely how my order was looking and he said he was sorry and that he'd check on it, so he went back ( I can see everything going on) and asked where the teriyaki bowl was and where the tacos where and the red headed girl raises her voice and says, Well the bowl of rice has been sitting there for forever, the tacos are there and here's the kids noodles! Then I watch her cut my steak on the cutting board which I guess wasn't done then watch her throw it back in the pan to cook some more. Mind you, it has now been 40min and they barely started putting my order together that I ordered OVER THE PHONE 35min before after I said something. So after all of that (believe me this is a long story short) I received my teriyaki bowl ( was supposed to be spicy and wasn't) btw I heard them saying to each other that they didn't know if they made it spicy or not) my husbands tacos and my sons teriyaki noodle bowl, finally walked out 50min after I ordered over the phone!! After seeing the way they handled the food with no gloves, none of them were wearing hair nets or anything I told my husband I wasn't sure if I wanted to even eat it. I decided to anyhow no idea why and the flavor was on point, my husband said his wasn't bad and my son liked his noodles BUT the food was EXTREMELY oily and my steak was a little chewy since the girl threw it back on the grill. All in all if I had to rate the food I'd give it about 3 stars but because I witnessed the terrible back of the house service and the way the red head was treating these poor guys she was working with and the time I had to wait for my food I only give it 1 star and that's only because it won't allow me to give none. Hopefully the manager of the establishment reads this and gets some more help in there and rethinks the red heads employment because she is a terrible team player, is negative and extremely rude! End rant. (Going to try and upload the video of the girl being rude also)"}
{"text":"YUMMY!   I absolutely loved this place !!   You pick what you want from the counter, and from there, the rest is full service.  The restaurant is clean and the food is FRESH!! The management and staff is super attentive !  Everything from the chicken rice and veggie bowl, to the blackened salmon entree, to the mango salad blew my mind. I've had the pleasure of dining here several times, and it never disappoints .. I will be back !!"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and both times it has been excellent.  So far I have tried the Jamaican Jerk and Bali Island chicken rice bowls, and both were very good and flavorful.  The portions are plentiful as well. The interior is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful relaxing feel to it.  The patio area is clean and inviting as well.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and they come around at least once or twice to see if you need anything (extra sauce, to go box, etc). My only regret is I wished I had tried them out sooner!"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after going to the Maryland locations many times and the food was terrible. I got a bbq chicken salad and carrots were bad. Also the chicken didn't taste right and pita bread was stale. My husband had a teriyaki bowl and his chicken and rice weren't good either. The rice was really gummy. We feel like crap after eating it.   Sadly, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is wonderful and the employees/owner make it a welcoming atmosphere! Had the bowl with all veggies and chicken. Chicken had great flavor and tender! Not dry at all! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers you can find around. Hands down.  I found this place out a year ago and go back when I can. Business seems to be picking up cause I now find it pretty busy during afternoons and evenings. This establishment totally deserves it too.  I recommend the Kahuna burger or Rumbi burger. Both are amazing, and come with the secret \"Rumbi\" sauce."}
{"text":"Good lunch but a little pricy for my taste.  The employees were extremely friendly and very helpful.   Checked on us twice to make sure everything was well.  I had the white rice teriyaki bowl with pork and tofu.   tofu was good, pork was very good and the vegetables were fresh and a good variety.  I'll be back to try something different."}
{"text":"Had a deal from Amazon Local for this location and decided to give it a try. We ordered the Beach burger and Big Kahuna burger. We had an order of regular fries and \"Rumbi\" fries (which are basically a 50/50 splits of regular and sweet potato). Top it off with two fountain drinks and a brownie. It was a meal of indulgence for fast food.  Food arrived looking fantastic. The Kahuna has a thick slice of fresh pineapple, perfectly caramelized and sweet. There was a thousand island style dip, but I opted for the classic ketchup. The meat was juicy with two nice patties, melting along the cheese and warming the already toasty bun.  I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries but the regular fries were good. Needed a bit more salt, but only because of personal preference.  Overall the food was delicious. I would definitely visit again. The decor was nice, the facility was very clean, and service was fantastic. Best of all, I can finally say that I've had a big Kahuna burger.  \"Mmm-mmmm. That is a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Big Kahuna Burger?\""}
{"text":"Really solid-great rice bowls, fresh ingredients and nice sized portions. I am a big fan of the chicken teriaki bowl and the macaroni salad (can't miss when you make it with cavatappi) and it's a very clean open kitchen. Staff are pleasant and it's a visually appealing venue to sit and eat in. And grapefruit Jarritos on ice-nice as well!"}
{"text":"Had a bacon burger that was super tasty (especially with the pineapple on top) and chips and mango salsa - also tasty.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was super helpful finding us gluten free dishes (my wife is gluten free).  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"6/5 stars! This place is so good! Sweet potato fries are to die for. Every time I come in the staff is friendly and helps with everything. They discontinued some tacos I get and she gave me a free entree for not having it! Great customer service and great food!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say this is one of the best places I ever ate! Great food! Great CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! If you ever come down by UNLV you have to check this place out! The food is fresh  and nothing is processed whatsoever.  Shout out to the chefs for working so hard and giving great quality food out.  Never once have I been dissapointed.  Favorite things on the menu. Volcano Blackened Mahi w/ White rice, BBQ Bacon Burger w/ Fries, and the traditional Full Chicken Teriyaki Rice Bowl.  CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!!! FREE NFL SUNDAY TICKET!!! so come on sunday and watch free football while eating fabulous food there.  overall.  I love this place and enjoy coming back all the time!  (Shout Out to Brett, Randi, Parshae, Jose, and Pitbull!!)"}
{"text":"Sad to give this place one star! Went into Rumbi with great expectations -seeing that it is rated four stars- but I came out disappointed.   As I was standing in line to order, the employees were practically yelling, complaining about their current work situation. (Something about being understaffed that day) They did not even try to be discreet about it, which I feel makes the business look bad. Even while eating, I could still hear them speaking loudly to each other in the restaurant.  I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl & mac salad. Big portion, but it was... Eh! I love going to Hawaiian restaurants, so I was bummed that it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. They also forgot to bring out my mac salad & there were only 2 other people inside the restaurant. On top of that, I'm not even sure it can be called \"mac salad.\" I took one bite & didn't want any more of it.   Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!!! The chicken was so dry i threw it away I expected so much but the entire experience was q let down  I would not even give a second try"}
{"text":"Went back in January and never finished this review lol.  Got a burger and salad. Delicious and fairly priced!"}
{"text":"Very convenient and fast! Great bubbly staff, and great food. I recommend the kahuna burger with sweet potato fries! :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering food to go from here and because of this visit I will not be coming here again.   I ordered two combos from Parshae and used the Yelp coupon for free shrimp tempura I received for checking in. I had a couple of questions about the sauces and she asked if I wanted to sample the Jamaican Jerk which I really appreciated because it gave me a better idea of the flavor. She asked me what my first combo was and I repeated that I wanted pork and sirloin. I then went on to tell her what my second combo was just in case she wasn't sure. She completely cut me off and with an attitude said, \"I already got that!\"   After waiting at a table for my order Parshae brought it over and explained to me which combos were in each container. I went on to ask her about the shrimp tempura I ordered with an attitude she said, \"you didn't order shrimp!\" I reminded her about the Yelp check in coupon I showed her earlier and her tone changed quickly. When she walked over to get my shrimp another worker came brought it over because she realized it was missing and was very apologetic.   It's sad that bad customer service has the ability to overshadow the food a restaurant serves, but it's just reality. With so many restaurants in this town, the newer ones really need to ensure they hire people that don't have a chip on their shoulder because it reflects in the way they talk to the customers."}
{"text":"Food was good enough for 4 stars. Service from one guy, an assistant manager I think, was great. The counter person, not so much.   Portions are big and fresh. You'll fill up for sure. One strange thing though. When the food arrived it kind of smelled like burnt popcorn. No, I'm not kidding. Was really weird. The smell didn't last long though."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try a new place to celebrate our 15 year anniversary so we stopped in. As we stood looking over the menu, we let a couple pass us and told them we were still deciding what to get since it was our first time. They said everything is really good - and they were right!!  My wife tried the special spicy lava noodle bowl that has chicken, mango, corn, red pepper with sriracha cram sauce. This dish is absolutely delicious. I ordered the luau pork plate with rumbi rice. It has a great Hawaiian teriyaki sauce, creamy island macaroni salad and Asian slaw. We also ordered a side of rumbi fries which is regular fries and sweet potato fries mixed 50-50. We have not found any place that does sweet potato fries very good because the potato is so dense it is difficult to get them crispy. We ended up ordering just sweet potato fries because they are so good. Personally I am not a fan of sweet potato fries and I couldn't stop eating them. This is the place to go for great Hawaiian food!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Try the luau pork plate it's delicious!"}
{"text":"The Jamaican jerk salad and sweet potatoe fries are awesome. There my favorites. Nice friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service, and really like the quiet, laid back atmosphere. The pulled pork sandwich is my favorite menu item. My family and I love eating here."}
{"text":"This place is terrible chicken bowl was cold and super hard chicken looks like it was cook 5 days ago never will I come back, a refund would be nice!!"}
{"text":"First time burger and fries mix, the sweet potato fries are tasty.  But nothing memorable that drove me to come back until months later, a co-worker wanted to try it...  Had the chicken and steak bowl with brown rice, on the side they kindly gave me both the teriyaki spicy and peanut sauce.  Teriyaki spicy won and chicken over thinly chopped steak (tasted a little off actually).  Servings are generous but nothing that will drive me to come back until someone asks me to join them again."}
{"text":"You can't beat their sweet potato fries, best of anywhere I've been. I'm sad to see they took the Caribbean chicken salad off their menu. That was all I ever ordered. :("}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Its amazing, We like the Grilled Chk and Shrimp meal, The grilled Mahi Mahi Fish Dinner, The Rumbi rice is quite tasty too. We love the sweet potato fries and the yummy dipping sauce. Fresh cooked to order, tasty and a clean restaurant with friendly staff. A must try!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for years.  The service wasn't great for a little bit, but they have stepped it up again and the service is good again. Food is good, although isn't super flavorful.  The sauces are mostly indistinguishable.  But I still like it! The sweet potato fries and sauce are super yummy."}
{"text":"The fish tacos with \"Rumbi Rice\" (coconut rice) is the best $8 I can think of spending.  Really, really, really good.  It's a fast food-ish type of place but THE BEST fast food I've ever had.  As long as you're not looking for a glamorous spot, this place wins."}
{"text":"My friends 'ranted and raved' about this place so I decided to go....  It was rather expensive and I was not all that impressed!  Although the sweet potato fries were amazing... the main dish I ordered did not have much flavor."}
{"text":"Has to be fake reviews or something, I got the \"teriyaki\" chicken bowl and it was canned chicken with a cup of mediocre sauce and very subpar noodles and two pieces of broccoli.. definitely not authentic Hawaiian"}
{"text":"We have been coming Rumbi for years.  It's what I call \"slow fast food\".  You go up to the counter and order your food.   They then give you a number to place on your table and they will bring it to you in 5-10 minutes.  The rice bowls have a ton of food and I always have enough for lunch the next day.  I've also had their chicken sandwich....delicious!   They also have sweet potato fries which is always a plus in my book!   Their tropical salsa is homemade and fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner.  Mondays and Tuesdays are kids eat free.   A meal will run you around $10 and is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Had no idea this place has been here for 10+ years, came across it on Yelp and gave it a try. The menu is authentic island food with lots of options. Fair prices under $10 for a meal as well. Huge shoutout to Lori for taking the time to show us around the menu and checking on us to make sure the food was good. Thanks Rumbi!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant. The music island themes and nice. Very clean... except for the pretty disgusting email sign up sheets at the register AND soda/water dispenser where you get your utensils.   The house salad was good with a bit of fruit, a lot of sliced almonds on top and okay vinaigrette. The salad came out with the entree so entree wasn't really hot after eating the salad pretty quickly.   Regardless of the temperature, the entree, Volcano Mahi, described as   \"YOUR CHOICE OF SALMON OR MAHI SEASONED WITH VOLCANO SPICES, TOPPED WITH MANGO-PASSION AIOLI & PINEAPPLE SALSA. SERVED YOUR CHOICE OF HOUSE OR CAESAR SALAD & YOUR CHOICE OF RICE. RUMBI RICE +.99\"  was almost completely tasteless. The coconut flavor in the $1 up charge rice was detectable in only a few bites, the beans didn't add much and the fish tasted like steamed fish. No volcano, or any other flavor was really noticeable. The dish was presented EXACTLY as it looks in the photo online though, even down to the very colorful sprinkling on top, though apparently that's not actually spice.   3 star meal if it was $10-12. For almost $20 with a drink it's a 1 star meal in a 3 star environment."}
{"text":"When I saw the Groupon was available for this spot, I had to take it. The reviews seemed a little bit up and down so I had to check this place out with my own eyes. The verdict? I'll use the overused Yelp term, \"pleasantly surprised\"!  I believe the concept here is Hawaiian/Caribbean fusion. Even though this is the first time I have ever heard of this, it does make a lot of sense to do so because they share a lot of tropical ingredients.  This store is located right across the street from the UNLV. The layout on in the inside is definitely a tropical theme. I was dead set on getting a combo plate and burger, the advertisements all over the place were singing the praises of their pineapple upside down cake. Having not one of these since I was a mere lad, pineapple upside down took the place of the burger. Also got a side of Rumbi fries instead.  Combo plate - decided on getting the 2 meat combo of pork and grilled chicken. The chicken was a little bit dry, but not that much. It had a nice chargrilled taste to it. I like the fact that their Kailua pork had a very subtle sweetness to it, and wasn't salty as f*ck like how a lot of places make it. I ordered brown rice and was glad they didn't use long grain brown rice, which is terrible even if it cooked correctly. They used a short grain one and it was pretty good. The stir fried veggies were good and didn't taste like they used frozen veggies. I liked the sesame oil taste to them. The only thing I didn't like was their teriyaki sauce that was thankfully put into a small container on the side. It might as well could have been maple syrup, it was that sweet.  Rumbi fries - here's a hint, ask them to put their blackened seasoning on them, it's really tasty. The Rumbi fries are a mix of regular shoe string fries, and thick sweet potato fries. Both were crispy, and the creole-like spice seasoned them very well. The dipping sauce tasted like a looser dynamite sauce and complemented the fries well.  Pineapple upside down cake - the last time I've had this was about 20 years ago and I made it from a Betty Crocker mix. Trust me, this was nothing like that. The cake had a complex pound cake like flavor, except being a whole lot lighter. The pineapple was nice but probably canned, and the whole thing wasn't too sweet, so I was pretty surprised.  The food came out fast and was well prepared. Hopefully when school is back in session these guys will start to pick up because I thought the food and service was pretty good here. One thing I didn't like is that they wouldn't let me use the yelp check in with the Groupon, but I guess you can't win them all. Unless it was a game of UNO in which I would kick everyone's arse!!"}
{"text":"Omg sooooo good I got the blackened salmon. Def coming this week to try the shrimp and chicken and the pineapple cake!"}
{"text":"We placed a large order because one of the nurses was leaving and this is what she wanted to eat. The quality of the food has declined and they charged a $15 delivery fee along with a  $15 service fee. I will never be ordering from there again. I will be saving myself  $30 by just going to Panda express and the food is much better."}
{"text":"We eat here a few times a month usually. We eat their Rumbi Burger often along with their Rumbi fries which are a mixture of regular french fries and sweet potato fries which are both perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They serve their fries with a special Rumbi sauce which seems to be something similar to a thousand island sauce... delicious!   We recently tried their fish tacos which were great as well, and their blackened salmon is a must!   Great food for a great price!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here when we lived in Phoenix.  On a recent trip back the family chose to eat it again.  Love the pork sandwich, the kids love the burgers and the chicken rice bowls.  The decor is fun and gives you an island feel.  The fries are excellent, including the sweet potatoe fries.  Wish we had one in Cali!"}
{"text":"If you are craving some island food in Chandler then this is the place to go. Get past the backyard Hawaiian themed decor and the \"Tropical Friday\" shirts the staff has to wear and the food is pretty good. I would not say it is the best Hawaiian food but it will do. The Luau Pork plate is one of my favorite then I would say the lunch bowls are a close second (with the Rumbi Rice). I would recommend passing on the steak selection as it is not all that great.   As I have stated before, fresh brewed iced tea is always a good thing. Two kinds, regular and mango."}
{"text":"May I recommend the Kahuna Burger? I'm a huge fan of Pulp Fiction and I always wanted to try a kahuna burger so I was pretty excited to find a place that makes them. I don't think they are modeled after the film but the burger is delicious. I also recommend the rumbi fries!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular during the lunch hour, food is always prepared quickly with quality and the customer service is great. My only comment with be the portion of meat you receive in salads or rice bowls, other than that it's definitely a great spot for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"The food is great!  What makes it better is if you become a fan through there website they will send you coupons once in a while to use BOGO!"}
{"text":"So great! Delicious Rumbi Pork Salad and Tacos. Don't forget to order the pineapple upside down cake  The crew of two served our group of 20+ like a boss in record time.  Awesome food, excellent service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos are good, but being a rice,tortilla, and soup lover- Id say go to L&L  Sweet Potatoe fries are yummy. Noodles try Yummy kitchen on Eastern and Silverado."}
{"text":"Placed an order for pick up at 6:47 PM, arrived to pick up my order at 7:02 PM & guess what?!? It's CLOSED! I guess the new hours are 11AM- 7PM Mon- Fri. Well thanks for telling me when I called in my order!! Jerk!"}
{"text":"The best island grill I've ever tried. Steak and chicken terraki plate was amazing. Fresh, appealing,  and extremely tasty."}
{"text":"Came in tonight. Was up front with no workers for about 5 mins before the cook looked up and said she would get someone to help me. They were training a girl, which I totally understand. However the order was incorrect and when you spend 20.00 on a bowl it would be nice to get what you paid for. I got no rumbi rice which I asked for half of i wasn't charged I don't believe but the receipt says full size rice bowl no details. They gave me one sauce for a large bowl, i am game for new people to be given opportunities but customer order accuracy should be a priority by the seasoned staff. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food here the hula salad is great as well as the aloha mango salad . You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Solid menu, great customer service! Right across from UNLV. Definitely worth stoping by. The coconut rice is to die for!"}
{"text":"Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out.  First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.  The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut \"Rumbi rice\".  We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.  For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.  All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and I'll be returning to try and test each one :)"}
{"text":"We love Rumbi and drove here from the far west valley since we miss Rumbi since the one in Avondale closed. The spicy teriyaki bowl is the best. I wish it were closer."}
{"text":"So sorry to see one of our favorites is closed. Drove 12 miles to eat here only to find it is now a pizza place. :("}
{"text":"Ordered the Bahama Mama's Tortilla soup and side house salad today. The tortilla soup totally looked and tasted like fish not chicken. The meat was flaky and had the taste and consistency of fish. When I told the young girl at the register she said \"it's chicken\" with an attitude. I ordered a rice bowl to replace this as I don't like fish taste or smell and she never offered to refund my money for the fishy tortilla soup. When she brought the new order to my table I showed her the meat in question in the tortilla soup and she still insisted that's what their chicken looks like. Again no offer to refund the money for the untouched soup, only an offer to clear it out of my way.  I have never been served a chicken tortilla soup that looks, smells, and tastes like fish and I will not be going back here again. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Since I'm at school for a long time, it's good that restaurants and food locations are only 5-15 minute walks from UNLV campus. In the beginning of the year I received a coupon book and wanted to use it because it was a buy one get one 50% off an entree (SCORE, college students are low on $$).  Service When I walked in, the area was kind of small. Our cashier took a while to come out, but was nice. Not much interactions with employees tbh.  FOOD I ordered the Volcano Blackened Fish Mahi Mahi because it looked good on the reviews. The display was good and simple. I didn't really know what to expect, but it was good. Not the best quality of course, yet the meal was delicious.  CONCLUSION I will return to try different menu items, and also CHECK IN because you get a free soft drink."}
{"text":"I like this place more and more everytime I go. They send lots of email coupons for buy one get one free meals which makes it even tastier! I am updating because I had the sweet potatoe fries! They were amazing and I love the dipping sauce they bring for them. I always feel like I get my money worth here because the portions are so huge that I get two meals out of the bowls. I get to enjoy the meal again the next day for lunch! I tried the fish recently as well. It was good. I was trying to eat healthier so I gave it a go. The seasoning was really good and they let me get the coconut flavored rice and beans with it which is always very tasty."}
{"text":"Really good salads.  Like other posters, a $12 lunch seems a bit high to me, but it is par for the area - but it a semi-selfserve restaurant, just a tick too high.  Never left here disappointed with the food and the service staff are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing fantastic. The staff was really nice and helpful though."}
{"text":"Really irritated last night, went here with 10 friends, and they were out of white rice. Isn't that kind of like a burger joint being out of hamburger buns? Anyway I asked if I could sub noodles or their other rice, and the girl behind the counter told me i would have to pay extra... I told her that i would prefer white rice then... she would not sub anything for it. So apparently if they are out of something, they make you pay extra. I'll be going elsewhere with my friends. That is some really poor business practice."}
{"text":"Yay Hawaiian food! Yay for Hawaiian food close to UNLV campus! There were no food trucks on campus and I wanted to try something new, so I hoofed it across campus to try out Rumbi Island Grill. The decor is pretty Hawaiian inspired which is great because it reminded me of home. I looked over the menu and after awhile decided to try the Luau Pork Sandwich.  Except when I went to the counter to order, I saw their limited edition Island Combo on a board above me and decided to get that instead! It had two pieces of shrimp tempura, my choice of brown rice, my choice of steak instead of chicken, and my choice of house salad with some sauces. When I checked in at Rumbi, Yelp popped up a \"1 Free order of cookies\" which I decided to cash in on and got a little bag of M&M cookies.  I took my table number to a corner table and realized there was free wifi with password (just ask them for the password when they bring your food). When they arrived with my food, I dug in. It was good and though it took me awhile to finish, because I was also doing homework, I finished everything and was happily stuffed. The employees kept coming to my table, as well as others, asking how was my meal which I liked. There are also clean bathrooms in the back of the restaurant.  I definitely want to come back and try out other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since '07.  Great food.  It's a little off than when we first started going there.  Not bad, just different."}
{"text":"Remember that scene in Elf when he pours syrup on spaghetti?  Rumbi serves the same thing-- except with teriyaki sauce. Everything is bland served with teriyaki sauce and a pineapple... because THAT makes everything taste better.  The chicken looked like it was pre-cooked and the grill marks were drawn on. The salad was nothing special. The decor, makes me want a Mai Tai, which I wished they served. Instead, they had a large assortment of Mexican bottled sodas.   One star because , it was still edible. But-- shit is edible but you shouldn't do it. With better food choices nearby, why Rumbi?"}
{"text":"Food here is really really good! Chips and salsa are amazing! Glad I found this place! Will be back for sure. Hopefully they open another place like this in Henderson ;)"}
{"text":"I have this app on my phone that lists the places near you where kids eat free on specific days. It's usually full of sub-par diners, but when I saw Rumbi's listed, I had to jump on yelp to see what people had to say. Mixed reviews, so I took a quick peek at the menu, it sounded good, so we decided to check it out.  The restaurant was fairly clean and a few other families were eating when we got there. We perused the menu longer than we usually do but we didn't feel in the way or rushed in any way. They have everything from rice and noodle bowls to burgers to sandwiches to seafood. It was hard to decide.  I ordered the fish tacos and polished off the whole plate in no time. The order came with two tacos (type of fish not specified) and rice with beans. I seriously ate it so fast that I can't tell you what all was in it. Pretty sure the salsa was tomato, onion, pineapple, and cilantro. There may have been cabbage, and a jalapeno ranch type sauce. Don't quote me on it though. The rice and beans were really good and scented but I couldn't pinpoint the flavor. Very good though.  Husband had the Kahuna burger (two patties, pineapple, swiss, typical burger toppings) with the Rumbi fries (regular and sweet potato). The burger fell apart as most doubles do. He really enjoyed it though. Kids had the chicken dippers and the orange-honey chicken bowl. I was surprised that both kids polished their food off since dinnertime can be somewhat of a battle.  As we were finishing up it started to get busy so we got there at a good time (right before 6pm). I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kahuna Burger and fries. Visually it looked tasty. I soon discovered differently. The quality of hamburger they use is terrible. There a lot of grizzle and fat throughout which made it chewy.  The fries are mixed with regular and sweet potato fries. The first few I ate were ok but did not last. I will not eat there again. Jack-In-The-Box is better and their food is subpar."}
{"text":"We decided to go here because I found a two for one coupon.  I had the chicken teriyaki with brown rice and it was very good.  The veggies were delicious and tasted very fresh.  I ordered the full size bowl and there was definitely enough food for two people.  While we were eating, there was a worker there that kept sweeping the floor right by our table, which was incredibly annoying.  It would have been a better atmosphere if she had waited until we were done eating to sweep under the tables.  But o'well, it was still a good lunch."}
{"text":"Why does your description  on bitesquad say Hawaiian  food? We ( the people of Hawaii) do not put teriyaki sauce on Kalua pork. Please fix your description  because your menu obviously has nothing to do with Hawaii."}
{"text":"Love it! Just wish I got bigger servings if the macaroni. The employees are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great inexpensive food. I like the pulled pork sandwich and the Blackened Mahi the best! Love it here!"}
{"text":"Would give no stars if possible.  This was the worst meal I've had in a long time.  I used to eat here all the time a few years ago and loved it. Ahi poke bowl across the street was packed, so I recommended to my friends that we come here.  I got the Maui burger.  The bun was enormous and the pineapple and burger patties were like half the size.  The burger was completely cold on arrival, the fries were cold.  My wife's rice bowl was cold.  My friends agreed it was not that good.  I was only able to choke my meal down because I was so hungry.  Also, the kids booster seat was extremely sticky.  The kids mac and cheese was worse than kraft.    This is not the Rumbi I remember and I definitely won't be back.   Went at 7:30pm on a friday night."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere and easy to find! When I got there I was greater by a very friendly guy. I ordered to go and was offered water while I waited. Food was still hot when I got home and it was delicious. I got the large rice bowl with chicken and teriyaki sauce! Probably some of the best food I've had. A huge quantity of food which is great quality that isn't gonna break the bank!"}
{"text":"Was my go to place when I lived in Vegas. Good islander food, not the best but cheap. Salmon was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was great; service was fantastic. My first time eating here. I got the teriyaki chicken half bowl with white rice. Hubby got teriyaki chicken with rumbi rice. I liked the portion generosity with the \"half bowl\".  The veggie mix included is zucchini, celery and carrot mixture and it is lightly saut√©ed. I enjoyed the way it was cut and  cooked as it still had crunch to it and the veggies were sliced thin so they'd cook without being soggy. The chicken was white meat, tender and good. The sauce was excellent. It was sweet without being too sweet. My husband didn't care for the rumbi rice which was rice with a \"kick\" and had red beans mixed in.  The staff was helpful. I appreciate service with a smile. In California, I feel like we see less and less of that, so I really appreciate it and notice it more now.  The two guys working made us laugh and just went above and beyond to make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. The atmosphere is amazing. Love the music. Always makes me remember being in Hawaii.  My favorite dish is the kahuna burger and you can never go wrong having the Rumbies fries. Love the sweet potato fries and the chips and tropical salsa as well.  The staff are very friendly and it's never noisy. Just a nice place to relax and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday and must say it's amazing. I cannot wait to come back. The staff is attentive and amazing. I had the rice bowl with white rice, noodles, and jerk chicken. It was so yummy. I am already craving another rice bowl!"}
{"text":"We love Rumbis!  Especially the Chicken Mango Salad, the sweet potato fries, and their rice bowls.  Everyone is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"I describe Rumbi as Hawaiian Fusion. It's a chain out of Utah ... They have awesome salads ( I loved the Mango Salad) their sandwiches, fries.. And their rice bowls. You get a lot of food for your $- and being across from UNLV that's important for poor college kids. But most importantly food is great, staff is friendly and food is fast. Try something different"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My boyfriend and and I have made our mission to try every menu item. The rum rice,is surprisingly sweet and amazing. The blackened Mahi is to die for and the bowls are delicious and huge!!!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment. Menu changed since my last visit. They no longer have the chix sandwich with grilled pineapple and teriyaki. Ordered a rice bowl. Didnt like the chix in it. Tasted like the already cooked chix u buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. They are still generous with the veggies which is a plus. Decided to be daring and try a different sauce-the peanut one. It didnt hav much flavor. Wish i had picked a different sauce."}
{"text":"Oops! Thought this was a sit-in restaurant, wrong. It's more of a fast food place, but that didn't really bother me.   We both had the kaluha burger (2 patties, pineapple slices, teriyaki sauce) with a side of 'Rumbi fries' (sweet potato and regular fries mix) on the side. Talk about messy!! It's tangy, sweet, sloppy mess was pretty juicy in my mouth, but the more it continued, the more I felt sticky and in real need of a shower. Really. I felt kinda gross afterward...but I can see their attempt to punch it with more flavor.   I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in Rumbi corporate are a bunch of guys that got hired from Rubio's (white-washed mexican food) coming up with these ideas. Yes, it says 'Island' in their sign, but it's not authentic island food in any form. There are teriyaki bowl meals on the menu board as well? Definitely white-washed island food at it's best. So far I haven't seen anything really 'grilled' either. 2 burger meals cost us $20."}
{"text":"So I got a salad from here just now, and I ordered shrimp on the Caribbean Salad. Got my salad to-go and paid and extra $1.50 for the shrimp, get home to eat my salad and there are 7 tiny little pieces of dried out, over cooked shrimp. Why did I pay extra for that?!? Sucks too, because before this incident I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Came to Rumbi twice and food is always bomb, but this review will be reflecting my latest visit.  So I came to Rumbi to eat with a couple girlfriends and I was one of the first people to order out of the 10 of us. Yet, as time went on, I noticed that everyone that ordered after me was receiving their food before me. Finally the worker and all of us realized my food was forgotten. At first it gave me a sour feeling because of the wait o had to go through, but let me tell you, their service recovery was great. I was upset that my food was forgotten, but Cliff, a worker there came up to me and made sure I was getting my food. He was very genuine and kind and I was suddenly happy again. I understand that esp when there is a rush and not many people in the kitchen, there is room for mistakes. The way Cliff handled it was just great. He made sure that I was going to leave the restaurant happy, and I was. He gave me a comp card for my next visit, and was so very kind. I enjoyed my meal with my friends and recommend this place to everyone! Great service, great food"}
{"text":"First time we went here I wasn't planning on coming back, but all changed when one day... GROUPON gave me a credit for the stuff I didn't received so we decided to use it here.  So I'll list the food we got to go: -Kahuna burger combo with volcano style Rumbi fries: LOVE IT!  -Full rice bowl of Pacific honey orange glazed chicken: PANDA EXPRESS' ORANGE CHICKEN IS BETTER, (I hate having WAY too much rice with no more meat) -Carribean chicken and shrimp (my hubby got this) he said: \"It was good!\" -Tempura shrimp It's aight! Batter was too heavy, my daughter ate 5 so she must have liked it. -Bahama Mama Tortilla soup: okay it comes to the soup, the reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because the soup tasted more like coconut milk. We knew that it said a hint of coconut, but did not expect it to be like a tom yum (Thai soup) coconut soup. I mean it was WAY too coconutty. -Chips & salsa: tasted like chips and salsa ;) -Maui mango cheesecake: they gave me a regular New York cheesecake it's cool though a long as I got my DESSERT! -Brownie: baby girl got this, tasted it, AWESOME! Okay this place is so lucky that I even bother doing a review. So guys and gals give this place a try. Groupon offers a really good deal $8 for $16."}
{"text":"I don't know how I never noticed this place and I'm disappointed it took me this long to do so! I went in on a Sunday after the lunch rush. I was originally planning on sitting outside to enjoy the new cooler Valley temperatures but as soon as I walked in, I knew I had to sit inside to enjoy all of the island decor. I perused the menu looking for a Hawaiian Plate lunch I had been craving and was happy to see more than just Hawaiian offerings. I was set on what I wanted though and ordered the Luau Pork Plate. My only problem was that I didn't know what Rice would be best so I asked the very kind cashier what his recommendation was. He asked if I've ever had the Rumbi Rice, which has beans and a slight coconut flavor, and offered me a sample. I graciously accepted and after tasting (I'm normally not a big fan of coconut) went with the yummy Rumbi Rice. My only disappointment is that they don't have any POG juice but, then again, it's extremely rare here on the mainland. I sat down and admired all of the decor... very nice! There were a couple unbussed tables but they seemed to be understaffed at the moment. Not a deal breaker because the cashier was very friendly and keeping busy taking orders. He brought the food to me and I was almost embarrassed how quickly it was gone! The Pork was delicious and I loved that they don't use the traditional elbow noodles for the Mac and Cheese. The bed of Rumbi Rice was a nice twist as well. Now I can't wait to bring my kiddos back on Monday or Tuesday so one of them can eat free!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I had Blackened salmon with Rumbi rice and house salad. All the ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. Fun atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I got the kahuna burger and Rumbi fries, the hubs got a pork and chicken rice bowl. The burger was awesome and loved the sweet potato fries! His pulled pork was amazing, I will be getting that next time. Great gluten free options and fresh tasting ingredients!"}
{"text":"I was hopeful, but not impressed.   I had the simple chicken bowl. I figured - chicken, rice, some seasoning... who could mess that up?   Yeah. We're not coming back, unfortunately. There wasn't anything majorly wrong with the service (pay for your meal and then you're done) or the atmosphere - I'm just not a fan of their food."}
{"text":"I ordered 5 items through door dash. I was so excited to get the food and was so disappointed. Everything was so 'off'. Except the sweet potato fries. They were great. It was almost like the chicken was odd as well as the sauce. (We use to get this catered once a month to work and everyone fought for it. Except the last 2 times.) It was like something has changed. Plus I ordered the Pacific Honey-Orange Chicken Rice Bowl  for my kid and got a different plate completely. This was my first time to use door dash and I when I received the wrong order, I just called Rumbi's directly. I did not complain about the food. I only told them that I did not get my Pacific Honey-Orange Chicken Rice Bowl which is a tempura coated chicken. I got something totally different. They put the manager on who was rude and insisted that he had talked to me directly and that he put in what I ordered. 'I never talked to anyone. Door dash is an online service.' He replied, 'then deal with door dash'.  I get that I probably called the wrong person. I only called to tell them about the wrong order that I received. But he totally handled it unprofessionally."}
{"text":"My wife Dharma did a review the first time we ever ate in the restaurant.  It was kind of a lark, in that we were both very hungry and decided on a whim to come in.  We thought the name and the d√©cor were interesting.  I am not here to beat a dead horse, I just wanted it to be known where we were coming from on this review.  It will be right above my wife's review.  So, after the experience last time, the manager was kind enough to contact us.  He contacted us quickly.  We ended up with a refund and 2 free dinner meals, neither of which we asked for or expected.  He was genuinely concerned and you could tell he cared.  I appreciate that.  Nothing in this review should negate that at all, but I also want to be honest and to give a fair review because as a Manager myself, I find that yelp! and other services like it definitely help you find the kernels of truth that help you improve and invigorate your business, customer service, and your interface with the people who visit your establishment.  So, that all said, here we go with visit 2:  The food was good.  The food was hot.  The young lady that brought it to us was nice and gave us extra napkins without asking.  However, at the register my son asked for his \"Beach Burger\" to be without tomato and onion. a He repeated it several times.  The burger had tomato and onion on it.  No problem, you can just pull them off and this allowed me to have extra tomato on mine.  Easy to forgive.  At the register, we presented our free meal coupons from the first visit and from the Manager and for some reason, they had to do them separate.  That means we got the same thing basically, but I had to get two swipes of my debit card, 2 receipts, 2 number cards for the table and so on.  It seems very inefficient.  Much like the last time, all the trouble really happens at the register.  We had to repeat our orders several times.  We wanted to make sure and there were still hiccups.  Another thing to consider is sustainability - 2 transactions for a father and son who sit at the same table, come in at the same time and are together seems like a waste - of time, paper, energy and patience.  I think it must have to do with how they input into the register, but I believe business pays a small fee for debit/credit transactions and so they paid it twice.  Still, really?  No big deal, I'm not upset or anything, but with just 2 visits to go on, this seems the sore spot in the operation.  Once you order and get your food, the food is good - heck, great for the price - and many of the staff members are very nice and are trying.  No complaints on this visit there.  To Brett, I believe his name is, who was so nice to us and made us give the place a second chance, I say thank you.  My wife declined the offer due to the rice bowl, but the burgers are good and I understand what restaurant management is like, I have done it myself.  I don't think it would take much to get this establishment out of the A-OK status of 3 stars for me.  If there was a variable I would go for 3.5.  I just think a few little things and considerations would help greatly.  Another thing now that I think about it - our first visit it was packed and crazy.  Today, just my son and I, another couple, and a few just off work employees hanging about.  Just seems something is going on that is keeping this place from being top notch and I'm not sure it is the management, although they are who can control and change things.  The place is clean.  The bathroom is clean - always a good sign.  Half the staff are friendly and seem happy and concerned about the place.  Some seem surly and act like they need another place to work.  One was obviously off work wearing a tank top and shorts and looking like he might have just worked out, kept staring at us and went behind the counter for something to add to his collection of items that were covering the little bar area over by the drink machine.  No big deal, but his actions are being mentioned because at any restaurant, you need everyone behind the counter to look professional and dressed similar to show who is working there and who can help you and there was a mish mash behind the counter and behind the grill.  Several have Rumbi shirts and look great - others in street clothes.  Just my opinion and my observation for what it is worth.  I really feel, especially judging from the other reviews, that the reason this restaurant seems to score mostly either 5s or 1s, with very few in between - check it out for yourself - is because of little things like this - some things bother some customers that might not bother others - but you have a real \"love it\" or \"hate it\" thing going on with this restaurant and that tells me it is definitely fixable and that any input, review, or observation should be helpful.  Thanks for your time.  My son says he enjoyed the burger and the fries and he thought it was good.  Due to this, I would go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"While at the Aloha Festival, I met the General Manager Sean. I tried a taste of their chicken there, I really enjoyed it. He enticed me to visit the restaurant by giving me a couple of $2 off coupons. Who can pass that up?! So on 6-11-15 I stopped by to try out another entr√©e. Inside the restaurant has a great decor with a fun feel and light colors. Plenty of natural light entering to give a bright eating environment. I tried the pork bowl this time. I was great. Plenty of meat and rice and great vegetables. The price range is low so you can get lunch for under $10. Great lunch spot. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading the reviews online. Such amazing food. Picked up 3 rice bowls for the family & no one was disappointed.  The staff was friendly & very helpful letting me know whats good.  After checking in on Yelp I got a free order of cookies.  The food was more than enough for the family & the price was really reasonable.  All in all great food, decent price & i will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood restaurant.  Amazing flavors, nice, and clean restaurant.  The staff are extremely nice!"}
{"text":"If you've lived in California and had true Hawaiian food like The Loft - island fried chicken mixed plates with mac salad and cabbage salad or King's Hawaiian's mixed plates, do not come to Rumbi's with those expectations.   However, if you want a good quality chicken breast teriyaki bowl with some quality fresh veggies, this is your place. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was pretty good. The side order of mac salad and coleslaw and Rumbi burger with mixed fries were not up my standards. Their mac salad was bland - too many large chunks of pasta, the coleslaw was bland and did not have enough dressing as well. Burger was ok.   I think one thing Rumbi does really well: their mixed french fries + sweet potato fries - great fries. I'd come for the fries. But everything else was ok in my book."}
{"text":"I'm extremely thankful for all the awesome restaurants near UNLV. Rumbi is on my top 3 places to eat. Today was \"Free Rice Bowl\" day, so the restaurant was crowded with very little room to maneuver. I'm certain that its not busy like this everyday, but the line was pushed through fairly quickly. I ordered the Volcano Chicken Sandwich and I was blown away at how fresh this sandwich was. I would give this place 5 stars, but I don't have enough information yet to do that. I'll revisit this review after a couple more visits.   Staff is extremely friendly, they get the food out to you pronto, and the price is very reasonable. I might give the Cabo Fish Taco a go next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"Perfect Florida restaurant! The Mahi-Mahi was delicious and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Love, love, love thier fish tacos!  I can't get enough of these little beauties, I crave them.  Everything we had was delicious - my daughter had the chicken fingers and fries which were also very yummy.   I am trying the sweet potato fries next time they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Eh... This doesn't taste like any sort Hawaiian food I've had. The quality of the rice bowls are similar to what Jack n' the Box sells. Not great whatsoever."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great teriyaki and only ranking 4 as my husbands burger wasn't up to par temp wise"}
{"text":"Excellent. Very fresh and more on the healthy side. Definitely recommend. This is the second time here this week. Glad I found it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rumbi Island Grill, fresh food,  extremely welcoming staff and a very nice ambience. Kids eat for free after 4 p.m .... Unlv students eat for half the price with coupons. Their Bowls are big and tasty ....... All in all good bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! I'm not a fan of sweets but your guys deserts kill it!!!! Thank you! Bring on the Henderson location!"}
{"text":"Although menu prices have significantly risen in the past few years, Rumbi Grill, to me, is a one-of-a-kind delight.  I usually get their bowls which contain your choice of rice, island-vegetables, and meat (or soy!)! The vegetables and meat are always super fresh and everything tastes very authentic and fine dining-worthy.  The sandwiches and salads, though a little pricy for a non sit-down restaurant, are large portioned and very tasty and fresh.  Also, Rumbi's sweet patato fries are delicious and a unique treat!  The atmosphere and cleanliness of this establishment are top-notch and very inviting! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I love this place the burgers are or was the best in town which surprised us because it's a island grill. But Lately the buns have been hard dry and not good at all.  Maybe they got a deal on buns but what a mistake. I will try it one more time after a couple of months and see if they smarten up and go back to the original delicious buns they had before."}
{"text":"First time here and loved the atmosphere.  Went there around lunch time and was glad it isn't crowded like other restaurants in the area.  The meal was prepped and delivered to us in a timely manner.  The only bad thing about this place is the lack of portion honesty.  My coworker and I did a lunch run for the office.  Some ordered full bowls and some ordered half.  We were told the full bowls come with more rice AND meat.  Unfortunately when we opened our to-go bowls up, we were disappointed at the fact that we paid more than the half sized bowls for more rice and the same amount of meat.  What's the point?"}
{"text":"Food was meh. Good atmosphere, friendly employees, but the only thing I tasted on my chicken sandwich was the pineapple, and my husband's Kahuna burger had the exact same flavor profile. So, meh."}
{"text":"Omg! Best place to get lunch or dinner. Kahuna burger was great. Great clean place. I recommend it for anyone. They always have specials...just sign up."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Very friendly staff. It was our first time and they were very helpful. I had luau pork. It came with macaroni salad and cole slaw. The pork was shredded and tender. Served on rice with teriyaki sauce. The macaroni salad was also really good. Wasn't a fan of the cole slaw but I don't usually like it so it's not their fault. Also had a pineapple upside cake for dessert. Very happy I did. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Menu is huge, food is good, service is good as well.  Portions are large.  Only complaint I had is that the food tends to be a bit salty.  Other than that, quite good.  Parking lot can get crowded."}
{"text":"At 7:30pm on Saturday night,  called to place an order. The guy answered the phone and said even tho the website says they close at 9pm they were closed. He just answers the phone incase someone wants to place a catering order or if the owner calls in. Good job closing way early on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here very once in awhile. Its clean, staff is friendly and the food is really good. I recommend the shrimp!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome when it first opened. The manager was on point and the service was as good as the food. NOW! It sucks. So disappointing. Management matters."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The first experience was blah. The second the same and for that you get a friendly two stars.   Forget why this place has a Hawaiian Island theme when the menu really just serves rice bowls and burgers. So let's talk about the rice bowls, of which I had on both occasions.   After waiting entirely too long for my food, it came out luke warm both times and having ordered the chicken with a different flavor option, the chicken is really nothing more than pre-cooked cubes which you are invited to drown in a store-bought sauce. I wouldn't have minded waiting longer if I was convinced that any part of my meal was prepared fresh and not so blatantly pre-made.   I've had worse, but not necessarily rushing back."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos pretty good have yet to try the other things but stay tuned!!! Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Has a nice little vibe to it not too expensive would definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and every single time we've gotten the luau pork plate.  That is fantastic.  I don't know what they do to that pork but it has a delicious flavor and is so tender.  Mixing it all up with the brown rice and mac salad is a perfect lunch.    On my last visit I tried the volcano-blackened mahi with vegetables instead of rice.  That was a great meal as well.  The fish was so nice and light.  The meal came with a fresh dinner salad too and I thought it was one of the better deals on the menu for the amount of quality food I got.  We've also tried the shrimp and chicken bowl with light honey orange sauce and brown rice, the kahuna burger with rumbi fries, and the tempura shrimp app.  The shrimp and chicken bowl was  tasty and a healthier option.  The kahuna burger was the only big disappointment.  That burger had no flavor whatsoever other than a hint of pineapple.  The fries, however, were delicious and I like the dipping sauce that comes with them.  The tempura shrimp app was good, but such a tiny portion for the cost I would not get it again.  If I'm craving cheap tempura I'll go to a Yogis Grill.    The staff has always been friendly and patient when we've had questions about the menu, and the atmosphere is very pleasant with Margaritaville-type music playing.  We always look forward to a visit to Rumbi."}
{"text":"This place was great. Friendly atmosphere. Clean. Most importantly, the food filled me up. Will be back with my receipt to get 50% off on my next order. See for yourself...tasty too."}
{"text":"I was searching yelp and I found this place. Good prices, and great taste. I'm not normally a fan of teriyaki sauce, but it just went right with my kahuna burger. The patty wasn't the best quality but im not complaining. The pineapple upside down cake wasn't bad for a fast food place. The cashier was very friendly. Keep in mind this place is close to unlv so there will be college kids in and out."}
{"text":"The rumbi (coconut hint) rice is super good. The bowls come with a yummy veggie blend and it's not too expensive! I got the teriyaki pork bowl with the rumbi rice."}
{"text":"I had the Aloha salad with chicken and it was good. My husband had the tempura shrimp which I tried and it was good. They were really nice and friendly, I'd go again."}
{"text":"Had a very good salad there today - Voodo Chicken Salad.  Less than 700 calories, and filled me up.  I asked for the house balsamic, it's pretty amazing.  Might have to eat there for lunch again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and I must say the food is delicious. Everything is fresh and it tastes delicious. The staff is amazing and they have great customer service. I didn't know what to order since it was my first and they decided to explain to me the menu. Everything was amazing. I ordered a rice bowl with Noodles and from the chicken to the vegetables in it was great. If you haven't checked this place then you should. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After shopping up a storm at Designer Studio Boutique & Tailoring and inducting Denise into our family - she recommended the Rumbi Island Grill. Considering it was just at the other side of the parking lot we were easy game. My sisters, Mom, and I walked into the place to check out the menu and were pleasantly surprised - there was a lot of healthy and delicious looking options to choose from.   I went for the Voodoo chicken salad and was so impressed and thought it was absolutely delicious! The chicken was moist and flavorful, the sauce was tasty and not overdone. It was a filling yet light meal.   The place was very clean and comfortable and the perfect break between shopping trips!"}
{"text":"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!"}
{"text":"Food is completely bland and way overpriced. Payed over $10 for a chicken & shrimp Jamaican jerk bowl that looked identical to my friends chicken teriyaki bowl. Other friend ordered a salad w/ no protein and payed $8.64. Only reason I even gave them a second star was because the service was good. Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Decent food the staff is always friendly not sure if I really consider it traditional island or even Hawaiian food but the prices about right for what you got and my kids like it"}
{"text":"Rumbi Island Grill offers a unique alternative to many eateries in the North Scottsdale area.  The have a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches, salads and rice bowls.    But what keeps me coming back is the chips and mango salsa!  It is very sweet and not what you expect at all.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. A little over priced but still worth it. I had the steak bowl which they charge an extra dollar for steak which is a little weird but it was worth it. Perfect amount of food for a lunch meal and didn't leave me too full so I could go back to work after and still be productive. Staff came around several times during meal to check in on me."}
{"text":"Not to bad but the food was underseasoned and the fries were overseasoned (very salty)  The place is small but has a nice feel to it.  It lost another star because I saw a cook without gloves."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the first review- How did I not know about this place?  How had I never been here before?  I have been there 4 times in the two weeks since I first discovered it.  Each time I have ordered the same meal...  one of the bowls.  They have two sizes- half bowl and full bowl.  I think the half bowl is plenty big enough for one person.  Once I ordered the full and I think it is the same amount of stuff on top and just more rice on the bottom, it wasn't worth the extra buck to me.  Once you pick which size bowl you want you pick your protein.  They have chicken, pork, tofu, veggie and others, I think.  I always order the tofu.  Whichever topping you pick it also has the other half of the bowl covered in veggies.  A combination of zuchinni, celery and broccoli.  Under the protein and veggies is your choice of rice- white, brown or rice and red beans or for 79c extra you could have noodles.  I always get brown rice and it is awsome tasting as well as healthy.  Then you pick your sauce which comes in a little cup on the side.  Choices are teriyaki- regular or spicy, jerk and something else.  I always get spicy, yummm...  A couple times I ordered the Rumbi fries and enjoyed them and the sauce they came with.  I highly recommend this counter service restaurant."}
{"text":"My teenage daughter really likes this place.  I haven't found anything I really like on the menu other than the iced tea.  I find the bowl to be average either with noodles or rice.  I don't care for the veggies on top.  The burgers are huge but not that good.  Lots of flavor but it is almost to much flavor.  The sweet potato fries and dip are good but so calorie riden."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I work next door and eat here at least 2 to 3 times a week. The staff here are all extremely friendly. You can tell that they genuinely like working there and like working with customers. The food is always great. I get the rice bowls or a salad and I ALWAYS get the sweet potato fries! They are to die for."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I had the pulled pork sandwich with Rumbi fries and the beau had the tacos with Rumbi rice. Pork was tender and tasty. Pineapple Upside Down cake was the perfect tiny treat to the meal.  Recommended for quick eats!"}
{"text":"My new favorite the voodoo salad - the dressing is what makes the salad and the feta cheese enhances it.  The customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Quick lunch stop after errand running. Rumbi was on the radar.  Order at the counter and then food delivered to your table by the friendly staff.   Ordered Garden burger that was being promoted on the door. Patty was typical GB you find anywhere.  The bun was very good similar to Hawaiian sweet bread, sturdy, flavorful and fresh.  Toppings were standard lettuce, tomato and mayo it was lacking something though. I would have preferred sliced pickles.  I recommend the Rumbi fries which is golden fries and sweet potato crinkle cuts combo in one dish. Very good fries.  Also ordered fish tacos. Two tacos with seasoned white fish (not sure type) with sweet cabbage slaw Pico and jalape√±o ranch sauce. When these came out my dish was not so hot temp wise but flavor was ok. Accompanied with a pineapple rice and speckled with beans and three tortilla chips.  I was expecting more flavor with the pineapple but overall bland rice. Dish was ok.  Mac n cheese was just easy mac but it was a filling portion for any kid.  The prices were reasonable for a lunch spot. Many deals and discounts available including free large drink with Yelp checkin.  UNLV students get deals and also a 1\2 off any entree if you come back up to 5 days first purchase after 4 pm. Interesting bounce back offer.   That is all! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with the food here; I got a full size rice bowl, and it made for two very large meals, all for about $9. Can't beat that with a stick.  On top of that, it was super tasty. Although, don't go there expecting any spice. At all. Even their \"spicy teriyaki\" sauce didn't have so much as a hint of spice.  This will definitely be added to my list of lunch spots in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service. Kids eat free (one per adult) on Monday and Tuesday after 4:00.  Please bring a location to Surprise! We were regulars at the Avondale location."}
{"text":"GREAT PORK TACOS!  Came here with the family after movie night. Place was clean, staff was friendly, and the food was good."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!  I had the fish tacos with rice.  The rice had a coconut flavor that was very different, but good.  And, the fish tacos were the best I've ever eaten.  I hope they build some of these restaurants in Texas!  I LOVED it!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times before, and had their tacos and rice bowls. Something about their half vs. full portion pricing doesn't make sense, so I usually go for the full portion even though I inevitably end up getting a to-go box for the leftovers. The service is prompt, the food is decent, and ambience is pleasant. There are limited options on the menu, which is a good thing for someone like me who gets easily confused if there are too many options to choose from. Their luau pork is probably the item I've liked the most, and would recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Mhmmmm so good. I had the half sized rice bowl with pork and Caribbean jerk sauce. It was very filling and it was so tasty. The pork was tender and not fatty at all. The rice and veggies were well cooked too!   Can't wait to try another dish!"}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain but after traveling in Maui for a week and then coming back home to Kahlua Pork from Rumbi, I can honestly say that the Kahlua pork here is better than any of the places I ate it at in Hawaii. Crazy huh? The Kahlua pork at Rumbi is so moist and tender and when its paired with some of their magnificent teriyaki sauce and Rumbi rice (rice cooked with coconut milk and beans), it is out of this world. The Kahlua pork plate at Rumbi has lately been the first meal that comes to mind when I want comfort food. This is a bit of a problem cause that is normally on a work day during lunch and after eating a meal of pork, rice, mac salad, and coleslaw, I am just down right exhausted and in dire need of a nap.  I used to come here quite frequently but forgot about this place and I am not sure why. Besides the Kahlua pork and Rumbi rice, I can say that their mac salad, sweet potato fries, and their beach burger are really good as well. If you are looking for something different, yet tasty and satisfying, try Rumbi. I think you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Rumbi! I am a huge fan of rice bowls to begin with and this place has an awesome way of putting one together. I highly recommend the \"Rumbi Rice\" over the rest of the choices for your bowl. The thing about this place is you design your bowl the way you want it and that Island flavor is great! If you are in this vicinity try this place!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great island food! Very flavorful and fresh. The menu isn't vast, but it is oh-so-good!  Makes me want to go back to the islands!"}
{"text":"Place is nice but they dont serve true \"Hawaiian\" cusine. They dont have poke or lau lau, but its fine. Food is good with a tropical punch. this place derserves a visit."}
{"text":"I called in my order for pickup. When I arrived to pick up my food I noticed they got my order wrong. I ordered two rice bowls. I told them it was wrong and they apologized. They remade my order and gave me a free drink while I waited. The food was made quickly and I was on my way. The food was very delicious and I thought their customer service was good too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their Rumbi fries. I had the Kahuna burger and thought it was juicy and flavorful. The staff is very friendly and eager to hear what you think of the food."}
{"text":"Ok been coming here for years, very clean, comfortable, and a relaxing place to eat.   You order before you sit down and they bring your meal out to your table. Rumbi's is an Island Themed Restaurant ... as is their menu.  The quality is a a giant step above fast food and the service is fast.  I mainly dine here at lunch but they are also open for dinner. No tips required which saves you money.  You have to check this place out for yourself to \"get the feel\".   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Cheap cuts of meat on the steak and chicken, if my boyfriend get's food poisoning tomorrow I'll let you know..steak has a taste of death. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm lovingggggg the island feel of this place and the concept of a quick service Hawaiin restuarant (QSR), however, I was not impressed on the food, prices, and wait time.  Yes, there was a lot of different varieties to choose, from rice bowls, salads, soups, and rice dishes, but it kinda lacked flavor.  It wasn't too busy and we waited about 15 minutes for our meals.  The prices are on the steep side for QSR's."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a beautiful interior design that makes you really comfortable just sit and enjoy all the lovely Hawaiian theme and feels like you're in a beach. I love the design so much. Their mango lemonade was phenomenal! Makes me want to refill my drinks all the time. Must try item: Half and half fries, half French fries and half sweet potato fries. I tried the steak and chicken teriyaki bowl and asked for the large size but they gave me a large bowl full with rice with small portion of the meat. Looks like I've been paying $1 more for the rice! (sigh). That's the only thing that I wish they can improve of and got no complaint eating while looking at the gorgeous Hawaiian theme pic they had!"}
{"text":"Service is very friendly and helpful.  Told them it was my first time there, and the lady behind the counter came around to the front and walked me through their menu and told me the top picks.   I went with a rice bowl with jerk chicken (YUMMO!) except I wasn't a fan of the \"Rumbi rice\" she recommended because it was a tad on the sweet side (fyi, has coconut milk in it - not a fan).  Got the full order and it was HUGE.  It's like 3 portions, maybe 4 if you're skinny and don't eat that much.  :)  Great lunch stop, especially if you're meeting somone and can share a bowl.  Looking forward to trying their other items."}
{"text":"This quick spot is good for fish tacos, salads or even a chicken sandwich.  The fish tacos didn't quite fill me up last time so I'm trying a salad with grilled chicken this time. We'll see!   The place is quiet enough for you and a friend to hear each other talk and for that reason I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.   I got all pumped up for some deliciousness and was really...really disappointed. The noodles I ordered were swimming in a watery sauce. The sauce tasted good, but it didn't stick to anything so it just tasted like... boring noodles and rubbery chicken. My boyfriend got a burger, he said it was boring. The sweet potato fries were unsalted, so they kinda tasted like sweet dirt. @ $22 for two meals, this was not cheap.   The kid at the register and the manager who greeted us at our table were super sweet, friendly and helpful. But I'm not going back because the food sucked. :("}
{"text":"I used to go to the Scottsdale location all the time until they closed it, sadly. Rumbi has good tasting food. I love the chicken jerk salad!! This is certainly comparable to a fast-food type burger joint in respect to quality. Great for lunch outings during the week."}
{"text":"OMG I freakin' love this place!  How have I not been here before??!?!?!  I want to eat here everyday.  I had the spicy teriyaki chicken with brown rice, and I thought it was AMAZING  My bf had the pulled pork and I tried it and thought it was better than most of the pulled pork we had in Hawaii (though they don't carry poi... boo)  So yeah.  I dug this place.  I'm excited to try the other items on the menu, although since the teriyaki was soooo good it'll be hard not to get it!  AGHH! I LOVE!"}
{"text":"If you want Hawaiian, go to L&L, Ono's, or Aloha Kitchen. True island flavors are more complex than this and not all based on coconut, corn syrup, or sacchariny-teriyaki.  I'd been eyeing Rumbi for a while and was psyched to try it out. I ordered the chicken rice bowl with the recommended \"Rumbi rice\" and I really couldn't finish it. I felt bad too, because someone paid for me, but it was really unremarkable and I didn't want to take it home.  The chicken was rather dry, the veggies were not fresh or crispy al-dente, and it was topped with a sauce that was way too sweet. The \"Rumbi rice\" was a low-grade quality rice with some beans and drenched in very sweet coconut milk/sauce. And it was expensive. My dining partner had the same thing with brown rice and we both had drinks. Grand total was just under $25, which was a bit steep for a poor stir-fry and fountain drink x2.  The service was friendly, however. So plus one star."}
{"text":"First time dining at Rumbi's this week, tried a chicken rice bowl with brown rice and the spicy Hawaiian teriyaki glaze, which wasn't spicy.  The chicken, veggies and glaze were good, but there was WAY too much rice, which I couldn't finish.  Would rather have more veggies and less rice. Overall, it was just average, but good enough to try again."}
{"text":"My 1st Island food experience was good for Phoenix and I enjoyed the Salmon plate with Rumbi rice and pineapple Angel cake. Prices are moderate and food was nicely cooked and filled me up. I ordered Mahi fillet and salmon fillet but got 2 salmon fillets but they were great. I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I love this little find, thanks to a friend of mine! While it might not be anything super special compared to another chicken and rice bowl, I do like that they have the option of brown rice and all their veggies aren't just onions.  Overall, a tasty meal with only 500 calories for the small bowl. Sounds good to me! :D"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty place. I would eat there again. I didn't have high hopes, but the upside down pineapple cake was amazing. Too bad I just moved further away from this place. The people that work there make great recommendations."}
{"text":"Great food, customer service, and timely fashion! Cliff and Alex were very knowledgable of the menu, ingredients, and prices. I enjoyed that they came by to check on the food and experience! Great to see a manager so active within the restaurant! We are always a returning customer when it comes to Rumbi! Till next time"}
{"text":"Just got in from FL. Here for three weeks, definitely coming back. Pork luau plate was heavenly, Mac salad was perfect. Rumbi island grill is #winning for your stomach and soul"}
{"text":"Hawaii theme, but with Caribbean dishes.  But that's OK.  None of it was authentic.  Still, it was tasty.  The menu includes jerk, burgers, \"luau pork\", and similar.  I had a burger (marinated in teriiyaki), my wife had the luau pork and rice.  Both were good.  The pasta salad thing was VERY mayonnaise-y.  Imagine scooping some mayo with a spoon and eating it straight, and that's what it was like.  Yuck.  The fries were very good.  You have the option of regular, sweet potato, and a blend of the the two.  Staff was friendly and seemed efficient.  Overall, a fine casual place.  Nothing spectacular, but it was good."}
{"text":"Rumbi gets two stars because all the staff I encountered were pleasant except for the manager who was hiding in the back.  Rumbi is \"known\" for its bowls so I ordered one. I had the chicken bowl which comes with vegetables and your choice of white or brown rice. I asked for the orange sauce and spicy teriyaki sauce on the side. The orange sauce was pre made and so was the teriyaki sauce. On to the chicken, rice, and vegetables. Vegetables were super standard for a teriyaki bowl, and the chicken and brown rice were adequate. I prefer the artificial orange sauce at Panda Express, even though I go about once every five years."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Had a big hair in my food. Kinda grossed me out so I only ate half. What I tasted was good."}
{"text":"Since I am low carbing it I got the fish tacos and a side salad. I did not eat the tortilla. The side salad was huge had I known I could have just ordered the side salad.  Casual atmosphere as I was heading out and had a nice relaxing lunch. Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing overall.  Rice was undercooked, food was in some cases too sweet, in others too bland.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their Kalua Pork Sandwich is honestly better than any that I ever ate during my two month vacation in Hawaii.    Hawaii is known for their kalua pork.  I ate it all over the state during my time there.  On pizza, on sliders, on plates, on sandwiches . . . none of it as good as what Rumbi Grill serves.    I love the bbq sauce that accompanies it too.    A great sandwich!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars if I only had the kahuna burger. However I had the Kailua burger as well. They are both extremely delicious but I gave it 4 stars due to the Kailua burger's bun becoming really soggy the longer it laid out .   However the kahuna burger was AWESOME , I recommend this burger because it was juicy, and had the right amount of sweetness. (Due to the pineapple) it's right across the street from unlv and its convenient and cheap! However I don't think the rhumbi fries were worth it. It's a mixture of normal fries and sweet potato fries . I only got about 5 sweet potato fries. For an additional 1.45 I think it was ?  Other than that , the service was great and food tasted awesome. :)  Go to rumbi island grill if you ever want a delicious kick to Hawaiian food !"}
{"text":"Average food, great service. To go order: Ordered jerk seasoned chicken it came out plain. And instead of jerk sauce was given teriyaki. Overall ok if you want something quick. Sadly with so many options in this area it would be nice if they stepped up the good flavors."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super friendly and the food is delicious.  I also love the fact that they have a baby changing station in the bathroom. You can't believe how many restaurants I have to eliminate because they don't have something that so small they can fit on the wall. Kudos to the owners. Thank goodness both of their Phoenix locations are in the east valley."}
{"text":"This was the first time visiting and I was impressed. We had the cabo tacos, club, and two kids meals. The fish tacos were really good and came with coconut rice that I didn't care for but was a hit with everyone else. The kid burger was really good and well proportioned. The only reason that u didn't give a 5 star is because the fries are extra with some of the sandwiches. The food and service is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"YUM! Rumbi rice is to die for! Cabo fish tacos and their rice bowls with the pork and jerk sauce are AMAZING.   Also, they periodically are outside of their location giving away samples and 20% off coupons. They just began a rewards card for frequent customers, inquire about that!"}
{"text":"The pineapple upside down cake is amazing. Also love the fish tacos and burgers. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place! I eat here almost everyday for lunch! Employees are super friendly. Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Island Chicken Sandwich was HUGE!!!! House side salad was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food tastes ok, I ordered a Hawaiian rice bowl w/ brown rice. The bowl consisted of 80% rice, 10% veggies and 10% chicken. Rice was too hard. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time at Rumbi while visiting my bestie. I had a groupon. The food was awesome. Not expensive and it was delicious. I had the chicken and shrimp rice bowl. I loved the assortment of grilled vegetables. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and delicious food. Great for a laid back night out or take out. Patio seating is perfect on nice nights.  The color scheme and great posters make me miss Maui. The iced tea is amazing and the portions are huge, we always have leftovers. No matter what I get I love it. I'm partial to the chicken rice bowl with Hawaiian teriyaki sauce over Rumbi rice. The rice, beans, and coconut in the Rumbi rice is addicting, you've been warned. Just tried the luau pork for the first time too and loved it. The macaroni salad isn't completely what I like, too tart like normal mac salad and not plate lunch quality, but that's personal preference. Mama's tortilla soup is also incredible, a mix of spicy and savory with a hint of coconut milk.  They're slow on weeknights when we're usually there, hopefully busier on the weekends, I'd hate for them to go anywhere."}
{"text":"Well apparently I have been missing out!  Rumbi is only about 5 minutes from my house and work but I never thought to eat there until this week, at the suggestion of a co-worker.  You know how sometimes you just need to get out of the office for lunch, but you don't have much time... and if you're trying to eat healthy the options get pretty limited.  Rumbi to the rescue!  I had a very good chicken & spinach salad which I was able to customize with no cheese, vinaigrette dressing on the side, etc. so that it was only around 420 calories.  They also had several bowls with lean meat, brown rice, veggies and even sandwiches for around 500 calories.  And the food was tasty, not diet-y!  While we were eating we all wondered, \"why haven't we been having lunch here all along?\"  Situation rectified - Rumbi is on the lunch list from now on."}
{"text":"Rumbi Island Grill is absolutely fantastic! The teriyaki chicken rice bowl is to die for and the serving sizes are great! Just a half bowl fills me up. The burgers and fries are also amazing.  While the food is great, the service is even better! The staff is always very friendly and service is quick. Rumbi has created a lifelong, loyal customer. I always recommend it to friends and family to try!"}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping in. I stopped in at around 8pm to get a to-go dinner for myself. The counter service was friendly and helpful and accurately took my order. I ordered a honey-orange chicken bowl with noodles.  It is unfortunate that I must say the completion time of the order leaves something to be desired.  The restaurant was occupied by 1 large family and 2 smaller families in the restaurant, so it wasn't super busy. But the order took over 15 minutes to be completed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly pleasant! I was in the area, hadn't had lunch, looking for a quick meal but most places I wanted to go was closed as it was not during lunch or dinner hour. This one came up on Yelp search and decided to try.  Very friendly staff welcomed me and took time to explain some of the dishes I was interested in. You order first and they bring food to your table.  Very clean inside. Food was actually not bad at all. I enjoyed my salmon dish with rumbi rice.  I also ordered upside down pinnacle cake. It was a bit sweet but still good.  When I am in the area, I will keep in mind of this place next time.  I was in and out quick and my tummy was happy too."}
{"text":"My favorite casual restaurant and I eat here frequently.  I am not fond of rice so stick to salads.  They will also do \"all salad\" and no rice for the plates..  Love the tofu option and iced tea is always fresh.  The catered salads are beautifully presented. Sign up for club rumbi......"}
{"text":"Love Hawaii. Lived on the North Shore. But, I've always been disappointed with island food. Islanders will eat anything.  All of that fresh, indigenous, tropical food and they eat junk meat.  This place is a little fresher than the real deal, no spam. Its just not different enough. I know that's not what they're trying to appeal to, but I always do my food reviews based on quality not taste or texture."}
{"text":"Um. What did I miss?  They have such great reviews but my experience was just \"meh\".  I provably should have known better then to order entr√©e seafood at a fast food type place, but the picture was really appetizing!  Volcano blackened mahi. Waaaaay too salty. Had to scrape off most of it. The fish underneath was OK fresh. Not ocean fresh, but Arizona fresh. :-)  I had veggies that I thought would be steamed but were definitely stir fried. Also OK fresh.  The biggest let down of this was the \"mango cheesecake\".  I was expecting some kind of mango inside the cheesecake, but, alas, it was just plain old cheesecake with.... get this... \"mango puree\" on the side. It was a thimble full of mango juice. And fake mango juice at that.  *sigh*  I would eat here again, but I will definitely lower the bar before I do."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love their sweet potato fries:) a They are seriously the best. I really like their shrimp and chicken bowls with veggies and rice. I've also tried it with noodles which is good. Great and fast service."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh crispy veggies, excellent service. I love the luau pork, but it's kind of salty, even for me considering I love salty food!  Mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood. I have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it.I like it crispier (or as crispy as you can get tofu:)"}
{"text":"This place is really cute and the service was good. I ordered the Chicken Bowl with all veggies,  no rice with a side of Jamaican Jerk sauce on the side. It was light, fulfilling and pretty good. My colleagues ordered; kalua pork sandwich, spicy chicken noodles and fish tacos. It all looked fairly appetizing...also they didn't leave one bite for anyone, which says a lot. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Staff: Filled with energy, very friendly, they were very quick to help when I stepped up to the counter, when I asked for a to go box I was given a 2 containers with more than enough napkins and forks.   Parking: even at 3:30 in the afternoon the parking was decent.  Food and efficiency: I had the Beach burger, and it was brought out to me in roughly 2 minutes and my soulmates food with it, the freshly cooked sweet potato fries came out within the first 2 bites.  The fires are good, their burgers and buns were amazing. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Good fresh food at a decent price  fries are so-so  Chips and salsa good....sometimes  The tortilla soup is awesome and different, made with coconut milk. Sounds weird, but delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave 3 1/2 stars but seeing as though that's not possible, 4 stars will have to do. The service was pretty good in that the woman taking our order and serving us was friendly. There were a couple issues we (my family) did encounter, one of us ordered sweet potato fries but the fryer wasn't working so we had to settle for regular fries, but the biggest issue was that we got our food one at a time so we weren't able to eat as a family. My mom ordered chips and salsa-which we would expect for it to come before our food- instead it came at the end...when were all full. But, aside from the mishaps I got the Rumbi bbq salad and I thought it was delicious! So I will be back to give this place another chance and feast on what I hope will be another delicious salad :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a year since it opened. I ordered a full pork, steak, and white rice bowl with teriyaki sauce and I some how received a some what small steak and chicken bowl. I told them about it and they said they would remake it for me. They gave us chips and dips on the house for the mistake. When the correct order came out the portions looked like how it was a year ago. Great service."}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp and would say that that the food was definitely worth the rating. Had the grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken breast was thick, moist and tender, served with pineapple and a special tangy sauce.  I also ordered the Rumbi fries which is a combination of regular and sweet potato fries served with Russian dressing. All in all, very good, prompt and friendly service.  About $8.85 for meal, excluding beverage."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon to have lunch. We attempted to order iced tea but the girl at the counter said they haven't brewed it- my fiance and I looked at each othe puzzled why she didn't offer to make some or didn't make any while we were there?..  Our food comes out and my fiance finds a hair in her food. They refunded us one meal but come on, am I really going to eat mine after that?? We left in disgust. I would suggest you look at every bite you take. The cooks obviously aren't wearing hair nets in this place"}
{"text":"Maybe I had a bad experience here because I don't understand why previous yelpers found this place to be noteworthy. It was loud - I guess it doesn't help to be literally surrounded by screaming infants with their mothers who lunch...and let their 2-4 year olds run around.  I just didn't know what to say...but I think the canned chicken in my jamaican jerk caesar says it all. Canned chicken?! If it was grilled, it could have fooled me. I've had canned chicken once in my life and that was when we went camping. I will never forget the taste or the texture...and I found it sitting on my salad. Yuck.  Hubby had the Luau Pork rice bowl. I could tell by the look on his face he wasn't too thrilled with it. Further evidence was him pushing his food away after ten minutes of attempting to eat it.  I guess I expect too much when restaurants claim it's Island food. My father is a complete island boy, right out of Kauai and I've been fortunate enough to have lived on the islands while growing up and baby, this place is truly a repulsive rip off."}
{"text":"Very solid place. My wife's and my salads are consistently good. I especially like the South Seas salad. Dressing is tangy. Greens are crisp and fresh. Added citrus and nuts are a nice touch. The slice of pita with each salad is also an enjoyable adder. My only food criticism is that the chicken is sometimes a little stale. I understand that it would be prohibitive, time-wise, to grill chicken freshly for each order. But the slightly dry texture that you get here someone's needs addressing. Service and friendliness here are top notch."}
{"text":"Good stuff! We visit Scottsdale a few times a year, and while I like this place, my girlfriend is addicted to it. She loves the coconut soup. I have tried the rice bowl, and the fish tacos. My favorite is the fish tacos. They were crispy, yet soft, and had a really good dressing and cabbage mixture on top. Last time we went we ordered the sweet potato fries for the first time, and they will now be on our list every time."}
{"text":"The food is very consistent and good for fast food. A much healthier fast food option. What I really like about this location is how clean and well kept the restaurant is every time I go there. It smells clean, the corners are clean, the condiment containers are never sticky. And if they keep the public areas this clean I am very confident they keep the kitchen spotless. There is also very good staff who are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Excellence is here! Thats what i call restaurant near unlv chillest spot in town if u go school #wolvofficialmusic #austincainmusic #seankennedymusic #djparadice #djp definitely go."}
{"text":"I went to Rumbi Grill tonight with a party of 14, 9 of which were children. The ordering process was quick and on Tuesdays children eat free with every adult meal purchased.  The food was excellent and the service even better.  They pulled tables together for us and as we were getting ready to leave we were stacking our plates,  getting ready to bus our own table when they came buy and explained that they would do it and it was part of their service.  I would never have gone here if not for the suggestion of a friend in our group but we live close and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time and ordered a brown rice bowl with chicken and veggies. The food was made fresh and was very tasty, service was great and prices were reasonable. Looking forward to my next visit so I can try the fish and salads."}
{"text":"Rumbi has been a favorite place in my family for years. We love the fresh island food, and amazing flavor. We usually get the Rice Bowls, and haven't branched too much into the other offerings. (If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?) Their salsa is awesome, a sweeter salsa that has a lot of flavor. It's always worth it to get the full size bowl, because it reheats well and you can have leftovers for days if you don't eat much. Overall, a family favorite that I will keep going to!"}
{"text":"As we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly cashier.  Since it was my friend's first time there, he gave us the run down on their menu. I ordered a half sized rice bowl with luau pork, steak and brown rice and my friend ordered the Oahu fish sandwich special.  You get a number and they bring the food out to your table.  Before our food arrived, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa (their version). The chips were a bit thick and hard but fresh and the salsa was pretty good and mild.    My friend loved her fish sandwich with her mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The fish looked crunchy and the bun was soft. The sweet potato fries were my favorite - they are crinkle cut!    My bowl was abundant with perfectly cooked rice and the highlight was the luau pork, it was divine!   The steak was good but you don't get much of it with the half portion. I loved the veggies - zucchini, carrots and broccoli. I think their rice bowls are much better than Samarai Sam's by far.  SO many choices!!  My only suggestion is for them to not serve so much rice. It's a bit of a waste....I would rather get more veggies. Maybe I will ask next time!  They also gave me two sauces on the side because I couldn't choose between the jerk or the teriyaki. The jerk was a bit salty for my taste but the teriyaki was perfect.  Of course, too much rice and sauce preference is a personal thing ;-)  I am a stickler for iced tea and they had that yummy tropical tea that you usually get at some of the Asian chains.   Overall, the service, atmosphere and food were great! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Nice Hawaiian atmosphere that has a Pacific Island theme that is not cheesy.  Super friendly service. You order at the counter and the warm, fresh food is brought to your table.  During the meal, they came a few times to see if we needed anything else.    We had the Rumbi Beach Burger and Sweet Potato Fries.  The burger came out on french bread, and that alone sold me. Filled with two patties, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, onion and house made thousand island dressing, it really hit the spot.  It had just the right amount of messy drip factor.  The fries were crisp, not greasy, and really satisfying."}
{"text":"Rumbi is probably the most-frequented place in our workday lunch rotation.  I describe it to people as a poor-gal's Tommy Bahama.  The decor is island-ish (squint your eyes really hard and pretend you're on vacation) and the staff is friendly enough to make-believe that you're a guest at a tropical resort.  Okay, maybe that last part is a bit of an overpromise, but a girl can dream...  The hulu salad is really tasty and almost a little too large(I highly recommend asking them to do a spinach/romaine combo), but lately I have been jonesing for the luau pork plate with rumbi rice (pulled pork, coconut rice with red beans, some mac salad and a bit of coleslaw--so yummy, I crave it).  The food is pretty reasonably-priced for what you get, and it's the \"fast casual\" style where you walk up and order and then they bring it out to you.    When you get sick of wraps or sandwiches in the Promenade-area, give Rumbi a try to mix it up.  I think it would be hard to be disappointed.  Aloha!"}
{"text":"This is our first time trying it and we were hoping it would be satisfying... Unfortunately we didn't think it was very good I had the pork luau sandwich and my husband had the kahuna burger ( teriyaki). The rumbi fries were salty and overcooked,  and the burger was lacking flavor. The barbeque sauce was tangy and the fry sauce resembled ketchup and mayo.   On the positive side, the place was well decorated,  clean  And the staff was friendly!! Sorry, we probably won't be coming back tho..."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food with a pretty varied menu sure to please many. Gotta love the retro island decor inside, too. I munched on a rice bowl, filled with crisp veggies, brown rice, and tofu. The teriyaki sauce is very flavorful and just the right amount. The mango iced tea was delicious, too. Friendly staff to boot."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time but I loved what I ordered! It was the Caribbean chicken and shrimp. Fire grill chicken with garlic lime shrimp topped with mango-passion aioli & pineapple salsa. I got mine on top of the Rumbi rice. It was really really good. I would definitely go back for it."}
{"text":"The Kahuna Burger is the best! Anyone that loves island-style food and atmosphere should absolutely give this place a go. The owners are super nice and always accommodating. They make your visit pleasant and enjoyable. It's great to see a newer business bring great food and service to this area!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas! The food here is always amazing. Their rumbi fries with the sauce is to die for. In addition to burgers they have rice plates, salads, and deserts.  The price is fair for the burgers but a bit more pricey for some of their other items, but I believe the taste of the food makes it worth the money. It is right across from UNLV so it does have traffic from students, but the ambience is very chill and relaxing inside. Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Take out is much faster since my last review! Love their Rumbi Stamp card too - who doesn't love free food?!"}
{"text":"Food was good, portion was big and I really enjoyed the aloha mango salad and the rumbi chicken bowl. use a Groupon which made my meal even sweeter. And checked into Yelp for a free large drink.  Fast and healthy food."}
{"text":"This place is so nice! And the food was so delicious! We had the rice bowl with jerk flavor and it was great, the girl let us try the flavors since we had never ate here and weren't familiar with the flavors. I noticed how clean the kitchen was and the guy in the kitchen was working hard to keep it that way. Overall great food and service and the positive attitude of the cashier and cook made for a good first time dining experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My meal was very tasty, but after watching the staff as it was prepared I struggled with eating it.  Sometimes the depth of a situation takes time to register. And astonishment follows. ***Update: Link to Health Code violation at end of review.***  Strike 1: Dark haired 17-20 year old kid takes my order with an air of contempt, like I am an effin imposition. Fire this customer service nightmare ASAFP.   Strike 2: There is an off duty worker in the front service area eating from a ToGo container. He's using a fork.  Strike 3: Over the next 2-3 minutes I notice that every one of the 6 workers visible in the kitchen area are eating, most of them with their hands, including the 40-50 year old guy cooking my food (poor leadership).  It's taken me weeks to post this review. I'm still shaking my head. This place is one surprise food inspection away from being shutdown.  *** Update: And behold their Health Inspection did cite employees eating in inappropriate places, along with improper hand washing, and food storage co-mingling with toxic chemicals. https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-10172&i=4291329 ***  And the food was delicious. What a shame."}
{"text":"Rumbi Island Grill is a small sit-down type of place with island-themed decor adorning the walls and tables. The fun atmosphere combined with the food make it a good time whenever I visit. It's across from UNLV, so it's usually busier during the school year.  I ordered the volcano blackened fish (you can choose between salmon or mahi) which came with salad and your choice of rice.   For this dish, I went with the salmon. The fish was drizzled in this unique-tasting aioli that made the salmon flavor stand out well. It was a bit overcooked, but nothing too noticeable. It was placed on top of a bed of brown rice, which is honestly the perfect pairing to salmon.   The salad that came with it was basic, but the veggies in it were bright and vibrant (so I know it's fresh!). The romaine lettuce had a nice crunch and the tomatoes had a pico de gallo-like taste to it. A few croutons and parmesan cheese were sprinkled on top.  I think it's good for what it is. The prices are decent, you get good portions, and the food is great! This is a viable option for those who are in the area or for those who want some food in between class, but don't want to travel far away from UNLV's campus."}
{"text":"This was my first time dinning here, Cesar greeted us quickly when we walked in and helped us out. We ordered the rice bowl with rumbi rice and  fire grilled chicken and I asked for the spicy teriyaki sauce (good, but not very spicy) . We also ordered the orange chicken, which was crispy and delicious. While we were eating, Cesar checked on us and brought our dessert to us when we were done eating. He was so friendly and professional. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork bowl with teriyaki sauce and brown rice great flavor and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I eat here whenever I'm in Chandler, AZ.. Fresh & Great bowls, blacken Mahi, fish tacos & sweet potato fries. Good mango ice tea as well. Everyone I've turned on to this place is a regular now. A Must Try! You'll love it."}
{"text":"I totally agree w/Kristin!  My husband and I wondered if the same people that brought us Pei Wei brought us Rumbi.  Rumbi, Rumbi, Rumbi!  It's good, good, good.  I got the chicken rice bowl and my husband got a salad.  He was thrilled with the non iceberg lettuce.  We sat and enjoyed the quick service.  The portions are jinormous.  A little chili paste in the rice bowl and you are in business.   On our second visit we shared a chicken sandwich.  The sweet potatoe fries were a hit w/the hubby and it was spiced nicely.  I didn't care for it and will stick to the salad and rice bowls."}
{"text":"Say it ain't so!!! So sad that this place closed down. My coworkers and I were in shock when we arrived today only to see the sign being taken down and everything being packed up. Now we're all in mourning, wondering where we're going to get our rice bowl fix. You will be missed, Rumbi!"}
{"text":"This experience was amazing.  I was talking to my friend about good service before we stopped in and we were blown away by Cesar!!! He was very friendly helped us pick out our meals. He cracked some jokes and at the end of our visit he let us try a new desert. This exceeded my service expectations. Great food and better service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! i wish we had one here in Rancho Cucamonga, CA !!!! I guess I will just come here when I visit my parents move here in Surprise. The staff was awesome. We were here in early May. The manager made sure my husband had a gluten free diet as the doc perscribed. She was so awesome. They came around maybe 6 or 7 times to make sure all was well since the 1st round didnt go so well. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. plus the food was so delicious!! I told my parents about the place and now they come here now. Best in the area!!!!!!So sad you are not in SO CAL :("}
{"text":"Great food! I really enjoyed the different tastes they offer. They have a nice outside area as well that allows the kids to run around ."}
{"text":"Eat lunch and chill out, perfect!   I'd never heard of Rumbi until I got some coupons in the mail (yeah, I said coupons, I'm not ashamed to use them) So I figured we would give it a shot since we were burnt out on all the other local convenient eateries.   It was cool and calm (as in not bustling with people making your lunch suck) inside, I liked the island decor for a change, it was hip, but the best part was the reggae beats pumping through the speakers, LOVED it!   They have several bowls, salads, wraps, sandwiches and burgers to choose from.  But what do they have for vegans you ask?   Well this Vegan got the Organic Tofu bowl (see pics), with teriyaki sauce and the Rumbi rice which is rice and red beans simmered in coconut milk, so delicious! I got the half size and it was still two portions for me.  A lot of food lightly dressed in the sauce with zucchini, carrots, celery and broccoli that was not overcooked.   It was much fresher, much tastier and not greasy compared to a Pei Wei bowl.   We shared some Rumbi fries too(see pics), half sweet potato and half regular, solid choice, nice and crisp.   The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was very clean.  It's nice to know I have another accidentally vegan option out there, I will go back."}
{"text":"First time here I ordered the Caribbean  chicken and shrimp its so yummy.  I will come again great flavor."}
{"text":"This was a very good experience overall. The steak was soft and marinated, the pork was excellent, and I usually never eat the veggies but I could help it because they were so fresh. I am really happy I came here and I have to bring my family. Their volcano fries are good too if you like spicy, they put chili powder on them like Turkish fries."}
{"text":"Rumbi is located right across from Student Union so it is convenient for UNLV students to grab a quick bite. What's even better was that Rumbi offers coupons which are included in the coupon book that UNLV gives out few times a year. With the coupon, I was able to get 20% off my entire order.   I am not too sure of the concept but they seem to offer Hawaiian food with healthier option. Menu was simple with few options of burgers, salads and rice bowls. Rice bowls are customizable and you get to choose rice/brown rice, along with different protein and sauce. I got the steak rice bowl which was $8 and some change for their half size. Portion was generous. Steak was cooked medium to well-done and came with steamed vegetables. I appreciated the fact that they put sauce on the side because I was able to put sauce to my liking.    I opted for their teriyaki sauce to go with my rice bowl, which according to the server is their most popular choice for sauce. It was sweet and a little tangy. I usually don't like too much sauce on any dish in general but I ended up using the whole container of sauce and still felt like I needed more flavor. I also wish that their steak was cooked more on the rare side than well done but that was probably my fault for not telling them how I wanted my steak to be cooked.   Service was slow but friendly. My rice bowl was freshly prepared but took a good 20 min to come out. With other good nearby Hawaiian joints, Rumbi is definitely not my favorite choice. 20% off coupon did redeem my experience somewhat but I don't see myself coming back here. They also offer a free large soft drink with a yelp check-in."}
{"text":"Great value....love their Kahuna burger with pineapple and swiss ! Try their fish tacos and sweet potato fries. All good options."}
{"text":"This is one of few places I enjoy that never disappoints me. I have enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there and I've tried almost everything on the menu. The service is great and I'm always greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy. I was starving, actually I was HANGRY and remembered this place was here. My husband and I came with our 2 kids. We have never eaten here before but I had eaten it catered it at my office. When we came in we were a little overwhelmed by the menu but were highly helped by Rick who gave us the too 3 options.  1) Cajun Chicken and Shrimp 2) Luau pork sandwich on a wheat bun  3) Voodoo salad with Steak   We ordered 1 and 3. Our kids had Mac n Cheese and Teriyaki Chicken. (KIDS EAT FREE ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY AFTER 4 ).   Our meal arrived 10 minutes after ordering. It was delicious!!!! Our voodoo salad came with chicken instead but Rick was nice enough to comp our next meal. I can't wait to try the steak next time though.  The Cajun Chicken and shrimp was so good my husband didn't even put hot sauce on it (HE puts hot sauce on everything!!!!).   We just found our Monday spot!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice on trips to visit a friend in the area. LOVE this place! Took the boyfriend on the second trip and he also enjoyed it. The big bowl is enough food for two meals. Thinking of relocating to Phoenix and I'm pretty excited at the idea of trying more food options from this place. :)"}
{"text":"Came to Rumbi for dinner with my 9 year old. The ambience was nice and the service great! We had our Rumbi fries in minutes. Our meal came a couple minutes after the fries. Fries were good but not hot fresh like right out of frier. I really like the fries sauce. Very sweet and smooth in texture.  Meals presentation is very good. My fish tacos \"Cabo Fish Tacos\" had a nice spread of color! They tasted great, but wished there was a bit more fish in the taco. The Rumbi rice is a sticky rice with herbs and beans. Taste today was ok. My 9 year old got kids meal Cheese Burger. That burger was huge and thick in cheese. He was full and so was I. Overall good experience! Not my first time and I will continue to return. If you like burgers this place makes them fresh and huge."}
{"text":"I love eating here- although i'd eventually like to try the entire menu, my mouth waters so badly at a few items I can't do without! You order at the counter then get a number, and your food is brought out to you in real dishes.   My favorites:  Luau Pork- decent portion of meat served over rice (I suggest the rumbi coconut/red bean rice) with some creamy macaroni salad. I don't care for the sauce it comes with by default, but instead I ask for the Orange Chicken Sauce.   Kahuna burger- a perfectly cooked explosion of delicious! It has two thin beef patties, swiss cheese, and pineapple. The combination of things, along with some mayo and a sweet squishy bun, is incredibly addictive. It comes with some sauce but i've never used it..better yet, it comes with:  RUMBI FRIES: A tasty mix of regular fries and seasoned sweet potato fries. One time they even let me have all sweet potato fries, now THAT made me a happy customer. :) They come with a sauce that i'm pretty sure is just ketchup and mayo mixed together. I hardly ever eat fries but can't get enough of these.  Key Lime Pie: It's very limey, you get a large slice. Perhaps not top notch, but better than what you can easily find in the area.  I've never tried the entree salads, but once asked for a side caesar that was fairly large and did not disappoint. I've also had the brown rice but prefer the mix of the rumbi rice.   If you check your junk mail, they send out coupons quite often. Rumbi is fantastic for a quick casual meal or take out!"}
{"text":"My husband who eats and enjoys almost any meal was underwhelmed with the Kahuna burger.  I ordered a veggie rice bowl that was too long in being brought out to our table and had mushy, crisp and under cooked veggie's on white rice. Couldn't even eat half of it, it was that bad. The cashier was curt and in a hurry for us to order even though there were no customers behind us. They brought my husband's burger out before my rice bowl.  He would have been finished before I ever got my food if he hadn't stopped to wait for my food to come."}
{"text":"Rumbi is conveniently located right by UNLV so it's already a plus in my book. I've gotten Groupons here before, so I've checked it out a few times.  I don't think you can go wrong with a rice bowl. The rumbi rice is excellent and both their chicken and pork are great with the rice. I've experimented with some of the sauces, like the spicy Hawaiian and I haven't found one I didn't like. The $8 you usually pay with a rice bowl scares off some folk, but I think for the quality, it's not asking too much.  The customer service is always excellent there. The staff is very concerned with making sure you have all your needs met. I've had the manager introduce himself and actually take my order. I like the effort that is put into meeting the people eating your food. Shows that you care and want people to come out.  I will say that last time I came in to eat, the food came out quicker than it normally does. It wasn't as fresh as some of the other times I've had it. Just brushing that off as an anomaly as normally every time I eat there, you can tell they just cooked your food.  Rumbi is a nice diversion from the standard fare they have around the university and it should be one of the places to highly consider if you are trying to get some decent lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fall-apart tender, super  rich and flavorful pork, perfectly cooked and seasoned rice, creamy and tangy macaroni salad. Just an overall spectacular meal (and HUGE too!) for under 10 bucks. I got the luau pork plate. Definitely recommended. Super fast too! Like 3 minutes fast! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had rumbi tonight and it was so good! I am in love with the Jamaican jerk caesar salad! The rice bowls are always good. We also had really great service and the general manager Dago is a really great nice guy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love rumbi always clean, willing to accept my picky orders  and friendly workers. Food is good as well love the rumbi fry sauce"}
{"text":"The prices of the sandwiches made me stop and check this place out. I got the pulled pork and it moist. mmmm.. the sauce was served on the side and glad they do that. If pork is cooked right then let the meat do the talking.  The soup and salad combo is worth looking into. I will definitely be back here again, and they gave me a $3 coupon to make sure i  do come back  soon."}
{"text":"I can't seem to tear myself away from the fish tacos to try something else. They're THAT good. Whoever's writing bad reviews has not tried them. And their beans and rice. YUM. Great service. Love them."}
{"text":"Lunch today: Caribbean chicken & shrimp. Sliced grilled chicken breast and shrimp on a bed of rice (I chose brown) with sauce and salsa, and salad.  Good amount of food for the price, nothing overcooked, place was clean, music was appropriate and not too loud. Parking is a bit limited--their corner of the lot seems popular."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted right away upon entering. You order and pay, then find your seat and your order is brought out to you. I ordered the Island Chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Our order was brought out in a reasonable time. The sandwich was huge. It had a huge chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, grilled pineapple, Swiss cheese, sliced red onion and mayo served on a fresh baked bun. In my opinion the chicken was dry, but over all the sandwich was good. I tried cutting the sandwich in half and it fell apart, so I ended up eating most of it with a knife and fork. The sweet potato fries were very good. Not overly salty. This dish was served with a side of teriyaki sauce. The decor reminded me of a little cafe we visited while on our honeymoon in Honolulu. There are pictures of the Island, and Island themed decor. There was Island music playing which added to the Island experience. The restaurant was clean and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I like this place , it's a little on the pricey side for fast food , but it's all made fresh and really delicious !! I've been here twice , first time was just a fluke , as I was hungry and getting a haircut in the area ,but second time was to specifically eat here , because the food was so good !! I got a bowl each time with a combo of meat , first time Kalua pork & grilled chicken , second time chicken and sirloin , warning tho if you are a meat lover they are a little skimpy on the proteins , but the veggies and rice are top notch !! The Kalua pork was tender and delish , the beef was very tasty , as for the chicken first time the chicken was fresh and juicy , second time was a bit over cooked , maybe recooked? As for portion ,the large is very ample & I left some rice , ( think the large is only 1$ more , but don't really expect more meat , just more rice and veggies !! Lol , (first time was the small , second time was a large) as for sauces they steal the show !! Had both versions of the teriyaki , and spicy is just subtlety so , really want to go back and try the peanut sauce ! As for service I have had the same girl at counter both times and she is very friendly and efficient , the wait for food tho is a bit long , but hey it comes out nice and hot ! If eating there you do have to , stop at the condiment counter and pick up your own silverware and condiments or else you will have to get up and leave your delish  bowl on the table and delay your grub on !! Lol  their ordering system is cool , as they bring the food to you on real plates & real silver ( that you get ) but as both times there it was slow ,  I wonder how well it will stand up to a busy day? But definetly  check it out !!"}
{"text":"Yummy, the kids love the food, it is prepared fresh and delicious. The sweet potato fries are so good here, hamburgers are huge. I watched the employee walk and assist a disabled person into their car and was super impressed with their customers service and kindness.  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"This place has a very interesting menu, with a decent selection of salads, burgers, and rice bowls. For the bowls, you get to choose your meat, your style of rice, and the sauce.  I went with a bowl. I got the chicken, with Rumbi Rice which is flavorful, and the Jamaican Jerk sauce. The portions were huge, the dish was very tasty - BUT incredibly salty!!  I might go back to try something different (the Kahuna Burger sounds interesting) but if it's anywhere near as salty as this one, I won't go back."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant where I spit the food back out. What I bought was a terriyaki chicken bowl with rice and noodles with veggies. It tasted like a boxed microwave diet dinner. Cubed chicken, frozen veggies, spaghetti noodles from a box id buy at the store, and sauce I could make ten times better in my own home. If a place can mess up such an easy dish, then it's poor quality. There's nothing Hawaiian about this place. The customer service was nice, but that's about it.  Go to jack in the box for their terriyaki bowl to save money."}
{"text":"For the mid price lunch above fast food, Rumbi is the boss for good ingredients and choice. Non-soda options are pretty good too.    The pineapple upside down cake is awesome!"}
{"text":"This location has been my go-to spot for lunch during the work week. The service is always friendly and the food has yet to let me down. The workers have always been attentive, even after receiving your order. I recommend the Hawaiian teriyaki spicy chicken bowl. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I loved coming here for their tasty Rumbi fries! Also their rice bowls are delicious! You customize it to fit your taste. They also have mango ice tea and cool jams playing.  I feel right at home here. The place is always clean, service is quick and friendly. The only thing that sucks is the parking. There is like 5 other restaurant in the area so finding good parking is a chore.   I recommend the mango cheesecake, Rumbi fries, and rice bowl with spicy teriyaki sauce. Guzzle it down with mango ice tea!"}
{"text":"So good!!!!! It was amazing the steak was cooked to perfection and the rumbi rice is spectacular and the atmosphere was amazing the waiter smiled he recommended what was his favorite when we didn't know what to get. All I'm saying is that rumbi grill is amazing and a lot of people should go here if they want good food!!!and I'm in love with this place!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't like giving bad reviews but his food is just not good. We all got the teriyaki chicken bowls - my husband thought his veggies tasted dirty and my daughter barely ate hers. I honestly didn't think the taste too bad, but my tummy hurt a ton when I got home!! Was hoping to find a good place for  teriyaki chicken, but we won't be back! On a side note, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rumbi for about 2 years now as it is across the street from where I work. They offered Groupons quite often and I had a lunch buddy that always enjoyed the fact that they had a tofu option as she is a vegetarian. That buddy moved away so I hadn't been there for a while. I went last week and I realized that some little thing shave changed.   I always order a rumbi rice teriyaki chicken bowl, the large kind so I can split it into two meals. I am used the veggies in the bowl being slightly crisp and this time they were soggy and the whole meal  seemed extra saturated in oil. I was a little nervous when my meal came out only about 2 minutes after ordering when it usually would take a little while longer but would taste much fresher.   I always order water and they used to give big blue glasses and now the complimentary water comes around in a little plastic cup. I guess I got used to the old way that I had it and considered it to be a nice little touch to a fast casual place. It may be that some people were taking advantage of the free water cup and when hog wild on some soda.   The customer service continues to be spot on. The staff are always welcoming and accommodating. I do not think it will be enough to have me go to this spot again unless I have a coupon or discount because the rice bowl ends up being close to $10 and soggy veggies just will not do."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent and the price is good for what you get. Usually come here for a quick bite during lunch."}
{"text":"I normally do not ready review right after going to a restaurant but I definitely have to go ahead and do so here. I purchased a Groupon which gave me $16 worth of food for only $8(Which today 7/11/13 is still available!) . Today I forgot my lunch so I decided to go on my lunch break;  I ventured down Maryland Parkway to this restaurant. I normally go to Cafe Rio so this was a nice change.  Upon entering it is a somewhat island themed restaurant with really nice colors. I really like how they use the past out along with the dark brown wood for their seating. I looked at the menu and they had a plethora of different food selections that you could choose. Although I looked at all of the photos on Yelp and they all look delicious I decided on the volcano chicken sandwich with regular French fries and iced tea.  The volcano chicken sandwich is topped with Swiss cheese, cilantro Mayo, pineapple salsa, lettuce, and red onions. The chicken itself has a seasoning on it and is a rather large piece of chicken. It is perfectly grilled and placed in a delicious white bun. Now this bun is not your typical bun, it is a delicious artisan tight bun that is perfect for the large portion of chicken that they place inside of it , along with all of the garnishments that come on your sandwich.  I got to work and took my first bite and I was literally shocked. The chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked and juicy, I didn't even have to put salt on it. For those of you who know me, I put salt on everything even before I taste it, it's a very nasty habit, LOL.  The regular French fries or cooked perfectly and seasoned really well, I didn't try the  sweet potato fries  but they they looked delicious. I opted for a drink and the cup you get you can bring back and I believe its only $0.25 for a refill the next time you come. I chose the iced tea and I lemon, I really liked the tea, it tasted kinda like hibiscus or a mango, super yummy!!  I def reccommend going here and trying out their sandwiches, they also have daily specials during the week which include a drink!!"}
{"text":"All My friends love this place... So I went along on a lunch trip and walked into a very busy restaurant walk up to the counter and ordered the Luau Pork Plate (Slow roasted pulled Kalua pork topped with teriyaki sauce. Served with creamy Island macaroni salad, Asian slaw and white rice. With an order of the Rumbi Fries A mix of sweet potato & regular French fries, with Rumbi Fry Sauce. I was not impressed with my meal at all it was ok and the fried were ok as well. I will not be going back to this spot for lunch anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice change from fast food! Healthy options that are still quick and the teriyaki chicken was great"}
{"text":"I forgot to bring my lunch to work and I was tired of the usual places so I decided to check Rumbi's out.  There was one person in front of me in line but no one at the counter to help either of us.  We waited for a couple minutes and then a woman came out and started helping the lady in front of me.  She seemed very friendly and apologized to both of us for the wait.  Then a guy came out from the back and went to a second register and motioned to me that he could help me.  Since this was my first time here I asked him if he had any recommendations for what was good and I swear he rolled his eyes at me.  Didn't exactly give me a great impression of the place.  He mentioned a couple things but at that point I honestly didn't care what he said so I just picked the Island Chicken Sandwich with the Jerk sauce to go.  It didn't take long for them to make my food which was nice since I was on my lunch break and time is precious!  Once I sat down to eat it I was happy with the presentation and the flavors were good too.  The bun was nice and soft, the chicken was cooked nicely and it was a huge piece too!  Not to mention the flavor combination of the grilled pineapple with the jerk sauce and cheese was great.  I'm not writing this place off due to this experience since it wasn't completely horrible and the food was good, but I'll definitely be hoping I get the woman who works there and not this guy again."}
{"text":"The food is always good, the service is always friendly, and the restaurant is always clean. What else can a bearded man ask for? Five stars."}
{"text":"This review is for the two times that I've visited Rumbi Island Grill. So I heard about Rumbi's grand opening through the BOGO coupon that my boyfriend had acquired earlier in the week. We decided to try it out since we were nearby UNLV and they are located just next to Rebelbooks.   ATMOSPHERE: Outside of the restaurant they had someone passing out samples of some kind of teriyaki flavored beef with rice. Very inviting. Inside, the Hawaiian-themed walls and decorations were nice and not at all reminiscent of the garish-colored Hawaiian t-shirts.  FOOD: Kind of on the expensive side if it not were for our BOGO coupons. The first time we went we had the Cabo Fish Tacos and the Kahuna Burger. Both portions were huge and full of flavor. The well-seasoned fish tacos had some kind of tropical salsa and came with coconut rice and the burger was juicy and the pineapple inside matched perfectly with the teriyaki sauce. The SECOND visit... Was not as good as the first visit however. This time we both tried their salads and was disappointed with flavor and portion sizes that matched the $8 price. The Aloha Chicken Salad had almost no flavor unless you drenched it in dressing, which I chose not to do. The Jamaican Jerk Caesar Salad was also bland, and that would be including the chicken and dressing.   SERVICE: The service the first week was great. A couple weeks later during our second visit, the girl at the cash register was very nice, but the guy manager seemed a little bit on the hurried side when answering my questions and didn't make me feel as welcome.  Overall, I say stick to the recommended burgers and the entrees, as they will be filling and satisfying. Everything else is too small portioned for the expensive prices."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and it was just as good the second time around.  The service was fast and friendly and the food was really good.  I had the Aloha Salad which was listed as one of their favorites.  It was filling and full of flavor.  I will say that now a days forking over close to $9 for a salad is tough for me but the atmosphere, music and free WiFi made up for it."}
{"text":"So, my number one Jewish girlfriend took me to this place that she just knew would make me feel at home.  She was trying to make up for a momentary lapse in judgement about what was the most important thing to do on May Day...Anyhooo... She is now fully pardoned!  Rumbi made me miss my momma when I got a whiff of their Caribbean Chicken and Shrimp entree.   This with a side of Rumbi fries made me want to forget that I was at a strip mall in the dessert and was instead at a get-a-way somewhere between Maui and Montego Bay!  Don't ask how that is possible. Ask instead how I managed to eat the rumbi rice down to the last grain without ever mentioning curry goat.  This island fusion blend made this island gal feel like she should have had her  mom open up a franchise and add a few more menu items.  Don't get me wrong; if you wanted to be in Hawaii, you know this place had it covered.  But a little more of the Caribbean could have been represented is all that I am saying.  So to remedy that, add curry!  Add echoveiche fish and plantains!  Perhaps some carrot juice....  Either way,  who needs Jack in the Box EVER when you have this festive fast food fix frankly?"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Hawaiian food! I come here very often and always enjoy it. By far, the best thing to get, especially if it's your first time in, is a rice bowl. There is a lot of variety in them! You can choose the meat and sauce, either white rice, brown rice, rumbi rice (rice cooked with coconut and red beans), or noodles, and it comes with cooked veggies. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken with white rice. I would also recommend getting the full size bowl since it is almost double the size for only about a dollar more. I can usually eat half and take the rest home!  The macaroni salad is very good and I would definitely choose this over the coleslaw, which doesn't have a lot of flavor in my opinion. The sweet potato fries & fry sauce are a must-try. The pork is also very delicious.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice and relaxed but has the feel of a sit down place. The workers are all very nice and extremely helpful! They have been great every time I stop in.  I bring friends and family all the time, and they always love it! In general a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I usually love eating at this place. Unfortunately the hours are posted wrong though. We went to have dinner there tonight and they were closed before 9. Very disappointing when you have a craving!"}
{"text":"LOVE RUMBI! Their food is always fresh, delicious, and quick! Best part is they have a student discount as long you show your student ID ;)"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we've been here.  Last time was in May 2013.  My husband has been a Rubio's kick for months now but I just couldn't go to Rubio's as much as I love them because we've been there TOO many times.  After we dropped the kids off at karate, we decided to go to the Val Vista & Baseline area to see what there was to eat that was different.  My husband is super picky and really doesn't like to try new places.  He thought I was tricking him, but I assured him that we had been there once before.  When we stepped into the place, it was probably just starting to get a little busy.  Not a  problem.  There was an older woman that helped up and advised us, which was super helpful.  I wasn't very hungry and just wanted a salad, but more than a side salad.  She said I could always get a regular salad and half that.  They would bring me out half and To Go the other half.  Perfect.  She said all the salads were good and they allow for changes and substitutions.    So, I got the Aloha Mango Salad with pulled pork.  They put the dressing on the side, which was wonderful, because the pork had so much flavor, I didn't need much dressing.  It was so delish.  My husband got the Luau Pork Place with Rumbi Rice (this is a coconut rice with red beans).  It came with some island macaroni salad, pulled pork, an Asian slaw, and the Rumbi Rice.  My husband doesn't like slaw, so he gave this to me.  I love slaw, but I didn't care for this too much as it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  It needed more sauce or something.  The rice was very coconuty flavor.  We LOVE coconut and it had just enough red beans.  There was also a side of teriyaki sauce, which my husband didn't need to put too much as it was super sweet.  We also ordered their Rumbi fries, which is a mixture of sweet potato fries and regular straw like fries, with a slightly spicy like sauce that appeared to be like a mixture of Russian & Thousand Island.  It was good, but we used sparingly.  The sweet potato fries were so yummy and the best I've ever had.  Normally I don't like sweet potato fries, but I loved these.  These even beat out Joe's Farm Grill's sweet potato fries.  Not greasy at all.  The fries was a really big portion for $3.  I only had 1/2 a salad, water with lemon, some of the fries and a little of my husband's food.  Was totally stuffed.  The portions are pretty good, but thankfully not like Claim Jumper's.  The food is delicious and very colorful.  The staff is very friendly and helpful, great attitude and wonderful customer service.  The place was clean.  And though we sat somewhat near the door, I didn't feel the coldness of the outside come in when anyone opened the door, so that was good.  It was a lovely date with great food.  We'll have to bring the kids here as it says kids eat free after 4 pm on Monday/Tuesday.  I wonder what age they mean by kids, as we have an 11 and a 14 year old.  Hope it's 15 and under.  :)"}
{"text":"Can someone please explain to me what the hype is about this chain? I will take you out for a drink if you have a compelling argument - Or perhaps you can make some good suggestions to me if I find myself here again?!   When my work first relocated to this area, my coworkers were on a serious Rumbi kick. Like, 2-3 times per week and even ordering it for field trainings.  So, one day a few of us that hadn't tried it out yet decided to go!   The first time I had a half-order of the Honey-Orange Chicken Bowl with brown rice. It kind of reminded me of Panda Express. Nothing too crazy. The \"fresh saut√©ed\" vegetables were soaked in the sauce. Lawl!   Second time I had the Caribbean Jerk Salad. The marinade on the chicken was pretty good; however, the lettuce wasn't very crisp and seemed like it had been sitting around for a day.   Third time, I had the Volcano Chicken Sandwich. The chicken was kind of dry; lukewarm even. However, the cilantro mayo helped out and was actually quite flavorful. The pineapple salsa wasn't horrible, either!   The food is two stars. But since everyone working here was incredibly helpful and friendly, have to throw them the third star for simply for that.   Maybe these were the wrong things to order. Needless to say after this review . . . Not impressed!"}
{"text":"I picked up rice up bowl with shrimp. I got home and opened up the food and started eating. The rice was not cooked at all, it was hard as rocks. It wasn't edible at all. I ended up throwing away the whole bowl. Seriously, who sells uncooked rice bowl? Sauce and everything else was okay but there is a reason why it's called rice bowl. They need to cook their rice. If you can't chew on it, you know there is a problem. I just wasted money..."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken bowl w/ noodles and spicy teriyaki sauce.  There really was no vegetable variation, other than a couple pieces of broccoli and a large sum of zucchini slices.  The teriyaki sauce was good, but the chicken resembled the disgusting frozen meat that is packaged in frozen dinners from Safeway.  Gross.  The noodles were NOT noodles.  When I order noodles, I am expecting a type of island or Asian noodle.  What I received was spaghetti pasta.  WTF!?  I thought this place was called Rumbi ISLAND Grill, not Olive Garden!  Inexcusable.  I threw the entire thing away, which cost me around $10, because apparently spaghetti pasta costs more than rice!  What a terrible restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been here before. This visit I ordered my usual, fire roasted chicken with brown rice and veggies. Chicken was cooked perfectly as well as the veggies but I felt that the rice was under cooked. Little disappointed."}
{"text":"I gott the kahuna burger it was mediocre good flavor and bun but was a little soggy same with fries ...I checked in got my free shrimp tempura wich was good but the macaroni salad was the worst I've ever had,no flavor at all"}
{"text":"This place was alright. I ordered the kahuana burger with rumbi fries and the burger was good but the teriyaki sauce is a bit sweet tasted like maple syrup. And the fries were over cooked. Also the fries had a fishy taste to them probably cause they use the same fryers to fry fish. The prices are good so maybe we'll come back one day. Best thing we did have was a pineapple cake. I would go back just for the cake."}
{"text":"Salty Salty Salty and bland.  Not to mention, watching the employee eat out in the dining room, while obviously oogling at women as they walked by was a big thumbs down.  How tasteless."}
{"text":"This is like more of a burger joint then anything.  Today I'm trying the mango salad and shared some Rumbi fries with Jesse N.  He got the Luau burger I think that was what it was called, it was like Kalua Pork sandwich.  Well, I got the salad because I'm saving those calories for dessert.  I got my eyes on the mango cheesecake.    They are located right across UNLV.  Cute spot, reminds me of a haole version of Kuuaina's back home (I don't mean that in a bad way).   Let me start off with Rumbi had served us with great customer service.  They were very attentive and suggested things on the menu since it was our first time.  Mango salad was pretty monstrous,  if your not a fan of blue cheese, you should ask for no cheese (I like blue cheese).  The mango was cut into itty bitty pieces.  They mix the salad dressing into the salad.  I think having the option to pour it on ourselves would be a better suggestion.  Rumbi fries are perfect for those that want to get a mixture of both Sweet potato (crinkled) fries and regular fries.  Which I am one who can't decide between the two.  Its not out of this world, but convenient for an undecided person like me.  Suggestion however, not to add too much salt.  I might ask for the fries without salt next time.    Jesse N.  said the burger was okay, again said it was a bit too salty.  When he got his first one it wasn't that hot so he did return it to have it heated up.  But they were very kind and gave him a new one & made sure that he came back to enjoy another meal.  I didn't try the burger, just the meat from his burger.  Jesse will review it for himself.    Mango Cheesecake was delicious.  A cheesecake with Mango sauce drizzled atop.  Just the right size to share between the 2 of us.  I forgot to mention, their Ice Tea is delicious.  I went back to refill my cup before I left.  I love tea and having a tropical tea flavored one makes it even better.    Am I going to return, sure.  This place has a lot of potential to make it better."}
{"text":"Dined with my boys last night. While waiting in line, a woman in front of us was giving the cashier Cesar the third degree for supposedly dropping her call earlier. He tried to explain nicely what happened but she had to have the last word. Props to Cesar for handling the situation with grace. Oh...our food was awesome. We always get the blackened mahi with Rumbi rice. I tried the luao pork sandwich which I enjoyed. The sweet potato fries is a staple for us. We go here as a family about every month. Always great service."}
{"text":"Rumbi is a great place for a quick bite before class! They have a great staff and a reasonable amount of seating.    I recommend trying the aloha tacos and the Caribbean shrimp. They're so delicious and flavored really well. The best part is probably their unique aioli sauce!! I like a little kick so just grab some hot sauce they have available.  Its the perfect touch!"}
{"text":"Rumbi rice bowls are always on point! I love how much you get for your money. It's a great college budget joint. I usually order luau pork with Hawaiian teriyaki spicy with brown rice half portion and I get stuffed! So much meat, rice and veggies! I love it!"}
{"text":"Cheap, good, \"Hawaiian\" food.   Until this place opened, there were really only a few choices for \"Hawaiian\" food. Roy's Hawaiian Fusion is an interesting option, but you begin to lose interest when you see the prices on the menu. This place serves as an amazing, cheap alternative.  Okay, maybe its not your cheap $5-7 lunch, its just a tad bit more depending on what you get. I got the combo entree which had shrimp and chicken, rice, and a small salad. Before I talk about the food, let me reiterate my hate for seafood and shrimp. I just don't like it for some reason. This place's shrimp is one of the few places I will eat shrimp. Its the seasoning that makes the texture of shrimp bearable for me. Likewise, the chicken also has a really unique taste. If you want tingly taste buds and want something unique, try this place out. Service is good, food is interesting, and you get quite a bit of food for what you pay."}
{"text":"My second time here and my second time getting the Kahuna burger. I don't remember it being so greasy the first time so I don't know why it was so greasy the second time. :( this is more of a preference but one star off!  Albeit the burger was too greasy for me to even finish, the potato fries are delicious! I'm not really a huge sweet potato fries fan, but I am a fan of theirs! The cashier that took my order in this visit wasn't as friendly as the last but she still greeted with a smile so that's good!  They also give stamp cards and coupons if you're into that, haha."}
{"text":"Stepped into the Rumbi Island Grill for lunch. The interior is cute with fake palm trees and other island themed decor. The menu is on a digital screen and there are a lot of different options for you to choose from. I decided on a half bowl of luau pork with jerk sauce and white rice.  The meal arrived quickly, and had a nice presentation. There was a good balance of veggies and meat and the bowl had enough rice to go with it. The pork and sauce was too salty for my tastes though so I had to eat it with a lot of the rice and veggies to dilute out the saltiness.  At lunchtime it was moderately busy, not overly crowded. In addition to inside seating, there's a nice little patio for eating outdoors."}
{"text":"Mmm on the luau luau plate and the key lime pie! I'll be back to try other items for sure."}
{"text":"This place has a great Hawaiian twist to their menu. I've been here twice; the first time I had the Luau Pork Sandwich, which is a kalua pig sandwich made with cole slaw. It was surprisingly tasty! I make kalua pig at home all the time, so I know what it should taste like. The second visit I had the Kahuna Burger, which is made with teriyaki sauce, pineapple, and some veggies. It was surprisingly tasty as well! For the burgers (which are pretty big), you have the option of ordering their Rumbi fries, which are crinkled sweet potato fries served with regular fries (I just wish the ratio of Rumbi fries to regular fries was higher). The sauce that comes with the fries is also very good!  The interior is bright, clean, and modern, with splashes of Hawaiian art, although the space is a bit on the small side. The staff is nice and very helpful. They were also very patient as we took our time deciding on what to order.  Overall, I give Rumbi's a 5 star rating based on the menu, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the helpful staff."}
{"text":"From the shores of Hawaii, award winning sandwiches come crashing to the desert shores of Las Vegas the Ninth Island at Eastern at Serene like a tidal wave. Except here the shoreline is the sidewalk that wraps around the Walmart-anchored shopping center.      Las Vegas is a melting pot of cuisine from the shores of the world. This makes the Ninth Island an interesting place to explore restaurants. On my exploration of Hawaiian restaurants, my mind had been set on Rumbi Island Grill. Twice in recent times, Rumbi Island Grill went from mind to experience.      Rumbi Island Grill is relatively new to the Ninth Island. This location, the second one in Las Vegas opened this past summer. For several previous summers, Rumbi Island Grill has been popular in Utah where the majority of their locations are. In essence, Rumbi Island Grill is a Utah dining experience exported to Las Vegas. And their sandwiches made for a pleasant dining experience.      Upon scanning their menu, it appeared that they specialize in rice bowls. But life in the world of dining out can be kind of funny. From several experiences it appears that restaurants that promote one cruise such as Outback with steak or Nathan's with hotdogs; serve outstanding burgers and sandwiches. Rumbi Island Grill was the latest.       On visit one, I ordered the Kahuna Burger. This burger creation seemed to be the size of a football. This was a Super Bowl worthy burger sized burger. I tasted the two USDA ground beef patties marinated in teriyaki sauce, with the Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions topped off with a pineapple. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to return to Rumbi Island Grill. Fast forward to a week later, and I was inside exploring the Island Chicken sandwich. I liked the Island Chicken sandwich more than the Kahuna Burger. This thing was huge. Biting into this is like opening your mouth wide when the dentist is about to x-ray your teeth. My pictures below compliment this picture that I am putting into words. Between the patties were grilled chicken breast, Swiss cheese, red onion, mayonnaise, and in Island Grill fashion a pineapple. Both times that I dined here, I combo sized them into a meal. This added a fountain drink and rumbi fries. Rumbi fries are a mix of sweet potato and regular fries. A unique sauce that looks like thousand Island compliments the fries. The admission for this dining experience both times was around $11 and change.       To begin the dining experience, you enter a line that looks like ropes and poles from a ship. Before arriving at the counter, there are menus. The first time dining here, it could be overwhelming. The employees were happy to help. Upon paying for the food, they present you with a stamp card that eventually leads to a complimentary meal. Subsequently to paying, you find a table, pour your Coke beverage and take in the Hawaiin motif. There are Hawaii pictures and the music of the tropic provides a dining soundtrack. I was overhearing reggae and Jimmy Buffet to the degree that I was thinking this could be a restaurant from the Caribbean islands. They brought the food to the table on plates that they took off the table when I was done. The cheerful employees would check up on me. Both times I would leave Rumbi Island Grill full with just enough room in my stomach for the after dinner cup of Starbuck's coffee."}
{"text":"The people who work here are very friendly. Great food at great prices. Quantity and quality is always a great value. Chicken bowl is not over cooked at all. Veggies are clean and crisp. The restaurant is Very clean spotless . You can tell That the staff truly cares. You can use your receipt to use after 4:00 pm within 5 days to get 50% off a meal. Impressive !! I really like that savings."}
{"text":"Closed already?? 2 days and door is locked, lights out and sign on door says \"closed\"."}
{"text":"Good food with good flavor! Decided to give this place a try. It's located right across from UNLV.   I ordered the voodoo salad with steak unfortunately it came to me with chicken but I like chicken too so I went with it. The salad was large with lots of depth and flavor. The chicken was very tender too. I also ordered a island Mac salad as a side. Some of the pasta wasn't cooked all the way and it didn't have any flavor. I'd definitely tell you to pass on that one. My fianc√© got the teriyaki burger which was on point. Big burger with a juicy pineapple in it. Amazing flavor. I loved the sweet potato fries. The regular fries were a bit too salty though. The rumbi fries are just a combination of sweet potato and regular fries.   I'd definitely give this place another go. Would love to try out their rice bowls next time."}
{"text":"one of my favorites.  food is good, atmosphere is good.  one of the few places that tries and succeeds in bringing the islands home to arizona."}
{"text":"The food here is island inspired and the decor and music went along with the food. We really enjoyed it! My boyfriend had the beach burger and I had the island chicken sandwich. The burger was juicy and topped high with fresh veggies and a toasted bun. The chicken was actually quite thick and also really moist, and was also topped with fresh tomato, onion and lettuce. Their fries are pretty basic but good. The drinks are a self serve soda fountain. The staff was decently friendly, the restaurant was pretty clean and the atmosphere was inviting. The reason for the 3 stars is we were supposed to get the mixed fries of regular and sweet but we only got regular. Also I do feel it's a bit pricey. We go two sandwiches, one drink and one fry and it was nearly $17. Maybe if that total came with both drinks and two fries it wouldn't seem as bad. Overall though it was really good and we'd try them again."}
{"text":"Arrived in Las Vegas and found this little spot during a Walmart run. Used my groupon to feed 5 people including my 2 boys with life threatening food allergies. The chef came court and verified the menu offering to accommodate the meals. We will be here for a few days and they are already asking to come back. The food was very tasty and the service was outstanding!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, always go to the ones in Salt Lake, glad they are in vegas now. my 1st trip there was great !"}
{"text":"Ate here twice now. So good. Firt time my babe had the kahuna burger with pineapple and i had the orange chixken bowl. Very happy!! Get the full bowl its only a dollar more for twice as much! Second time i got a chicken club sandwich the bacon was the best ive had. My babe had the fish tacos and saix the pineapple salsa on them was great. They have lots to pick from eeven deserts. Had some mango ice tea which was amazing. Great location by the school easy parking. Will be back"}
{"text":"Volcano Blackened Mahi! As said in my earlier review, i'm CRAZY for the Mahi. Four stars, went to 5 today, when I realized I could order the entr√©e with steamed vegetables, instead of Rumbi rice.  The Rumbi rice is AMAZING, don't get me wrong, but HOLY CARBS. I believe I could live off of this for the rest of my life, and be a very happy man! :)"}
{"text":"Great little spot close to UNLV.  The menu is pretty basic and prices are great for any budget.  I had the Kahuna Burger with sweet potato fries.... YUM.  Very fresh and lite.  I would definately go back for more."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT! We finally tried this place after a long afternoon of apartment hunting. Got the fish tacos, a steak bowl with Jamaican Jerk seasoning and coconut rice, and a kalua pork sandwich.  Everything was super good.  Portions were perfect.  The staff was super friendly.  A very large order was placed before we got there and our order came a little late and the gentlemen working went out of their way to apologize.  We really appreciated that. Highly recommend this place.  Kids eat FREE on Saturdays and Sundays all day. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Rumbi's is a pretty yummy place.  They only have a couple vegetarian options (rice/noodle bowls with veggies and tofu) but it's good eats.  I also highly reccommend their chips with mango salsa, and their fresh-brewed mango iced tea."}
{"text":"I frequently walked past Rumbi and wondered if they're any good ... and today I skipped Cafe Rio to find out.  I was immediately impressed with the decor inside, since nothing turns me off faster than a white-wall \"insert restaurant here\" sterile box.  So their franchise attention to paint, trim, decorations, quality signs and graphics was welcoming.  The cashier was friendly and I ordered food to go, which arrived in reasonable time on a Saturday afternoon.  The Voodoo Salad with chicken was a decent portion for $8, the tortilla strips were still crunchy when we got home, and I'm glad it had lots of feta cheese.  The sauce was sweeter and spicier than I expected.  The Teriyaki Chicken Kids Bowl was fantastic, and I'm going to recommend it for my gastric bypass friends.  $4 gets you a half cup of grilled chicken, a cup of steamed veg, and ton of white rice (but I adore rice, so I was in heaven.)  I like when the broccoli keeps some crunch, plus they added some celery.  The zucchini and carrots were soft steamed.  :-P  The sauce was super sweet and salty, so thumbs up.  My go-to place is usually Teriyaki Madness, but I'm glad to have found something similar close to home.  This place seems lighter, and they gave me a $3 coupon and punch card, which I'm a total sucker for (way to cinch that fifth star, guys!)  My only suggestion would be the smell in there.  It was ... buttery?  Oily?  Not something I'd want to order, and enough to notice.  Perhaps it was the cakes, which sorely tempted me from their gooey pineapple upside down cupcake signs.  Next time!"}
{"text":"They finally added my favorite item to the menu. The pineapple coconut curry bowl was a \"special\" item and they got rid of it for a few weeks and brought it right back on the main menu. It is delicious. Very good. The orange bowl with noodles is also very good. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries as well. The people working here are always friends. Can't wait till the weather cools down to sit out on the patio. Portions on everything are large and well worth the price."}
{"text":"Ok, do not get the \"fire chicken\" unless you like plain grilled (bland) chicken.  Do get the pork or the grilled sirloin if you want an amazing flavor experience.  I tried half sirloin and half pork over noodles and it was amazing.  I really am starting to love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has tasty food, good prices, great friendly service !!! Check it out for sure, I am pretty picky about food... This place is a hidden Gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been to this place so many times and haven't reviewed it yet. This is great spot to hit up if you have people with a lot of different preferences. There's everything from burgers to bowls, rice and noodles, veggies and meat plates.   First of all, this is NOT, I REPEAT, NOT a Hawaiian BBQ joint. As someone mentioned earlier, it's a cross between Island Burger and Pei Wei. I REALLLLLLY enjoy the Rumbi Beach Burger (two patties, greens, tomato, red onion & thousand island dressing)  and it comes with fries, chips & salsa or SWEET POTATO FRIES! Let me just say, YOU NEEEEEEEEED TO GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES! Of all the restaurants I've been to that have offered such delectable treats, this place offers the best ones by far. You can also get half regular and half sweet potato fries.   I haven't tried the rice or pasta bowls, but they look pretty big and the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"I am a kama'ina and I do miss Hawaii....  I always order the Mahi-mahi entr√©e. It's the best in town. The Mahi tacos are excellent. Portions served are big.   My kid loves the Kahuna burger. She says it's the best burger she has ever had!"}
{"text":"Having never tried this place, I ate here last night with my boyfriend & we both got the rice bowls with fire grilled chicken. I choose the Jamaican Jerk sauce which was fabulous & my boyfriend had the Hawaiian Teriyaki.   We were both pleasantly surprised when our meals came out. The portions were generous & the food tasted very fresh. It was a little pricey, however, for quick service food as for one regular bowl & one large bowl the total came to about $20- and this was without drinks or appetizers/add ons.   One plus was the service. We came in rather close to closing on a weekday night & sat for a while. Working in the service industry I know how it is wanting to close but there are still customers sitting, & the staff continued to be friendly. One girl even offered for us to fill up our to-go waters before locking up. We will be back again!   ."}
{"text":"Kids Teriyaki bowl w rice is where it's at!!! Also Rumbi fries! So good! My favorite place to eat and so inexpensive! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is so good and the atmosphere makes it even more enjoyable :)"}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato fries and burgers here like literally. The staff here is really nice and swift. I love how they give you a stamp card and a 3 dollars off coupon especially if you want to save big time. I recommend eating here during your break at work or school. Shoot I know I will because I can't get enough of those sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"There's only so much grease and cheese and sodium and meat derived from rat ass that I can handle. Once in awhile, I need  a workday lunch that doesn't feel like I pulled the pin of a grenade and swallowed it.   Rumbi Island Grill gives me some veggies that weren't boiled into oblivion, a bit of chicken and some spicy sauces. My usual choice there is a small jerk chicken bowl with Rumbi rice. I sprinkle this with generous squirt of The Hot Cock (aka Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce).   The chicken tastes real. And there's nothing wrong with some rice and beans. Plus I don't wind up feeling like that guy from \"Supersize Me.\" Or worse yet, Jerrod!  I still wouldn't mind a moratorium on steel drum music, though..."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Haven't gone in a while, but we used to go all the time when I would go to school near there. As soon as you walk in, you walk to the counter and you order your food, then you can pick your seating. They're very clean, I've never seen food leftover, or any of the tables a mess. They cook your food quickly, and let me tell you, their food is great! We've bought about 4 or 5 different things from their menu and we loved them all! I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for a good burger that's fairly cheap!"}
{"text":"Ok, I used to love rumbis and always frequented this location but on my most recent visit, I left wondering what the heck happened.. new management? Upcharges if you want grilled chicken for the bowls (now they serve it with shredded chicken instead), watered down sauces, increased prices, bland beyond belief. Will not be back, sadly."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new to try and I picked Rumbi not knowing what to expect. This is a great find! It's very nice inside with upscale tropical decor. It's not a sit down and be served restaurant but still very nice. You order at a walk up counter and then sit down and they bring your food to you. Due to this I left a small tip mainly because it was so good and the boys working were very nice.  I ordered a rice bowl and you get to pick your meat and sauce and it came with lots of veggies. Bowls come in 2 sizes but the small one was more than enough! Food quality was excellent too! I will definitely go back and skip the Panda or Pei Wei and this was much better! My son had shrimp and said it was the best he'd ever had. I had spicy teriyaki chicken and was not too spicy but just right. Try it and you will like it!"}
{"text":"Always quick. Great food, great island music. The staff are welcoming and always smiling. Each time I come, I order something different. That is so not like me, everywhere else I order the same thing every time. See you soon Rumbi"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Everything's very clean and organized. I tried the teriyaki bowl and Rambo fries. They were fantastic!! Definitely coming back again to try something else."}
{"text":"I love the volcano blackened mahi mahi and the salads are great! And I love the ambiance - it's like being on an island in the desert!!  The food is so so good, but there's one huge problem -  I end up with bad stomach issues every time I eat here - regardless of what I order (on separate occasions: fried shrimp, pineapple burger, volcano plate, salad, fries, chicken bowl)....and I have *zero* food allergies and eat out a lot without issues.  I would eat there all the time if there was some guarantee that I wouldn't be doubled over afterward."}
{"text":"Here we have an Island themed restaurant in the vein of Tokyo Joe's and others.  I tried a pulled pork sandwich with \"rumbi fries\" which are regular pencil fries mixed with crinkle cut sweet potato fries.  The pork was pretty good, could have been less dry.  It had a slight smoky flavor.  The fries were good although I could do without the coating on the sweet potato fries (or any fries as far as that goes).  The meal was served with a nice BBQ sauce and ala Salt Lake City, fry sauce.  Eat outside and enjoy the resident sparrows which emit impertinent chirps if you toss them a crumb and then nothing else for a few minutes.  I had no idea a bird not much bigger than a ketchup packet could be reduced to begging and groveling for tidbits of my dinner."}
{"text":"Decent place. Nice and clean. Food is ok. Had a pulled pork sandwich. Whatever liquid was on it soaked through the bread making it really soggy. I don't like my bread having the consistency of being in water all day. I will try them again a second time to see if anything else is worth having. Conclusion, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Very good, as i have stated before I don't eat meat, they have BROWN rice, veggies, and ORGANIC tofu, service wAs friendly and made a good recommendation, I'm glad to see there is a place across the street from my work where I can get se vegetation and not have to feel guilty about eating it, very good and I'm very impressed, will be returning again!"}
{"text":"The Rumbi Island Grill restaurant is no longer open at the 4280 E Indian School Rd location."}
{"text":"cousins brought me here. The sweet potato fries are ok not a fan of the place its a chain so things feel to corporate. The workers here felt like they were about to die and the sight of us made them smile for help. The food wasnt that good and over priced. The island feel... i dont get it, which islands? Caribbean or Pacific? its cool to play bob marley but make up your mind on the items."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The balsamic dressing I could drink with a straw. I get the chicken And shrimp entree. My husband loves the mahi. We don't look at each other the entire time. In fact I'm here and taking a break to write this because I need this place to be successful. These doors must stay open or I will die!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. They had great bowls with lots to pick from.  I had teriyaki chicken with noodles and my wife had Bali island pork with brown rice.  The food was great and they even had mac and cheese for our little one.  Kids eat free all summer, you cant beat that.  We are looking forward to our next visit :)"}
{"text":"Rumbi's is just bombtastic!! Gives you that island feel as soon as you walk in.  The music and island visuals make you feel like you're in Hawaii. I frequent with Rumbi's not only because it's adjacent to my job but their food is very flavorful and the employees are always down to earth and happy.  Blackened salmon, Rumbi burger with the pineapple, steak and shrimp salad,the Rumbi rice!! Sweet potato fries.. omg I can't stop.. I never have been dissapointed with any food item and this will always be a local favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. The blackened salmon with Rumbi rice is fantastic. The wife had the blackened Mahi with Rumbi rice which she really enjoyed. The tempura appetizer was pretty good too. The customer service was pleasant, they were attentive, polite and very helpful with our 3 children. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The Jamaican Jerk chicken brown rice bowl has fantastic flavors. The chicken was a little on the rubbery side but the flavors were terrific! I will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is so good that I was working on this side of town for the past week and a half and I literally ate here every single day for lunch. Even came back after my shift a couple of times to pick up dinner lol. Each day I tried something different and not one meal failed me. The girl that took my orders really took care of me as well, she gave 110% customer service."}
{"text":"This place was great!! I had the cabo tacos and my hubby had the volcano blackened mahi. He isnt a fish eater but LOVED it. Thw tacos were great. My 5 year old had the chicken dippers. We also had rumba fries. Service was great. This place was a great find."}
{"text":"What can I say but...all good, every time! This is my default lunch location because I know I will enjoy whatever dish I choose. Island Mac, Sweet Potato Fries, Salmon, Fish Tacos, Spinach Salad are all delicious. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"I loved the set up of this small restaurant and like the fact that it's right across the street from UNLV.  I came here for a lunch as part of a fundraiser for a student organization. I ended up ordering a tofu spicy teriyaki bowl ($7.95) that came with white rice and veggies and a fountain drink (total $11 +change). The customer service was impressive at first - the cashier was abnormally friendly and the guy who brought me my food grabbed me a fork. Even though the cashier tried to up-sell me into buying pineapple cake for dessert, I still liked the guy.   It wasn't until I sat down and realized I had been duped! When asked for a drink, I replied with a simple yes. The cashier had automatically given me a large drink, so he up sold me there (though without my knowing consent). I hate when restaurants do this because I feel it's almost unethical. Ask me what size I want damn it! Or else I'll just assume you're giving me the regular size. I was peeved about that but didn't bother saying anything because I figured hey, the money is going towards a fundraiser. Remember to specify exactly what you want if you go to Rumbi's.  Now for the food: it was just okay. The veggies were overcooked, i.e, the broccoli had lost all its green color and was squishy to the max. The \"spicy\" factor I asked for was seriously lacking. Last, the rice was hard and crunchy, NOT soft and fluffy.   I probably won't come back to Rumbi's. :/ The restaurant has a 4 star rating, but I just didn't get that level of experience. I'm only giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 because I'm grateful they have a tofu dish and an employee saved me the trip of getting a fork."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing special. Some of the chicken is undercooked. Some is dry. I'm unlikely to return unless they improve their recipes. I did receive good service at the counter, but the food was not good."}
{"text":"Usually love this place. Today I placed my order and it arrived at my table wrong. I politely asked that they fix it so they took it back to the kitchen, removed the mistake by hand, stirred the plate around a little bit and brought it back to me. I'm sorry that YOUR mistake could cut into your margins but that's not my fault. Next time if YOU screw up, please properly fix YOUR mistake!  P.s. $10 for a teriyaki bowl is too pricey!"}
{"text":"A favorite of ours for family dining.  Rumbi Island Grill has a tasty menu, and reasonable prices.  The service sometimes seems to be hit or miss, but overall it's pretty good.  We frequent this place when we are dining with our three kids as there is always something for everyone.  Mac & Cheese for the youngest, cheese burgers for the teen, and tasty bowls and salads for parents.  Can't beat the music playlist, always some good roots reggae playing!"}
{"text":"We love the yummy Sweet Potatoe fries (you can ask for the Rumbi fries to be Sweet only).  My husband loves the Luau plate.  I usually get a chicken bowl and the large is so big I share with my youngest daughter.  My daughter with Celiacs Disease gets a rice bowl with naked vegetables and chicken.  They now have a gluten free sauce (yeah)!  The service is good, you order at the front counter and then they bring you the food.  The last time to food took a little longer then usual and they gave us a coupon for free meal with out asking."}
{"text":"It's kind of a fast food place minus the drive through. So if you're expecting something fancy or first date worthy, you're doing it wrong.   That said, it's very good food for not a lot of money. I always order the half bowl and it's more than enough. I usually have some leftover. The chicken is good and free of any foreign substances and is all white meat. The rice is always perfectly cooked and they don't pour a gallon of sauce on everything. The veggies are also done without being cooked into mush. The people who work there are friendly and helpful and I have gone there many times. Check it out if you want something different than the normal fast food ware."}
{"text":"The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here."}
{"text":"I got their Hawaiian pulled pork special that comes with rice and mac salad.  The pork and the rice were both perfections!  The mac salad was what mac salad always is.  For dessert I got the pineapple upside down cake which was a religious experience.  The staff was very helpful and friendly and our food was brought out quickly."}
{"text":"First time experiencing Rumbi Island Grill and I give it a thumbs up! My boyfriend and I had the Calypso Spinach Salad (mine with grilled shrimp and his with beef sirloin)- YUM!  I ordered dressing on the side and ended up not needing it. The flavors from the grilled shrimp mixed in perfectly.  Great menu, staff and pricing!  Looking forward to trying out other items!"}
{"text":"This is a cool, somewhat novelty addition to the usual UNLV eatery rounds (Chiptole, Cafe Rio, Cugino's etc) when I forget to pack my lunch lol. This place is especially helpful for vegetarian options, and I've had the rice bowl with tofu in Jamaican Jerk twice now and though it tasted more like teriyaki sauce and was not the least bit spicy....I still thought it was reasonably good! Another plus is that they have brown rice too    Also as of late, the staff been so generous with their $3 off coupons. The first time I came, they gave me two :-)   The only downside was that I felt like there was just so much rice compared to protein and veggies, which somehow made the Filipino in me feel just a teensy bit gypped! Nevertheless, I will probably be back and see how other options on their menu fare"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times and have never been let down. Never too busy. Not too expensive. The portions are large. I always get a rice bowl, with brown rice. No matter what sauce I get it's always tasty. The music it always an island mix which goes with the theme and has a nice calming effect. The service here is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I just had my first veggie burger today and it was delicious!   Thank you for having cruelty free options!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place.  We have a 9 year old who hasn't yet developed an adventurous palate, but he loves the burger and the chicken strips, so we can take him there and be free to enjoy some of their interesting and unusual sandwiches and  fantastic salads (although they recently took our favorite off the menu).    The music is great too, really sets an \"island\" vibe.  But what really sets this place apart is the staff.    Rumbi has done a great job of hiring upbeat, friendly, helpful, cheerful staff who remain that way at all times.  You'll likely just feel good about being here, there are a variety of relatively healthy menu items, and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Ask why I haven't done a review? I thought I had a long time ago, but anyways - been coming here for years with my family. Kids eat free on Mondays & Tuesdays after 4pm is a plus since I have a couple of kids 12 & under. The ambiance is relaxing with its island theme, and the staff is so nice and we've never had a problem in the years we've been coming with them or with the food! Another plus is that it's casual dining, but to me, not fast food so that's awesome! So the food: My go to salad always, always, always is the Calypso Salad. Delicious chicken pieces, fresh spinach & mandarin orange slices, red onions, walnuts, crumbled cheese (feta?) with the drizzle of an amazing dressing. Very filling & costs about $8. The kids go with either the mini burger or cheeseburger, or the honey orange chicken with rice & what I recently found out was that you can get the option of a bigger order for adults in either a half bowl or full one. So my soon to be 13yr old daughter will most likely go with that! My older boys (16 & 19) never get anything but the scintillating Kahuna burger that's topped with a pineapple slice & teriyaki sauce served with fries, the Beach burger, or the outrageously tasty Cabo tacos with your choice of protein & side dish (white, brown or Rumbi rice). The hubs usually orders a full rice bowl with perfectly cooked veggies and really, it changes each time we visit regarding both the protein & sauce, so let's just say he loves every one of the bowls!! Lvastly I want to mention even yummier things like the Rumbi fries. Hello? A crispy, non-greasy, flavorful basket of both regular fries & crinkly cut sweet potato fries. OMG with the Rumbi sauce... I've got to have this each time I visit & I snack on these with my salad. I should branch out of my comfort zone & try other things, but I'm spoiled at the delicious items I already order each time!"}
{"text":"There's a little bit of an island vibe going on right here in Arizona.  This casual place makes me smile.  Yes, it's just a step above a fast food place, but the vibe is tropical and the food is tasty and prepared fresh to order.   When you walk in, you'll notice the island music playing, the ceiling fans turning and some kitschy Hawaiian posters on the wall.  The air is filled with aromas of teriyaki, Jamaican jerk, island spice rubs.  Take a look at the menu on the wall and then approach the counter to place your order.  You pay and they give you one of those big plastic numbers to place on your table so the food server can match you to your order.  While waiting (not long) you help yourself to the beverage station, sodas, water, and the specially prepared Mango Iced Tea, which is amazing.  I just can't get enough of that Mango Iced Tea.  Looking around, it seems that most customers order the rice bowls.  You choose a meat (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.) then pick a sauce flavor (teriyaki, Jamaican Jerk, Bali Island, Honey-orange), and then your choice of rice (white, brown, noodles).   Looks really good.  I typically order one of their big entr√©e salads.  I alternate between their Voodoo Chicken Salad and their Aloha Chicken Salad. I can't decide which one I like better.  My husband loves their Volcano-Blackened Mahi Mahi plate.  Where else can you get perfectly spiced Mahi topped with tropical fruit salsa, rice, and a salad for under $ 10?  Yum, tasty and a great value.  It's just a simple little place, but every time I eat here, it reminds me how much I love Hawaii and hope to return someday.  Until then...Aloha."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. The kids meals are very good as well. The noodles with the coconut flavor were amazing!!  The portions are generous as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic I went with my boyfriend and he's obsessed it's so cute inside and the food teriyaki is amazing (he's a teriyaki chicken fanatic so that's saying a lot from him) will be returning"}
{"text":"Friendy, clean, food is really good."}
{"text":"First visit here. The staff was really nice. The food was ok. I ordered luau pork n grilled chicken bowl. First thing I noticed was the huge portion of rice. The pork was really soft and the chicken was very tender. Ill most likely return."}
{"text":"I'm with Ada G. on this one.  I've had some different things from here and every time I get a stomach ache too.  Now don't get me wrong, it always tastes great, it just doesn't feel good afterwards.  I can't figure it out..."}
{"text":"With regard to rice bowls, this place is better than average.  I had the Jamaican Jerk Cicken & Steak today.  Pretty good other than a piece of steak was unchewable."}
{"text":"Great place when we want something quicker and don't want a sit down place.  Be sure to get the Rumbi burger and make sure you get extra teriyaki sauce on the side. You're gonna want that teriyaki sauce. :)"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. We couldn't decide if we wanted to go to chipotle, cappriottis, or 5 guys. My husband was making me decide so I said fine we are going to Rumbi. He told me he would choke me out if it wasn't good since we were going off the reservation. It turned out to be really really good so no one call the cops. I ordered the cabo fish tacos and he had the Jamaican jerk chicken bowl. We both had the Rumbi rice which has coconut flavor and some beans in it. We also had chips and mango salsa. The mango salsa was on the fish tacos as well. It was all so so good. We will definitely be back. Oh, when you get your drink, there is a button on the machine where you can put vanilla and cherry flavoring in your soda. The place itself has tropical island decor and that's what I wanted it to have. Also seemed to be clean too. Neither of us could eat all our food but they have to-go boxes at the counter. Found a new place to love."}
{"text":"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).    The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received."}
{"text":"I should've written this update while back but something called life...After my initial review, the owner contacted me right away and apologized for the bad experience. I have to be honest, but the bad service I received from the employee who is no longer there anymore ruined the whole experience and I really didn't care what the food tasted like. I just wanted to eat and leave! Anyhow, I haven't been back yet but the apology and follow-up concerns I received were really genuine so I'm planning on going back soon. It's just kinda far for me but I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Typical Utah food. No flavor. Not even salt on the fries or tortilla chips. No seasoning on hamburger."}
{"text":"I ordered the blackened salmon with Rumbi rice and sweet potato fries.  It was yummy!  My husband and kids liked their food too.  The staff was incredibly nice and I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Aloha mango salad amazing great and frendly people very clean. Great customer service sweet potato fries are amazing love there mango ice tea love rumbi great place everybody should come in this place"}
{"text":"My bf and I were in the area and looking for a place to eat on Friday night. We weren't sure what to eat so of course we had to pull up Yelp and of course Yelp saves the day because this place was amazing!   I've never heard of it and neither one of us has ever had Caribbean food before so we wanted to try something new and I'm so glad we did!   He ordered the Rumbi beach burger combination which comes with fries and a drink while I ordered the Island Chicken Jerk sandwich. We always try to order different things at new restaurants so we can both experience something new and see what we like. We're both actually kind of competitive because we like seeing who ordered the better dish lol. And in this case apparently HE won! His burger was so amazingly mouth watering! He said he almost didn't even want to give me his half of it! haha. My sandwich was also good but not as good as his.   Everything was so good at this restaurant. Even the fries and the special sauce that came with it was amazing! Not to mention the price is SOOOOO reasonable. I think the only negative thing I have to say is I wish the location was easier to find. We had to drive around for a while to find it, but it was definitely worth it in the end. =)  The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I'm so glad we found this place on yelp because I will DEFINITELY be coming back. All this talk is making me want to ditch work and go get one right now! Trust me folks, you won't be disappointed. =)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is delicious and kids eat free Saturday and Sunday. Can't beat that. Food is so good...can't emphasize that point enough."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Wasn't sure about Hawaiian food it was tasty . The service was good. You order first and it's served to your table.  I will try it on another occasion. The restaurant was clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday. Not too busy. This is where you order then sit down while they make your order and bring it out to you. There is a  definitely Hawaiian theme going on here. From the surfing and beach pictures to the Hawaiian and Calypso music in the background.   I ordered the Luau Pork Plate with Rumbi rice and creamy macaroni salad. My order was up in a reasonable amount of time. I must say the pulled pork was exactly like I remember it in Hawaii when I was there. I wasn't a big fan of it there and I'm not a big fan of it here. Not that it was bad It just wasn't as good as other places. The BBQ sauce was ok and seriously needed on the tasteless pork. What made the dish was the Rumbi Rice the pork was place on. It was excellent. Seasoned rice with red beans perfectly cooked. I might come back just to order the Rumbi Rice. The macaroni salad was average. something like the stuff you'd get at the grocery store deli. The  dish also came with a side of Asian slaw. It had no dressing of any kind on it. I actually used some of my wife's dressing from her order to flavor it a little bit. This place is ok, the price is reasonable, but not worth going out of my way for."}
{"text":"This is good eats. So far Im hooked on the Pulled pork anything. The Kahuna Burger will put you down to bed. You will get the Itis. The staff are friendly and fairly accommodating. I have been here twice and haven't really had to wait. I havn't oredered anything low calorie either. Ill be back to try the rice bowls and their salads soon. So far four stars."}
{"text":"Food tastes fresh and the sweet potato fries are sooooo good! Tempura shrimp is really good too and the price not bad at all."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick, healthy bite to eat. I found this place through a 2-for-1 coupon and could not be more pleased. I highly recommend the fire-grilled chicken teriyaki bowl. Very tasty and I love the veggies that come with...my only complaint is that I swear I have gotten a few frozen veggies in my mix before. It's so hard to say for sure since the portions are so big that my food get cold before I can finish it anyway. Overall...very good, fair prices, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place a long time ago. My first taste was during the Hawaiian festival at springs preserve. I waited anxiously for them to finally open up here.  Their Rumbi Rice is a nice change from regular rice because they infuse it with coconut.  Today, I actually tried the Rumbi BBQ Salad. I think I found my new favourite go to salad, it was that amazing! It's located in a pretty busy area but the service is always fast and friendly.  I'll definitely keep back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Food here is great, but service is a bit on the slow side. If you're in a hurry then you might want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Volcano-Blackened Mahi - No words to describe the exquisite flavor of this dish.  Can I just tell you that a Vegetarian actually suggested I try this? Now how good is your meal when you can make an herbivore turn omnivore?   The accompanying Caesar salad is a nice compliment as is the citrus aioli & pineapple salsa...mmm mmmm...my mouth waters just thinking of it. I'm not a big steamed white rice fan (booooooring) but I even manage to eat at least half.  Oh and as if that wasn't reason enough to get the car keys and head out now, they serve the extra yummy Longboard Lager from Hawaii that I so cherish.  The staff are friendly. The decor definitely helps to transport me to a tropical place.  If you love flavorful food, go here. Located just off the 60 on Val Vista just NW of Baseline Rd.  I've been to the Scottsdale one and this one and the flavor is always consistently delicious. I'll force myself to try another meal next time and will modify this review if need be, but for now, they \"gets\" a 5 from me!"}
{"text":"Their tortilla soup is amazing!!! The Caribbean chicken and shrimp plate is also out of this world.  Rarely crowded and one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich and was blown away by how tender, juicy and flavorful it was. Definitely slow roasted. I'm glad I has the sauce on the side because it didn't need any and would have ruined the experience!   Had chips and salsa on the side... Not sure why... They were nothing special.  Good alternative to fast food without being too much more expensive. Sort of a Hawaiian version of Qdoba (in dining experience, not food). No waitstaff."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan because it is like typical fast food restaurant food. I gave it a three star because I like the coconut flavor in the food I had the small veggies rumbia rice bowl"}
{"text":"Stopped by and ordered the Luau Pork rice bowl with teriyaki and the shrimp tempura for $15. It gets two stars because the shrimp was good. But the rest... very unsatisfied. The pork was too salty and over powering and the price was way to much for this."}
{"text":"What do you get when you cross a Pei Wei with an Islands?  You get Rumbi.    Walk up and place your order.  Chose from their big and darn good looking (wish I'd gotten one) salads ($7.49), their rice bowls (Full $7.59/Half $6.59) or one of their grilled sandwiches ($6.69) that include grilled chicken, pulled pork, jerk chicken and a few burgers.  They give you a number.  Sit down and they bring it to you.  We each got  sandwiches and paid the $1.99 extra for a side salad.  I liked my sandwich, but I think that side salad was my favorite part.  A really great dressing and super fresh greens (non-iceberg) were great, but the extra points went for the crumbled cheese and the honey crusted walnuts on top.  WOW!  That was not expected.  While our burger/pork sandwich were fine, I kept finding my self wishing I got a salad when I saw one being brought out.  I think I'll have to do that next time we're in the area because they really looked awesome - and huge!  Might have to split one of those and a bowl of their Bahama Mama Tortilla soup with coconut milk that caught my eye after I'd already ordered.  Mmmmm...."}
{"text":"YUM!!! I found this place when after returning something at Banana Republic. I was sick of going to the the same old places during my lunch break. I ordered the full sized bowl with terakyi chicken and veggies. It was very good. The sauce wss awesome. The prices are ok because for me, this one bowl lasts me 2 meals. The atmosphere just makes me happy. I went in on a rainy day and they were just playing this fun island music. Brought me to a little tropical island on my lunch break. The service is AMAZING. Someone kept walking around and making sure everyone was doing alright. I will be back!"}
{"text":"way to make a great first and last impression. close at 9, we got there 8:45. girl at order register counting her drawe, no acknowledgement. after a few minutes my wife says \"its our first time here\" to which she replied that she was closed. go to the other cashier who finished up with a customer and then immediately said \"ill be right back\". we will not be back. Mahalo"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiin Burger I've had in a long time.  My friend really liked his salad also.  Prices good for the area.  Fast enough for lunch."}
{"text":"The restaurant has open, spacious seating and I was immediately overcome with deja vu.  Then it hit me--this is the islander's version of Chipotle!!!  The only difference between Rumbi & Chipotle (well besides the food!)--is the tableside service.  You get your order/pay for your food and they bring your food to your table.  Interior--There is a huge menu mounted on a waist high podium near the front door and as you walk along the wall to the front counter, there are plenty of opportunities to pick up a paper menu.  The decor incorporates faux bamboo, dried palm leaves strategically draped and many surf/island related motifs.  Food--The menu selection is great.  Not too many items to overwhelm and just enough of the staples to appease most appetites--rice bowls with several protein options (including tofu), sandwiches, soups, salads, and a few island plates.  They even offer a select variety of wines and beer.  One of my new favorites is a Kona Lager you can of course, purchase at Rumbis.  (I bought a 6 pack @ Bevmo a while ago and it's phenomenal!)  I ordered the half size rice bowl with luau pork.  This portion is actually large enough to feed 2 small children or a really hungry adult.  The pork was served with teriyaki sauce on the side, which I discarded because the seasoning on the pork was sufficient.  I appreciated that they offered varieties of rice (including brown & a rumbi version--not sure I recall reading what was in that but it was nice to have options).  They provide a nice serving of mixed veggies to round out the meal.    My experience--I enjoyed the casual atmosphere, the service was speedy, and the food was great for no more than $8.  It's a great place to grab a quick lunch or chat leisurely over a meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the atmosphere was cool and very Caribbean. I ordered the luau pork plate with Rumbi rice and the food came out pretty quick. The portion was big and definitely filled me up. The pork was delicious; super soft and tender, very flavorful! I'd totally get it again. The staff was really nice and the restaurant was pretty clean. I'll definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I dropped in here last week unexpectedly, just had a hankering for something Hawaiian after seeing the movie Aloha. It worked. The food is made to order and the menu is easy to figure out. Make your protein choice, your sauce choice, your rice choice... and voila - it's done. My tofu/veggie with brown rice and teriyaki sauce was cooked well and I found it to be quite tasty. The place was not too crowded just after lunch time so the wait time was minimal. I'd try this place again but it wouldn't replace my regular Hawaiian favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Good place. Not sure I would call it Island food, unless you think anyplace that has water around it is an Island. It is a mix of Hawaiian and Polynesian food. The food was good and the staff friendly. I will try it again now that I now what to expect."}
{"text":"I like Rumbi Island Grill. It's different from Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Pei Wei but in the same genre of food. Order and they serve it. Well, they are different in that what they offer you is to be different than what's out there. And to a lot of degree it is. You like it Hot....try the Jerk Chicken. You like in Island inspired, the pulled pork is just pretty darn good. You like the \"Island Experience\" get it with authentic Macaroni Salad....yes that is really Hawaiian having lived there for 5 years surfing big waves and being a fine artist there.   Sandra said today \" The salads are better than Sauce\"!!!!! That my friends is a giant endorsement coming from a \"hard to please\" person who has been stalking me for 35 years. Where else can you get Mahi Mahi?? It's blackened and very good. What is really neat is you can go Teriyaki or Jerk at the same time. Get noodles or brown rice on all their bowls. Pretty darn good for a change. Try it...you will like it."}
{"text":"I'm a newbie to Rumbi. I'm also a newbie to Phoenix (West Valley). I decided to try out all of the non-fast-food restaurants within a 7-mile radius from my home (shouldn't be that biggie of a challenge).   Rumbi was quite good. I had the MahiMahi over coconut rice with key lime pie. I thought it was pretty over-priced, but good overall. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to say this was a major FAIL for me.  We came around 5:30pm on a Saturday night.  No one was in the restaurant.  There were 2 employees working, one cashier and one \"cook\".  We ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an orange chicken bowl.  Also, the rumba fries.  I had a groupon so I paid 8.00 for 16.00 worth of food.  I had to pay 3 more dollars.  It took FOREVAH!! for the food to be served to me.  The salad was big, tons of lettuce and not that much chicken.  My spouse was served a teriyaki chicken bowl.  I said \" this isn't what I ordered\".  The cook said \" Yes it is\" and  I said \" Nope, its not\".  Spouse said she would just eat it.  After one bite, she says \" taste this chicken\".  I tasted it and it didn't taste like chicken, it tasted like pork.  I brought it back and said that I wanted what I originally ordered.    That took another 10-15 min.  By this point, 6 other customers came in the the \"cook\" was overwhelmed.  Ridiculous.   My spouse got her frozen, reheated chicken nuggets, drizzled with orange sauce and canned mandarin oranges.  She barely touched it and the overcooked fries.  No Thanks Rumbi Grill.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"Ate the Chicken and Steak rice bowl with tempura shrimp. Began vomiting 5 hours after eating there last night. Had to miss work and still feel awful."}
{"text":"I am going to give Rumbi a solid 4 stars.  Here's why...  The staff is amazing.  They are helpful...and they always far exceed our expectations for a casual dining restaurant.  One example?  When an employee with his hands completely full saw DH re-approaching the counter, he set everything down for a moment to get DH's cup.  They are the MOST polite restaurant employees I have encountered in similar restaurants.  They are also on top of everything, making sure the tables are bussed in a short time, even when they are completely busy.  And, to that effect, the tables are spotless when they are cleared.  The food is really quite good.  If DH, DD and I can all eat our food and be satisfied with no complaints, it is a hit.  Honestly, pleasing DD's palate can be challenging at times (with her preferring vegetarian fare).  Rumbi's bowls, while very carb heavy, are filled with delicious vegetables and lightly seasoned proteins.    My favorite is the Bali Island chicken bowl, which feeds me for two days.  I generally order brown rice, which nearly fills the bowl it is in.  Then it is topped with chicken, sauce and vegetables, with a side of the sauce in case you need more (I rarely do).    The sweet potato fries are crinkle cut and served with a dipping sauce.  They are quite good.  Another reviewer gave the fries a thumbs down for them not having salt... well, I have never been served sweet potato fries with salt on them.  Usually I have found them to be served with brown sugar on top, if anything.  The dipping sauce is good and the fries were well-received on my most recent visit by DD.  This is an incredible accomplishment, as she never touches fries!  I've tried the Kahuna Burger.  It did not beat Red Robin's version, but it was VERY filling and, again, made for two full meals.    This place is VERY family-friendly, offering KIDS EAT FREE on Monday and Tuesdays after 4p.m.    I definitely recommend Rumbi for pleasing tricky palates at an affordable price."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here often.  The food is very good, and there is a lot of variety - salads, rice and noodle bowls, burgers and more.   My favorite bowl is the hawaiian teriyaki chicken with noodles.  Most often though I get the kahuna burger with sweet potato fries.  Prices are very reasonable and they have kids eat free nights on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Only complaint I have is that the sweet potato fries are sometimes not very fresh, but when they are, they are very good."}
