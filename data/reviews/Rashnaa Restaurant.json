{"text":"What a disappointment.  The butter chicken was really average.  Nothing special at all, and it would not get me to go back.  The saag paneer was kind of brothy, rather than creamy, which I'm willing to chalk up to a style difference, however it was so salty it was barely edible (and I like salt a lot).

The small veggie side dishes (we had beets, eggplant and lentils) were a highlight and the naan was fantastic.  The chai was delicious but too sweet for my taste.

The main dining room space is nice and casual.  Maybe 10 tables.  There's a good size patio that I imagine is lovely in the summer.  There are two very cute two-person tables upstairs nestled in a dormer window, however I can't imagine sitting up there as you are bombarded with the aggressive, sickly sweet smell of the bathroom air freshener, and one of the seats looks directly at the urinal in the men's washroom (the door seems to be at rest in the open position when the washroom is not in use).

The service was fine and the kitchen was fast.  No complaints at all there.  It was fairly kid-friendly, although they do not have a high chair.  

I've had much, much better Indian food in Toronto.  The Host and Siddhartha both blow this place away.  I probably wouldn't go back, even if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have eaten few Sri Lankan places in NY and NJ and wanted to try this place in Toronto as my friend said they were authentic. We showed up for lunch ( 5 of us) and there wasn't any other soul in this place on a sunday afternoon... always not a good sign.

We settled in and ordered appatizers Somasas, Spicy omlette and vadas. They were all below average, yes the Somosa wer hot so waht they in all places where its freshly made, but no flavour in the filling.

For main course I ordered Veg Kothu Roti and My wife had the String Hopper Kothu roli and the other orders were String hopper meal and the butter chicken.

I asked for extrac spicy and it was below average spice and also bland, very bland its shameful to call it Sri lankan, My wifes was just guey and un palatable that she ate 1)% and discaded it. The string hoppers did not seem fresh, seemed nuked and disn tase fresh.... the 6 curries served with it wasn't good either, the butter chicken I was told was below average.

We didn not bother to even look at the desert menu and decided to grt up and leave quickly.... honestky they do not even deserve a second star, they are a shame to the flavous of an authentic Sri Lankan restaurant.

maybe they were good but they are definitly on the downward slide now!"}
{"text":"Service so bad it gave Faulty Towers a run for it's money.

Oh Rashnaa, once you were a favorite, but you showed me the cold shoulder this evening and I will not darken your door again. I've liked the food here in the past and have supported it as a gay-owned establishment. However after tonight's poor service no more.

I arrived, went in to say hi and then sat on the patio. 

I told them that I was going to order a lot of food and take some away and settled down. I ordered that vadai (tasty), the kothu roti (decent) and the vegetarian delight (decidedly not delightful, items missing, portions small and of scant flavour). I ordered a beer, which came promptly and the evening looked good. The server took an attitude that bringing my food out to the patio was intruding upon his rest and was totally unpleasant. Dishes from my first course (the vadai) were not cleared from the table until the very end. 

The kothu roti was fine, although I have had better elsewhere. The vegetarian delight was a huge heap of rice with three small curries, all of which were peas and potatoes in a thin sauce.

When I ordered a second beer, it arrived, can open, but without a glass. When I asked about this the waiter said \"You don't want a glass do you?\". I responded that yes, I wanted a glass, like I had had with my first. When I asked about the missing achar from the vegetarian delight, he assured me that he had brought everything and brought me the menu to prove his point. It clearly said achar came with the meal. He then told me \"it's not much, just a little pickled vegetables.\". I responded that I knew what it was and that I wanted some, and he grudgingly and resentfully went and got me some. Finally, he asked if I wanted to take the almost untouched vegetarian \"delight\" to go. I said yes, and he brought me a box and an un-asked for (but not unchanrged for plastic bag) while clearing my cutlery. I sat waiting for a spoon for over 10 minutes and finally had to go ask for one. 

When I went to pay I was told cash or debit only, despite signs saying credit cards were accepted.

I'll be investigating the Sri Lankan place around the corner."}
{"text":"The food is great and I love it. It's going to be a constant go-to restaurant when I'm hungry. Veggie biryani combo is great. I haven't had much issue with their food overall. Service could use improvement. Over the phone they are really blunt. Also one time the guy working there purposely put more chilli peppers in my dish when I said I wanted mild that night. look, I dont hate spicy food, it just destroys my colon before bed and then i cant sleep and im running around and stuff. I dont want it every time. I think he did that cuz Im white (THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME MORE THAN ONCE IN DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS). Service is very fast however. For both delivery and eat-in. & Still high quality."}
{"text":"Loved the food (delivery), try the faluda (dessert drink)."}
{"text":"Good food but prices seemed a bit high for the type of place it is
Seems to be a converted house and the ambiance was not very inviting and generally in rough shape"}
{"text":"Just as the others have written here, this place is a hit or miss, consistency is flakey.

Their Kothu Roti is amazing, but only when they're on point, whoever that cook may be, put him on FULL TIME!!!  or teach the others.

I haven't eaten here in a long time, but I used to eat the Kothu often when I did.

Compared to the place up at Kennedy and Finch, this place, when they're on point, is above and beyond better.  Reflected in price as well, I recall the price being nearly $20 for a plate of Kothu from here."}
{"text":"Started with delicious fresh vegetable samosas with hot sauce. They were still steaming from being cooked, spiced well, and not understuffed. 

Rashnaa's Vermiccili has loads of chicken and some vegetables with the pasta. The sauce starts off with a nice warmth but the spice definitely builds as you eat it. The noodles were well cooked, and well coated with sauce.

As someone who hasn't had an Indian meal they've ever loved, Rhashnaa has done a good job of opening my eyes.

I arrived just before the dinner rush, and even once the dining room started to fill up service was still quick. I was seated right away, and there were very short waits between apps and entrees."}
{"text":"Good lord, this place has only gotten better over the years. They've recently redone their menu to include Onion Thosai, which was unbelievably good: crisp lentil shell, stuffed with soft but crispy caramelized onions. Masala Thosai (lentil shell stuffed with potato), was also fantastic. Eggplant and mutton curries were delicious as always -- go for the Rashnaa combo, which gets you both curries and some rice.

And always get a few Roti for the table: buttery and crispy, their layers tear apart beautifully."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I have been to many indian restaurants in US and Canada, this was by far the most authentic Indian/Sri Lankan taste I've had. I ordered the shrimp and it was delicious. Generous amount of food, we couldn't even finish it, low cost. Tiny little place but totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"After moving from New York, I was pretty disappointed with Toronto's delivery options; then I found Rashnaa and things improved. It's a dependable choice for \"lazy\" nights. Most of the entrees travel well, which is good because Rashnaa is rarely quick (I'm near the Skydome and it takes 45-60 minutes). My favorite entrees are the mutton curry and butter chicken. The appetizers are less reliable, probably because most of them are fried. Sometimes the beef pancake is OK. Can't speak about the dine-in experience, but it's a keeper for delivery."}
{"text":"I've been walking past Rashnaa for years on my way to Wellesley or Riverdale park with my dog and always wanted to try it out. I figure if a place hidden off the main street almost in a pack of houses manages to stay in business it must be good. I was right.

I ordered the Kothu Rotty, which is basically a pile of chopped naan (rotty), onions, chilis, eggs, and your choice of meat (post sautee). Absolutely delicious - it will be hard not to order again next time I go, but I would love to try the other Sri Lankan specialties.

My date had the butter chicken. It wasn't her favourite in the city, but it doesn't seem like their speciality.

Service was a little gruff and the inside of the restaurant could use a makeover, but maybe that just adds to the charm (and great prices) of the place.

Recommended."}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to this restaurant.  I am so glad he did.  My husband and I have been there a few times and the food is always excellent.  We've taken friends there who have also been very happy with the food and prices."}
{"text":"I ordered deliver last night and got the combo with chicken curry.  It took me 20mins to sift through the sauce and pick out over 20 little pieces of shards of chicken bones and cartilage. The eggplant that came with it was so mushy and almost cold that i didn't eat it. The other side was a yellow paste that was over salted. The samosa were good (but hard to screw up really!) thank god because it was the only thing i was able to eat in the order"}
{"text":"Worst restaruant ever.
ok, not worst, but so below average

Kothu- which was ok as my friend said it was not the best Kothu he had. 
Dosa - Dosa was so bad we couldn't eat it..
Chilli Chicken - First time dish came out where onion and chicken was burnt, server took the dish back after our complaint and get us another dish which was over spicy ( We said spicy but not something which you cant even eat), I am Indian by ethnicity so i know i can handle spicy food but it was uneatable and i know how chilly chicken should taste like too.

our server bring rice as complimentary as our bread got cold when they were making the dish again, which is good but he said i just bring you rice may be you want to have. which is worst thing i ever heard to give anything as complimentary for your mistake.

Also, the server didn't refill water and have to go to window to wave to get some water after waiting for a while. 

I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and i don't think food was fresh even as i had stomach issues next day. 

Its not worth the price and its not that cheap as its standard rate for many downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"Small Sri Lankan/Indian takeout place.

The only food I remember was the string hopper kothu- appealing and interesting. Basically rice noodle chopped and fried, almost like rice. The curries etc. are average. Have not tried the roties or dosa.

The service is like someone said is slightly gruff, but ok and they do throw in a free dip each time. Prices are decent; could be spicier. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Tasty food, lousy service.

Went to Rashnaa in a party of 4, first visit for all of us. The papadums that we shared as an appetizer were fine, though entirely unremarkable; the mango lassi was very tasty and made a wonderful smooth, creamy counterpoint to the spicy food. I ordered the \"chicken devil\", a side of rice, and the cucumber-tomato raita.  The chicken devil was well-balanced, with plenty of heat and a smoky charcoal-grilled flavour, and the serving size was generous (the rice was easily big enough to split two ways). The raita was nice and fresh and cool, if maybe a little watery.

But the service!  Oh, the service.
The one waiter was taciturn verging on surly, and I'm not sure he spoke a single word while we were there, preferring to just grunt when addressed. He had the air-conditioning cranked so that it was about 8 Celcius in the restaurant while we were all dressed for a hot August evening.  Asking him to turn it down got a vaguely affirmative-sounding grunt but no actual effect. We had to ask twice to get water. When we asked for the leftovers packed up to take home, he unceremoniously dumped a styrofoam container and plastic bag on the table and walked away. Finally, when we asked for three cheques (one couple & two singles), he just split it into two instead.  All in all it was the kind of service where you wonder if a 5% tip is too generous.

Also, the location is in a distinctly seedy neighborhood, and the decor of the restaurant can be summed up as \"hastily converted from a run-down little house\"

As a take-out joint, it might well be worthwhile, but as a restaurant to actually sit in and eat... not so much."}
{"text":"Good Restaurant. My family ordered a Masala Dosa, String Hopper Thali, and one other veggie combo. Masala Dosa was good besides the potato Masala being bland. Curries that came with thali and combo were decent, except the eggplant curry. Food had a homemade like feel. A bit different from the type of South Indian food I'm used to eating, because this is actually not even Indian, but Sri Lankan, which is pretty similar to Keralan cuisine."}
{"text":"Rashnaa used to be one of our favorite Indian restaurants and was at the top of our take-out list, but no more.  After several bad experiences of dinning at the restaurant, we decided to just order take-out, which seems to work better for us.  Maybe the massive amount of take-out orders are to blame for the slow-moving dine-in service?

I love spicy food, so my favorite dish on the menu is Chili Chicken (fried boned chicken with blends of chili, curry leaves and tomato sauce).  This dish is a hit or miss, sometimes it tastes absolutely amazing.  Other times, I think it's something in tomato sauce, perhaps, it was from a can (just saying).  My second favorite is Kothu Rotti with eggs (Rottie cut up and stir fried with eggs and scallions).  When it is not oily and soggy, it's not bad.

Because of its inconsistency, we have decided to place Rashnaa at the bottom of the list, for now.  Maybe one day, we'll give it another try?"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, and delivery was incredibly quick and efficient, the on-line ordering system is very good.  Loved the vegetable biryani and the beef pancake roll.  Definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I love their service and they have the best chicken kottu roti in town! Please give that a try. Parking isn`t hard to find. If anything you can park behind Pizza Pizza and walk for about 3mins. Be sure to give this place a try! You`ll love it!"}
{"text":"If you like SPICY...try the devil chicken! Amazing! Not a lot of atmosphere but great food!!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic, and the lunch specials are unbelievably priced. My husband's favourite is the chicken devil platter, with boneless, spiced chicken with big hunks of peppers and onions. Their rotty is fantastic, tender, flaky, pull-apart, and oh-so moresome. I'm a big fan of the eggplant curry, which accompanies a host of combo plates and the biryani dishes. Their chicken curry is good, with big pieces of bone-in chicken. A word to the wise on the spice ranges - Sri Lankan spicing is a lot hotter than most, so if you're unsure, go a spice range lower (ie: medium instead of hot). If you don't specify, you'll end up with a mouthful of hot - which may or may not be a good thing, depending on tolerance levels. Service can be a little slow at times, but never mindbogglingly so- as its a small place they are quick to respond when being flagged. Highly suggest more people drop in for their weekday lunch specials to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but over priced. Samosas came out somewhat cold. Ordered the butter chicken and it had zero flavor. The chicken itself was very tender but the dish was small and had no flavor. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The SriLankan food was awesome and prices really low. We were the only ones in there for a really late lunch and service was good. The kathrikkai gothsu that is a side dish is simply the best eggplant preparation ever and I generally dislike eggplant!"}
{"text":"As a native Sri Lankan, the food did not assimilate true Sri Lankan cuisine. We ordered the deviled chicken which the chicken should have a bit of crisp to it and have a nice sauce. Instead the chicken was just normally cooked and placed in marinara sauce with a ton on onion slices. Marinara sauce isn't even a Sri Lankan thing. We also ordered the kothu rotti which was nice but lacked vegetables. We ordered spiced coffee and when asked what was the spices they said was made with Sri Lankan spices, all it was was regular ginger coffee. I would not recommend this to be a place to experience Sri Lankan food."}
{"text":"Yeah this place was awesome.  I was out on an excursion on my day off with little else to do besides nurse a hangover, so I decided to go check out a different part of town. The area that Rashnaa is located in has alot of expensive homes full of rich people.  I walked right by at first, but the sharp curry smell struck me..and I was immediately ready to eat and eat alot.

Rashnaa has an outdoor patio. Inside there is a small dining area lightly decorated with some obscure, yet very cool to look at pictures.  The bathrooms are located up on the stuffy second floor, which I found a bit awkward.  After being seated I ordered the string hopper kothu combo with spicy chicken.  I have never to my knowledge ever eaten Sri Lankan food, so I decided to jump with both feet on this one and order the weirdest sounding thing on the menu.

Not long after ordering my meal arrives.  It's smelled soo good.  There was a cylindric mass of egg noodles mixed with some form of vegetables and eggs.  There were crepes, seasoned potatoes, and a cast iron looking bowl with alot of spicy sauce with a single small drumstick of chicken inside it.  It was a small amount of chicken to be completely honest, so I was disappointed in that.  The chicken itself was so soft, it came right off the bone...but that was little consolation in how little chicken I actually got.  

In the end I loved the meal.  The spicy sauce the chicken came in was perfect for dipping the crepe into, and I'll definitely be back to experiment more with their intriguing menu.  The service was fast, however the ambience could use a bit of work.  The tables seemed a bit too close together to the point that I almost felt that I was having dinner with the large family with two babies seated beside me making alot of noise.  They actually fed one of the babies spicy-something which naturally resulted it coughing uncontrollably and gasping for breath.  What were they thinking??  Repeatedly clapping the poor kid's back was hardly helping the situation.... aaannyway...Rishnaa!! Go there!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for some butter chicken. I had takeout and it was absolutely terrible. Their was no spice or flavor I had to add hot sauce too it. 

The chicken was really dry and I felt ripped off. Will NOT be returning. Go to the butter chicken factory across the street instead."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, I had to check it out myself.  I got take-out and it was ready to pick up in 20 minutes.  Vegetable samosas were some of the best I have had in Toronto.  Not too greasy, but not too dry.  I'm not sure if they make them on site, but they are definitely delicious.  

I followed that up with the butter chicken.  Definitely a different taste, but definitely delicious.  The sauce was better than the chicken itself, with hints of cinnamon really making the dish. 

I'll have to go back to make a more complete review, but good all and all."}
{"text":"Last night, I was in flavour country. Incredible, dairy-free flavour country.

My friends have been apparently going to this place for years without inviting me. After dinner, all was forgiven. We ordered the beef roll appetizer, samosas, devil beef, mutton curry and a veggie curry sampler. Everything was DELICIOUS, particularly the beef roll and mutton curry. I was seriously blown away. The service was very friendly (they even gave us a free dish of yellow lentil daal!) and it was just a really nice and comfy place for dinner. It was also pretty busy. We ran into Imran and his friends there, in fact. There were a few young families having dinner (Indian, if that matters) as well as a few couples. 

I'm definitely going back, particularly since they told me that very little of their menu contains dairy. Their delivery zone also ends about 2 blocks away from my house, so I'll definitely try bribing them to deliver to my place next time I have a hankering for Indian/Sri Lankan food and don't want to move."}
{"text":"Thank you for the lady cooking this food. If you like Indian food... this Sri Lankan food blows it out of the water. Flavors are just popping in your mouth. Best vegetable samosas and eggplant i've ever had. The koththu roti is a great base dish for any saucy dish you get. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rashnaa is a restaurant providing Sri-Lankan/South Indian cuisine.  I have to say it is in the rather surprising location of Parliament and Wellesley.

The kothu roti, which takes traditional south indian thin roti (veethu roti) cut up, mixed with spicy gravy, meat and fried egg is pretty decent.  However, I have to say it will never come close to the authentic stuff from Sri Lanka.  Even the roti used is not as good.

Not a fan of their thali's at all.  Please go to a real south indian restaurant like Udupi's on Gerrard.

3 stars.  Half decent SL food and a decent place.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I am Sri Lankan and I'm blessed/cursed with my mother and my sister being amazing Sri Lankan cooks. I've also travelled around the GTA and have eaten at numerous Sri Lankan restaurants in Brampton, Mississauga, Scarborough, Pickering, and Ajax. This is not the best Sri Lankan food and doesn't have the same flavour as the other Sri Lankan restaurants in the GTA. Sri Lankan food is all about the balance of spices and Rashnaa sadly doesn't cut. This place is good if you aren't a Sri Lankan food expert or if you're desperately craving some spicy food. It's a shame since I live so close the restaurant and have yet to find a good Sri Lankan restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this restaurant so I went there for take out.
First of all Service was not good, when i got to eat my food the curry was so tasteless honestly, not spicey or any flavor what so ever.
Wow soooo disapointed about this place.
Will never eat here again, the food of the little shrilankan store on Parliament is soooo much better."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend who never steers me wrong, and he's hit a good one again.

I got takeout - the Masala Thosai, and it was great - really deftly spiced, every bite was terrific. Even though I forgot to ask for medium-spiciness, I didn't find that the hotness of the spices was overpowering.  It was actually just perfect. There was a small bite, but you could taste the complex flavours of the spices overall.  

I'm giving it four stars because I haven't tried much there yet, so I'm not ready to give it five, but so far, so good."}
{"text":"The consistency at Rashnaa is bewildering!  I reluctantly took a friend of mine who lives downtown here because the trek to the legit Lankan places in Scarborough was not an option.  I braced her for disappointment, warning that the food would be nowhere as good as the real stuff.  And then I proceeded to eat my words.  

For some inexplicable reason, on this lazy weekday afternoon, Rashnaa churned out some of the best kothu roti I have eaten in the GTA.  What made it particularly exquisite was the fact that the roti had a slightly crispy texture to it, which just heightened the intense flavors of the dish.  I was pretty incredulous."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, didn't know their own wifi password?, huh, small cozy place, no atmosphere, ie no television, music nothing, but nice food and very reasonable prices, shrimp curry nine bucks?, unheard of, I'd go again,"}
{"text":"RASHNAAAAAAAAAAAA.  

hmm.  it doesnt quite work as well on paper.  or on the internet.   but i love saying their name.   when i know my wife and i are going to order takeout,  from the bottom of my feet, up through my legs, through a belly growling in anticipation, do I belt out like a lion the declaration of battle that is Rashnaa.

a battle of spices and food names that swirl around your tongue like a serpent tempting you in such a way that youll never touch a piece of wonderbread again.  

we have been at the restaurant once before with my niece.  boy was that stupid.  each bite she took was successively more torturous, as she wondered why she was crying when she wasn't the least bit sad.  Yes. Rashnaa can be quite spicy, but not so much so that you cannot taste your food or anything else afterwards.  you might experience a little vibration in your lips, a little fire alight in your mouth, but be sure there are yoghurty delights to temper it all, like the Mix Raita which is cucumber, tomatoes and onions in spiced beaten yogurt.  

Its great to put that on your other dishes (in fact I would, at least if youre doing takeout, order 2 of them) like any of the String Hopper Kotu which is red (roasted) rice flour noodles chopped and sautéed with onion, green peppers, eggs and spices with a choice of mutton, shrimp, beef, chicken, vegetables, eggs, fish, squid or shrimp.  hoowee.  lots of choices.  This dish is rice like in its consistency, very filling, and very tasty with any of the above.  I usually get the squid.

I have also gotten the Vegetable Delight many times.  This is a bunch of different veggie dishes that come with ghee basmati rice with a few different kinds of curry and more.  my favorite in this combination is the cashew and green peas curry.  its so creamy.  

for apps or extra stuff try the egg rotty, the beef pancake roll, seafood cutlet, veggie samosa, or a mixed plate of it all.

If you get a main course dish and all the suggestions I have mentioned, you can have leftovers for the next day and keep it going and going and going..."}
{"text":"We ordered in and what a mistake. The chicken kothu roti smelled great when we opened it that was it. The butter chicken was so dry the sauce was watery and lacked taste, the roti bread tasted like it was made in old oil and the kothu roti was also made with old oil. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Cold atmosphere, terrible service, mediocre food (saag paneer was runny).  I will not be returning.  You can get better food and service at Trimurti on Queen that doubles as a buffet.  This place was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Sri Lankan food, so bear in mind that I have nothing to compare it to. 

I saw a lot of people on Yelp recommending the Kothu Roti. Of the chicken and beef, the server said the chicken was better, so I got that. I expected the roti to be crispy, so I was a bit surprised by its soft texture, but it smelled so good coming out of the kitchen and tasted great. I asked for medium spice, but next time I'd get hot. I also tried Rashnaa's Mango Lassi which was creamy and sweet, but maybe a bit chalky at the bottom. 

I would say the service was average to meh. Someone described the restaurant as a converted house, with a dining area that looks like you're in someone's living room. I got that vibe as well and feel like the decor could definitely be more interesting. I liked the food, so I feel like a more interesting decor/ambience could bring the restaurant to the next level.

On a Wednesday night at around 7-8 pm it was pretty quiet, with one or two other groups eating in and a couple of people picking up take out."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating Sri Lankan food so I really didn't know what to expect. I ordered the vegetarian string hopper thali to go (red rice vermicelli noodles with a few vegetable curries). The food was very flavorful. I liked the coconut curry and the dal very much. The eggplant was good as well. The items were a bit sweet but I liked it. The restaurant itself is tiny and cute and the owner was very friendly to us."}
{"text":"My friend told me to go here. So i did.

All in all, the food was good, well priced, the place was ok. Nothing to rave about but i would go back.

The only complain that i have is the next day experience, but i knew that would be the case going in. There are better places, but i like the fact that this is both an indian and srilankan restaurant two in one. 
It's just more on the srilankan side which means wayyyy more spices in the food and you definitely will be visitng the bathroom more than once the next day."}
{"text":"Delicious! Toronto is the best place for Indian food I've found and Rashnaa doesn't disappoint! The eggplant is especially delicious. It's cooked properly and all the yummy flavours are released into the foods. Eggplant is hard to cook but they do it right. If you get the vegetarian dishes everything is fairly affordable. I can't remember if I've tried the butter chicken, but I like their vegetarian dishes. You have to be choosy about what you order because sometimes it's really good and others it's only so-so depending on what it is. It's been a while since I've ordered but it's delicious last I remember. I'm a repeat customer.

I should add that my experience with them is delivery only."}
{"text":"Came here because I was in the neighbourhood and had read the other reviews on the site.  And I must admit, I was very impressed by the flavour of the food.  I had the butter chicken, which was the tastiest I've ever had and the mutton Sri Lankan specialty.  I also got the appetizer platter.  Along with two naans and a plate of rice, this was enough food for two dinners as well as two left-over lunches (all for $39 before tip).

This was easily the tastiest Indian food I've had yet in Toronto.

I took off one star only because the service was a bit slow, although the waiter apologized profusely for this and mentioned that he had never seen it so busy on a Monday night before."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I was originally introduced to this authentic spot by a Sri-Lankan friend.  It`s not like typical Indian food, as it is not as heavy on the sauces, but instead they get great flavours from nice spices.  Good heat on many of he dishes.  The dosa is a must.  The devil chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"Just like in Sri Lanka.   We had the \"Rice and Curry\" - (a variety of dishes (lentils, tomato, potato, eggplant etc.) with some Kingfish  and Roti. Out of this world.  They also do some South Indian dishes.   Definitely going back (Dosa Dosa Dosa!!!!) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_and_curry"}
{"text":"The Butter Chicken Factory is just down the street, but Rashnaa's does a much better butter chicken. A lovely almondy-tomato sauce, creamy, with soft morsels of chicken. I actually like their butter chicken more than Banjara's, & everyone seems to agree that Banjara does the best butter chicken in Toronto.

Their saag paneer wasn't very impressive - gritty spinach and a few tiny cubes of paneer, in an infuriatingly small \"vegetarian sized\" container. Although I'm not a fan of their titular dish, The Butter Chicken Factory's palak paneer is incredible, so when I do takeaway I get my butter chicken at Rashnaa and my palak paneer at Butter Chicken Factory.

The space is strange. I've never eaten in, but the restaurant is a converted house and the dining room is the original living room of the house. I always feel a little like I'm walking in to someone's place uninvited when I go to pick up my takeaway. They do have a patio for the summer, however.

Staff have always been friendly to me."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Maybe because we have been going here since around 1992 (25+ years).  They are so kind and the food is generous and really enjoyable.  I am not sri lankan or indian but I love the food here.  I highly recommend Rasnaa Restaurant and I hope it is going to be here for another 25 years."}
