{"text":"This is a good traditional restaurant. The food was very flavorful. My only caution is that I wouldn't eat here if you have a dietary restriction. I eat Turkish food pretty regularly without an issue because I ask what I can eat before I order. Unfortunately, the waitress at the Kebab House either didn't understand me or didn't take me seriously. Either way, I got pretty sick. The food was quite tasty though and the restaurant is definitely family friendly. I'm happy to see another middle eastern option in Squirrel Hill even though I probably won't brave it again."}
{"text":"Love the turkish food, add the excellent friendly customer service and this place is high on my restaurant recommendations.  The decor is simple and effective, although others may find it too simple.  However, the food is really, really good and simple. The flavours bring be back to my vacation in Turkey as its quite authentic. Lamb, to chicken to beef, the options allow for single dinner to platters for sharing.  The spicy kebab is REALLY spicy so be careful, the lamb is moist and perfectly grilled, the chicken is tasty and simply seasoned. It all works very well. The size of the the restaurant is not large and accommodate 20 people or so..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Reminds me of the meals I had in Istanbul. The workers are great and really sweet. Best lentil soup I've had in Pittsburgh!! Definitely going to come back!!"}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time with my family, and we were impressed: the service was good and fast, even though the tiny place was almost full, and, most of all, the food was excellent! We ordered the eggplant salad, stuffed grape leaves, lebne and falafel plate for appetizers. These came with flat bread and were very tasty and nicely presented. For mains, we all shared yogurt chicken kebab, shish kebab and chicken kebab, which were absolutely delicious; the shish kebab is definitely the best I have ever tasted, and I don't like lamb all that much, but this meat was out of this world! The main dishes come with a nice size salad and yummy rice, the plates are big, you get a lot of food, the prices are super reasonable for all that you get. We weren't able to finish all the food, so we had leftovers to take home. We were so stuffed that unfortunately we didn't have any room to try the desserts, but that's a must for our next visit. We will definitely come back and would recommend to anyone. They have varied options for both meat lovers and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh salads. As a turkish person recommend kebab house to everybody ..they iskender is my favorite."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is excellent, the portions/service are good, and the prices are inexpensive and it's good for taking a family to. I haven't had much other Turkish food so I can't compare but I can say that it's better than the bamiyam in the same plaza because it's not as crowded, the meat has a much better texture, and it's better to take a family to for a meal.

I'd recommend the chicken and beef shish kebabs. The other type (Adana) which is the flat/long kebab is also great.

The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star review instead of 5 is the lack of variety on the menu. It is new and they said they'd add more stuff but they only have 5-7 entrees atm and very little in terms of sides. We went around 7 and they'd run out of some entrees so we only had a choice of 4 and the people who came after us had to be turned away because they'd run out of meat by around 8 PM so the kitchen was closed early. This probably isn't a problem usually but I'd recommend going before 7:30 on Fri/Saturday and hopefully they can solve it by hiring another chef because only one person was cooking so it was slow with 4-5 other groups there.

Overall, I would give this a 5 star review based on the food but they have to improve their menu and those other small issues that come with new restaurants and it would also help to add some promos in like a lunch special or dinner for a big group of people. If you're going to one of the many restaurants in this plaza though then this is the best option."}
{"text":"Unusually great food and an unusually empty restaurant.  It would be a freaking tragedy if this place went under given how good the food is.  I recommend the spicy version of the sauces which have an intoxicating, addictive quality.  It really is exotic for lack of a less cliched term.

Plus the portions on the combo dish that I got were staggering."}
{"text":"Come for the kebabs.  Good variety and combination platters are served with generous portions and a medley of side dishes.  

They know their seasoning and the spicy kebabs are fantastic...and HOT!  Imported Turkish soda is a treat."}
{"text":"The quality of food is the best. I have tried shish kabab with adena kebab which was realy tasty. Also once tried gyro which I did not like. Still I give five star to this Turkish restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times now. First time I ordered the Adana wrap and cigara borek after being informed they were out of kofte.  Twice they called me up to pickup my order only to tell me it wasnt ready when I got to the counter.  To their credit, the spices in Adana kepab were spot on but it was way too dry. The sauces came on the side which turned quite messy as I had to disassemble and reassemble the wrap. The cigara borek was chewy and the cheese mixture did not taste correct. It wasnt a bad flavor mind you, it just wasnt the right flavor. The second visit, I dined in with a friend and it was more of the same. No kofte so we got Adana wraps. The dine in service was terrible. After dropping off our wraps, the waitress basically disappeared. After a very long wait she finally came back out and asked if we needed anything else, and I asked for our checks. She disappeared again for 20 minutes at which point I went to the counter and asked a cook to get her.

I've tried several times since to give the place a try, every single time I do they do not have kofte, regardless of time or day of week. I find this completely unacceptable, if you dont want to serve it, take it off the menu. 

I'm done with the place. This really would have been a several meals a week location for me but the complete ineptitude of the staff is too much to ignore. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go and have a quick bite to eat. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. We love their falafel and chicken kebab - especially the hot sauce! The hot sauce is amazing..I would definitely recommend this place - it's a gem!"}
{"text":"Bad experience 
it was bad experience because the guy there dont know how to cook because he gave me a raw meat and chicken . I will give them zero star
 :( realy disappointed"}
{"text":"We stopped in just to grab dessert, and I am SO GLAD we did! The honey cake is reminiscent of the best graham crackers, buttery and not overly sweet. The baklava is simply to die for. Can't wait to head back to Pittsburgh and come straight here!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be alright. I ordered the mixed kebab plate and It was good but nothing exceptional. I wanted to try the Iskender dish but they weren't serving it the day I went. I might go again and give it another try."}
{"text":"Best Turkish place in town. Best meat in town. Staff are so nice. Really happy we discovered this gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing doner and chicken was amazing!!! The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. Everything was fresh and good. Five stars and high recommendation. Reminds me of my moms Turkish food back home."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a number of times. We've ordered apps, main courses, and baklava. Have been happy each time, and tend to now crave it on a regular basis. A great place for casual and delicious food."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in GTA. Friendly service but not the fastest. Don't forget to try adanna kebob."}
{"text":"one of the most authentic turkish kebab restaurants you could find in the usa. try the mixed grill and mixed meze!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here because it was open late. I was really surprised at how delicious it was; any meat dish will stand out. I've gone back since and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"We visit this place regularly. It has amazing chicken kebabs and falafel wraps. They are full of flavour. I love their breads as well. Must try place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The cons:
1. Half the orders came while the others were delayed
2. The server was nice but didn't take her time and seemed in a hurry although restaurant was empty
3. Paper plates and plastic utensils 
4. No desserts!
5. Iskender kebab plate is $17 but the portion is small and it shows kebab in picture but it's actually donair

The pros:
1. They seem like nice people
2. Food tastes not bad
3. I was very hungry :)"}
{"text":"Definitely the best kebabs in the town!! Our fav is chicken Adana wrap, delicious. The cooks Bahadir and Faruk are very good chefs, also very very kind people. My husband Matthew and I feel very welcomed every time we visit them; and we sure visit very often. At least 2 times a week lol. I am Turkish and, I know from first hand that Turkish people are very picky about what they eat :) I asked all my Turkish friends in Pittsburgh and Kebab House is by far the best of all."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with some limited patio seating too (soon enough it won't matter though, brrrr). I like the added authenticity to the place. People play with their phones. I just stare at the wall photos of Istanbul, Antalia, and Yalava I think. Brings back memories of my visit to that beautiful country. I tried the Shawerma during one visit and the Iskandar kabab on another. The kufte was really good but more on the harder well done side than I would normally like. Still very nice and blended well with the yogurt, and tomato sauce. I heard good things about the tender shish kabobs. Will try that next time. In the heart of Squirrel Hill, if you happen to be in the area and like Turkish or Levantine styles of grilling, give it a try. Friendly staff. Can be hit and miss if it's really busy but they try to keep on top of things."}
{"text":"I ordered Adana and Shish combo. It was amazing. Owner is extremely friendly. This place is definitely on my regular list now. Best Turkish/Mediterranean style lamb I have yet to have in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing  Food. Very tasty 
Just right. People Very pleasant. 
Their mix grill is more than enough for 2 people 
The ADANA plate is so delicious and worth trying."}
{"text":"Great food on the expensive side. I had hoped the tea would be free. Just like in Turkey :-)"}
{"text":"Let me get right to the point:  I ordered a lamb gyro, and it barely had any meat in it.  It was not 'bad', but I felt like I just paid 'meat prices' for what was essentially a lettuce wrap.  With so many other restaurants around, my advice to them would be:  Don't cut corners, because in the end you'll lose more money from lost business than what you'd save by skimping on meat.

Service was friendly - server was not slow, but the kitchen seemed a little slow all things considered.  Atmosphere was ok.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I took a few trips to Turkey and this food is identical. Staff is awesome and very friendly. Very delicious, and would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mediterranean cuisine"}
{"text":"Food is very delicious, everything tastes fresh and it has the nice homemade flavour, staff are very friendly, prices are reasonable, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner. I had read the reviews on yelp. I had hoped to get the donor kebab but they were out. I chose the non spicy beef and lamb kebab, the food took a little while to come but when it did I was impressed. I travel often and look for unusual places. This was one of the most nicely presented dishes I have had recently. Not a big plate with fancy sauce painting it was just colorful fresh food. Real potatoes died to provide my fries.
Not the place for romantic evening out but really good food."}
{"text":"Tried their donair wrap. My first time here. It's a good sandwich and the bread is good. They put the right amount of sauces and nothing tastes old. The thin slices of beef are not too thin. It actually makes it enjoyable. The restaurant itself could use some rejuvenation. Old school look and not a place to bring a date. Overall my first take out experience was good. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful. I have been looking for a place like this in Pittsburgh for 2 years now and nothing else compares. The gyro is moist, the Lebne is perfectly seasoned, the chicken kebab is perfectly seasoned and cooked, and I don't know what is in that hot sauce but... Wow. Just go, but go hungry because the portions are big and there's no way you'll be able to stop until it's all gone."}
{"text":"You want Kabob? Stop by here! You would not be disappointed. As good as it gets! We have had pretty much all their kabobs and appetizers on the menu. For desserts we have had baklava and Turkish coffee. Both very good. I just hope they keep the same quality and price range. I feel like it is on the higher price range already (being a casual restaurant), so if the quality goes down or the prices go up, it will make it hard to return."}
{"text":"It is the new Mediterranean restaurant in squirrel hill.
I have been several times so far each experience was superb.
If you looking for a delicious authentic Mediterranean food you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"Quite decent, not remarkable, but solid, not overcooked, and appropriately seasoned. Will return."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. When confirming which kebab was which on our tray, the chef said \"you should know, you ordered it\" and another guest in the restaurant was more helpful than the staff. We will never go back to this restaurant again. The food was mediocre, and no one should have to experience this. Save your money, go across the plaza to Bamiyan Kebab."}
{"text":"Small place with good service. The Adana kebab and beef kebab are indeed mouth watering. Very tasty and the meat very well seasoned. I wish they could expand the place to make seating more comfortable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite take-out places in Squirrel Hill, and the only one with decent Mediterranean food. Their falafel is crunchy on the outside the way it should be (and not squishy and microwaved like everywhere else here), the babaganoush is wonderfully smoky, the moussaka to die for, the Iskender kebab from heaven. Their pitas are ridiculously yummy and not store bought. I love the roasted jalapenos that come with many of the dishes and their creamy lebne.

In short: Mmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"The service was polite and friendly. The place was decent: clean and big glass windows that let customers do people watching on busy Forbes Ave were a plus. The beef and lamb kebabs were not that great. Their sauces or dressing could be improved."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here with friends. Very tasty. Nice portions. Atmosphere is ok. Would come here again for Turkish food."}
{"text":"Super delicious lamb gyro and shish! They have a wide range of Turkish dish and they are real Turkish :) I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food ! I had their Adana kabab and sheesh kabab and it was absolutely mouth watering. I've had Turkish food in Turkey and these guys come very close. The server also took time to offer suggestions  and explain menu items carefully. 

One recommendation, I would have for the restaurant owners is to do something about the table layout. They are densely packed and it can be a little difficult to navigate. The arrangement could be better if they got rid of the middle aisle."}
{"text":"A homeless person came in begging customers for money and the owner immediately came out to give home money. He treated him with such kindness. Great people."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and they didn't honor the reservation. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Walk pass by Stopped for delicious lamb and love it.;)) Do yourself a favor and order it.."}
{"text":"Best kebabs around. I had 1 lamb and 1 chicken. Comes with rice, salad, pita and 2 sauces. Kebabs were so tender and flavorful. Place is small, service friendly and warm.  Plenty of food for my small appetite but I couldn't help eating it all! Great local place.  Definitely will be back. BYO for bonus benefit."}
{"text":"Good was good. Needs a fan place got very smokey had to open the door to let it out making it freezing limited seating."}
{"text":"Love the food - the yogurt adana kebab dish is my favorite! I frequent this place and always end up getting the same thing. Honestly one of my favorite dishes in all of Pittsburgh and I argue has better Turkish food than Istanbul Sofra!!"}
{"text":"Been there few time and enjoyed Turkish food. Portion sizes are quite descent. Friendly staff and clean place. They offer complimentary Turkish tea after food."}
{"text":"Setting (+): It's small, but a lot nicer than your typical \"hole in the wall\" restaurants. 

Service (+): Efficient and attentive staff! This place gets pretty packed during prime dinning hours so I respect that the staff cut straight to the chase.  

Food (+): The hummus here is amazing. I'm usually really picky when it comes to hummus because I'm not a fan of \"lemony\" hummus. The hummus here is just right, not too much citrus and the perfect amount of flavors. The soft and fluffy pita bread is a plus too! For main plate, I ordered the lamb and rice. It was pretty much a deconstructed gyro on a plate with rice. The rice was so rich and buttery, which complimented the drier lamb and citrusy side salad. Overall, a great balance of flavors and textures. 

Price/value (+): Not a cheap eat place, but prices aren't bad for the amount of food and quality."}
{"text":"This place was a disaster. We had to wait for our food for almost 45 minutes.They bought the appetizer after a long while.The food was ok nothing fancy.The service was really slow. Other patrons who called ahead for pick up were getting frustrated. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Taste of the meat is so delicious. If you ever wonder Turkish food and cannot go to Turkey, you should come this restaurant and try."}
{"text":"Let me say first that while I've been to Turkish Kebab House only for lunch. I usually get their Adnana Kebab wrap for lunch. And because it's so good, I have only occasionally has something else from their menu. The meat in the kebab is marinates with the flavorful Adnana spices and the wrap come with two sauces---a hot, spicy, orange colored sauce and a yogurt based sauce, resembling the Indian \"raita\". I use the orange one on the wrap & the yogurt sauce to douse the heat!
Their Iskander kebab comes with pieces of flavorful gyro kind of meat on pita bread pieces doused with a yogurt sauce--another dish I can recommend. 
And really I keep going back for just these two dishes. The service is friendly & the atmosphere, as in most ethnic restaurants, is casual. 
Recommend it strongly!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious take-out!  Great chicken kebab, falafel sandwich. The bread was hot and delicious.  The salad was so-so. Somewhat soggy, and no distinguishing flavors.  Lentil soup is pure comfort food- would be good on a cold winter night.  The place is clean, bright and looks to be family run. Halal meat. We will be back."}
{"text":"The beef shish kebab was pretty good! I thought that the salad that came with the plate was a bit too salty and out of place, but I really liked the meat and rice. The naan and sauces that came on the side were also very tasty. I would say that the portions are relatively small for the price, but I would still come again for tasty turkish food."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday and are of Lebanese descent. Food was fresh,correctly prepared and seasoned. Delish!"}
{"text":"I had takeout here recently.  I had the mixed grill dinner.  It was $19 something.

The food was quite delicious.  The mixed grill had 5 types of meat.  A chicken kebab, a beef kebab, a ground red meat kebab, a ground chicken patty and a ground red meat patty (I'm not sure if the ground red meat is beef, lamb or a combination of the two, sorry).  The dinner came with white rice, bulghur, fries, salad, a white sauce and a red sauce.

The meats were really flavourful, tender and juicy.  The quality was excellent.  The ground meat patties were really small though.  They were each half the size of my palm (and I don't have man hands, I have little girl hands - size 6 gloves).  The kebabs were a good size though.  Four cubes per skewer.  I especially loved the ground meat skewer.  It had lots of spices in it and it was spicy hot too.  

The bulghur was full of flavour.  The white rice was pretty plain but it was done well (not too mushy nor too dry).  The salad was iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, carrots, cucumber and shredded beets.  It was pre-dressed with a light vinaigrette.  The flat bread was just half a portion (the size of half a small pita), but it was soft and fresh.  The fries were regular fries.  They were a little soggy by the time I got back to my parents' house.  The white sauce was tasty and creamy.  The red sauce was like a runny salsa.  

I liked that they put the salad in a separate container so that it didn't get hot.  

If I'm in this area again, I will return.   

It's in a strip mall with tons of free parking.  Decor is very casual.  It's like a typical \"shawarma joint\" in terms of decor and ambiance, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Turkish restaurant in Pittsburgh! The food is always phenomenal! So flavorful and delicious and comes out hot and within a reasonable time. Staff was attentive. Never had a bad experience, just amazing food"}
{"text":"Loved this place!

Fantastic food and great service. They were very busy while we were there, but that did not prevent them from giving great service, like so many other restaurants do.

The owner was walking around and talking to guests. Be aware that this is on Forbes in Pittsburgh, so parking can be difficult.

Thoroughly enjoyed the cold appetizer plate. I don't know what the yogurt dish was, but it was delicious. I do not like baba ganousch, but theirs was good.

Can't wait to go back. The prices were good, and the portions were large."}
{"text":"There are few selected restaurants who makes really good kebabs. The best one I tried so far is this. Everything was excellent. The food was delicious. Complimentary Apple tea is great after meal. We had Turkish famous dessert - Kazandibi. I highly recommend it! Love it. The people are very nice and welcoming... you feel yourself home."}
{"text":"I love Turkish Kabob House. I've never been unhappy and have eaten in the restaurant and ordered take-out on many occasions times. The service in the restaurant is great and every take out order is perfectly packed, with nothing out of place or missing. I always open my take-out containers to delicious, steaming hot food. Its not the fanciest Turkish or Mediterranean restaurant I've visited, but it's clean with good service, and is definitely my favorite in Pittsburgh. 

I most often order the cold mix appetizer. I usually order tabule, hummus, babaghanoush, and the eggplant spread. The sampler always comes with stuffed grape leaves and the other options you can order (bean salad, etc) are also very good. I've also had the shrimp entree and everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I also typically order a Turkish coffee if I'm eating in the restaurant, but have been disappointed with it tasting burnt on a few occasions. My table mates usually get the lamb or chicken Adana and always enjoy it. 

I think that if you're craving good Turkish food, then you should check out Turkish Kabob House."}
{"text":"The food wasn't too good. Don't recommend it. The meat is a bit dry and  a little pricey for what you get. We ordered the Turkish feast ($37) and Alexander kabab ($16) and a drink each for party of 6. Total came to $80."}
{"text":"A fantastic meal!  I was worried going in because the awful Pizza Cono used to be in this location. We split a falafel wrap and the appetizer sampler. HUGE portions!  Definitely get anything. White bean salad and tabbouleh were the best. Absolutely fantastic on both. Great prices, great service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and between the last visit and this visit the menu has changed a bit.  The new menu now has photos of all the dishes so those that don't know can get an understanding of what you're ordering if you're not familiar with this type of fare.

Basically shish are grilled meat chunks on a stick and kofte are more like ground meat ball type portions.  Plates are served with a variety of veggies and/or salads and come with white rice and bulgur.  Bulgar is wheat but it's cooked in such a way that it sort of has the consistency of rice.

Yesterday my wife had ordered a beef shish plate and I had the mixed plate which included a lot of meat.  The mixed had a shish of chicken and beef, a kofte of both chicken and beef a spicy adana which is sort of a spicy lamb kofte meat.  

This restaurant is sort of like a cafeteria that has sort of halfway table service.  It's hard to explain.  You can walk up to the counter and order or have them come to your table to take your order.  You can help yourself to drinks in the fridge by the counter and be charged at the end.  

The plates you are served on are paper and the cutlery is plastic and there's a tip jar at the counter too and when you pay you have to come up to the counter so it's not exactly full serve... like I said it's like a hybrid of a cafeteria style and table service.

The food I had was good and the meat was plentiful.  The mixed plate is just under 20 bucks but getting 5 different types of meat with bulgur, rice and flat bread is a lot to eat.

The two plates with drinks eat in after tax was just over 40 bucks.  

I like the food here and it's a nice change of pace with flavorful options.  

While it took a while to get our food prepared we were only 2 people.  There was a huge party beside us maybe a dozen people or so.  Based on how long it took for us to get our food I could only imagine how long it would take to be served if you were there after this large party.  It's a family run place and they don't serve quick but they are friendly and the food is good quality."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday afternoon. The place is small, so we had difficulty with a baby and stroller, but the waitress was very kind about it. I had the shish kebab with yogurt and it was very good, I ate every bite. The pita is fluffy and the coffee is strong without being overly bitter. I could go here every week!"}
{"text":"my family is addicted to this place. my daughter to the lentil soup, me to the cacik, and the rest of the family to the grilled meats."}
{"text":"Really good! A small little neighborhood restaurant that doesn't really call attention to itself. We tried it when it first open and it was good. We got take out from there yesterday; it was great! It tasted so fresh. My husband and I each got a different type of wrap. My mixed gyro (chicken and lamb) was delicious. Meat, tomato, lettuce and a choice of two sauces; traditional (but, better) gyro sauce or a very hot and different hot sauce. My husband opted for the chicken kabob wrap; it was gone before I could ask to try it so it must have been great. Lastly, we got the cigarettes (I think that's what they called them). They are small thin rolls with cheese in the middle; served hot. WOW. 
Very impressed and eager to go back. Perhaps try dining there instead of taking out."}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced and quite good quality and tasteful. They serve free ayrans and Turkish tea with any order of entree. One thing I didn't like about this place is that they are understaffed. They took a really long time to seat us after we had approached them multiple times and we were almost planning to get take out. Also there are very few tables and the place is fairly crowded and busy. It's a byob place and they have a couple tables outside for outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Must get;
-Hummus
-Meat plate - (Not adana)
-Baklava
-Ciggeretes

This place is awesome! I'm amazed how good they can make healthy food taste."}
{"text":"Excellent brand new Turkish restaurant in Squirrel Hill. This Iskender Kebab was excellent and very authentic. The Adana Kebab was spicy (flavorful, not hot) and delicious. The chicken kebab was juicy, not dry. The hummus very good."}
{"text":"We visited this place last weekend. There me and my wife ordered ayran as appetizer and then tried mixed grill, which was recommended by our server. The food was absolutely delicious! Also, service was excellent and friendly. We are definitely coming back to Turkish Kebab House."}
{"text":"Fresh beef kofte and red borgul like home made style, the menu has photos with most of the main courses, although it takes 20 minutes for the meat to be grilled, it worth the wait with the handcut fries, the borgul is cooked with tomato paste, diced pepper. 

The Nan bread is fresh and warmed on the grill. They have different drinks selection including ayran yogurt and brewed tea, Turkish coffee. My friend ordered iskander kebab and it was one of the best with true authentic taste. The mixture of tomato sauce, doner meat, sliced bread with yogurt is undeniable. 

It's an ultimate Turkish experience and I highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Super yummy kebabs and turkish tea...The Pita bread is yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered for delivery and our food came in about 30 minutes fast and hot. We ordered pita, chicken kabobs, and a cold salad. Everything was excellent. The salad (cucumber, tomato, red onion, and parsley) was fresh and delicious. As was the dressing. The chicken breast was tender and extremely flavorful, perfectly cooked. It was satisfying, not heavy or greasy, and very tasty, a perfect dinner. 

We're not from here, we're visiting from CA...but if we find ourselves in this area again, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is absolute delicious!!! We are literally addicted to this place, if you are debating which place to choose, I can guarantee you will
Not be disappointed!!! 
I love how owner makes you feel so welcomed and  warm, today we were given some complimentary desert and they just go out of their way to do everything they can! 
Definitely consider this place for even parties and small group gatherings too, very casual, friendly place to be, their \"labne\" is to die for \"no joke\"! 
Very happy with today's visit! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Got a Shish kabob plate to-go and it has probably been the worst Shish kabob I have ever had in my life. The service was bad, they gave me the wrong order until I reached halfway home and realized it was wrong. When I went back, the lady was unapologetic and plain rude. The Shish kabobs were chewy and extremely dry. Safe to say, I won't be going back here any time soon."}
{"text":"The service is quick with good customer service. However, I'm just not a fan of the food. Have visited this spot twice now and have had 3 different things on their menu - Adana lamb, chicken. I feel there isn't enough spice in the food and it is bland in comparison to a lot of other Turkish food I've had. I have had to douse the food in the side sauces that come with it to get some flavor."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. The food is not that good. Also they make you order rice and salad. I just wanted a kabob but they make you pay for the meal. Also, the gyro was too salty."}
{"text":"I have been here at least five times and have enjoyed every meal here! The kebabs are all generally very good; if you want to sample them all, I recommend the Mix Grill Combo (good for two people). Another personal favorite of mine is the Musakka Eggplant.

The staff are friendly and the food does not take long. The place is clean and well-designed. I really have no complaints with this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery, I can understand sandwiches being cold upon delivery however I fail to understand why the taste wasn't fresh meat also the Doner wasn't anything like Turkish Doner!
I tried this restaurant twice and I wasn't impressed at all. will not be ordering anymore."}
{"text":"Really delicious, lentil soup was tasty and super hot(temperature) shish kebab delicious, not dry and there was lots of meat, and the cigarette borek was yummy (as with most fried food, tasted better when eaten there than delivery) this is my go to Turkish spot hands down love it"}
{"text":"I had a taste for the Chicken Adana (ground well seasoned chicken kabobs), they weren't available so I ordered a Chicken Kabob Wrap.....the chicken was marinated and flavorful, I started with my favorite Babaganoush.......Yum!
I tried the Turkish coffee which was good served in a pretty cup and saucer.

The service was pleasant.....I'll definitely return soon"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. White bean salad: \"Piyaz\" is phenomenal. Any of the kebabs are great. \"Adana\" effectively means ground meat I think. I love the regular non-Adana meat kebabs. The chicken is perfectly marinated as is the lamb. 

Wraps are good. So is the pita. All around- such an upgrade from Pizza Cono which used to be at this location.

If you have a big party, get the large dinners in the center of the menu- sultans delight and the mixed grill can easily be split between 3/4 people if you get appetizers!"}
{"text":"Best Turkish food in canada eh! Came 3 days in a row and was never disappointed. Great staff as well always friendly and helpful. Must try!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of anything Kebab and from the Yelp reviews on this place I had to check it out.  There was plenty of parking parking when we got there but it was after 1pm so the lunch rush probably packs up the lot.  The restaurant is what I would consider a \"Shik-Dang\" (Hole in the wall) but man was the food delicious. Good for large groups too.   Chicken and Beef Kofta Platters were ordered.  Flavourific!  So freaking delicious!!  My only complaint was that I wish Kebabs were were bigger.  As previous reviews state, all is made fresh, so be prepared to wait a bit or order in advance.  The Bulgar is an amazingly delicious grain type side that come with the platter plates.  Oh so good.
MORE MEAT!!!   LOL.
Peace out!"}
{"text":"Really great food. I ordered delivery and got the mixed grill because I couldn't decide what to get. It's easily enough for two people, maybe three depending on how hungry you are. The chicken and shish kebab are very good. Well seasoned and juicy meat, not dry at all. The adobo is good as well, it's basically ground meat. The gyro meat was seasoned well and was soft and very good with the pita. Mixed grill is served with rice beneath it, and the flavor of the meat soaks into it and was also delicious. I also got hummus, it was basic hummus but still good and dependable. Definitely worth a try, will be going again. Delivery was fast and timely as well."}
{"text":"I spent three years bemoaning the lack of Middle Eastern eateries in this neighborhood, so of course this place opens right before I move out of town, and of course it is fantastic.  I had the Adana Kabab and my friend had one of the chicken dishes and we both loved our meals.  I also had cup of real Turkish coffee, which was delicious.  The service was fantastic: the waitress was very nice and very gracious about filling our water glasses about 15 times during the meal (we had just spent several hours walking in Frick park on a hot day).  Will definitely try to come here again before I leave."}
{"text":"I'm reducing to 4 stars because their quality seems to have dropped off a little.  For example, the gyro meat tasted more fatty, less crispy than previously and got cold quickly.  Pita is now mediocre.  Their \"delivery\" service is abysmally slow.  Sorry guys just aren't top notch anymore...luckily you have a corner on the market."}
{"text":"I will start with the decorations of the store were nice and the lamb kebab that I ordered saved this review from going any lower. I thought the meat was delightful. However everything else was lacking. When I order and salad is brought out I expect the salad to be at least green. It was a brown salad that came out of a bag. I expect that from my house but not going out for dinner. However the dressing was good I am disappointed in its appearance and that's it's pre prepped salad. It came with the standard green pepper, but turned out not to be so standard. The picture and my experience tells me the peppers are supposed to be long and sweet, however this restaurant decided to go against its picture and give me a small pepper that was to hot. The rice pilaf was fine tasting, and the grape leaf wraps were fine however it was not enough to save this meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my boyfriend for a quick dinner and so glad that we did! We ordered the Turkish meatballs and the lamb shish kebob and our orders came out quick! The lamb, rice and salad were so flavorful. The lamb was delicious, tender and cooked perfectly! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I love their food! It is located bang in the middle of where everything is happening. I tried their meat platter, which is absolutely delicious. The meat is cooked perfectly, leaving it juicy and tender. The rice that comes along with it is delishh!! (smack) The food comes with pitas and sides of two sauces - spicy and yogurt. 

Their servers are also very friendly. Our server kept bringing us refills of the spicy sauce, which we were consuming a lot.  She insisted we try the baklawa for dessert. They top it with a dollop of sweet cream. Best baklawa ever!

They do not have a double door system, so every time someone enters or leaves (in the winter season), a gush of freezing air rushes in. More reason to consume more spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday to try out their donairs. I've been craving donair for some time now. I must say that I've had some decent donairs in Canada (mostly east coast) over my 20 years of living here, but none ever compared to the best donairs in the world that I've had the pleasure of experiencing in the U.K. And Germany. There are several folks who have tried to copy the donair, but nobody has it mastered like the Turkish folks. So seeing this place advertise theirs as Turkish Donair, I went out of my way to go see them. 
I've ordered the donair platter with rice and wow was it awesome!! Not quite what I had expected, but still very flavorful and most enjoyable. I'll have to admit that it is the best I've had in this area and I will be back for more for sure!! 
Great location, great prices, great service. Thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"So after coming couple times here and trying many dishes I decided to write a review! This place is really nice, clean and food is so delicious! OMG!!! You should try mix kebabs, so you will try different meat at once ;)  that what I usually do.  Service is really nice, owners are very friendly, and turkish tea is always fresh and ready. 
I lived in Turkey for couple years, and sometimes miss their food, this place is the BEST TURKISH AND MEDITERRANEAN CUISINE in Pittsburgh, believe me, I tried all of them...  Ouu and fish!! If you like fish, you should try it!!! Sooo Nice!! I will add a picture of fish later!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and the kebabs were delicious.  Friendly service.  Dining area was a bit cramped with a stroller but everyone helped us find room.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Subpar service but the food was good.  Although there was only one other party eating while we were there, the servers took a long time to come take our order.  We did not receive any offers to refill our drinks and when we finished, we sat a good 10 minutes with them not giving us a bill or asking how the meal was.  Next time, it'll be Alladin's up the street. Oh and the \"vegetables\" that accompanied the meal was a measly little iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today with two friends.  We originally wanted to check out the Mediterranean Grille across the street, but it was closed.  I whipped out my Yelp app and saw that I'd bookmarked Turkish Kebab House, so I suggested it, and my friends were game.  Seeing that they were open, we headed across the street to check it out.

Since it was lunch, all of us ordered wraps.  In light of the name of this establishment, I ordered the chicken kebab wrap ($8), and my two friends each ordered the mersin tantuni wrap ($7).  I didn't try their wrap, so I can't comment on it, but as one of them is a Yelper, I'm sure she'll review it separately.  As for my wrap, I was quite pleased with it in terms of flavor and portion.  The chicken was cooked well, and was nicely complemented by the crisp veggies.  We were also provided with homemade hot sauce and yogurt cucumber sauce as condiments.  The hot sauce wasn't too much to my taste (this is probably a personal preference, however), but I loved the yogurt sauce, which I applied liberally to my wrap.

Service was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not too fast or slow, or too attentive or inattentive--so no complaints there.  The ambiance is a step up from the former tenant occupying this space (Pizza Cono), with photos of sights from Turkey adorning the wooden accented maroon walls.  Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience here, and would definitely be willing to return for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"So a friend and I were heading to Pittsburgh to see La La Land since it wasn't playing where we lived and really wanted to see it, especially in a big theater and we thought we'd eat lunch before. Turkish Kebab House was definitely the right choice. Probably the best gyro I've ever had. Seriously. Loved it. The lamb gyro was presented on a plate with lettuce with bread on the side. And hell, it was just as good as a salad. Seriously, get the lamb. So as I stop rambling on about good lamb, take a chance and try out this little place. Be cultured and adventurous, it'll be worth it. Normally I'm not but hey, it's a good New Years resolution to try more things."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Turkish food in the area. The interior is a bit cramped but cozy; you can smell the flavors coming off the grill as soon as you walk in. The waitstaff were very friendly from start to finish. Although prices are a bit on the higher end, their portions are very large, and were able to share the mix grill between two people. Before bringing out the entree, they gave us some fresh and warm pita bread, accompanied by two sauces. Both were very good--one was the usual yogurt, while the other was a less creamy, spicier type. When the main plate came out, we were surprised by how large it was. All four servings of meat were extremely flavorful; the adana kebab and gyro were probably my favorites, given how tender they were. Beneath all that was a plate of rice with spices that captured all the flavor remnants from the meat, as well as a modest salad on the side. This one plate of food left both of us stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been to Turkish Kebab House a few times already. I really enjoyed having their pita bread and their hummus. Their rice is also really good In addition, they had a great chicken kofta wrap. However both times I had gone, their chicken gyro was unavailable and we had difficulty finding seating. The staff was very friendly and I plan to go here one more time before I leave Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stopped by Turkish Kebab house for a quick lunch over a weekday. I needed to get back early so I was apprehensive about the service time, but it was not bad at all. 

The place is quite small and can accommodate no more than 20-30 people at once. I ordered the chicken adana wrap which was really reasonably priced (7.5$). I was given yogurt sauce and hot sauce on the side, both of which were delicious. The wrap itself was quite tasty and the chicken was well made and favorable. It was definitely as tasty as other Mediterranean joints in the area. I ordered a baklawa in the end, which was priced at 5$ (but contained 4 pieces) and was quite nice too. I would want to be back some day to try the dinner sized entrées."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting. I had a chicken Adana wrap and they gave me rotten, disgusting sauce with it. AVOID."}
{"text":"This was my second spot to hit up as a part of a \"bang-bang\" (that is when you eat a meal at one place and then eat another meal somewhere else directly afterwards!) and I really enjoyed myself. I walked in and the layout was slightly confusing because it was filled with tables and nobody really greets you. I went to the back and a waitress sat me down and gave me a menu. 

There weren't tons of vegetarian entrees but they had a lot of appetizers. I ended up getting a few of those. In ordered the shepherd salad which is basically chopped cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. I ordered the cigarette borek which was a cigar shaped pastry shell filled with cheese and spinach. Finally, I ordered the falafel platter. It was really good! The borek and falafel were both deep fried but the salads made me feel healthy! 

Now for the best part.. the baklava!!! Hands down the best I have EVER had. A bit crunchy, chewy, sweet but not overly sweet and not too sticky.. and the nuts! My goodness it was perfect. They serve you four of them with whipped cream and chocolate. Incredible! 

I will be back again, however, it will not be a place I frequent due to the lack of vegetarian dinner options."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus. Delicious well seasoned chicken and lamb. Best Mediterranean food I've had in the city so far."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late evening bite with a friend. The falafel wrap was very good. Well done!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I am dinning here. The meat is cooked to perfection. I love their gyro and Adana kebab. The chicken is surprisingly good. The complimentary pita and dip served in a Aladdin's  lamp shaped cups are very cute. Do try their Ayran drink and Turkish tea."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dinners in a long time! We had lamb gyro, Adana kebab, appetizers. Everything was fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb and chicken adana kebabs without rice. I am currently doing Whole30 so I asked if I could get a side of baba ganoush since I couldn't eat the rice. They said no and I that I needed to order the full appetizer.  

The food was well seasoned and delicious. They didn't offer any lunch specials, so the price point is slightly high for lunch, but reasonable for dinner. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Best Turkish restaurant I've been in the USA, the mixed dish is amazing and ayran tastes excellent"}
{"text":"Good - quick and friendly service. Food was tasty and enjoy the spicy sauce. Price is very reasonable for two. For first timers order Mix Grill/Karisik Izgara. The place is BYOB

Place is small about 10 tables. Would come back again."}
{"text":"So good!  I had the best lamb shish kabob that I can remember. Perfectly marinated and chargrilled. The sauces were superb and the pita must have been house made as it was fluffy and had a nice char. I will go back to try other dishes but it will be hard to convince myself not to get the lamb!"}
{"text":"Fabulously delicious!! I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend and found this delightful place on Yelp. I ordered the Shish Kebab, Salmon Kebab, baklava, and rice pudding for myself and my daughters. Everything was amazing!! My daughters can be pretty picky, but they thoroughly enjoyed their food. This was a delivery order, and it arrived within about one hour. I definitely plan to get food from here on subsequent trips! 100% recommended!!"}
{"text":"Got them to cater an event for 15 people. A risky move since I've never had food there. But wow was I surprised. Everyone loved it. 
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decent Turkish Kebab restaurant. But the food did not leave much impression. They taste similar to other Turkish place."}
{"text":"Decent Turkish cuisine with reasonable price and good service. Tried Shish and Chicken Adana Kabab, it was great!"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall restaurant is a gem of a find in Squirrel Hill. My husband and I were wandering around Forbes and Murray earlier today and started looking for a place to grab a late lunch/early dinner. After checking out some reviews, we settled on the Turkish Kebab House.

Even at such an off time of day, there were 10-15 other patrons dining in the tiny restaurant when we arrived. Our waitress was a young woman who was both friendly and efficient. We started with the tabbouleh, which was absolutely delicious. The freshly baked, soft, perfectly browned pita paired nicely with this cold salad of parsley, mint, and onion. I really could have eaten about five servings of this tasty appetizer.

For my entree, I ordered the yogurt shish kabob while my husband ordered the classic chicken and lamb kabobs. I really appreciated that the waitress helped explain and guide us through the menu, making sure that we were receiving exactly what we had anticipated and providing her personal favorites. My yogurt dish was pita topped with mild tomato and yogurt sauces and chunks of lamb cooked to a perfect medium. My husband's dish was the classic lamb and chicken chunks paired with rice and salad which he topped with two tasty sauces delivered to the table, one mildly spicy in flavor and the other a classic tzatziki. 

Don't let the exterior of this restaurant deter you because I can promise that the food will deliver. I am already looking forward to returning to this spot again in the future!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the meat was excellently prepared! The grill platter was plenty for two. The apple tea was a perfect ending."}
{"text":"Quite simply, an excellent place!
Came here with a group of friends and tasted multiple dishes, all of them were amazing! The chicken in particular is very tender and flavourful

The only downside was the lack of space. We did go on a Friday evening, but there was no space to seat a group larger than 6"}
{"text":"My family and I used to frequent an Arabic food place in the same area, but it had apparently closed its doors. My father noticed the Turkish Kebab House's sign and suggested getting some take-away, and we've been in love with the place ever since.

I absolutely love the sandwiches, the bread is so fresh and tasty, it's everything you want out of a piece of proper flatbread. The meat is always fresh, juicy, and well-seasoned, and I am 100% you'll never get a piece of bland or tough kebab here. I also love the pickled vegetables and sauces in the sandwiches, as well, it's something I miss all the time at other kebab joints. I've never had plates, but my parents have and they both think the place does amazing work.

My personal favourites are the chicken kebab rolls and the kofte rolls, while my folks recommend the Adana kebabs any way you'd like to have them. This place is not expensive at all, and the food is incredibly filling, so you'll hopefully be able to try everything on their menu soon enough.

The staff is very friendly, and while wait times can get rather long (I understand that it's Ramadan at the moment and people break their fast at around 9PM, so it's always going to be busy then), I'm more than happy to wait an extra 5 or 10 minutes for a hot meal. I think this place is better than Osmow's (and definitely has better customer service), and that's saying something because we all know how the GTA loves its Osmow's."}
{"text":"Thank you Turkish Kabob House for delicious food!
 For first time I tried the Turkish soup,
 I loved it  very much! refreshing and tasty airan!
 Kabob is just mouse watering! 
Very friendly and attentive personal. 
Firm 5 stars! I'll will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the moment you step in the door as you're overwhelmed with a wonderful aroma of traditional Turkish dishes. The smell of Spiced Lamb and falafel danced into my nostrils better than Hines Ward on dancing with the stars. The grilled salmon with rice pilaf was exemplary the service was perfectly paced and my water glass was always full. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who had a flare for Turkish flavors."}
{"text":"Late night. Super hungry. It was around 10-10:30 and my friend and I couldn't find a place open. Lo and behold Turkish Kebab House's open sign still on. We go in sit down and ordered some food. I ordered the Special Village Beef Shish Kebab and my friend ordered the Chicken Kebab and Lamb Gyro combo dish. 

Needless to say we were very pleased. The beef Shish kebabs were great! The meat was tender and it wasn't dry. The rice was tasty and wasn't dry as well. Same goes for my friends dish. The sauces were really good. There was a spicy brown sauce (didn't catch the name) that was amazing! 

The baklava was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Post city excursion dinner and quite delicious. We started with the hummus which is served with warm pita bread. Tasty and definitely a must have when you come here. I had the iskendar kebab which is essentially chunks of lamb smothered in a tomato sauce as well as yogurt with pieces of pita bread at the bottom. The pita soaks up the sauce and is excellent! Recommend adding the spicy sauce that is served on the side to give it that extra kick. I sampled the other dishes and they were quite good - chicken kebab platter and another must have the Adana kebab. Large portions for some things (in our case the Iskendar) although some dishes are easily consumed. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a chicken gyro but either will be back! Of note, just be warned that it is quite tiny inside so not ideal for very large groups."}
{"text":"Really good Turkish food. I had one of the wraps and my friend had the vegetarian appetizers. The people who work there are very nice as well."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! We ordered Sultan's Delight and Musakka. We also got grape leaves and hummus. The delivery was fast and the food was hot. Will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Someone very close to me took me to this place and I have found very few middle eastern restaurants that I have loved as much as this place. 

The service is great and I love all the lamb kebabs - they are my go to favorites. 

I especially like it because of its unassuming name and \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere. It's located in squirrel hill so there is plenty of opportunity for a casual stroll after dinner/lunch here. 

This is my absolute favorite casual middle eastern place and is tied with Alihans as my fav overall middle eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"Just an update:  The food does take a while to roll out, so don't expect McD's type speed.  Food is freshly made, it doesn't sit under a heat lamp.  If you're in a rush, call ahead and place an order!

I ordered the Adana Burger (spicy) this time 'round and it was hand-pressed, not frozen.  Owner had to ask me a coupla times what I ordered and she ended up making me a chicken burger, so I had to wait for her to make me an Adana.  I didn't mind 'cause I wasn't in a rush and she's a sweet lady.
  
I think the platters are slightly better in value, as opposed to the burgers, 'cause the platters can be spread into a coupla meals."}
{"text":"I've visited the place several times, and always loved the food so far. Food is great (cigarete borek is a must try, and my personal favorite is chicken adana with rice), waitresses are friendly, and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was quite good! You walk up to the counter, place your order and pay. You sit down and wait until they finish and they call you once it's ready. The food platter we ordered took a bit of time considering there was one additional family next to us who were already eating. We ordered the turkish feast and it was good for about 3 people. They give generous portions of various meats that are flavourful with great seasoning. The veggies were a little burnt but everything else was so good that we couldn't complain about a few burnt veggies. One other great thing is that all their food is halal!!"}
{"text":"It is my first time in Canada and this beautiful tasty restaurant . I came three days in roll. I ate Iskender , mix kebab and Iskender again. I love the food, it is delicious . I definitely recommend this restaurant . Family owned restaurant, it is very clean and friendly stuff.

When I come back Toronto again, I defiantly stop by this place"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in the city...King Kebab packs a punch and stands strong directly across from Bamiyan. 

The kebabs are comparable to some of the best in the city (particularly the Adana kebab), the prices are great and the venue is pretty decent as well. The one thing that really hurts this place is their service. Though the management is really friendly, the service can be a bit slow so make sure to go on a day where you're not in a hurry..."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service! Very reasonable prices as well. The lamb was specifically delicious."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal!  The lamb shish kabobs were excellent as well as the eggplant spread.  The waitress was wonderful.  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but there's just too much wrong going on to justify more than 3 stars.

The place looks crappy inside. I guess it's ok for lunch (if you're not actually hanging out with someone) or for take out but I can't imagine coming here for dinner. The first thing I noticed the first time we came here, was dirty floor and a couple of tables with dirty dishes. It wasn't raining that day, so there was no reason for the floor to be this filthy (even if it rained or snowed, a dirty floor at a restaurant is still a red flag). There were only 3 people sitting at one table, so it's safe to say that the restaurant wasn't busy that day. Again, no excuse for not cleaning the tables promptly. We waited for our food for 30 minutes, no one came in in the meantime, and the dirty dishes on other tables were still there when we left. Ugh. 

We got take out from Turkish Kebab House twice. Each time there was a problem with the order (just like other reviewers noted). Apparently, no matter if you place your order in person or over the phone, they WILL make mistakes. And yes, we repeated our order 3 times the first time (the lady taking the order kept asking us what we ordered while we were waiting) and probably 5 times the second time over the phone. Unbelievable. Anyway, we've never actually got here what we wanted (both times ordering for 4 people).  The food we ended up with was quite tasty but the point is that I wanna eat what I wanna eat, not what they put in the bag for me, right? 

So yes, the food is good but you never know what you will actually get (I guess that's a good thing because chances are that you will end up liking your food anyway). I must say that their prices are kind of steep in comparison with other similar places and especially looking at how much food you get (not much, there won't be leftovers). It also takes FOREVER to get your food. Both times the wait was over 30 minutes and there was nobody at the restaurant. 

After last time, I really don't think we'll be coming back here. I wanted to love this place but I was so annoyed with the order mix up (I get grumpy when I'm hungry, m'kay?) that I just decided that there will be no third chance for Turkish Kebab House."}
{"text":"Very poor management. I called them and asked for reservation and they said yes and we were there right in time. When we arrived they told us they don't have enough seats and we have to wait for 30 -45 minutes. When I said but I had reservation they said yes we know but we don't have any space.

I waited for the management and he first tried to say that you are here too early. I showed him that I was supposed to be here in 20 minutes and we are in time and you are asking me to wait 30 -45 minutes. Regardless you are not going to have the table in time. He basically said sorry, there is nothing I can do.

And meanwhile, they had a large table and two small tables ready but instead of keeping them for us, they gave them to other people that came after us.

The management was basically first trying to make it our mistake and then he didn't even try to fix the problem as soon as possible.

Long story short, very poor management"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at Turkish kebab house. The food was exceptional and very delicious. Service was excellent and fast!
Atmosphere,food, service were wonderful.
My future action is come back again with my husband and have fantastic experience again."}
{"text":"Last Summer, my co-op students invited me and our manager for dinner at this restaurant. All of us love Turkish food. One of the students and I have visited Istanbul and longed for decent Turkish food. So, we came here and spent a wonderful couple of hours chatting over dinner.

I ordered the urfa dinner, which consists of a foot-long beef kebab with rice, boulgur, salad, naan, and yogurt. The food was tasty, authentic, and filling.

After our meal, I ordered a Turkish tea. I fell in love with drinking it in Istanbul. I even bought a Turkish tea set at the bazaar the last day that I was in the city before heading back home. The tea here was excellent. I felt like I was back in Istanbul again.

I love the food. I will come back to order takeout after work and try more delicious menu items.

This place accepts cash, and credit and debit cards as payment methods.

{"text":"I decided it's about time to update this review. First of all, I've probably eaten here 20 times since my last review , so that in itself should say something.  The food has been consistent, and quite frankly even better than when they first opened. My suggestions are the lamb Adana wrap, the falafel , Lamb gyro , and any of the appetizers! The lebne appetizer is especially noteworthy. I've had it other places but not like they make it. They put walnuts, dill, and lemon ; it's the best I've had anywhere"}
{"text":"VERY disappointed. 

I was super excited to come here because the reviews looked awesome. We came for dinner and were immediately seated. Our waitress comes over and literally doesn't even look at us, she is looking off into the distance asking us what we wanted. I asked if I could get the mixed chicken and lamb gyro and she responds with \"No chicken.\" Okay, thats fine...I get the lamb gyro instead. I don't think she said anything else to us. We get our food and I think it was just sitting in the back for awhile. The meat wasn't even that warm, lukewarm would probably be a good description for it. My boyfriend got the mix shish and adana kebab. He also said his food was kind of lukewarm in temperature. 

Okay...I'm super hungry so I start eating and about halfway through I started to feel nauseous. Usually I have a stomach of steel, I swear, but this made me feel sick. I ate about half of it and couldn't finish because I felt sick. At this point, I also wanted a napkin but our waitress was nowhere to be found? I saw her put her jacket on and disappear for awhile so another girl came over. She was very sweet, as was the other waitress who came over and gave us a napkin. 

We asked for boxes and the check, and I see that our original waitress is back and taking an order from another table. One of the nice waitresses came over and had to give us the boxes and checks. I felt bad because I wanted to tip well for the nice waitresses but since we weren't their table I wasn't sure if they would get the tip. Our original waitress never returned to our table, by the way. 

I'm just very disappointed because I wanted to enjoy the food here and I did not want to get sick. I basically paid $27 to be ignored by our original waitress and have food that made me feel unwell. I gave them an extra star because at least my boyfriend didn't get sick and he somewhat enjoyed his lukewarm meal."}
{"text":"After looking at a bunch of houses with our real estate broker we decided to take him out for lunch.
He said he knew the perfect place that he goes to all the time that was great.
I have to say i am not to outgoing when it comes to trying new food.
When i herd that we were going to a Turkish Kebab House I was thinking ohhhh nothing ill eat there.
I ordered a chicken Kebab wrap.
Wow it was really really good totally amazing.
The prices were also great $8 for a chicken kebab wrap it was so big I could barely finish it.The service was fast and friendly and the place was very clean.
I would highly recommend this place as the food and service is excellent.
I would definetly come here again and again in the future."}
{"text":"My first few visits to Turkish Kebab House were great. I always got the kofte (wrap or kebab) and it was always perfectly prepared: juicy and well-seasoned. I knew I would keep coming back. However, in more recent visits, they've either run out of the kofte if it was toward evening/night time, or they simply did not have it available (even during lunch hours). This is pretty disappointing because their kofte is amazing and it is my go-to choice. Because of this, I'm going to have to deduct a point from service. When they don't have kofte available, I settle for the adana, which is drier than the kofte and not nearly as good. I wish they would consistently have the kofte, not just 50% of the time. I used to love this place, but now I just go in hoping they have what I want to order. Also, do not get the eggplant spread and if you are planning on getting the hummus, don't expect too much of it. On a brighter note, the Turkish coffee is very good. Definitely give it a try!

{"text":"Every few months I have to place an order for about 15 physicians I work with for an evening meeting that can be 3+ hours.  Every meeting we try to pick a different ethnic cuisine.  This time - Mediterranean was the decision.  Ideally we order via Grubhub because delivery is the easiest.

Over a few days, after checking who delivered via Grubhub - and Turkish Kebab House was the winner - so i began getting everyones orders.  Then...the day I was getting ready to place the order - they were not delivering via grubhub.  That was a disappointment.  

We worked it out that I went and picked up all the food - which while frustrating/inconvenient - it was a nice excuse to get out of the office briefly.

Everyone - the physicians, myself, etc were very happy with the food.  We had oodles of leftovers - but were happy to feed the nursing staff left on the floor.  

Hopefully they work out their delivery issues and continue to delivery in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  We had the Moussaka and Yogurt Shish Kabob which were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time.
Located almost directly from Bamiyan Kabab.
Thought I'll try something new this time.

Nice decor and VERY nice granite tables!
Service was very friendly being a very family biz like.

Food was excellent BUT very slowwww in coming out though.
Don't come here if you are in a rush!"}

{"text":"Very good halal and Turkish food, exceptional service, girls are very friendly and nice

{"text":"Nah..didn't work for us. Gave it a try today..we had the doner kebab and it was yucky..the meat didn't look fresh and the plate was just full with rice and burghul, some salad and with just a drizzle of kebab.. overall wasn't good. I highly doubt we would try the place again:( oh and it gave my hubby food poisoning:("}
{"text":"so gangster my teeth hurt. The mixed grill is especially trill."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant on recommendation of a colleague who said my current go to for Middle Eastern food was not up to snuff (she is from the region).

I wasn't expecting anything fancy but was hopeful based on the above suggestion. The decor is pretty casual and while not dirty, doesnt have the most pleasant ambience.

The service was a bit slow, but not unmanageable. The lamb dish I got was not as moist and flavorful as I have had elsewhere. Furthermore it was difficult to chew. The table pita was decent and the raita/yogurt sauce was good and added flavor to the dish.

Finally, the price was not any better than other places. All in all, based on the rave recommendation I was let down. It is fine though if you evaluate independently from that."}
{"text":"Had lunch there; the adana kabob wrap was tasty and reasonably priced. I think the wraps are probably a better deal than the other entrees. I'd definitely go back and try some other items, too. I'm guessing they don't have much experience in restaurants, because the service, while not unfriendly, was a little bit unprofessional. Not in an unpleasant way, just in a way that signaled that they are new to it."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery musakka eggplant, babaghanoush, mediterranean salad, and grape leaves. It came with warm pita.It was delivered in a half hour, and everything was extremely fresh and delicious, and I was able to make 4 meals out if it all."}
{"text":"If you want real Turkish food. You will find it here. Unfortunately you wont find much of an environment to speak of, but you were just looking for killer Turkish comfort food, right!? Then enjoy."}
{"text":"What a gem. Friendly staff, BYOB. The portions are generous, and the kebabs are divine. Meat is tender, delicious, well marinated. The white bean salad is also a go to, along with every cold eggplant appetizer."}
{"text":"Consistently good, fresh, and ready promptly. Nice portion size. The chicken kebab dinner and mezze platter are our reliable weeknight takeout. The baklava is a special treat."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! I love rice and kabab because smell and taste! The meat is prey juicy"}
{"text":"My first visit here and I will definitely be back. Excellent food and service.  Every aspect of the dishes brought to our table was exactly right.  The pita bread is so fresh and the tapas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food with great portions. Split a chicken gyro and it was satisfying. Pitas were also amazing. Grilled with dipping sauces available. Would return."}
{"text":"I have been here close to 10 times. They serve subtle and tasty flavours. I always used to get the chicken Adana with rice and salad, but last time when I was there, I tried the chicken kebab. Both are my favorites now. Chicken Adana has different flavor profile when compared to the kebab. They are definitely not spicy. Though, I am used to eating spicy food, that didn't matter because they have very juicy and tasty chicken. It didnot come across as a bland dish. 

Coming to the desserts, the puddings they offer are the best. There are times when I go there just to pick up the pudding and treat myself. I don't even care to find out the calories I am gaining by eating that dessert. 

I highly recommend this place if you are going out alone or with a bunch of friends and the pudding is something, that you should not miss trying."}
