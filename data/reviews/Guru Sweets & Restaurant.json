{"text":"I ordered food through them via skip the dishes tonight . after waiting for almost 50 minutes , someone's else order is delivered to me . It includes fish and goat , both the items that i do not ear . Since i didn't have the number of the delivery driver, so i called the restaurant. They neither accepted to fix their fault and send me the correct order nor did they accept to refund my money . When i asked for the manager , my phone was put on hold for 10 minutes . I called back repeatedly to a busy phone , and then finally after couple of tries when I got through their number , i was asked to wait on hold and then my phone disconnected . 

At last , the same guy who picked my phone for the first time answered my call, he just told me my money will be refunded . He didnt even care to ask for my phone number to contact me , i had to force that upon him . 

I am a practical person and i understand that mistakes happen . But just outright denying to fix their fault or refund me the money is not ethical . I can accept your apology and i cannot pay for your fault that too for food that i cannot eat . 

No value for customer , no manager at sight , untrained staff , no ethics .
VERY DISAPPOINTED ."}
{"text":"I have to say that when this place opened up I really wanted to try it.

My wife and I went on a Thursday afternoon for lunch, and price for the buffet was about 15.99.

It wasn't very busy at about 1:15pm; and would say it was around 25% capacity.

Upon arriving we were quickly greeted and free to choose where were wanted to sit.

There are five booths and around eight tables.  My wife and I chose the last booth.

The waitress immediately came over to greet us and asked if we would like to order or were there for the buffet.  After advising we wanted to try the buffet she said that we could start immediately and asked if we wanted anything to drink to which we replied \"water\".

Onto the food.

There is a good array of dishes and courses, from salads, appetizers, snacks, soup (chicken soup with vegetables), vegetarian, meat and of course, desserts.

Now I am not an expert when it comes to Indian dishes, although only in the past few years have I become a fan. (Living in Brampton for 40+ years, I was a late adopter).

When we arrived back at our table, we were greeted by two cold glasses of mango lassi.  What a pleasant surprise.

The waitress (and I think owner?) came by and asked if we needed any help, and I simply asked what a few of the dishes were, to which she graciously described.

I then asked if there was any Naan (as there was none to be seen) and she said that she will place the order.  At this restaurant, it's made fresh to order in front of you (well...at a big open room beside the food).

Ok...let's start (with what I know and are able to say):

Chilli Chicken - Sauce is tasty, chicken is dark meat, soft and not too spicy

Butter Chicken - Buttery, medium thickness, a little on the salty side and nice huge chunks of chicken breasts

Chicken Curry - Just a small kick of heat, not much.  The chicken (dark meat) was very soft and tender

Goat Curry - Very tasty.  The goat was soft and flavourful

Fish Pakora - I'm not sure what kind of fish they put in there, but it was filling!  The fish was lightly battered, but the fish pieces themselves were dense and yet moist.

Tandoori Chicken - All dark meat pieces (I'm not sure if it is the standard) but unfortunately I found them quite dry both on the outside and in.

Manchurian Chicken - This was interesting.  Similar to a General Tao type dish, yet not as sweet and a nice bit of heat.  To me it was an outlier to the rest of the food, but tasty nonetheless.

Butter Paneer - This was tasty.  Unfortunately I'm not much of a cheese fan, but the sauce was flavourful and went very well with the paneer.

Egg Plant - It was alright

Mango Lassi - Thick, sweet and not enough of it! :)

Naan - hot, fresh and oh so filling...keep it coming!

Gulab - hot and body shakingly sweet

Unfortunately I don't know the names of the rest of the dishes; but all I can say is that if you haven't tried Indian food but want to (and maybe are afraid not knowing what everything is); this is a great little place to start.

The restaurant is clean, the food is fresh, the staff is friendly and you can do what I did; try a little bit of EVERYTHING and eat more of what you like!

I posted a number of pictures of the food and presentation; overall quite a large selection.

One last thing - if you have NUT allergies, go somewhere else as there are nuts in much of the food.

A solid 4/5 stars.

Cheers!
Tano

{"text":"We got a take out order on a Friday and were  disappointed with the quality of food. 

We ordered:
Shahi Paneer : really sweet and had a very strong taste of cashews
Aloo Gobi:- absolutely drenched in oil, but tasted ok 
Daal Makhani : The most disappointing item, it ended up being a mix of 3 daals 
Onion-based Chicken Tikka Masala : Upon special request, the chef made us this dish because he didn't have Chicken Curry , this one turned out to be pretty good. 

Both the Lachha Parantha and Naans were under cooked. They had a chewy texture to them which made it tough to enjoy. 

Overall, the food was definitely below average, especially when it came to the vegetarian food items, but I will say for the price that we paid, we got a lot of food. Their takeout containers are 1.5x the size of a normal takeout place for the same price. 

Highly doubtful I will be returning"}
