{"text":"Good food.  Good service.  Nice lunch menu.  Small restaurant with big value that can seat 40.  Open kitchen (like an old diner).  certified by inspector as A - 97.0.  They show they care, especially waitress.  Flexible on things customers desires of food and menu (you can order off the dinner menus if what you want is not showing on the lunch menu for example).  The house soup could be a meal by itself."}
{"text":"Delicious first trip. The couple that owns it waited on us.  Each thing we ordered was full of flavor and we even got a free soup during our meal. The Lo-Mein was definitely more flavorful than many other restaurants in the area. 
We ordered egg foo-yong, saut√©ed beef with ginger sauce, chicken fried rice, and vegetable lo mein. I will add more upon my second visit."}
{"text":"A new restaurant with modest setting but well worth seeking out for exceptional food. Just had the best lunch I can remember in a Chinese restaurant. I plan to return for dinner in the near future and expect to become a regular here. Don't wait to give Shun Jing a try!"}
