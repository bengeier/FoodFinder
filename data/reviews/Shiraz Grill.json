{"text":"Have no idea why this place has a two star average. I came here with my girlfriend and sister today and ordered a gyro combo and a beef kabob with fries. Everything, even the fries, was made fresh to order and tasted amazing. Also, the prices are very reasonable for the portion size. Next time I'm getting the double cheeseburger, I saw somebody order it and it looked awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my top choice lunch places. Great menu and cheaper prices combine for an overall good experience. I usually get either the Lamb gyro or the double cheeseburger. Both of which I have trouble finishing,  which is saying something. Also they're one of the few places with cherry soda in their fountain. Overall I'm sold."}
{"text":"This place is a good hole in the wall if you want a good greasy burger and fries! I would recommend it, but I won't throw out it being some 5 star dining experience. It's a good hidden spot! I'll for sure be coming back to eat! The burgers were good, I LOVE crinkle fries, and it's right by my school. 

Only down side is I hate pickles, and they are hidden at the bottom of your meal!! So beware!? Even if you say plain, it still ends up at the bottom."}
{"text":"As far as food goes.  Decent.  Just use their parking lot.  Came out after having lunch, car was booted.  Was only able to leave after paying Freedom Towing a $50 extortion fee and getting the explanation that \"oh, we didn't know you guys were eating here\"."}
{"text":"As far as hole in the wall eateries go, this one worked for me.  Husband had the MIXED GRILL, which included a couple of skewers of chicken and lamb/gyro (?), rice, fries and a side salad.  At $10 it wasn't cheap, but seemed like a deal for that much food.  The problem was that the meat was not well seasoned, and it was incredibly overcooked and tough.  The rice was not flavorful, and might as well have not been included.  The fries were cooked nice and crispy, but they were crinkle fries that anyone can get from the grocery.  His meal would have been a 0 or 1 star.  

However, I got the small VEGGIE SUB, and it was really nice.  For $5, I got about an 8\" toasted bun with grilled onions, red peppers, jalapenos and mushrooms, topped with a lot of melty provolone cheese.  Once I added the provided hot sauce, it was absolutely great.  Served with plain potato chips, which was not ideal.  We paid extra for side cups of tzaziki, which was a pretty nice addition to both of our meals.  

Not the best meal I've ever had, but a pretty decent vegetarian sub option, so I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I drive past Shriaz all the time and saw that they have Greek-American food. I am a huge sucker for gyros so I thought id check them out for lunch today. The sandwich was mammoth -I could really only eat half and that's saying a lot since I can put down some food. Flavor-wise it wasn't bad. The meat had a different texture than I am use to, very similar to meatloaf and was a bit salty. The lettuce reminded me of sub shredded lettuce and they had some tomatoes, onions, fresh pita and a rather bland tzatziki sauce. The meal came to approximately $5 after tax and they offer a 10% discount for CPCC students which I couldn't partake in but I thought it was a nice incentive. Overall I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to eat here but it's wallet friendly and while not fabulous it wasn't a terrible choice either."}
{"text":"I'd give this 0 stars if I could. Being Pakistani, I'm pretty into Middle Eastern food and I've yet to find an awesome gyro in the QC. I've wanted to try this place for a while but apparently they're only open Mon-Fri until 6 PM. So finally made it over today, and had my hopes high when I saw that they use a rotating spit to cook the Gyro meat (haven't seen that anywhere else in town).

But it was straight up Naysty. Just gross. I took three bites and threw the rest away - it was that bad.  I'm shivering just thinking of the taste."}
