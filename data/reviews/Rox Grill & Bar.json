{"text":"Nancy E.... I think your wrong . You can order 20 wings and get each 5 wings in a different sauce . The only time you cannot do that is when they offer them 20/$10  and I understand because the price is so cheap. The wings are jumbo size and very tasty . All there food is excellent . After all you can't have your way at that price point . The service is friendly and the food is top notch"}
{"text":"Great food great people...right on the corner more people should come and watch the shows here too...the 14th there will be an awesome show soon!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant less then one star. First when you walk into the bar it smells like a mixture of retirement home and stale beer. The waitress told me they had the best mac and cheese in the world made from scratch everyday, it was Kraft mac and cheese or some off brand. Ordered a burger as well that was over cooked, dry, and just barely palatable. This place is a dump stay away. So many other good local bars right down the street with good food and service."}
{"text":"Rox Grill and Bar is a cool restaurant bar. The restaurant area is huge whereas the bar is small. The bartender was very friendly and suggested popular menu items. We ordered a philly cheese steak, fries, and boneless wings. The food was tasty. I also ordered a long island, which was strong. I will be visiting again and I suggest you do as well."}
