{"text":"Long long long wait in drive thru.  For hard freaking chicken strips.  Overpriced.  Overrated.  Food was either overcooked or under a heat lamp all day.   A waste of a good location they could put a better fast food joint."}
{"text":"I simply love the fact that they have Tapatio for your fry's it brings me back to Huntington Beach, CA.. It is definitly a contender in my books for one of the best burgers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, come here every once in a while. The food is fresh, the burgers are good. But we come for the salad! We like this place because it's always clean, and their customer service is awesome as well. Yesterday morning, we had breakfast there. We were greeted immediately by Dominick. His upbeat, yet professional attitude is amazing. I work in this type of industry, and it's awesome to see people enjoying their job. Anyway, I go for the usual....he made a recommendation, which I took. And it was delicious. Southwest Salad Wrap! Yummmyyyyyyy! Our food did not take long at all, but then again... If we would have gone during lunch, I would have expected a long wait time. The tables were clean, and Dominick must have walked around 3 or 4 times, as well the other lady, to ask us if we were doing alright. These people truly do go above and beyond, and it's so refreshing to see."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice. Employees were fair, however the young man, Christian was very nice. Knew his lines and promotions very well. The food on the other hand left something to the imagination. The burger, the farmer brother, was dry. The charbroiled taste was too strong. Tasted like charcoal. The onion rings weren't  bad, but also to dry. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Was so happy when they opened here in Vegas. I used to go to their place in Moreno Valley. All of the food is excellent. By far the best quick salad you can buy!! Burgers are great, breakfast is great. All in all just a good place to eat."}
{"text":"The burger is pretty good.  I like all the discounts they offer. Make sure you check in after getting here and you get 20% off ticket..."}
{"text":"Horrible place I ordered egg whites and wheat dry toast bread and they got all of my order wrong I ask to Pls fix my order and they told me that they couldn't fix it because they ran out of wheat bread, that it was the last wheat bread they had! so they refund me the money and I stayed with no food!! Smh..  It wasn't my fault or cashier's fault, because on the receipt it was very specific how i order my food! The cookers just don't know what there doing!  FIRST AND LAST TIME COMING TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"First & last time here. Service was horrible. Food mediocre. We went at 9:30 at night, place was empty, had to get up and go ask for our food which was sitting up at the counter with multiple employees walking by. Prices high for below average food. Don't waste your time & money here."}
{"text":"After all the hype from other people talking about Farmer Boys I decided to give it a try. I am glad they finally opened the location in Centennial.   I decided to go inside and order to go since it was my first time and I wanted to take my time checking out the menu. I read the reviews for the Farmer Boys location just to give me some feedback on what to order. I decided to just go for the Cheeseburger with grilled onions and I ordered the side of zucchini since that was what everyone was talking about on their reviews. The burger was okay, my bread got soggy real quick because of the sauce. The fried zucchini was huge, they were just okay to me I prefer my fried zucchini to be smaller.   Overall, I would probably come back since the staff was friendly and I'd like to try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! First time I've eaten here. I had the farmer burger and zucchini. Massive portions. Excellent for the cost. The zucchini sticks have a great batter and and huge! It did take longer than typical fast food chains in the drive thru but so worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is always good at this location, but lately it has been dirty; dirty tables, food on the floor, etc.... I came in about 2:00 PM and had to ask to have a table wiped. ALL the tables were dirty. They cleaned my table, but only my table. People who came on after me, wandered around, trying to find a clean table and eventually say at dirty tables. Smh"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try Farmer Boys for a while now. It was well worth the wait, we both had The Farmer BurgerÂ® (Double Cheeseburger with Avocado/Bacon & all their normal toppings). FYI...all the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion and 1000 dressing. The patty is not greasy at all, which is always a huge plus.  I like their combo options too, instead of fries, you can have zucchini sticks (which are huge and amazingly tasty!) or onion rings and a few other choices. The shakes are sooooooo good! We tried the Reese's shake and it tastes just like an old fashion milk shake, thick and creamy.  In all, the food is really good and the overall experience was nice as well. The food was fresh, which made it taste even better! We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"It is not worth your time or money! My first visit today, I ordered a bacon burger and the half and half which was fries and onion rings.   I went through the drive-thru waited 25 minutes and there were only two cars ahead of me. My fries were soggy the onion rings were soggy and tasted undercooked and there was only one slice of bacon on my burger. What a waste of $11.68.   I will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"Raw and flavorless zucchini.  Cola station is entirely too small..people are reaching over each others drinks in an attempt to get straws and lids.  The  tables are entirely  too close to each other.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food i love the milshakes my favorite is the cookies and cream....and  i tried their  Market veggie burger not bad at all.  lite and just rite not to heavey.."}
{"text":"I am sitting here regretting I ever came.  The men's bathroom was broke, no water to was up.  Had to use the ladies.   The food came out looking different from the pic menu.   My burger bread was stale & falling apart.  The chili cheese fries tasted like reheated leftovers.  The onion rings were bland as well.   Only the milkshake was good.   Overall I feel I was robbed of $26 for lunch.   Never again & I will tell all my friends on base & civilian."}
{"text":"Avoid the drive thru.  Burgers were juicy, all toppings were extremely fresh.  Although it is a thin  patty, its very wide & filling.  The sides were meals in themselves so beware (the crispy zuchini was litterally a quartered & fried whole zuchini).  The breading in the zuchini was very light & tasty.  It had a sweet note that paired perfectly with the veggie.  Four people ate for approx. $25.00.  The only reason this isnt a five start review; the drive thru service lacked to say the least.  The guy seemed like he really didnt want to work that night...the burgers were slapped together & had to be reasembled before we could eat them.  Crispy zuchini was thrown in the bag with everything on top causing most of the breading to fall off.  Chili fries ordered w/o onions arrived w/ onions.  I will eat here again, however, it will be a dine in meal."}
{"text":"We were driving from Provo, UT to Paso Robles, CA and stopped at this Farmer Boys for lunch. This was the first time we'd been at one of these and the food was great! I had the Cobb Salad which was excellent."}
{"text":"This restaurant is friendly, fast, and great customer service. The assistant manager Sheyva is awesome. She helped us choose a great meal and for a good price. Their Cobb salads are bomb and strawberry lemonade. Definetly will go back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cobb salad. It was delicious and it was a big Portion too.  The service was very nice!!! I'm definitely coming back to this location!!"}
{"text":"Come and see Steven @ farmers burguers he is Awesome. Love the service provided by him. Thank you Steven for all your attentions"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Farmer Boys, and definitely the last. The first time I had a club sandwich, which was ok. This morning I had the 3-egg combo: a congealed lump of eggs, hash browns that were barely cooked, and soggy 'toast' with margarine. Fresh food and quality ingredients are not a Farmer Boys standard, nor is the level of care when preparing food. Will not return."}
{"text":"I didn't really get anything I wanted here. Ordered a bacon boy, which seems to me like I'd get bacon. It comes with two pieces. Asked for no onion, I had to pick it out my burger after biting into it. I don't blame the people taking the order as they were all quite nice. The cooks need to step up their game, the fries were soggy from previously being fried. I worked at a fast food place before and if you dip the fries twice they mush up. Won't be going to another farmer boys for a while."}
{"text":"Love this place but kind of expensive. Messy greasy burgers. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"They have the best salads. I think the people inside are great. Although I am not crazy about the drive through."}
{"text":"The portions are huuuge. The burgers are great, kinda like a Whataburger (it's a Texas thang) on steroids. The zucchini sticks are mental. I don't know where they grow their zucchini (apparently, they have their own zucchini farm...I reckon on 3-Mile Island), but they are monster huge. Do NOT order 7; you won't be able to eat 4 on your own!   20 bucks for two of us. You order up front then a nice person brings it to your table. Nice family restaurant decor. Friendly staff. Good food. It's A-OK. Nothing to write home about, but we like the place and will likely go back if we are in the area. In fact, I have to go back because I saw some giant onion rings on another table...they look amazing."}
{"text":"Great food but boy are the prices high.  If your looking for a different fast food lunch spot give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. Both tomes i had a buy one get one coupon. The service is fast and friendly for a dine in kind of fast food experience. I love the breakfast burrito, is us always big enough to share with my kids or finish the next day. Although they have a drive-thru i am not sure, i would call ut fast food, but everything is made fresh and timely."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant screams 'country kitchen', the dÃ©cor is complete with awful ceiling fans, floral patterns on awful fabrics, wooden trellises, fake plants, and milk jugs. It felt like someone threw up every awful bit of Homegoods into this place. And to make matters worse, I think every child and adult eating here was at least 30-40 pounds heavier than what they should be. I don't think I've ever gotten the feeling that I actually stepped down a social class walking into a burger joint, even at McDonald's, but this place somehow did it for me. It's like the Wal-Mart of burger joints. So all that being said, if you're looking for a classy joint, read no further. And screw you if you think I'm judgmental.  This is a fast food burger joint, but to make it feel a bit more 'fancy' like some other places, once you place your order you are given a number to take to your table. Only such classy places as Carl's Jr do things like that. The burger took about 5-7 minutes to arrive at my table which isn't bad, and supposedly because each one is cooked to order.  There are many menu options including a Farmer's Burger, which comes with bacon, avocado, thousand island and various toppings, but at 1196 calories I decided to pass on that and go with the Farmer's Classic Double. This burger consists of two 1/8lb patties, American cheese, thousand island, and your standard lettuce, tomato, two dill pickle slices and onions. Everything there is pretty much standard including the plain bun, but the onions were thinly sliced, almost shoestring, doused with thousand island and were a nice touch. I typically don't like too much onion on my burger as it can take away from other flavors, but these were pretty good.  The patties were actually decent, for fast food I would feel safe eating them on their own similar to an In-N-Out patty, unlike one from McDonald's or some other places. Not sure if it was real, but it had a really good char flavor to it, dare I say better than Burger King's, and eerily reminiscent to Harvey's which I miss dearly from my childhood. There was even some pink in the middle of my thin patties, I'm not sure if that was intentional or not because you will never find anything like that in similar fast food places, but I'm brave so I ate it without a worry. Not sure if my stomach ache 30 minutes later was because of this or just the meal in general.  The fries were nothing great, thicker than most typical fast food choices, but not any better. Your standard frozen stadium fries more or less. I still somehow found myself eating almost all of them, and there were a good amount to go with my burger.  And now for what is usually the determining factor for whether I give a place an ok score or not: the value. My entire meal of a double burger, fries and a drink only cost $5.39, which is cheaper than my coveted In-N-Out double double meal, although not quite as good. Still, considering the poor atmosphere and mediocre fries, this is actually a good deal. You can definitely do much worse for a fast food burger and easily pay a lot more. Hell, this is a bargain compared to that overrated crap you get at Five Guys. Granted it is fast food and should almost not even be considered on this blog, but I walked away far happier than anticipated so I won't complain. So if you're looking for something quick, cheap and decent, then by all means don't be afraid to eat at Farm Boys burger alongside some mullet-sporting white trash diners."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here before today. My coworkers eat here a lot for lunch. Today I decided to see what the hype is about.  I thought this was an actual restaurant!!  It's not. It's a fast food joint, drive thru & outdoor umbrella seating.   Arriving just before noon on a weekday, I walked into a packed dining room. How thrilled I was to arrive when I did. Within minutes of entering & paying for my order the line was out the door. Literally!  The first thing I noticed about the order counter is the clutter & the menu is extensive & busy. I had a difficult time finding JUST a bacon cheeseburger & fortunate for me the cashier knew the menu without looking. I still don't know the name of the combo I ordered, but for $9.82 I ended up with a bacon cheeseburger, 1/2 fries & 2 onion rings, & a drink. (If you're a Coke person - they serve Pepsi, Lipton raspberry tea, Dr Pepper & ice tea.). I took my number & sat, waiting for my lunch to be brought out.   Overall, I was impressed with the freshness of the ingredients. Not just with my meal, but with the LARGE salads being brought out. I wasn't impressed with the \"plating\" (on a sheet of wax type paper & round tray), taste, and more importantly, price.   Yes, I enjoyed my meal. My burger was hot, properly cooked. Loaded with more white onions than I prefer & 2 strips of bacon. The fries were fine, not too salty, not to large, no too thick. The onion rings were large (both in size & thickness), lightly battered, but bland. The flavor came from the sweet yellow onion itself. I've had better burgers at  Carl's Jr.    Because it was full the tables weren't properly minded. Cleared? Yes. Wiped down? No.   For $9.82 I expected a better burger then what I could get at Carls or make at home. Will I return? Probably. The salads I saw looked really good & loaded with chicken breast. I'm pretty sure I saw fish & chips on the menu. They also serve brekkie.   Tip #1: mind your parking. I made the mistake of parking next to the drive thru entrance and was blocked by cars waiting in the parking aisle to enter the drive thru.  People are rude, selfish & more concerned about themselves than the fact they were intentionally keeping me & others from leaving.   Tip #2: order your meal for take away. They give it to you in a sturdy container with a bag. Makes bringing leftovers home quick & easy. Most importantly...if you order salad, would you rather eat it off wax paper or from a bowl?  They come with dressing on them...if you order it as take away you can shake your salad & disburse the dressing evenly."}
{"text":"Tried the regular cheeseburger combo.  First: the burger. It's okay. Kind of a neutral beef taste, not bad but not all that outstanding. The toppings: possibly the freshest tasting I've had at a restaurant. the onion was strong, the tomato bursting with juice, and the lettuce crisp and tasteful. the fries are more like french fries used to be, not the bland tasteless ones served by most fast food restaurants. All in all, a nice cheeseburger experience."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice. This time I went all out and got the onion rings. They try to make up for lack of taste with size. I ordered a large and it is quite a lot. But when you get down to it, it is only 7 rings. One thing about onion rings is you need to use savory onions along with a great tasting batter. Neither of these two main things were present. The batter is flavorless and falls off into one big mess. The onions were so hard they were not even cooked. When frying foods you need to make sure things are fully cooked. In this case size makes no difference.   I've had the burgers there and are generally, bleh, same as everyone else. Nothing special. Flavorless meat with so much toppings you are wondering if you are eating a topping sandwich instead of a hamburger.   Not worth the premium prices and bad onion rings."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast. Fast food style, a little better than Dennys and McDonald's."}
{"text":"went to Eastern location for first time. order taker was obviously new, as every question asked, she had to ask someone else.  she gave wrong info on a price- supervisor Andres then refused to correct bill.  restaurant was clean, food fast. staff besides the belligerent, rude mgr Andres, were all very friendly and nice.  Burger and chicken sandwich were \"ok\" but way overpriced. avocado spread made bun very soggy and fell apart. bacon good. Milk shake was not thick- does say real ice cream used in it. no other desserts available.  you can switch your side- French fries, Colossal onion rings or zucchini sticks. I chose the two onion rings/two zucchini sticks. my husband loved them, I did not care for the coating on them. he ate all of them.  other than the offering of the giant zucchini sticks , nothing very special here.  they do have hot breakfast meals which are available at night too.  in addition they have fish, and some sandwiches too on menu.  look at about $11 for sandwich/burger, side and a drink."}
{"text":"I've mostly gone through the drive thru here. Service is very friendly but check your order as it's sometimes wrong or missing an item (like extra ranch). There also might be a slight wait as the food is made fresh and comes out hot. The food is pretty good. I really like the cobb salad. The ingredients are really fresh and the ranch and chili ranch are delicious though sometimes too thin. I always get an extra dressing and it comes in a decent size cup which I don't get charged extra for.   I don't really like the burgers much but I have plenty other places for getting burgers. The fries were crispy but needed some salt. The best is the breakfasts and the fact that I can order them anytime throughout the day. The denver omelet was huge and really good. I couldn't finish it all. The toast was only slightly toasted and soggy by the time I got home so I retoasted it and it was better. I like the french toast a lot. It's 2 or 4 thick pieces and crusty not mushy. That said, the condiments are not good quality. They serve whipped margarine. I don't know anywhere that uses margarine anymore and I really, really dislike it (that's what made the toast soggy). The syrup isn't all that great either but I get my toast and french toast plain with no condiments and when I get home, I use my own, quality butter and syrup. If you're eating in, that would be a problem.  I didn't get the hash browns because I'm not a hash brown fan. I got the fresh fruit and it was ordinary but plentiful. There were 4 orange wedges (amounting to an entire orange) that were sweet and delicious, apple wedges that were fresh and fairly sweet, and about 15 red grapes. I'll keep going back and making my adjustments as needed."}
{"text":"So almost a year of going here about once a month and the rating hasn't improved.  I know it's a lackluster rating, but I do go here when I want a quick breakfast burger (I'll explain later), but don't want the runs like you get from other fast food joints.  I stopped going inside because it's usually littered with older folks in the morning, and that's not how I like to start my weekends, so I hit the drive thru exclusively.  So, coffee usually tastes burnt and the biscuits are lame cake biscuits. Sausage is sparse in the sausage gravy.  They are always very friendly and accommodating to custom orders. As stated before, I don't much care for their coffee, but they are always happy to toss in a couple ice cubes for me. That way I can drink it fast and not have to taste it too much. hah.  I will say my go to thing is a breakfast burger. I just order a Big Cheese cheeseburger (plain) and ask them to put a fried egg over hard on it, and they do. For that single reason alone, is why I come back."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent customer service! Also my family was excited to see that, unlike most restaurants, they serve breakfast even at dinner time!"}
{"text":"Went into this place yesterday to pick up lunch for the office. My dad recommended it and it wasn't too far from work so I thought i'd give it a shot. I placed my order and got my food relatively quickly (to go).   Much to my dismay, when I got back to work the order was COMPLETELY wrong. Our two burgers and onion rings somehow turned into a burger (not even the right one), a chicken sandwich and fries. I gave them a call because I didn't have enough time on my lunch break to go back to get the right order. I explained the situation to the manager who said I could come back that day or the next and they would replace the order for me. I told her I'd be back same time tomorrow to try it again.   Went back in today and saw the manager as I walked in running orders to customers. She remembered my call and got my order started right away. I placed a couple more orders for other co-workers and she offered me a 50% discount on the new orders, which I didn't ask for and appreciated. They still got my order mixed up with someone else (which is what I imagine the problem was yesterday as well), but I caught it this time.   Anyway, enough about that. The food was good. I got the Jalapeno Burger and it was pretty spicy, but the flavors were good and the quality of the ingredients seemed above par for most fast food. The onion rings (which are the source of much debate in the reviews apparently) were okay. My advice: try them and see if they're for you. Definitely better than the fries though. My boss said the Pastrami sandwich was great as well.  Bottom line: It's a new restaurant, orders are going to get mixed up and the employees don't know the menu very well yet. These are problems that (hopefully) will go away after a few weeks. Management was more than accomodating when it came to fixing the mistake, so I'd still say the service was good. The food is good and I will definitely be returning. Just make sure you check your orders before you leave."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite fast food place until went to the drive-through and saw the guy wiping his nose with his hand and serving the food. Yuck! Eewww! When they first opened they were great! They also serve me cold fries and when I asked for them to be hot they re-cook the cold ones. You understand what I'm saying they double dip them in the grease. I will not be going back anymore."}
{"text":"I decided to give them another shot in hopes that I would get some HOT FRIES with my order #FAIL! Once again I get cold fries & a manager named Morgan who seemed as if he could care less. Terrible.  Corporate if you are reading this you guys should address this with your managers.  Not cool that EVERY SINGLE one of your Farmer Boys in Las Vegas serves cold or  french fries that have been doubled dipped fries to customers. Thumbs Down!"}
{"text":"Wonderful svc, the food was Aw3s0me we had the clam chowder in a bread bowl. It's yummy buttery and garlicky! breaded fried zucchini half order and onion rings half order hot do be careful the zucchinies take way to long to cool. My hubby ordered the natural burger with bacon he loved it! One of our party forgot to order but the wait staff got her the order and brought her change back as well. Sup@ place to just hang and talk, oh and get this the serve breakfast FRENCH TOAST! :0)"}
{"text":"I have always had a decent meal here but do need to post the bad. Take out ordered the French Toast Combo. Toast was burnt. It was covered in cinnamon with no powdered sugar. Also had 2 very small piece's of bacon. Posted a pic just how it was before we touched it. Would probably give it a 3 1/2 possibly a 4 but they missed it on this one."}
{"text":"Simple sourdough chicken avocado sandwich order: Chicken covered only one side of the sandwich, had to ask to get it cut as they forget every time I've gone, bread is ruined before opening, missing bacon!!! I've given this location many many chances as I love farmer boys but i'm dissapointed each and every time I go here. Picture added for reference. 11/11/16"}
{"text":"oh my gosh! I ordered a sourdough chicken avacado sandwich with NO Mayo and No tomato. I get home and it is smothered in mayo and tomato. I hate mayo. I called them and they put me on a list for 2 free entrees. I go back the next day to get to Cobb Salads with NO Tomato- Get home and tons of tomatoes on both salads... Gimmie a break.... Hire someone competent to work the kitchen. I will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this place. I wish they had restaurants like this on the east coast. I never been to place that offer fresh breakfast in a fast food environment. Everything just taste fresh!"}
{"text":"So happy they opened a new location near my side of town! I've always loved their food. So fresh and delicious. The workers are always so friendly and professional. My favorite spot for fresh burgers and more!"}
{"text":"WARNING health issue. I am giving this place 2 stars because I know yelp sometimes thinks 1 star reviews aren't real. First off I had to make a second trip here this night because for the 2nd consecutive week they forgot a portion of my Mother's meal. But the big issue was while I was there waiting on my food a customer in the drive-thru was having an issue with something not being on her burger so she sent it back...The cook looks at the girl working drive-thru and says to her \"If this lady complains again I'm dropping her food on the floor before I give it back to her\". Wow. Unreal."}
{"text":"Some of the burgers in the area!!! I have only had breakfast and lunch never dinner also they so have a great salads too . Friendly staff and a discount if you work at the airport and show your ID."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Farmer Boys and I have to say that it won't be our last!  They will be our new \"go to\" for burgers!  We had the Portabella Swiss Burger and the Farmers Burger.  Both were amazing.  Fresh, grilled perfect, flavorful!  Even the buns were grilled nicely!  The onion rings were great, but the crispy zucchini was even better!  Can't wait to come back and try their salads and other sandwiches on the menu.  I also have to say that the ambience is nice and the service was top notch!  Smiles, hellos and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"7/20/16 Decided to try this restaurant chain.  Always heard about it from friends and they were jazzed about the concept.  Having passed by this new location many times and I said to myself and my significant other.... Hey, what the heck, lets stop in. Major disappointment.  While the staff was friendly in the drive thru, the burgers arrived mushy and cold.   I ate what I could and eventually just had to give up.  Number one, it was expensive.   The burger arrived mushy, the lettuce inside was the hard ends, the tomatoes were the ends of the tomatoes.  The burger was greasy and left a film on the top of my mouth and tongue.  I had to spit everything out and give up.  Oh my Gawd, next time... In and Out just down the street for the best burger in town.  Save your money, save your tummy.  I had to swallow my own vomit to get rid of the taste of their burgers.   Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"We visited this location this morning. I will agree the kitchen seemed slow, but the food was hot and our order was absolutely correct. As for the wait staff, what can I say but, wow! All the staff was friendly, smiling and attentive. One young man named KYLE, was the most pleasant, and helpful, beyond what most young people today aspire to become."}
{"text":"A bit expensive for fast food, but we'll worth it.  I just wish there was one in my neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this Farmer Boys since it opened last year, many times for dinner and several times for breakfast.  Initially, the service was fast, the food was good, the premises were clean and the orders were correct.  In the last few months we have noticed a serious decline in all those areas, especially the accuracy of the orders.  Last night was the final straw.  We arrived about 4:30 for an early dinner, very few customers in the restaurant.  When ordering, we spoke very slowly and clearly, as we could already see that this gal was not the sharpest.  We ordered a Bell Ringer combo with fires, cheese only on the burger, and a Big Cheese combo with onion rings and zucchini, no thousand island on the burger.  We made sure that she repeated each item back to us as we had ordered it.  The food took an unusually long time to come out, I began to wonder if she processed the order because we did not receive a receipt, said the paper was out on the register she was using.  When we finally did receive the order, it was COMPLETELY wrong.  The Bell Ringer was loaded with onion, the Big Cheese had the thousand but no other condiments, exactly the opposite of what we told her.  There were no zucchini and onion rings, she then said we didn't order that as a combo.  The food was delivered again, still completely wrong.  Come on!  This isn't rocket science!  We went back and forth for the next half hour trying to have them get the order right, no chance.  We finally gave up and just demanded a refund and left.  There is zero chance we will ever go to any Farmer Boys restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service, and the staff was just great. It was my first time here! I must say the burger was bomb. I will defiantly be back!! Thanks again for the great service!"}
{"text":"What a find! We were trying to find a breakfast place on new years day and struck out twice because the other two locations were closed for the holiday. Pulled into the lot and initially it looked like a burger joint.  We took a gamble (Vegas) and what a pleasant surprise food was exceptional, wife had French toast and loved it,I had pastrami and it was excellent. I highly recommend it.  P.S. staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"12:30 pm on Fri 7/8/16...cheese burger and fries combo...burger patty had been cooked some time ago (easily 30-40 minutes old), cheese was barely warm and French fries were cooked about the same time as the burger.  Eaten here 8-10 times before, it's been up/down for food quality.  When they make it fresh it's pretty good...maybe the customer should cook their own !  Never again Farmer Boys...InNOut's not THAT far away, and I KNOW that's fresh cooked ."}
{"text":"Bad service.. bad service. .. We walk in there this afternoon to try they burger. It was very slow had lots of employee standing around the side of the counter. My girl friend stand in front of them and completely ignore her for good two minutes.  Didn't asked her if she was ready to order... horrible experience. .."}
{"text":"Tried the Veggie Burger and it was ok. I've had better but for the price and fast service, it was good.    The zucchini sticks are good.    The onion rings are huge but not enough batter on them and they lack flavor.    Overall, for a fast food chain it is definitely better than going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I'm really not too sure why I keep coming back here... This is my second time at this location and I have never had an issue with the service which I guess is why I'm giving them two stars. The first experience was just sub par. The food there is just mediocre.   Now, this time around I ordered from the Togo window and I am quite displeased with everything. When I unwrapped my patty melt I found some type of blue elastic material on my sandwich. I'm not sure if it's a piece of a cooks glove or what not but it's definitely not something you want to find in your food.  Besides for this mishap, because let's be honest, sh*t happens, but the onions were burnt, the fries were soggy, and my girlfriends complete order was made incorrectly.   I don't plan on paying $18 for two burger and fries again..."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the second time this morning.  I've only had breakfast here.  For about the same price as a value meal, you get cooked-to-order eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, and coffee.  On Saturday and Sunday their special is the 3-egg combo - which is everything I listed above for $7.  My husband got the BLT sandwich which is said was good for the price and had just the right amount of bacon.  It gets the 4th star because it's a nice and clean restaurant with fast service and very little waiting - which is not what you get at the more popular local breakfast places.  For a good quick hot made-to-order breakfast, you can't go wrong here.  There will not be fancy food options - just good old-fashioned breakfast items."}
{"text":"OK, so here we go again! My second new restaurant in 2 days coinciding with my second yelp in 2 days as well... Unlike the birth of my children this stop happened by total accident! I wanted a great burger and didn't want to make the drive to California to eat at my favorite IN-N-OUT joint (because for some reason the ones there taste astronomically different from the ones here in Vegas?) So I decided to try this spot for the first time after hearing such great reviews about it on my Facebook. The decor is, well... Farmer-ish? Hence the name, I guess? I do have to point out that I was surprised at the menu and how extensive it is. They have everything from burgers and fries to soups in a bread bowl! However, take note that the day you decide to add on a few pounds by eating at this restaurant; the fried zucchini is a MUST HAVE! They are not only delicious and served with 2 sides of ranch,but they are HUGE!!! I mean almost 6 inches! ( you can't go wrong with 6 inches :)... of zucchini, I mean.) The burgers, which are grilled perfectly, also have add-ons like bacon,avocado,mushrooms and jalapenos, to say the least. But that truly was a $6 burger! Fries are \"OK\". From what I read they seem to have pretty fresh produce that is used within days of being picked since they are based out of California. Also, they use 100% real ground beef. No fillers, no hormones. All in all this is a pretty good burger joint and when I'm in the mood for a 6 inch zucchini and a great burger , I won't mind breaking my bank again for this place since it was $22 just for two burger combos. Good job Farmer Boys... Good job indeed..."}
{"text":"I read somewhere that this place was voted best burger joint. After paying close to $16 for two mediocre burgers and fries, I was extremely disappointed. If it wasn't so expensive, I would give it 3 stars, but the hype and price turned me off so much I doubt I would return. I would rather buy 2 Big Macs for $5, that taste better then what I overpaid for at this place. In fairness, I only went once, but I am not motivated to pay upwards of $6 for something so average."}
{"text":"Just got home and wanted to write this review while I was still in shock. My husband said do you want to go to IN -N -OUT? I said let's try somewhere new. I told him about this place I saw called Farmer Boys.  Walk in no one there, which should have given us a clue. My husband ordered the California BLT which might have been great for someone who likes their bacon raw. I ordered a cheeseburger and asked if I could get it with no cheese. Well I got a burger on a doughy un-toasted bun and that was all. NO ketchup, mustard , onions, or any kind of sauce. Nothing but a plain hamburger on a way to soft bun that tasted like dough. uhg !!! I asked the girl if I could get some onions, she said \"sure, I will bring them to you\". She never did , and we tipped her $2 when she brought our food. It was just awful food.I swear my husband had one bite of his sandwich and I had one bite of my hamburger, we ate the fries took our sodas and left the food on the table because it just wasn't edible. Ended up at IN- N -OUT. $18 wasted at Farmer Boys.  People stick with what you know. What a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Natural burgers 5/5 (excellent)  Regular cheeseburger 3/5 (no different than any other fast food burger)  Onion rings 1/5 (no flavor) French fries 1/5 (always soggy and cold)  Breakfast 3/5 Service 0/5  Every single time we order here at least one thing is wrong. The worst experience is when my family went here, they got two orders wrong, took 20 minutes to bring out the replacement and it was still wrong. 40 minutes after ordering I was done with them and I told them to keep it and went to a competitor."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and fried zucchini. There french toast is really good challenges most high end breakfast spots."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, this one is pretty delicious! I can't get over their all-natural guacamole bacon cheese burger, and their zucchini sticks are delicious and HUGE too.   The staff is friendly. The place was pretty busy when I went, but even so, the wait wasn't too long for our food. No need to be put off by a line-- they'll get the food to you in good time.   I've only been here twice so far, but I definitely plan on coming back a lot more!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice and clean; employees were friendly and I really liked the zucchini sticks...   But the prices are very high for fairly small portions of fast food I feel I could make better at home.  If I'm craving zucchini I might go back, but otherwise I think there are better sandwich/burger-type places nearby... for a much better value.  A solid 2 stars."}
{"text":"Really had an awesome experience here tonight. I think the Employees here asked us at least 6 times if we were ok or needed something else. I have been to very high calibur places that did not give us the service that this restaurant did tonight. We will for sure be back to see Tiffany  Hand! What a great Customer service person she is!"}
{"text":"Nice place to enjoy good made to order food.  Affordable food, orange juice was $3 and some change. Still not bad."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but waiting times are not. Allow 15/20 minutes for drive through service. The purpose of the drive through (having a fast service) is therefore not fulfilled. Still, they're fried zucchini is really good as well as some of their hamburgers."}
{"text":"Tried it twice for breakfast. Breakfast sandwich is ok but the coffee is terrible. Bad burnt and stale taste to it. Won't be back for breakfast. Might try another meal."}
{"text":"Sooooo Saaaaaad for your location! Arrived to have dinner with family and as we exited our car near the front door, a very nice employee (busy cleaning a bunch of carpets on the sidewalk) informed us we were welcome to come in, but only for takeout orders...when asked why, he informed us that inside of the restaurant was a disaster area and as there were only two of them to clean up, there was nowhere clean for us to sit and eat our meal....also \"drive through\" blocked off, so no drive through available either!   I hope your owner and managers read this and take a good hard look as to how much longer your location will be open given that this is a Friday night, barely 7:30pm, and you're unable to accommodate even one family of three in your filthy restaurant...the reasons for this are unacceptable and inexcusable from a business standpoint as there are a multitude of additional dining options surrounding your location.   Hope you are able to resolve whatever problems you are having, as I really enjoyed dining here, but won't be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Came here the first day they were open, they were still doing training so we had a lot of \"hold on\", and \"how do I\" but they were all nice. Very empty so they came by to check on us every five minutes. One girl even asked to take my plate when it still had fries and one was in my hand. Upon leaving we had 4 people tell us to have a good night and the shift lead hold the door for us."}
{"text":"Great customer service! My family walked in 10 minutes before closing and the staff was friendly and very nice. Food is always great. But we loved that they didn't make us feel rushed...told us to take our time and enjoy. We will definitely be back. Whoever is training their staff is doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant.  2nd Vegas area store for a Southern California chain.  All food is prepared to order, so you will wait a little longer, but its worth it for the fresh, hot food.       I ordered the fish and chips and was suprised to find actual fish filets with the tails still attached.  Not processed fish type logs.  Tasty, hot fries were also good.       Overall a nice fast-food, sit-down type restaurant.  Good for breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I've come to this Farmer Boy's two times. The first visit was excellent, I ordered and loved the country fried chicken and gravy 'go bowl' (5/5 stars). I added a little cholula hot sauce and it was perfect. I didn't even have to ask for any of the yummy sauces because they were already on the table; tapatio, cholula, ketchup, etc. (5/5 stars) I ordered my meal with their fresh squeezed orange juice and found a spacious booth. I finished all of my food and was excited for what I would try on my next visit.  Today's visit was a 180 turnaround for the worst. I ordered the barn burner which is a cheese burger with jalapeno, pickles and all the fixins. I ordered it to-go and maybe that's where it all went wrong. Usually when you take something to-go, your food is still hot unless you're driving across the country! I drove across the street and I kid you not, my bun was cold and crumbled a bit as I tried taking a bite. My meat patty was cool and I was very disappointed(0-1/5 stars). I was starving and didnt have time to take it back or go anywhere else so I took three bites and tossed it away.   I'll give these boys another try, their staff is always great and very helpful.  I hope they can cook my food to order as they advertise."}
{"text":"Got food to go 3 times, and all times was wrong!!! First time asked for guac on side, it was on burger, ordered ff and rings, and got rings and zucchini, second time turkey bacon melt had no bacon, third time kids burger was burnt!! Del taco  has better burgers than here!! When is upper management going to read these reviews and higher better cooks and MGR I'm never going back again too much competition"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and asked for a second to look over the menu, didn't get a reply so I just browsed the menu. A few seconds later I hear \"You ready yet?\"  I politely said no I need a moment more. When I was ready I said so and got no response. I waited about a minute and said something again and the lady said \"Yeah! Go!\"  Should've left then.  I placed my order and got to the window and the woman jerked my card out of my hand. No Hi, no smile, no order total, just mean. Should've left then.  Took about 10 to get my order which was fine because I assumed it was cooked fresh. When she(Algerina) handed me the order she started jerking her arm out of the bag handles like she didn't want my gross Joe public hand to touch hers. Spectacular service indeed.   I get home about 8 minutes from the restaurant. Everything is cold but the salad.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Food quality is good for a QSR. Second visit today. First visit was much better. I ordered the french toast combo for breakfast with bacon, sunny-side up eggs, with a coffee and a water.  I asked for they syrup and butter on the side. After payment, I was given a number and was told to wait at my table. There were six other customers in the restaurant at the time. I waited about ten minutes before my meal arrived. (Not too bad for a nearly empty restaurant!) The waitress brought a plate and asked if there was anything else I needed. Noticing the butter was already applied to my french toast, I replied that the butter was supposed to be on the side. She said she could have it remade, but I said it was fine. I also asked about the coffee and water I ordered, for which she promptly returned with. To me, sunny-side up eggs should be runny. The picture on the menu shows eggs prepared that way as well. My eggs had been cooked until the yolks were hard. Yes, I ate it all anyway. No need to waste food, but please step up on your game!  Somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant hits the spot between a fast food joint and a diner. I had a California omelette and my friend had the french toast combo. Both were good. Service was quick and the pricing is fair."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I've been to. I've been to many locations in California and Nevada and never been treated the way this location has treated me. They would not accommodate any special requests made to my order. And extras are charged at a higher rate than any other store I've been to. Do yourself a favor and go to the Las Vegas Blvd and civic center location over this one, it's only a couple of miles away."}
{"text":"So very disappointed that this brand new restaurant has restrooms without a baby changing table or handicapped accessible doors. When I asked for a comment card I was told they didn't have any. I was given a business card for the manager and was told to email or call her with my comments. Wee won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The friendliest staff at any restaurant I've been to. Onion rings are colossal, zucchini is to die for and their ranch dressing is out of this world. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Eat a lot at farmer boys in socal the food here was great and the serves was great they need to open up more here in Vegas very clean friendly place if you are in the area and want good food go there"}
{"text":"Price may be high for burger 10 combo, but the quality is good but not taste as good as five guy or in n out, the restaurant is half fastfood and dine in, staff is friendly, well come back again"}
{"text":"I went the other day with my girlfriend and the service was terrible. Not on the employee parts but on the manager parts. There must be two Maria's there, but I think the manager Keonne told me that her last name was Megunda, had the worst attitude I've ever seen. My girlfriend asked for her zucchini chopped and this lady had the audacity to say no. Now I understand if you can't do certain things, but when she's gone in there in the past and asked for the same thing, the cooks, employees or other managers never had a problem with it. I do think there are managers there that should not be. If this is how she treats all of her guests then you can count my business out.   On the flip side of all of this, Dominick and Alejandro are amazing employees. They made sure our table was prebussed, food was out on time, offered to refill my drinks, I was very impressed. THAT'S the service I like to see. If I ever came back it would be due to those two kids right there. Quality of food, was still good. Service and management not too impressed with."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times during my 12 day stay in the area. Excellent location with very friendly staff. The interior dining area is a clean place with very good food for reasonable prices.  One highlight was the southwestern salad which is a special right now. Fantastic salad in a huge bowl. The veggies are very fresh and the dressings they provide are great.   The barn burner burger was juicy and spicy just like it should be. Paired with the onion rings which were crispy, and by far some of the biggest rings I have seen, made a great meal.   Breakfast was very tasty too, hotcakes are really fluffy, bacon is crispy and the pork sausages they serve are very tasty. No bland meat sticks here, just honest breakfast food that tastes a lot like you would make it at home."}
{"text":"If you are expecting diner quality burgers, farmer boys is sub-par.  If you are expecting fast food quality burgers, farmer boys is outstanding!  The prices are closer to what you would pay in a diner, but so are the portions. The meat lacks juice and flavor, but the fresh vegetables are excellent.  Also, the milkshakes here rock!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location several times and they get my order wrong every time. In fact, the only one time they have gotten it right, there was a hair in my food.  Today I ordered, they got it wrong, I told them and the remade my order, and they got it wrong again. The manager came over and just said \"sorry\". I walked away with the wrong order because I was tired of waiting. The girl taking orders was texting on her phone in between customers, and wrapping silverware after handling money. I work across the street so this is a convenient location for me but I'm tired of wasting my time and money getting crappy service."}
{"text":"Great portions, Good food, Reasonable price. Fantastic Onion rings. Yeah not the best burger ever but, at the very least its passable."}
{"text":"It's really clean and decorated very well and feels like you're eating in a restaurant.  I love their burgers, I always get the Farmer burger combo- it's the best.  Their burgers remind me of California burger joint burgers and they have amazing onion rings, fries, and their fried zucchini are fantastic.  The only thing is that they don't carry Coke products, they have Pepsi instead.  Also, the prices are kind of high even though I think the food quality is worth it I advise you try their daily specials.  On Friday they offer the Farmer Burger combo with fries and a drink for only $6.99.  The only non-burger item I have tried is their country fried chicken breakfast bowl and I regretted not getting their burger."}
{"text":"My three children and husband and I visited this establishment for the first time since moving to Vegas a couple mobs he ago, and it was awesome. While the prices are a little high, their food was delicious and high quality. My son is not stoped talking about their burgers!!! We ordered quit a bit of food , so it was a great way to taste most of what they serve. Even their grilled cheese was to die for"}
{"text":"Awful service and they never get your order right.  When I contacted the restaurant about how I was missing items from my order, they offered a coupon for 2 free meals (not that I would ever go back!)  Their Farmer burger was underwhelming, unseasoned, and COLD.  This establishment has some major issues; until they are resolved, I am never coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent \"fastaurant\" food, and courteous staff. They bring you your order, and will offer free refills on your fountain drinks. I had a Club Sandwich, a Cheesesteak, and a Turkey Melt, all delicious, and all served with yummy steak fries."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Told our friends and family we love it and tonight we got to use our gift card. Yay The zucchini sticks are AWESOME and they aren't the little ones they are the whole zucchini!!! The onion rings are gigantic and delish... The burgers are to die for. They serve lots of other things like soup bowls, salads and breakfast. The fries are good to. Long story short it's a good all American place to get great food!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing friend zucchini the best I can eat them all day realky enjoyed the friendly cashier too. Thanks a bunch"}
{"text":"After waiting close to 20 minutes and being the only car in the drive-thru, fries were cold, soggy, and tasteless. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the past two weeks and they just CANNOT get my order right, EVER!  That's why I had stopped going here months ago, but thought I would give it another chance.  Wrong!"}
{"text":"Always good food, quick service and good portions. Very reliable. One of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"New to Vegas and the food was okay. The wait was very long, some of the food was bland. The onion rings had no flavoring. The staff was very nice and the atmosphere was very welcoming and family oriented as well!"}
{"text":"This location is usually better than this. The Hearty Club Sanwich I purchased was pressed flat and was wet. I have had this sandwich before, this one was a gross failure and went in the trash. 1/8/2015 Order# 226 6:08pm Drive Thru."}
{"text":"Check your food for hair! We've been to this location several times and it is just getting worse and worse. The hair wrapped in our food would have been bad enough but the manager had the nerve to tell us that the 3 to 4 inch black hair that we found \"did not match anyone that works there\". Last time we went we had a problem that was also not resolved to our satisfaction. Unfortunately they have mishandled things so poorly the last few times, we probably won't ever return. Because of the price and the idea of fresh, we kept giving this place a chance. But there always something WRONG with our food. Things were over cooked or under cooked, cold, or just plain bad. We understand there are mistakes but there's plenty of places that will not give this kind of horrible customer service too!"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys has officially lost me.  First time I ate there, it was great!  Last time I said I'd never go again because they messed up both our orders, didn't handle it well and the food didn't seem as good, in general.  This time...  I only gave them another chance because I had a coupon and it's been so long since the bad experience, I thought it might have been a fluke.  Nope.  #1 - I did the drive thru, which took so long I could've taken a nap (even with only 1 car in front of me).   #2 - There was a sign on the drive thru window stating they ask for ID for all debit or credit card purchases for my protection...  ok, cool.  They didn't ask for it.  #3 - I ordered a combo and was asked if I want zucchini or onion rings, even though the menu says choice of any 2...  zucchini, rings, fries.  Because of the way they asked, I figured they meant in addition to fries...  I knew I shoulda asked to make sure...  Because on the rare occasion I hit a burger joint, I want fries.  NOT 4 pieces of GIANT zucchini...  it's way too much zucchini.  So I'm not even going to eat it all.  #4 - The burger is super flat.  This meal would've been over $10 without a coupon.  Yikes!  Not worth it at all.  There was a lot of bacon, but so what... it's on top of a hockey puck.  Farmer Boys...  at least this location...  is off my radar for good."}
{"text":"Order was wrong. I had an appointment to go to not far from here so I decided to get some food. I went through the drive thru. I asked what was in a specific wrap and the girl taking the order, that was about age 17 or 18, said it's the same thing as the salad just in a wrap. Ummmm okay? The drive thru menu does specify that soooo how am I supposed to know what comes in the salad?? So I told her idk what comes in the salad and it was then that she finally told me. I told her I want that wrap but NO ranch, only BBQ sauce. I said it 3 times and what do I get?? A wrap with ranch and no BBQ sauce! Thankfully I wasn't far when I discovered the mistake. I made a u-turn, drove back, and asked for a refund. I didn't even want to wait for them to re-make because I was so irritated. Plus I had to go to my appointment. So here I am hungry at my appointment because they couldn't get one simple request right."}
{"text":"dont take the drive thru!!!! 15-20min wait with literally no line inside or outside for two ppls orders  burgers are decent"}
{"text":"the meat taste fresh, the fish sticks are good I also enjoy the chicken wraps & strawberry shakes ummm. Good service at the restaurant"}
{"text":"We had the pastrami burger ,lots of juicy tender pastrami and if that was not enough a burger to boot.  We always enjoy our meals here. ."}
{"text":"I have commuted by this place for a while, and decided to grab some dinner for the family. The place is really clean, lots of home-y accents to decorate the place. I was going to do the drive thru but went in so I could make a fair review on here. Staff was friendly, and a fairly big menu. Ordered a pastrami, bacon cheeseburger, and chicken strips kids meal. Had the food out the door in 15 minutes. Food was fresh tasting for fast food options. French fry orders were quite large. Just one order fill one of our dinner plates... Pastrami was tasty too (in chibata bread). Only complaint was that the burger was noticably thin. Will go back again, no rush though..."}
{"text":"Went to Farmer Boys last Wednesday with my husband since we had heard a lot of great things about it. We walked in a African American lady was up front I assume she was the manager since she was the only one with different color shirt. . Her Co worker greeted us  while she just stood there and  looked at us like if there was a problem.  Finally she decided to take are order, while taking are order she was very rude when I asked what was all the ingredients they used for the Bbq wrap.  Not only was she rude but it also seem she was drugged out or intoxicated with something. I just think it's simply wrong to have such horrible service like that. The food was great but the service was horrible. Never again will I be visiting that location again.  Thank fully I live in Arizona"}
{"text":"The worst farmer boys I've ever been to. This my last resort because the service is so bad and so is the food. Last time I came to dine in no one would take my order even though it was an hour before closing. Then as I left pissed, the employees had the audacity to laugh."}
{"text":"Sad to say but they've changed their quality on the chili cheese fries. They're a quarter the original size, the chili tastes a bit sour and the onions were really thickly sliced. I'll never be ordering them again unfortunately. They still have other decent options."}
{"text":"I don't recommend going to this place. Yes we went 15mins before they close but everything was horrible. They put old leftover food in our bag. Our fries and onion rings tasted days old. Put my sandwich at the bottom to make my bread thin and warm. Never again!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten lunch burger, salads , wraps and they are all good! The only bad thing about this place is the drink area kind of a pain. The staff are always very friendly.. Give it a shot you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"First time customer........Meh. Ordered the 4 piece fish and chips ( should have ordered the 3 piece) which comes with a side salad. Salad was chopped(which I like) but a lot of the lettuce was discolored. The fish was good, could have been cooked a little longer to get that golden brown color that is associated with fried fish. Tarter sauce was good. Not sure if they have malt vinegar there but I didn't think to ask for it. The fries were ok, nothing great. The platter does come with 2 huge onion rings that really have no flavor. 2 pieces of toasted ciabatta garlic was real good. I would be back to order that again when in the fish n' chips mood. The other thing that was ordered was the Farm burger. My friend wasn't too impressed, said it was ok. It is huge and messy, has good flavor but just ok. Zucchini sticks. BE CAREFUL - they are huge. But again, not impressed. Could use more batter and again, fried a little longer. The saving grace here was the ranch to dip them in. So there you go, another mixed review for this place. 3 stars because I can't give a place 2 stars if I do plan on going back someday even if it's just for the fish."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place to stop at ! If your feeling In need of a good burger this is definitely the place ! Very nice staff. Treat you very well and nice service! Prices in my opinion are normal like you can go to a different burger place and pay the same but not for the quality of the burger! Definitely GREAt!"}
{"text":"I live right up the road from this place so I'd say we've visited more than 10 times. And not once did I have a bad experience dining in or drive thru. Drive thru does tend to take awhile, but what do you expect with made to order? Their customer service has been nothing but great. Everything I've tried was delicious. My favorite must have is the fried zucchini. Another plus is downloading their app. Scan your receipt and for every $60 you spend you get $5. They are on the pricey side but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Checking in for breakfast before heading to the Car Specialist so this was our first time eating out here. Place is very spacious, clean and decent. Ordered a French Toast Combo which is good but it's just mediocre taste similar from other fast food joint. So, I have no complaints with the similarity taste, however, I ordered hot chocolate along with it and somehow the server told me they had to clean out their hot choco machine, alright, fine!! I will wait. Oh boy, patiently waiting and my throat is getting drier and I am getting anxious already because I finished my entire meal without my drinks. Did I get any credit for it? They handed it to me so late. They could have at least follow up and ask if they can get me something else or blahblah. Overall, it was still a nice place and maybe will come back in the future."}
{"text":"the ranch here is so good, take the extra home ;) we got the hot cakes today and they were really yummy! I havent eaten anything here I didn't like yet! love the service, I reccomend everyone comes here at least once!"}
{"text":"I work right down the street from this place and it's awesome! I come here at least a few times a week from breakfast to dinner.  Everything on their menu is great with a little bit of west coast flair.  Staff is great, place is always clean, prices aren't that bad! Just keep an eye out for their coupons they put out at the beginning of the month and you can get some great deals!"}
{"text":"OK.  A mixed review.  The wife and I did our normal thing at Farmer Boys and split a Farmer's Club Sandwich meal.  As usual, the sandwich, fries, and soda pop were all excellent.  Unfortunately, there are the usual problems:  the meals are all too big and the prices are too high.  As I noted, above, the wife and I split that meal (1033 calories for the sandwich and 514 calories for the fries) and it works out fine, that way.  I can't imagine how a single person eats at Farmer Boys:  maybe with a kid's meal.  The single meal cost us $12.64.  That's just too much money for a sandwich, fries, and a soda pop at what amounts to a slightly upscale fast food restaurant.  There are also a couple of other issues with this location.  First, it's darn cold in there.  They have long vents along the outside of the eating area that blow cold air directly down on the people seated in the booths.  If there were some kind of diffuser or re-director on those vents, it would be fine.  But, with the direct air flow, it's just too cold.  Second, even though I've already complained that the meals are too big, my piggish self wants to say the amount of fries we got was a bit small (though they are really good).  And, finally, it's noisy as heck in there.  It's noisy enough that it's hard to be heard at the ordering counter as well as being miserable in the eating area (and that's a hint to people who bring their screaming kids into a restaurant and just let the kids continue screaming throughout the meal).  So, overall, really good food (though too much of it) at too high a price for a not very pleasant dining experience.  Three stars out of 5."}
{"text":"Excellent food (both quality and quantity).  My stuck-in-the-80s price consciousness wants me to say it's a bit expensive, but, really, it's not.  The prices are about average for this kind of place nowadays.  And, considering the quality and quantity of the food, a good case could be made for saying it's IN-expensive.  If my wife and I could agree on a meal, we could very easily eat too much with just one entree.  So, food and price-wise, no problem.  The reason I'm bringing it down a star from 5 stars is because it's a stand-in-the-line-to-order kind of place and the line management is a bit lacking (single-queue, multi-server -- but the line location is odd).  That's probably not worth a whole star down, but I can't do half-stars.  They'll be opening one of these really close to our house fairly soon.  We'll be there."}
{"text":"My family and I came here right before our trip back home, & it was amazing. I ordered the chicken and gravy and it was delicious. Everything is at a fair and good price. Sonia is a server there and she was so nice. She really interacted with us and made sure we were happy with everything. 100% recommend. Good food and customer service."}
{"text":"We just moved our warehouse to the North Side and good food places seem to be a little hard to find!  I found Farmer Boys by accident and I am so glad I did. It is hidden behind a Taco Bell on Craig and Lamb.  Their chicken sandwichs are great. they tase fresh, not like they were made and waiting for you on the heat lamp!. Make sure you get your sammy on their buns. They are soft and yummy as opposed to the sammies they serve on reg bread..meh We have had the chicken avo...It comes with big pieces of bacon that cooked nice and cripsy but not fried to oblivion! The Chicken Club...also tasty and VERY filling. $5.79 The Cobb Salad wgich is a big portion with lots of goodies. No running out at the bottom of the plate.  Their fries are ok, crispy and a good sized portion but nothing special. The Fried Zuccini is wonderful. The 4 piece order is 4 huge spears of zuccini. Enough to share. they are coated in a corn meal batter that is light and crispy.  The place is clean and everyone that works there seams to be very helpful and friendly.  PS the cookies and cream shake is PERFECT!!!! ooooh now I am craving one ;)"}
{"text":"I had the French toast combo. French toast was tasty. Syrup hot, eggs are perfectly done bacon was delicious. For under seven bucks you can't beat it. Would have been about $12 at egg works across the street. Service was good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Foods great salads are bomb. Just heard of the place and been a few times already and plan to go more and more. Just the wait time is a little long when having to wait for lunch but worth the wait. They also do military discount. Great job guys and continue to do better"}
{"text":"Everyone has great customer service here , I have nothing to say about improving . It's just great and I appreciate them !"}
{"text":"I placed an order for four people, who had special requests for their food items. Such as Cheeseburger plain, Cheeseburger no onions and a burger BBQ sauce only. The only thing they got correct was a strawberry shake. The person working the cash register had communication challenges that made it difficult to understand what he was saying and clearly he had challenges understanding what I was saying. I enjoy Farmer Boys and have always received quality service and food. I would highly recommend if someone is going to work the register they can clearly communicate with the customer to insure quality service. We did not want to wait for the order to be redone, we got a refund and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh. We've had issues with our order before but was always fixed no issue at all. I haven't had anything that was bad yet, burgers are yummy. The all natural is really good. I'd rather have Farmer Boy's over In n Out anyday."}
{"text":"30 minutes in the drive thru for a soggy mess of a burger should call it the flop burger. This place is highly overrated if you order something in the Drive-Thru it's completely different than if you order it inside to eat these people are scum bags"}
{"text":"Great food but don't bother with a phone on order on Sunday June 8th.  Their phones are not working and CenturyLink won't be out until Monday per the manager after I drove on anyway thinking they might even be out if business.    Crazy to think how many To Go orders they're losing.  If I were the owner, CenturyLink would be out within and hour."}
{"text":"The best American burger spot there can be! It is a little pricey for fast food, but you definitely get your money's worth. Burgers, fries, salads, breakfast, and bowls are what is to get. Always clean and great customer service."}
{"text":"This food riye here is off the chain!! I make sure I come in with good appetite,  and ready to indulge in this farm fresh deluctibles. Those deductibles includes the double all natural cheese burger w/avocados bacon and the rest of trimmings that come w/it. Oh an not to mention , the very very friendly customer service's . Especially that GM ,"}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 15 times and at first it was an \"alright\" food place. Nothing spectacular but the food was decent. Recently I stopped going because I had an issue of them messing up my order so I just didn't go back for awhile. I returned for the first time in about 2 months today and it was such a bad idea. I went through drove thru and I ordered the 3 egg breakfast with eggs over easy, no meat, hasbrowns, and white toast. When I got home 5 minutes later I opened my food and saw that one of my eggs burst and was missing the yoke, my \"toast\" was just fresh bread dripping in butter, and my hash browns were crunchy. Out of all the times I've come here this is by far the worst experience I've had. I decided to try and eat it anyways. I tried a piece of \"toast\" and it was all soft and soggy with butter. And once I started eating my eggs I saw that some of the egg was raw and clear. And once I ate the hash browns they were crunchy because they were undercooked. Just all around a huge disappointment. I don't think I'll ever come here again after this whole situation, I just have never had a good experience here. Costumer service is average, but food is always poor."}
{"text":"We ordered the Farmer Burger and the Bell Ringer and a 7 piece onion ring and a chili bread bowl. We have never been to a Farmer Boys before so we just didn't know that was too much food for 2 people. At $25 for 2 people we were happy with the price. The food was great. Husband says he won't order chili bowl again because it's too much bread and not enough chili but the flavor was there. The burgers were good, I mean really good. The onion rings were HUGE and the best I've ever had. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH FARMER BOYS.  This is so good I am just going to give you a few high lights and say: GO THERE QUICKLY - YOU WILL LOVE IT.  Clean, Clean, Clean. Happy very friendly staff members. Quality products  Ridiculous amount of food.  We had a coupon for the Four piece fish dinner. Beautiful, fat, well coated, crispy, wild caught, white, Pollack Fish. Included salad or soup, fries, onion rings, and a roll. We opted for the lettuce, red cabbage, and tomato chopped salad with Italian dressing. We also had huge fresh cut  Zucchini sticks . To wash all this down we had very taste fresh made iced tea.  Two of these whopping meals with our coupon cost us a total of $19.44. Are you kidding me? We had to bring stuff home. There was just to much for us to eat everything.   We can't wait to try some of the other menu items. This may be our new dining   Anyone who likes fried fish needs to try this. Anyone who likes food needs to go there.  Right now there are two Farmer Boys in town that we are aware of: One on Eastern and one on Decatur. I'm told there are more coming."}
{"text":"Good big juicy burgers. They got sandwiches and even breakfast! No freezer so the beef is fresh like In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"They are trying to promote their chili. Double cheeseburger, chili cheese omelet etc. Sounds good right? Nah. Sorry we are out of chili. Poor management. How can you run out of a promotion? Too many choices here in town for me to go back."}
{"text":"As a yelp newbie I find myself compelled to only write reviews if I have experienced some sort of dissatisfaction with an establishment.  Rather than rant about a horrific episode that occurred last night at a neighborhood casino buffet (which I may still need to alert everyone about after I collect my thoughts) I would like to take this opportunity to spotlight the restaurant that is Farmer Boys.   Being a fast food connoisseur, Farmer Boys is somewhat of a hybrid restaurant.  You place your order at a counter (or via drive thru) yet you are served the food and you even get real utensils!  Again, being a picky eater I cannot comment on their fried zucchini, bowls of chili or fresh salad wrap however there burgers have always been approved by my taste buds and the onion rings are delish.  Also, fear not breakfast lovers you no longer have to go to Sonic or JITB to satisfy your craving to chow down on some breakfast munchies for lunch or dinner... this joint is rocking the sausage and bacon all day!  May I suggest their scrumptiously delicious breakfast burrito that comes with your choice of premium meat!   Please come out and give Farmer Boys a try.  Word to the wise it is a bit pricier than your average burger spot however, they do you have coupons in circulation and have daily specials that will save you $2-4 dollars!  Here is a link for current promotions: http://farmerboys-lasvegas.com/page.cfm?p=1coupons.cfm&CFID=16420536&CFTOKEN=56d06f707cf49ae1-E91EF539-5056-A32D-AD51D5B5B8B2C05E&jsessionid=84306dffd483b5cf4881533115744734372d Thank you for your time and I hope you take the opportunity to enjoy Farm Fresh Food served with a smile! PS- Farmer Boys if you are reading this please let me know the proper procedure for bussing tables in the dining room.  I always bus my table upon completion of my tasty meal however I am often bothered by the number of patrons who just leave their table in complete disarray.  I encourage you to promote the need for folks to clean up after themselves."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time at Farmer Boys. Simply put, the burger just wasn't very good. The girl that took my order was very nice and friendly.....she did everything right. But that weird sauce they put on the bun tasted like a combination of 1000 Island dressing, sriracha sauce, and dirt."}
{"text":"Was expecting a bit more. My chicken sandwhich was a thin piece of chicken, but I kinda liked it. But really, the food was average fast food at sit down restaurant prices."}
{"text":"The employees are very friendly and make it feel like a home cafe. Food is great, portions are big, and the price is fair! 90% of the menu is below $8.00"}
{"text":"Went threw the drive through and ordered. Lady was nice but I was surprised by the price. Got our food and pulled around and found they forgot the kids meal and chili cheese fries. Went inside and made them aware. I got the fingers and waited for the fries. When it became Apparent I wasn't getting them I left. Defiantly over priced and bad service. I know it's fast food but take a minute away from playing grab ass to help the customers."}
{"text":"The burgers here are bomb! The servers are very attentive and polite. Will definitely come back for the natural cheeseburger and chilly cheese fries!"}
{"text":"This place is really a great place if you truly like a burger that actually taste fresh and is fresh ... Yes it takes a bit to get your meal but thats because its FRESHLY made , this isnt mc donalds where your fake pre-heated me was ready since yesterday , dont complain about how long it takes ..if you like quality come here its about 10 bucks for a combo meal but the size of the burgers and amount of fries or onion rings is really a good size and fills my husband and I up and we can eat, I hate when a meal isnt enough to fill me up .. Burgers are really juicy ..if your into that cheap tasting big mac burgers then you probably won't appreciate a real burger to be honest so dont complain when you taste these real burgers."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place out and it was the worst Burger!! Meat was COLD, bread was Dry, my cheese wasn't even melted all the way until the very end. I had to Choke down the whole thing, I was hungry and on my lunch break... but it was actually horrible. I could appreciate the fresh produce: lettuce, tomato and pickle but the burger being cold and the bun being dry that was just hard to swallow down. Don't think I'll try Anything else from that place. Frustrating."}
{"text":"I don't get the attraction to this place.  I have been twice, and neither time did I think the food was worth the price.  The first time I had a hamburger and onion rings.  Burger was ok, but wasn't  a $7 burger, plus it was luke warm at best when I got it.  Did not care for coating on onion rings.  They too were luke warm.  Decided to give a try to something else on the menu the second time.  I ordered the turkey club, big mistake.  Garlic flavored bread and mayonnaise do not go together.  Ditch the garlic bread and use some good rye instead.  Also, replace the flavorless, pasteurized, processed cheese food, provolone slice for a real slice of swiss cheese.  The fries and the soda were the best thing about the meal, although, the fries could have stayed in the fryer a little longer.  Definitely not worth the almost $13 I spent.  I am skeptical about going back to try another menu item."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast a couple of times and burgers for lunch here and it the best of both.  There is no table service, but for the quality of the food and the price, I will be back. I have tried several burger joints in Vegas and this is the best so far."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had from a fast food establishment ever.  And the burgers actually look like they do in the pictures and not sloppily thrown together."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, great customer service, the price is just right for cook to order"}
{"text":"Ate here twice since it opened. First time I ordered a Farmer 3-egg omelet, it was good, I really like it better than IHOP. :) The place was packed so I went to sit outside, luckily though it wasnt that hot. The service was good, friendly staff, it took about 20 minutes for my order to arrive.   Second time was last week and I ordered the bell ringer (double cheeseburger). They said it's an award winning burger but I thought it was just ordinary nothing spectacular. I'll stick with in n out for the burgers much better. I got the combo so I paid about $11, I ordered the milkshake instead of the soda. Pretty pricey for a burger combo IMO.   the place was clean even the restroom, the food is just average so I'm giving it a 3 stars only."}
{"text":"Wow this one is nothing like the one on we go to , bun didnt taste fresh, fries were not good at all and ranch tasted like sour cream , burger was juicy but even there soda had no carbonation very disappointed ill stick to my favorite farmer boys never coming here again"}
{"text":"I got a salad and my husband got the burger (forget the name sorry) but it had a huge patty all the fixins guac and bacon on it, he LOVED IT."}
{"text":"Just drove through few minutes ago. As I placed my order, the woman working the drive thru kept cutting me off to ask \"IS THAT IT??\" The food was hastily thrown in the bag and barely survived the two minute ride down Decatur. To top it off, a third of my order was missing. I guess it's my fault for trusting them, but service here used to be so good. I'll eat somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"The food is sub-par at best. The hamburgers are very dry and overcooked, fries are mush and the onion rings have some kind of strange cornmeal coating on them that is very bland. The pricing is way out of line with the quality of food here, really you'd be better off at a regular fast food chain."}
{"text":"My burger was raw! Not medium, or slightly pink, raw! I know people make mistakes but serving anyone raw food is unforgivable. Never again! I will spread the word to ensure the safety of others."}
{"text":"It's ok and not worth the money. You're better off going somewhere else. There's nothing special about them. I got the avocado burger and the fries are bland."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in this area I need to give this place a try.  Usually have a burger but this time I was in the mood for breakfast at noon.  The Thursday special was a french toast platter with eggs, bacon or sausage and a 22 oz. drink for $6.  French toast was really good as were the sausage patties.  Eggs are eggs and you really have to try hard to mess those up.    Wish they would open up one on the NW part of town."}
{"text":"Not fond of this Farmers Boy, been disappointed with customer service twice now. Its not like it's really in a busy location like the others! Went through the drive thru around 7:15pm it wasn't busy at all. Ordered a Cobb salad and I wanted the soup bowl which they still didn't have, which I remember around this time last year they did! So I ordered a pastrami sandwich instead. I pull up to the window and pay, the employee said it would be just a few minutes. A little time goes by, then I see the guy with my order. Puts it in the bag and sets it near the drive thru window then walks off to the front cashier to take orders of people who walked in. Why didn't he hand it to me the moment he put it all in the bag? I was watched everything, like did he forget I was in the drive thru? But hey thanks for letting my sandwich sit there to get cold. Finally some other lady employee who returned from her smoke break 5 min ago had to hand me my order after it had been sitting there close to my 10 min. Its ridiculous to see what work ethic is these days and how quick people lose track of what they are doing even when it's not busy at all!! I won't ever return to this location again!! That was pathetic and irritating, wish the owner of that location knew how dumb their employees are."}
{"text":"My husband has been telling me about Farmer Boys for about a year. He tells me that they're out in Cali. I've never heard of them. Anyway, he decided to take me there because their burgers are supposed to be good or something. I think not. Maybe I was just really hungry and cranky. Oh wait, wouldn't that make the food taste better?!   You order at the counter and they give you a number to post at your table. When it's ready, they bring it out to you. I asked him to order a cheeseburger and fries for me. I figured I'd get something simple since these burgers are supposed to be good. As we're waiting I notice the jets that are painted on the ceiling. I guess it was a tribute to the AF base? In any case, it was a little out of place considering that the wall and decor were country themed.   Well, my burger comes out and under the bun is a whole mess of what looks like thousand island dressing. It wasn't a light smear.  It was a glob of it. Yuck! I managed to scrape it up and covered it with some ketchup and tabasco to mask any remains of the offending sauce. The burger itself didn't seem too bad but I think I was just turned off by the sauce. I have to say though, it wasn't the best burger I've had.  It's not even a mid-range burger for me. Would I do it again? Probably not."}
{"text":"First time going to a Farmer Boys after being told by numerous coworkers how amazing it is.  While the food was really good and the service was great, the price just seemed a little higher than what I was expecting.  I understand that this could be considered a sit-down style eatery but to me it comes off more as a hamburger joint with a diner appeal. I do like that they have other items on the menu besides just hamburgers and the food was very tasty.  The decor was a bit much, again, compared to what I was expecting. The location is also a bit stranded but I guess because of that there wasn't a line. So that's a plus.  All in all, I could see myself eating here again but I'd really have to be in the mood."}
{"text":"Started going to Farmer Boys in Cali and was excited to see a new one being built on Rainbow. Have been there three times now and have not been disappointed. I like the menu and the staff is great. Checking on us several times after we get our food to see if they can get us something we may want. We will continue to eat at this location."}
{"text":"Do not get any breakfast at the West. Charleston location. For what ever reason they let you order then it comes out 15 mins later without avocado & Cold.  Also do Not pre-order and do drive thru because we called ahead and still waited 10 mins at the window.  It's just weird and slow & cold food there. So for some reason there they just let your food sit out for a while. Not good."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed when I ordered food for me and my family and my burger was burnt. The fries were cold and the meat was dry and burnt. I couldn't eat it so I tossed my $6 burger in the garbage. My wife's wasn't as burnt as mine and she was starving so she drowned it in ketchup and got it down. We usually really like farmer boys but this one was not at all like any others. It just pisses me off that you pay $22 for fries and burgers and you can't even eat it."}
{"text":"Went to farmer boys for lunch not too impressed. Was expecting a hamburger you know 1/4 inch thick and juicy. What I got was a patty MAYBE 2mm and dry. The he BBQ sauce was the juicy part. Onion rings, 5 of them, were gigantic and undercooked and did not have a lot of flavor. This is one of those places that will be a tried it and move on category."}
{"text":"I got a salad that was \"ok\" being it was room temperature. My strawberry milkshake was finally made as I was walking out the door from dining in. The milkshake was like cold milk with chunks of strawberries in it. They had one girl working the register doing drive thru AND taking dining in orders at the same time. The place itself felt like the air conditioner went out and all they had was fans. I went At lunch time and there were tables with old breakfast plate still on them... a half of burger wAs on the floor as well and in the 40 Minutes I sat to eAt, no one cleaned up..... I must say, the cashier was amazing taking all the orders and the workers were nice and polite. This experience was definitely a reflection of POOR MANAGEMENT !"}
{"text":"I was starving and needed a quick bite. What a disappointment. Typically when someone is that hungry most things taste good.  This was terrible $10 burger combo bland burger smothered in sauce and cold fries. Even the ice tea was watered down so much it hardly tastes like tea! I would never go back."}
{"text":"This place was a joke. My husband and I went there for the first time to try it and was waiting for our food that never came. Every other person after us got their food but us. Management seemed like they had no idea what was going on. When we finally decided to leave one of the workers was surprised that we were leaving.  We got our money back and left.  Still no apologies or anything to offer us to come back and try it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times since this place opened. This is a fast-casual restaurant. You place your order, get a number, and the food is brought to your table. I can't say enough about what a good deal this place is. You could easily spend the same amount of money at a fast food place and not receive the quality of food or service that you do here.  The portions are big. The food is fresh and made-to-order. The food is served on glass plates with real silverware. The service is excellent and very attentive. If you order hot tea or coffee someone is always checking to see if you need a refill.  I've tried the omelet, breakfast bowl, and burger. They have all been delicious. I really like the giant zucchini spears and onion rings as a side option instead of french fries.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Staff was super sweet and friendly but extremely slow service. We waited 40 mins for eggs and toast. The food was ok but not worth the wait. Definitely quicker to go through drive through. Not impressed. Most likely won't be back. But again the waitress and greeting staff were really nice. The stars r really for them."}
{"text":"This place is okay the burgers are good and service is good. It is not the best food ever but a good alternative to the normal places. Lunch here is crazy be prepared for a little wait. Theyve got a BLT thats is good as well."}
{"text":"Food is good, wait in drive through long but (sign tells u it will be) Don't be impatient or good somewhere else, my only problem is i order milk & get charged $ but never receive it !  ( credited to account when called back, slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"ACTUAL IS ZERO STARS.  A month or so ago, the darling Orchid and I went back to the Farmer Boys for another pleasant experience.  Well ... not any more.  I ordered the same sandwich I always seem to order there, plus an order of hash browns (I discovered that I really liked their hash browns) and a fountain drink.  Orchid ordered pancakes with sugar-free syrup and no powdered sugar, a soda and a milk shake (partly because she had a raw throat, and the milk shake really soothes her throat, and partially because ... well who doesn't like milk shakes?).  She asked that the shake be brought as quickly as possible, for its therapeutic value.  Downhill from there.  My hash browns were WAY undercooked and dripping with whatever oil they use to prepare them.  A request for a re-make was met with, shall we say, less than a smile.  Orchid's pancakes came out ten minutes later, buried under powdered sugar and regular syrup.  A request to provide what we ordered was met with even less enthusiasm than my request for properly-done hash browns.  An inquiry as to the disposition of her milk shake had a member of staff bring out their kitchen ticket showing that no milk shake was ever ordered.  However, the kitchen ticket presented was for someone else's order.  After requesting to speak with the manager on duty, a young lady came out and spent several minutes apologizing, and then she wrote a \"comp\" for two meals on the back of our receipt.  Do you really think that after all this dog-and-pony show, including improperly prepared food, bits and pieces of our meals delivered in a haphazard fashion over a period of fifteen minutes, that I'm ever going to trust this outfit again?  Not bloody likely, as my English correspondents would say.  On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 10."}
{"text":"I have had some bad experiences with Farmer Boys up North, but I decided to give them another chance. Glad I did! Great customer service, great food, fresh, and fast at this location. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT fast food. I came here on my lunch break today. I ordered my food in the drive thru (which I thought was fast) at 12:05pm.  There were two cars ahead of me, after a few minutes,  to my horror another car pulled up behind me so I cant even back out now.  We were all \"parked\" for 10 minutes before we could finally pull up, only to park again, while they killed the cow evidently! I didn't make it to the window to pay, until 12:32!! I just kept on driving bc at this point I wasn't giving them 1 dime.  I will never be back to this location, from most of the reviews here they are EXTREMELY slow, it maybe ok to come here if you don't have any plans for the day."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, this has been a good place to eat but then I saw a recent review that the milk shakes were being premade. I thought no way I've seen them make them in front of me before but its been a while since I got one. I had lunch there today and sure enough the shakes were dated on the bottom of the cups. Mine was made 8 days ago!! Bad move guys I will no longer be ordering shakes here. Gets me thinking what else is being made this way."}
{"text":"I'm going to break my \"no-chain-reviews\" rule here, because despite only having two locations in the Vegas area, Farmer Boys is a pretty big chain in So Cal, especially in the OC/IE area. But it's new(ish) to Vegas, so... deal.  Farmer Boys had a unique place in my heart back home -- better than fast food, but not quite restaurant quality. It was the place you went to when you didn't really want to get gussied up for a restaurant (nobody REALLY likes to gussy, let's face it) but could go for something a little classier than Mickey D's. When I heard there was a new location relatively close to me, I was on it like Comet.  Now... I understand this location hasn't been open for all that long. But the service... well, is it so much to ask that my order not be interrupted three times because you messed up on the prior order? Then go running around for a pen because you don't have one readily available? I mean, seriously, that's about the extent of your interaction with servers, so don't mess it up.  As for the food, it's still a pretty good quality. I went for the chili and cheese omelette (Ryan's Rule for Yelp Dining: Everything can be made better with chili) and it was pretty good. I've had better, but I've certainly had worse. I apologize if I sound like a broken record... broken record... broken record... but again, it was not restaurant quality, but certainly better than an Anything McAnything. Though I didn't have one this time around, I remember the burgers being pretty tasty too; I'll have to get one next time.  So this Farmer Boys location takes up the mantle I left behind in Orange County: somewhere in between a fast-food place and a real restaurant. And that's okay... something's gotta fill that void, right?"}
{"text":"I do not have anything bad to say about my first time eating at Farmer Boys. I was greeted immediately when I walked in. The restaurant was clean and inviting. My order was taken quickly and I received it complete and correct. I was drawn to this restaurant after hearing about their natural burger and fresh ingredients. I do not usually frequent fast food burger places but I felt it was worth a try. The natural burger was by far the best burger I have ever had from a restaurant with a drive through. I also was very happy with the zucchini as an alternative to fries. It does take a bit longer than some other fast food restaurants but I understand you wait a bit more for freshness. Thank you Farmer Boys for a great burger."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and served amazing food. Drive thru a little long but otherwise fantastic service."}
{"text":"I got the avocado bacon burger, and my 3-year-old daughter got the hotcake lil farmer meal. The food was amazing, and I was blown away by the size of her meal. A big pancake, two eggs, and she doesn't like bacon (which I'm hoping is just a phase) so she got a huge sausage patty. It was only like $4.59 or something. And she couldn't even finish it.  My avocado bacon burger was delicious. I'm really picky about my burgers (they're my favorite food, but they're horribly unhealthy, so I only eat them occasionally. Nothing is worse than a crappy burger), which is why I don't usually order them unless I'm at a restaurant that specializes in them. This was awesome. Two huge, thick strips of bacon, a generous slice of cheese, and a surprising amount of avocado. A lot of places are stingy with their avocado, but this place puts a lot on there. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Burger was great. Shake is thick. Chicken hot and fresh. First time eating here. Will be back"}
{"text":"I LOVE  Farmer Boys but this location is the worse for burgers and anything fried! Pretty much every location gives incredible food and service but the one on Civic Center blows! Soggy zucchini sticks and undercooked burgers!  Get it together, this food isn't cheap so don't cook it like it is."}
{"text":"The love child of Denny's, IHOP and Fridays....kind of.  While the place is clean and casual, I can't really say anything great about the food.  I've had a charbroiled chicken salad here, and a few of the breakfast options.  Nothing was horrible, but nothing was good either.  Mushy eggs, toast drenched in butter, bland A-typical salad with packaged dressing (Kraft I think).   I love that the calorie content of each item is listed right on the menu, but honestly this should deter a lot of you from ordering some of the items.  Most of the wraps are 850+ calories, and for something that heavy, it better be good.....it isn't.  If you're in the area and pressed for time, this isn't a bad option for something relatively quick that's not fast food."}
{"text":"Still waiting for my Natural Burger after telling them twice. My party is done and ready to go. :( No real apology. Very disappointing when telling friends about the \"Best of Vegas.\""}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have breakfast  late after breakfast hours. We always get the pancakes with sausage plate or the breakfast burrito.  when it comes to fast food places like this I usually get disappointed  by not getting what I asked for or wrong order etc.. well this place is the exception  They are on top of their  food and service.   My favorite is the chilli fries with fresh onions , those are a must every time we come here along with zucchinis.  We just had their sandwich (hearty farmers club ) it's really good.  I'm so in love with their ranch but it's sad that every time I have to ask for one extra ranch , the container they give you is almost empty     I almost need like 4"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there yesterday because Red Robin was packed.  The pictures are nice, the food was not.  The meat had no flavor and the fries were average.  We have gotten by far better food at In & Out burgers for a lot less."}
{"text":"First timer. Ordered the Cobb salad and it did not disappoint! Generous portion, fresh and colorful ingredients, great taste. Plus the dressing provided is more than enough for one salad. All in all, simply based on the salad alone, I was more than satisfied and would gladly come back again (for another salad, haha)!"}
{"text":"A tasty burger stop on your way out of Las Vegas. Would go again."}
{"text":"Supposed to be farm fresh, etc... They have fried zucchini, and you can tell they do seem to be fresh large pieces of real zucchini, but half the time they are hard as a rock - way undercooked, and even if cooked correctly the breading is tasteless and really not good.  Onion rings probably have the same batter - fresh maybe, but not great.  Every time I have ordered a hamburger in the drive thru, it is at best lukewarm when I eat it...even if I eat it immediately in the car!  Never hot. Probably due to the long wait at the drive thru - I can picture my burger sitting there, getting colder and colder as I wait...Maybe inside is better - might try it sometime. One great thing is they serve breakfast all day, although it isn't as good as a real restaurant breakfast, it's not that bad. Last - the poor employees are forced to say this every time \"Welcome to Farmer Boys, How can I make your day?\"  Maybe by not saying that."}
{"text":"First time eating at Farmer Boys and I would say it was okay. I ordered the Patty Melt with a side of chili. The Party Melt wasn't bad. It was cheesy and nicely done. The fries were not bad either. The problem was the chili. It was cold and tasteless. No spice at all. My friend had the pastrami sandwich was also pretty good. Service was friendly and manager walked the restaurant to ask about the food. I still prefer Wendy's but I will give FB another try again."}
{"text":"I went back to redeem my free meal from the previous time and believe it or not they screwed up my wife's order twice.. She got a wrap and asked for no tomato or avocado and twice they brought it back with tomato. There's obviously some disconnect here, seems it should be easy, it even said on the receipt \"no tomato\" \"no avocado\"  needless to say we are done with this place.  The food is pretty good but too much of a headache for fast food."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going here, what a let down. Nothing special about the food here. The burger I would rate average at best and cold fries. Nothing special about this burger."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast! I wish there were more on the East Side!!!!!! Breakfast is bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm sitting in the drive thru.  I've been in drive thru now for 20 min, and I still have one car ahead of me!!   This same thing happened the last time I was here.  I thought it was maybe just a fluke the 1st time.  But now I'm convinced long drive thru wait times is the norm here.  I will never return again!!!!  This is ridiculous!!!  25 min in a drive thru for fast food!!  So finally got my food, and I will say it was yummy (sausage day break breakfast sandwich), but you can also get the same thing at other places in a fraction of the time)"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and waited from 9:20pm-9:40pm and no one came to check on us after we ordered our food . I had to go inside and remind them that we were still waiting in the drive thru for our food . Two cashiers and a cook just standing around , two customers sitting in the dining area already eating . No explanation was given to why we had to wait so long , my burger was soggy and cold and my husbands barbecue wrap was cold and falling apart , horrible service ."}
{"text":"Good Morning! Come here once in a while for their bacon breakfast burrito which is always oh so good.. With eggs,bacon potatoes and salsa this is a not too healthy way to start the day but it's definitely worth the extra carbs."}
{"text":"Excellent. Homestyle feel with fast food quality. Superb food and staff. Feels like you're in a restaurant back in the country, but fast food service.   A Must go visit for anyone."}
{"text":"If you're in no rush, hang out in the drive thru! They love to keep customers waiting for unnecessary amounts of time for a $10+ meal. Employees need better training or hire more competent staff that can multitask!"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys has always been one of my husband and my favorite places. He travels for work a lot and farmer boys is his favorite place to grub. We will NEVER visit this Farmer Boys EVER AGAIN. This is the second time we visit and something goes wrong. First time we ate there the meat was raw. We love this place so after a while we have this location a second try. Today we went drive thru and as I always do I checked everything I ordered was in the bag. Our onion rings were missing. Honest mistake I guess. We get home and they bag of fries looks like we got a small order. The bag wasn't even full. We pour them out and half of the fries are soggy and raw. Literally some were not cooked just dipped in oil. The other half were so soggy. I mean farmer Boys isn't a cheap meal. We don't mind paying for but not for this crap. This location needs serious intervention from the owner. completely disappointed long time customers!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I  tried the food  and I  must say it was very bland (the onion rings and the fried zucchini ). The meat should have been  seasoned. Not on list of places to return to. Suggest balance between being  fresh and taste..Too pricy for too little"}
{"text":"excellent food and good specials - it's just that the silverware is usually dirty and there have been flies in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros: Good burgers  Cons: Takes a while, service  Details: I have been to this location a few times and some other FBs as well. The best part is the food. Not really healthy (high calorie counts) but very tasty. This location seems to be slow at times. Also one of the times we came they messed up our order. Still a big step up from McDonalds for taste."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family. I had the sourdough sand which with fries and the zucchini. I can't complain everything was good. The ranch was also tasty.i will definitely come back to try additional things."}
{"text":"I went to the location on Lamb and Craig 3 times in a row on 3 different days and all three times they have messed up my order. I have been inconvenienced driving all the way home and just to realize that my order was incorrect. When I called and spoke to assistant store manager Keisha, she did not apologize at all and was very unhelpful. She gave me the information for what is suppose to be the GM Cindy. She offered to replace my burgers and also to make them a combo for the inconvenience she advised me to just tell them that my name was in the VIP book and I would be taken care of. Went to the location the very next day after speaking to Cindy GM and the assistant manager Keisha advised that she only had the burgers in the book and nothing else. She advised that she called Cindy the GM and she advised that she is only to replace the burgers. I want to know how do you have a GM that lies to the customers!!!!!! Well at least I know now why their customers service sucks it is because they are learning under a person that lies to the customers and could not give a S**t about customer service. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced and I encourage everyone to not do business with them. I know that I will never go to any of their locations again and will encourage everyone I know to do the same. Very upset customer!!!!!"}
{"text":"The location on Stephanie street in Las Vegas is terrible, it took at least 20 minutes of waiting in a drive through to get a salad and a cheeseburger, and couldn't be bothered to provide a simple apology.  This company should be ashamed at their quality of service, yet they are not, hopefully folks read these reviews and stop supporting this terrible organization.  They don't deserve your time or money."}
{"text":"Farm fresh to table. They really live up to what they say. We ordered their limited time offer only--Portabella Mushroom & Swiss burger combo. It was cheesy, juicy-licious! I had half and half for the sides I ordered for half crispy zucchini and half fries but when I got my order it was not half fries but half onion rings! It was a bummer and I don't wanna waste my time complaining so I just let it be. But hopefully next time she will get it right.  I love the Portabella mushroom & swiss burger! But the crispy zucchini were crispy but not tasty. It came with the ranch dressing though but without it to dip with, it was close to bland but it was okay for me coz at least they didn't put too much salt which would be bad in my opinion.   We also ordered 3-pc Fish and Fries. It was crispy and tasted fresh. Each serving was worth the price we paid for.   It will be better too if you download their app and become a VIF (Very Important Farmer). You earn a point for every dollar spent and when you earn 60 points you get a reward of $5 dollar off."}
{"text":"Really good.. Nice change from the average burger place.  Has wide variety from breakfast to sandwiches and burgers. For local and close eats this is where I go."}
{"text":"I go here a lot & the food is good. BUT the last couple of times I have went they have been been so busy that a simple sandwich & fries take 25 mins. Today the fries were so cold I asked them to remake them. So then of course I got undercooked fries covered in oil. This place is just going downhill to me. I get being busy but that doesn't mean the quality of your service or food goes down."}
{"text":"If you like a really slow disorganised restaurant then this is the place to go. Keep in mind they don't have weekday specials either. Been to this location a couple times and the service is horrible, I'm baffled how the manager keeps his job."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick meal with a co-worker. She swears by the breakfast at this place, but we were there for lunch. And I was not disappointed.  There is a fairly limited menu, but you can add and subtract ingredients, so there are lots of choices. I had the Natural burger, which was touted as being \"vegetarian-fed steer beef, hormone-free and antibiotic-free.\" It was a little pricier than my friend's cheeseburger, but to quote Sam Jackson from \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"this is a tasty burger.\" I added bacon and cheese, and ditched the 1,000 Island. Nice combo. And I loved the soft potato roll that it came on. So far, so good.  We didn't order sides because the burgers were filling enough. And I am not a fan of Pepsi products, so I tossed my Diet Pepsi and got an iced tea instead. But from what I had, this place is going to be on my short list for burgers. And from what my friend told me, it might be on my short list for breakfast as well.  And thank you, Farmer Boys, for listing the calorie counts on your menu board. Even though we all know a burger isn't the healthiest choice in the world, at least we can make a decision as to how much meaty goodness we want to ingest!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when I don't know where else to go. Quick staff with a smile as well as adequate time for the food to arrive. Tuna Melt is what I get everytime now, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Hotcakes are to die for Lol..also this place was packed with customers, which made me visit this location instead of my typical option (jack in the box)."}
{"text":"I love farmer boys! This place is my \"quick stop\" meal anytime anywhere. Farmer's burger on sourdough with extra avocados please!  My kids love this place. You get what you want in a reasonable time.  Perfect if you want to pick up food on the way to football practice.  Nothing fancy but I would definitely choose Farmer Boys over any other fast food chain. Food is freshly made. Who doesn't want fresh food? I could get a decent salad at a reasonable price. They need to be open 24/7 though. Come on, it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Waited for like 20 minutes and there was egg shell in my eggs() but the hash browns were good.."}
{"text":"First time to a Farmer Boy's and I was not disappointed.  I LOVE hamburgers, and their burgers are great!  Huge portions, so bring your appetite.  Oh, and the service at this location was great.  Pleasant, helpful, and everyone wearing a smile!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was extremely blah. I would have given 1 star but I gave 2 since my kids ate the fish and chips. Zucchini sticks are cut way too big. Each element of food needed salt. I ordered the patty melt and the onions were barely grilled.  I am never going back again."}
{"text":"This location is new so it's clean. Friendly service but food is so mediocre. The burger we got looks pretty sad and tasted worst than it looked. Reminds me of an elementary school lunch burger. Flavorless!  Breakfast was nothing to rave about either. Will likely not go back."}
{"text":"Can't complain.  Not my first time here . Good app. Good service. Great food. Always get the fish and fries. Even the Farmer's Burger is huge.  Puts the fast food chains to shame."}
{"text":"Ordered the barn burner burger.  Was a bit disappointed.  It definitely left me wanting something more.   Kind of dry and no pow which, by the name, I thought I would get.  Usually I enjoy the food here.  Today, not so much"}
{"text":"the hamburgers are so boooomb! the staff is always very nice and friendly and its just a nice place to eat a meal and relax :D"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there, ordered the $5.99 special they advertise on the window, they refused to honor it for the both of us, told us only one of the two of us could get the special, email their home office, have yet to get a response,, how silly is that only one person per 2 could get the special, so we left and went to have a nice breakfast somewhere else, I believe one Stars to many"}
{"text":"Good food.  But They don't care how cold it is in their buildings even if it's 115 out 60Â° is not a comfortable temperature to eat anything you have to eat your food fast otherwise it gets cold within minutes"}
{"text":"Want fast food with a restaurant experience and quality? This is the place. Not only everything is fresh to order but salads are served in a real bowl with actual silverware (not plastic). They bring the food to you so you don't have to wait around. Quality is as advertised and menu pretty varied. They're mostly famous for their breakfast and although I haven't tried theirs. I come mostly for the burger and salads, in particular their southwest salad with I got addicted to. Staff is always friendly and nice and even check on you from time to time to make sure everything is good. Prices are a bit steep for the salads but knowing you are eating fresh and healthy is always good. They also have daily specials (not at all locations) where you also get over $3 off a choice of two combos. If they did not close early (8:30pm) I would be making more stops after work..."}
{"text":"Just came back from eating here. I feel bad for giving two starts because the food was pretty okay. But I'm giving this for a reason.  We ordered the farmer burger, BLT, onion rings and a shake.  It was 20 bucks. I'm not someone who goes to expensive places a lot so to me this was A LOT.  When I got my hamburger it was HUGE. Which made me feel better about paying a lot. The BLT tho was tiny. My sister even got a bit mad.  The onion rings were good. I liked how they had ranch, jalapeÃ±os and ect things for people to get.  Well the hamburger was pretty good and too big for me to eat.  We didn't get our milkshake until like 20 minutes after our food. Did not like that.  The sandwich was okay.  The food overall was okay. Very filling BUT I don't think it was worth the price and their \"award wining\" Hamburger tasted like hundreds of other burgers I've eaten that were a lot cheaper. It was just normal food. Nothing I'd ever go back for.  The shake was my favorite of the things and the employes were REALLY nice and helpful.  But I don't believe I'll ever be going again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito I've ever had. I also love their French toast. I do wish that there were more locations in Los Angeles so I wouldn't have to drive too far out."}
{"text":"I love how this place is down the street from me.  It's a little on the expensive side if you only want something like a cheap combo from say a place like McDonald's.  I do have to say a lot of my 4 stars is based on the ambiance and service they provide.  I say ambiance because this place makes me feel very nostalgic and will usually remind me of being back home in the Inland Empire.  The service imho is outstanding with workers doing rounds picking up plates from you making sure you've enjoyed everything...     But a yelp review albeit based on service also has to be based on how good the food is.  I have gotta tell you this is by far my favorite burger.  The Farmer's burger has everything you want and then some.  Avocado + bacon = mouthgasm... and their zucchini are real good, but careful don't take 'em home they do tend to get soggy...     I give 'em 4 of 5 cause like many places that have transplanted themselves from other regions of the country, it makes me realize everything taste better where they're originally from.  This place is no different."}
{"text":"Farmers Brothers has great food great breakfast great burgers the fried zucchini not to be outdone by the finest restaurant in the Bellagio those zucchinis are delicious fresh piping-hot rated dip in that ranch dressing. If you haven't been you're missing out give them a try oh yeah they have fresh brewed tea"}
{"text":"Ehh, not impressed by this place.  I came here for the first time a few weeks ago.  I went to the drive thru and ordered a burger, a chicken sandwich, zucchini, onion rings, and a drink.  The staff was nice.  When the lady in the drive-thru repeated my order, it was all correct.  I received my order, parked, and checked it.  I didn't have the zucchini or onion rings.  So I go inside and ask for it.  One of the ladies apologized, saying that they had given me the wrong food.  They remade my food and I still didn't receive my onion rings.  I had received two orders of the zucchini.  The mistake was quickly fixed and I was given two free meals for next time, but I don't think I will be returning.  Mistakes happen, I'm not upset.  But I also wasn't really a fan of the food.  The best thing was the fried zucchini.  Those were actually really good, especially with their ranch!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the second time. Their club is delicious, but their fries and zucchini were bland. If you are trying to cut back on your salt, this is a great option because it doesn't seem like they put sale in the fried food.  Also had chili cheese fries with sauteed onions. It was very good. Check it out."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, and both times has been great, the food is freshly cooked to order and good quality ingredients, so fills you up for a long time,  The staff are friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes burgers or breakfast, the hotcakes are nice. the restrooms and restaurant are clean and well stocked up. Thank you"}
{"text":"Are here last nite it was really good.. They seemed short staff and were taking long on others food but ours took about 15 mins but we didn't mind it. But overall the guy in the front was nice."}
{"text":"Burger special was good, didn't pay extra to replace french fries for zucchini. Another day I ordered French Toast and that was delicious. Just a little pricey but overall it's good.. Friendly Service at this location.."}
{"text":"When I don't  want to go to a full service restaurant, but don't feel like fast food either I always go to Farmer boy's. Is the best of both worlds! Good food, good service, clean atmosphere at decent prices. They have great breakfast and excellent chicken wraps. I don't really eat hamburgers but they claim to make the best in the world. I'll I know is that they do make the best fried zucchinis! Go ahead give them a try. try the zucchinis, and if I'm right,  you owe me a star!"}
{"text":"I'll never be back again! Not my preferred burger place but I decided to give them a shot today. I sat in line for more than 25 minutes and there wasn't a lot of people there. Once at the window I still wasn't graded for at least five minutes and then I finally drove away. Waste of my time."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  The food is overpriced.  Four of us ordered and three sandwiches were brought to the table and everyone was almost done eating before i received mine...after i had to go tell them for the second time.  Onion rings were too thickly sliced and the coating was under spiced.  Definitely wont be going again...blech."}
{"text":"I love their huge salads here. All of their food taste really good. Never a bad piece of lettuce. The portions are huge compared to the price you pay. The only reason why I gave this place four stars is because their drive thru lane is so slow. Slowest drive thru lane I've ever been through. Ill definitely come back and continue to order my burgers/salads from here. Maybe this place was understaffed or super busy inside when I went thru the drive thru. But I'll give it another try next time."}
{"text":"My last three visits were terrible. Farmer Boys gave me the wrong order twice and food was cold. My last last visit i tried to call it in early and still had to wait thirty minutes on a burger. Between the ridiculous wait times and inaccurate orders i wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This is my very first time trying a burger from Farmer Boys and will be my last. I ordered a farmer's burger with ONLY lettuce, Tomato, and onion. No thousand island dressing, no avocado, and no pickles. Got my food, drove back to work.   When I got to work, I discovered that they put thousand island on it. No big deal. I brought it back to the restaurant, explained that the order was wrong, to which the gentleman at the counter kindly apologized and promptly brought me a new burger.  I checked that burger at the counter and at the time it seemed like the correct burger. I should have checked more thoroughly. When I got it back to work, I discovered that there was STILL avocado on it and also pickles.  I spoke to the manager (Stephanie I think) and explained my frustration. She immediately got defensive and said that if I didn't want avocado, I should have ordered a different burger. Really?! Would that have prevented them from failing the other parts of the order? NO. You should have made my order correctly from the get go.   I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty average to less than average. I got a bacon burger w fries. Was really nothing to it. In fact if u eat there u leave full and can not remember what u ate.. not bad.. not good.. just there"}
{"text":"Excellent service by a witty server named Alton  Made ordering fun. He was clever and personable. Lucky business to have excellent workers who are friendly, know how to smile, and are efficient!"}
{"text":"Went for the sandwiches and they were great! I normally don't get chicken sandwiches (hate dry chicken) but my wife gave their Sourdough Chicken Avocado Sandwich a try. I was completely blown away. The sourdough bread was golden brown with a generous amount of butter but still had its crisp, a nice helping of avocado, and the chicken was juicy and properly seasoned. I had the Farmer's burger and it was good as any burger I've had. Our server was Tristen and he was very helpful, patient, and very outgoing. He definitely made our visit here worth it besides the Sourdough Chicken Avocado Sandwich."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Farmer Boys before, so I decided to give it a try when it recently opened close to my house. I really like their clam chowder bread bowl! It's not comparable to the ones in San Francisco, but for the price (around $6-7), it's not bad at all. I haven't tried the other bread bowls, but will next time I make a visit there."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and it took over 10 minutes to get a cold burger. It's an expensive burger restaurant with horrible service and overpriced low quality meat. I always receive the coupons in the mail and now I know why they always end up in the trash.  I actually drove back to the restaurant with my half eaten cold burger and asked for a refund. I was starving and hadn't eaten anything all day. One would think this would make the burger exceptional. It only made me want to kill someone for the waste of my time. It looks good in pictures, but I'll stick to Five Guys Burgers and Fries or Smash Burger. The prices are about the same, but the service and product are 100x better."}
{"text":"As soon as i walked in i was greeted.  The cashier was patient as I figured out my order. I ordered the California BLT meal.  It was delicious.  Barbara was phenomenal helping me with my coffee to the table.  She also refilled my coffee twitter times.  She and the staff were very attentive.  Rang the bell out the door!  Thank you , I needed this type of service today."}
{"text":"I remember coming to Farmer Boys a few years ago and it tasted really good. The most memorable part were the fried zucchini they have. The uh \"healthier\" version of fries but still fried Lol.   Came here before the Superbowl because Bachi Burger was closed due to the Superbowl. This location was decently busy (few cars in the drive thru, few tables occupied in the dining room). Located on the SE corner of the first light you hit after coming off the 215 onto rainbow southbound, in a new mall with the newly opened Cafe Zupas (they close on Sundays apparently T_T)   Being a person who loves eating spicy, i opted for the Barn Burger which had a 1/4 lb beef patty topped with dill pickles, fiery farmer's sauce, pepper jack cheese, and fried jalapeno slices. Also changed my combo order to have a full side of fries, full side of fried zucchini, and strawberry milkshake. (yes im a piggy and this was the food im gonna eat before/during Superbowl, so sue me Lol)  When we got home, had the tv on and pre-game going. Ate the fried zucchini and fries first. I remembered the fried zucchini being better but not complaining much. It was still good. Crispy and flavorful. Batter isnt too thick (actually quite thin that it was falling off easily Lol). Left the burger for last. It was a decent burger. Jalepenos werent that spicy but overall was nice and flavorful.   Strawberry milkshake was... a strawberry milkshake. Strawberry-y and creamy but not too heavy. Wished i had a larger one actually despite the large amount of food i had. XD"}
{"text":"Came here for some breakfast and lunch with my family  My mom ordered the fish and chips. Fish was excellent and crispy.. too bad I can't say the same for fries. Fries were soggy and lifeless  My dad ordered the California omelette. It was pretty good but there were no big bacon chunks. All the bacon was bacon bit sized. Avocado was great  Brother ordered the country fried chicken with gravy breakfast bowl. This was excellent. Great portion, hash browns on the bottom and plentiful amounts of chicken and gravy  I ordered the Cobb salad which was fresh and great! No complaints!  The only issue we had was we waited about 20-25 minutes for our order(we ordered to-go). Finally went to ask where our order was and it turns out it was sitting, bagged and ready to go for about 10 minutes"}
{"text":"First time I tried it while I was on vacay in Las Vegas and it was great! The burger was good and the zucchini fries were awesome! I will def go back!"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Very clean and great service. Willie was very courteous and made sure we had everything we needed. The food was good as always, but what stood out even more was the excellent customer service from Willie. He checked on us at least 3-4 times. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Farmer burger had everything I like in a burger but it didn't really stand out the way I hoped."}
{"text":"Since our first visit when this location first opened until now we've visited you several times the staff is getting less and less friendly and cleaning the hoods over the grill during hours of operation to me is unacceptable"}
{"text":"So the time days closes at 10 As well as the other locations. So don't bother coming at 9pm because that's when they stop taking orders HAHA"}
{"text":"Got there an hour before they closed. Was treated like they were about to close in 10 minutes got cold food smashed Burger uncooked fries. The guy mopping the floor pretty much closed off everything but three tables and cleaned all the trash cans out. Was kind of rude when went to go throw away the trash all around just a really bad experience"}
{"text":"Thought I would give them one last try. Ordered chili cheese fries... waited 25 mins and people after me got full meals and got the stuff before me. The managers kept walking by me not saying anything. Not happy with there service once and for all. I should have learned the first time I went. They totally suck at speed and everything."}
{"text":"This place has had its ups and downs with me our first visit my husbands fried fish platter had so much grease he had to get something else my cobb salad was good our second visit went well the natual burger and cobb salad was good the next visit there was a long hair in my salad i got the manager she first looked at my hair like it was my hair even though it was under most of the salad then she tried to tell me of some study that said hair floats through and air and thats how it gets into food i was unable to find the study she did offer me another salad i declined she refunded my mony and gave me 2  5.00 off coupons so i feel they redeemed the place i dined there today with my husband my food was good but my husband who asked for his natural guac n bacon burger to be cut in half looked mangled and lacked flavor so with this place u never know how the food is going to be"}
{"text":"Great food!  Fresh and tasty.  While I did have to wait for a little bit, that just went to show me that my food was made fresh to order.  I had a burger and chili cheese fries.  They were excellent.  I plan on returning to try other items out."}
{"text":"Shakira gives horrible customer service at the drive thru. Not recommended.... I asked if they still give discounts to school district employees and she literally said, \"I don't think so.\" I had to ask her to check. She told me that didn't but instead recommended that I lie and say I'm a senior citizen because they get good discounts. I'm in my late 20s by the way. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me. I drive by it every day from work, read the reviews, and thought I'd give it a try.  The venue itself is half like a fast food joint, and half a restaurant. I decided to eat in, and the first thing I noticed was the menu. They offered so much stuff, from sandwiches, breakfast items, and salads, to burgers. I eventually decided to go for the breakfast platter since it was what hooked me into trying the place out in the first place and my companion ordered the farmer burger.  We picked out a table, and they brought out our food. Everything was hot and delicious. The breakfast looked like it was cooked fresh, not microwaved, and the burger was huge. Taste wise, I've had better, but you get what you pay for, and for a quick fix, this was place to go.  At about eight bucks a meal, including drinks, their price specials, lots of food choices, and great atmosphere, I gave this place 3 stars. Taste, quality of food and number of locations are the cons."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was surprisingly happy eating at Farmer Boys! It was one of those days where I needed a quick bite while I was out running errands.  I ordered the grilled turkey sandwich with a side salad and pancakes ($1-2 add on)!  The sandwich tasted great! Everything was pretty good!  I went through the drive thru which was a decent experience. They even gave me a couple extra sides of ranch dressing without any issue...and the ranch was freshly made instead of packaged! Farm fresh fast food!"}
{"text":"My new favorite vegas burger! liked it more than in n out. Eat inside because the place is cute and you shouldn't rush the cooks."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, a little above average. But it is way too expensive to eat there.  I don't care if its fresh!  Save your money."}
{"text":"Was curious of trying this place after seeing the reviews and commercials about how good there burgers and food are. So I decided to try them for the first time the customer service is decent and overall the food is good for what it is the burgers are good not great but I really loved the chili cheese fries they were the bomb and I'm looking forward to getting those again. Final analysis this place is good the prices are decent and the customer service is good the chili cheese fries are good and the burgers are decent I see myself coming back and making a trip here to try another item but I'm still getting the chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Always a fan of the Natural Avocado Bacon Burger. It's huge, and even though it's fast food, the burgers are always made to order. The order taker could literally ask you to speak up whenever you get to the speaker box, and you could always hear the background activity when you get to the window. Always amused. I wouldn't use the drive-thru if you're ordering for a group though 'cause you would hold up anyone else behind you.  The shakes are addictive, and my family's fave is the Cookies & Cream or Strawberry.  We've also had their Crispy Zucchini. Those things are huge, so I wouldn't order more than 4 pieces for 2 people. I wouldn't recommend eating it as leftovers either 'cause the breading will get soggy after reheat."}
{"text":"I love farmer boys!!! Okay... Not in that way.... But the food is actually very good. In a rush? Want fresh fast food? Farmer Boys is a great option for those seeking budget and fast gourmet. But, don't get your hopes up, there are only three locations in the valley so not matter what, you will probably have to make a lengthy drive. I promise it is worth it though. I had breakfast last time which was greasy, but a great start to my day and served fresh on a glass plate. You do not get that often at an establishment with a drive through. This time I ordered the \"big cheese\". This is a single cheese burger with all usual toppings and an addition of there own sauce ( much like in n outs). The burger was great on a sesame seed bun, it held together nicely with that perfect amount of \"good sandwich\" drip. The patty is good however I prefer mine with more seasoning, however, this will not dock it any points since we are still in the fast food category. The kitchen was full of workers, ready to serve you. And yes, they did check up on us at the table, more than once. So in a scoop, it's worth giving a try. Substitute your frys for their huge fried zucchini logs, they are prestige."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last couple of weeks and each time did not disappoint. The staff was courteous and very polite. The food was plentiful. Come hungry because you will get full quick since they give you a lot. The zucchini is out of this world. The fries are real fries and not greasy. The burgers are WOW!!  I highly recommend the Barn Burger. Has a kick to it but not overly spicy. Try the shakes!!    This was an A+ for us both times"}
{"text":"Our first visit here, upon hearing a good review from a friend    The food might be good, but very difficult to enjoy because of the atmosphere.  Is it a hiring requirement to be LOUD?  My goodness, the voice level of the employees was intolerable, both the counter worker and the drive through worker. He definitely did not need his speaker mic, I'm sure the customers across the street st Cane's heard him very well. And the counter employee made me jump as she came around offering coffee.  Is there really a need for this loudness?  Not enjoyable, at all.  Oh, and no lights were working in the dining area."}
{"text":"Love the food but the drive thru is so slow. I hope they get it up to speed soon. Employees are great."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service great. Will be going back to have one of their salads and try the fish meal."}
{"text":"Horrible. It wasn't busy and our food took nearly 30 minutes. Upon receiving our food, it was cold and obviously sitting out for some time. When bringing it to their attention, the staff want polite or apologetic. We requested a refund and left to never return there again."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service at this location is lousy. There was only one cashier open with 10 people in line during rush hour for lunch! Didn't look like the drive thru was faring any better it was backed up half way around the building. The food took forever to get too. This location is obviously under staffed."}
{"text":"My family and I went on October 16th for the first time. I was very disappointed.   I ordered the avocado bacon cheeseburger, onion rings and zucchini sticks. Got home and my burger had no lettuce and tomato on it. The meat had no seasoning at all. I didn't know I had to ask for it to be put on my burger. Other than that I did like the avocado bacon sauce. The plus is that I didn't feel heavy and sluggish after eating the meat.  The onion rings were not fresh, they didn't even taste like onion. There was no sweetness to the onion and the batter wasn't seasoned at all. They looked good but that was it. The ranch dressing was very good.   The same regarding the zucchini sticks, the batter and no seasoning. Maybe th he zucchini should be cut into chips instead of sticks and add seasoning to the batter.  My family as well as myself was very disappointed and after eating the food, we were not satisfied at all. It didn't satisfy my craving at all for a good hamburger. It was my idea to try this place because I read they use grass fed beef. I don't know if it was just this location, the cooks, or what. But it wasn't good. We want be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. They cook everything made to order.   California Omelet is great! Fried Zucchini is one of my favorite things! So glad they opened one in Centennial Hills!"}
{"text":"i was just driving by to my hotel and one of my friends spotted this place on the side of the road so we went and tested it out i didnt get fries but my buddy said it was a terrible choice and wishes he got fried zuchini instead which was outstanding by the way it was so good i had the farmers omelete it was so good and the hash browns were so good i had way to much food def had the itis afterwards and passed out food was delicious though"}
{"text":"Of fast food joints farmer boys is a solid go to for me.  I believe it's more natural than crap at mcdonalds but in the end it's still fast food.  If you're running out of time and want a breakfast try the Breakfast burrito.  Holy moly this thing is solid.    Other than that some cool noteable things is that they have huge fried zucchini.   I get a little tired of fries all the time so i thought this was an interesting switch up."}
{"text":"This place sucked!  Non of our food came out the way it looked in the pictures. the brick this is very disgusting french toast was soggy, eggs were really runny and I ordered them scrambled, bacon was extra crispy as if it was microwaved too long.  Overall, the only good thing about the place was that its spacious and the soda is good. The service was horrible and the cashier had a bad attitude like she was mad that she had to work today or something.  Probably will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming to this location! I'm very disappointed and the burgers are so expensive. Restaurant itself is dirty, workers are lazy, and poor customer service. Don't get the cheese fries because they serve the cheese not melted on the fries. I'd rather have you spend your money at in n out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, love the quality of the meat, got the 1/2 fries and zucchini, restaurant is clean as well as the bathrooms, good prices, definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I usually order the fish fry and zucchini fries. Normally it's pretty good however, this last time I ordered the fish it was very mushy so you can tell the fish was old. It was not flaky at all. The batter for the zucchini fries did not stick. The zucchini fries were too thick in my opinion. They should cut them and thinner strips. The batter did not stick to the onion rings. Everything was mushy and fell off. I just ended up throwing it all out. It was really gross. Next time I will just be sure to check it before I leave. My kids get the grilled cheese sandwich and fruit plate. If you go to the drive-through it takes a little longer but it's only because they make it to order."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in over the weekend to grab a quick bite. The food was very disappointing as was the service. My mom ordered a burger and on the menu it looks like a nice thick patty but it was super thin and not cooked all the way through. I ordered my sandwich without bacon and it was served with bacon on it. The dining area was a mess. The nicest thing I can say was that a nice man who was also a patron helped show me how to use the soda fountain for plain water as it was marked in several areas but was all soda water. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here today and ordered a barn burger with crispy zucchini.  The burger was luke warm and seemed like it was sitting there for a while.  The cheese was not melted.  Towards the end, I could not eat the burger.  The zucchini was hot and fresh but there was no seasoning on it and it tasted very bland.  The onion rings were freshly fried but had the same bland batter.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  The food came out fast and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"The burgers are good. The fries aren't bad. The ranch dressing is good. I haven't tried anything else. The Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger combo is my go-to. Since there's a drive thru you'd assume it's fast food. It's better than fast food, in terms of quality, but worse in terms of speed.  Tonight, they forgot to put avocado, and I didn't realize until I got back home (That wasn't the first time they forgot something. A previous time, they forgot to give my soda). I went back to exchange the sandwich for a new one. They obliged, and also added fresh fries and extra ranch, which was pretty redeeming. Unfortunately I left my receipt behind so I wasn't able to use the printed barcode to get credit on Farmer Boy's loyalty club app."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely nice, but the cooks can't seem to get our order right.  We ask for well done toast and we always get warm bread. We ask for over easy eggs and we get raw eggs."}
{"text":"Went to Farmer Boys on a recommendation of a co-worker who always goes to the Decatur location. Since the Rainbow location had just opened (2 weeks prior to my going there) decided to give it a try since it was closer to my work & I also had to run another errand that was close to the Rainbow location. I had high hopes for this place as my co-worker talks it up quite a bit but unfortunately they fell flat on their face. I do not understand how they can be 4.5 stars with 16 reviews.   Went in around 12:20pm on a Friday. There was a little bit of a wait which I understand & was OK with that since it was lunch time & a Friday. They do not have good system for moving people to to the registers in my opinion. As we waited our turn to be called to the next register some customer that came in after us barges in front of us going to what would have been our register. There's not a large enough area in front of the counter before the 1/2 wall that separates the tables to have lines of people waiting at each register so that's why we as well as others were waiting at the last register to be called up to the next available register. Luckily the last register next to the drive thru opened & the cashier came out to get us & we did get to order before the jerk that budged in front of us & others. My lunch mate ordered her food & all was fine. I then placed my order & tried to pay for my order with my Amex card (I get airline miles for every penny I spend.) My card was declined & I knew it was OK as I had just used it @ Sam's Club for gas that morning. Since it had the chip in it I asked the cashier to key it in manually. She looked @ me like I was speaking Greek. She finally figured out how to do it & still declined. Then she got a mgr & apparently the corporate store has not set them up yet with their Amex card so customers cannot pay with Amex. Seriously? You're a chain business that's been in business for at least 2 weeks (according to what Yelp says as I write this). I could give a little wiggle room if it was a mom & pop place that didn't have it set up but a chain restaurant that has 6 other locations in the valley? Anyway I used a different card & payment was accepted. After our orders were placed (@ 12:32pm as our ticket indicated) we headed off to a table & waited for them to bring our orders out. We sat & watched as diners that came in after us & ordered after us received their food. Finally @ 12:51pm we stopped one of the cashiers that was delivering food & asked him what was taking so long & just then the cashier that actually took our order came by with food but it was not our order. By then we were getting irritated since we were hungry & were on a time limit to get back to the office. All the cashier could do was say \"I'm sorry.\" & she took our receipts. After a couple of minutes she returned telling us that the workers in the back never had our order up so they never made it. My lunch mate was angry as it had been over 25 minutes from the time we ordered food at this point. We got the manager & asked what was taking so long & he told us that the workers in the back were too nervous & making mistakes because the \"big boss\" was back there watching over their shoulders. I am sorry but if your workers are that incompetent to work with someone watching you need new workers. Finally after about 28 minutes my burger (Farmer Burger) came out with it's french fries & 2 large onion rings. I immediately had a french fry & they were soggy & cold. My lunch mates food was still not at the table & she had ordered before me & finally she received her cheese burger. I then asked the cashier for new fries as mine were soggy & cold. She did oblige & brought me out a new order on a separate plate as I told her I need to eat my burger so I could get back to work. The new fries were hot at least but no flavor what-so-ever. The onion rings also had no flavor in the batter on them. I did like that they were not greasy. They would have been awesome had they had some seasoning in the batter. The Farmer Burger had now flavor either. And the bun was dried out & the bottom bun was tore so my burger fell apart as I tried to eat it. I ended up just using the large piece of lettuce as the bottom bun after the bottom bun had fallen apart. The manager had taken our receipts to get the order #'s from them & we asked for compensation as it took 25+ minutes to get a burger. It should not take 25 minutes to get a burger especially in a place that specializes in burgers. The manager did comp us each a free meal for the next time we come in. At one point before he had decided to give us a free meal ticket I had told him I wouldn't be coming back based on the experience today so I think that's why he decided to give us the free meal ticket. This was the 1st time I have ever been to a Farmer Boys & quite honestly I will not be going back. Maybe just to use the free meal ticket but we'll see about that."}
{"text":"This place is fire the portables mushroom bury her was  amazing. When my food was brought the guy that brought said ohh the snubbed you on the fries and immediately brought out more I wouldn't have even noticed but it was clear to see he wanted to ensure we enjoyed the meal all in all the food was awesome and the service was great"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the service is always awesome! :) Food is delicious and zucchini fries is a MUST!  There's nothing to complain about. Maybe if it's busy and you need to use the bathroom and have to wait for someone behind the counter to press the button but that's not a deal breaker for coming here."}
{"text":"So a representative from Farmer Boys read my review and sent me coupons to try their restaurant again. They sent me an email and letter apologizing for their lack of service. I appreciated the acknowledgement and thankful that they were willing to take responsibility rather than make excuses. I returned to the same location and the food was still outstanding, got to try the onion rings and zucchini. They restored my trust with the follow-up and customer service. Thus the increase in the rating. We will see as I will be visiting the same location a few more times. Will update later."}
{"text":"This was the best fast food stop we made in Vegas.  Well, I guess this would be more of a \"fast-casual\" place.  You order up front, then someone brings the food to your table, and the place is more nicely decorated inside.    \"The Natural\" burger uses antibiotic-free meat.  Normally, a \"healthier\" place that tries to make a burger will screw it all up - there is a place in DC that tried it and the burgers tasted like wood shavings.  Not here, \"The Natural\" was a great fast-food burger.    Prices are a little higher on the fast-food scale but you pay more for higher quality ingredients.  Would definitely visit again, hopefully they expand East."}
{"text":"I waited for over 40 minutes from the time I started to wait in the drive through. There was only one other car ahead of me. It took twenty minutes from the time I placed my order to receive my order. The order only contained three meals, two of which were only chicken strips. There was no explanation or apology from the staff nor thanking me for my business. I am very dissatisfied with my experience and will never return!"}
{"text":"Never broken the morning fast at a Farmer Boys.  Given the relatively close proximity between my occasional breakfast buddies, this seemed an acceptable choice to try since it had just opened up.  I have been to FB's at several locations around the valley and have found them to be at the very minimum a solid four star experience.  That was with lunch.  Breakfast is another story.  I found it to be rather bland and even with gravy...none satisfying.  Lunch is far superior.  I slowly consumed a breakfast burrito with sausage, and a side order of biscuits and gravy.   The one thing which stood out was the quality of service from the employees.  All were for the most part friendly, but all were attentive in filling up coffee cups as you hung out in the morning hour.  I will wait until the hype subsides before I visit for lunch and then evaluate then.    The service prevents this from being a two star experience."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try since I saw it is now open. Initially I was going to order a burger until I saw they had pastrami on the menu. I was thrown by the prices a bit. For a fast food place it all seemed a bit overpriced. I had a pastrami sandwich that cost almost $8 for just the sandwich. No fries or drink because that would have been almost $12. Now the sandwich had mustard, pickles, cheese and was on garlic ciabatta bread. I liked the flavor of the meat it was tender and the other stuff on the sandwich all meshed well together. For 2 people to eat complete meals here it can run around $25 which is too pricey for a drive thru joint. I did find on their website though how you can sign up for deals and they had printable coupons posted for really good deals on meals that include a drink. I will come back with coupons because I did like the sandwich but I'd never pay regular price."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. We had no idea where to get breakfast and simply selected the first place with decent reviews. It was a fast food restaurant for sure but the food selection was varied with selections for everyone.   When are you coming east???"}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with this place. It's like a Denny's but has a drive through. The service was good and the breakfast omelet was too. I'm sure I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming in and it reminds me of Fizzoli's (the fast food pasta joint).  It is a pretty cool concept, but it seems a bit pricey.  I had the Farmer's Boy Burger - 1/2 pound of beef, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Pickles, cheese and Guacamole.  The combo comes with a drink and your choice of Frys, Onion Rings,  Zucchini or half and half.  The food was good.  I was disappointed with the burger patties.  This particular burger comes with two and they were pretty flat and over cooked.  The best value seems to be the salads.  My daughter had the Harvest salad and it was pretty large; healthy too.  It comes with Chicken, Apples, Walnuts, Raisins and grapes.  There was no end in sight and the combo (includes drink makes it a good value.  The staff is friendly and the place was packed.  I don't think this will be a regular stop for me, but it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Went there recently with the fam. Wifey and I both ordered their burger called \"The Natural\". We both got the combo meal. The burger itself is good sized but that's about it. Comes with cheese and onions. The onions are raw and for me that was a turn off. How hard would it be to grill them? Then their sauce is just thousand island's dressing. With my order I got a 4 piece of fried Zucchini. Im not exaggerating when I say these are freakin' huge. Ordering the 7 piece is a waste. I could only eat 2 anyway. My wife got the onion rings and once again huge! The zucchini and onion rings were just ok. Plus this place isn't cheap. If you compared this place with say in and out or Freddies this place loses hands down. I could make a much tastier burger at home and I have. But I'd your hungry and happen to be near one I guess their ok. But only if you have no other options."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see a farmer brothers single right down the street from my house unfortunately my expectations musta been way too high the food  was not very fresh the service was also lacking I have heard great things about this restaurant so I'm not going to give you a bad start but this review is not a good review I'm coming in next week hopefully it'll be a lot better"}
{"text":"So I get a message asking me to come back and try it again. I think yeah, I should. I go back with friends, we order food. I get the same thing I ordered last time - barn burner add avocado. I pay for the avocado, but it's not on my burger. I feel like a weirdo for complaining about such a small thing but it happens too much - and the guy the first time was so rude."}
{"text":"We decided to give them a try, but will not be coming back. It took 30 minutes to get our order. This wouldn't have been a huge issue, except multiple families that ordered after us were finished eating before we even got our food. When the food arrived, it wasn't cooked well. The hash browns were under cooked and the toast was burnt. All of the employees seemed very friendly, but decent, timely food is important."}
{"text":"Trying something new while visiting and I couldn't decide on breakfast or lunch and they had both so I got both... food was good total was 27.12 drinks were not included with breakfast combo (?)...hubby got French toast breakfast with sausage and eggs tell them well done sausage or you just might have it a lil raw I had pancakes breakfast with bacon mine was fine then we split a double cheeseburger (yeah we greedy) and we didn't finish our breakfast LOL the burger was delicious...I think if I was to ever come back I would get that instead unless I had a taste for breakfast...one Star for the sausage but give it try!!!"}
{"text":"Love farmer boys!  Best kept secret in the valley.  Food is always good and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's cheap and the food is good. Working crazy hours it's nice to be able to get breakfast at dinner time. The staff is also very nice and welcoming. Me and my guys have eaten here at least a half a dozen times and have yet to have a bad experience."}
{"text":"PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE CALORIES!  A great place to visit when you are seeking a tasty burger.  Friendly service...never had a negative experience and the employees are all smiles and full of chit chat.  My personal favorite is the Bacon Avocado Burger. I don't know if the avo is fresh but everything tastes and looks like it is like it is.  I have tried the zucchini and I have had the onion rings, both a rather large and delicious compliment to your meal."}
{"text":"I had the California omelette. I would compare them to a pricey McDonald's. Except McDonald's does not carry omelettes. There wasn't really anything special about this particular place. The omelette's eggs were cooked hard. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"A nice comfortable place to enjoy a burger especially when that burger is a delicious Farmer Burger. The FB was a 1/2 lbs patty with double cheese, bacon and avocado.  For go the fries and give the zucchini sticks a shot instead.  Then enjoy in the comfort of this easy going fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"When I went to this place for breakfast, I was not sure what to expect.   But when I went to Farmer Boys, I did not have a good experience.  As soon as I walked in, the place seemed clean so I had high hopes.  They were NOT prepared for anything.   As soon as I sat down, there were no place settings!  There was no creamer for my coffee either.  I had to ask him twice to get my creamer in fact.  Also, there was nothing to identify my coffee as decaf!  So, what happens?  A lady comes by and topped off my coffee with caffeinated!   I had my mixture perfect to begin with.  I had the cream, sugar and coffee just right.  Then what happens?  The lady messed up the mix and to add insult to injury, she did so with the wrong kind of coffee!  After this, the coffee just didn't taste good.  After a LONG wait, the food finally came out.  By the time it came out, I still didn't have any silverware to eat the food with.  So, I find out that none of their silverware was even washed.  So, they had to run some silverware through the dishwasher and then bring me a fork to eat my food with.  By this time my food was COLD.  Granted, this was 8am.  You would think they would be prepared.  All I needed was a fork.  When I finished eating my cold food and arguing with the lady to stop refilling my coffee I had to use the rest room.  There was no toilet paper and there were no paper towels either.  I paid for my meal and left.  I will never return to this restaurant as it was a complete disaster!"}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes this place is a step above the rest. The food tastes good and is made to order. Just be prepared to wait since it's all made fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while I was waiting for a windshield installation down the street at Safelight (after a recommendation from Rick at SL).  We had: Country Fried Chicken Bowl: I got the gravy on the side. The bowl was built simply with hash browns, eggs, and a fried chicken patty. The chicken was definitely more succulent than it appeared and overall, I was very satisfied with my meal. Farmer Bowl (I think that's what it's called): this comes with peppers, zucchini, ham, sausage, bacon, hash brown potatoes, eggs and cheese. I didn't try this dish, but it looked good. If only it came with toast, or we had thought to order an extra side of toast.. Hmm.. Hot Chocolate: ordinary, but what's wrong with ordinary? I enjoyed it.  For around $18 (before the discount), we had 2 complete breakfasts. I'd say it's a pretty good deal if you're in a pinch and don't have time for a full service breakfast place. We both decided that we'd prefer the Cracked Egg, but this place is right around the corner, service is quick, and the price is right.   I'm definitely planning on coming back to try the burgers, but kind of expect them to be a disappointment.. but until then- I was very happy with breakfast and would go back in a heartbeat.  20% off $10+ when you redeem your check in offer!"}
{"text":"Had the 3 eggs breakfast and bacon, and I had to get the zucchini fries that I saw all over Yelp. Well the portion was HUGE!! Both eggs and bacon platter and the zucchini. I went through the drive thru, pretty fast. Total price came out to be $13.17 but there was so much food that I had enough for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent California BLT! I asked if the smashed avocado that came on it was plain avocado or guacamole. She didn't really answer my question but she said I could get it with sliced avocado so that's what I did & it was great. The bread is like a grilled sourdough, the bacon was crispy but not burnt, the mayo was perfect & everything was evenly spread out. For your side you have a choice of fries, onion rings or fried zucchini or you can choose 2 for no additional charge. I got the fries & onion rings. It was a large serving. The fries could have been crispier. The onion rings are fat w/a cornmeal coating. Both were better when I heated the leftovers up in my toaster oven the next day. They were generous with the ranch dressing & service was fast & friendly! I'll definitely stop by for a BLT whenever I'm in the area. They are also open until midnight which is nice!"}
{"text":"Went outside my comfort zone and tried the wild  caught Alaskan pollock wrap today....pleasantly surprised Delish! Portion size was great! I would suggest find a coupon before you go! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Vegan options at fast food restaurants are scarce, if existent at all, so when I found out online that their garden burger was vegan I was intrigued.   Just as a precaution, when ordering, I asked the young man taking my order if this veggie burger was in fact egg and dairy free, to which he didn't know but he promptly asked a manager, who went in the back to read the ingredients for me with no hesitation! How cool is that? Sometimes I get the most sour reactions when I ask questions like that but these employees seemed to actually care about my inquiry and wanted to give me an honest response. Kudos farmer boys!   I got the veggie burger and it was delicious! Even my meat eater boyfriend thought it was tasty. Boyfriend also loved his food, but he always loves his food from farmer boys.   Environment is inviting and clean, service was excellent (I mean they actually bring your food to you and take your plates when you're done!!) food came out quick (but not too quick you know?)   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to this restaurant. The owner or manager was extremely rude. I went in there not knowing that the coupon I had was not valid for this location. When I told the owner/manager that I didn't want the food because I didn't have enough money to pay he told me I made a mistake and I needed to pay for my mistake. I politely told him I can't and that I was really sorry. I proceed to leave when he yelled out the drive thru window \"B***H\" when I stopped the car because I was surprised he stated \"Yes I am talking talking to you \"B***H\". I left immediately. I will never go to a Farmer Boys Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was both friendly & helpful. Burger tasty, got the one with both avocado & thousand island. Was excited for the combo which allowed 2 huge zucchini sticks & onion rings \"the best of both\" on the side, but frankly they were so bland I didn't finish them, as was the ranch dipping sauce. Disappointing. Something gave me a migraine. Not sure what.....won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Tried, and  I say tried to get two simple turkey sandwiches for take out.  Both were screwed up and it took forever.  How hard is turkey, lettuce tomato with mustard.    I got turkey on bread and nothing else."}
{"text":"Don't let the  country decor atmosphere fool you, my expectations were not met. Real country has thick hardy tasty beef not these thin bland ones. The onion rings and zucchini fries aren't as good as they look. Batter has a funny after taste. Luckily my girl order the chicken avocado sandwich, which was delicious! I took half ;)"}
{"text":"This place just gets better with every visit! I love the turkey sandwiches and the salads are huge and fantastic. We have had GREAT service even when they are super busy. A little pricey for fast food but even my cheap ass cant argue with quality. The only critcism I have is that their onion rings are super bland.  They need a better batter but no other complaints from me!!  This is my new go to place for a great burger, sandwich or salad!"}
{"text":"Am I at a fast food place? The service here is incredible! It's like the McDonald's you've always wanted.  Real breakfast,  burgers,  and all the sides, but casual and really well made.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Better go to Wendy's for a chicken sandwich. Order came out wrong... Twice. Food is mediocre at best, slopped together and thrown on a basket. Waste of money."}
{"text":"My new obsession! I'm pregnant and this is all I want, they're chicken strips are amazing. Even though it's 8:45 in the morning when I get them, they are still made fresh  every time!!!!!! They take a while but it's all for a good reason"}
{"text":"First time here.  I ordered a BLT w/No mayo on sourdough bread.    It was good but to be honest, I gave the bacon to my dog and put an egg on it instead, and I can make that at home...It was $7 ...     Ex ordered a burger and asked for no onion, no 1000 island and mayo on the side, The guy confirmed the order and when we got back here to eat, 1000 island, onions and no mayo!  Wrong order completely...  Probably won't go back just for that...   First impressions and all of that...  It was clean though and the guy behind the counter, Daniel, was nice and helpful..."}
{"text":"So one of the worst burgers I've had in awhile, was not fresh was a frozen patty and a big bun, go to red robin in and out or smash if your smart. Plus it was $8.00 wow . my wife said her salad was good she didn't want the chicken on it but we still got charged!"}
{"text":"I see negative reviews and I'm a little surprised. I have gone to this location about 5 times in the last 6-8 months since it's been opened. I did have a problem when I ordered a salad the second time I went after about 15-20 minutes no salad and I went to the counter to inquire and the manager quickly came over and got right on it. They seem to have forgot the order and they had it brought out to me in about 5-6 minutes. The manager brought it out with a card telling me my next meal is on him and he apologized. He handled it really well. Hey, mistakes are going to be made it how they handle it is what matters to me. Since then no problems. Tonight I went in there it was about 10pm. I ordered sat down and my meal was brought to me picture perfect, I mean the meal exactly like the menu picture. I wish I would have taken a picture cause I was so shocked. However the service was even better, the food expediter came out about 5-6 minutes to check on me and came through again about 15 minutes later to remove my tray for me. Very pleasant experience from beginning to end! I think people expectations are little too high when rating business especially fast food places."}
{"text":"Went to this location today. I figured its been almost 2 months let's try again. My boss was starving so I ventured out.  I have a very light colored leather interior in my vehicle.  Part of my order was 2 small sodas.  The girl Elizabeth went to hand them to me, and I noticed they had a lot of soda drops along the side of the cup.  I politely asked her if she could please wipe them off.  She replies to me with an 11th graders attitude tone, \"They aren't even dripping\". I was shocked! I couldn't believe such a normal request would warrant an argument.  I asked again, can you wipe them off or put them in a cup holder?  She looked at me like I was nuts, Finally I said \"Can you do it or not?\" And she says you don't need to be rude.  Um, is this a joke?  She slams the window in my face as she ignores the fact I asked for the manager.  When she returned I told her to get her manager.  She goes to the manager (I am witnessing all of this through the glass) and tells her side of the story.  Another cashier comes to the window and says, (with her purse on her shoulder, why is she serving or handling anything with her purse?) \"Is there anything I can do to make this experience more enjoyable?\" I said, yes you can get the manager.  She finally comes to the window I tell her exactly what happened.  She sits there like shocked, confused, lost? IDK But I was so livid that if I hadn't just spent $30 and half of the order wasn't for my boss I would have demanded a refund.  DO NOT go here.   PS: The rude, obnoxious, and obviously spoiled and favored \"cashier\" is named ELIZABETH.  This location needs to put the cashier's in their place, hire a manager with a backbone, and fire the cooks who ruin everything all the time. I am over it and will post reviews everywhere I can find an option.  Totally ridiculous, no offer of a discount, not a free cookie just um', oh, sorry mam.  I told the manager I felt bad she has to work with such a rude spoiled princess like Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I love Farmer Boys. Food has always been fresh, and you get huge portions! I've had the burger, chili, fries, shakes, and fried zucchini. I was very impressed with the burgers there.  Fresh food, great service, and a clean environment make Farmer Boys a great dining experience.  I highly recommend eating there."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out after a recommendation from a friend.  Casual dining experience.  Inexpensive menu items.  I decided on the clam chowder in a bread bowl.  Sourdough was moist and tasty and the crust was flakey.  Clam chowder was very good, but not much was served with my order.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place always has great food, service & I always leave full if not with delicious seconds to look forward to later. This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"If your vegetarian and looking for a yummy juicy burger then this place is definitely it! I'm always hesitant to try veggie burger because you never know what kind of veggie patty they'll use. This place has such a good burger and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fried zucchini. Pretty much the only thing that stands out here. It's a $4 side, but more commonly found at sit-down restaurants than a fast food version. It's actually a pretty giant portion, too. Tried it here for the first time after hearing others rave about it and was pleasantly surprised.  Rest of menu is typical salads (charbroiled chicken version is under 450 calls) and burgers, but they also get raves for their breakfast selection including omelets, bowls, and burritos. I appreciate that everything has a calorie count posted on their menus, even though it's not required here.   Service is friendly, location is new and fairly convenient, with a drive-thru.  EDIT: dropping a star. Came by for breakfast and twice now they've forgotten the avocado on the Cali omelet. Either they don't know the menu and don't bother to check, or they don't want to give it out."}
{"text":"Still one of the most delicious burger places near my home. Be patient, as it does take a few minutes for the food. But it's always fresh, flavorful, and piping hot. People always complain about the speed of service, well, McDonald's is across the street if you value speed over quality. For those who don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for quality food, this is the place. And everyone there is so nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Burnt tasting and expensive for small burgers. I've had better burgers at a gas station. Normally they are pretty good but not this time. Looks like it's back to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood at lunch time and wanted to try an informal place. This farmer boys look like it was brand new. In fact, there was a ton of construction in the parking lot with another eatery being built right next to this location. Ambience: when we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly young woman who was behind the counter. She helped us with our order. The restaurant itself is clean. Lots of booths around the periphery and tables in the middle. Service: when you go in, you go to the counter to place your order. They give you cups for beverages (self service on the  beverages) and a number which a place on your table. They then bring your food and silverware to the table. A very nice surprise was the number of times the staff came by the table to make sure that everything was going well during the meal. Had a question that one of the staff couldn't answer and she went and promptly got her manager to the table. Way above my expectations for an informal restaurant such as this. Food: my wife and I each ordered the Cobb salad. Less than $8 a head. The portion was huge. The presentation was quite nice ( see the photograph). And quality was excellent. Lots of bacon, eggs, chicken, tomatoes, cheese, and romaine lettuce. The blue cheese dressing was a little bit thinner than I generally like but not a significant drawback. A delicious salad at a very reasonable price. An excellent choice for an informal lunch."}
{"text":"Farmer boys is fantastic.  The food is great and NOT fast food so be aware if you use the drive through. You're going to be there a while.  But it is so worth it.  If you go in side the service is just like a restaurant. A person walks around refilling your coffee etc. Just a tip, we always call in our order so it is ready when we get there. The app is great except you can't order on it. If I were to suggest anything that would be it. Improve the app so we can order and then drive there.  Use the app though because you get points which build up to dollar amounts.  Another quick point is make sure you scan your receipt before 24 hours. I didn't know that and lost the points on one of our visits because it wasn't in the 24 hour time frame. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's a clean environment. The cashier worker was friendly. The hamburger I ordered was plentiful for 10$. It was the farmer boy burger with avocado, bacon, two patties, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and pink sauce. A lot of my friends swore by it, but I still enjoy five guys much more. And I bought the 5$ grilled cheese for my daughter and it was way more expensive for what it was. I could've bought a whole loaf of white bread and cheese for half that price."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The staff are always pleasant. But, the service is always sooooo slow! I don't go as often as I think about going because it always takes so long to get my order. Today, in the drive through there were 2 cars in front of me - literally 20 minutes later I got my cobb salad. Going inside isn't better."}
{"text":"I live 5 fucking miles away. I specifically told the girl when ordering NO 1000 Island Dressing on my burger. She even typed it into the computer right. I get home and there is Fucking 1000 Island Dressing on my god damn burger!! Its garbage! I don't eat that crap. Had to throw is away. So fucking pissed if you couldnt tell. Thanks for making me spend $12 on a meal when I can only eat the sides."}
{"text":"Being a California native, I miss those burger joints that you can only find in SoCal. Farmer Boys comes close, although going thru the drive thru was a long wait. 2 cars were before me. It took about 15 minutes to get to the window. Service was excellent, although by the time I got home, food was cold. Maybe next time we will go in. Food was okay, decent for a burger and fries. Zucchini is huge, a 4 piece is a quartered whole zucchini. A little bit too thick, but didn't taste bad at all."}
{"text":"I was so excited to use my new cupon that I received  for down loading the app. I ordered a bacon guacamole burger I ordered extra pickles and well done bacon and well done patty. Of course this isn't what I received. There was only 2 pickle pieces ,the bacon wasn't even rigid and the meat was still bleeding . It did taste good but I can't tolerate eatting raw meat so I threw it away.....way to follow the customers request."}
{"text":"This is a paradise for eaters of dead animals, but not so much for vegetarians, despite the claim of \"farm to table.\"  I certainly consider myself an omnivore, yet found the menu took heavy on fried, cheesy, bready stuff.  Table service was S L O W, and the men's room smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in several days.  When the store is located in Las Vegas, it gets hot, and you need good ventilation/AC.  That wasn't the case here."}
{"text":"While the same grumpy horrible shift manager works here. The food is just so yummy I had to come back. And the manager is so bubbly and sweet as are 99% of the people that work here.   The tables are kept clean, they come around often and check in with you.   Just keep in mind the food is cooked to order and avoid the drive through, its just not very quick."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this review is based off the last three visits over the last two months.   When this location opened, I was excited to try something new. I had seen them all over town, but only stopped in at this location. When they first opened, the food and service were excellent! I enjoyed everything about it, until the last three visits.  Three visits ago, I noticed that the food wasn't as good as it was when they first opened. I ordered chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were drenched in grease and my fries were cold. I blotted my chicken and chalked it up to them being busy.   Two visits ago, I decided to get a burger (no bun, sauces, or onions) with veggies and fries. When it came out it was drenched in sauce and onions! I took it back and got an attitude for bringing it back. They grudgingly fixed it and the burger tasted funny to me.  The last visit I decided to give the chicken fingers another go. This time the chicken wasn't cooked through and I again got an attitude for bringing it back.   I will never eat here again. It's not worth my health or sanity!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Pretty unimpressive burgers. Processed cheese makes The Natural a bit of a misnomer. Zucchini is pretty good but nothing I can't make at home for cheaper and the breading on the onion rings falls off before it reaches your mouth.  We'll try again for breakfast some other time and see if it is any better."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to Farmer Boys a couple years ago. I wouldn't say were regulars but we go there as often as possible.   The food is decent, the fried zucchini, i wsdh they'd batter it better and fry it a bit longer. Been a few times we bite into a warm piece but it's cold in the middle.   Tonight we went through drive thru and we're the only vehicle in line. I know it's cook to order byt almost 20 minutes at the window is pretty ubsurbed to me.   Overall, we'll be back but not in the drive thru"}
{"text":"The veggie burger was meh.. The fries were a mix of super hot and freezing cold fries.. Not impressed . We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I am very disappointed. The food took forever to come out today and it wasn't even busy. The quality was just ok today and since they are close I probably will come back to give them another try BUT not when I'm in a hurry like I was today. It took over 25 minutes for my burger.  Last time it was less then 10 minutes and they were packed!!! It hasn't been that long since they opened.... I'm wondering if the service will pick back up?  Cheese want even melted on my burger.  It was COLD!! What a huge difference from that first visit!! :( :( :(  the fries were soggy.... Burger was lukewarm.... Fried jalapeÃ±os were greasy on my farm burner burger. Food (1/5) Sadly, I think McDonald's across the street would have been better. :(  People that came in after me got their food first? How is the cool??  And the kicker to the not so good experience was that I couldn't use the $5off for downloading their app. When I downloaded it.... It never said that there was a deadline on when I had to use that coupon by. So I couldn't use it and they didn't even apologize for that. It was just like oh well u gotta read the fine print... And I understand that's a mistake on my part BUT I think if there is a time limit that it should clearly be stated somewhere. :( and there should have been an apology at least.  My first visit, they touched my table numerous times to see how things were going.... Today all i got was the food drop off.  Service (1/5)  Very very disappointed since my last visit with them was so good. I hope they get back to where they were. If they keep going at this rate.... They are going to be losing customers. :("}
{"text":"I am used to farmer boys as I have been to one in Anaheim many many times. Great breakfast,  good burgers, clean restaurant,  up beat friendly service. What's not to like. I do however remember it being a little cheaper in California"}
{"text":"FarmerBoys has great zucchini strips, good pancakes, and good sundaes.  The service was outstanding for a fast food restaurant.  We had 2 employees check on us while we were eating to make sure everything was okay.  Hokie was so nice and even cleaned up our table when we were finished."}
{"text":"I wish they had Farmer Boys in Arizona!! They are known to have good burgers but as a vegetarian I dare not try! My dad likes the breakfast and says they have the best sausage...he doesn't normally eat sausage unless it's Farmer Boys. My mom and I enjoyed the veggie burgers but in my opinion, the must try  is the zucchini! The zucchini is super sized and yummy! Their onions rings are also super sized! I recommend Farmer Boys for breakfast, lunch or dinner....but you definitely have to try the zucchini! Staff is usually friendly. Download their app and sign up for VIF to get $5 off....enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great bugers haven't tryed it all but what I did was great the staff was nice and the place clean I did not have to wait long over all it was great as far as a hamburger can go"}
{"text":"Walking in I felt like it reminded me of Culver's but after tasting the food I was awoken. I ordered their fish and chips dish dinner with the broccoli cheddar soup. Both dishes were well composed and quite filling. Across the table my lady ordered their classic burger and fries which wasn't average! I definitely will be back for more! Good spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Its a fast food restraunt but if you eat there they serve you on real plates and have real silverware to use like a diner.. The food is always delicious and filling. I love the French Toast!!  They are a little expensive but, its good. Drive thru or walk in The staff seemed to be nice just hard to understand. The menu is served all day from breakfast to dinner. We will be back."}
{"text":"Drive thru takes forever.... food is good and drink sizes are pretty big. They have military discount which is pretty nice of them"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and they didnt do anything right.  The breakfast was fine which is why they got 2 stars.  Everything else was cold.  I took it all back and had them remake it.  Guess what the next order was cold also.  The lady on the phone said that everything was made fresh, well i guess everything except mine.  Wont be back unless its for breakfast."}
{"text":"Hubby and I felt like breakfast for dinner. Aince we walked into the door, wvwryone was so helpful and our dining experience was awesome. I especially want to commend Tiffany Hand for the incredible service. Felt like we were dining in 5 star reataurant, maybe we were!!!!!!!! Will be going back many times for sure."}
{"text":"Really huge salads and very fresh ingredients. Staff was very helpful as it was our first time there. A bit pricey for our budget but we will go back occasionally. Restaurant was clean and service was good."}
{"text":"I had a burger and fries. First time at one of these franchises. I hate to give a bad rating but... first the positives. Restaurant appeared clean and spacious, food looked ok. But it was just that, ok. Burger was tasteless. Poor quality meat, fried and not seasoned. Couldn't taste the cheese or bread either. Made the burger taste like a lettuce and tomato sandwich with some cardboard in the middle. And it was a little sloppy and wet. Sorry. It's true. Burger gets 1.5 Stars and that may be generous. I was hungry and I almost didn't eat it but choked most of it down. Fries were average at best. A little undercooked maybe and just fried potatoes. No taste. I seasoned them myself which is ok and they were a little better. Quantity was generous. Fries get 2 Stars. The time from order complete to food served was about 18 minutes. Service was ok and friendly. Service gets 3.5 Stars. I probably won't go back, but if I do it will be to try the breakfast maybe."}
{"text":"This place is always very clean, the staff is friendly (always a fan of that) and the food is pretty good. Not the best food you will ever eat but decent for the price. You walk in, order, pay and then they bring you your food. I usually get the burger and if you check in on Yelp they have a special. Check it out :)"}
{"text":"Two pull helping on drive thu and manager seating eating wow 5 ppl waiting in lobby for food and no food yet"}
{"text":"Ok, people seem to love this place.  I've had breakfast and lunch here once.  Food is ok, nothing to rave about for sure.  People working here have been friendly, courteous, and helpful.  Better than fast food, yes."}
{"text":"Horrible drive-thru line. Every single time we come the line takes 20 to 30 minutes. It is no longer convenient to stop here. Do yourself a favor and stop somewhere else that'll get you out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Ugh I love Farmer Boys and I'm so happy I no longer have to drive far to get it. It's both a blessing and a curse to have one so close to me - here's goes my chances of losing the baby weight! haha, jk! The food here is always fresh, which is why it takes a while (for fast food standards) to get your food. The employees here and very friendly and they even allowed me to split up my transactions so I could use both of the offers I had on my app. Gotta appreciate an establishment that supports you trying to save some money. I got the breakfast burrito, the hubby got a burger, and my toddler got a kids breakfast platter. The burrito was a perfect combination of sausage, eggs, hash browns, and pico de gallo! I always end up ordering it here despite the time of day! My husband enjoyed his burger. He shared his zucchini fries with me and it was SO delicious. Tastes the best with the ranch which i also love from here. The kids breakfast platter was pretty standard, nothing special there. I'm sure I'll be back here very soon. FYI, download the app to save five bucks off of your first offer. Their rewards program makes it easy to accumulate rewards!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Farmers Boy and I was not one bit impressed.  My husband and boys would always mentÃ³n how good this place is and the burgers so they decided to let me in on the experience.  The way I can describe it is by saying that we could have gone to McDonald's, purchased the same thing and paid less.  Literally.  I ordered a burger with jalapeÃ±os on it,  got sine regular burger.  I don't know what was going on with their \"sauce\" but it was a very watered down version of macsauce. I asked half fries and half onion rings I got decent amount of fries and 1 onion ring.  = McDonald's issue with orders always wrong.  Not impressed at all.  Peru upset actually because I could have gone elsewhere with my money and gotten something that was actually good.  The ONLY positive was the service."}
{"text":"I went there to get chicken fingers for my 4 year old. He wasn't into them so when I went to bite into one, they were 100 percent raw ! They were rude about it and their customer service was terrible. Do not eat here unless you like getting sick."}
{"text":"First time there, never heard of it, close to my job decided to check it out. Inside it look different from other fast food restaurant it got a theme and it clean. The employee greeted us which is nice. Me and my sis got  a burger w/ fries and  onion ring. The burger is really good, need a bit of seasoning on fries, and the onion ring got no flavored. The result? Customer service: good, Place: clean, Food: not bad...Overall it ok"}
{"text":"Food was ok but was overshadowed by the horrible customer service the cashier Christopher provided!"}
{"text":"Hearty food and very filling. They have weekend family specials along with weekday specials. You get a lot of food for the dollar. I liked this place because it's away from the crowd on Decatur. Everyone can eat something here, they have salads, burgers, sandwiches, fried zucchini, veggie burgers. The fried zucchini's were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burrito for 7 bucks served all day. Eggs, hash brown potatoes, cheese and salsa fresca were inside. All the flavors melded well and if i lived here, I would probably enjoy this item once a week. They are famous for avocado, so will add that next time, but great start to the day or for your trip back to wherever your going."}
{"text":"We had to wait 30 minutes for a burger and fries, had  Diet Pepsi in the regular Pepsi tower. Fries were cold and zucchini was raw. The girl sweeping the floor had to bring us our food. We are not likely to return to this location."}
{"text":"I do not like to give bad reviews. This place has been open for 1 month. Given time, hopefully they can get it together.   Went for breakfast, ordered omelette with hash browns. The food was NOT seasoned at all. And it was barely warm, yet the eggs were over cooked.   The 2 stars is for the helpful, yet surprisingly young, cashier.   I don't see a reason to ever come back.  Ok: 1 hour later - I felt nauseated and got sick. No more Farmer Boys"}
{"text":"I was in California a few months back and discovered Farmer Boys...I commented...I wish you had a store in Las Vegas....the person helping me said...\"actually we have 4 locations in Las Vegas\" (even more now)..now we go there all the time. Great food, reasonable prices...and a Real Breakfast that's always available.    If you want an amazing salad try the Harvest Salad its awesome and served in a REAL bowl that's Huge!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The worst food ever. Long line and nobody there.had the fish and chips and it was deep fried fish but no fish. It's like they breaded nothing and through it in the flyer again. Sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"Good place to get a real breakfast to go.  Not egg sandwiches real breakfast food Omelettes french toast eggs to order  Haven't eaten any burgers"}
{"text":"I usually come here for the wraps. A coworker brought their battered fish and zucchini sticks so good!! I was craving them so I stopped. I waited for a solid 10min. They did not give me any lemon or Tatar sauce, but hey... At least I got napkins and 4 containers of ranch. Small mistake but very annoying since this location is not close to my area, not driving back for some lemon wedges and tartar sauce. The meal did not taste as good without those condiments :( I guess next time must check bag before driving off and asking for those items specifically because apparently people eat fish with ranch."}
{"text":"I've driven by so many times and FINALLY made it inside. All I can say is why have I waited so long. All of the food not only looks but actually is good!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Don't forget to look up coupons on farmerboys.com before you get here."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food! So I've been to Farmer Boys several times in the past, however I never had to change my baby's diaper while in there, this time I found out that they don't have a changing table station inside their bathroom. This place is definitely not family friendly, not coming back!"}
{"text":"Yum for Farmer Boys!!! I freaking love this place. I could order 100 of their fried zucchini and never get tired of eating them; they are so delicious and perfect with ranch dressing. Unfortunately, I forgot that they had them so I had onion rings with my turkey bacon melt and took a half of my friend's zucchini stick. Even though it was crowded they were quick with my group's orders, and there were no complaints from my buddies. Not to mention the military discount, which I wasn't aware of before! I just might have to go to the one in my hometown in California more often -- the ones here in Vegas are a bit far away from where I live.  The onion rings were also delicious and crunched easily (meaning the actual onion part didn't slide out of the batter when I took a bite). I find it easiest to take a knife and cut them in half before dipping it into ranch. Those were pretty good, too. Overall, great experience. I hope they open one closer to the UNLV area!"}
{"text":"I get its rush hour but they gave me a dissembled sandwich like really!?! My meat was off to the side the tomatoes were squished not only that they put a bucket of mayo on it so everything is soggy wet and disgusting also you didn't cut the sandwich.. I've worked at a farmer boys for 2 years and never have I seen this. Get your crap together guys an extra 2 min in a drive thru is worth the wait for an EATABLE sandwich."}
{"text":"Who would ever imagine a restaurant named \"Farmer Boy\"s to be an interesting place to eat? Well, the average city person that is.  Well, you can rest assured that for myself, it has been nothing but great! A little pricey with some things, yet still well worth the visits.  They have the most unique menu options I've seen in a while and nothing is pre-cooked. You get some of the most incredible meals and with generous portioning.  When it comes to dessert the pricing is unreasonable yet their shakes alone cause you to ignore the price and just enjoy!  If it weren't for the high pricing, I'd give this restaurant a 5 star rating without hesitation!"}
{"text":"Pretty good upgrade fast food eatery. We stopped here for lunch. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger with onion rings (the thickest you may ever find). I had a breakfast sandwich (wasn't too hungry). It was really satisfying. Prices a little on the high side, but that's OK because the good food is worth it. Nicely decorated in country style decor. Pleasant restaurant. Recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  So far, so good.  While they have a drive-thru and you can take your meal to go, this is not you run of the mill fast food place.  They have a great selection for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  It's a great place to bring the family for a casual meal.  The restaurant is clean and well organized.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The food is really good.  While they aren't cheap, they aren't expensive either.  You definitely get you money's worth here.   If you're in the area, give it a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Man I love farmer boys! And I'm pissed I'm not the 1st to review this location! Dammit, why don't I think of these things?   Zucchini is huge! Crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside! Dip it in ranch, awesome!  Burger is huge! Its beefy! Some of them come with guac and bacon like the Farmer's!  They have breakfast! You can get fresh eggs your way and hash browns!  It's inexpensive! You can eat a meal for less than 10 bucks! And this location has a 10% discount for unlv students and faculty!  And there's a drive through!   More like farmer genius!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. I'm from Calif. and this is the closest we can get to a cheese burger special. Food is always hot and fresh. Long wait in the drive thru, but that's to be expected with Farmer Boys. The food is worth the wait. I like that you can download their app. and upload your receipt and accumulate points to receive 5.00 of your next order."}
{"text":"Cold diner food. Blah. Last Sunday mom and I drove down to the restaurant which was pretty busy, and placed a big order to go. They had our order ready in about 20 minutes. When we got home, literally a 3 minute drive, most of the food was cold. I'm not sure what happened, because they have about 20 people working in the kitchen. Mom got an omelette and French toast, and a side of fruit which was from a can. Fail. My brother got some kind of breakfast bowl which is similar to the kind you get at Jack in the crack, and he did not like it. My dad got the tuna sandwich and fries, which were cold but tasty, he said the sandwich was ok. I got the pastrami and it was good but small, my boyfriend got the bacon burger with onion rings. He liked the burger but the onion rings were a complete fail. The breading was falling off the onion rings, and guess what? They were cold. We spent about $60 for everything and to say I was disappointed is an understatement."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Very disappointed, because I was so excited to try this place. Their food is over priced so I expected quality taste. Their burgers were bland and tasteless, service was slow. I expected more from you Farmer Boys."}
{"text":"Added a star for a few reasons.   -The rewards club is pretty great. For every dollar you spend, you get points and when you get 60 points you get $5 off. They also send random perks like free sides, or a few bucks off an entree.  -They give you a free entree for your birthday.  -They have delicious ranch that they give to you at no charge.  -They have daily specials that include entree, a side and a drink for $8.99. I usually get a daily special, and if I use My $5 off, I get a full meal for around $5. - - - - The bbq chicken ranch wrap is amaze balls. -The sides are massive and you can choose deep fried zucchini, onion rings, or fries.  The only negative is the drive thru is very busy and super slow. It can take up to 20 minutes to get food, which is almost half of my lunch. The good news is, if you go inside and order it's much faster. Sometimes I just don't wanna get out of the car though."}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh. However 2 stars is for fact of wait time. I do not want fresh food as fast as you get McDonalds, but come on 30 mins for 2 salads and a breakfast sandwich!!! Rolled thru at 7 to feed my kids on way to school and 7 people inside, couple cars in drive thru and take a WILD GUESS how many cooks they have working???? If you guessed 1, you would be correct, but I'd say more like .75 after watching her make the food, ZERO since of urgency. Ohwell never been here before today, and guess no reason to return unless you got your to kill for a salad and breakfast sandwich....."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Took much longer than I expected.  Watched drive thru line get food before me (2 cars) and the lady behind me got her food first too.  Ordered bacon burger and fries ... nothin fancy or special ordered.  Wont come here if I have limited time."}
{"text":"Used to get really good experiences at this location. In the past three or four months noticed a lot of new faces.  Before everyone seemed happy to be there.  Not anymore. The last two times coming here the service and food has been poor.  First poor experience, stopped for lunch only one other table with people at it.  It took 15 minutes to get our food and everything was cold. I had heard the cook ring the bell for an order. While I didn't pay much attention it sat there for probably 5-7 minutes before they brought it to our table.  Experience today.  Brought my dad for Father's day breakfast.  It was busy and we didn't mind the 30 minutes it took to get our food.  But while waiting No one offered refills on coffee, had to ask someone that was bussing tables.  When we finally got our food the French toast was ice cold, the hashbrowns, eggs, and sausage was hot. Had to send it back it was so cold.  They really need to get back on track of they plan on keeping me as a customer."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever been here. I had the natural avocado bacon cheeseburger which is very good and I also ordered the Colossal onion rings. I picked the seven piece option because I thought the four-piece wouldn't be enough. Well they're colossal alright but I was disappointed because they're kind of messy and the breading that was on there which wasn't much fell off when I picked them up, not your typical crunchy onion ring. It was nothing like the mobile app picture, so I won't be buying these again especially at $4.89 which is a pretty steep price to pay for a side."}
{"text":"What a great way to start the day we where greeted at the door by Catthy . She's so amazing at her job place looks really clean !"}
{"text":"We decided to try Farmer Boys today for lunch.... WOW!  We ordered the zucchini for our sides and I promise - you only want to order the 4 piece.  The 4 piece Zucchini is a whole zucchini cut into 4ths long ways, battered and fried.... Oh My!  So yummy. My complaint - the little tiny ranch dressing isn't enough.   For sandwiches we both got the Farmer's Burger - it was too big for me. I will probably try the patty melt next time. Oh - good - yea - that Farmer Burger is damned good!  But huge - dinner will be late today.  My little guy wanted pancakes - even the pancakes were a slam dunk.   My oldest had a chocolate shake and my youngest a vanilla - big shakes with high quality ice cream.   It was $32 for 2 4 piece zucchini, 2 Farmer's Burgers, 2 shakes and a Hot Cake order.  That - to me - is comparable."}
{"text":"They have great food  the employees are extremely  nice. My only complaint  is that they dont season there food. Although they kphave Tabasco and Chalula in the tabels."}
{"text":"The last couple of times we've been here there were a couple of issues, but not enough to complain. Tonight was a complete disappointment. The woman who took our order was very nice. But the quality of food was bad. After she handed us the food we were driving off and I opened the box. First of all, I thought they changed the recipe of the fries. They looked brown, almost like seasoned fries. When I tried one they were really cold. So we decided we should go in and say something. My boyfriend went inside and within 3-5 minutes they gave us another batch of fries. I tried one and they felt really hot, so that was enough for me, we were all hungry and wanted to hurry home. Well once we were home we realized how soggy and greasy they were. Some even felt a little cold and hard in the center. Our burgers were cold by that time, of course. My boyfriend ended up throwing his meal away and I was so hungry I just decided to deal with it. I'm really disappointed and I hope this location steps up the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend on September 21st because I had a birthday entree. First of all the manager was super friendly, he was patient while we were figuring what we wanted, he was funny just engaging with us regardless if it was 9 pm. The other guy that also helped me was really nice and friendly as well but the manager was just perfect! Love the costumer service at this place and their food was bomb! I had the bacon turkey melt and my bf had the farmers burger , he said he hadn't had a burger that was that well made and amazing in a long time! And he's picky. Thank you Farmer Boys!!"}
{"text":"Nice diner atmosphere, good food and service.  I get the natural burger a lot.  A bit pricey but if u can spend 10$ on a lunch try it once."}
{"text":"Price is right. Nothing fancy..but a great burger, quick. Employees are really nice..and the mgr is cool too..walking around making sure everyone in the place is enjoying their foor. Unexpected as this is kind of like a fast food place..totall impressed with the attention to service. Thanks !"}
{"text":"They have good soup in the winter. The only reason of 4 str and no 5 is that the soup in bread is only in the winter."}
{"text":"Dummy head doesn't know what's on the burger.. I had asked for no onions and she said it didn't come with onion! I order the same thing every time! I know what is on the burger! And when I got it! It had onions on it!!!! It's okay though, I scraped them off and now it's delicious. I love farmer boys so much"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 10 stars.  I love this place.  The food is amazing everytime, never disappoints.  My favorite is the turkey bacon melt, sooo good."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, clean & fair prices.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"This was my second time going here the first time was good I had the pancake meal and my husbands had the bacon boy burger..  Today we go back and it was all bad... We both ordered the bacon boy and got no bacon second fries were cold third I wanted sweet tea. Which they don't have.. She offered raspberry I accepted and what did I get to my surprise unsweetened tea. Thank you farmer boys"}
{"text":"The menu looked great. They have some unique items that looked really good. The ambiance is in between a restaurant and a fast food place. The price's are pretty good as well.The problems began after we ordered. It took exceptionaally long to get our food, and the place was by no means crowded. When the food finally arrived, it was cold. This is a 3 star place on it's best day. Long wait and cold food..gotta give them a 2."}
{"text":"My buddy loves this spot.  He has been here like 10 times since it has opened.   I had previously been to one out near Mt. Charleston and had thought it to be a bit above the other burger place options so I was excited when one opened near me.  I was a bit up in the air based on other reviews but those were mainly based off of the service of a new restaurant so I decided to try it out.   I originally pulled up at night in the drive thru and immediately saw that it would be a while even though only one car was in front of me so I decided to back out, park, and go inside.  I ordered a Big Cheese meal with fries and a Chicken Avocado on sourdough.  It took about 6 or so minutes to get my food which was a lot better than what I had been led to believe.    Got home, burger was soggy and a little above room temperature but not terrible although the structural integrity had been lost at this point.  Fires were hot, could tell they were fresh, and were overall enjoyable.  Chicken sandwich was hot, fresh, tasty, although a bit under seasoned but again, was soggy, due to there being guacamole and sauce right on the bread with no barrier so there was again, little structural integrity.    I wasn't disappointed but I was let down a bit.  Maybe I was just tired or maybe my hopes were too high this particular night, idk.  I don't think I will be coming back here though, at least for a while."}
{"text":"Awful! Our food sat in expo until we finally got up to get it. (Food was COLD) When we asked for our food the manager, Katrina, stacked our food on top of one another. When we commented about her putting the dirty plate's bottom onto the top of our food she rudely replied that it was \"sanitary\"  DISGUSTING! I will never go back and with health code violations like that I'd advise everyone I know to stay away from that restaurant! Gross!"}
{"text":"First Visit this evening and Drive Thru not busy...pattie melts great and onion rings awesome. ..I really liked the idea not one item was in \" A Landfill Styrofoam Container\"  I'll  be back for that feature alone. ."}
{"text":"Went here not very long after opening and as you would expect, there are still some kinks. Service is very good though, everyone very friendly. I had the fried fish and fries which were a little greasy but since it's new I know this may only be due to the new-ness of the place. Don't make a special trip but if you're passing by, it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"What could have been a delicious breakfast turned very bad by the HEAPING glob of DISGUSTING margarine they put on the pancakes and toast.  Who uses that disgusting stuff?  It is so bad for you and taste like chemicals.   It ruined our breakfast.   We asked for toast with real butter but they don't have any so we got naked dry toast and fake creamer in our coffee they don't have real half and half.  So if you like real food you won't like it here.  If you eat chemicals at home then try it out.  I"}
{"text":"Had a great salad at the Farmer Boy on Rainbow yesterday.   Went in to wash my hands before the meal. Restroom closed . Server said go ahead and use. No one in either bathroom cleaning. Paper towel dispenser gave me 6 inches of cheap paper then wouldn't give another for about a minute. Used 5 napkins.  Onion rings were BAD.  Had my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Service not friendly or helpful and food was mediocre.   She (cashier) did not seem to know how the restaurant's loyalty program worked even though it is plastered all over the building.  Please refresh the workers or at least buzz them on what is happening"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it was a 3-4 star lunch spot before today.   I haven't really been able to eat for 2 days due to the loss of my grandmother and grieving. So i stopped in here for lunch break today as its close to my job. I was in line and was waiting patiently to take my turn in line. Some young kid cuts to the front of the line with his buddy and the cashier sees him and says nothing just welcomes him to the counter and takes his order like nothing happened. Another girl decides to jump on the register by the door ans screams out next ...i look to see if the guy in front of me is going to go and she yells out looking at me ..come on who's next lets go. I walk up and ask her for a hamburger meal with avocado and a chocolate shake. She says do you want fries with that.... i say ..yes i just told you i wanted the meal. She replies with you obviously need to speak up because i didn't hear you....she then is banging away on her register to show me she is irritated with me then snaps at me and says what size shake do you want....i tell her small and she makes me repeat it again.  She tells me the total and snatches the 20.00 out of my hand and gives me back the change. I ask for a receipt and she rolls her eyes at me and bangs away again on the register hands me receipt and turns her back on me walks to the back counter and turns and looks at me while she is talking to someone else to let me know shes discussing me. The woman was thin and dark skinned with a long black ponytail and a nasty disposition.  Ticket number 488813-2  at 12:54 sever 20- shelby.  I hope a manger speaks with her about the simple kindness she could show her guests and that a pleasant attitude and smile could go a long way . You never know what someone else may be going thru and to have to deal with that while I'm already grieving was something that could have been avoided."}
{"text":"Kick ass spot. Good breakfast just no other option besides pork for meat choices. But just got more hashbrowns instead.   Burgers are great too. Ate the avocado bacon burger.  Fresh bread and just all around good burger."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. I was only person in drive-thru. It took 14 minutes to get a hamburg. I will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"The staple of the Inland Empire in Sin City, who knew. Thanks to Yelp, I found one of my favorite places for breakfast away from home.  The family and I enjoyed the typical great service, reasonable prices, and fresh food in Vegas. The kids and my wife had the French Toast meals with eggs, sausage and bacon. I ordered the breakfast burrito which comes with sausage, cheese, scrambled egg, and I added some pico de galo sauce. Oh so good and fresh.     The family and I enjoyed coming here for breakfast because it gave us a break from the strip and the expensive, crazy, busy buffets. It's was a 5 minute drive for us from the Flamingo. It was nice to have a quiet breakfast and be surrounded by friendly staff. Keep up the great work Farmer Boys Vegas!        Don't forget breakfast is served all day, woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru at 9pm and ordered a chicken sandwich lettuce was old and chicken completely dry.  Not fresh at all got served left over food even though place closes at 10pm, so much for FRESH FOOD.. never coming back"}
{"text":"The food was not all that good and it was very pricey. It was clean and there were no problems. Not a place that I will go back to visit but some people seemed happy."}
{"text":"Ordered food for take out 2 days ago and when I got it home it wasn't edible . The frys were so soggy with grease and the onion rings were so greasy that the breeding fell off the onion when you picked them up. Zucchini sticks were the same way . The meat in the burger was cold . It was such a disappointment. Been here several times and it was always good but after this experience I will not be back ."}
{"text":"We use to love coming to farmer boys, but the customer service is getting worse. The time it takes for them to get your food is ridiculous and the food is also declining. I'm not sure how many more chances I will give."}
{"text":"I love this location! Every time I walk in I get a big \"hello\" from everyone in front! I've only been 3 times but it feels like I'm a regular every time. The food is amazing and the employees are very attentive."}
{"text":"New burger spot and by our house, score! Had heard good things about this place so of course I got curious.   First thing I noticed was they served a lot more than just burgers so I was excited about that. They serve breakfast as well as a variety of salads (which looked huge) and sandwiches, in addition to their burgers.   I optes to try the turkey melt, which was by far the best I have ever had. It wasn't oily or greasy like some places I've had it at. The onion rings...all I have to say is the onions they use are not average onions. The rings were gigantic. They only serve a few peices but it's by far plenty to fill a person up.   I'd like to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"So I go to this new restaurant that i see . I noticed that firehouse subs was really busy so I thought I would try out Farmer boys well I pull up . I go through the drive-through I order my food . I am stuck in the drive-through for 35 minutes . almost my entire lunch time I get up to the window and then they proceed to tell me that they can't accept my debit card . now it's a normal debit card that I use with the bank.  now I just spent 35 minutes in the drive-through wasting my lunch for these people to tell me that they don't except normal banking debit cards are you kidding me I didn't even get a chance to try their food that was the first time I've ever gone to that restaurant and it will be the last"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a good weekend breakfast so I read the reviews it sounded fresh and good. NOT! I walked in, then realized it was just another greasy, nasty, smelly (like rancid fryer oil) fast food place, YUK, I turned around and walked OUT!  Don't be fooled !"}
{"text":"Love this place ;) Great fresh food and always taste good and great costumer service!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever! I had the Sourdough Chicken Avacado & fried zucchini. The quality of the food is beyond amazing. The price you're paying is completely worth it. And customer service is spectacular. John, Xena, and Veronica were amazing. I came in 10 minutes before they closed and they let me stay & eat inside. Kahanu is the best manager ever. He was so kind and very genuine! Will definitely come back to this location"}
{"text":"Oh this place was nightmare. I thought it would be country style restaurant not sad sloppy drive Thursday pretending to be a restaurant. The food was dripping with grease, the bread was stale and the inside needed a scrub. There weren't even caps on the sauces on the table! Needless we not be returning."}
{"text":"Whatever you order, make sure to get the zucchini sticks on the side. They are really good. Burgers are good but nothing really special. Service is good. Halfway restaurant and halfway fast food. You order like it's fast food but they serve you like it's a restaurant. Quick. Tasty. And filling, for sure. Satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this real simple... I love to eat at this place! The only thing you have to look out for is the portions.lol! I will only order food here when I'm off of work to have a burger meal lol!! Aka really good food#foodcoma.. The only down side is the wait time.. but everything else is good"}
{"text":"If I walk into your establishment, look at the menu and you don't come and take my order... just bad service. No one in line. If I can see you then I'm pretty sure you not only see me but you heard me come in. Was really looking forward to some fries and a shake.  And no it's not a racist thing. Thee were different ethnicities in there eating. Just bad service."}
{"text":"Unbelievably BAD. If the bacon is locally sourced, then the poor pigs are starving. The egg (I didn't want three eggs, but of course I paid the same amount for one egg) was floating in grease. Tomatoes, on the side were tragic. Coffee was bland, OJ was tolerable, but if it is fresh-squeezed, oranges used must be dry, and withered.  And to top it off this mess cost $15.00 smackeroos. For gawd's sake go to any, and I mean any other breakfast spot (including Mickey D's)"}
{"text":"They did not,open on time. Employees just standing around at 6:10 goofing off. They saw me and another person standing outside.  One employee was prepping food without gloves.  I have Called Las Vegas health department."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fast service but a little pricey for fast food. I had a patty melt and onion rings and they were both very tasty. Food comes out very quickly and seems to be made to order. This place gets busy at lunch so be sure to come early to avoid a line. I would come back if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"I am a fan of farmer boys, particularly the one on rainbow. But not this one. Our table didn't have ketchup, in between orders the cashier would just walk away (not even say anything) the cashier was rude, and so was the person who brought us our food. Everyone who works here looks miserable. Atleast be nice to customers who are nice to you. Also the door bell was rung multiple times and they didn't say \"ThankYou\" or any cheering which I thought was part of their celebration that the customer was satisfied? Anyways, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"So after three horrendous interactions with this place I finally decided enough is enough. My order was wrong three times in a row. \"Corporate office\" reached out to me via Yelp and sent me a message asking that I give them a call about the review I post. I called them back, was put on hold multiple times over and over again while attempting to discuss the ridiculous and embarrassing experiences I've had with the company and the lack of customer service and service staff not know how to properly execute a simple order and the manager not being able to manage their employees she sad there quietly while I talked took down my information and stated that she was going to send an email \"right away and have someone call me first thing\" how pathetic that I NEVERTHELESS receive a call back. This company is GARBAGE!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY. THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service! The natural burgers are the best thing! The zucchini is the best I've had since living in Vegas."}
{"text":"It is unusual to give a fast food place a 5 star but this definitely deserves the rating.  Manager/cashier took extra time to help us with the menu, making suggestions about add-ons and explaining the preparation of items of interest.  The service was prompt and we were checked on a couple of times by friendly staff after lunch arrived.  The place was very busy but food was coming out pretty quickly.  The pastrami sandwich was  excellent with a generous amount of meat.  My bacon burger with provolone was a gourmet indulgence.  Be prepared for a \"run down your arm\" delight.  Yummmm. We opted for the onion rings and zucchini sides.  Enjoyed the rings with the different than usual breading.  One zucchini was delicious but the other could have been cooked more.  However the portions on each lunch were so generous that we couldn't finish anyway.   Be sure to check in to receive their promotion which I didn't do but we felt the prices were more than fair for the amount and quality of  food received.  We hope to find another Farmer Boys on our travels."}
{"text":"I have been craving a Pastrami sandwich and chili fries so my husband and I came to this location. I ordered a Pastrami sandwich with chili fries and my husband got a double chili cheese burger with zucchini fries. My husband received a single patty so he took it to the counter, showed the Burger and the receipt, yet the cook rudely insisted he made it a double; ummm where did the other patty go, in my husband's pocket?   The chili fries were bland yet disgusting with what looked like chunks in it. my husband said the all he could taste was pickles in his burger and let's not mention the zucchini fries ewww!  Not to mention when I ordered my Pastrami I asked for extra mustard and extra pickles, I got neither.  I will NEVER come back to this crap location.   The staff was rude and the food sucked, what a waste of 20.00."}
{"text":"Made a coupon for a free burger but I should pay them. Great food! I really want to try the al natural haha that looks good."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the restaurant area is always clean. My only complaint is the price but I guess that's due to everything being fresh as they say. I do recommend them, especially their salads are good."}
{"text":"The food is really good and comes out real fast. So fast as soon as i poor my drink my food is ready.  It is just pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this location since they opened, the food is always good a little pricey, they seem to have a huge turnover on employees you very rarely see the same face but most of the time the employees are freindly  we came for breakfast it was perfect but expensive $25 for 2 orders of ham an eggs"}
{"text":"The BLT and onion rings are the best!!! AND THEY HAVE FRY SAUCE (they call it thousand island, but none the less.... They have it!!!!   I also love that they repeat all the condiments that they out in your bag, at the drive through window. Nice touch-- helps me remember of I've forgotten to ask about that fry sauce!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a quick lunch.  We were seated, after a time the waitress took our order.  People kept coming in; they were getting their food, we did not get ours.  The staff just stood around; one young man wondered aimlessly around the dining room, leaving tables filthy.  Another table kept getting the wrong orders.  Still, after 40 minutes, we had not received our meal, nor acknowledgement!  We got up to go and I loudly let the manager know.  The staff just stood there like deer in the headlights.  I demanded our money back and we left.  We will never go back there.  It seems to me that the owner of this restaurant does not have a clue about how his business is run, or that he does not care.  However, if I ran my business like that, I would be OUT OF BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"The service here is great! Every time I have eaten here the staff is patient (I have an indecisive 8 year old), helpful in explaining menu items, very friendly and efficient.   The food is nothing spectacular, it's just ok. It's average \"diner\" type food, comparable to Denny's and IHOP.  The servings are typically pretty large and likely make the average person full.  It's a bit pricey though and never seems to be worth the money."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Very impressed for fast food! I would come here again! We stopped here after a long road trip from Reno. I had all 3 of my kids with me and needed something close by. Some of the best fast food I have had in a very long time"}
{"text":"When this location first opened the service was excellent.  Always greeted and helped through the entire process, credible food delivered to table.  My last experience was HORRIBLE!!  I went in with a coupon on my phone and no one could figure out how to use it correctly.  The assistant manager was unattentive and uneducated about the process.  It was the antithisis of every other experience I have had there.  The staff looked entirely new.  I called corporate to express my disappointment and was assured by the woman on the phone I would recieve a call from management.  Two weeks later.... NO CALL.  I will never eat there again and dissuade anyone I know from doing so."}
{"text":"So Im not sure what has happened with this location but the service has done a complete 180! I asked if they were under new management and the manager on duty said no, but the difference in attitude and service is day and night.   At first I thought it might have just been new cashiers on duty but nope, ive been back about 4 times each time Ive been helped by different ppl and everyone has been very pleasant and polite.   Definitely happy about the service improvement."}
{"text":"Good food, freshly made, huge portions at a great price. Only down side to them is you have to order at the counter."}
{"text":"I give it three stars. I asked for juice they gave me a bottle. I could have stop at a local gas station for that. The management could not buy orange juice all they have is pre bottles. The cashier has a Idgaf attitude. The tables are dirty. See my pictures please."}
{"text":"Awful service. Waited forever in the drive through, get my food home, they gave me the wrong order. Had to drive all the way back and the Manager at the time Morgan was neither helpful, or accommodating for their mistake and sent me on my way. Will never go back and do not recommend. To be fair though, the food was good just wish the customer service was up to par of the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The fried zucchini is the bomb and their burgers are juicy and packed with flavor. Better than Carls Jr. And Mickey Ds"}
{"text":"I ordered (2) side salads, and 1 regular salad with an egg in it.  Talk about a really good salad."}
{"text":"What kind of service is that? When I walked in this place there were almost no customers, but I had to wait for 25 minutes for my simple order. When I finally got my sandwich, it was barely worm. I'm not going there again!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. In fact, I showed up two days early hoping to try their burgers. Worth the wait? Ummm, No!  I ordered their bacon/avocado cheeseburger with their thousand island dressing on the side. I wasn't sure if I would like avocado with thousand island. Turns out-I didn't.   The burger showed up pretty quickly with no bacon or avocado on it. Since I paid for the extra items, I let them know what the problem was. The manager then comes to our table to make sure we were not hiding the bacon or avocado anywhere. Awkward!  He takes my burger back, and 30 seconds later bacon and avocado show up on my burger. I did like the bun they used-it was soft and had no sesame seeds. On the other hand, my wife ordered the standard cheeseburger with pickles and mustard only. Sesame seeds showed up on that burger? I am not sure why the difference. ..  The fries were ok-- although s little under seasoned for my liking. The onion rings tasted like leather with coating thicker than my ex-wifes makeup. No bueno!  Prices were OK , and the place was clean. One bonus was that they offer Pepsi instead of Coke!  Yay!   Still not coming back though......."}
{"text":"came here for the pastrami sandwiches, they are very large and enough for a skinny girl to have 2 full meals. The fried zucchini is a wonderful touch. It is kind of bland, but it makes you dip it in the sauce that comes with it. The pastrami is hot and moist, but not too moist where it makes the bread soggy. it was a perfect balance of bread, meat, and mustard. I will be returning to try other stuff."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd or 3rd time at Farmer Boys and different locations... pretty consistent on the food and service.  Eric got the French Toast meal and said compared to IHOP, if they were side by side he'd 90% choose FB over the competitor.  I had the hamburger, no 1000island, add fried egg with a side salad. I really enjoyed my meal. Better than in-n-out but not Fatburger, BUT more consistent than the Fat... :) Why not 5 stars? We watched the \"bus boy\" almost the entire time he was \"cleaning\" -- every table he missed a complete section. Every table. Even to the point some would still have crumbs. Then he had 2 different colored rags, which I thought meant one for the tables the other for the chairs - nope, he used either on whatever. I don't think I witnessed him clean off any of the rags between tables and he had to of cleaned off a minimum of 10 tables (4tops and booths).  Other than that we will most likely visit Farmer Boys in the future..."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place and had no idea there was a ton in Vegas.   My girlfriend and I got dinner here and were truly surprised. It took 15 minutes to get the food once we arrived at the drive through but we didnt mind.   We ate on the patio with our 8 lbs dog on the chair. The food was amazing and tasted so fresh.   I will be coming back to try breakfast!"}
{"text":"My mother and I eat here all the time, usually it's great, great food and great service until today.. My mother and I walked in, there was only one person ahead of us so we waited, when it was our turn we went up and said hello to the cashier who was actually the shift manager by the name of \"Rosie,\" she barely looked up to greet us back, so I begin ordering, and I'm vegetarian so I usually just get a sandwich and switch out the meat for cheese, been doing it since I started eating farmer boys and it's never been an issue, at this location or any other, well today it was, as soon as I asked to substitute the meat for cheese, she immediately looked up from her screen with an awful look on her face and told me she was going to have to charge me for that, I said okay no problem that's just weird because I've never been charged for it but okayy. She then started to say well who isn't charging you for it, I need their names so I can talk to my boss about that, I then informed her the store manager actually cashed me out last time, and she rolled her eyes and continued to try and argue with me about it, I said ma'am I just want my food, charge me if you need too. When she finally got done putting the order in, I realized she didn't give me both the drinks for our order, my mom then asked if she could have her drink, to which Rosie replied with an obvious very bad attitude \"the breakfast doesn't come with a drink!\" My mom then walked over to the menu and pointed out where it specifically said \"comes with small fountain drink.\" She then slammed the cup down on the counter and said \"fine, fine I will just give it to you.\" All I can say is I won't be back to this location, and Rosie the manager definitely needs training in customer service, she obviously had a very bad attitude with us from the beginning and was very argumentative even after I told her I was not going to argue with her I just want to order food."}
{"text":"A little more on the high priced side for what you get but their zucchini sticks are to die for and I crave them quite often. Great friendly service and delicious burgers and sandwiches. My husband and I eat here often."}
{"text":"A SoCal buddy of mine introduced me to Farmer Boys and I definitely dig this chain. I like the fact that it's fast food, but doesn't totally feel like fast food. You actually get food delivered to your table and employees come around to make sure you are enjoying your dining experience. Props for the Farmer Bro's.   I know this place is known for their burgers, which are definitely good, but I fancy their breakfast options. They have amazing pancakes, seriously. Fluffy, moist, you can cut them with a fork. Absolutely awesome. They also do eggs cooked to order. Last time I got my eggs over easy and they were a bit too easy for my liking, next time I'll just be safe and go over medium. They also do breakfast skillets well. From their lunch/dinner menu I fancy their fried zucchini as a side dish. Can't go wrong with one of their burgers that comes with all of the standard toppings.   As Arnold Terminato Schwartzenhogger says, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was really good. It was huge cooked well added the hot sauce packets they gave me. Bomb."}
{"text":"ok here is goes:  great food, great service, and better than denny's.  i found my new breakfast spot. my 3 eggs were cooked perfectly, the toast came warm with the butter melted on the toast, the hashbrowns ... ample amount (couldnt finish it), and my 4 pieces of bacon were not bacon bits it was the real thing. coffee fresh, really!  I will never go to denny's on cheyenne again.  ps my meal was only 5.39! (look for coupons in the mail or sign up on their website for online coupons) DEFINATELY WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Thank you Farmer Boys for replacing my meals. Went back in to try again. Only had 1 problem asked for the avacado spread on the side because didn't know if I  would like it and when our burgers came they had the spread on them. Manager replaced. From that point on everything was good. The avacado spread ended up being very good and manager said it is made fresh daily in the store. Food was very delicious. Had the Farmers burger combo. Good job of changing my opinion of your restaurant. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"For 25 bux i got a warm water jalepeno that was overcooked and rock hard and a tuna melt that was almost inedible. My gf food was of the same calibur. Long wait time too. No way stay away. First time and LAST TIME here"}
{"text":"Sorry guys not a fan.  The hamburger I ordered was a natural with avocado and bacon.   I thought the bread was on the soggy side the burger was not cooked enough it was edible but that's about it. nothing  spectacular I will not go back. staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I got a pastrami sandwich combo for lunch the combo cost 13 dollars and change ... I was very disappointed. .. the bread was so soggy the meat wouldn't stay on the sandwich.  I eat my lunch at work and I got it all over my desk .... I'm glad I got the combo I at least had fries to eat lol .... I will not be giving them any stars ..... it was not even average tasting ..... sorry but I will not be going back I have plenty of fast food restaurants that are better tasting and cost less close to my work !! They are making me do a star rating so you will be getting one star but only because I can't post without it ."}
{"text":"3+ strikes on my first visit ever made it my last.  Got in the drive-thru line about 1:20pm with 4-5 cars ahead of me.  10 minute wait which was at least 5 minutes too long but things happen.  Finally drive away with $8.00(!) hamburgers to eat in the car and we have to deal with ketchup packets.  No ketchup or mustard on the hamburgers and no mention of this by anyone.  So the worst part - cold hamburgers.  And I don't mean a little cold.  They must've been made at or prior to when I ordered them before the 10 minute wait.  One of those deals where the burger was sitting next to the lettuce so long that it wilted.  Not so impressed with the flavor.  The buns were spongy and the meat had a sooty flavor like they were cooked over a grease flame.  They probably would have been better hot.  Maybe I just I had high hopes because I heard good things about this place.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because the ingredients seemed fresh - at least at one time."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. Just avoid the drive thru drive it does take forever.  If though need it right away I suggest calling ahead and placing the order.  Seems to work out for me."}
{"text":"I would rather not give any stars to this location at all. I have given them more chances than they deserve. Since they have opened they have messed up almost all of my orders.  The worst screw ups were that last couple of times I went in. Back in Feb 2016 I stopped in to get a couple breakfast burritos and my son got the eggs and pancakes. With his order he requested both bacon and sausage...he only received sausage. Instead of breakfast burritos I received egg sandwiches. I blame myself only in part because I was in a hurry and didn't check the order before leaving the restaurant. The last, and final time, was the other night. I got the new bacon burger deal and a Harvest Salad. I received no dressing and the side with the burger was wrong. I called the manager to complain. He blamed the cashier for not giving me my dressing (he was my cashier when I went in to the store). I suggested that he have a staff meeting to retrain his employees if this is what I'm going to get every time. I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Third times definitely not a charm. Waaaay to pricey for how the food tastes. $16 for a burger with onion rings, a drink and chili cheese fries. Burger was alright but it lacked something. Onion rings looked amazing on the menu but there was literally no taste to them which was super disappointing. Chili cheese fries were good but not at $5 a pop. I did drive thru and I know I'm just nit picking but my drink was overfilled so when you stuck the straw in it flowed over the top going everywhere, boo !  Previously ordered the breakfast burrito which was really good. Maybe it's just a breakfast go to spot."}
{"text":"Went with family we all ordered breakfast! It was really good very light! The fried zucchini was huge I was not used to that! Although it was all pretty simple!"}
{"text":"I've given this place three tries and now I'm done.  The service is slow (even when the restaurant is practically empty) and the only thing that comes out hot are the fried zucchini sticks.  Burgers came out barely warm all three times.  Will not be returning.  Update: I got a generic canned email from Farmer Boys in response to my review.  They invited me to come into the restaurant to share my thoughts with the manager.  Thanks for wasting my time."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the charbroiled chicken wrap at a different location.  I was near Decatur and Charleston today, and was craving the wrap, so decided to try this location.  First off, as I was waiting in the line, one of the cashiers dropped a drink cup on the floor.  It landed upside down - with the mouth rim TOUCHING the floor.  It appeared that he just stuck it back into the cup dispenser thingy.  But maybe MAYBE there was a trashcan there that I couldn't see from my angle.  I'm not too sure.  I should've said something, but I didn't.  I ordered my CHARBROILED chicken wrap.  I was asked if I wanted fried chicken or grilled chicken.  They didn't ask me this at the other location, so my brain went into a little panic.  (I don't like unexpected questions).  The voice in my head was like, \"We want CHARBROILED chicken.\"  Did a few calculations in my head, realized grilled chicken is closest to charbroiled, so I said I wanted the grilled chicken.  Got my food to go, left, went back in to order lunch for a homeless lady, yada yada...  Okay, so I survived the Drunk Driving Convention that is obviously in town this week and made it home safely.  First thing I noticed is that my wrap was shaped like a grapefruit.  Took the paper off of it and discovered that I did receive a wrap, but it was just a big ball of stuff thrown into the middle of the tortilla, and then the edges were folded underneath.  It wasn't wrap-shaped.  Okay, whatever, no big deal.  Good things come in round packages, right?  When I took a bite, I couldn't even get thru it.  I unwrapped my wrapball to see what was going on, and I saw a bunch of hard pieces of popcorn chicken!!  Why bother asking what kind of chicken I want on my CHARBROILED chicken wrap, if you're just going to make it wrong anyways?  I live about a half hour away from this location.  It's not even worth it to drive back and complain.  I'll wait til I'm near Lamb and Craig and just go to that one.  In case you're wondering, the charbroiled chicken wrap does not taste good with popcorn chicken.  Even if they called it a \"Popcorn Chicken Wrap\" and only used the popcorn chicken pieces that are soft enough to eat, the different flavors don't go well together.  It's way too salty.    Yes, that IS what she said."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at farmer boys but this is the worst in the bunch. It's not as clean as the one on Decatur or eastern. The counter isn't as friendly or helpful. The other locations come to your table and ask if you need more coffee or need anything....not at this location. They hang out with the kitchen staff in the back.   Also steer clear of their chili cheese breakfast burrito. When you look at the ad for their new offering, the picture has a burrito filled with egg and chili and cheese. You don't really see any hash browns. Let me tell you the product is all hash brown and hardly any chili. It should be called the potatoe burrito. And I even sent it back and told them this isn't what I ordered. I told them what I ordered looks like that picture. I'm posting this because a place should show one picture and bring you a completely different looking product. They did it twice.   I will attach a picture."}
{"text":"I went in to order a burger to go. Long story sh I rt, my order was completely wrong, so I returned to have them fix the order I wanted. 20 minutes later and three employees later, I still didn't have anything. When I finally got my food, I was running late and (mistakenly( left without checking my order. I got home to realize it was still not correct.  Every person I dealt with was nice, polite and trying to be helpful,  but the bottom line is, I spent over $7 on a burger I threw away."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing visit to farmer boys.   My husband and I ordered a Cobb salad and asked for it to be split like we always have.   We also ordered fish on the side.  We then sat down at a dirty table .  As we looked around there were quite a few tables that had dirty plates on them.  It took a long time to get our food.    Sergio (team leader)brought us our food. I noticed that the salads were not split in the normal skillet style containers that we have always seen in the past and our fish was sitting on top of our salad.  I spoke to Sergio and said this doesn't look like the salad we usually have. Sergio says it is, we just don't have any skillets available at this time.  I said it looks smaller and there is no avocado on the salad.  He brought us a separate plate with avocado on it.  I asked him for a business card with his manager name on it.    Sergio (team leader) never asked us what he could do for us. He brought us the business card and left.  Poor customer service , Sergio didn't offer to fix my displeasure over the food.   The salad was half the size it normally was.   I felt like we received 2 small side salads.  I am adding pictures from this farmer boys restaurant and pictures from another farmer boys to show you the difference.   I also called in and spoke to another lead support person asking for the manager (wasn't there) then the district Mgr phone number, he said he couldn't give that out.  He never offered to give me the farmer boys 1800 customer service number. I called another farmers boys and received the 1800. Number.  I called there and left my name and number for area mgr \"Citlali\" to call me. I gave her 48 hrs and no call back.    Poor customer service.  Poor food quality.  Please see pictures."}
{"text":"Clean tables, Polite, fast and friendly service.  Excellent food!!!!!  Have eaten here several times...  No complaints"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed in the service of this particular location.  I have been to other locations and was always satisfied.  I was with a co-worker who ordered a hamburger to go and I ordered a salad to go.  His hamburger took 17 minutes before we received it. I question the time taken for the hamburger.  I was told he ordered after me, but that wasn't reflected on our receipts.  My cobb salad was missing my eggs and was half a salad.  I order these salads all the time.  I know what they are suppose to look like.  The waitress apologized and said they had new employee.  She said she noticed the salad looked different, not very much lettuce.  I replied to her, why did you serve it to me then?  She should have  sent it back to have it redone.  She asked me if I wanted to send it back.   It had already been almost 20 minutes I wasn't about to send it back now.  I was very disappointed and they have probably lost me as a customer at this location.  Their manager was helping the cook and saw me talking to the waitress for a long time and never bothered to approach me to see what was wrong.  I called another location and asked for the district manager number and attempted to call her but the number was incorrect.  Someone needs to look into the issues this location is having."}
{"text":"Over $12 for this Veggie burger combo, waited almost 10 min for my order in the drive thru. I added guacamole to my burger. $1.39??? Really??? Will never try this place ever again."}
{"text":"Wow, delicious burger and milkshake. The husband and I were looking for somewhere new to get a burger and I know I drove by here a few times but we finally stopped for a bite.  I got the Jr cheeseburger which was the perfect size for me. For a cheeseburger it had a good flavor.  Husband got a bacon boy and the bacon on it was damn tasty.  They make everything fresh to order so be patient, the wait was well worth it.   The staff is very nice.   The decor is cute, I'm not big on the country style but it was subtle and homey feeling.  The prices aren't bad either.  For his bacon boy combo with fries/large drink and my Jr cheese burger and small chocolate shake it was about 18$.   We will definitely be adding this place to our list for a  burger.   Thanks farmerboys!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for a quick bite that doesn't feel like fast food. Good burgers, fish and chips, breakfast. It's kind of an all around menu and it all tastes fresh and delicious. My favorite are the fried zucchini and onion rings. They are huge and you can get them in place of fries with a combo. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Finally a farmer boys , down the street from me. I was ecstatic when I saw that they were opening a new FB on Stephanie. Luckily I have yet to experience bad service or any other such misfortune in my past few visits. They've all been very pleasant, the service have been fast. The food has been well-prepared and the wait time has been short, also they have folks making the rounds making sure that you are content with your meal. The only thing that I have noticed is the long line at the drive-thru. However I have yet to use it."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Farm Boys in Cali, glad they put one semi-close to me. Whats great about this place is they have a little something for everyone. Also they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner items so good to have when you live in a 24/7 city. Any who I really enjoy the burgers served up over here.  I personally go for the avocado bacon cheese burger. All burgers are cooked fresh with quality 1/3 lb beef patties. You can order just the burger or make it a combo with choice of fries, onion rings or zucchini. Service is very fast and the staff is friendly. They keep the place very tidy which is always a plus. DON'T FORGET, SHOW STUDENT ID 10% OFF YOUR ORDER."}
{"text":"Good spot to grub near campus. Employees are very friendly and provide great service. The spot is usually clean, my only gripe is no student discount or yelp discount :'( the 2 other spots I frequent offer both. Oh well discounts a side still a solid place to go and visit."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes for our food (in the drive through)... Then had to come back for silverware... Food is average but EXPENSIVE!   Not coming back!"}
{"text":"While the burger is big, its not the best burger i uad. In N Out still have the best burger.  There's something about the meat i dont like. The meat taste like Butger King burger which is not a good thing. If you health cautious, dont even bother with this place."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the area! The menu is pretty big and they serve breakfast all day. The tough part is that I like their omletts and breakfast burritos equally so it is hard to choose but either one is more than enough for the average person. The people who work there are very friendly and the food comes out very quickly even when it's busy. The dishes are pretty big and are reasonably priced (they also have a military discount). My only complaint would be that this place is in a strange location...if you weren't looking for it, it is unlikely that you would just see it from the road and stop in."}
{"text":"The most disgusting food I've ever had, and I'm not picky by any means. Undercooked onion rings and zucchini fries. They also forgot part of our order but charged us. Never going back."}
{"text":"This is intended to be constructive and directed at corporate and not this location necessarily or the employees here. Service and employees are good which is why there is two stars and not one. This is the only location that I have patronized. First of all, almost 5 dollars for a giant salad with only tomatoes and one little cup of ranch is irritating. Give me some cucumbers and maybe some onions and another cup of ranch for that price. Or make it organic if you want people to pay that. The way that this place presents to me is that they are fresh and that they stand apart from other fast food and that you won't feel like you're eating fast food. But the chicken from the charbroiled chicken club was very poor quality chicken and I wish that I would've gotten Carl's Jr instead. Bacon was undercooked and chewy, took most of it out. I spent $12 and I was dissatisfied and still hungry after I ate. I don't think it was worth it. I don't mind spending it if it's worth it. Additionally, I know a lot of people really like the zucchini sticks but they are ridiculously giant and I feel like I'm just gnawing in a giant piece of zucchini. I get the whole rustic thing but I didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"do yourself a favor, and enjoy a meal at farmer boys.  great service. thank you"}
{"text":"When i am on this side of town for class this is usually my go to spot. They offer all the same fresh farmer boy goodness as all the other spots + they offer a student discount & 20% off your order of 10$ or more with a yelp check in."}
{"text":"Pretty good lil farmer boys near campus, usually a good spot to grub when i am in these neck of the woods. Finding good eats around school that are close by is quite a daunting task. However thankfully there is a farmer boys a hop, skip and jump away. This spot can range from empty to crowded depending on the lunch rush but I am still able to snag a table to chow down before my next class. Service is pretty prompt so far on my visits I have been satisfied with my meals. The only downfall is sometimes the scoundrel crowd seeps in from loitering in the parking lot but .. that happens from time to time in certain areas. As long as their not begging for my money or acting crazy I usually pay them no mind. If you are a CCSD you are eligible for a discount!"}
{"text":"I went to the new location on tropical.  We have been waiting for this burger place to open.  We went last night and it was packed.  Our onions rings were soggy and so was our burgers.  My burger was still slightly pink and not cooked all the way through.  It was pricey and i will not go back.  The service there was bad but they were so busy.  My soda had only carbonation and no dr pepper.  Very dissapointed"}
{"text":"Just ok. Nothing special. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it's a nice environment for a week day escape from the office."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be giving a restaurant franchise that I've been going to for over 15 years two stars. Normally, Farmer Boys is a favorite and I was extremely excited when they ventured out this way from Southern California. This last visit however was awful. First of all nobody seem to want to help people waiting to order food. It was a struggle to get someone to finally take our order, and the girl was extremely rude when sighing for the bill to just grab the receipt when it was still being signed. I understand being overwhelmed but don't take your frustrations out on the people who want to enjoy your establishment. Second of all, when we received our food it was cold! I have never gotten a cold burger ever from Farmer Boys. That is certainly not acceptable. It will be a while before I will return."}
{"text":"I was really sad when we pulled up. I had thought they were a diner so when I saw there was a drive thru we almost left. However, they are more like a diner and a fast food place had a baby. You order at the front just like fast food, but since it's made to order, you take a table number and find a spot while you wait for them to deliver your food. As such, the prices were really good.  As a gluten free vegetarian my options were severely limited (like they always are) but I did get fries, a side salad and a shake. The shake had real strawberries and was hands down one of the best shakes I have ever had. Fries were good, not amazing, but good. The salad, hmm, I would skip the salad. It was just lettuce and tomatoes - nothing bad, just really extraordinarily boring. Hubby had a greasy spoon type breakfast which he dug, so all was good.  I wouldn't make this a Vegas destination, but if you are headed out of town and feeling like a dork for not having eaten anything when you had options, then this place is great.  PS: They have veggie burgers :)"}
{"text":"Holy crap, what a burger.    Farmer Boys is one of my work spots, and I am so glad it is in this neighborhood.  The atmosphere is like a cross between your classic to-go burger joint, and your grandmother's house.  The food, amazing for a burger joint.  In the words of a friend of mine, \"This place killed other hamburgers for me.\"  The hamburgers here are full of taste.  Huge patties grilled to yummy perfection, and fresh veggies.  I love the one with with the guacamole, bacon, and cheese.  I try not to eat fast food, but this place makes it hard.  Farmer Boys rocks!!!"}
{"text":"The specialty burger was great. Ate for 3 and it was under $20. I recommend this place. Its a sit down restaurant with a drive through. Good service. Fresh food."}
{"text":"Went there this morning and went through the drive thru.  Only one other car in line and no one was in front of us.  Ordered the day breakfast sandwich with sausage and one with bacon.  Also ordered 2 orange juices.  We had to wait a very long time, after paying, for them to get our food to us.  Neither sandwich was wrapped properly as a good portion of each sandwich was not wrapped at all.  Finally, the sandwiches were so salty I couldn't eat all of mine. We will not go back"}
{"text":"I had been crazing fried zucchini sticks for a while so my husband decided we come here since he knows they sell them.   Upon walking in, you're greeted by staff and there was one person on each register assisting customers with their orders, so we were next in line but it took us 10 minutes until we could place our orders! And mind you, there were about 10-13 people working last night but for some reason, it looked like their flow of process wasn't working out. The girl would take the order, go to the back to wait for it and then deliver it and then come back and take our order... Kinda weird since there were some employees just standing there waiting for something to do. The girl who took our order kept repeating each order over and over until we told her she got it right the 6th time.  My husband ordered the bacon boy and I ordered the California chopped salad and fries zucchini sticks. We waited about 15 minutes until he got his order. His order came out first, then my fried zucchini sticks. The zucchini sticks were delicious- it was basically a large zucchini cut into 4s and then deep fried. It lacked a bit of salt but that was fine. When my husband finished his food, I finally got my salad which kind of sucks because the poor guy was waiting for me to finish.   The salad was good enough for 2 people to share and it came in what looks like a large mixing bowl with a hard boiled egg, cubed chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce and shredded cheese. I got honey mustard dressing on the side. I think the food was okay but everything just took forever to come out and by the time my salad did come out, I didn't even feel like eating anymore because my husband was done with his food and it didn't feel like us talking over dinner but more like me watching him eat first and now he's watching me eat like a hawk.   The girl who brought out my food also asked me if I needed dressing on my salad, I told her yes, I would like some honey mustard and she walked away and said she'd be back. I turn around a few minutes later and she is on her break, eating. So I had to ask another girl to bring me my dressing.  All in all, I think I would just come here for the fried zucchini sticks because the service was just off. There was no flow to it, people kind of just wanted to do their own thing and the food took so long to get out."}
{"text":"Holy Fried Zucchini! This is a newer location to the Centennial Hills area and I finally decided to give this place a try.  Our family has special dietary needs (vegetarians) and was not sure if this place had some options for us to try. I was pleasantly surprised they were able to accommodate the picky eaters in the family.  We went for dinner so burger and fries were calling our name but they also have some sandwiches like pastrami and chicken and they also serve breakfast. I am not sure if that is served all day though.  After finishing ordering they gave the option to half and half our side items.  I chose the zucchini and fry combo.  Holy cow! I was not expecting half logs of fresh fried zucchini.  They were huge but, also delicious.  They gave ranch for dipping which tasted like it was made fresh in house as well.  The fry's did not travel well and were slightly soggy but still edible.    The one thing I was not expecting was the prices.  I think they are slightly on the expensive side for burger and fry drive thru but the food was made fresh and to order so that is a plus. With a sandwich, fry combo, and drink your looking at $10-12 per person.    I think we will give them another try in the near future but I was looking for affordability."}
{"text":"I've been to the Farmer Boys on Eastern between Patrick & Russell which is close to my work but when I learned that this location opened close to home I was pretty happy. We decided to give this a place shot by having dinner from this place via take out. My aunt got the food but she said since it was super busy they were very slow in getting our order to her. It was a big order for a party of 5, and they did forget some stuff that I don't remember. Overall, the food never disappoints. It's always good every time I come here."}
{"text":"Worse drive thru ever I spend literally 20 minutes waiting for my food so didn't really get to enjoy my meal smh"}
{"text":"This is a very good alternative to the big fast food chains.  The food is fresh and tasty.  In particular, I like their Natural Burger, Cobb Salad, onion rings, and shakes which are made with real ice cream, thought everything is good.  The service is friendly and atmosphere nice.  I only wish they were open later."}
{"text":"How the heck does this place have 4 stars lol.    Okay so service: I went in there and the girl couldn't take her eyes off my boyfriend and only really cared and tried talking to him. She finally stopped drooling after she caught me looking at her. After that not even a glance. Nice one Sonia. While we were eating, the manager was going around checking on ketchup bottles. No \"is everything okay guys?\" Or something that shows that they care about their customers.   Anyway the food. I had a bacon cheese burger. My boyfriend got the barn burner (I think) and we both were able to compare it to Burger King. I love BK, but the fact that you can compare the two should say enough. I honestly didn't like it at all. It was really dry, the patties are so thin. I'd prefer one thick one. The fries weren't even close to crispy. \"You should've asked for extra crispy\" uh no. They should just come crispy enough.   We both won't be back."}
{"text":"Got the natural burger and fries today, Cynthia the cashier was very helpful! She also served my food and came to check on me multiple times. She did a great job for multi tasking thank you Cynthia!"}
{"text":"What is this place? Is it a restaurant? Is it a fast food joint? Is it half and half??? Hey...if it is, they got a thing going for them..  Farmer Boys serve breakfast plates, salads, sandwiches, wraps, and I guess what they're known for....burgers.  Be sure to check-in so you can redeem and use their check in offer for a cheeseburger combo at $5.49. If you don't...it would be like $7-8. Hey..doesn't hurt to save a few bucks right?  Personally, I thought these are one of the best burgers I've tasted in awhile. To sum it up, it's like a gourmet burger but in a fast food joint? If that makes sense.... My burger tasted fresh and whatever sauce/flavoring they had made  this burger stand out. (Writing this review now makes me want to go to Farmer Boys lol and this rarely happens to me when I write my reviews.)  I looked around at the other 5-6 tables and everyone else also ordered burgers and fries. But once again, if that's what they're known for and specializes in, why bother ordering anything else right?  Definitely a place I would highly recommend and I will be sure to return back soon myself."}
{"text":"Amazing zucchini sticks! Great service by all, love that my son can have a great breakfast while my fiance can have great burger, while I have an awesome salad!"}
{"text":"Farmer boys rocks, love the zucchini  Burger are the bomb  Salads are good too place is new so it's clean and nicks the employees are very nice and well mannered I recommend this place. I like the farmers burger it's the bomb natural burger is bomb  Breakfast burritos are bomb they have jalapeÃ±o and banana peppers side"}
{"text":"Drive-thru omelettes!   Ok, so it might take a bit of waiting if you order a fresh-made omelette here but it's worth it.   Had something, I think it was called hog heaven and it was a big omelette (that I couldn't even finish in one go) with ham, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns inside, with a side of your choice of hashbrowns or sliced tomatoes, and toast.     They also have kids breakfasts.  Ordered my little girl a french toast meal which came with bacon and scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Great food, order came out quick and correct. dining room is kept very clean , bathrooms as well. All of the staff was super friendly, greeting everyone as they come in. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered a cheeseburger meal with fruit and a side of zucchini sticks.  The first thing that was wrong with my order was they put my cheeseburger and fruit in the same container with the cheeseburger on top of the fruit. This made the fruit warm and made it taste like the cheeseburger (very disgusting). Then I took a bite of the cheeseburger and it was pink. I broke the cheeseburger in half to see if it was pink throughout and it was.  I am very disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I made a big mistake not read any reviews before we decided to eat here. Hard lesson learned. While *most* of the food tasted as we expected, the poor service and multiple mistakes left us feeling very disappointed when we got home with our food.   1. There wasn't anyone else in the drive threw line so we thought we'd get lucky and have quick service.....psych. Joke was on us. 20ish minutes later we had one chicken sandwich, one salad, and a kids French toast plate. Don't worry, they forgot to give us our two beverages but we were so ready to leave when they handed us our food, we didn't even realize we didn't have anything to drink untill we were pulling into the driveway - always the worst!!  2. We handed the cashier our debit card, she repeated our total back to us, then closed the class window. After a few minutes passed she came back with multiple copies of our receipt stating she wasn't sure what happened but she ran our card for the wrong order. Our total was $27, the amount we were charged was $14!! #holla #winning...or so we thought! We would have rather paid full price and had our drinks lol.  3. The charbroiled chicken sandwich and the chicken salad both booked and tasted delicious. 100% would recommend both of them. The kids French toast on the other had, lol, not so much. The food just looked sad laying on the plate. And the onion rings were gross. Straight up you think, \"WOW\" when you first see them that's how big and cool they look... blah blah blah. They taste so plain I would never order them again     Pro Tip: the ranch is to die for!! It was probably the best part of my meal! Sad, I know!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero star review. I have been waiting for 45 minutes for my order and still don't have it. Several groups of people who ordered after me have there food ."}
{"text":"Man, this place on first looks is very clean, welcoming and friendly. I had the California Chicken Club combo  with Cookies and Cream milkshake. Everything was tasty. I would  recommend this place."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  They have a menu with combo prices but yet charges you individual prices.  A 8.50 combo turned out to be 11 bucks.   How does that happen.  Lady in the drive thru said everything is individual pricing not combo pricing.  Whatever. She didn't speak English anyway.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This restaurant gives all military and Veterans a really good discount and the food is good too roxie waits on u at the counter when u come in a very nice super lady and she's funny to Bodacious place to eat"}
{"text":"The first time we went to farmer boys, we shared a burger and it was actually very good. To add to the experience they gave us a coupon for 20% off so we are definitely going to come back. Second visit did not go as well. I forgot what kind of burger I had before so I ordered what I thought I got, took off the cheese, added mayonnaise, and order the onion rings instead of fries. But I'm your rings are so big it doesn't even seem like an onion ring. The Fridays that I ordered from my phone of have no seasoning on them at all. The burger that I thought I got before was like a really bad decision. The Bun is so thick and I think it's a potato bun. But we also got a grilled chicken sandwich, Not so good either. Why waited in line for about seven minutes for fresh food. The food was hot because it was already after 11 but there needs to be better seasoning on this food."}
{"text":"I want to like Farmer Boys. I drove through and it took about 20 minutes from start to finish and I found that rather long. I ordered a Cobb Salad and the guy taking my order said they were out of that choice. That seemed odd so I went with a BLT, drink and onion rings. Everything tasted great, was hot and fresh. It seemed odd to me that the sandwich was not cut in half so I will make note of that in the future when I go there to ask them to cut it in half. Is it just me? LOL It's also hard to handle in the car when it's a whole sandwich vs. a half at a time. The bacon on the BLT was great it was sticking out of the sides of the sandwich and I have to compliment the gal the served me as she asked me if I wanted any ketchup or sauce and I said no and she said, ever so sweetly \"Are you sure you don't want to try our homemade Ranch? It's really good!\" and so I took her up on it and she was right, it was tasty. It's nice to have a new burger place in town and I think, I'm not sure because it did not say on the drive through menu board even though I looked and looked, but I think breakfast is served all day/night - if that is the case I'm trying a breakfast next time because they choices look wildly awesome. It's seems to be a fresh addition to our normal lunch/dinner options thanks for being in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I think that this Resteraunt has decent food and a decent and clean dining area. The food is good, and the prices aren't horrible. I love the zucchini sticks ! But most of all, if you like farmer bros on Facebook you get a free brownie! I'm just sayin'!!!!"}
{"text":"I like their salads the Cobb salad is my favorite the only thing I don't like is the long wait at the drive thru if you are at your lunch hr you might want to think twice going there because you might be late I was there waiting almost 1/2 hr. It was rediciolus that they make you wait that long. Other then that the food is very good"}
{"text":"Had my first Farmer Boys experience at the new location on Stephanie St.  I guess my expectations were too high.    I don't think the burgers tasted any different from Carl's Jr. which I stopped eating at years ago.  The fries are OK and the big onion rings are flavorless.  My friend had the chicken sandwich which turned out to be the pressed chicken.  He thinks that the food quality has gone down the tube from where they used to be years ago.   So now I guess I just keep going back to my other favorite burger place and forget this one."}
{"text":"Best Farmer Boys I've been to. Freshly prepared food, friendly staff and super clean. A little off the beaten path but worth the extra drive time."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy are the only thing I've eaten here and they were bomb. I've never had them outside of a hotel, and man do they taste different when theyre fresh!"}
{"text":"Great service from the moment we walked in. We were greeted by the cashier and took our order in a very upbeat, yet professional manner. I like the fact that he even stated where Farmer Boys originated from, which means he was paying attention at orientation or read up on the history. Wish I could remember his name.  The server was also very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"The only restaurant that reminds me of Cali . The onion rings are the best .. Ppl there are very nice n treat u so good I just can't complain n food is delicious .. U just have to take a look for your self .. Even my 1 1/2 year old son ate food he loved the fries n this place makes by far the best fries .. Thanks to yelp I found this place .. This place is kinda far but it's totally worth the drive .. Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"Farmers boys is just one of those early morning breakfast places to go to now, it really has substitute for Denny's or IHOP. I gotta say I used to go to them places before but I can honestly say I don't recall the last time I was at one. There's just something about this place, people here are very cool and friendly, their breakfast is always great!!! Plus I really love their French toast. I'm not saying or taking anything away from those other breakfast places I mention earlier, but I just don't really care for them much....sorry but I just don't like waiting in line or having to sit down and wait for a table for 20-30 min. Just to get my order another 20 minutes later. I think there's a few of you out there that know exactly what I'm talking about. Here I just come in and order and my food gets done fresh and don't have to wait 40 minutes to eat. I love this place and the only reason why I gave it 4 stars it's because I gotta drive a bit to get here. But believe me it's well worth it."}
{"text":"We normally love farmers boys. We were spoiled at south Decatur. At this location, the bathrooms were dirty, no paper towels. ALL our food was cold and over cooked and under cooked. My toast was not toasted and I had to go up and ask for a coffee refill.  The employees were friendly enough, but we will NEVER eat here at this location again!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered drive thru an hour before closing. Nobody in the drive thru or restaurant and they still got my order wrong. Hot chicken Sandwich was barely room temp. Zucchini fries that I ordered were no where to be seen. Instead I got cold French fries! This location is a JOKE!!!"}
{"text":"Had to stop here since im on a short trip and not visiting my home in Socal. The food was delicious as expected. Char broil bugers taste fabulously good."}
{"text":"At here for lunch the other day, and left feeling very satisfied.   Came here on a quick lunch break with a co-worker after he had seen it on his way to work. Upon parking, knew the place was going to be packed from just amount of cars in the parking lot surrounding it.   Be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes for your food (we only had a 30 min lunch break) , 5 of that waiting in line, and another 10-15 waiting for your food. Did not expect this many people to be swamping the place at 1230. Our entire visit was about 40 minutes after everything was said and done.  I snagged a table as soon as we walked in (which is a great idea) while my coworker ordered.    The menu I could see from the table had so many tasty, delicious options, and I can understand why it's a popular breakfast and lunch spot. I don't believe they are open for dinner I think I read somewhere.   I ordered the Avocado, mushroom 1/4 lb. Burger and it was totally worth the wait! The meat was juicy, the avocado & vegetables fresh, the mushroom was delicious and the fries were a nice skinny, long cut which made the crunchy start to finish. Th bun was a very good non-standard bun that didn't taste like a generic bun. Washed it all down with a pop and I was good to go.   Place was clean, staff was nice, and I'll definitely come back again.  Cheers!  ~MikeB"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru after football practice. The menu looks kind of overwhelming if your used to the traditional fast food joints. The service is pretty standard, nothing too crazy to get excited about. I like how they give you your food in a box instead of a giant bag. That way everything stays upright and in order. The burgers were a good buy, but you gotta eat them sooner rather then later because they will get soggy quick. Ok service, and standard food earns this spot an easy 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I ever had, my father and I have given this place 3 chances which have all ended in failure. 1) the burgers are not made to order, they are dry as a burnt piece of toast 2) the mangers seem to be a know it all.  We went in and ordered the fish and chips and the broccoli cheddar soup. We got our soup only to find that not only did it have a slim like texture but both my father and I ask for the manager. They only question that was asked was; \"what kind of cheddar do use?\" The manager said that they use yellow, so if that's the case then why is it green? She then made a comment that because broccoli is green the soup will be green. We told here that's not the issue, the issue was that the soup was no good. We asked if we could exchange the slime soup for the New England clam chowder.  This is where the she dropped the ball, she brings out soup and just walks away. And to my surprise a watered down broken up chowder soup. I asked for the manager again asking when was the soup made, she assures me that it was made fresh in the morning. That is when we called her out on her bullshit. She made a comment to my father saying that he doesn't know what he's talking about. I cut her off and told that my father has worked as an executive chef for 26+ plus years, and that I've been a casino main kitchen cook for 5 years. I told here that the chowder was made a few say ago. I told here I've made 50+ gallons of not only clam chowder but many different soups to the point that I know if the product is made fresh or just a reheat.  I've already contacted their corporate office.  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK"}
{"text":"First time here today , 25 minute wait for two burgers and onion rings, food was almost cold and definitely soggy from sitting around....."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.I though 7.50 was a little high just for a burger,but it was huge and I could barley finish it.It was actually really good and I loved the avacado on it."}
{"text":"Greasy bacon, ham dry and over cooked, eggs looked anemic, hash browns look like frozen ones you buy at store.   Lol@ anyone giving this 5 stars, 4 and 5's are the places you bring family and friends to, so you can wow them.   Came here for breakfast and only a tiny bit better than Denny's"}
{"text":"Food always tastes fresh, and is always served fast (without being typical fast food).  I usually go for their veggie burger, because it is thee best one I've had in Las Vegas. And the peculiar thing is, there's nothing fancy about it; it is your basic hamburger/cheeseburger set up, but whatever they use to make their veggie patties is so wonderful and delicious, that I can't help myself. Their fried zucchini is also amazing, not to mention you get a HUGE serving for a great price (honestly, plan to split this side with at least one other person). Their shakes are great to try as well (I usually go for the cookies and cream).   Environment is clean, kept cool during these Vegas heatwaves, and the staff has always been super friendly.   Oh, and if you're satisfied with your visit, don't forget to ring the bell on your way out!"}
{"text":"This was hard to rate because there are so many contradictions. The food is always fantastic, but I do not think they have ever gotten my order right. The wait is long, but that is because it is really more of a fast restaurant than a typical fast food chain, which is the reason the food is so much better. Long story short, I still love them, even though the wait is significant and the orders are rarely correct."}
{"text":"Ok. It IS fast food. But it is the best fast food in the world! And I received the most awesome customer service. I was THAT customer, asking a thousand stupid questions and they just smiled as they answered each one. They were just plain nice. and can we talk fried zucchini for a moment? Huge battered sticks, perfectly breaded and seasoned, dipped in creamy ranch.  Seriously, they need to do this with all vegetables. Great place."}
{"text":"We always stop by here on the way out of town, got the breakfast special,a great deal- under $15 for 2 with drink, service was good and restrooms clean and tidy.coffe was hot and tasty. We will be back!"}
{"text":"15 minute wait for a to-go order for a single burger. The restaurant was empty, save 3 people. The only reason I got my burger at the 15 minute mark was because I had to approch the counter and ask what was going on. It seems the burger was ready and just sitting there in the bag for a while. It would be one thing if it was busy in there, but it was dead!  I had been alternating between this place and Habit Burger the past few weeks, but I think I'll just go to the Habit Burger on Blue Diamond in the future when I need a burger fix.  1 star.  No mas for me."}
{"text":"Well we come here at least one a week. The service is always amazing. Friendly and polite. Food is so good for fast food. My hubby got the Denver only with cheddar. It was made perfect. I don't eat meat I got hash browns and toast perfectly made. Always good! Eat here so much better than McDonals! And real food!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at this restaurant twice a month.  Tonight was an awful experience.  I had a coupon which no one could figure out how to ring up.  Then I was told my order had to be rung up separately because of the coupon.  Because of the two orders I had two receipts.  The loyalty program won't let you enter two receipts for the same visit.  I was cheated out of those points.  I also ordered coffee.  They forgot to bring it to me until my dining companion asked.  All in all the service was lousy on this occasion.  The food was good, but not worth the hassle to get it."}
{"text":"The West Charleston and Decatur location is where I usually go. The service is very good, the employees are friendly and helpful and the food is VERY good. I have many choices of places to eat but I go here quite a bit because it is close, and fast food becomes boring. I would have given it a five star except that it is a bit unclean around the edges (floors, fixtures, lights, booths) that could be improved easily."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was underwhelming. I wanted a quick breakfast so I decided to stop at Farmer Boys. I ordered the \"Biscuits and Gravy Bowl\" not know exactly what to expect because they don't have full descriptions on the drive-thru menu.  Pros: The biscuits were big and tasted freshly made. The gravy was also good (not great) and tasted freshly made. The portion size was generous. The biscuit and gravy bowl also included scrambled egg and one piece of sausage.  Cons: The biscuit and gravy bowl only included one piece of sausage. It was pricy! $7.45 (including tax) should include more sausage. The sausage was burnt*. The entire thing was SMOTHERED in gravy. Don't get me wrong, I like gravy, but just because they served this in a bowl doesn't mean it should resemble soup.  *I'm sure burnt sausage isn't normal, but it's what I got today.   So, to summarize, the food was good not great. It was over priced and the breakfast was assembled with WAY too much gravy.  I doubt I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yuck !!!! Won't be back worst hamburger I rather go in out burger or smash burger !!! Customer service suck"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to  this location I have been disappointed both visits.  This  location is brand new and I understand their help may not be up to standards but when I asked for onion rings to be cooked well done I even verified with the lady taking my order    I expected the onion rings to be well done these clearly are not cooked as I requested  Cooking Big Onion Rings to a crispy well done is not rocket science!!  The burger was not great .... I've had better at both of the other locations on Decatur and the one on Eastern Avenue  Farmer  Boys  get your game on ...  or it's a no go for me!!"}
{"text":"Customer Service is Awesome ... they addressed my complaint in a timely manner.  Yes I was disappointed in the looks of the burger we received - it did taste good - I was calling attention to details on the advertising versus the finished product  We are going to return for another visit to see if it was just the kitchen staff having a lapse in quality due to the place being busy... Thanks !!"}
{"text":"Framer Boys reached out tio discuss my dissatisfaction and I feel confident they will resolve the issue and stick to high standards    Extreme Bacon Boy Burger  It's a huge disappointment... burger looks nothing like the TV ad  Quality of this place is gone way down we're not sure we will go back - there are plenty of places to go."}
{"text":"I used to work around this place and the food was discounted so I was totally down but some of it wasn't very flavorful. My favorite order was the chili bread bread bowl (which is only seasonal) and a Reece's shake. Those I would give 5 stars but anything else I've had I pile on the ketchup or pepper.   Don't take the drive thru if you're trying to get somewhere quick. This isn't a fast food place and I'm not sure why they have a drive thru, convenience maybe, but it just took to long for me.   Staff here is really cool through, they have probably change since I've been but the management was always nice and the shift managers would always give me a free cup for my drink so I would hook them up when they came to my place."}
{"text":"I love farmer boys for their burgers. Today I got a breakfast plate and it was also good. However, I regret choosing sausage as a side. The sausage tasted like I was biting into a lard patty. Straight oil and fat. I could feel the oil leakong as i took a bite. I couldnt keep eating it. Next time I'll get bacon."}
{"text":"Ridiculous prices and the drive thru takes forever! I just waited 20 minutes in the drive thru for a kids meal that I paid $7.24 for. The burger was ok. The fries were so under-done that we didn't even eat them."}
{"text":"I have had different experiences here. While dining in, it was pretty good. Hot, fresh, nothing amazing but for a quickie, A-OK  After that experience, we decided to order a company lunch. That, sadly was a very different experience. All I can say is THANKS TO SOFIA, she made everything much better than it actually was! Farmer Boys is lucky to have an employee like that!  We ordered lunch for 12 - to go. All of the salads were perfect! The burgers and sandwiches, not so much. Most were wrong. kinda cold and rubbery, and generally pretty lackluster. And we had to drive back to get a sandwich they had forgotten.   People ate it, because they were stahhhhving, but the consensus was, this would be the \"to go salad\" place!   Lesson learned.  Save this place for when we are eating in, NOT for large to-go orders.  Because the \"to-go\" got up and went in the WRONG direction!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch and were pretty impressed with the burgers though definitely not the fries.  The burgers are large and cooked to order.  I got one with guacamole and could only eat half of it.  The meat seemed like it was fresh, not frozen.  They're messy but worth it.  The fries, on the other hand, were horrible.  I don't know if the same oil is used to fry other food, i.e. fish, but the fries had a faint fish taste to them.  NOT good!  Maybe it was time to empty the frying vat and refill the oil but either way, fishy fries are not my thing.  The tables around us were all having breakfast and when I go back I will for sure try that.  It looked great!   I will say that the menu offered a TON of things so there's something to please everyone.  And a nice touch was the hand delivery of food to the table.  It makes you feel like you're in a place that's a notch above the typical fast food joint.    Definitely would recommend but beware of the fries!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and we both ordered tuna melts. We waited and waited.  We went up to the counter to inquire about our order after about a half hour, we were told that they were extremely busy but our order would be out shortly.  After another 15 minutes we went to the counter again to ask, they said it would be right up.  5 minutes later the counter person came to our table and said the order never got made because they were out of tuna.  He did offer us our money back, but our lunch hour was over and we did not have time to go elsewhere.  I called to speak to a manager after the incident and he said he would get back to me.  Never heard from him."}
{"text":"Standing here right now. It's 6pm on a Friday and only 2 people are working, one of them so new she can't do anything without the other. They didn't greet anyone coming in. Now after ordering on the phone 20 minutes ago it appears I will be waiting for everyone backed up in line before they even acknowledge me. Not worth the time. They have gone downhill majorly. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The customer service here is fantastic and the food is always great! They're great with customizing my order each time I'm there and I love that they have a few vegetarian options. I go to this location so often that the employees know my order and it just makes the experience even better!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a place like this before.  It's like a cross between fast food and sit down dining. So, you order at the counter, but they bring you your coffee in a ceramic mug and bring you your food and silverware, but you have to bring your plate and what not to the receptacles. Odd.  I wasn't provided a tray so getting things to the receptacles could have been awkward if I had more dishes or if I were there with my kids.   Anyway, the food and service was pretty good.  Everything was cooked and presented very well.  The orange juice was fantastic!  If I had a complaint it would be that the coffee is very weak and of poor flavor.    I'd go back."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is in between fast food and a traditional restaurant. The large dining area and plenty of tables/booths make you feel like you can take a break and relax for awhile instead of gobbling down your meal.  Be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes for your meal to be brought to your table.  Food is fresh so it is worth the wait.  They serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious, the onion rings are da bomb, just wish there prices were a little more reasonable,  would eat there more. It's more of a a splurge than an frequent eat spot."}
{"text":"The clam chowder is amazing and the portions are huge.  The staff was very patient and friendly while we asked all our questions about the menu.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ehhh? Just so so, Like kind of going to wendys but they bring your food to you . Only reason I tried it was from a friends reccomendation and he must have been hung over that day that he thought it was so great ?"}
{"text":"Just stopped by to have a drive thru breakfast burrito and was very disappointed how horrible the food was cold raw potatoes no sausages very little and cut so small and expensive we ordered 4 burritos and jump back on the fwy. I will never again eat at farmer boys."}
{"text":"In our ongoing search for biscuits and gravy in the City of Sin, we decided to try this cross between a Denny's and a Carl's Jr.  They have about 60 locations in Southern California and a few starting here.  They claim to have great burgers, and they are also known for breakfast.  Very homey dining area, clean, not busy for a Sunday morning, decent service, not friendly but okay.  Nice ceiling mural acknowledges the proximity to the Air Force base, a little incongruous with the country setting.  You place your order at the counter, get a number, seat yourself and they bring the food to you. Loved the coffee and the continuous refills in a real diner-style china mug - a little expensive at about 1.50 per serving but a nice smooth breakfast blend.  The gravy on the biscuits had a nice amount of crumbled sausage, and definitely used the drippings so lots of taste and plenty of pepper, the way I like it.  The biscuit was not great, though, not very thick, not flaky, like a large round flat disc.  I saw they also have a Strawberry Dessert Biscuit and I can't imagine it standing alone without the gravy.  On the expensive side also for what it was, $2.79.  Better than McDonalds, not as good as I hoped it would be, so I'm still looking.  I saw several people eating salads, sandwiches and malts, this was at breakfast time on Sunday, so I'm guessing they do full menu all the time they are open.  Based on the other reviews, I'll try again and hope for better luck at lunch."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is a nice place to sit and eat.  It is a weird themed restaurant, but the food is good.  I hate the fact that I can see the caloric intake next to every menu option, but it helps me choose the right foods, or at least the lowest calorie intake for my meal. If you want to eat hormone-free burgers, stop in."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened their customer service is always great the food  is always fresh to order and delicious the fried zucchini is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Other than being served pretty cold (through the drive thru), the food wasn't that bad.  Would have been way better warm though."}
{"text":"I probably will never get drive/thru ever again. I have been many times and they have never gotten my order right. I once got a chicken sandwich with no chicken!! I ordered avocado chicken sandwich and after I ordered they didn't have avocado, okay then give a discount for the extra charge for the avocado. They wouldn't! So we gave them 2 dollars less then what the total was and they said I guess I can give you a discount. When we got home all the sandwiches didn't have any sauce or dressing and no bacon. I'm sorry but no more for me. And the food is ALWAYS cold!"}
{"text":"Manager was super nice, food was Farmer Boys fresh. They need to put diaper changing tables in bathrooms and get a few more high chairs."}
{"text":"My buddies back in California have been telling me for sometime about this joint called Farmer Boys.  They keep saying how great it is and as a fast food connoisseur, it was definitely on my list the next time I made it back there.  Well much like finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans, I was driving down Decatur in part of town I rarely roll to and lo and behold, there was a Farmer Boys staring me in the face.  Waiting was no longer needed.....it was go time!  The place was epically busy during lunch, which is a good sign.  I ordered the Farmer Burger which is a half pound burger with cheese, bacon and avocado (got to go with the namesake) and made it a combo.  I duly paid up and when the transaction was complete I asked for my cup for a soda, the gentleman taking the order was like \"Oh you wanted a combo, I didnt ring it up as such.\"  I said no problemo, I'll pay the difference, but he was insistent that it was his fault and that he'd take care of it.  I felt bad and wanted to pay but he wouldn't let me so I put what it would cost me into the tip jar.  I thought that was a nice, albeit really unnecessary, customer service gesture.  Not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.  As for the food, the burger was outstanding.  One of the better fast food burgers I have ever had.  The bacon was crisp, the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.  I struggled to finish the whole thing, which is a rare occurrence.  The fries were good but relatively unspectacular.  I wish the fries were top notch because I would not hesitate to give Farmer Boys a 5 star ranking in that case.  Although, there is hope.  The menu is extensive and I have barely scratched the surface with this matinee performance.  When I make my return, there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakfast menu which is served all day (awesome!) and intriguing salad and wrap options too.  So basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening salvo, while further visits will reveal the true nature of this place.   Prices were decent, especially considering the quality of the ingredients.  Service was friendly and the dining atmosphere was kitschy, rustic, farmy fun.  I also respect that they rock the drive-thru as well so if that REO Speedwagon song I'm rocking too is just to good to turn off, I can keep the party going without missing a beat.  Now if I can only figure out more reasons to go to this stretch of Decatur....."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  I LOVE their zuccini sticks!   They usually have a \"check in\" offer here on yelp.  Variety of different foods, sandwiches, salads, burgers, chicken, breakfast.....something for everyone.  If you leave here hungry it's your own fault"}
{"text":"Average food at best. I ordered the Bacon Boy combo. I only managed to eat about half of my burger before the saltiness just became overwhelming. The fries were luke warm and completely saltless.  Service was good as the young guy working the floor was attentive and did his best to help as my son's order was wrong and had to be remade twice."}
{"text":"My vegetarian wife, loves this place, she could eat their veggie burger, \"the market\", everyday if she could.    Now, with that said, this place had a horrible and inattentive staff. Also, this is one of the few place on earth I will eat that exclusively carries Pepsi products, I always bring my own coke...   I always get the bacon boy and it never fails to satisfy...   Note: the fried zucchini is highly recommended by everyone, but I have to say, they are very over rated. Too much zucchini, not enough fried goodness, I suggest getting fries..."}
{"text":"The patty melt was good...took 22 minutes for them to have it ready from cash out to it being brought to the table.  Maybe they had to go catch the cow and make the cheese??? Lol"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Cust svc is excellent  Food was amazing and definitely on point and HOT HOT......  Great job job team!"}
{"text":"Any place that can serve a good breakfast all day gets my good vote. So excited to go here for dinner after my brunch fail this morning. I already decided before I walked in that I was going to get eggs anything! Except I walked in and saw posters for all their soups. With it being could ouside this changed my mind. I ended up getting their chili which the casher told me was made in house and pretty popular there. I can see why. Pretty yummy. (i just have to remember next time to go easy on the cheese topping.) My mom had some heartattack on a plate. (so you know it was good!) hashbrowns, topped with country gravy, layered with scrambled eggs, and topped off with pieces of chicken tenders. are you craving it yet for breakfast tomorrow? you should be! I had a bite of my boyfriends bacon cheeseburger and that was even good. We shared chili cheese fries (like my bowl of chili wasn't enough right??) and I didn't think they were going to be such a large order! We ended up taking so much home for leftovers of everything. For 4 people to eat dinner it only came to 25 dollars. My dads credit card isn't complaining. Hey farmer boys! you left me impressed and very full. I'll be back to check out some breakfast burritos soon, just maybe for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here, as I had heard good things about it. As luck would have it, I was driving by this location as I was driving between work locations, it was a creative route, but it worked.  I looked over the menu and decided on a cheeseburger, makes it easy to rate against other places. I had the Big Cheese combo. It was a cheeseburger, side and drink at $8.31 with tax.  The place is like Carl's Jr in that you order at the counter, they give you a number for the table and they bring your food when it's ready. That's the only thing that reminds me of Carl's Jr here.  The burger was good, it is a 1/4 pound patty, the patty is thinner and larger diameter than most 1/4 pound burgers. The shape of the patty seemed to have helped, it had retained a bit of juiciness after cooking, and the thinness had kept it from being tough. (With thicker burgers, in order to get the middle well done, the outsides are over done, so I kind of like the thinner burgers) The burger came with onion, lettuce, tomato, thousand island dressing.  For the side you get the choice of fries, onion rings or zucchini sticks. I misread the menu, I thought it said, small fries or 2 onion rings or 2 zucchini sticks. I choose onion rings. When my meal arrived it had 4 onion rings, I thought I had scored. But after further review, the side list for the combo said a choice of two, so since I had just picked onion rings it was two orders of two onion rings. I could have had two onion rings and two zucchini sticks, or fries and onion rings, you get the idea. Back to the onion rings, they were huge, I am guessing the onion slice was 1 inch thick, and very tasty. I believe they are made fresh with a unique batter, certainly don't taste frozen.  The soda is the Pepsi genre. I like cherry colas and they had cherry Pepsi, so that was nice. I had just come in from 104 degrees outside, so it was refreshing.  I liked the food. Certainly better than most fast food places. I will go there again, I want to try the patty melt, I noticed it after I had ordered, it's not under burgers, it's under sandwiches. It was my first time there, I know better now."}
{"text":"Not bad. A bit pricey for a drive through joint but the food was good. The decor was nice inside, gives you that small town feeling. If I'm ever in the area I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed with our food. No flavor on the chicken sandwiches, food did not taste fresh.  On top of everything a chicken combo is $12."}
{"text":"They will never, ever get your order right, and will argue with you about it and make you show receipts to prove you didnt get what you ordered. However, it is the best fast food that you can pick up early in the morning, so you just have to decide if its worth the trouble. PS: If you want a hamburger, get the natural one-- the patties on the other burgers are absolutely disgusting, but the natural burger is actually pretty good. Good luck!!  Update: went back again today, the employee taking my order was irritated at how many times i asked her to repeat my order back to me, yet it STILL came out wrong. There is just something wrong with the way they do things. It's slow and always incorrect.  Update 2: after a month or two of not going at all, because the food was starting to make my family sick, we gave it another shot (don't ask me why, lol) and the orders were all wrong, as always, and it made us all sick again. This restaurant should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"Very good cheeseburger. Even got the yelp special that popped up on my phone. Loved the fresh veggies on the burger, very tasty. The onion rings were huge. My coworker had the chicken salad, she said it was wonderful..i would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I went to Farmer Boys expecting it to be a great burger place.  I believe their menu says something to the effect of \"World's greatest burger\".  In my humble opinion, it was most certainly not.  There were some surprises and some letdowns.  First, let's talk about this burger.  I got the Farmer Burger since it was my first time there.  I really liked the fact that it came with all of the usual burger toppings and also had avocado.  The burger patties themselves were the disappointing part.  If you're not In-N-Out, I'm kind of over the thin patty thing.  If this is the world's greatest burger, I'm looking at it like I'm looking at my new friend at the nude beach, I want to be impressed by the meat.  Sadly at Farmer Boys, I was not impressed.  The reason this review is three stars instead of two is for the sides.  I got the onion rings and the crispy zucchini.  The onion rings had a good batter and were quite large so the small order of only 4 rings wasn't really an issue.  The zucchini was surprise.  One small order of the crispy zucchini is literally a whole plant quartered and fried in the same batter as the onion rings.  Impressive, yes...practical, perhaps not.  I would have preferred a thinner cut so that they were actually crispy, but I did like the fact that it was a generous portion.  The service was standard, and someone did come around the entire restaurant at one point and ask how everyone's meal was and offered to get guests anything they needed."}
{"text":"Nothing special but quick reasonable low priced. Tried the drive through only once because I was close and in a hurry. I'd recommend to give them a try if needing a quick low priced meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Farmer Boys.  The service was fine, the fries were good, but the burger was disappointing. Granted, I got the Big Cheese, their basic burger, but this was not the award winning burger I had heard about.  The lettuce and onion were fresh and the bun was okay, but the burger patty was a thin hockey puck.  My wife had the chicken avocado sandwich, which she liked.  Her side was zucchini , which was bland and unwieldy."}
{"text":"This location is about the same as the locations in CA, clean inside and nice interior design. The food is good and reasonably priced. The staff was friendly. I'll eat here again if I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time at Farmer Boys. Pulling into the parking lot, I was not impressed with Torrance's choice for lunch. I ordered a cheeseburger combo and was surprised to see how big the burger was! It was yummy. The staff was really friendly and the manager even came by to see how our meal tasted.  I also like that the menu shows the amount of calories for each item. I will return."}
{"text":"Great service, really good food, and farm fresh.  The burgers are really good, definitely worth more than one visit... and that it is farm fresh makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"I love burgers but was extremely disappointed with the All Natural 1/3 lb cheeseburger that I got today.   I opted for Swiss Cheese. Neither the burger nor the cheese seemed to be high quality, something I expect from a sandwich that runs over $5.  The burger had no flavor and the Swiss seemed to be a fake cheese. As a cheese lover, I expected true Swiss flavor from a place that advertises all natural and this was clearly not.  Had I know that, I would have gotten processed American. I don't eat fried food so I can't review the sides, but would not recommend when there are so many opportunities for a better burger in Vegas.  4.99 gets you a burger and fries at any Stations Casino cafe and those are flavorful burgers."}
{"text":"Went out for my lunch break decided on a salad,  I ordered at 1:33 PM per my receipt I have waited a total of 30 minutes for a SALAD. This is unacceptable . it has grilled chicken on it ! that seriously what I'm waiting for, with it being a to go item how is it 4 vehicles went through the drive thru and one car even ordered salads!  I will be deleting the app and will not go back to this restaurant as I will never invite anyone to try it either!"}
{"text":"Great, huge portions, wonderful staff. Courtney was amazing with us. Definitely will be back for the good food and mellow atmosphere."}
{"text":"I come here frequently as it's near my workplace.  The staff is always hospitable and friendly.  It pays to do the VIF program if you come here a lot.  Good for lunch breakfast or dinner.  Breakfast burritos are perfect!  Mitzi is very kind with guests."}
{"text":"So I came in to this restaurant thinking it be exactly like the ones from home. But nothing like California farmer burgers. I order a jalapeÃ±o burger thinking it be as advertises but so wrong was missing lettuce, tomatoes, onions and not to mention their register people should be more welcoming and be able to offer something different. Or be greeted with would you like to try , so this will be last time I come here"}
{"text":"I haven't had farmer boys since I lived in California.  That's 6 years ago. Had it just now. Wow!. It was so good. The food actually looks like the picture and tasted amazing. Will definitely come back again. Not 6 years from now. Place is clean, people were cool nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very impressed customer service  was fantastic food was good as well.."}
{"text":"Always a great dining experience. The food is fresh and delicious. The staff is fast and friendly the manager cynthia is definitely doing something right. My favorite farmer boys by far."}
{"text":"Got a breakfast Burrito with bacon & sausage. Excellent except the salsa wasn't that good"}
{"text":"It's pretty cheap. I always get a day break with bacon, but today I tried the Breakfast burrito instead.  Staff is friendly, love the atmosphere here. It can be loud at times when it's busy. Sign up for their emails and you might get a good coupon!  I love their small Vanilla Milkshakes too."}
{"text":"The cheeseburgers, fries and zucchini were fast, fresh and tasty.  They just opened but food and service were excellent.  For a party of 8, the total was about $68 which included several shakes.  Shakes are only a $1 more when you get a combo!  I'm sure some of the early comments were from when they just opened and there were lines out the door. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys has been a \"I wanna go eat there\" place for the longest time for me! I finally decided to give in last week when my co-worker insisted we go! Now because I have been really staying away from so much beef I ended up doing a salad because again this is one of the recommendations I received from multiple people. This location isn't hidden but it's on some weird cross streets of Russell/Decatur. We decided to place a phone order instead of dining in since time was running short! I walked in and the manger looked like the only one running the front counter. I let him know my name and wow our order was ready! Now I'm not sure if I should be ready to throw confetti and praise them for this because let's be real how long and difficult is It to prepare two salads? Either way I lked the customer service and the location itself seemed pretty clean. They have this yummy looking breakfast burrito that I will for sure be stopping by in the near future to try out! For two salads only costing us under $20 I would say it was a deal! Most places charge anywhere from $11-20 depending on what kind of salad you get and what you choose for toppings! Overall I was pleased! Hopefully I can stomach doing a burger so I can update the review and let everyone know if that too was as good!"}
{"text":"Huge onion rings and crispy zucchini.  Very good food.  Everything is freshly made and the prices are good.  Plan on trying the breakfast menu next time because it is served all day."}
{"text":"This place is SO AMAZING!!!! I have passed it many times before and finally decided to stop. The food is so fresh and amazing. I love the club sandwich, the zucchini side and the bread bowls ! I want to try everything on the menu. The drive thru person is always very nice and it's worth the extra few minutes in the drive thru line. They are making quality food!"}
{"text":"This place loves up to the name. The service was excellent. The manager came by and checked on us. The food was excellent!! Sausage patties were the best I have had. The burger was a little small which is why moat of them have 2 patties so order one with 2 patties if you are hungry. The veggies and fruit was fresh and the place is clean!! Forget the chains, this place is awesome for the price and concept."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is delicious! Great price and generous portions. Their California Omelette is superb. Fresh food, made when you order it. If you haven't been here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you've gotta try it! This location has super friendly staff, and clean! The bell is always rung when we leave!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this one, yet, but will definitely be going as Farmer Boys in one our favorites, but have always been so far away from home. I will follow-up with my review on this location after visiting and my fingers are crossed it is good!  I just went to their website and saw they do have coupons.  One coupon was worth $5.99 for The Big Cheese Mixed Combo.  Just an FYI! (Coupons are located under \"Promotions\"."}
{"text":"YES!  Actually found this place on Yelp, took the advice and headed over for dinner one night.   And, so GLAD we did!  Just a terrific burger is all I can say, and the fries were very good!  We wanted go back again, but never made it.  Lucky for us we will be moving there in a couple of months so will be able to visit more often.  LOVED the decor!  Anything like a farm with chickens and other farm animals works for me!  See you soon, Farmer Boys!"}
{"text":"Really beginning to wonder why I don't come here as often as I should. Many times I'm in the go and wanting fast food this is actually what I want, real food that's fast! I usually come here for the breakfast burritos, which are constantly delicious, today I had the sourdough chicken club added Dijon! Yum, the breast, juicy and tender as all breast should be. Yes I'm talking chicken. The bacon, crispy, but still bacon, not chips! The tomato, ripe. Last the fries crisp to perfection. Couldn't beat $7 ( saved $5 for loading the app) for all of this on my best day!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain...but it's always exciting to see new places open in your neighborhood. We've been watching the progress of this Farmer Boys location and since I haven't eaten at one in 4-5 years, I was a little anxious for it to open so I could try them again. Last time I didn't like it, and this time was no different...  For starters, they have a great location right on the corner of Centennial Center & Tropical Parkway/Azure. They are on the SW corner where Big Lots, BJ's & Party City are, and with so many other surrounding businesses, this place is probably going to be packed throughout the day. We went just a couple days after opening and as expected, it was so busy it took us a while just to find a seat. The inside is a bit smaller than I expected but they do have a decent amount of seating and it's always nice to see big, open kitchens. There's a ton of parking outside and of course, they've got a drive-thru as well.  The menu itself is pretty extensive and a lot bigger than I remember. They've got breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, salads, wraps, a few side choices, and even a fried fish dinner. I didn't see anything that says if they specifically do or don't, but I believe breakfast is served all day as well. For those with a sweet tooth, they don't have much in the way of desserts besides a couple milkshake choices though.  Now, the whole thing with Farmer Boys is it's supposed to be a fresh, \"farm to table\" like restaurant. I've heard very few people rave about the food, and now I can see why. I ordered one of their self-proclaimed, \"Award Winning Burgers\" and just wasn't a fan. The patties seem way too uniform to be fresh and aside from the complete lack of flavor in the meat, mine came out cold. All the toppings were basic, nothing seemed fresh and it was extremely sloppy. I also asked for bacon but instead got two small strips of sad, limp and flavorless meat. To top it off, the whole burger and the tray it came on, were soaked in grease. My chili cheese fries weren't much better. Frozen, over-salted fries and they didn't even bother trying to melt the cheese all the way.  They were also having issues with the ice and fountain soda machine when we were there, but instead of blocking it off, they expected customers to try and get their own drinks while some sweaty dude was hanging over the drinks and had his shoes all over the counter. Luckily, one of the managers noticed they were out of tea and happily offered to get me ice and fresh tea from behind the counter. The customer service was really the saving grace for me here. Every employee was friendly and it's nice they come around asking if you need anything or to clean up used plates and such.  I know they're new and maybe I'm being too critical, but reading reviews of other locations, it seems like the food just really isn't that good. They are really close to us, so I might give them another try, probably for breakfast after a few weeks of being open...but for now, I'll pass on Farmer Boys."}
{"text":"For fast food the breakfast is really good but the lunch and dinner is just okay at best"}
{"text":"I had tried the location on Decatur and wasn't impressed so seeing this open just down the street I decided to give them another try.  They were slightly busy the day we went and seating was at a premium.  We got a table after about 5 minutes.  The ordering was a little crazy as the team seemed confused as this was shortly after the grand opening.  After about 10 minutes our food was brought to our table.  We got the Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger meals.  The fries were cold and rubbery.  We ate a couple and discarded them.  The burger was to say politely - boring.  The avocado had no flavor and didn't add anything to the burger.  The burger patty was also nothing special and reminded me of the patties from Carl's Jr - another place I won't eat at.       On a previous visit we tried the zucchini strips and onion rings which reminded me of the Flintstones - they were huge which at first seemed like a bonus.  They use cornmeal batter for the onion rings and zucchini strips which is crumbly and falls off.  It also has a grainy texture which makes things even worse.      I am not sure what the draw is to this place - bad food at high prices. As we sat choking down the Boring Burger we were at the window facing McDonalds.  I realized a Quarter Pounder with cheese would have been so much better than the overpriced cardboard I was currently eating.  So if in the area and need a good burger spend half the cost and go to McD's.  But there is hope for Burger lovers in the SW as Habit Burger is opening on Blue Diamond.  They will be down the street from In n Out.   Going to make things tough on what Burger to choose from - both sounds good!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Good burger, worth the price, fast service, nothing special though. If you're hungry and like burgers go here, if you're all snobby and weird go somewhere else, and get looser fitting jeans, take the beanie off its 90 degress, and ok we get it you have a 71 Schwinn, actually that's pretty cool, how much you want for it? What? that's way too much, now I don't like your Schwinn anymore Blake, and that's all you had going for you.    But seriously check this place out May 4th, get your car washed and eat some burgers. The car wash proceeds help a good cause and a portion of food sales do too, I think, I'll correct that if I find out otherwise.   Get the avocado bacon cheeseburger.....duh."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. First time eating here. Thought it was a touch on the expensive side (for a 3 piece fish and chips) until they brought my food.  The pieces of fish were fairly huge. I couldn't finish but two and I'm a big boy.  Fish mig4habe been have been a touch over cooked for my taste - the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  The menu is massive and has a lot of yummy looking stuff. There's no location near where I live but I have to come down here every now and again, so I am sure I will be coming back quite a few times.  Going to post a picture, the 3 piece fish and fries. :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes the simplest things are the hardest to accomplish.   My only special request was extra pickles. I had to ask twice while ordering. Of course, burger comes to table with 2 pickles. I also need a knife.   Go up to counter and wait while I am ignored. There are no others waiting but somehow they cant be bothered to assist. So i flag a cashier down who says she'll get it. Of course she doesnt. Instead she tries to find the other cashier. Meanwhile she has the knife in her hand walking around and past me twice. Then sits the knife back in the bin. GIRL, GIVE ME THE DAMN KNIFE! She says, \"oh, he (the original cashier) will give it to you. GIRL YOU JUST HAD IT IN YOUR HAND.   Thankfully I go back to the table and i finally get my knife and pickles. It's just too much work to dine in here."}
{"text":"Food is so good!! If only they could give me ranch when I ask for it the first time! It happens every time I go."}
{"text":"We have been here so many times. Today I'm getting a salad to go. The app is worth having. My lunch cost 3.34.  Everyone is so nice.  We have had 2 free or almost free meals, because of the app."}
{"text":"Wanted to try since opening. Prices ok. Burgers and fries were good but not even lukewarm after 20 min wait inside.  Dirty table next to us never cleaned the entire 45-60 min we were here. Gave it a try-won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband really liked the bacon boy. I got the one with jalapeÃ±os (can't remember the name) mine was so dry I had to take a drink of water every other bite. It just seems a little overpriced for someplace with a drive thru. We ordered the zucchini sticks and were not impressed so they were still sitting on the table while we were eating. One of the employees came to us and said they looked soggy and asked if we would like a new batch or a refund. We chose a refund. I thought that was really nice. All the other staff seemed great as well that's why they're getting three stars. Most likely will not be back."}

{"text":"We sometimes come in for a salad or sandwich and enjoy the freshness. In the first week after moving here we had burgers and the chicken sandwich with fries which were good. Last night I had the Southwest chicken salad bowl which is bigger than a bathtub and my husband had Bacon Boy. If you need to go to a chain place either for financial reasons or for convenience, we vote for this place."}
{"text":"Thought I found a new favorite sandwich until I visited this location. Chicken sandwich was bland and extremely dry! If my lunch wasn't so short I'd return my food!"}
{"text":"for what its worth.. here is an update.  A Manager from the California office sent me an email apologizing and wanting to make it right but I lost the email.   So they were attempting to rectify my bad experience......"}
{"text":"Great service! The veggie burger was delicious and the zucchini Sticks were gigantic and very tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Farmer Boys for about a year and have never had a bad experience.  Great Food for a great price."}
{"text":"This shit was the worst burger experience of life and I've had Burger king all thru high school. Long ass wait in line and of course my order was all fucked up. Didn't even get an apology for the wait and I damn sure won't be giving away money to this piece of shit establishment ever again.The food was way over rated as well....puttin salad dressing on burgers does not make u gourmet."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there today. I took a bite into my hash browns and there was hair under it and in it. Which grossed me out. There was no manager present to apologize to me or give me a refund. I think they handled that very poorly. I can say I will not be returning due to the customer service. And people please check your food make sure there are no hairs in it."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times for breakfast. The last time I went, I was eating breakfast and all of a sudden my whole table was covered with ants. I told one of the people there and all they said was that they must have been after the jelly in the packets on the table. I asked if I could at least move somewhere else to finish my food. She said yes you may. No apology, no compensation or anything. I thought my meal should have been discounted or given to me for free since I had to put up with this nonsense. Poor handling of a problem they have at this place. So unless you like eating on a table covered with ants, I suggest you reconsider."}
{"text":"So here is the deal....some place need time to be great. I came here the first week it opened...and ordered the spicy burger and zucchini fries. EVERYTHING was missing salt. The burger was WAAAY to beefy tasting and to had to drench my zucchini fries in ranch because they were so BLAH.   So, I have them another try a week or so later...and BINGO! The nailed it. The food is so fresh! I kinda like the idea that your food is actually made to order. The freshness of the food has given me a whole new perspective on waiting 5-10 min in the drive through. If you tied this place once and didn't like it...give her an ol second chance!"}
{"text":"Pepsi products, and fountain wasn't balanced right, making it gross. Fries taste like undercooked potato's, the ranch is bland and weak. The chili cheese burrito was okay until I bit into what tasted like undercooked hash browns. Kinda greasy, but it is chili cheese I guess.  If you get a salad and split it in two, you will end up not with a 50-50 split, it will be more like 25-25, and 50% of the salad will be missing. Just get it in the big bowl.   The fried zucchini was okay, the Cobb salad would have been good except for the weak ranch. The ChIcken BBQ salad was okay.   For a while, my food tasted like old lady perfume. Then it stopped (coincidentally right after this lady sitting at a table next to me got up and left).  The Barn Burner Burger is good, and their onion rings are good.  If only they had good ranch to dip them in..."}
{"text":"Bleh. First and last time I'll visit that place. Staff seemed like they had no clue what was going on around them. Burger was cold and they messed up the order. Definitely overpriced for the quality. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys used to be my go to when I wanted something yummy to eat. I'm absolutely stunned by the quality of my order tonight though! It's been almost two years since I have come here so was really looking forward to it. I ordered the turkey bacon melt and some onion rings. The onion rings were a bit over cooked, greasy, and tasteless. I couldn't even eat a whole ring. And my turkey melt is supposed to be on grilled sourdough, but it wasn't even grilled long enough to melt the cheese and not browned at all. Until I start hearing that people have had some great food here, I'm not coming back. Price is too high for garbage food!"}
{"text":"First time.  I ordered the avacado cheese burger, no bacon of course, side of chili cheese fries. I went through the drive through it took a little longer but I can respect that since they Make To Order so take your time.  I had to reheat it but I expect that after the drive home. I was Impressed by the burger. The sauce was great along with the avacado. Nice meaty patty. I wasn`t thrilled with the bread, if I could have it on lettuce I would. Chili cheese fries not something I typically eat but they were alright, needed salt. It was a bit pricey but it wasn't a frozen manufactured beef patty like Mcdonalds. Yuk...... Yes I intend to go back."}
{"text":"The food has improved, but the last time that I was there, they had people at the cash register who did not know the US monetary system! The girl turned to another one and asked what was a quarter, and then the difference between a dime and a penny. She had a strong accent, and though I generally don't have a problem with that, if she cannot count change back properly, I DO have a problem with her being at the cash register.  She also told me the wrong amount, and I had to look at the display.  I noticed that after that transaction, she was out cleaning tables.  That is probably much better!"}
{"text":"So many choices to get a burger in town. They have a lot more to offer than most burger joints. Hubby said cheesebutger and fries was very good. I had Cheesy Chicken Tortilla Soup. I wasn't expecting much but WOW was it good,  better than any high priced restaurant I might add. It had fresh cubed chicken, was creamy and spicy. They offer it in a bread bowl too. We never been to Farmer Boys so it took us time to look at the menu via drive thru. The nice lady was patient and helpful  with us and  food came out fast. Look forward to trying more from the menu especially trying breakfast."}
{"text":"4 stars would go to the burger.  It was solid and I would go here again for that.  I got the bell ringer.  The biggest disappointment was the thing I was most excited about and that's the onion rings.  They looked great.  Nice big and fresh.  The problem was that the coating has ZERO flavor.  It tasted like eating a slice of onion.  The fries were average at best.  Not much flavor either.  Service was good.  Food was hot and fresh.  Bathroom was dirty for a new place.   Especially the walls.  They looked disgusting and need to be wiped down."}
{"text":"My coworkers sing praises and moan and gnash at the teeth just to come here.  Once a year maybe, the rest of us relent.  This was one of these times.  I got the Deluxe Bacon Double Burger with 1/2 of hamburger meat. With fries.  What came out was marvelous.  It was juuuust right.  Some burgers have issues where the top. In slides around and it is leaning over like its about to fall.  This was big enough to take a bite out of and not make a big mess.  It was ever so slightly drier than I wish it was, but over looking that it was a decent chunk of meat.   The service was great.  The lady at the register was very friendly and efficient. The boy who brought our food to the table was cool and seemed to enjoy his job, which was really refreshing.  Clean restaurant.  Good parking.  Right off the freeway and in a convenient location.   I'll definitely go here in another year. ;)"}
{"text":"We went to the new one on tropical. I can say that we had never eaten at a Farmer Boy Restaurant, so we were excited to try it out. The star was for fast polite service but not for the food. We ordered two barn burner combos. I had the split side zucchini and onion rings and my husband had fries and had his burger no onions. Being they recently opened it was packed.  The placement of the soda machine was awkward where only one person could get drinks and hurry to find the lids with no where to place your drinks down. When we finally found a seat our order was brought to us. My sides were not right, so we told them and they brought me the onion rings. Then my husbands burger didn't have the jalepenos that should be in the burger and had LOTS of onions! We decided share my jalepenos and scrape the onions off because by this time we were starving. Well after 4 bites my burger was pink and cold and seemed like I was eating a salad. I went to try my onion rings and they had no taste what so ever. By this time we had had enough of the loud conversations where I could barely hear my husband ask me for the ketchup. We left needless to say that my husband didn't finish his meal either. It was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Even though accidents do happen no one is perfect but I still LOVE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE , free food is awesome but they are so awesome. First time recommendation and the breakfast is amazing."}
{"text":"If you are a transplant from S.CA then you know that Farmer Boy's is a staple. This is the closest I can get to classic charbroiled hamburgers from the local stands in S.CAL. This location has the best service in the Valley and I have been to them all. I'm so excited that they finally are adding a location in Centennial Hills, it will save me a 20 minute drive. Great Job in food and service!"}
{"text":"Went to get dinner ask for no onions because my husband can't eat them with out having major heart burn and acid reflex . Guess what onion on everything.  They also forgot my dressing for my salad. Really :("}
{"text":"This is my first time to the location on Stephanie in Henderson. I ordered a Cobb salad! It is so fresh. The lettuce is crisp, natural tasty chopped chicken, and the bacon is good as well. It came with eggs but I took them off! One of the servers Jonathan went above and beyond for me! He saw I did not like the eggs on my salad so he ordered me a fresh salad without the eggs! What great service ! They wanted to see a smile on my face and I sure continued to smile while eating my superb salad! Happy happy ! Very clean and the cheeseburger made with organic meat is sooooo good as well! Thank you for opening in Henderson! Thank you Jonathan and thank you staff! Never a bad day to stop at Farmer Boys! Added bonus: they play classic rock music!"}
{"text":"I hovered between 2 and 3 stars on this one. The bacon burger, and barn burner burger that my friend and I had were delicious.   The fries were kind of meh, and the onion rings had no flavor whatsoever. Seriously, don't even bother with the onion rings. Might try the fried zucchini next time, or just get the burger, which is pretty big anyways. Serves pepsi products, which is unfortunate.  I do like that your order is brought to your table, instead of having to wait at the counter. The burgers are cooked to order, so it's nice and fresh when you get it."}
{"text":"This place was rude and the food wasn't good at all they were mopping no wet signs no were somebody could of fell when I get my food it was cold.... idk why if they took so long to make it."}
{"text":"Yummy fast casual burgers, sandwiches and salads. Excellent service and people. We will be back next time we are down here at the Bullring at LVMS!"}
{"text":"After a morning full of errands I had a huge appetite. From a Yelp search I found Farmers Boy's Restaurant.   The Menu consists of breakfast items and hamburgers the usual american fast food fare. I decided on breakfast and they had a special that day. Omelet combo for $6.20. The meal came with a generous size omelette, fruit, toast, and coffee. For the price it was decent. The hash browns in the Farmer's omelet were soggy. The fruit tasted like it came from a can and it was like playing a game of what fruit is it.  If it weren't for the fact that it was a special I probably wouldn't have eaten here."}
{"text":"I have stopped here at this location a few times since they opened last year and I was super excited they opened a location closer to me since I lived on Sahara and the other locations are way up north or south. The food has been decent up until my last visit a few days ago, I only decided to stop there on my way to work because I refuse to go to the subway drive thru on Decatur anymore. Anyways, I ordered the same sandwich I've always gotten since I started eating at farmer boys when I lived in California. The hearty farmers club sandwich. So I know how it should taste since I've eaten probably a 100 in my lifetime. I was HIGHLY DISGUSTED with my sandwich I ordered a few days ago. Same sandwich except with an extremely DISGUSTING amount of mayo. I couldn't even finish my sandwich it was so bad. I literally gagged two bites in and was so disappointed because I was hungry and in a rush on my way to work . THEY ALSO DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO CUT MY SANDWICH. Sadly I will no longer stop at this location, I will make the longer trek to the Craig and Lamb location, the food is much better and always consistent and the service is much better also."}
{"text":"Food here always tastes better than any location I've been to, in Las Vegas and California. I always get the same thing and every time I come to this location it's always perfect. They sure have my business and definitely beat out the crappy location on Charleston. The service is always great here , the girls are always friendly and I make sure if the girl Cindy is there she takes my order. She always knows what I want before I even have to say anything. She's so friendly and definitely knows how to please a customer. Good job Craig and Lamb, you sure know how to keep good customers coming back hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm around a Farmer Boys, I'm not hungry. Whenever I'm hungry, I'm not around a Farmer Boys. Until now! So I walk in and see a breakfast menu, a burger menu, and some other stuff to the side on the menu.   I feel like if I ordered a burger, this review might have made it to 4 stars.   But I ordered a pastrami sandwich. On ciabatta bread. With chili cheese fries. The chili was NOT fresh. For Farmer Boys to advertise \"we're fresh\" and \"we use fresh, local ingredients\", all I tasted in my chili was the can it came out of. Plus my fries weren't cooked all the way. So my chili cheese fries sucked. I can't say the same for my pastrami sandwich.   My pastrami sandwich on ciabatta was good. Damn good. Pastrami wasn't overcooked. Full of flavor. That sandwich was so good I almost ordered another. Next time I go back to Farmer Boys, I'm ordering a burger. And a pastrami sandwich on ciabatta."}
{"text":"I just had the best service experience I've ever had at Farmer Boys. Exceptional service was given by a cheerful Santino Cambone. I follow a special diet and his attitude was excellent and accommodating. I highly suggest you guys give him a raise."}
{"text":"Ask for the breakfast special. Only $6.89 for 3 eggs, hash browns, bacon and a drink. No extra charge for substitutes like egg whites, fries, side of ranch, ham or sausage, or orange juice ;-)"}
{"text":"First time to Farmer boys. I came to try chopped Cobb salad. It was really good and it was only a dollar to add a soda. If you download the app you get 5 bucks off."}
{"text":"If you are looking for clean fresh food at affordable price come here! We finally got to try for first time and was very impressed.  The Australia girl working was so nice,  I Love great customer service! We will have this place on our \"regular\" list."}
{"text":"So disappointed that I had to make my first yelp review. First off, i upgraded my combo to add chili cheese fries. Turns out it's cheaper to order item separately. I told them farmer boy combo with no onions or avocado. They decided to just give me a bacon boy combo with onions. The $7 burger meat wasn't great, the chili cheese fries weren't worth the $6, the small Pepsi was fine, but $15.93 for three things that aren't spectacular is disappointing. Five guys burgers are much better. Actually Carl's Jr. and Burger King burgers are better. What a waste of $16. I feel so ripped off."}
{"text":"it was amazing! my family can never come up with one place to eat. this is THE place now.  everyone from my picky dad to 6 year old sister.  something for everyone! its not bad pricing and fast food that feels like a diner."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see a low overall rating. My husband and I eat here frequently and the food and service are always great. I love the French toast, but the lack of protein leaves me hungry within a few short hours. Tonight I had a bacon breakfast burrito, and it was delicious. Tons of crispy hash browns and the eggs are made like a super thing omelette so you aren't overwhelmed with egg in any one bite. I also had a cookies and cream shake so needless to say I'm pretty full! I'm not a fan of the burgers, but to be fair I don't like burgers in general. The salads are tasty but I feel wasteful ordering one because it's way too big for me to ever finish. The service is always great-they even gave the hubs fresh bacon tonight because his was way too crispy."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly, as it is a great place to get a quality, fresh, fast food burger. I usually get the Natural Cheeseburger, minus us the thousand island dressing and I sub mayonnaise. It is always a hit!  If you get the onion rings or zucchini, it is a matter of preference. I have brought many people here and they LOVE them. I do not, they are too greasy for my liking. I'm not in love with their fries either, but to each their own. The rest of the food makes up for it.  The breakfast sandwiches and French Toast  are my breakfast favorites. Their bacon is always hot and delicious, which is something that really matters to me.  Pretty much everything you get here is hot and fresh.  The customer service at this location is great. I've yet to have a bad experience and I've been here at least twenty times.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. So, I'd check it out if I were you."}
{"text":"I just went through the drive thru and got the best customer service ever. This young lady, Amalia was so sweet, she literally made me smile while ordering. I ask for the manager to compliment her, and she is the nicest young lady too! (Xena) Both of them displayed great customer service. Kudos to this establishment for hiring, training and promoting our young adults and giving them the tools to give excellent customer service and excel at leadership.  P.S. My All NATURAL BURGER WAS FABULOUS!!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves, but I'm not a fan. Too greasy and I don't like their fries. They used to have a couple menu items I liked but stopped carrying them so I don't bother any longer."}
{"text":"I anxiously awaited the opening of this location, anitcipating the awesomeness that is Farmer Boys. Having been to various locations in Vegas and even across statelines, I was primed and ready to grub on what I had envisioned as one of the finest breakfast meals to ever cross my lips. Based on what I had experienced with the burgers, zuccinni, milk shakes and fries, how could it not be, right?   Unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations for breakfast. It was not bad, but nothing near the quality they produce for lunch. The sausage patties were above average, but everything else (pancakes, eggs, potatoes) was all just middle of the road. The service was still top notch, and all of the employees were on top of their game, even coming to the table to keep the coffee cups full.   With a bonafide pancake restaurant across the street, I would be hard pressed to come back for breakfast but you can bet your burger I will be back many times over for lunch. The fact that there is a Farmer Boys so close to home now is enough to keep a smile on this burger lovers face."}
{"text":"If you're craving a good burger, it's hard to find one better at any other fast food type of restaurant. The fried zucchini is tasty and the orders are big. Half orders are available and would satisfy most  appetites. The staff is friendly and the food was fast without compromising quality. Easy to do within your alloted lunch break and won't put a huge dent in the lunch budget. For the health conscious, the calorie count is posted on the menu. I prefer not to know. Make sure you check-in BEFORE you order."}
{"text":"This place is not good. The service messed up my order twice. First gave me the wrong burger and then gave me tomatoes on my right burger when i said no tomatoes. The onion rings might honestly be the worst onion rings I've ever had in my life and the bell ringer tastes just like a Whopper from Burger King. So many better places to eat in Stephanie Street."}
{"text":"Farmer boys! We go for a good fresh meal whenever we can! Love their zucchini! Dip it in some ranch and I'm in love. Great service."}
{"text":"Im going on 17 mins for the drive thru. What in the f....!!!! I have never been so disappointed. Great food. But this is just ridiculous"}
{"text":"I can not say enough about this place! It's the best fast food I've even heard of! Great salads and the fried zucchini is soo good! They almost make a mean breakfast burrito! Love the vibe and the customer service! A great find!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place ! Friendly staff, fast service and delicious food. I honestly can say if you haven't tried it you definitely should. No complaints about anything. Keep up the great job"}
{"text":"Good customer service except the girl at the register! She was very short and not even a smile. But other than that food came out quick and the 2 Hispanic employees making sure everything was OK and wanting to refill my coffee were great!"}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito and the farmhand breakfast bowl.  The hash browns were way under-cooked which rendered both items inedible.  This is the second time I've tried them for breakfast, there won't be a 3rd time. Awful."}
{"text":"Good food. I actually love salads and wraps there~ they really are fresh for fast food. I taste no sulfites which is a big plus. My hubby and I love the farmer burger which so rocks~ bacon, guacamole,  thousand island dressing~ YUM.   Breakfast is great...French toast platter or farmhand bowls are my favorites and my three year old will eat them (no onions of course on bowls) even with zucchini in it.  Staff super nice and clean joint.   Hint: onion rings and zucchini sides are really good but BIG SLICES so don't be expecting scrawny!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service as well. The manager sharon made sure i was taken care of and keeped checking on me to make sure my coffee was refilled as the one in clovis where I'm from is good food but the customer service there sucks!!! I will keep coming to this farmer boys when I'm  in town."}
{"text":"Advertising a $4.99 burger on the banner outside however they are charging more when you order it, when asked about it they said they raised prices. They should should honor the advertised prices!! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"hello  not happy waited 15 minutes for my order; the size  of the burger was small little meat patty' the mushrooms were soft and greasy[ yuk]the onion rings were to big  widths   the place and tables were clean the ice tea was to strong  10.00dollars for that crap  never again  when are you going out of business good luck craig p"}
{"text":"One day I had to drop by Wal Mart for some quick shopping, then since it was time for lunch I thought I would get some Del Taco, but wait there was a place I've never been to or heard of, \"Farmer Boys\". I didn't even know their menu, but could see alot of cars going through the drive thru and plenty of cars parked outside. I took a chance and ordered a burger combo with zucchini through the drive thru to take home. I did kind of notice the bag, when handed to me was extremely heavy for what I ordered, but didn't think much of it (maybe some heavy ketchup packets?). As I was driving along I could smell the aroma of fresh zucchini so I thought I would take a quick bite. I reached into the bag and could feel one, so I started to pull it from the bag and it was HUGE! like a foot long and enormous! My first thought was I need to tell my wife and take her here, she would love it. I got home and had a good lunch and was glad to find such a good place for once. We went back there yesterday and went inside, again it was very busy and people know good value and good food, so it was a good sign. Our lunch was really good, but I guess the only complaint from my wife was the air conditioner was turned up too high and it was freezing. I actually like it that way, but even for me it was a bit over the top. Overall service is excellent and the staff even comes out to the tables and takes away trays when they can. The decor inside is like a old style farm/barn and kind of rustic, but still it's in the shape of a fast food chain so they don't quite get the effect across, but it's a excellent effort. The menu has some good variety and if you don't want junk food, you can go the healthy route if you wish. (Salads, wraps...). The menu has calorie information, but no one should eat like that everyday right? so no big deal, enjoy and treat yourself.  They have many locations in California and seems they have about 5 locations in the Las Vegas area, but it would be nice to see one in Henderson, just a little bit closer to where we live. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I used to drive all the way passed the airport to eat at the farmer boys on Eastern. (Yeah it is that good!) Now super glad to have a farmer boys about 1/2 mile away, yes!! But wait, sometimes the food is great and sometimes not that good.  They do breakfast fairly well and the ham and eggs are delicious with a good thick ham. The burgers are good and as long as they don't give me old, soggy or hard french fries I'm happy. The zucchini at this location is very inconsistent, often undercooked or overcooked and thin tasteless batter that peels off. I guess this is an item that is tricky to get right depending on the vegetable and who is back there cooking. I wonder if there is a way to find out when a cook that can get it right is working and pass on the days when it's not made properly? Seems the restaurant on Eastern is more reliable. Today my zucchini order was not good, thin peeling breading and not as tasty as the location on Eastern. Sad to say even the ranch dressing was watery. Oh well, the natural burger is always good."}
{"text":"First time there. Pricey, but delicious burgers. Great customer service and food tasted very fresh!"}
{"text":"This is a little out of my way, but I had a KSHP certificate that was going to expire, and since it is against my principals to allow any discount to go unused, I corralled Babygirl and promised we would only have to go to the drive-thru. (Apparently, spending too much time with your mother is a great personal sacrifice. sniff, sniff. Or, maybe she's afraid I'll embarrass her, and, considering the fact that even I never know what I might say next, I guess she has a point).   Anyway, she got the burger with bacon and avocado, so of course it was good. And I got a BLT, which more fast food places ought to serve as it is one of nature's most perfect foods. Of course, it contained somewhat less than the pound o' pork I would have used, but it was pretty tasty nonetheless. The fried zucchini is great- it comes in a huge order of crispy battered spears and the onion rings are actually onion rings. YUM!  (Anyway, I think these were good. As far as I know, they tasted like ranch dressing and ketchup, respectively).  The service was great, meaning the cashier was friendly, you could understand her voice on the speaker, the order was served up in a box (like doughnuts- not squished in a bag! Yay!), and, drumroll please: they got our order right! This was drive-thru Nirvana!  I would definitely return. I would like to try their breakfast- they have actual hash browns and fried eggs, not just variations on an Egg McMuffin like most fast food places. However, a meal like that would lose something in being packed in styrofoam to go, so if I want to give the indoor dining a try, I guess I'll have to go without her!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and really good fish and chips. Try the zucchini sticks. Mmmm. Breakfast is good as well."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went the other day for dinner and i just love the fried zucchini's i could honestly eat those everyday if i could. And the hearty sandwich is also really good and the burger! Burger is just to die for had guacamole and bacon and cheese it was just such a good burger."}
{"text":"I know this place just opened so usually I can excuse the fact that the employees bad service is chalked up to inexperience and getting use to the place. However it doesn't excuse the disgusting long hair I found in my food. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This fast food joint is just meh. Food isn't anything spectacular, nothing that stands out as \"Oh I need to come back!\" It's not a bad place if it's your first time going, but to me, it's kind of similar to Jack in the Box, Johnny Rockets, and places with mediocre burgers. Not a huge fan, but if it's your speed for burgers, milkshakes and whatnot, this is a go-to!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Good food, good service. Can relax after lunch without feeling rushed. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"A fondly remembered taste of SoCal. I was pretty happy to find this place,  here in L.V. Well, the double cheese burger was just as tasty, and smelled just as good as I remembered. The yellow chilis made it perfect. The fries, however, were another story. They were greasy and very soggy.  A bit more spendy than I remember,  too. I'll probably eat here again if I'm in the neighborhood - but I'll forego the fries."}
{"text":"I chose FarmerBoys because it was suggested on Yelp and that's what I rely on while traveling. I had a good feeling when I saw the working crowd -all men eating here. I ordered a Breakfast Burrito with no meat, my husband ordered the Daybreak Sandwich with sausage.  They both were tasty and hot along with a good cup of coffee. Both the manager and the server asked if we wanted refills on the coffee too. I've never heard of FarmerBoys but the signs said 35 years and still fresh, it certainly is."}
{"text":"BLAND and pricey. $10 for a combo.  The fries had no flavor. Ordered the avocado bacon burger. Bacon wasn't crispy. No crunch in the burger, all mush.  The potato bun was good though  I suggest they UP their flavor profiles for the price the price they charge."}
{"text":"The customer service was good, the girl was polite and friendly. However we did have to wait awhile for our food. The strawberry milkshake was delicious but the rest of the food was incredibly salty! The chicken tortilla soup was so salty I couldn't tell the difference between the salty taste or spice. The chili cheese fries were a disappointment for sure. The fries were floppy and the chili and cheese looked like they were dumped on top and microwaved.  Maybe our expectations were set too high....we're used to Cookout chili cheese fries and milkshakes  if you've ever been to the south for some Cookout, you know there's no comparison."}
{"text":"Just wow! First time here and so impressed! The food is incredible! We ordered the Farmer burger, fish and fries and the chili cheese fries, btw that's enough to feed a whole football team (there's just my husband, myself and our six year old!) so leftovers! The food is awesome, but the service was outstanding too! Angel took our order what a nice kid, and Carmella brought it to the table. She was so attentive, making sure we were happy and had everything we needed. I didn't expect such service from a burger joint! Great employees, delicious food, and so fast! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant or the chain itself was on Monday, April 29, 2013. I was EXTREMELY impressed. When I walked in, I had no idea that this was part of  a chain restaurant.  The food deserves five stars. It was reasonably priced. The owner of the franchise went out of his way to make me feel comfortable. I will definitely go again and bring friends :-)"}
{"text":"I've been having a super crappy day and I cane here to eat. I cane up to the front not knowing what i eanted and the young lady was not only helpful but super nice, wvwn tho im pretty sure i was standoffish to her. I ordered my food wrong (totally 100% my fault) and they saw me look taken back when they brought it out. I said no its totally fine and began to pick at it. They went and had me new food made and offered me more fries at no charge. The woman who I assume was the manager was sooooo nice too. Food was great. Made my day better and totally changed my attitude."}
{"text":"Nice meal. More selections than expected on menu. More like clean eating vs. fast food."}
{"text":"\"Farm Fresh Breakfast?\"  How \"fresh\" could a restaurant like Farmer Boys be with a drive-thru that serves food faster to drivers than everyone else dining in? That should've been a sign to turn around, but I'm always down for trying something new.  Ordering inside is disorganized. There's no indication where the line for ordering begins. Basically, you just stand around and read the menu until someone comes by and asks if you're ready to order. After ordering, you're given a number and your food is delivered to your table. Kind of reminds me of eating at Carl's Jr.   Hot Cakes Combo: I didn't finish my order of eggs, bacon (sausage patties are also an option), and two basic pancakes. My scrambled eggs were the best part. They weren't seasoned, but I prefer them that way. The bacon was greasy and shriveled, and the pancakes....well, they had tiny, mysterious BLUE SPECKS. Yech!  Ham and Cheese Omelette: This was my boyfriend's order. The omelette was hearty with ham, cheese, and diced green bell peppers. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad. Other than that, the toast was horrible, as well as the sausage patties.   Biscuits and Gravy: To be honest, we weren't sure if this was on their menu when we ordered, but they delivered. So much for biscuits, this was essentially pancakes and gravy, which was seasoned heavily with pepper and had a strong sausage flavor. Not. Good.   There was nothing \"farm fresh\" about the breakfast we had here."}
{"text":"review is for the guy taking orders, I believe his name was Lamar (young black guy) his customer service was outstanding! very friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job. very rare for a fast food spot. I think this location is very fortunate to have him."}
{"text":"Typically I do not choose a place based on YELP ratings if they have under 100 reviews.  This place had only 70 or so with a pretty high rating, so we decided to try it..   We do not have this franchise anywhere near where I live so we wanted to try it while on our stay in Las Vegas.  I do LOVE that they serve breakfast all day.  First- we went there at night- and honestly this does not seem to be in a stellar neighborhood.  There were folks loitering outside that made me uncomfortable. In fact I had my husband take his watch and ring off and put it in his pocket before we went in to order.  We were there really close to closing.  Even so the employees were very nice and did not make us feel rushed.  We had elected to eat there and they cleaned up while we ate.  I decided to have the Veggie Burger.  Its so neat to have that option at a Fast Food place like this.  I also ordered the Onion rings based on reviews here.  The Veggie burger was very good.  The Onion Rings were blah.  The batter completely tasteless and the onions were also big and tasteless.  Definitely not worth having. The Zuchinni spears were also blah. Same boring batter and I don't  like a long, huge Zuchinni stick,  I was anticipating slices.  Hubbys meal was not so good.  So, we have at least experience Farmer Boys.  We may try a breakfast there one day if we happen to be near one.  However it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"My stars are for the hardworking guys bussing tables and engaging with customers.   We ordered a kids meal with fruit and a cheeseburger combo. It took about 15 minutes. The kids meal came out with cold fries while the burger combo had fresh fries. But the kids meal was supposed to come with fruit anyway? Also, the burger was cold. I'm not sure how it could take 15 minutes to prepare old fries and a cold burger but that's what we got. The guy cleaning tables got the fruit cup for us and was really nice but I would never eat there again. The place is pretty expensive for fast food so it's just not worth it. I'd rather go to a restaurant for a few dollars more and get real service."}
{"text":"It's ok food that gives very large portions. They also have coupons online and sometimes in local papers. Grab them so you can save a few bucks.  The burgers here are very large but don't have enough flavor for my taste buds. If you like zucchini this place has the largest zucchini sticks I have ever seen. They are ok but get soggy to fast.  I always see long lines here for breakfast and lunch and the most popular items are hamburgers and the breakfast plates. Breakfast here is probably the best choice and I think you can also order it for lunch which is nice."}
{"text":"The food was good had a chicken avocado sandwich and the chicken was nice and juicy. The zucchini side was great, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Check #146254-1 First time here at Farmer Boys. Ordered the All Natural Burger 1/3 with bacon and avacado, fries and zucchini , and Vanilla shake. Also had Big cheese burger.  All natural burger: 10 Fries: 4 soggy Zucchini : 10 Vanilla shake : 9 Big Cheese Burger: 5 was not as juicy                               as All Natural Burger  Great place, Very friendly staff...... Will highly recommend  Will be back.........."}
{"text":"Farmers Boys never does me wrong.  Came to Vegas with the family and stoped here for a quick bite.  Have been to their Ca locations before.  Always loved it and loved this just as much.  Awesome burgers...clean orderly atmosphere. Friendly service.   Did I say awesome burgers.   Yummmmm crispy fries and onion rings too!!"}
{"text":"Had the farmers burger double patties. A little expensive at $7 only $5 at Fatboy and better juicier and hotter but they were closed for Labor Day."}
{"text":"3 stars for burger hubby said it was okay nothing special, the onion rings are a total disaster, no flavor on batter and it just comes off the onion thin and not crispy. Not coming back, sorry."}
{"text":"Currently picking up my moms order while my Canes chicken fingers get cold next to me. The line is 10 cars long and I just order after 10 minutes in line. I'd go inside but I got the dog with me. I'm looking at a another 15 minutes ahead of me. Great .  Hope they got my order right."}
{"text":"I am updating this review because I haven't seemed to have any issues with picking up phone orders on time anymore. They for the most part always have the food ready when they give you the pickup time estimate which was the only thing I felt really needed improvement from them. Great job and thanks for listening!"}
{"text":"This review is for this specific location.   I've been to many Farmer Boys throughout the valley and have always been greeted with good food and friendly people, but this place SUCKS!   1. The cashier got our order wrong. Along with our meals, we ordered 3 shakes. The cashier confirmed that there were 3 shakes before I paid. When they brought it out there was only 2. We immediately said it was supposed to be 3. No biggie,  they started making one. The lady brought out a shake (the wrong flavor) and asked to see our receipt (very rude btw) . Apparently the cashier didn't get our 3 shakes in EVEN THOUGH HE CONFIRMED IT BEFORE I PAID. whatever.. We didn't see a need to pay for the wrong flavor shake.   2. Food came out fairly quickly (pro) BUT OUR ORDERS WERE ALL MIXED UP.  Our order wasn't complicated,  just some people didn't want onions, pickles, or tomatoes and others did. I checked our receipt and the cashier got this part right, but looks like the cooks didn't... At this point we are already in a bad mood with the wrong order, rude lady, and mixed up order. I'm not the type to send food back so we kind of just \"dealt with it..\"   3. Food was not on par. Zucchini were soggy af!  We ended up throwing them away. Burgers were cold. Fries were stale   At first I was just going to write off this location, but the more I think about how bad the whole experience was I may never go to a Farmers Boys again.  Actually, yeah, I'll never go to a Farmer Boys again. Thanks for nothing  Farmer Boys."}
{"text":"After reading so many bad reviews, I was reluctant to eat here, but I thought I would give it a try. The store was fairly busy. It was about one o'clock on a Thursday. I waited on line for about five months minutes and then ordered.  I had the four piece fish dinner. I asked for extra onion rings instead of a side salad. The wait time for the food was about fifteen minutes.  The fish was well cooked, the fries were acceptable but old and the bread was a little burnt. The onion rings are another story. There were six giant onion rings on my plate. There were five and a half when I was done. The rings were undercooked and tasteless. I was shocked. Now I know. Avoid the onion rings. I will return to try other items but never the rings again."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to get a burger now!  Delish!  Given, these are not thick restaurant-style burgers, more like a Wendy's patty size, only better.  The bacon had a great flavor and was nice and crisp.  This is my new favorite burger joint.  The only con is that their fries were only OK.  I prefer fries with some seasoning or kick to them, and these were just a basic thicker fry.    Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This place drops the ball all the time  Old bacon one day  No salt and pepper or receipt the Next. They really just don't care! I've noticed that the corporate stores  Do a much better job as opposed to franchise  Stores"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Farmer Boys. It was tasty but not really what the pictures showed on the menu. I went through the drive-thru and the staff was friendly. I ordered a Cheese Steak and it was kinda mushy. I wouldn't order that again but try something else instead. The Onion Rings were very tasty and I recommend trying those for sure.  It was about $10 for the sandwich, Rings and Drink. I will give it another try sometime in the future and see if I like anything else."}
{"text":"First, let me say the food was delicious once I finally got it.  That, and the fact that several crew members were genuinely concerned about the time it was taking to get my meal, are the reasons for 3 stars on this trip.   Otherwise, this experience would warrant 1 star.  I ordered the Turkey Bacon Melt during breakfast hours.  But since the entire menu is available all day, that shouldn't have been a problem.  I was with friends and we ordered separately.  My friend and I both ordered shakes.  She received her shake and I continues to wait for mine...for about 10 minutes total.  Finally got the shake.  At 16 minutes, I inquired about my meal.  The crew member agreed 16 mins was excessive.  Another crew member stopped by and also checked on my food.    After 22 mins, my food arrives, but was made incorrectly.  I sent it back.  6 mins later, my new meal arrived.  It was delicious!  However, I find it odd that a manager never stopped by to discuss this situation.  Ultimately, I'm not impressed by the lack of concern shown by a manager, but I was genuinely impressed with the crew members.  I will be back and hope to have a better experience."}
{"text":"Value.  Just found out about this place a month ago.  The burgers and fries are very good for the price.  The milkshakes are excellent.  The staff is very friendly.  They serve breakfast any time of the day.  Will try it the next time I go in.  Loyalty program is a plus."}
{"text":"Good service and good food! I had an offer through there phone app for a free big cheeseburger. How could I deny myself? The burger was good with half onion rings and half fries. I didn't know I even had that option. The girl behind the counter suggested it! Keep comin' with the free food and I'll be there!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places i have been, what a rip off. Sandwich with a thumb hole in it. Chicken cold, bread so soggy i couldn't be picked up,  soda just carbonated water no syrup. Worst $11.99 i have spent. Never again."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru of this location and the customer service was HORRIBLE. They were rude, didn't like mark out drinks and then could not tell us what they were. Then we were missing a French fry and when we tried getting their attention again they were all standing around talking to each other though they look right at us never acknowledge us. We had to lay into the horn for them to say did you need something. NEVER again will we return to this location on Tropical Pkwy. I only gave then 2 stars because the  the food is good but the service didn't even deserve one star :("}
{"text":"The burgers here are great, the fries on the other hand are average.  The burger was juicy and flavorful and was very satisfying. The fries were comparable to McD/BK along those lines.  I've been there 3 times and every time the burger is delicious and hot but the fries come up shorthanded.  If you're a big get person over burger then this is not for you. #JustSayin"}
{"text":"I've passed by several of these franchises, and always thought about stopping, but never did.  So we decided to go and check this place out. The staff was really nice, and patient with us.  So we decided on a double combo, and 1 burger on the side. (the burger on the side was for me) I don't know the name of the burger, but it had a double patty.  They have a burger, fry and soda for $5.99 The bun was so soft, and they put old fashion Thousand Island dressing on it!  O'lord!  this burger was amazing  Come to find out, they serve breakfast all day.  It looked pretty good too.  We will be going back real soon."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and the staff is great, even refilled my drink for me. Farmers Burger is the best burger on the menu."}
{"text":"I was driving by this place and thought I'd grab a burger on my way home. I'd never heard of it, but the name was appealing... don't think I'll ever be going back.   I ordered a farm burger combo. After getting my food, I peaked in the bag quick and noticed the zuchinni sticks instead of fries. I said something to the girl in the window that I had asked for fries. Without any verbal response, she handed me a bag of fries and then walked away as I was trying to ask if she wanted the original bag with the zucchini back. Guess not...  Once I got home, I unwrapped my \"burger\" only to find it was a breakfast burrito. Super super disappointing. I feel like the girl at the window should have rechecked my entire order when she got part of it wrong.   Since I was hungry, I tried the food they did give me, and I thought the zuchinni was tasteless and the burrito was pretty salty.  I actually did like the fries, but I'm still craving a burger...  like I said, i won't be going back or recommending this place to anybody else."}
{"text":"I was hearing so many good things about this chain. To quote my man Flav, \"Don't believe the hype\"! I had a patty melt at many of places and understand they can be greasy. This thing was swimming in grease. The bread was saturated and didn't have any crisp to it. The bottom of the basket was just as soaked as the bread. The onion rings were equally as bad. The coating falls off soon as you touch them and not flavorful at all. I tried some fries a friend ordered. Nothing that your local supermarket doesn't carry. Yeah Boyyyy that will be my last visit."}
{"text":"This location just recently opened. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Avocado Sourdough Sandwich. The flavor was to be expected if you're familiar with chicken club with avocado sandwiches. The initial appearance of the sandwich looked good but here is where it went downhill.  I would suggest either smaller slices of bread or put more chicken to fill up the space on the bread. There are too many bites where you don't get a bite of chicken or tomato. One small slice on each half was not enough. Also, if the menu says avocado then I am picturing slices not smashed up avocado spread on the bread. Gave the sandwich a mushy texture. Unpleasant! All in all it was skimpy. The staff however was friendly!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst experience I've had at a fast food restaurant. I decided to try this place after receiving the $5 off promotion from their rewards app.  I ordered the Hearty Club combo which after the $5 off amounted to another $7. I was the second person to order in my group of 4 and the last to receive my meal. This wasn't a normal 5 minute wait, I ended up waiting 23 minutes for a simple Club sandwich that I would have been better off going into the kitchen and making myself.  It absolutely amazed me that my meal was not prioritized despite being #1 in the queue for almost 18 minutes. The manager kept pulling in new orders into the queue and calling them out instead of addressing the older orders.  And of all the things to streamline in the kitchen, why wouldn't sandwiches be one of them? You're literally assembling premade ingredients.  To make matters worse the lemonade dispenser for the fountain drinks was serving water. From reading the other reviews here, this seems like a common occurrence.  For the price of $12 a meal I expect a much better experience than what was had and certainly better quality of food. Needless to say, I will not be coming back and the app has been deleted from my phone so I am not reminded of this nightmare in the future."}
{"text":"Terribly slow, and then order was completely messed up and food was cold. Complained to shift leader who walked away in the of telling her what was wrong. Not even an apology had to ask for mustard 3 times before they finally brought it"}
{"text":"Omg another phantom so called diner. I can't even begin to state the lack of care and quality. The only positive was the counter guy Rosman. He cared more about my experience than did management. Food cold, onion rings no taste, fries soggy, burger tasteless and boring. I'm so unpleased with the quality. Don't go here. It's a scam. The manager was avoiding and could care less about my experience. He spent more time jiving with the Hispanic women and looking at there chest and behinds. What a joke. Where is the owner. Watching sports and enjoying  his life on my money. Total crap."}
{"text":"I'm in the bubble with Farmers Boys on Rainbow. The food is delicious especially their Breakfast menu! The Chopped Cobb salad I can make poetry about! They were even nice enough to give my son's fresh fruit order nothing but grapes! My son loves grapes. The staff is polite so no complaints there. The only issue I have and doesn't matter if it's through drive thru or dine in, they take LONG! So long they even warn you when you dine in when they give you a number. If they were just maybe 5 mins faster I would give them 4 stars BUT the food is delicious so I give them that! If it wasn't I would have given them 2 stars"}
{"text":"Sharon was the lady who took our order. I have the loyalty app which had a coupon for a free side. she acknowledged my coupon and took my phone behind the counter yet the free side wasn't added to the order. we also asked to upgrade the soda to a large and she said ok and handed us a medium. lucky we weren't charged for the large but still the fact that she heard and acknowledged our request but completely ignored them was what made this a bad experience. we went back up to let them know she didn't add the side to the order and she just said ok. then our food came and of course no side. the server was nice and he brought me fresh zuchinni sticks shortly after. my boyfriend and I come here often and usually have a great experience and this is why they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food like all the other Farmer Boys locations.  Terrific customer service.  Danny even stopped by our table and took our ice teas for a refill.  Unheard of in a fast food restaurant.   Love the Farmer Boys Cobb Salad.  Definitely the \"BEST\" fast food salad around.  \"Ring the Bell\" for our new local Farmer Boys !!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it , our food arrived cold and was tasteless. I didn't want to stand in line again to send it back since their is no table service. And it's pricey"}
{"text":"The food was good but a little on the pricey side!! I went and they were not busy and took about 15 min to get a burger and fries!?!? The dining area was clean and staff friendly.The menu is very confusing.The menu shows pictures and the names of items but nowhere did it say what actually comes on the items!! I feel that the food is way too salty especially the burgers.Its worth trying but not a must have."}
{"text":"I ordered the Natural Burger Combo w/ avocado & bacon (extra cost) which totaled to about $10+  Pros: * Burger is juicy & tastes fresh  * Meal size is good & filling * Burger buns are soft * Manager checks up on you at the table to make sure you're okay * They sporadically clear the table for you  Cons: * Burger is a little messy to eat, and kept falling apart * Fries are ordinary & a bit bland * Fried zucchini was a bit bland * Prices are a little high for a burger place  Overall, it was good & I'd go back here. I'm really keen to try their breakfast items!"}
{"text":"okay, tonite i was in the mood for a quick burger so we decided to check out this farmer boys location a little closer to the house.  from the time we walked into the restaurant i could tell i was not in a 'typical' fast food joint... it is so clean and inviting! it reminds me of a down-home diner.   some quick notes: - customer service was outstanding - food tasted delicious - was served to us hot and with nice presentation - pastrami sandwich is ON POINT!  thank you farmer boys! we will def be back!!  ooh, and just as an added bonus; the ladies room is super clean and smelled like bath n body works!! ha"}
{"text":"We only went through the drive through today but from the second we were welcomed by the person on the other end of the intercom Desiree.. we felt that it was amazing customer service!!! She was very sweet and funny and we were a bit difficult with our order but not for one second felt any annoyance in her tone of voice she was just very pleasant all around and thought she should be noticed for it! These days it's hard to find good customer service and she had it! She made the experience awesome for us and food is amazing and fresh!"}
{"text":"Extreme bacon boy - bomb! House chili bowl - Luke warm/cold. (Cheddar cheese wasn't even melted) Zucchini sticks - bomb! The lady at the register, couldn't care much about her customers.  I would try this place again at another location but request the chili to be piping hot."}
{"text":"If i could i would give them negative stars for the experience i just had, i would do about a negative 3. On Christmas Eve i came and spent 30 dollars on meals for me and my boyfriend, we waited 45 minutes in the drive thru, the guy in the car behind me even came up to the window to see what the hold up was. After waiting 35 minutes and only receiving one drink i went inside to use the restroom, came back out and waited another 10 minutes just to get home(right across the street)and find out that my fish was soggy and greasy and the Fries that came underneath them were completely drenched in grease, onion rings were soggy too, being that I've worked in the food industry, those were done first and waited for the rest of the food, my chicken tortilla soup was warmed up nacho cheese in a bowl. So i call a manager and Kahanu tells me to come back and get my refund i made it very clear i DID NOT WANT THE FOOD. I go in today as requested to find Esmeralda the very helpless shift leader telling me she can not refund my order and that she can make it again... keep in mind i had my receipt in hand... i know for a fact my order is still in your system and it's not my fault he didn't write it in the books. So here am i being told to come back a third time to discuss it with Kahanu AGAIN...never again will i eat here, this experience completely killed it for me, undeleting your rewards app, I'm done. Don't ever come here and order thru the drive thru during holidays, or in general just don't come here, miscommunication is such a shitty trait for business"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  I had never heard of it until my sister took me here the other day for breakfast. I ordered the French toast combo it came with eggs and  choice of sausage or bacon and a drink. We both got the same combo we had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon so our meal came to around $11 .  The food was AMAZING so delicious and very big portions!  You can do the drive thru or dine inside we ate inside, the service was great very friendly staff and are on top of everything. I would deffantly eat here again next time i wanna try there cheeseburgers i heard there rea good.  Anyone who hasn't been must go :)"}
{"text":"All the times I've been here it's been good. The service is usually good. I got a coupon through email for my birthday. They said I couldn't use it because they are corporate and it's for the franchise locations. That is misleading. I've never been to the other locations but apparently that's the only place you can use that coupon. Then they ran out of cinnatreats which they advertised. If this is the corporate location is should accommodate more than a franchise. Probably won't be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Yet another fast food chain offering infinite fried options. What sets this place apart is the drive thru pancakes. They're not any better than ihop, but you don't have to get dressed to order em either. The burgers are fine, but too fatty for my taste. There's nothing particularly farm fresh about the place. The milk shakes are pretty good. Worst onion rings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Every couple months I'll take a Friday lunch break and head over to the Farmer Boys for a big, bad Farmer Combo...double bacon cheese burger with avocado, a pile of fries(ranch, please)and an iced tea(just ok). While it isn't the cheapest fast food available, I find it MUCH tastier than any national chains.  Similar to a high quality LA- style burger stand. Extensive menu, food made fresh and good potions are worth an extra $2 to me on the rare occasion I go out for lunch.       Today was kind of a bummer however as the line was longer than usual and only two cashiers were working the front instead of the usual 3 or 4. It took 25 minutes to get our order in rather than usual 5 or 10, which absolutely blows especially when you're staring at everyone else's pltes of goodness!  Fortunately our meals came out quickly and tasted as great as always. Quick and friendly staff here, they just needed a few more today and for that reason it was a 3 Star lunch overall although the food always hovers closer to 4 IMO."}
{"text":"They have the best three egg breakfast in town. I been going for three months now and the quality and consistency has been perfect. Not one runny egg or burnt toast. I'm am very impressed"}
{"text":"The food is good but forget it due to the drive thru. Absolutely unacceptable wait times. The Farmer Boys on Rainbow is the same way. Why bother with a drive thru if it takes twenty mins to service two cars at a time. Pathetic...... finally after ordering at 1:03 my food at 1:33 and Ajae has the worst suctioned service EVER not only did she not apologize for the wait. She handed me my food and said NOTHING not thank you not sorry. Nothing. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"We called to place a couple orders for pick-up today 9/15. When we opened our food when we got back to the office, 2 of our wraps had a chunk of ice in it!!!   Imagine eating a chicken club wrap, taking a bite, and you bite on a cold hard ice! Luckily it didn't break our teeth or anything!   This simply shows that they are not paying attention to what they are putting on their food! It's ridiculous.   The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because my colleague called and spoke to a manager and the manager offered 2 free wraps next time for the inconvenience.   I will make an update on this review once I get my free wrap and see how they do next time."}
{"text":"Gross.  I had the Natural.  Overcooked tasteless burger with no juice left whatsoever.  Won't be coming here again.  The fries are thick, flimsy and greasy. The kids meal came with canned fruit."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the food is pretty good, it's not as hot as I'd prefer but it's good. I'd say they're a bit overpriced. Today i had a terrible experience. I got to the drive thru window after waiting for 10 min, she tells me the total and I was like that's not what you said but maybe I was wrong so I gave her my money. She handed my drink which was a large pink drink and I ordered a medium dr. Pepper. When she came back with my change, I told her this isn't my order. Without saying anything to me she looks at her screens and closes the window. A minute or 2 passes and she tells me she didn't have my order. I was like well I ordered, she asked me if these other customer orders were mine which they were not. She tells me again they do not have my order. I was like okay.. I know I ordered and while I was talking she started talking over me explaining that hey don't have my order. Instead of trying to find a solution she was talking loudly about not having my order. Finally she asked what I ordered. Not once did she apologize, she wasn't even polite. I brought that to her attention and she goes 'this is me apologizing' still.. she didn't apologize. I was talking to her and she said have a nice day and closed the window on me. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered half french fries and zucchini fries with my burger but they took my order wrong and got me onion rings instead of french fries.  I asked the lady who got me a food and told her this is not what I ordered but it seems like she doesn't really care..  she just said will bring  you french fries..  BUT she never got back to me.."}
{"text":"Once again I came on to get lunch and the staff was sweeping and mopping floor while customers are eating . Time was 2:32 pm  Not good, while people are eating."}
{"text":"Been waiting over 30 mins  For order People came in after us ordered and were served Jesus Manager really apologized but seemed robotic  Didn't really gave a crap that we had to wait Then only 2 of the 3 items came Had to get mine to go Just lost me as a customer"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I have never had any problems and the food has always been amazing. Theres nothing else I could say than great things."}
{"text":"WTF DO THEY PUT IN THESE BURGERS!!!???? The first time I had a burger from here is when I stayed in perris  ( lake perris california ) and it was remarkable. So today me and my wife ate at the eastern blvd location right across from walmart by the airport. Let me tell you this besides the long line in the drive thru. It was well worth the wait. The lady at the window was very polite and courteous. If you haven't tried this place you should. It's a amazing hamburger spot. They also have pancakes. Well uhhhh don't know how I feel about a hamburger joint serving pancakes lol. But wait mickey dees serve right?? Idk but any who. Great burgers for a reasonable price. Try it and let me know how it turns out."}
{"text":"The fast food vibe kind of threw us off but the employees came by our table 4 times. So the restaurant is an order at the counter fast food style and table service. It was very nice. The food was good. The coffee good."}
{"text":"I ordered a Swiss Burger combo for $9.39 they brought out an omelette then acted like it was our problem, they came back out with a thrown together burger with a few Fry's, does this look like a $10 meal you'd buy?"}
{"text":"Told them no bacon in my wrap and still put it in there.had to drove all the way back bc I didn't check it right away,lol.manger didn't even say sorry when I went back there. WOW."}
{"text":"I usually don't write yelp reviews,  and to be honest I've never been to Farmer boys before but I had to write something for this place. 1st of all the resturaunt is pristinely clean. Very astheric 10/10 haha 2ndly the cashier was super great!  He informed me of all the deals, promos and etc. Even told me what I could substitute without me asking. Super nice and informed guy. Keep up the great work Christian!  5/5 stars for the food,  workers,  and resturaunt as a whole."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried zucchini and it was soggy and mushy! The worst fried zucchini I have ever had. Not to mention, it took almost 30 minutes for me to get 4-pieces of zucchini. I have been eating at Farmer Boys since they opened in Orange County, California. I have eaten at the locations on Craig, Eastern and Decatur. I will continue to drive to one of these locations when I want fried zucchini. They need to teach the Stephanie location how fried zucchini is supposed be made.  Not a good first impression! I want my damn money back!!!"}
{"text":"Very poor ! My coffee cup has lipstick , which means they are not sanitizing / washing their dishes ! Never again in this FARMER BOYS . And their wait is very long  , I left got my refund . Manager offered to give me food and refund but no thanks ."}
{"text":"Great burgers. We ordered the Farmer Boy and The Natural. The onion rings are HUGE. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Okay...so I hate to do this but I have been back to Farmer Boys 3 times in the past few weeks and the food quality has gone down horribly! Each time I ordered the Farmer Boy burger combo with zucchini and each and every time the burgers were char-burn't beyond belief, the zucchini has been mushy and the breading not sticking to the pieces and the burger rolls not tasting very fresh.  It seems like they have lost their amazing store manager who I have not seen in over a month. He was on top of this place like no other. Now it seems like the place is just running on it's own motion - with lack of management and attention to food quality and detail. The service is less outstanding and not as energetic as I have been used to here as well.  I'm going to take a break now from this institution until I hear that things are back to normal. I don't like writing Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde reviews - as this really disturbs me that they have lost their consistency, their overall attention to food quality and preparation and enthusiastic customer service.  What has happened here Farmer Boys - you have got to get this fixed ASAP as I have truly loved everything previously!"}
{"text":"Everytime my husband and I come here, the food is ALWAYS GREAT!!!  The prices are a bit pricey BUT HEY I'd rather pay $10 for a PERFECT BURGER COMBO than a $6 SLOPPY HAMBURGER from a small burger stand!!!  The BREAKFAST IS REALLY GOOD TOO!!!  The place is ALWAYS clean! Plenty Parking They have an outside patio You can also Dine In They are great with Callin in orders as well, your food will be ready at the time they tell you  Great customer service, never had an issue"}
{"text":"They are improving.  Went thru their drive-thru last night, and was back on the road in 8 minutes.  Darn good chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Farmer Boys to expand to Las Vegas! In my opinion they have one of the best breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches out there. The burgers are tasty too!   Now the kicker....this is considered a fast food joint and its location is a wee bit in the hood. All this considered, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I don't know about you, but I love friendly people serving my food. Oh! One last point is that they have an open kitchen concept where you can see your food being prepared. You won't see this at McDonald's!  Go get your farmer boy on!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"And again.... 30 min wait. This is a shame.... These guys have no standard. I don't care about the 30 words. A drive through is speedy and not what these boys promise. Done with farmer boys or girls."}
{"text":"Excuse my after shot but I have to be really impressed with presentation to take a before photo.  This place is somewhere between a diner and fast food.  They serve breakfast all day and I paid $15 for 2 meals. (1 was for a kid)  I don't prefer finely chopped salad but there were absolutely no wilted or gross looking leaves.  That was very important.   The ranch dressing is very good.  My sons chicken looked a bit small and overcooked on the outside but the white meal inside was perfect. I couldn't stop \"sharing\" his fries.  Tables need to be cleaned faster and there was some grossness on the floor from previous diners.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Great food  Breakfast bowl and omelets are great.  They also appreciate veterans and first responders with special pricing.  People are very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a park day with biking.  Service. I wish the cashier taking our order was friendlier, she looked have awake and inpatient to take the order. However, the staff that brought our order and cleaned our table was very nice and friendly.  Food. The salad I had was fresh and crisp, and very big. I couldn't finish it all. Cali BLT was good, the bacon made crispy but not dried out at all. Pastrami was nicely flavored too."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  I ordered the 4 fish meal and it was way too much food, but soooo good. This will be my go to when I want a fish fry. My husband ordered one of the burgers and was happy with that, too.  We dined in, it wasn't too busy, and our food took 12 minutes to arrive, pretty good for food that was cooked to order. I have them a 4 not 5 only because I didn't get the onion rings I was supposed to, and they forgot the chocolate shake I ordered, but they gave me no problem in getting those things, but I did have to ask."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there here in Vegas !!! Always love them , back in California !! Clean and very healthy delicious food!!"}
{"text":"I can always count on Farmer Boys! They are consistent and delicious! It's always clean inside and the staff is friendly. Everything I've had there has been good, but I was pleasantly surprised by the fish and chips. Not only is it good, but to get it in a drive through makes it even better."}
{"text":"I've had better burgers at Sonic. 20 minutes in the drive thru. Their fries are worse than in n out. That says a lot. I'll be avoiding this place from now on. Super gross. And the food ended up making me sick, and I didn't even finish the burger and fries. My friend said the salads are good, but I'll save myself the $8 and go somewhere good."}
{"text":"Slow, Slow, Slow service for plain hamburger that was cold, tough, and tasteless. Health Department  grade \"A\" posted on wall, but place didn't look all that clean. Needs to be reinspected. Much better choices for burgers."}
{"text":"They literally just opened today, we are getting our SUV tinted and we saw a Farmer Boys on the way!  Great staff and Kyle was awesome introducing us to download the app and get $5 off!"}
{"text":"I had not dined at Farmer Boys for a few years and decided to give this location a chance. I used their drive thru and was greeted promptly. The customer service was nice and the employees are very polite. However, the food is overpriced for the quality. I ordered a bacon avocado burger and the avocado was only on one side of the burger. There is hardly any produce on the burger, it's all about the beef. The beef is cooked on an open flame, which is why I had to wait 10 minutes to receive the order after paying (no one else was in the drive thru at the time). I did not really notice much of a difference in flavor of the patty to most other fast food chains.   Paying 11+ dollars for a single, regularly sized combo, I honestly expected to be blown away and sadly I was fairly disappointed. I would have been better off going somewhere else and regret my decision to go to Farmer Boys because of the lack of value. I will definitely continue my loyalty to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to eat is onion rings and mine were way over cooked and dried out. They were nasty. The burger was good but it is pretty hard to mess up onion rings so I was very disappointed. Not sure if I'll go back. Deep fried foods are one of the easiest things to make and a lot of the food on the menu there is deep fried."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm being picky or just being a pregnant lady. Anyways, I was excited to try this place out, but honestly a little let down. The taste of the ABC burger was good but literally means avocado, bacon, and cheese... I wish the lady would of gave me an heads up that it didn't have any lettuce or tomatoes... For the fried zucchini, geezus I understand it's called farmer boys but these are not items that you can eat in the car. They take a whole zucchini, cut it into 4 long humongous pieces and fry them. I don't know, overall it was a let down. Don't get me wrong the flavors were good but it was missing something or a few things. Wait, my burger was crushed by the fried zucchinis. Literally a flat ABC burger."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before, but saw it while driving and decided to stop for breakfast with a friend. We both ordered the breakfast burritos. They were huge portions, and above average quality. As for price, it is more expensive than your typical fast food chain, but my perception of value improved significantly because they offer a student discount. The ingredients were also of higher quality than most fast food chains (they actually crack whole eggs!). The menu has a ton of variety, so it should please your whole group whether looking for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Food 4/5 Service 3/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Value 3/5"}
{"text":"The drive-thru wait is the longest! My order is never correct and very rushed at the window! I only endure it because it's \"convenient\"."}
{"text":"Although there are already multiple locations around town and have been long established in California, my first two visits has been at this location since it has recently opened up in the airport area.  Initially the prices here a sort of high for a fast food place and the food is comparable to Denny's, but not necessarily sit down since you order at the counter.  However, they do serve you the food and the employees go around asking the patrons if they need anything else with their meal. On a brighter note the quality of the food makes up for the price and I can say you get your money's worth, which would make me pick this place over Denny's. They also have a yelp check in burger combo for only $5.50, which I have yet to try. In addition, they have daily specials, which also makes it more affordable.  I like the decor of the inside which is definitely a step up from all fast food joints because it gives off the country vibe and homey feel. Farmer Boys will indeed be seeing more of me and I have already started recommending them to my family and friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat as a teenager in California! Man was I stoked to find one out here in Las Vegas. The food is just as I remembered! Great service, great food. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Drive Thru: Food came out hot and juicy! I got the club and it was delicious, with some french fries. Fries are whatever but I love how the food is always consistent other than most fast food joints."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. I absolutely love their burgers, and the Honey Dijon Chicken Sandwich was delicious! Unfortunately, those were the only things that I liked. Their shakes are overpriced and DQ makes better ones. Also, there onion rings were pretty bland. This one is hit and miss for me."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is OK for a change. Nothing spectacular here, just good food, good price. I do find that they slop too much mustard on the burgers.  Not one of the top burger places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good quality produce/food a little pricey for fast food but worth it for the quality. & they post calories for all menu items/options clearly in their menu, + breakfast all day... Winning!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant, because it's right near my house and I love burgers! Unfortunately, I didn't love these burgers. They were good... but they were just good. It was a little bland, and definitely overpriced for what you get. For two burger meals, our total came to around 18$. I like that the burgers were a high quality beef, but the seasoning just was not there. The french fries were nothing special.   The service was also not great. We waited over ten minutes in the drive-thru. We saw people being served inside the restaurant, multiple employees standing around, and no one was able to even give us a heads up that our order would be taking a long time, or how long it would take, etc. It was the longest I've waited in a drive-thru line (yes, even including in-n-out) in a long time, and it was frustrating."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys has some good food.  I enjoy their cheeseburger and their Farmer Boys burger.  Their fries are good as well.  However, their food is not worth driving across town for, and they don't always pay attention to special orders (like when you say you're allergic to onions and they bring out a tray with 2 huge onion rings in the middle of it).  The thing that sets them apart and gets them up to the 3 stars is the huge fried zucchini they offer as 1 of your sides."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming to this location for breakfast with my family. Walked in around 9. There were only 3 other people  there.  Waited over 30 minutes and still no food. Everyone who had come  behind us had been sever already. Asked for refund and manager started yelling at everyone in Spanish, then told us we should wait a few more minutes. I told her to put my food on a plate right now and give it to me. She couldn't because it was never made... so then i got my money back. Will never come to farmer boys again"}
{"text":"So, have really liked Farmer Boys for quite a while. The only thing I usually get is the BBQ ranch chicken salad. The Decatur location is hit or miss. The Rainbow location is always on it. Tried the Henderson location today. Wth? Is customer service not allowed here? Is happiness frowned upon? Is communication non existent? Do they know they're a service industry? Ordered my salad at the drive thru. 16 minutes later I'm wondering if they had to kill the chicken. I start just staring into the window and there's 4 employees standing by the drive thru window looking very upset. One girl keeps looking at me and shaking her head no. Does that mean no salad for you! Or drive on or what?  So at 22 minutes I say screw this and go inside. I ask if I have a salad or should I get a refund. I was told, \"the kitchen doesn't know what they're doing.\" Then she walks off. Another girl brings me the salad a few minutes later and shoves it at me and does not say one word. Wow...quite a place you've got there! I won't be back."}
{"text":"This Farmer Boys is just great! I enjoy coming here for breakfast and lunch. Currently they are running a breakfast special, you get 3 eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast for only $7! Oh and you get a drink too! :) For lunch they have great burgers and salads. I come here so often that I downloaded their VIF Loyalty Club app and I get special deals and collecting points which I can redeem later for another meal. The service is fast, everyone is pleasant and food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I come through the drive-through every two weeks like clockwork to pick up the same order every single time. Two Southwest salads one without avocado. The order is simple, but the food is delicious and I can depend on its quality.  Coming to Farmer Boys you can expect incredible food and if you're like us and order the same thing over and over again there were no surprises to what it's going to look feel and taste like. It's something you can look forward to and not be let down. Also, the portions are in Normas! I can never finish an entire salad, so I love that I'm able to get a dinner and a lunch out of each meal.  A few times we ventured off of our beaten trail and ordered a burger, delicious. We've also ordered some of the sides the Fried items like zucchini sticks. I don't recommend the zucchini sticks, as they are cut far too large and it's just not an enjoyable experience. Some of the zucchinis are cooked perfectly and some not cooked well at all, it's not seasoned correctly. I've had better.  The ingredients here are always fresh, crisp and you can tell that the meal is handcrafted with care. I don't like spicy things, but the chipotle ranch they give you with the southwest salad is an absolute delight.  Something else we like are the milkshakes. My husband loves the cookies and cream and I love a simple chocolate shake. The consistency is thick but not too thick and it's perfectly Rich.  I love that they are open from 6 AM to 10 PM every single day. This means that even if I'm running late at night I can still stop and pick up a healthy dinner that's going to be a wonderful choice for us and delicious!  The staff is always smiling and extremely friendly. They're not just trying to push you through the door, but seem to be invested in your dining experience.  Farmer Boys loses one star in its wait times. Whether dining inside or drive-through, you should allow yourself plenty of time to wait. At times this is very frustrating, but then I realize that with high-quality ingredients and consistency, it's worth the wait.   We will absolutely continue to rely on Farmer Boys for a delicious on the go option. Thanks for delivering such incredible quality"}
{"text":"This is not you just ordinary fast food place. I love farmer boys  an every time I have come here wether it be taking it home or eating it there it has always been great food. I have tried just about everything except breakfast. The hamburgers are so good an full of flavor an juicy an the zucchini sticks are yumm with ranch dressing. One of my favorites is the Farmer Cobb salad. It's filled with grilled chicken, bacon, avocados, tomatoes an boiled eggs. It's always fresh an looks an tastes amazing. The blt is also s good one to try.  The service is fast an great an it's always clean an nice when we eat in. I'm always ringing that bell lolll...I also like the fact they have  rewards program for every 60 points earned you get 5 bucks. So scan those receipts because it adds up quick. So great by there an check it out. Great food smells great an great service"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now on two separate occasions and both experiences were subpar to any standards whatsoever.  1) When someone orders well done, it means absolutely no pink at all!  Both times, it had minor pink and I didn't find out until I got home.  2) When guests are in a hurry and they want to go through a drive thru, don't ask them to be inconvenienced by parking in front of the store, just so you can get fake speed of service times down to a low.  Both times that happened to me and the last time I told the employee at the window, hell no I'm not being I inconvenienced, because I'm headed in a different direction.  3) Salads are not house made as they claim.  They are pre-packaged and didn't taste good.  Thankfully I was victim only twice and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Been there quite a few times for breakfast. Each and every time order hash browns well done ground throughout. They never get it right. Even the second plate of hash browns that brought out were still White. Too bad I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Burgers are on the o.k. side and they are made to order. Really dislike the onion rings. They are too big and hold a lot of water. Breakfast is the better part of the menu."}
{"text":"I told my boyfriend to just bring me back something when he was out, he knew I was on a cheeseburger kick, so he brought me a bacon cheeseburger and fries from Farmer Boys . This cheeseburger was pretty damn good . The fries were good as well . Oddly enough, my favorite was the ranch . It's not easy to find good ranch around . I'll def be needing another visit next time I go to Vegas !"}
{"text":"Brought my Mom here a couple of month's back because I heard good things about it. It's pretty cool and every time I come, it is packed! That's a good sign, right?  I've had the chicken sandwich that comes with bacon and it was pretty darn good. I ordered the zucchini sticks as a side and I have to admit, I was not a fan. The second time, they had a burger special so I tried it. It was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The fries were amazing though.   I signed up for their VIP club app on my phone, meaning I will be back. They have pretty decent food. I've had better, but it's not bad. I'd recommend as a place to feed the hunger pangs, not to savor the flavor."}
{"text":"Service drive through has no customer service what so ever and burgers suppose to beat competitors but I make way better burgers than this place...no no no to this place again!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am always greeted right away with a warm smile and happy faces. Its like you already know they want to make sure you receive excellent customer service. In my community to me this is important it means this establishment cares about there customers. When I order they get it right, even if farmer boys has an off day and they don't get my order right they always apologize and fix any issues at hand. No questions asked. But Today I was given excellent customer service! Food was prompt, delicious and warm as always! I always come here on my lunch when I hit this side of town. So if you are looking for friendly service, excellent staff and delicious food you will want to come here. Very clean facility to for you germaphobes lol"}
{"text":"I love Farmer Boys. They have great food. It's pretty expensive depending on what your getting though. I love their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"This about as good as it gets for burgers, fries, onion rings, Salads. Not a bar, more like a counter service fast food restaurant, with a drive thru.  But as good as bar food gets (as good as Kilroy's used to be (on Buffalo, now closed, been to Grand Canyon location, not as good).  Been twice, had the Onion Rings both times, excellent large, cooked to order (or they tasted super fresh and crispy), served with ranch (don't really need it).  Had the Double Cheeseburger and my wife had the Farmer Burger (Dbl CB with Avocado slices, and sauce). Good.  Fries are excellent, hot crispy and not breaded (Burger King, I'm talking to you!)  2nd visit had the BBQ (fried) Chicken salad, super fresh salad with plenty of tomatoes, bacon, BBQ sauce, onion straws, and ranch dressing. Wife had Cobb salad. Both were good.  Would like to try their shakes for desert, but I'm always too full.  Good value, about $25-30 for 2."}
{"text":"My first time trying it nothing great.. waited 20min on drive tru just 4 cars.. Pricey not happy.im not coming back.theres nothing wow ! About them i can get this food elsewhere.215/rainbow location no napkins and condiments.really?"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 30 mins for my scrambled eggs, beacon, hash browns and toast. And when asked about it, manager tells me that they will make it right now. Didn't offer any apologies or anything. Will NEVER come here again...."}
{"text":"So, I have become somewhat obsessed with Farmer Boys Chopped Cobb Salad.  It is so good.  If I \"forget\" my lunch, I like to drive to Farmer Boys. No doubt that I am a bit lazy and prefer the drive thru to getting out of my car.  I think that you can to understand that its not fast food so be prepared to wait for a bit for your food (either in the drive thru or inside).    If you are a frequent flyer, download the app.  It's a bit singular in it's purpose, but I keep getting coupons.  $2 off for loyalty. Free shake because it's Farmer Boys half birthday.  Free onion rings with purchase of burger.  Back to the cobb salad.  The ranch dressing is made there.  It is so good.  I turn the little cup upside down on the salad to make sure that I get every drop out.  The bacon is real and good pieces.  I love having avocado in the salad.  The chicken, the cheese, the egg....oh, I guess there is lettuce under all that good stuff.    I just love that all of the ingredients are fresh.  It's so hard to find a salad that every component part tastes amazing. I've been to countless places where I end up tossing the last 1/3 of the salad because they put crappy lettuce or other unacceptable quality in a salad.  I understand that people love Farmer Boys for the amazing burgers, but just haven't ordered.  I have had a couple of the tasty sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excelente y muy rico la atenciÃ³n , al mil. Ideal para disfrutar con la familia mmmmm muy rico !!!"}
{"text":"Those of you who have read my reviews in the past know I am all about customer service. This place sucked very disappointed. I went to the one in north Las Vegas and they would not honor my YELP 20% off coupon. It is on their yelp page. Extremely rude and the cashier said she didn't know how to use the coupon. The food was ok. Of course the nasty attitude of the staff didn't help. So I won't be going back very disappointed"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. Got stuck in the drive though for 25 mins!  This is ridiculous. We will never stop by here again. And to top it off the girl at the window was rude.  Food was cold.  I have been here before and the service was not this bad. Do yourself a favor and just stop at Taco Bell  did I mention I was stuck in the drive through for 25 mins!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Farmer Boys. It's newer than the one located on Lamb Blvd, seems bigger and more open, the staff happier and always ready to help, service super fast. What else can you ask for?   Came here for the first time today for lunch. Ordered a Bell ringer burger , chopped Cobb salad, a Southwest chicken salad and 7 pcs fried zucchini. Our food came fast and we started chowing those delicious fried zucchinis when I noticed there were only 4 instead of 7, so I informed one of the staff and she said she'll take care of it. A few minutes later she comes back with 7 pcs of freshly fried zucchinis. Told her we only needed 3 but she said it's their mistake so they wanted us to have it. Nice right?  Anywhoooo, everything was delicious! We took leftovers home. If you've ever been to a Farmer Boys, you know they have huge servings.  Very happy with the food and service. We'll definitely be back.   Shoutout to Marisa for an awesome service."}
{"text":"So came here for lunch today. I was so torn between the clam chowder and  their new fish and fries. In the end, Fish and chips won by very small margin. Of course we had to give the fried zucchinis another try and a Cobb salad for the hubby.  Line at midday was almost to the door but it went by fast. Took a while to get our food but that too is understandable. However, by the time we got it, my fries were cold already :( . Anyway, the Cobb salad was as usual fresh and good, the fried zucchinis were so much better than the last time we got them. The breading stayed intact and the zucchinis were still crunchy. The fish, unfortunately wasnt very good. They were heavily battered. I took out most of the breading/coating to get to the fish and like my fries, they were barely warm too. Should have gone with the clam chowder instead.   We're giving them a 3.5* this time around."}
{"text":"I've never been to Farmer Boys so I thought I'd give it a try. The location is great, because it's on the SW side of Vegas and that's near me. I was originally going to go to Mcdonalds which is right next to it, but decided to give Farmer boys a try and it was the right choice.   I ordered the bacon turkey melt which was roughly $6 and my friend got the Big cheese combo which was $10. My sandwich was good, the burger was better, and the fries were okay not salty enough in my opinion. I don't feel like the combo was worth the price. We went through the drive through and waited about 7 minutes for them to give us our food.   This place seems really nice overall and I'll probably go back to try their other burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"This location just opened this week and they don't have things together yet. We were very excited that it was opening within walking distance to our house so we tried it last night. We have been driving to the one on Decatur since we moved here 6 years ago so we expected the same quality of food and service.  We have many complaints about our experience. 1. The look is more modern and attractive but the wide open concept with all hard surfaces was very noisy even though there were few customers inside. 2. Ordering was a bit frustrating, I have always ordered the meal deal they have on the menu but the guy taking the order didn't understand how to do it.  2. We are used to receiving our order in about 5 minutes. After about 10 minutes we started to watch for our food and noticed a lot of orders going out the drive thru window. My sandwich came 14 minutes after we ordered it and my wife's omelet came 4 minutes later. Everyone else who was waiting inside had similar delays.  3.It was 50 degrees windy and rainy outside and not much warmer inside. As we left we were both cold from siting inside and I noticed that every diner still had their jackets on and at least 2 employees were wearing jackets over their uniforms. By the time I got to the last few bites of my sandwich it had gone from warm to almost refrigerator cold. 4. The food quality was not up to the standard we are used to from this chain. Instead of the normal sliced Avocado on her omelet she received a it mashed up in a plastic cup on the side.   If this had been our first experience we would never come back but since we know this chain we will probably come back in a few months to see if they have improved. Until then it will be a 4 mile drive to Decatur for Farmer Boys."}
{"text":"The distance is a huge disadvantage, but the grub is worth the drive! I had the small portion of fish and chips (subbing onion rings for the fries) and still couldn't finish it. The batter was light and flaky, not greasy and overdone. If they could only reduce the calorie content so I didn't have guilt after, I would have given it five stars. Either way, I'll make the drive and go back!"}
{"text":"Mixed review here. The Farmer's Burger is my husbands new favorite. Double patty, cheese, bacon, guacamole, and he is in love. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was ....just ok. For both our meals was $20 bucks, We both got chili cheese fries, I told the guy please no onions since I was allergic and after eating a few fries I discovered huge onion chucks so I traded for zucchini fries, also kind of blah. I guess we will stick to the burgers if we go back. Service was friendly, and not long of a wait."}
{"text":"I moved from Southern California about 12 years ago and the things I miss most are the weather and the greasy burger joints that are on every block. I have yet to find anything that even comes close until now. This is exactly what a burger should be greasy, messy and unbelievable good!!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, they have a good selection of healthy meals. Whenever I stop by to pick up something quick it's always top quality food and my orders have always been 100% correct. I have tried about 5 different meals   1. The Natural Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger.  2.The French Toast Combo  3.The Breakfast Burrito with Sausage  4. The Farmers Chopped Cobb Salad  5. CA BLT   You can't go wrong with anything from farmer boys. I always try to get something with Bacon, Avocado and egg when I'm here because they are a great combo :)   They have great seating indoors, the atmosphere is warm and inviting. They have a lot to look at on the walls, a fun thing to do when your waiting for your food."}
{"text":"I always order either a barbecue chicken salad or a veggie burger. I've never been disappointed it's always been perfect for me. I mostly enjoy the salad and it appears that a lot of other people that I bring their also enjoy the salads. It's a very clean place, the service is as fast as it can be because it is not a fast food restaurant, the cleanliness is wonderful and the restrooms are always clean. People are very helpful and always cheerful and willing to help me in any way. I am there at least one to two times a week. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I love Farmer Boys, but this location is all over the place!! Third time I've been here and my order was wrong again!!!"}
{"text":"Zucchini - great! Salad - good Farmers Burger - good But the service by these young kids, especially Leilani and Holli was outstanding. They seemed very attentive to our needs and we watched as they were constantly keeping the place clean and tidy. It's great seeing kids appreciate what they do for a change."}
{"text":"Just ordered through the drive thru about 20 minutes ago. I ordered two burgers and 1 clam chowder. (Last time I came here the clam chowder came in a bigger bowl) Today they gave me the clam chowder in a small bowl, with only celery and broccoli. Yeah broccoli, it had no \"clam\" so why do they call it clam chowder. They threw some cheddar cheese on top but I never asked for that. Last but not least, long line for them to get my order wrong. Last time I come here."}
{"text":"Horrible! Just arrived home to find a hair in my cheeseburger. So disappointing because this isn't the first time I've been let down by this location. Last time I came through the drive through and got a burger, it was completely soggy by the time I arrived home, 5 minutes away. This time i asked for the sauce on the side to eliminate the sogginess and now it's a hair in my food. Disgusting and I will never return. I don't recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat. Staff was friendly and the food was good . The menu had alot to choose from. The prices were not that bad."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food could be good, but if the service and management is poor then the place is worthless. Tonight our family, six of us placing three orders for dinner.   All three orders had issues, wrong food, wrong table, cold food, etc. Once it was settled I asked the server Brittney, what happened to my meal. She removed my number 19 from the table now will they bring the food. To answer that question. It was never brought to the table although I did pay for the order $9.74, I guess I can consider that money gone since it was delivered to me. At 20 minutes I got up went to the counter and furious mad as now the other five at the table have finished there dinner and I have not even got my.   Yes, I raised my voice and made sure everyone all three other tables knew there was a problem. I blame your manager, and most of all the server for such poor service. I can just imagine the problems in the restaurant. At 3  minutes I finally got mine when all the other's were finished eating, now they got to watch me have mine! How RUDE! I asked the manager more then once for the franchise owner's contact information. Never provided it. In fact as far as I am concerned he just ignored me. Prior to leaving he saw me at the end of the counter where the business license and other documents are posted on the wall, he saw me copying the information and asked me if there was anything he could do. Again, I was fuming mad and told him no I would contact your corporate, when he finally gave me a card with number written on it but at that point I already got it. I told him if he was anything of a good manager he would have apologized for the problem but never did, instead he made a statement about the way I was raising my voice so he did nothing.   There is no excuse to be forgotten! How would you feel! You paid, you asked and then forget you again! I would be very surprised if Farmer Boys Corp office attempts to contact. I have been a customer of Farmer Boys ever since they opened the location at Perris Blvd and Caljalco Expressway in Perris. I promise you, I am done with Farmer Boys!"}
{"text":"For a fast food place the service is awesome.   For any place the service was awesome.   Went in right before closing and the staff was awesome.  We kept looking at the menu after we ordered and the employee offered us a pamphlet for to go orders.  He also explained menu items to me.    The have a good selection of food.  I had corn chowder and a Cobb salad wrap. The pricing was spot on and the place was very clean.  I felt very valued and respected as a customer so shout out to the night crew.   I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the best staffed most well run farmer boys I've been to in the valley.  They appreciate tips but not required but did really appreciate having someone walk over to refill my coffee at breakfast time...   convenient location.  Breakfast specials Monday through Friday are on point for the budget, download their app it's worth it..."}
{"text":"I tried it with Sharon who was skeptical and wanted to go to jolibee. I don't eat banana ketchup, so Farmer boys it is.  The place had clean restrooms and down home decor.  I guess some people can't get the Thunderbirds theme. Anyway on to the food. I had the double bacon cheese burger with onion rings and a peanut butter milkshake. The burger does have a juice issue, but better than greasy In n out. The onion rings ok, the milkshake was pretty damn good and I can't even do dairy. Overall the food was good and the price was right."}
{"text":"Since this is partially a breakfast place,  I expected it to have many options without meat or meat sides. Even the French toast and pancakes were paired with two sides of meat. I was hungry though so I got a side of fries and a strawberry milkshake. The fries were grainy and tasted stale which makes no sense because I waited 10 minutes in an empty restaurant for them so I expected them to taste fresh but they were also such a small swerving, there was 10 fries. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the milkshake was really really good."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys has left me a little disappointed in the past, but I have come to the conclusion that I was just ordering the wrong things!   While the burgers don't do much for me, I have grown to enjoy a few of the other sandwiches, wraps and breakfast items Farmer Boys offers. I also like that if I get a craving for bacon and eggs at 4 in the afternoon, I can get it at Farmer Boys, they serve up breakfast all day, every day.  I am really glad I gave Farmer Boys another try because while I'll never get a burger from there again, I will gladly enjoy one of their turkey wraps or bacon breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Every so often when I am heading out of town on the I-15, I will stop at this Farmer Boys to get a meal to go. My most recent visit was on a Friday around 6 pm.   My husband ordered  grilled chicken sandwich and fries, I had the California BLT. We each had an order of fries, and I had an iced tea. A full 20 minutes after I placed the order, I observed a woman that had been waiting when I arrived go up to the cashier to cancel her order. A few minutes later, the manager sent an employee over to ask what I had ordered. Not a good sign.   I could deal with paying $20 and waiting almost 30 minutes to get our food, if it was good. However, it was not. My husband's chicken was extremely dry and the condiments were only on about 1/3 of the bun. The bread on my sandwich was soggy. The avocado that made my BLT a California BLT was almost non-existent. Both sandwiches seemed like they were thrown together as quickly as possible, which was a disappointment after waiting so patiently for so long.   I hate writing this review, because to me it appeared that all of the employees at Farmer Boys were working hard... But my watch, wallet and tastebuds were all disappointed with this experience. I don't expect to ever go back."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and ordered three of the bacon cheeseburger specials plain for 6.49 each. Bill came to $30 I looked at it and said why as three do not add up to $30. The cashier charged full price. You have to really watch your bill here.  Now to the food, no taste, overcooked and had pickles on them. I layer them on the table as I cannot have. We ate and stacked the trays and started talking a lady came and picked up the trays and said with attitude pick up those pickles.  First we would of taken the trays to the trash ourselves after we'd finished talking and second when we got up we would of cleaned the table off as we always do anywhere we go.  She was so rude and had an attitude problem."}
{"text":"The Charbroiled Chicken sandwich is so good! Stay away from the chili though. The bread bowl it came in was awesome. The chili, not so much."}
{"text":"Food was good, I ordered the 4 piece fish, and half went home for tomorrow, wife got breakfast, tasted good, and she helped with my fries, son got the kids meal with grilled cheese... was decent until we found a black shirt and curly hair in it!!?!? I gave it to the employee  then told him the employees should wear hair nets and he did nothing but take the apple with the hair on it.. shame on them."}
{"text":"Always love the food, but the drive thru tonight is going on 20 minutes, that's ordering to the window, we only ordered 2 farmer burgers and some zucchini still haven't seen food :/  Update: they handed us 1 free meal ticket for the wait. Putting 4th star back for that. No food after 30 minutes still... We have been asked to pull up to the front of the building.. What gives? :("}
{"text":"I'm going to chalk this review up to growing pains and I promise to revisit this location again soon, but my first visit to Farmer Boys was less than successful. I'm so happy to have a nice new burger joint on the Southwest side of town, but this place was more of a miss than a hit with me. And I know my burgers!   Let's start with the positives: the place is spotlessly clean. I mean \"I'd have zero qualms about eating off the floor\" kind of clean. That's a pretty major feat considering I visited at 12:30 on a Tuesday during peak lunch rush hour. The place was packed, there wasn't any seating, but it was super clean. The interior design is very welcoming and comfortable too...if you can find a seat! I asked for my burger wrapped in lettuce low carb style and there was no confusion, so yay for that.    Now for the not so good: the menu is a little confusing if you are a first timer. Step back and really study it. Lots of choices, and it doesn't make sense what you get with what. Like can I have fried zucchini if I get a combo, and how many do I get? Nobody could give me a definitive answer. The employees were confused too -- they didn't know what was supposed to come on my burger (and subsequently left the avocado off of my avocado burger). We also had to ask several times for silverware and a side of mayonnaise. When I finally got the kitchen to give me the missing avocado, I was handed a cup of mashed up avocado instead of the pretty slices shown on the menu photos. It still tasted good so I didn't care, but I think this is worth noting.   None of these complaints are that serious, but there was one big problem with my meal: it simply didn't taste very good. The food tasted fresh, but it was so bland. It was like the cook forgot to season my meat and zucchini. It was so weird! I don't cook with salt at home -- I actively avoid eating it -- but I had to reach for the salt (something I NEVER do). Freddy's, Fatburger and Smashburger all make more delicious burgers.   I really want to give Farmer Boys another chance, and I think they deserve one. But I wanted to share my first impressions for now."}
{"text":"Had our first ever faux pas with customer service here. Our son ordered the split side of onion rings and french fries. The cashier repeated said order correctly but seems to have rung it up incorrectly, only charging us for fries. Our meals arrive at our table in a timely fashion but he has only fries. My husband asks our server to bring the 2 onion rings we ordered.  Server goes away, comes back and asks to see our receipt, he hand it over and we're told we were only charged for fries but they would bring the onion rings if we pay for them. Really? We ordered the combo side..cashier repeated ir back as the combo...we think we've paid for said combo side. Is this franchise so cheap they can't cough up 2 freakin onion rings to kerp guests happy?   May find new store next time we want burgers. Sorry Farmer Boys but EPIC FAIL!"}
{"text":"sooooo slooooow ... 25 Minutes in the drive through - Hire MORE or BETTER employees OR O wait -  I can eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"ummm not only did they not allow my $3 off coupon in the drive thru but when i got home i seen this is my sandwhich. i called and talked to a manager and they refunded my total amount. i will not be eating at any farmer boy location again. the kitchen they use is obviously disgusting."}
{"text":"We were driving around town last night, and came to this great fast food restaurant. The people were VERY friendly, and did not treat us with anything less than respect and appreciation.  Their daily deals work out great. I ordered a Chicken Wrap with Clam Chowder as my side. The Clam Chowder was very tasty, and overall great. As for the chicken wrap, I thought it was very tasty, but a little dry. It had chicken, cheese, lettuce and some ranch.  Inside Farmer Boys, the atmosphere was very welcoming. It was clean and decorated, with a family feel. The seats were comfortable, and the people working there were great!  Overall, great experience, as I plan to be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times and it's never consistent. I absolutely loveee the Fried zucchini sticks and onion rings and order them every time I've come. The last visit I had I came around 11:50pm which is closing time. I ordered my usual zucchini and onion rings. When I got home the zucchini wasn't cooked! The batter was still raw and the zucchini itself was hard from not being fully cooked. I called in the morning and they offered to replace my order. The order they replaced it with was over cooked!!  It's so disheartening since I really liked this place. I will most likely never return since you never know what you are going to get."}
{"text":"We always go here as a family for whatever time of day it is. They serve breakfast all day so it can be perfect hangover food also. Haha  Today we ordered the bacon boy combo with onion rings, the avocado bacon combo with fried zucchini, (both are burgers) and for our son we usually get him chicken fingers but we decided on the grilled cheese with fries this time. All combos come with drink.  When you receive your order you will notice it's a HUGE amount! They are known for there hormone free burgers and they are amazing! Now when you come here I HIGHLY recommend the fried zucchini it is the best I have ever had and I can't order it anywhere else. It's literally a whole zucchini they cut into 4 slices for you and fry.  One last thing I love this location, the decor is \"country\" and all the staff are very nice, they give you as many ranches as you want and are always checking in on you.  P.s. There is also a drive through! And don't forget to grab a punch card so you can get a free side and then a free combo!"}
{"text":"This place is so good my mouth waters thinking about it. Everything is always so fresh and exceeds my standards for a fast food burger by a lot. I always get the charbroiled chicken club and the zucchini is to die for!!"}
{"text":"My first time at FarmerBoys, just so so. The Pastrami sandwich was good as was the milkshake. The onion rings on the other hand, were terrible. The cracked corn coating was very thin and fell right off   Had to wait in line after being served to ask for mustard and a fork. This was a 5 minute wait for items that should be readily available for customers.   Not sure if I'll be coming g back."}
{"text":"Meh! First time here and it wasn't the greatest at all. I got the California Omelet which was a joke. Flat omelet and nothing to go crazy about.   My bf ordered the country fried chicken and that was actually real good.  Not sure I would come here again at least to get breakfast items."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  Don't come here, messed up order, super slow service n worst of all, cockroach on our table!"}
{"text":"First time here and it will be my last. Came in with my coworkers & it was the worst experience ever. I ordered the barn burner & when the shift leader brought it to my table I could see the blood dripping from my burger so when I cut it in half it was still raw and the fries were cold. When I took the burger back the shift leader just took it from me & had the cashier refund me my money. Gonzalo  the shift leader didn't even apologize instead walked away. He apologized once I asked for his name. They served my co workers fruit bowls that had bad oranges & grapes & they even forgot my coworkers shake. Worst experience ever will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here. Wow! Very impressed. Excellent food huge selection breakfast and lunch. Service is fantastic and the restaurant is very clean!!! Will definitely be back! so good!"}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews. Ate here many many times and the food is always excellent. Orders have never been messed up and if it was I'm positive they would fix it. Should definitely try it if you haven't already.  Another great breakfast by Farmer Boys! Everything was delicious as can be. Employees made us feel so welcomed and valued. There's is absolutely nothing bad about our visit today. Is and will always be our favorite breakfast place in town. Keep up the good work! See ya soon. Highly recommend:  -3 egg breakfast sunny side up, white toast, bacon and hash browns. - chili cheese fries with onion's are always delicious. - any shake on the menu"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. My first and last visit to Farmer Boys! It was really bad! The Club sandwich was horrible! Who puts pressed turkey and ham on a club sandwich??? It even tasted cheap, and they charged $11.99 for a combo. I could have payed less than that at any restaurant in Vegas and actually got real turkey."}
{"text":"Awful. Complained to corporate. They screwed up my order twice. Food made me sick. Tip: don't order the zucchini batons. They're gross."}
{"text":"So apparently if you order two breakfast burritos exactly the same way one of them is going to have everything in it that its suppressed to come with... like cheese.... and the other one will only be eggs and potatoes. Dry enough choke a damn camel.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Met a client here for B fast. I like this location and the access is easy to get in & out of. Another positive is the have a large selection of specials and everything is cooked fresh to order.  I went for the breakfast combo and chose to add pancakes a minimal charge. The sausage are served as patties and were lean, eggs cooked medium and the pancakes yummy.   Service here by the entire staff was friendly and they are were constantly refilling our the coffee cups.  I was so satisfied I brought additional clients the following day."}
{"text":"First, I am a fan of Farmer Boy's. I've been to several of them throughout California. So what went wrong today, well I walked in and I waited and waited, then walked up to the line for the counter, one person in front of me being helped. What did I wait for, they always say hello when I walk through the door? Then someone usually walks up to the counter and says may I help you. No, I had to wait for the one cashier, even though they had employees all over the place.  I get up to the counter and I am greeted, oh okay. Then another employee walks by and says hello. So, maybe I was judging too quickly. My food came out and the French fries were ice cold. No one ever asked if I needed a refill on my drink. The burger had too much sauce on it, and it was runny. But it still tasted good. Then the big thing, no cow bell at the door when you exit?  I don't know, I come to expect certain things.  I would like to add that I have gotten 5 star service at Loma Linda and Clovis Farmer Boys."}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, the burgers at Farmer Boys are fine but not my favorite. I feel they are over priced for what they are. But honestly I just come in for the zucchini. The burgers are just to make a more proper meal. On my trip last night even the zucchini was kind of disappointing. The first two pieces were great. Firm. Hot. Crispy. Exactly what I love so much about it. The third piece was on the soggy side but still good. My fourth and final piece was horrid. It was a limp mass of green yuck. The breading wouldn't even stick to it. And the seeds underneath the breading were brown. I feel that piece of zucchini was either left out too long or wasn't a good squash to begin with. Either way I did not eat that last piece.  In the end, a big burger and the three pieces of zucchini I did eat were filling. The restaurant, which looks like Grandma's dining room back in the country, was not very clean. There was a lot of crap on the floors. Mostly burger toppings. Many of the tables were not clean. And the trash cans were about over flowing. I think they were understaffed. The girl working the counter was also the one trying to stock the table condiments and sweep between customers. One person can't do it all. She tried though. I giver her credit for that."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Farmer Boy's for a long time  but I am not sold yet on this establishment.  First, while it may look like a fast food restaurant, it feels very much more akin to a sit down restuarant like Denny's.  The drive-thru took what felt like forever and the hit to my wallet felt  too severe for what I received.  All I got was a single chceese burger combo with half and half fried zucchini and onion rings.  I think it was almost $10.  I want to like the onion rings with their corn meal coating and I kind of do but it lacked enough flavor and the coating just came off.  I ended up eating the onions and coating seperate from one another.  How unfortunate.  The zucchini, on the other hand, was very good.  Probably the best food I had here.  The coating stayed on and the ranch dressing on the side was perfect.  I also like the fact that the zucchini was in long strips rather than small pieces.  The burger was nearly a disappointment.  It was cold by the time I got home. Perhaps it took me too long to get home. Whatever the case, the meat was kind of dry and little tough.  Not quite what I expected.  On the subject of taste, I was reminded of Fat Burger.  This is not necessarily a bad thing but with a price that rivals Fat Burger I would expect better quality to equal each other. Maybe I'll give them another try some time. I've seen other locations. Maybe this one, the newest to Las Vegas, is still reaching its stride. You know what they say, there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"I really like their sandwiches and the freshly squeezed orange juice!! Feels much healthier to eat at this place."}
{"text":"I've always been happy with the service I've had at every Farmers Boys I've been to, but I have to give a special shout out to the crew at the Tropical Parkway location out in the Northwest of Las Vegas. Every time I've been there, the service has been fantastic. I can't remember their names, but one if the guys that works the register is always keeping busy. If he's not running the register, he's topping off coffees or cleaning up. One time, I forgot to order fries and the manager totally hooked me up. Going the extra mile in customer service like this is impressive in today's culture. Nicely done."}
{"text":"I know this location has a ton of mixed reviews but I honestly have never had a problem here. I work down the street on the AFB and I put in large to go orders.  The staff has always been very friendly to me which I appreciate. I  have been coming here over a year and non of my orders have ever been wrong and the temperature of the food is perfect as well. Bacon cheese burgers with guacamole is my go to lunch item with a side of zucchini. And let me tell you those zucchini sticks are huge.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel the prices are just a little steep."}
{"text":"Just want to let you know that Arora at farmboys is like amazing she goes over and above she's help me on several occasions I go there two to three times a week and she is absolutely phenomenal kudos to you girl keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I want to give the food a 3 because it is kind of a greasy-spoon type place, but the service was a 100 out of 5.  Every single person who worked here was amazing!  And you don't write tips on the credit card receipt?  Here is one place I actually felt like the employees were just going out of their way to be friendly and make you happy and they deserve all the tips anyone can give them.  One example is I made a comment to my husband that I was looking for malt vinegar.  Well five minutes later I am at my table and a girl comes by with packets of malt vinegar for me.  Um I didn't even know she or any employee heard me!  I certainly didn't ask them for it and I don't even remember seeing her hear me!  That is truly above and beyond service if you ask me.  I ate a California blt which was okay.  The California part is where they had guacamole on the sandwich.  Next time I would request plain avocado rather then guacamole.  I also had a side salad with blue cheese dressing and I ate a bite of what my husband had but unfortunately due to pregnant-brain I can't remember what that was.  I also had an order of four onion rings.  The onion rings were pretty good and giant!  One thing that unnerved me while I was here was almost every patron was heavy.  I wish Centennial Hills had more healthy options to eat.  It kind of made me scared to come back because I don't want to be unhealthy.  Anyways, I hope that doesn't sound ignorant since I am gaining weight by the day.  There were a lot of menu options that sounded great like fried zucchini sticks and a fish and chips dinner."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this burger company look good and i thought it might be alright but it was terrible! My burger was so cooked its possible it wasnt beef, that and the menu had so little options all the burger choices are boring and bland. It was dry and way too expensive for the quality i would definitely recommend going to Five Guys or In & Out instead way better options for way better burgers and cheaper too."}
{"text":"Fan of Farmer Boys but not this location.    1/22/2018 Our second bad/slow service visit to this location.  We have been here on previous visits and at other locations in Las Vegas.  We normally order the same thing so we know the normal wait times, portion sizes, etc.  This was two in a row with bad service.  We thought the first time was just a bad day or something?  Food came, visibly smaller portions.  They forgot the avocado on the salad.  They did bring some out after we pointed it out.  No ketchup on table.  Resorted to self serve at this point.  Went to a vacant table with a bottle, but that bottle was empty.  The next table I table I tried had a bottle with some in it.  Perhaps that lead to looking at other things.  We most likely will not return to this location....sadly since it is the most convenient.  Things we found unacceptable, that we have not run into at other FB's.  This encounter seemed to be the perfect storm.  (1)Inside order.  15 + minutes from order to table delivery. (2)All available booths, the tables were not clean.  Person dropping off food didn't even notice ours was not clean. (3)When food came we made a comment on portion size compared to other FB's.  Excuse was they were out of the normal size plates.  No offer to make anything right in another way. (4)No Ketchup on table.  Self serve at this point.  Went to 1st vacant table, that ketchup was empty.  Found one with some on 2nd try. (5)Forgot the avocado on the salad, had to ask for it.  Server had to go get it. (6)Bathroom (men's at least) smelly and needed cleaned.  Pursuing this with a phoned in complaint at an area or district level (whatever they may call it).  The person that answered said it might take 48 hrs to get a response.  We are on day three, and no call back.  Had they made us feel this was important we may not have placed a review at all.  1/24/2018 We went to another FB location just to make sure it wasn't our imagination. We went to the FB at W Tropical Pkwy.  Inside order.  Ordered the same exact thing.  They were fairly busy so the above was not about hitting a busy spell. Served within 6 minutes.  Normal sized portions we are used to.  Ketchup was on the table, tables were clean, and clean bathrooms.  They got everything right.  They were the opposite end of the spectrum.  We rated them as such in another review."}
{"text":"We are a fan of Farmer Boys.  We came back to this one (which is further from our house - miles further), after having two bad experiences in a row, at another location.  1/24/2018 This Tropical Pkwy location is great.  Staff is friendly.  We always order the same thing.  Inside order.  Served to table within 6 minutes, Bathroom clean, tables clean, Ketchup was on the table and adequately filled.  They didn't forget anything like tartar sauce and salad dressing.  Great experience and great food for the price."}
{"text":"I gotta say, the Farmer Burger is awesome.  I've been coming to Farmer Boys for years and have tried almost everything on the menu.  I am a fan of almost all of it, but the real reason I come here is for the Farmer Burger.  I take my wife here for breakfast, she orders a breakfast burrito, I get a Farmer burger.  I take the kids here for shakes at night, after dinner, I get a Farmer Burger.    The Farmer Burger is kind of like those Pizza Bagel things, you know...\"When Pizza's on a bagel you can eat pizza any time.\"  That's how I feel about the Farmer burger, it's good any time.    Prices are not bad, and the service is usually very good.  In case I forgot to mention, try the Farmer Burger."}
{"text":"This was my first trip here. I stopped in the restroom to wash my hands first and it was filthy. Strike One. Not a great start. The young gentleman who took my order (Keone) was professional and articulate.  My next stop was the beverage machine. There was no ice. Strike Two. Waiting for my meal I logged into the free wifi. I do like that. Heads up, the drinks here are oversized, a medium feels like a half gallon.  The Farmer Burger Combo was delivered to my table. The burger was so loaded in toppings I couldn't taste the 1/2 lb of beef. The fries were overdone. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  The combo also came with a cookie. It has been a while since I spit out a chocolate chip cookie, but this one got me to do that. Neither the texture nor the flavor was in any way good.  There are other burger joints in the neighborhood. Save yourself the gut ache and try them instead of Farmer Boys"}
{"text":"This was our first time and last time! We waited over 30 minutes for our breakfast. Finally we went up to the front to have someone checked on our food.  They  had forgotten about us. A minute later, they brought out our food. The pancakes were hard as a rock. The eggs were dried up. They were not busy at all. It just blew my mind!! So we left and will not be going back. They have such poor customer service. But then again, they just might have a bad management team. They need a lot more training."}
{"text":"I ordered a natural burger with NO cheese and NO bacon and fries at the drive-thru . when I paid I ask her again for no cheese or bacon , and then again when I got the food at the window . JUST to drive back home open the bag and see CHEESE in my burger !!   I ask 3 times ..  no cheese ... why is it so difficult?     I don't know if they did it on purpose or they just stupid...  I didn't even go back there the same night just threw the food to the trash ."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't quite tell what to make of it at first. The atmosphere immediately says, \"fast food,\" especially with the drive-thru, but inside the food is served on plates like any ol' diner or Denny's. Not just wrapped up on a tray. They have great breakfast deals and a wide variety of items to choose from. Husband had a Denver omelette while I had the cobb salad without avocado."}
{"text":"The service was really nice at this location. The inside was not very clean and there was not a whole lot of people inside eating. The food to a longggg time to get and really it was not thst great. This is the second time I have been in a farmer boys thst I have had something negative to say and I think that tells me to not go back and eat their food."}
{"text":"The food is so good here, plus u can get breakfast if u want and they do not just have burgers they have alot to choose from. This place is pretty busy and just opened up. The staff is pretty nice and they've pretty quick w/ur food we might have waited 5 mins. Check this new location out."}
{"text":"Absolute slowest drive thru ever! Three cars in front of me and I have been waiting for 10 minutes. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If I Could put half a Star I WOULD!!!! 1. Food not that Good for the price (high )  Not Recommend to friends or family or strangers!!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan in the least. Decided to try it because we've never been here before. First off, my burger had a hair in it, so I had to wait for them to remake my meal. Decided this place is overpriced, especially considering the sides you get with a combo meal (i.e. fried zucchini strips or onion rings) are very bland.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. This place wasn't any better than fast food, but cost at least 2-3 times as much...and doesn't even taste as good as fast food!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Farmland breakfast bowl, it was pretty tasty. I love this place because they have a variety of food from breakfast and lunch. They food is always fresh to order as well. My only concern that day was that I went to the drive thru window and there was a wait on the food. Never waited that long when I went inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually grab an Animal-Style Double-Double from In-N-Out whenever I'm in town because there isn't a location where I'm from. However, my aunt & uncle insisted I check out Farmer Boys because they said their portions are generous. They weren't kidding, but the flavors were okay-- nothing spectacular. I did like that they didn't skimp when I requested avocado, but I would've been just as content with a Quarter Pounder from McD's or a Whopper at BK. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is awesome! Good is great and service is phenomenal! Lamar makes you feel like a very valued customer. We go every time we are driving through Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We finally tried Farmer Boys... and this was a HUGE disappointment. I ordered a Natural Burger and it came out looking flat and overcooked. It was! There was absolutely zero flavor to the patty and it was dried out. The bun was plain, cold and slilghtly damp. NO tomatoes or lettuce, just a couple of tired pickle slices and some greasy mayo UNDER the meat. Huh?  The French Fries were completely tasteless and bland. Once they were luke warm, they weren't fit to eat at all. The Strawberry Milkshake was thick, but just as tasteless and bland... even with a couple of strawberries blended into it. I totally don't understand why people rave about this place. I give it 2 stars because the people working there were truly nice, especially Kalill H. who was helpful guiding us through the menu and my lunch mate really loved the fried zucchini, but the resulting food I got looked NOTHING like the yummy photos behind the counter. Maybe the Cobb Salad was okay... it looked pretty good when I saw someone eating that... but I won't be back soon. Smashburger and In-n-Out beat this place for burgers by a mile."}
{"text":"All the staff  members are friendly but Dominick & Keone are awesome !!!  Great food and great service.. We will definitely keep coming back !!"}
{"text":"The service is awful here. Always a long wait. Only been here twice, the last time  my order was wrong. The cooks look inexperienced and the front counter service was sloppy. Not worth the money. The only thing in common with other Farmer Boys in different states is the name. THIS ONE SUCKS."}
{"text":"I was so hungry that I forgot to take a picture of my dish. First time at this location and it was clean in the dining area. The staff readily greeted us with a warm welcome. We ordered the 3 egg omelet and the 3 egg breakfast. Both dishes were delicious, the omelet was the Denver style and my 3 egg were  with egg whites only and an English muffin. Tailored to youread taste, everything was hot and fresh. The coffee is a Columbian blend that is strong and tasty without cream and sugar. I will return to this location.  Watch for photos!!!"}
{"text":"Place is good, any location I've gone to seems they get pretty busy. Price is a bit higher than a burger joint but definitely better quality and wide selection of foods. Great for lunch."}
{"text":"Manager was very helpful on recommending the special of the day. Pastrami on a ciabatta roll. Very good plus the zucchini sticks to die for.. what a great lunch.. Thanks ? boys..."}
{"text":"Wow to the Wow!! Used to love Farmer Boys and the key words are used to. This place just won't get your food you ordered to you in less than 45 minutes , seriously. 2 months ago after a couple of years of eating at this location it took the 45 minutes to cook 3 frickin hamburgers and fries, I think don't go back to this one and move on with my life. Today I decided to give this location another try for breakfast and guess what...that's right 40 minutes in drive through and food still not ready. Look people, farmer boys is good food but this location is absolutely the frickin worst and actually has made me write off their food, I can get the same stuff at Santa Fe Station Grand Cafe cheaper and quicker."}
{"text":"I had ordered the Patty Melt when I had gone in the other day, it wasnt bad but it wasnt the best Ive had either. I did enjoy the bread they used and the fries were infinitley better than most fast food chains. I  I will go back and try another item from the menu, I like to keep an open mind about places and their products. Just because one item isnt a stud doesnt mean the whole menu is poop."}
{"text":"Quick and courteous service. Big portions. VERY friendly staff. Reasonably priced. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Go to Farmer Boys from time to time, mostly for the Chop Cobb salad. Service is always pretty and I don't mind waiting in the drive through a little longer than you usually would. I don't really like the burgers, they are pretty dry and I don't understand the onion rings at all. Very plain and flavorless.  Last few times I came to this location I did get watery salad dressing, especially the blue cheese. Kinda strange and unappetizing. So I would say this place is pretty hit or miss and this location is a microcosm of that."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and amazing food. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food given is well worth  it. The place well maintained too. Definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I probably just ordered the wrong item.  I think this place could have the potential to be a 3 star or even 4 star fast-food restaurant, but my experience on this trip was pretty poor.  I had a philly cheesesteak.  It was pretty tiny considering it cost $6.89 pre tax.  The bread was more of a flatbread instead of a hoagie bread; it was weird.  It was a bit heavy on the green peppers.  The cheese (provolone) to steak ratio was good though.  The meat was gross though.  It was bland and had a mushy texture.  I'm thinking that the meat was boiled instead of grilled.  My friends seemed to enjoy their burgers, but they also seemed a bit small for the over $6 price point (without fries).  The onion rings were good but once again I'm not sure if they were worth the $3.39 price.  They are huge and are an actual onion ring (not the composite mushy stuff).  I guess the rings just weren't good enough to overcome my disapointment with the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place was on the way home from California, we made a stop in Rancho Cucamonga off Route 66... So I was pretty excited that we had a few here in Vegas!  The burgers are my fav. I've tried most of them and I have no been disappointed in them at all! Their shakes are great, our favs are Coffee and Cookies and Cream or Oreo, I forget what they call theirs. They're great, creamy and they have whipped cream to top it off. Next I'm going to try the orange creamscicle thing :)  The one thing that I'd recommend to steer clear of is the Clam Chowder. It was pretty salty, thin and tasted packaged."}
{"text":"I give this location on rainbow a 3 star review because the burgers were DELICIOUS but everything else...eh. My husband and I both got the ABC (avocado, bacon, cheese) burger on opening weekend along with fries, onion rings, Diet Pepsi & Sierra Mist. As I said, the burger was phenomenal, the fries and onion rings had zero taste. Zero. We were actually surprised at that. Almost like eating plain tofu. I thought with it being opening weekend they'd be on top of their game but not with the fries and onion rings. The big plus is that they used real onions but still, no taste. Very plain. I didn't even finish the onion rings. Also, the Sierra Mist tastes like soap. So, if we decide to go back, it'll only be for the delicious burgers...nothing more."}
{"text":"While the food is generally very good, the customer service is very haphazard. I've eaten at this restaurant at least five times and every time I visit they screw something up. The last visit took the cake. We use their phone app to get rewards dollars, specials etc. we attempted to use a $10 reward on our $30 order. We also wanted to use an offer for a $1 cheeseburger that was about to expire. The cashier had no idea what she was doing and rang up the order at full price mystified as to why our $10 wasn't applied. There was no answer for the $4.99 cheeseburger price. Rather than calling a manager over to remedy the situation she didn't know how to fix, she looked at us and said just click help on your app and they will give you a new $10 reward code to replace the one you lost today. On our first visit there were no napkins anywhere near our table. On subsequent visits we've been served the wrong food. Had to wait and ask twice on one occasion to get the food we ordered. One bad experience after another. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food good service clean.food fresh and done to  perfection. would gladly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this chain before, but I wanted some quick breakfast before leaving town and my Yelp app said this was close, cheap and tasty. I drove up and thought I might've made a mistake since it looks like a fast food joint. It became even more bizarre when I stepped inside and the interior decor looked like an old maid's farmhouse kitchen. The menu was full of typical breakfast foods, and they even claimed to make the eggs fresh. At any kind of fast food place, that's rare. I ordered a 3 egg breakfast with ham, tropical fruit & wheat toast.   I've gotta admit, it felt cozy when I sat down. The booths are like a breakfast nook, so it sort of reminded me of eating breakfast at my grandma's house. The food was good, not great. They weren't lying about the eggs - I could definitely tell they came from an actual egg, not some yellowy pouch of egg product stored in the freezer. The ham was decent - very salty, and one side had been griddled to death, leaving it with thick black marks. My tropical fruit was a mixed bag. The pineapple wasn't entirely ripe, neither was the honeydew, but the papaya was decent. My toast might've been good... if they hadn't globbed a huge smear of butter on it. Why would any place assume I want butter? Leave me a side of butter at the table. I'm a big boy, I can do it myself."}
{"text":"Nice thick meat? Yes.  We came here after Game Works, on a whim! Lol. The prices here are kind of steep, but if you go on day where they have a good special then it's not too bad.  I ended up getting a bacon burger, special was for 7.99 normally 10.99! My son also got a childs bacon burger. The food is made to order here, so you get a number and sit and wait. I forgot to mention the cashier, he was so nice and attentive and actually gave great suggestions!  We sat and waited about 5 minutes, checked out the decor and here came our food! Upon looking at it, it looked super delectable and savory! I asked for some ranch (of course) and the server was oh so kind to bring me 2 sides! The burgers were juicy and delicious! The ranch was legit delicious! None of that hidden valley ranch crap! The fries were also yummy and they give you enough!  Overall the experience was good. The only gripe is the pricing! And also, you get 3 onion rings for 2.19! WTH!! LOL. But, like I said, go on a day where their special is good and you'll be ok! I'm pretty sure Monday is the bacon burger day. Also, Yelp has a check in deal and if you sign up for the email club they send you a free burger!!!  Yay!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.. tried this place 4 times and 2 different location. Always slow and where ever I go,  I always ask for \"super well done crispy fries\". (Dont know how to be any clearer) comes out regular.  Burger taste like its been \"sandbaged\" (cooked ahead of time to help them serve faster) Just not my spot.. but the chicken club was very tasty.  The only place I've found close to Chick-fil-a ....fresh chicken sandwich. ."}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place. They have a lot of workers and everyone is asking how things are, but truthfully, it was a below average meal. I had breakfast, the California omelette with hash browns and the omellete was over cooked and the hash browns didn't have enough butter or oil in it. Hash browns were a bit grey looking. In addition, I had sourdough bread and the bread is paper thin. The plate/food was Luke warm. I paid $8.64 with tax and felt like I would of had a better breakfast at IHOP. Disappointed my Saturday morning was breakfast was wasted on this place. I've had their burgers and they are good, but will stay away for breakfast."}
{"text":"This was our first time to try this place and we all loved it. The prices were very good as was the food. I had the chili bowl with onions and a side of fries.  OMG!  SO GOOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast for dinner, the seating aria at 6:00 during dinner rush on Saturday was empty. Eggs were burned and toast was warm not toasted. Overall not impressed vs the other options next door. Will not return."}
{"text":"I definitely don't recommend the drive through. I waited for like 30 minutes for my food. When I got home my wife started to eat her chicken sandwich and she stopped. It turned out the chicken was not fully cooked and she had to throw it on a pan to cook it. For the wait and money it wasnt worth it. My wife still threw up after."}
{"text":"By far the best fast food experience. If you go there when the manager Santino Carbone is on the clock. He makes sure you have the best service.    I wpuld come here again before some restaurants. Food is great. And it's defintly freshly served."}
{"text":"Would be a 4 if it weren't for the ridiculous wait time. Don't hold your breath in the drive through. I've been here many times and I'm here right now. There's 3 cars in front of me and 2 behind me and we haven't moved in 20 minutes. This is NOT an exaggeration."}
{"text":"My drive through order is ALWAYS missing shit. ALWAYS.   Customer service is always great but this food is expensive to be jipping me."}
{"text":"In my opinion, it's hard to go wrong with any meal from Farmer Boys. I've been eating at this location off and on for the past eight years and yesterday's salad finally made me write a review. The salads are huge! I couldn't even finish it. I had the Chicken BBQ Ranch Salad and it was delicious. Farmer Boy salads are in a class of their own when it comes to fast food/ fast-casual salads. With summer amongst us, I will be stopping in to these more often and as with all fast food, make sure to drink your water because the sodium contents are insane!  Their burgers are very tasty too and the amount of food offerings including their breakfasts are   nearly unmatched, maybe only Jack-In-The-Box could come close but the quality difference is measurable."}
{"text":"Took the hubby here for Father's Day and he loved it!   Burgers were very good Service was friendly"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place finally since it opened up down the street from my home. Went to the drive thru.. it was really slow even with only two cars ahead of me. Ordered a Cobb salad, a farmhand bowl, plain cheeseburger for the kid and a 7pc zucchini. Total came out to $25.   Total bummer : restaurant claimed to not have a good source for avocados, so they just weren't serving anyway.   Cobb salad - portion was good, two little cups of dressing were barely enough for it. Oh and they didn't have any avocados, so that sucked.   Farmhand bowl - portion was small for the price. The other pictures people posted of the dine in farmhand bowl seemed to be more generous. The eggs were overly salty, I don't know what happened. We literally had to drown out the saltiness with ketchup (that they didn't even offer) to make it edible.   Fried zucchini - 7 piece portion, holy smokes the pieces are huge. It's lightly fried and not super oily, but the batter barely stuck to it and it has NO seasoning whatsoever. Virtually tasteless but a good value if this is what you want. Make sure to ask for some salt packets.   Cheeseburger - sesame seed bun, toasted and dry. The meat had a flame broiled / slightly smiley taste to it if that's what you're into.   I think it's great that this place tries/claims they use fresh local ingredients when they can, but don't tell me you can't find a good source for avocados. That's not a good excuse.  To make things worse, they packed my drive thru order on a counter that had spilled milk on it and it got all over my leather seat.  Would I eat here again? Sure, maybe when they get avocados I'll order the Cobb salad, fried zucchini with salt packets and extra napkins to line my seat with. This restaurant is a solid 3 star just like most of the other locations. Don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the great service and great fresh foods! The farmers chopped Cobb salad is my favorite and omg the ranch dressing is the way I love it!"}
{"text":"This Farmers Boys  location is the worst ever!! It made me change my opinion about this franchise. Bad service, cold food, servers with attitude to the max. I wasted $18.00 for nothing... I returned my breakfast back to the kitchen 3, yes three times!! I didn't eat at all!! Other Farmers Boys locations are much better than this one. Give yourself a favor and DON'T even think about coming over here!! Giving this place one  because there no Minus option."}
{"text":"Was feeling a burger today and I was tired of going to the same fast food joints. So I was recommended to try Farmers boys and I really enjoyed it.  Its fresh not to expensive and the employees were very professional. I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"First time I went, I ordered cheese burger and zucchini fries. It was really good and very big portions. Went last week and ordered the same burger. For what ever reason, the burger was dry, the meat way over cooked. The zucchini was just a tad under cooked. Different person cooking? Just not consistent. The restaurant itself is clean, love the roosters and country feel of the place. I'll go back again for another try, but for now, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is a great place. Everyone here is extremely friendly and the food is delicious!  A, 13 yrs   The kids love it and people go out of their way to make sure everything is ok. I can't believe my kid just asked for a to go box to take home the rest of his Zucchini! Fine dining type servers, Way to go Christofer and Montano!     Wish we had more room to eat, this place is a five star deserving place..... B, 10 yrs"}
{"text":"They have great sized breakfasts options here. The lady at the drive thru was very friendly. We asked a few questions regarding the menu options and we ending up getting something new on her recommendations. It was great! I wouldn't recommend this place if you're in a rush. We waiting awhile in the drive thru but the food was worth it!"}
{"text":"A great place to get a sit down meal, with great tasting ingredients, but at a faster speed. This is not \"fast food\".  I like that you can get breakfast all day, and you could order lunch or dinner entrees in the morning. Sometimes you need French toast for dinner, or a club sandwich for breakfast.   This location is located in SW Las Vegas. Whenever I'm in there it seems to be a mix of working guys on their lunch, and big groups of families. I'm not surprised,  since they have the \"kids eat free\" promotions on certain days.  I also like that Farmer Boys is committed to quality. Use the app, to get coupons & special deals, plus earning points toward food by scanning your receipts.  The staff is always super friendly, and do a great job of handling the busy times. Here's a bell ring  (clang,  clang!)."}
{"text":"I am by no means a fast food fan.  That being said, I really wish we had Farmer Boys down here in Phoenix area of Arizona!  On a recent trip back from Vegas, my wife and I decided to grab a quick inexpensive lunch off the strip before making our way back to AZ.  A quick search on Yelp took us here.  I went with one if the best tasting, freshest burgers I've had in a long long time!  The Barn Burner.  The beef tasted of higher quality, as did the jalapeÃ±o slices, lettuce, onion, and bun.  The fries too were perfectly crispy, just the way I like them.  The total for two burger combos came to under $20 too.  I've never known anyone happy to leave more money behind in Sin City, so this too had me walking away happy.  Overall, I will be hitting this place up again on my next trip to LV, but hope one day soon F.Bs open up closer to me in the 602!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever.... No salt or pepper... no seasoning... onion rings were so thick that not sure if it's one ring or whole onion.  Eggs were under cooked, fries had no salt or pepper, veggie patty was not cooked and was frozen... Grilled Cheese was so cold that  the cheese had harden again... the only thing I could drink was - Orange Juice.  Even coffee was so bad that I felt coffee flavoured hot water.... On top of that the app keeps crashing so can't add points... but don't worry about that anymore as won't be going there any more..."}
{"text":"Second time here and I am impressed with the food.  The pastrami sandwich is amazing.  Customer service is great too"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a handful of times The food is really good but they have lost my order twice to the point I have to go up to the counter 25 min after placing my order This has happened during my lunch break leaving me no time to eat  I won't be patronizing this place again"}
{"text":"I really like this place. First time i ate here, I had the jalepeno ranch burger (i think that's what it was called) with onion rings. Burger was great, but the onion rings were just ok. the batter they use has a weird thickness/ texture. Second time I ate here, I had the 3 eggs with bacon, hash browns and sour dough toast. This was pretty good for a \"fast food\" place. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger, but was too hungry for a sit down restaurant. That's when I remembered seeing Farmer Boys and thought I'd give it a try.  The menu is larger than a typical fast food restaurant. They have the usual burgers, fries, shakes, and salads. In addition, they have melts, sandwiches, and zucchini fries. I don't eat a lot of fast food so I'm not sure how their pricing compares to other fast food restaurants.  Employees were friendly and greeted us when we arrived. As the restaurant grew busier they added an additional cashier. Our wait for food was a few minutes so not too bad. The inside of the restaurant was clean enough that I'd actually consider eating there.   The Big Cheese Burger was okay, but the thousand island dressing and other toppings were the flavors that stood out more than the meat. It wasn't a very meaty burger. The zucchini fries and onion rings were okay, but I didn't care for the texture of the breading. The cookies and cream shake was really good. Overall, I'd liken the food to a McDonald's or a Burger more than a Fatburger or Habit Burger."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch but they ALWAYS forget something. Like get an avocado burger and there is no avocado... or bacon turkey melt and there is no bacon.... you have to always check what you get because something will be missing."}
{"text":"Best place to eat breakfast or lunch. I come here at least once a week and the food is always amazing. My favorite is the French toast. Staff are very polite and the manager is always attentive to the customers needs."}
{"text":"The French toast is good and has great flavor, the grilled cheese is spectacular, the service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The burgers are very good and reasonably priced.   The country yokel decor is a turnoff. I half expect to find haystraw in my meal.   Zucchini is very large - 1/4 of a whole one lengthwise is One stick.  Less oily or greasy than 5 guys."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go-to place.  Not anymore.  Went for the last time yesterday and ordered my usual, ChickenAvocadoBacon sandwich.  Took it back to work and it was awful.  The chicken was hardly larger than a silver dollar and fit on half the bun.  It was so rubbery and chewy that I threw it out and ate the bacon and avocado.  Of course I was on my lunch hour with no time to return to the restaurant.  And this wasn't the first bad sandwich I've purchased there, but I always like to give a place \"one bad day\".  Two in a row and I'm done."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible support. Didn't honor a coupon when they ran out bread bowls. Don't waste your time. Blame Rosie the manager.  This is why i stopped eating here. Crap food, poor management."}
{"text":"Excelente para desayunar, buenos precios, buenas porciones, lo Ãºnico malo es que esta muy retirado del strip"}
{"text":"So all my friends have been raving about this place and I decided to give it a try while waiting for my car. It was morning so I ordered the California omelette. It was nothing special and I've honestly had better breakfast at Denny's. Now I can't speak for their burgers because I have not had one, but this isn't where you want to go for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"After coming here a few more times, I had to change up my former (2 sentence) review. Lol  Being a fast food chain, I'll make this a fast review.  Farmer Boys is pretty much a high end Carl's Jr. Food freshly made and served straight to your table by number so no standing around waiting and what not. Always fully staffed to ensure food is made fresh and steadfast. Prices are a bit higher than CJ's but personally think its only because of the fact there's only so many FB's in the city.  If you're a fan of Zucchini fries, the ones here will not disappoint you. Even though frying them defeats the concept of being healthy Lol. I guess I can say the same thing about their Chicken Barbecue Ranch Salad. Burger boys come hungry, these suckers are cooked to perfection. Believe it or not, only real men know the taste of real burgers. Something to look forward to is the manager actually coming around from the back and helping out with wiping down tables and ensuring meals met customers requirement.  Quality of freshness has yet failed to impress me. I'm just missing out on trying their breakfast menu out... cool Thunderbird painting on ceiling though;)"}
{"text":"Second try at Farmer Boys....  In my original review I said I would not go back, but Farmer Boys lured me in. Mostly because it is so close to where I work and when I get off work I have limited options as to where I can eat. Typically I try not to eat out during my work week, but this past week I was being lazy because I had had a head cold. So - cheeseburger to the rescue!  This time I went with the \"Natural Burger\", which I honestly enjoyed much more than their regular cheeseburger. The cheese was really melted into the patty, which was nice. But there were a lot of onions on the burger I ended up picking off. Next time I'll just say no onions.   Instead of fries I ordered onion rings, but ummm I really, really did not like these rings. They were just really not the style I like. The breading was falling off before I got home (because I'll be honest I DID eat one while driving down the road). The batter is very thin and the rings are very big and chunky. I think this is really just a preference thing - but the onion rings here were not for me.  New overall opinion - A-OK. Would I go back? Yes. Would I order the onion rings? No. Maybe I'll just stick strictly with the burgers and try the breakfasts some time."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger \"Khalil Henderson\" heard wrong and when the wrong burger came out I ask to change the burger to the one I ordered. He instead told me that maybe I should order like a man instead of have her order.  The shift manager intervened on his side, asking me what I wanted while he talked sht in the back . While my burger was being made he said \" let's go outside dawg shiet you ain't even be alive\" exactly like how you think they would say it. Funny cause if he woulda done that , he'd be in a body bag forreal \"dawg\""}
{"text":"First and last time. Go somewhere else. It's not very good, overpriced, and they took forever to make the food. What a headache. We have no desired to go back.   The fries were soggy, not crisp. The burger was poorly made, bland, and the bacon burger didn't have much bacon. The combos are over priced. You get this small cup and small fry, it's sad."}
{"text":"Definitely the priciest fast food I've ever had in my life. Let's start with that.   I'll follow it up with the manager today was impressively friendly and professional, however the two girls who worked by his side had little crab attitudes (crabitudes). One was new and likely overwhelmed so I give her a pass.   The food takes longer than most fast food places, but rightfully in my opinion. It's fresher stuff and the quality is tasted. So I can definitely put up with that knowing the reason why. They did forget to deliver my shake I ordered today though and gave me that earlier stated \"crabitude\" once I asked for it 5 minutes into eating my food as if I was lying to them to get a free item. It was a shake that was visibly printed on my $22 receipt if you cared to take a look instead of profiling, lady... chill.   Other than that... darn good food at nearly \"budget restaurant\" prices (think Applebee's)."}
{"text":"The drive thru wait time was excessive and the food was cold.  8.50 for a sandwich that was mediocre at best.  The pastrami was dry and parts of it had a crust from being under a heat lamp or something.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed the Farmer Boys from California. Never disappointing. Great burgers. Nice decor inside."}
{"text":"Ok... Don't get me wrong. I love their food and I go to this location about once a month. I used the drive thru and I waited 20mins... In a drive thru! I felt bad for the 2 more cars behind me. They were probably there for an hour. And as I ate my club sandwich, there was a hair on the lettuce of my sandwich. I wasn't trying to go back and wait 20 more mins just to go and complain. I recommend their food but maybe try a different location. If you need to come here, watch out  for hair in your food and be ok to wait"}
{"text":"Saw this place driving and wanted a drive thru breakfast other than McDonald's or Jack in the Box. Drive thru was awesome, it was fast and the breakfast food was made fresh. French toast with bacon and eggs is what I recommend!"}
{"text":"If it's your first time coming here don't go through the drive thru....there is too many choices! I unfortunately went through the drive thru because I was on a time crunch...and I made a snap decision. My husband and I ordered the Farmer's Burger it is a huge burger it's almost the size of what you would see at an Islands. It had bacon and avocado... it  was good but I think the taste of avocado and the bacon masked the taste of the burger as a whole. We shared the fries which was a pretty big helping. I almost got full off of the fries alone. These fries are not the puny fries you would find at a Burger King they are thicker. I wish I ordered a salad or a chicken sandwich because I felt like I was feeling burnt out on burgers ...next time I will take some time and go in so I can have a little more time to look over the menu."}
{"text":"I stopped here late morning on Sunday. I have driven by many times and was curious. I was in the mood for breakfast and decided to give them a try. There was a good line but they moved it fairly quickly and it gave we time to figure out how this place worked. You order at the counter and are given a number if you are dining in. A server will then locate you. I ordered the Farmer Boy Breakfast bowl. It was very good. I do think it is heavy on the amount of hash browns given versus meat , egg etc. I will stop in again probably not on a Sunday and will try something else. Casual dining with a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times before and we're happy both times.  It's a bit on the noisy side so if quite is what you're looking for, it may not be a place for you!  It is good food though!!!  Parking can be a ways out of you have a larger car or truck"}
{"text":"I was getting my car washed across the street and saw Farmer Boys.... Had to try it out, right? Burgers were what looked like the start for us..... I had the Original with Fries, my husband had thew Big Cheese with Onion Rings. My burger was GREAT!!!  For me, this is exactly how I like a burger fresh meat, pattied by hand. Super soft fresh bun and just sauce, onion and pickle. I can taste the meat without it being so meat filled that I am eating the whole cow! (not a fan of two and three patties) The fries were good, but the homemade onion rings were crazy!! Thick pieces of fresh cut onion..... I mean thick!! Battered and Fried Fresh.... Yay!!! I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast menu, they use hash browns not chunks of potatoes..... HASH BROWNS in their breakfast burritos and breakfast bowls!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and it's still just ok. Folks I work with like to frequesnt this place, but I am just not as enthusiastic as they are.  Grilled cheese is pretty good, but I'll be darned if I am \"going out to eat\" just to have grilled cheese!  Call me crazy!"}
{"text":"Second time in a row our order has been wrong. The first time one of us got a Chicken BBQ Ranch wrap. Asked for no tomatoes no bacon. Got it back to the office, there was only lettuce (not even fresh looking) and ranch (I don't even know if I could call it that..) in the wrap. Not what was ordered.  Decided to give this location a second try today. Same meal, same no tomatoes, no bacon. I don't eat red meat or pork. This time there was double tomatoes and bacon in it. I decided to just deal with it and eat it. I took one bite and had to spit it out. The bacon was so hard that it hurt my tooth. An hour later, my tooth is still in pain. I called back and they told me my next meal would be free. Too bad I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, as my first visit I was in love. Next two trips were huge disappointments. If you're eating inside and can go back to the counter and get your food made correctly, give this place a shot. If you're like me and use the drive thru, keep driving. Nothing worse than getting home w $9 sandwiches and finding they're made wrong and you can't eat them, twice."}
{"text":"My upset stomach is so real right now.  Why y'all do me like that?!  Anyways, I went with my friend today since she wanted breakfast and I wanted lunch. I order my burger, and we sit down and chop it up.   So she gets her food, and the people who ordered after us did as well. I'm like maybe mines is taking longer because it's a burger, but my friend insisted she would wait for my food before she ate.   Yeah, so I just told my friend to eat and I would go up and ask. I did and I look over at the heater lamp and my food was the only plate sitting there, but management kept asking the back what's with the burger. So they gave it to me as is, no sorrys or let's make another order. Still, I'm super chill about the whole ordeal, because I understood even though I didn't have to understand and decide to get rightfully upset.   Girl, my fries were so cold. But I made my friend wait, so I had no other choice but to eat something... well I did have a choice, but y'all know what I mean. Management does not come up to me and make a round to see how every thing was, girl, I was over it. They probably didn't want to hear it, can't blame them... lemme stop."}
{"text":"I placed my order to go and after almost 20 minutes and watching others who came in after me receive their food, I went and asked what happened to my order???  I was told they accidentally gave my order to someone in the drive thru and they were redoing my order.  Don't tell me about this mixup just let me sit and wait, nice.  The manager did offer me a $5 voucher for next time for the wait.  I got my order and headed to my truck.  Once in the truck I opened the bag and the free cookie that was supposed to come with my order and was the FIRST item on the ticket was nowhere to be found.  I went back inside and told the girl who rolled her eyes, not at me but at the mixups and disorganization that seemed to haunting this place today.  She gave me my cookie with a smile, apologized and wished me a god day.  Even the manager seemed flustered today.  The food was good and being the first thing I ate today I was happy for the burger and fries.  I am not sure if my stomach liked it as much as I headed straight to the bathroom when I finished eating it, but my brain was happy.  This is only the second time I've eaten here, I am not sure if there will be a third time.   The $5 off voucher he gave me I am sure will be passed to someone else as I probably will not be giving this place another shot."}
{"text":"I was craving a grilled chicken sandwich and made a nice little stop here to fill my belly while on my lunch break. I love the fact that they have a drive thru so it's a quick and easy in and out situation.   I ended up getting the charbroiled chicken sandwich along with a side salad. The sandwich was very tasty and under 500 calories which was nice. It came on a soft wheat bun with lettuce, tomato and mayo as toppings. The salad I actually ended up saving for later since I was quite full enough from the sandwich, but it looked very fresh and delicious.  The pricing was a bit expensive, around $10 for the combo, but the portion was very generous. The service was also quick and friendly too. I'd definitely return again to this location."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the location. This is a very new location and it takes forever to order and forever to get your food. I waited 10 minutes to order, and over 20 minutes to get my food. Granted this is suppose to be fresh fast food but I ordered a salad and my son ordered a kids burger. There was a lady who was downloading the app so she could save $5 holding up the line! This place was also dirty and left unattended."}
{"text":"Waiting 15 minutes for a \"cooked to order\" burger is worth it, in my opinion.  When they delivered a burger with cheese slices that looked like they came out of the refrigerator, I was a little surprised.  Upon investigation, I found the patties on my double burger to be less than room temperature with congealed grease stuck to the bottom.  Then I waited an additional 10 minutes for a refund.  Now it's 1pm and time to get back to work.  Absolute fail.  If I wanted a cold burger, I'd go to Burger King.  I'm pissed."}
{"text":"The drive through is used for convenience, correct? The problem with Farmer Boys is not their food. It's the fact that every single time I come here, I sit in the drive through longer than I should. In fact, I'm here now and have been for the last 10 minutes and I still have 2 cars ahead of me!! WTF!!"}
{"text":"It's only ok. The food wasn't anything to write home about. The Farmers burger lacked anything resembling taste and to be honest I wasn't thrilled with how it felt in my hand. It was very stiff and reminded me of a day old AM/PM burger... you know a coaster between to rock hard buns.   My wife had the breakfast burrito and all she could say was... We should have gone to Jack in the Box... I don't think I need to say anything more.   The employees were really friendly and fixed my wife's bacon burrito when it showed up at the table with no bacon.   I would say try this place and maybe you can find what you are looking for. For me it's too far away to justify mediocre food when In N Out and Freddie's are just across the street."}
{"text":"Really good. Beautiful onion rings.  Clean. Clean bathrooms. Good service. I want to buy stock in the company."}
{"text":"I am not going to spend too much time on this review because it was just an average burger. It actually was pretty damn close to a whopper from Burger King. It was a good fast food burger, but it was not worth the drive from Summerlin."}
{"text":"For the love of God do NOT go in their drive thru!! I literally sat in line tonight for 45 minutes!! 45 MINUTES!! Made a last minute decision to get food after an extremely long day at work before getting on the freeway and mannnn I regret it lol. When the car in front of me got to the window, they gave them a discount for waiting so long... but when I FINALLY got to the window they didn't offer me a discount.  I find that extremely rude considering I waited just as long as they did! The only thing that made me decide to give an extra star is that my food was pretty good. Don't think ill ever go back here though. I have never waited even half that time in a drive thru and from reading the reviews, it seems like it happens all the time!"}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and the onion rings are the best i've ever tasted. The farmer burger with avocado and bacon is huge! Its kind of a bad thing since its down the street from my job and i drive past it everyday. The breakfast burrito's are delicious never had breakfast but I will try it soon."}
{"text":"UPDATE: after waiting for OVER A MONTH for a phone call back from the area manager, i STILL didn't hear anything. I called corporate and she was surprised but she never heard anything from the area manager either. Farmer Boys reaches out to me via Yelp but once I responded, i still didn't hear anything. Corporate was helpful but nothing was done of this issue. Terrible customer service.   I came here today and ordered a California chicken club combo and a bbq chicken ranch salad. After waiting for 15 minutes I went up to the counter just to ask how much longer my order was going to be. The supervisor checked my receipt, went to the back to talk to the cooks, and then comes back to me and says the the club sandwich takes longer because they have to fry the chicken. FYI, the chicken on my salad is also fried but she never mentioned that at all.  As she was saying that though, I hear the chicken bring dropped in to the fryer so it makes me wonder if my order was skipped over or forgotten. After 20 minutes, I finally got my order but no apology from anyone for the long wait. Once I finally got home, my order was completely wrong and the fries were cold and ended up being trashed. Makes me really resent this place now"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Las Vegas, Farmer Boys served real beef and the hamburgers were fat and juicy. Now, you get this flat nasty burger that tastes like cloth. I don't eat there anymore. There vegtables are better than there burgers now."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Farmer Boys for about 7 years, and I try to stop by for a meal every time I'm in Vegas (since I don't have one locally). I am always impressed by their excellent service. You order your meal at the counter, and they bring it out to your table. Even though drinks are self-serve, the servers will come by and check on you, and will refill your drinks. I love their melt sandwiches, soup, and fried zucchini. I tricked myself into thinking that Farmer Boys was super healthy, but now that they have calorie measurements on their menu, I know that the food is hearty (not exactly healthy). But given it's a fast-food joint, there are a lot of worse places you can eat. Watch for daily specials to get a good deal."}
{"text":"Got the veggie burger and was pleased with it until I pulled out a long black hair. I'm blonde so it was definitely not mine. Disgusting! Wear hair nets! Instantly made me want to vomit!"}
{"text":"2nd attempt at Farmer Boys at the Charleston location in Las Vegas....bad decision.  My first experience was with their Fish Platter and it was the grossest thing I ever tasted!!!   The fish was greasy and the fries where soggy. No flavor at all.  I fail to mention they were only open a week.  So I decided to give them a second chance to see if things have been stream lined and if there were any improvements .  No.  I only order a salad people...A southwest Chicken Salad!!! Probably prepackaged and chicken added at the point of sale.  The lettuce was wilted and had brown edges.  Saw dust chicken cut squares with italian dressing and a drink.  A wasted $10.90."}
{"text":"I've worked near here a few times over the last couple of years. I'm happy to say I've built up a rapport with a lot of the cashiers and they seem to remember my usual orders pretty well. Just wish the food wasn't so highly priced for what really is fast food."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. It was huge! My medium onion rings only had 4 in it because they were bigger than my fist. I can eat a lot and I'm so freaking full. 2 people can share the avocado burger and onion rings and still be full. I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. I think I'm addicted! It takes a little longer to get your food but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Good fresh food. The hamburgers looked amazing, but I decided to get the southwest salad instead.  It was huge...like the size of my face.  I am a bit of a lettuce snob, not that I have to have certain types, but that I can't stand even the slightest bit of brown, limp, or ribby pieces of lettuce so I don't normally get salads at restaurants.  This one was great.  The lettuce was all fresh and crisp and it seemed like every bite had chicken or avocado in it as well.  The salad also came with a chili ranch dressing.  The lady said several times that if we didn't like the chili ranch she would bring us something else, so I don't know if they get a lot of negative feedback on it, but both me and the other guy at the table that ordered it agreed that it was great and really complemented the salad.  High quality fast food, we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I will never go there again. I went there for the first time yesterday evening and ordered \"The Natural.\" I got home opened it and the bun was twice the size if the \"natural\" burger. Not only was it small and insignificant, but dryer than piece of cardboard. Anyways the reason I really wrote this review is because this morning I also woke up with severe stomach pain and diarrhea. Not fun while I get ready for work. Carls Jr has more high quality burgers."}
{"text":"Traditional America breakfast.    Share 1 main course and order 2 drinks with my bff, that's why it is less than 14 bucks for 2 pax. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"On this wet and wild Las Vegas Saturday morning to delay the pouring rain and wild driving environment I waited for the rain to calm down with a Farmer Boys breakfast. This would be my follow up visit at this location in the shadow of the Eastern McCarren Marketplace Walmart.      As soon as I stepped inside, my mind was transplanted from Las Vegas to a barnyard. The farmyard theme permeates the lobby creating an interesting visit. The lobby is decorated with rooster statues, pictures, and other interesting barnyard memorbelia. At Farmer Boys, the barnyard theme is a good thing because the wait from order to table is approximately ten minutes. The restaurant boasts that upon the time of the customer ordering they make the food.      Regardless that Farmer Boys makes the food fresh and allegedly use the freshest ingredients; the format is fast food. Just like in Carl's Jr., the customer peruses a menu above the counter and orders. After paying, the employee hands you a number to bring to the table. Disparate from a handful of fast food chains, Farmer Boys features an expansive selection of all day breakfast and lunch/dinner items. I would get a taste out of both.       On my leading visit, I ordered the Big Cheese with fries and a beverage. In my opinion this was an ordinary burger that did not stand out from the competition of casual fast food restaurants. However, my opinion differs from several foodies in the Inland Empire. The My Fox LA Hot List Inland Empire voted Farmer Boys the best burger in the Inland Empire.      As I began the review, early this morning I went here for breakfast. Using the barnyard apology, the prices are nothing to cock-a-doodle-doo about. The rooster and barnyard theme absorbs the blow of the high prices. Take the breakfast I ordered. The three egg breakfast combo costs around $8.79. That is before you add a beverage. I cannot enjoy breakfast with a beverage. The small coffee added to the combo added up to close to $12. Another comparison is the BLT combo was around $10.75. That is astronomical for a restaurant with a fast food format. If it was not downpouring, it is guaranteed that I would have waved goodbye to the roosters and made a path to a full service breakfast eatery such as Egg Works, Has Houses, IHOP,  or anywhere.       This three egg breakfast also included ham, hash browns, and English Muffins. The ham stole the spot light over the three scrambled eggs. This was a decent size juicy ham. It is a good thing that I ordered this over the bacon or sausage. The shift manager who took my order delivered my breakfast and cup of coffee to the table. I appreciate that she would volunteer to refill my mug (not disposable) of coffee  and mentioned that she'd give me a to go coffee cup. For the record this was good coffee.      It appears that management might of read Gregg W's review. On my two visits they played oldies in lieu of country. Oldies and a barnyard theme create an upbeat atmosphere.     In conclusion I am not in a hurry to return here. Management needs to do something about the high prices. A possible and realistic solution is to include coffee with the breakfast combinations. In similar style to my three star reviews there is a return factor. During my public check-in, my Yelp friend Travis asked me if I tried their breakfast burrito. It is possible that I would return here for a breakfast burrito made with fresh ingredients or to try their large onion rings. What is certain that, I Daniel. S rate the Eastern McCarren Marketplace Farmer Boys Three Stars."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  Maybe a little pricey, but overall if I'm in the neighborhood I will partake."}
{"text":"First time coming in here and the place looks nice and the people are friendly. The menu looks pretty good but I can't comment on my food quiet yet. The place is nice and very clean but it's also really cold while we wait for our food. We got a $5 off coupon for signing up for their rewards program.  The food came out pretty quickly.  My turkey melt was pretty good alittle bit soggy on the bottom and pretty salty tasting but good. The salt came from the bacon and was really strong.  The chicken club was okay nothing special more bread than chicken. The onion rings that we got with it were pretty disappointing not really that good or crispy either. The summer breakfast we got for our 6 year old was the best thing though the pancakes were fresh made and so was the fruit.  Overall the place is nice and friendly but the food isn't really good. Carl's jr or jack in the box has better items at a similiar price.  We will give it another chance and stick to the breakfast menu next time but won't be back for lunch."}
{"text":"I have never had a Bad experience here. I come here for lunch quite often to meet people from the base. I'm a picky person and they have never messed up my order. Everything comes out in a timely manner and all at once. The manager is always walking around making sure everybody is satisfied and happy with their meal. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time I came here they messed up my burger and both of my kids burgers. I decided to give them a try again!! After waiting 10 minutes in the drive-through I received a burger with eggs lol..I went into the store to tell them I had checked since they messed my order up badly last time and received the wrong burger.. They gave me a burger which had onions and pickles which, I ordered with out!!!!! It was also missing the avocado!! Another 10 min wait while the probably scraped stuff off I didn't want I received my burger again missing the avocado. These people are incompetent and I will never go there again!! The dude at the register made these ladies wait 10 min. Before ordering cause he couldn't figure out why nothing was working since he put the paper in wrong lmfao!! The poor little girl who was helping me was obviously overwhelmed because she was doing the drive-through, answering phones and doing the other incompetent person's job! If you want to spend over $10 for one combo that no one can ever get right and takes 20 min.to even receive your food GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Every visit I'm truly satisfied. I come hungry but leave happy because the food is hot and fresh. The server Roxanne greets me every single time with a smile and is happy to help me with the menu. She is always working hard and going out of her way to make sure her guests are happy. Way to go Rox!"}
{"text":"We were trying to find a place off the strip that wouldn't take all day.. This place is awesome, there were 9 of us, we all ordered different things and everyone loved their food.. Good price, not so fast food with fast service"}
{"text":"SÃºper clean and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food was great too! Compared to the CA locations this by far exceeds in everything. They also have better deals."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for over 5 years now and I finally stepped foot into a Farmer Boys location. I was kind of surprised by all of the different things they offer. While their burgers looked good and smelled even better, I'm trying to watch what I eat and I thought I'd compromise with a Southwestern Salad...  This wasn't a compromise. This was not a salad with tons of iceberg lettuce and a few things tossed on the top to make it look good. This thing was loaded with good stuff all the way through, and it was good from start to finish. Most importantly I wasn't starving again 2 hours after eating it.  I'm also a fan of their fresh squeezed orange juice. I tried it on a whim and OMG is it good. I'd go back for the Orange Juice alone, but my first experience overall was good enough that I plan on going back again. I even bothered to download their app and if you scan your receipt you get $5 off your next purchase. Trust me, I'll be putting that $5 off to good use shortly.   4 Stars. I can't wait to go back and try more of their stuff."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff!! Clean and sleek restaurant. Also, I love that they lettuce wrap their cheese burgers, which taste amazing. The chicken Cobb salad was also delicious! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Came here starving and ordered a farmer's burger combo, bacon boy combo and a bell ringer combo. Let me start by telling you that everything was close to being as cold as a tomatoe out of the fridge! The fries were soggy cold and the bacon on the burgers was chewy to almost being raw. Do not go and waste your money at this place. We had to put everything in the oven to heat it up and had to cook the bacon. Flavorless paper thin burger patties. Will never eat at this dump again!"}
{"text":"Ok well maybe there breakfast is better, but not to many places make fried zucchini and I love fried zucchini, it was very bland! They messed up my order and instead of fixing my order charged me for it!! Really guys!!!! and I sat in the drive thur for 12 minuets with only one car in front of me ! Need to do better then this to get me to came back here!"}
{"text":"Burnt toast was served after a 20 min wait with only 2 other customers. Also have to wait another 20 mins for the milkshake, we have to show our receipt and remind them we ordered it. So we are not coming back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"not much of a fasfood eater, but Farmer Boys is one of the few I'll patronize. However, can corporate provide some training for your drive-thru procedures??? The wait is always consistently feeble at best. Your people are clueless when it comes to drive-thru operation. This has nothing to do with your food quality and offerings"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and fresh here.  This was my first visit to this location and it is now my favorite in town.  I was greeted by Marissa and she is the most friendly person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I got a 3 egg breakfast and it was cooked to perfection.  Thanks for everything.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Love this place and location. The food is almost always excellent, but a few times it's been lacking. However, today we had extremely good service at this location. The gentleman that took our order and handled everything was fantastic and very courteous. The food was on point, and this visit was refreshing.  With so many other restaurants around town lacking in basic customer service skills, I'm glad we chose to go here tonight."}
{"text":"Decent food at decent prices makes for a good value here. It was a good breakfast. Everyone was very friendly and pleasant. The pace was clean and in decent shape. It was a good choice for breakfast. There was a little bit of a glitch when our food was bought out but that was fixed quickly and we enjoyed our breakfast."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Farmer Boys after I had driven past several times AND noticed the very cost-efficient Yelp deal for a cheeseburger combo. Note to future diners: For a limited time, the cheeseburger combo ($5.49 with Yelp check in) also comes with some delicious cinnamon bites, but you have to ask for them otherwise they will not serve them to you automatically (even though there's signs about the deal everywhere).   The employee who took our order was VERY confused by the Yelp deal, and it took her a couple extra minutes to punch it in, but no biggie! It also took 10 minutes for our order to be prepared, but when it was ready, it was fresh and delicious! I highly recommend the cheeseburger as well as the cinnamon bites.   The only reason this review is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is the somewhat slow service and coupon confusion, but I bet the next time I go here, I'll have to update this review to 5."}
{"text":"Not impressed...ordered three egg breakfast and eggs toast were fine however I got fruit as a side instead of hash brown and about half of it was not fresh and I couldn't eat it.  Additionally there was a homeless man sitting outside the entrance not leaving a good first impression.  Never going back."}
{"text":"We were not impressed.  The burgers are not terrible but they are not great either. Definitely very average as were the fries. Carl's Jr down the street makes a better burger and fries if you are in the area and hungry for a burger."}
{"text":"Good food ppl are nice night shift Kool morning crew good to price is good depending on what u get that OJ is a bit high even tho u don't get a glove lol but other then that I kome all the time in tell they mess up"}
{"text":"I went to FB for just the second time today. It was raining (I know, what a treat for us, right? It was this mysterious thing falling from the sky that lasted for *gasp* over 4 hours off and on). and so we pulled in after sloshing around the valley for fun. We ordered the same thing, the pastrami and an extra round of zucchinis. The bill came out to be $16. Not exactly a great price but it was not bad. The food is tasty and the zucchinis are piping hot. They do not season the zucchini, it's battered and deep fried. But, I like my zucchinis plain usually, maybe grilled for a little more flavor. Overall, it's more healthy grilled, steamed, or stir fried.  I have to tell you, those zucchinis are Albertson's size and cut into quarters. So, if you are expecting fast food bites, think again. You can whack somebody with one of this and it would probably be felt. Albeit, it'd be a healthy whack both in food and force. The place is always clean and the employees greet you with a smile. So, overall, the staff and food gives this place a 4 star."}
{"text":"Never had it and finally got the chance to try it. It was to die for! And they have this cool plan if you add their app you get continuous food discounts and specials. Just scan your receipt, really cool.  So let's talk food. You get more than enough and oh boy so yummy. I ordered the Bacon Boy combo and substituted fries for their Chili Cheese with Onion. One word: DELICIOUS  They have a huge menu to choose from so you can't go wrong. Can't wait to go back and try breakfast as I have heard nothing but good things."}
{"text":"I'd have to say the food is just \"average\" here. I tried the fish and chips since they looked so good on the menu. The fish was 'ok', nothing special. The breading was bland, no real seasonings or anything special. The onion rings were not good at all. The onion was still crunchy, probably undercooked since they were pretty large. The service was very good here though, prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Well here's the deal, I have been going to Farmer Boys going 15 to 20 years. To say this really disappoints me. I am not satisfied by the turn around in the quality of the food.  You know when you go out of your way to visit a place (one of my favorites I might add), and the food is a disappointment, it bugs me.  My favorite items to order are the Onion Rings and the Fried Zucchini. Some may know that I spent over 20 years in the food industry, so I know a lot of the little tricks they use to save money. When you try to maintain your food costs, over keeping up your food standards then it may be time to rethink things about this Farmer boys. The onion rings were dropped back in the fryer to cook a second time, how can you tell well, the color is not the light golden brown you expect when you pull it out of the fryer. My wifes rings were dark brown, extremely hard for her to eat. My zucchini was not up to parr either they were not the crisp planks of sections of a whole zucchini we are used to. Like they had been sitting under the heat lamp or a bit.  Now the best thing about having the above two mentioned itwms waas thwir ranch dressing, nice and thick and creamy. Not this time... saving money costs to make the ranch go farther, dilute it with milk, make it runny so it doesn't stick to the food and you get more out of it.  Gonna go to our old one on the south end of town to see if they maintained their standards. If not Adios Farmer Boys.  Service and cleanliness remain high in ranking that's why the 2 stars. Totally Bummed Out Consumer."}
{"text":"I am thrilled that Vegas has a Farmer Boy's!  This is excellent food, prices are relatively reasonable, and the staff is friendly.  Good, quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered two Daybreak sandwiches - one with sausage, one with bacon. In both cases, pictures speak louder than words (see pics). Wish I could say they tasted better than they look, but that would be lying and momma taught me better. Greasy, soggy, buns missing pieces, and odd taste to the eggs. Couldn't take more than one bite - ended up tossing. If this is their interpretation of farm-to-table, best they keep it at the farm."}
{"text":"I love farmer boys when I want food fast breakfast food! I've tried the soup, French toast, breakfast bowls, and burgers! (Not all in one sitting lol) They were all really good. The bacon burger I had is out of this world if you're a bacon lover! I also had the cookies and cream shake. If you're into sweets it was good. But I had to drink water after drinking the shake because it was sweeter then I can handle."}
{"text":"The best Double Bacon Burger in town with a drive-thru! This is a burger worth your appetite and your time!"}
{"text":"Incredible! After a long wait at the drive thru we get home and we got the order of 2 cars behind us! Then when brought to management's attention they could care less and never once apologized for THEIR mistake. Will never return. Cannot recommend farmer boys to anyone.  UPDATE! See below! Copy and paste corporate message. Doesn't even come close to the reason the one star review was given. Sad and embarrassing. Reflects how they see the customer. SAD!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why they have so little stars! I love this place! We always get our zuchinni sliced smaller so they are cooked more. Their meat is delicious and juicy...and best strawberry shake in town! Always friendly staff at this location and kept clean. Comparable to In N Out."}
{"text":"We came from the Base and was hungry for brunch, ran into this spot. We were skeptical because it had a drive thru.  This place is suppose to use all natural ingredients. We wanted breakfast, but when I seen how thin the bacon was, I opted out for their burgers since they said they were award winning. Well, what credited award was it? Because the burger I had was mediocre. It had no flavor and didn't taste the freshness of the beef.   The staff was very nice and explained to us about the franchise and that's why this place gets a 3 Star. One person with us didn't even finish her breakfast burrito. Didn't even bother to take the other half home. The salads looked good. But, it seems like the entire farmers story is a facade by using \"natural\" as a campaign."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss, the food is ok its not \"Fantastic\" so it good if you are planning to just grab something. For some reason the oranges they place on our plates always look lile they have been bitten into. The staff is very friendly and the place is really clean. I am glad they are here and will come back (just wont eat the oranges)"}
{"text":"I only come here for the fried zucchini. It's well worth your money I've been to other places buying fried zucchini but nothing ever compares to theirs. They also come out fresh. What's cool them is they don't charge extra for ranch but it took us asking more then 3 times to different people for extra ranch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time ever because we heard about their free Farmer's Burger from 2 to 5 pm. Not only was that an amazing deal considering it's a $7 burger, it was also delicious! I got a breakfast sandwich (they definitely won me over with their all day breakfast menu!) and onion rings - the onion rings are HUGE and some of the best I've ever had, plus they're some of the cheapest I've seen anywhere! Honestly, I see a few bad reviews on here, but for never having been there before, we were very impressed and plan on coming back. They were very busy when we went in due to the free burger offer yet the staff was all still so friendly and patient and even the owners were being personable and saying hello to everyone who came in. Everything on the burger tasted fresh and of great quality. I would definitely recommend this place if you've never tried it!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at a Farmer Boys restaurant. I walked in and was greeted by a wonderful smell of delicious food being prepared. There was no line at the time so I walked right up and ordered. The cashier was very friendly and patient as I stared at the menu without an inkling of what I was going to order. Finally I settled on the all natural cheeseburger with guacamole as bacon. I made it a combo and to complete my fat kid desire, I upgraded my fries to chili cheese fries (no judging it was cheat day and cold outside!) before I knew it my food came. Hot, fresh and tasty! It was like eating a home cooked meal. I will definitely be going back and I'll do my best at trying something new but that burger is going to be hard to beat for quite some time."}
{"text":"After being advised NOT to go to Farmer Boys, I decided to visit. As I entered, it appeared I had walked into a Cracker Barrel-esque restaurant complete with curtains, ceiling fans and light fixtures. I ordered the \"natural\" burger which comes on a nice bun with cheese, bacon, chopped onions, \"secret sauce\", which is a Russian Dressing concoction and guacamole. Now, on TV, this looked good and I would assume it hopefully would taste good. The result? Absolutely tasteless. Kudos to the friendly staff, not the burger. I should have listened to my friend."}
{"text":"Man, I really had high hopes for this place. I wanted to get something SUPER TASTY but I ended up leaving thinking I just ordered a Western  Bacon from Carl's Jr. I don't know what it was about this visit, but my burger patty tasted so similar to that of Carl's Jr. I literally thought it was from the same supplier or something.   I have had Farmer Boys back in Anaheim, CA and the food was always delicious. Mind you, every previous visit was for breakfast so maybe that is just the best time of day to check them out. I can say, the breakfast is amazing! It is a step above Denny's/IHOP but nothing too fancy that you are too fearful to bring the whole family.   I would definitely try it again, but not anytime soon. I wasn't too impressed with having to wait 25 minutes (I had to change from dine in to carry out because it just took way too long), and the tasteless meat patty. If I'm in the area, and REALLY hungry I will probably be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cod Fillets, very greasy and soaked in oil. Could not eat this and won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"First time was a treat! Service was fast and great. Price was reasonable and breakfast was fantastic can't wait to try their burgers next!"}
{"text":"For fast food, the food is really good, service is solid. I've only had positive experiences here. My expectations aren't too high,  again,  it's fast food. Most importantly, the kids love it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Always clean, and they usually have 20% off coupons on yelp. The burgers are juicy and delicious, vegetables fresh and crisp.   Sandwiches are a great option if your not wanting a hot plate. I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Salty and cold ! What a disappointment the hamburger literally tasted days old. The meat was so salty and dry and they don't even use mustard or ketchup ? The fries were soggy. I did a half n half with the zucchini that was a mistake 1 piece is 1/2 of a zucchini fried ? Ok I'm not trying to eat a whole zucchini with my food. For over 10 bucks and a 15min wait no way hell I wouldn't pay 5$. Stay clear better options out there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried this place since we heard it was good. We went and saw they had a lunch and a breakfast menu. I was going to get lunch, it was going on noon, but last min decided on the 3 egg breakfast. It came with choice of bacon or sausage patties and hash browns with choice of toast. Hubby got a double cheeseburger of some kind with guacamole, and a side of chili cheese fries. You could get reg fries or zucchini fries as well:) We ate inside and it took about 7 min to get our order. The food was very good. And filling! They have a soda fountain so you can get refills yourself:) And the guy who helped us was super nice! He told us to ring the bell on our way out if we enjoyed our meal, and we did! Our 3 yr old rang it! I'm sure we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm up in the air here. I really enjoy their burgers and my son loves the fish dinner. You cannot complain about the wait, if you want to get a bag as soon as you order go to McDonald's. If you're going to complain about the drive through there is ample parking and you can wait inside and save your gas, you knew when ordering it was going to by 10 minutes.  The downside is breakfast. I didn't think the burrito was anything spectacular and on this occasion I was right there so I grabbed a breakfast bowl which didn't seem to work well as a dish.  So I would give them 3 for breakfast. Servers are always pleasant and tolerant to me asking stupid questions.  They have a reward program as well. Download the app for $5 off"}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying i love the burgers at Farmer Boys the only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of their breakfast. My eggs are always undercooked and the hash browns are not even a bit tasty. Fix the breakfast and you guys will earn my full support."}
{"text":"Lots of haters for this place but I wanted to try it and it was really good.  Got the simple big cheese and it was priced well and looked good. And it tasted good.  Like 650 calories but it's a fresher, nicer looking whopper basically.  Id eat here again.  Too many In and Out snobs in the valley won't branch out."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food! Sure, it takes a second longer than McDonalds to get your food, but the service is amazing and I've never had better fried zucchini better than theirs! I try to get something different every time I go and I have yet to be disappointed!! Absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Every Wednesday meet up with friends for noon lunch. This week...Farmer Boys, one of three in Vegas.  I bought the daily special, barbecue chicken wrap, comes with onion rings and a soda, (I chose water).  My wrap was ok, bland a bit but for the price it's a decent sandwich. Onion rings were bland too.  My buddies burgers were good.  VERY friendly and professional staff. The customer walks up to counter to order which takes time after choosing a long table for us. No menus are available at the tables.  It's a decent place but with so many restaurants available for lunch, I probably won't return but there is a good market at this price and location near dense population/day time business to be profitable. 5stars for staff. 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"Came back for the breakfast only 2 stars. Maybe because it was on busy saturday  morning for them. Eggs where supposed to be medium,hash browns was supposed to be crispy,English toast was cold and their margarine type butter did not melt,was a complete fail! Got a box for the eggs to go, dog food was the eggs. The man said he would come back,maybe another try for me. Sad I was looking forward to their breakfast,it's my favorite meal anytime. He did say I make a better breakfast...points for my man."}
{"text":"came here because a friend had a BOGO coupon for burgers. the deal ended up being a wash cuz you have to buy 1 burger and 2 drinks to get a free burger. since we were getting it to go... we really didn't need to spend $4 on 2 sodas when we could just spend $3 and change for a second burger. it would have been a waste.   anyway.. we ordered the two burgers for our friends... i got the country fried chicken go bowl.. and my other friend got the chicken club.   my country fried chicken was not what i expected. the chicken was more like breaded fried chicken fast food places use in a crispy chicken sandwich. think... carl's jr value chicken sandwich. the rest of the bowl consisted of hashbrowns.. and dry scrambled eggs that were trying to hide beneath the country gravy.   luckily.. it was a friday and the go bowls were on the specials menu for the day. instead of paying $6.19 for just the bowl.. the special was $4.99 for a soda and the bowl. it was an awesome deal!! but i would not order it again.  from what i could tell.. the burgers and sandwich were okay but nothing spectacular. i dont think i would come back on my own but if someone brought me food from here i wouldnt mind giving the burgers a chance.   avoid the go bowls at all costs!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't the worst. That's all I have to say about that.  Nah, I'll say a few more things...  The menu is for sure a little over-whelming for a first timer. The salads, which all look really good, are a tad bit too pricey for me. It's lettuce, c'mon peeps.   Now. I had the regular cheeseburger and was very disappointed. The burger patty was pre-formed (boo) and cooked correctly, but the bun was cold and tough. Me no likey. Nothing about the burger made my mouth water.  I ordered my burger with onion rings. Some people like them thick, some thin. I am on team THIN. Don't get the onion rings here if you like 'em thin. They are over an inch and a half wide with an enormous amount of breading on them. You actually need to cut them to be able to dip them into any sauce.  It's like they cut a whole onion in half and began to drop them into the frying batter. There was so much batter that the onion barely cooked. Gross.   I may give them another chance because my friend Mark B. is a real burger lover and we promised to take him there to try the burgers.   I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants to get blown away by awesomeness. Rather, if you'd like to revisit the leather strap that daddy spanked your buns with as a child, order the onion rings."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend not long ago and I was very happy with the barn burner burger. The fried jalapeÃ±os were so tasty. My boyfriend got the salad and said it was good, it looks very fresh and it was a large portion. The fried zucchini was surprisingly huge, and although it wasn't my favorite it was prepared well and I only didn't like it because of personal preference. If you download the app you get 5 dollars off your meal which made our two meals only 13$. It was very clean and fast and fresh food."}
{"text":"Love it here ! My boyfriend is from riverside county and when we go visit we always stop here . I'm so happy we have a few here in Las Vegas ! This is NOT fast food . It's more like a Denny's on crack that has a drive thru . Although this place is so much better then Denny's . Their portions are huge so be prepared to take food home . I usually get the club and take half of it home . Their frites and onion rings are amazing . Staff is always friendly and willing to help ."}
{"text":"What is this place?? Is it a restaurant? Or is it fast food?? hmmmm  Definitely an interesting concept that seems to work really well. Decor is odd and random but the atmosphere is fun.   Huge portions and quick service is offered here and the food is pretty good but I do agree that it is pricier than your typical fast food spot.   I had the Farmer's Burger with onion rings and for a lunch mean it got me a little too full, which is my fault for not putting the onion rings down and walking away.   I am curious of their other menu choices because their burger and onion rings were legit, so I would think the other options would satisfy anyone's hunger pains."}
{"text":"Nice place away from the strip.  Just a short 10 minute drive. A great selection of items. Staff is very friendly  Would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been to farmer boys numerous times, first time at this location. I had the pastrami, which was a bit smaller than expecting but tasty. I would like to mention the great service I received with a packed place during lunch time. Manager and staff were prompt and accurate with my order while keeping up with the other dozens of customers in the place. Also super friendly. Would recommend this location over others for their staff."}
{"text":"Generally like Farmers Boy, but am in the middle of a not-good experience. They took my order at 2:57 pm. I just got it 20 minutes later, but only after I went back to the counter and asked where it was. They brought it out and everything is cold.  I will go to the Farmers Boy on Decatur after this. Really bad service and no apologies for it.  Edited to add: As I was leaving, I asked to speak to the manager on duty, figuring the manager needed to know what had happened. Turned out that the person I had asked about my late order *was* the manager! So the person who could have given this a better outcome didn't give a damn.  Not ever coming back to this FB location! Food was bad too, not usual FB standards. Lowered to one star."}
{"text":"From someone who visits multiple farmer boys this is the worse location. I ordered over $50 worth of food for me and my family and every order was wrong or missing something. The only thing that was right was the drinks and that's because I made them myself from the fountain. The shift leader Morgan has no clue what he's doing. Safe to say, avoid this location"}
{"text":"Review update:  Still the best fish and zucchini I've ever had. The portions are still giant, so two meals for me. Lots of sauces and vinegar makes this girl happy.   New management has worked wonders - excellent, over-the-top service. They get their star back, plus extra invisible ones for the positive changes.   Nom...nom...nom..."}
{"text":"I used to pass on by Farmer Boys, until one day nothing else was around, like today. Take a chance! It's a Good Eat!"}
{"text":"Fries are undercooked burger is dry nothing on it. Burger was frozen no taste. Dining room was disgusting. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Husband and I had the breakfast burrito and turkey blt combo yesterday for a late lunch. Very delicious, especially since it was the only thing we've eaten all day. However, today both of us are really sick..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat always. Good food but from time to time they don't bring out your whole order. Today they forgot my toast again 2 times in a row.y wife's food came out after we were almost done. All in all B+."}
{"text":"First timer, I came here on 8/16 around 9pm and had a very friendly cashier (young male) who gave us excellent service from him taking our order and serving us our food he provided mind blowing service. I was so shocked at how nice and friendly he was. He gave us 5 star service and made sure we were 100% satisfied with our food (which we were). We will definitely be coming back! Keep up the amazing service, young man!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place as I pass it going onto Stephanie all the time. Extremely ordinary hamburger joint. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Had the Bellringer for lunch, really good burger with fresh ingredients and fried zucchinis. The prices are fair for the quality of burger they have.   I like that you can choose either fries or zucchini or a combination of both with your order, depending what your in mood for.   Overall, good food and a good place to go."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Nothing special about their burgers and the cooks don't read the tickets and just make the burger how they feel like it. I'm really picky and asked for my burger plain, they repeated that back twice and still didn't provide that. Fries were really bland. No need to come back especially for the 20-25 minute drive thru wait."}
{"text":"Great, expensive fast food.   The food is great (for fast food, not for the price). The staff is friendly and the place is clean. The zucchini sticks are really really good and really hot."}
{"text":"I've been sitting in the drive through for over 15 minutes. I'm the only one here and they already took my money. I love farmer boys in California but this location has crap service. Still waiting as I type this. I only ordered an omelette. Stay away unless you like slow. Hoping the food isn't cold."}
{"text":"FarmerBoys off of centennial is honestly my new favorite place!! Every time I've come here the customer service is wonderful- but Nicole is an absolute doll! The fries and zucchini are great too!!!"}
{"text":"Loved my burger and fries. The employees were super happy and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try breakfast."}
{"text":"First time we ate in.  Used the drive-thru prior to this visit and had a better experience.  From the time we walked in I was not impressed.  I looked around the dining area and saw numerous dirty tables. By the time we ordered, filled our drink cups for which we were told they had run out of straws, and walked the dining area for a table---the dirty tables were STILL DIRTY.  I asked one of the employees to please clean our table and she stated she would be \"right back.\"  TEN MINUTES LATER and watching her clean OTHER DIRTY tables, I asked her a second time to please clean our table before the food came out.  She apologized and came over.  In the meantime, we sat for 20 minutes waiting for my BLT sandwich with onion rings (which were semi raw--I don't like raw onions) and my daughter's Southwest Wrap which had the wrong dressing on it! Next, there were no napkins on the table. Thought I had missed them somewhere, but I was told by the employee that they're supposed to be on the tables...there were no napkins on the tables or anywhere to grab them. She brought some out to us, at that point. The final blow was that they somehow mustered up some straws and were walking around from table to table asking if you wanted a straw. Overall, very disappointing...under staffed to say the least!  A check paid of $22 and change for one mishap after another. I walked out of there still hungry. Next time I will return to my favorite restaurant in that corner area....RAISING CANES."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 30+ times and it has always been good but today my fiancee ordered a bacon burrito and I ordered the burner burger and they were very sub par  The bacon burrito came out just terrible.  The hash browns were completely raw crunchy starchy raw inside burrito.  I complained said these are clearish white raw potatoes yuck.  The cashier takes it back she says hey the hasbrowns are under done and somehow brings it back in 3 minutes wait how did they make another one with the normal melty goodness of the breakfast burrito so the eggs were burned completely raw clearish onions added and the wrapper was soaked in oil the potatoes that were under done are now paste brown really wtf I have had this burrito many times it's usually very good.  Thanks for ruining our lunch it inedible with burned eggs and somehow oil dripping out.  Gross and demeaning for devoted customers.  On top I ordered the burner burger and the jalapenos were cooked to paper so over done I had to remove them so I could eat the dry beef this burger is always juicy and juicy jalapenos wtf famer boys why did you guys miss treat very loyal customers did I say something wrong to you?"}
{"text":"I had the Farmer Boy burger.  It looked awesome in the photos with the guacamole and those fat patties.  I sad to report that the burger was really disappointing.   Guac: The guacamole portioning is so dismal that I couldn't see if from the outside of the burger.  I had to open up the top to see it.    Pickles Anyone?: They had also put two pieces of pickles outside of the burger.  I get it, some people don't like pickles and you want to give customers the choice. But! there were also pickles inside the burger too! That was certainly interesting.    Patty: These were densely packed patties, kind of what you get at McD's.  For a $7 burger and the advertised \"1/2 lbs\" I expected better.  Buns: The buns were big enough to span the whole burger, but they weren't adequate for actually holding the burger together.  About half way through, my buns ripped in half and the burger fell apart.  I had mayo running down the side of my hand.   Service: ok so the only reason this gets more than one star is the staff.  They were generally very friendly.  I was about to clean up the table and take the tray to the trash when a staff member offered to take care of it for me.  That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Updating review from 1 star to 5! I was told they have new staff and management. Marion was great in the drive thru. No line. Fresh food made in a timely manner.  This location definitely got redemption.  Iced Tea, Tuna melt with grilled onions and zucchini were perfect!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and got a breakfast burrito with no eggs, extra hash browns (there was no charge for the extra hashbrowns). It was very good but I wasn't able to finish it so my boyfriend had the rest. He liked it so much, we decided to go back today for another. We got 2 this time: no eggs, no salsa, extra hash browns, extra cheese. This time I was charged a side of hash browns with a side not saying \"split on burritos\" by a woman named Rosie, who I believe is the manager.. Okay, no problem I'll pay whatever as long I get what I ordered. We get our burritos and drive to work. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE EXTRA $$$ I WAS CHARGED. And by a manager, none the less. I'm not upset that I was charged extra, I'm upset that the manager felt so annoyed by my special order she felt the need to charge me an extra side of hash browns which I wasn't charged for just YESTERDAY and then didn't deliver quality food. My guess is the cooks didn't read her side note to split it on the burritos and sent an actual side of hashbrowns and then they didn't bag it and give it to me. As a manager, she should be on top of things. Especially if you're going to complicate things by charging side items to be added and then not ensure it is what was ordered. My experience yesterday would have earned them 5 stars, but tack on today's experience.. 2 stars. And none of those go to Rosie."}
{"text":"Way too expensive even with a coupon for the quality and amount that you get. Okay burgers, good fries. Definitely not our go to."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner today and as always, the food was amazing!! Everything is always fresh and made in a reasonable amount of time. We have gone in last visits but today was different. As soon as we sat down we were greeted by a girl named Aaliyah. She asked if we needed refills, took our trash as needed to be thrown away, and constantly checked up on us. She was super friendly for a place who doesn't wait tables. This girl deserves a promotion, she makes your restaurant look amazing. Keep it up! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food and faster then most farmer boys! Was given the coupon for a combo, but would pay full price regardless."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. I spent $20 on two burritos and a Coca Cola, was the second person in line, and waited over 20 minutes. This was my first time here and I will never go back the food is disgusting they do not give you appropriate size portions for what you pay. Very poor service. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and onion rings. I had the zucchini sticks which were delicious. The calorie content is listed on the menu so you know what you are getting yourself into. The burgers were decently sized, fresh, and seasoned nicely."}
{"text":"Absolutely Horrible! The worst Farmers Boys I gotten food from. The Burger patties tasted like they had been sitting all day. The chicken strips were hard as rock and dry as cardboard. Save your money and don't visit this Farmer Boys...Absolutely Horrible!!!'"}
{"text":"I cannot give a zero star and in this case that is a travesty. I drove all the way across town to try the newest Farmer Boys. It was just before 7 on Sunday and I was informed as I walked through the doors that they serve breakfast all day. So I ordered an omelet and was told they have no eggs. Not a totally wasted trip since I was really in the mood for a shake. As I ordered the young lady said no shakes either, we are all out. These were the highlights of the experience. I will never be back to this location or any other Farmer Boys. They just lost a twice a week customer for the last 3 years."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service. I usually love this location but my recent visit was awful. The cashier seem like she was paying no attention because she kept repeating my order wrong and when she repeated it back right she still gave it to me wrong. I said vanilla shake 3 times and she still gave me a strawberry shake. I also ordered fruit side and my grapes had mildew. Disgusting!!! I spent about 45$ and the manager only offered to give me the 3$ back from my fruit. On top of all that the food wasn't enough good. Couldn't enough finish eating it."}
{"text":"Part of my childhood was spent in the Inland Empire so Farmer Boys was a fairly present chain there. I always liked the one by our house there as I'm one of those people who doesn't really like processed type fast foods.   First time we ordered up at the drive thru and the fiance, my MIL and I shared all the items.   Patty melt - this was a pretty solid patty melt. Crispy, properly melted, onions were sweet. Patty could have been thicker (and I swear it used to be back in CA).   Farmer Burger - pretty decent burger. It's never been my favorite burger, but I'll take this over most.  Farmer Club - The ciabatta was interesting, though I prefer requesting double decker sliced bread for this sandwich. Generous layer of ham,turkey, bacon and  the veggies were crisp.   Zucchini spears- needed to be fried a tad more as the batter was slidin off and not as crisp as it could be. Onion Rings were nice and sweet, but again needed a little more time in the fry.   It takes a while a everything is made to order so you may be in the drive thru for 5-10 minutes. I recommend calling first, then driving to there to pick it up instead.   So the next visit we did just that. Called in our order as we live in the area, went through the drive thru to pick it up.   Breakfast Burritos were good, but the hash browns could have used time to crisp up as they were soft. They were doing a 2 hotcakes for $1 add on and they were fine, a bit more on the chewy side than soft.   The people who work here have been super friendly both times and packed up utensils, sauces, napkins and double checked the order before giving it to us.   I think the fact that they have a drive thru and marketed as fast food gets people bitching about their prices as they are compared to other fast foods. I rather get a real egg than egg omelette McDonalds \"mix\" that comes out a box so comparing a lesser item isn't exactly fair. And when it comes to something comparable, it's not exactly cheaper, but all priced the same: Farmer burger vs Carls Jr Six Dollar Burger - $5 and some change. But I digress.   Overall, I guess I'm glad for nostalgia it's here, but they can improve on the finer details of preparing the food. I used to always get zucchini spears, onion rings and ham breakfast burritos all the time as a teen and I still do really like those items."}
{"text":"So, I'm here ordering through the drive through! I'm told no large drinks and no ice cream!!!! So, confused!   I see ice cream and shakes on the sign!  I'm once again told no ice cream all though I see thrifty by the gallons.  I decide to go inside once inside I speak with the manager Angel and he  explains to me they are out of large cups and they prepackaged the shakes with the thrifty ice cream.  I explain to him that I just wanted some ice cream  Angel says that's just not the way we do it, she told you that.  I responded I will take it to the internet!  Angel said what ever!!!!  Sign says hand blended ice cream.   Hand blended shakes.    One would think you could get some ice cream and maybe a shake!"}
{"text":"When Farmer Boys first opened we ate their a couple times a week. Loved it! Great customer service! After a year I feel everything fell apart. Not sure if they are owned by someone new or what happened. Anyway fast forward six months...we decided to give them another try. Both times cold food (just like before). The friendly workers are gone. Just not what it was when it first opened. Very disappointed! I'm attaching a pic of my hashbrowns with cheese. The hashbrowns were cold and as you can see the cheese is unmelted!  Gonna delete my Farmer Boy app and move on."}
{"text":"This location is awesome! All employees were smiling and hard working. Food was hot, and  served within a reasonable time.  Very clean restaurant. All tables had plenty of napkins, jelly, etc. A couple staff members came over to check on us and see if we needed anything. Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"And they have a drive through, whaaat?! haha!   Ok so this one is going to be short. Located in the Home Depot plaza on the corner of Tropical and Centennial, this spot has plenty parking. Didn't know it was a fast food joint, then there was the order at the counter set-up. Greeted as soon as we entered, we noticed that the staff was very friendly and inviting. (really friendly) Servers constantly talking to customers, making sure they are taken care of.. Oh and clean. All table tops were wiped clean soon as customers left. The drive thru was steady, didn't see it backed up.  They have a great variety on their menu ranging from breakfast bowls, salads, and omelettes to burgers and fried fish. What is really neat here is, next to each menu item is their calorie count. This is for all you health nuts.  What ordered:  Farmers burger with fried zucchini  California omelette   So I was thinking, awesome customer service, awesome food. We were brought our food after about a 15-20 minute wait, and the first thing I noticed was the gigantic zucchini. Probably the only thing I loved fro my order. Food was great in portion, not in flavor. Your better off at a Carl's Jr. or better yet Shuck's Tavern for their juicy Shuck burger for $8 rather the $10 combo here. The burger here was dry. Fresh onions and tomatoes though. The omelette was ok. Wife was not wowed, meaning not amazing or unique. It's fast food breakfast though right? I'd come back for those monster zucchinis, and maybe to try their fried fish which boasts a wopping 2000 calories. It's better than Mcy-Ds, is all I can say."}
{"text":"Service is excellent, compliments the food!!! I've been a few times now and never dissapoints.  Must try- fried zucchini, sour dough soup bowls, cobb salad.  I am looking forward to exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"Like most fast food joints, this place is repulsive. Props to them for having a vegetarian burger on the menu though. Perhaps this place wouldn't be so gross to me if I wasn't coerced into eating there so much.  The first time we went, I thought it was alright, but the veggie burger wasn't impressive, being oily and just as bad for you as anything else they make. After revisiting the place a few times, I couldn't even stomach the burger anymore. I've tried a few other things on the menu, including the farmhand bowl and some of their breakfast things.  Even worse. It's great if you're starving and in a hurry, but unappetizing if you have other options. Of course after awhile I finally put my foot down and refused to go back, never again."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is very close to my home... I have eaten at this location since they opened...  The burgers are pretty good, and reasonably priced... Burgers are what they are known for,,, I have also ordered the Hot Pastrami,,  served on a ciabatta roll with pickle, provolone and mustard... I like it,,,   The fried veggies are good,, not a big fan of the onion rings, they are large, and dont seem to cook,, the fries, are fries..  I like the fish and chips,,, The fish is pollack,,, i dont know if its battered there or comes in frozen,,, not the best but it hit the spot for 6.95,,, how much i a 3 peice at Long John Siilver about the same.. I had had the cobb salad, its a nice size, worth the 6.95...        In closing i would eat here over all the fast food joints in town... Burgers are good, on par with the chains like ruby tuesay, fridays, etc  definitely better than the fast food burgers even IN/OUT...  Try it,, its ok better quality for the buck in my opinion..."}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money. My mother ranted and raved about this zucchini, and was so excited to get a location on our side of town. It took a while to get it, and it was horrible. Soggy I can deal with, but it was almost moist underneath the batter that instantly fell off. Welcome to the neighborhood Farmer Boys..... I guess."}
{"text":"Their food is good but service can be really slow! On this visit we went at 1:00 in the afternoon. I know it was lunchtime but after 15 minutes waiting I asked them to pack our order to go because my daughter was going to be late for her first day on a new job. She did not have time to eat which I was really upset about. I will eat there again because I like the food but I will make sure I am in no hurry."}
{"text":"Just had a breakfast sandwich here for the first time and it was delicious. The morning manager Jonathan does a great job opening the restaurant and making sure the coffee is hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I have been eating here for a couple months now and it was good, then yesterday my food tasted horrible and when I called to get the situation corrected they were not accommodating at all and acted like I was lying about to get a free meal. I will never go back to any restaurant that won't except responsibly for the food. What ever happened to customer service?????. I will never eat there again and recommend if to hear here just know they don't care if you like the food or not. Terrible management!!!!!!+"}
{"text":"We had Alisa help us. She is a rare combination of friendliness and sincerity. Management take notice, people like this should be  taken care of and promoted so they can try to replicate that level of genuine service. Now for the food: it was fast food but not crappy fast food. Kind of a cross between fast food and family-owned places if that makes sense. We will return. Gets an little busy during typical eating hours. Breakfast served all day is a bonus."}
{"text":"The hamburger was fresh and good, but service was a bit slow.  I asked for mustard and ketchup on it instead of thousand island and the bun and sandwich were saturated with the mustard.  I used up about 5 napkins sopping up the extra mustard and the sandwich was pretty much over run with the mustard taste as a result.  The onion rings were sweet and pretty good.  The restaurant was clean. I should have shown them the mustard and gotten a new bun, but it had taken so long for the order and I was hungry that I didn't bother to do it."}
{"text":"Gone downhill. Burger patty was smaller, cheese was cheaper, food was cold."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, it really doesn't get better than this place. Really great selection of freshly made food. Burgers are the most touted items, but I think they're ok. You get the fast food thinner patty, restaurant quality toppings, but I always find that the burgers are too substantial for the bun. They have a drive-thru, but be prepared to wait a little for your food. If you decide to eat there, they'll bring your food to you and clean your plates too. It's a nice touch, but if you're like me and feel like you need to leave a tip when people clean up after you, bring a couple bucks to leave on the table. I felt super guilty the first time I ate there and had no cash for them. I really like the different options they have. You can get a burger, chicken fingers, fish, breakfast, salads, soup, and homemade milkshakes. And the zucchini..I love friend zucchini. It's not slices, but big spears. It cuts the top of your mouth, but I still order it every time I'm there. Everyone there is really cordial and helpful."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and open late.  My favorite thing to eat for dinner is breakfast. This place nailed it! Everything tastes amazing and I'm definitely coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The food here tastes different which is good and it tastes amazing which is great. Farmer boys always has great food. I'm happy they have opened this new location!"}
{"text":"Well they struck out before we even ate! Walked in at 6:30am (they open at 6am) When we walked in there was one lady that we could see on the grill in the back we waited patiently for about 4 min at which point she looked right at us and continued to ignore us. She was wearing a drive thru head set so I know she could take orders. At this point I asked \"Is anyone going to help us?\" No response. I said \"Hello! Can you come take our order?\" At this point she told me to go to the drive thru. I'm sorry but if the lobby was still closed you should have told us as soon as we came in or you should have locked the doors. This was 30 minutes after they opened get your crap together!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the breakfast... Namely the coffee... For a very reasonable price.   Being las vegas, you don't go into places expecting \"southern hospitality\" but the staff was very friendly. Restrooms clean and again great fast food coffee.  A very restaurant feel with the fast food quality of a franchise as this. My only concern is for this comoany to branch back towards chicagoland"}
{"text":"Not all farmer boys restaurants are the same. I have been to a number of them in Southern California and they are a known quantity, so when I travel through North Las Vegas I have tried to hit this Farmer boys location. Prepared for a line, I came in on a Sunday evening and the only real line was the drive-through window. With no one in front of me, I waited more than five minutes to have someone take my order. no one was at the counter, and there was no one in front of me or behind me. Two people on headsets were busy taking orders from the drive-through window which progressed nicely. I finally ordered, and then proceeded to see a number of people in the drive-through window be served their food first, at least for cars. While waiting, a young family entered the restaurant went to the counter and we're helped immediately. When I was finally served, I took my food to go and, of course, fries were cold. The order and manner in which customers are served is important. Customers notice, even if employees do not. I will not be back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this farmer boys. The service is great the staff is friendly. I ordered a  ceasar salad and it was so good, the chicken was good. I come here and I have never been disappointed at all. Would recommend 100%"}
{"text":"OK That's it I am changing my entire review. This is the last time I will ever go to this location again. Last time they packed the fish platter and the zucchini (7pcs) into ONE container it actually cracked the bottom of the plastic platter and the bag was ripped . We had no idea if we'd get it into the house in one piece. Also the drive thru is ridiculous slow & they forgot some extras , but I let it go since they were new (ish) .  Today, The clerk was nice she got the order right, so we are thinking \"good finally the service is better... \" Nope! Almost everything was old and soggy. Very expensive for food when you throw out 80% of it... the stuff that did get eaten was only because of hunger and no one wanting to drive back in the dark...  Soggy food should not be served , food with the breading falling off should not be served. period. It's really not that hard folks..."}
{"text":"The food is good but they consistently \"forget\" part of your order. It is beyond annoying to get home and have to go all the way back to get the rest of your order while the hot food at home gets cold and soggy."}
{"text":"I generally put fast food into two categories, sort of an upper and lower class of fast food.  I know I'm elitist but I think there is a real difference between Carls Jr. and McDonalds.  Farmer Boys definitely goes int he upper category but it does something else also.  The food is ordered at a counter and then taken to your table.  the food is definitely made to order but made quickly.  So it is a fast food joint, just with really tasty food.  Oh and a pretty huge price tag.  The portions are good, the food is tasty but you pay restaurant prices for things.  I think my burger was about $8.00 and while a super deluxe whopper can run $5 or so, going to a chain restaurant like Applebee's or Chili's is about $8-9.  The decor is sort of tastefully tacky?  Kind of a Beverly Hillbillies vibe.  There's lots of simple country affect but with chandeliers and fancy faux french thrown in.  I thought it was a hoot but I was laughing at them, not with them.  I would definitely eat there again, the food was really tasty but i wouldn't be hitting them up 3x a week or anything."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 egg breakfast but the bacon and hash browns were way too over cooked. I also ordered a shake and I had to get up twice to ask for my shake."}
{"text":"Not sure why I just waited 15 minutes to get a cold burger and fries, but that's what happened. The burger tasted OK, I guess, but definitely not worth the wait. They sent me from the drive-through window to the parking lot to wait (I was only the 3rd in line at the window). I was getting out of my car to go ask for my money back when they finally brought the bag out. Burger and fries both cold and kind of soggy. Found myself actually wishing I'd just hit McDonald's. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries.  A little expensive. There was a couple of flies in the dining room."}
{"text":"Quick Review:   The burger was pretty good, nothing amazing, but definitely better than say Carl's Jr. or Jack in the Box.  Not quite In n Out.  The Patty Melt was delicious and is served on rye bread with grilled onions as it should be.  The fries were average and a little soggy.  I was actually really excited about the onion rings because in the picture they look like they are crispy and flavorful.  They were neither.  Very bland, the breading was all falling off and they too were quite soggy.  I would go back to try try some of the other items on the menu because they have quite a selection of non burger items that look and sound delicious.  I forgive them on the onion rings, because I should know that what you get almost never looks like the picture."}
{"text":"They have the classics for breakfast in fast food form..which I love but their burgers and chili fried are good here too..just your typical breakfast and burger and sandwich joint.I don't have any spectacular news to give you here but be prepared to spend a.little more than your usual fast food joint"}
{"text":"This review is based on the prices, not the food. Here's what I have to say, WHY would I pay you $12.00 for a burger combo and it's not even Niman Ranch or Kobe Beef? Farmer Boys have lost their last mind. You're a burger place, that's it, the meat is not organic, neither is the vegetables you're using. You have a drive-thru just like McDonalds. So I am in line, the man in front of me orders 3 things and his total is $42.00 FOR WHAT! I told my husband, and he's the cheap one, not me, I guess In-N-Out and Tommy's will continue to be our best friend before I pay a burger joint $42 dollars to feed three people. And mind you, I've eaten at FB in California and I don't remember these outrageous prices for NON ORGANIC BURGERS! This BURGER JOINT, belongs on the STRIP, NOT in a family neighborhood with young children. You know what I noticed when I left and went to In-N-Out around the corner (BTW, the lines were around the block) it appears that everyone in the In-N-Out line was skidding into the parking lot. I told my husband they must of just left FB. LOL Will I return to FB, of course, I want a pastrami sandwich, lol, will I ever purchase a burger from FB, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!"}
{"text":"Really good quality breakfast food here.  It was a long wait but I guess you ha e to wait for fresh made food.  It was 5 cars deep in the drive thru.  The food was good and a bit pricey but I'll come back again for another try before giving up."}
{"text":"All In all it was a miss.   I pass by this place 6 times a week on my way to the gym & it's normally closed when I'm leaving the gym. Tonight I decided to give it a try.   The cashier didn't know what all came on the bbq chicken salad when I asked her. She told me she would check and come right back. She came back and named off 3 things & then stated that she forgot the rest. I laughed and asked her if she was new and she stated that she wasn't, but doesn't like salads.   Well... Nice to know the staff picks and chooses what they feel they need to know. That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. What if someone is allergic to something and the cashier doesn't give a damn to actually learn this stuff? I notice on the picture of the BBQ chicken salad on the overhang had eggs on it. I asked her if the eggs would also be on it if I ordered the salad as a wrap. Her response, \"Probably\". Well, thanks for that..... By the way, it didn't come in the wrap.  Next, the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was slow inside the lobby & yet the condiment & beverage area was FILTHY! Littered with lids, straw papers, and napkins. I get it. People are disgusting assholes, but clean your damn areas! The floor was sticky like it hasn't been mopped in a while.   Let's talk food. I was surprised that the wrap itself is red. It was a beautiful display! I felt rather cheated though. It was packed to the brim with lettuce. Little chicken. Chicken was dry & flavorless. Barely dressed at all in the BBQ sauce I thought I'd be getting. Also packed to the brim with BURNT bacon. I'm not a huge bacon eater, but can usually tolerate it. This.... This was like when you'd eat captain crunch as a kid and it would be like WW3 with the roof of your mouth & gums. I took my food to the counter and asked if it was suppose to have so much bacon, that the bacon is burned, and there wasn't any egg in it. It was stated that the way they made it is correct. No apology that it was burnt. No apologies for the non existence of the eggs. Nothing."}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food person but in a pinch I go to Farmer Boys. I've had nothing but positive experiences with the food and customer service. On a Thursday night I bought the fish dinner and it was enough to last me all weekend, even the salad which was a big portion itself and stayed fresh for 3 days. They gave me tons of condiments and the drive thru lady served it with a smile. It's my go to place for a quality fast food meal."}
{"text":"It took 17 minutes in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me.  The fried zucchini was really bad, as you can see from the picture. The burger was so so.  Next time I will stick with Fat Boyz on Horizon."}
{"text":"Fantastic hearty breakfast! Wow and all the staff are extremely nice!! I used the 20% discount & had a very tasty farmers bowl that Completely filled me up for the day! Stop by & enjoy their organic farm raised menu & welcoming atmosphere by all the staff."}
{"text":"I really like their food, especially their breakfast burritos and chocolate shakes. The service can be a little slow sometimes. I've gone there to eat at the restaurant and ordered the same thing to go and the to go meal is like 1/2 to 3/4 of the meal you eat there. When I bring it up to then they argue and say it's not true. Whatever. I will continue to go here but only for their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Quality food that is pricey for fast food, and way too slow to be fast food.  I think of it as a diner that has a drive-thru.  I just waited 15 minutes for food now.  For a diner, somewhat acceptable.  For a place that acts like it's fast food, completely unacceptable.  Makes it difficult to want to return."}
{"text":"Very fresh, not a huge fan of the fries but the zucchini... Yummmmmmmmmmmm  I rarely eat hamburgers but this place has me craving them more often."}
{"text":"Place is nice. That's all about it. Food wasn't that great at all. I should've went to in and out. We order extreme bacon burger combo, kids burger,!zucchini and Boston clam chowder and we already pay $30!! So expensive and the burger was salty and burnt. I wonder how they survive being open. We waited long time for our food and ask server if we can get waters for the kids and she ask us if we want ice on the water and we said yes. That was the last time we saw her. Never came back with the water. And guess what?!? She was the manager of the store too. This is our first time eating here and I definitely told my wife that this is the last time too. If you guys are looking for a good burger joint go to In N Out. Cheaper and you will be satisfied to your food. By the way I give 1 star coz I like the place. I'll give -5 stars on food."}
{"text":"Drove all the way down here for the cheeseburger combo special and she said that's not for this location??  Nevermind!  Thankfully Jaime was an awesome server and made me forget!!!"}
{"text":"very disappointed.  Ive eaten at a lot of Farmer boys in California and I know their burgers are  very good....but  I stopped for a breakfast burrito ok it was $6.09 but it should be big and good well it was small very small and very dry not enough cheese not enough hashbrowns alltogether DRY and SMALL for $6!!! what  a rip   I hope I get over it by my next trip out there so I can enjoy a farmer boys burger  DONT get the breakfast burrito  not worth $2    very disapointed."}
{"text":"Burger was dry and overdone and the bun was gummy. Tasted of raw flour. Many other burger emporiums more deserving of my dollars."}
{"text":"Saturday morning, after dropping a friend off at work, my fella and I were hungry.   Our first choice wasn't open yet, and so we drove around, and ended up back close to home, when we saw Farmer Boys.  We've seen Farmer Boys on several occasions, but have never stopped to try them.   We decided to give them a go.  We walked in and looked at the menu.  Burgers, breakfasts, salads...they have a pretty good selection! We ordered one Bacon Boy meal, with a soda and half and half zucchini sticks and fries, and 1 Bacon Boy, burger only.  $18.    I was worried.  $18 for fast food?  What?    Then, we got our food, and let me tell you...it was absolutely worth the price.  Those burgers are HUGE!  They're seasoned well, and have really fresh toppings.  The zucchini sticks were enormous, and really tasty.  Fries were average.  The service was good too!  Very personable, and we were checked on frequently.    Two thumbs up!  I'll come back again, for sure."}
{"text":"I come here all the time on my lunch breaks and this morning I was really looking forward to a good burger and fries... unfortunately I received a charbroiled burger and it ruined the whole meal! Very disappointed! They were not busy at all and couldn't even cook a patty without burning it! The customer service at this location seems to be going down hill and sadly there isn't much in this area food wise for business in this area.  Extremely disappointing!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. After having worked in the service industry for more than a decade and becoming accustomed to ever worsening customer service, it was refreshing to have genuinely delightful customer service."}
{"text":"I'm digging the fast food/sit down hybrid concept although it honestly felt more fast food to me. Prices were appropriate for portions and quality. The real question is - how good were the burgers?!  Farmer Burger ($5.69)  - still Low carbing so I requested a lettuce wrap (not on the menu, but they had no problems accomodating). The meat itself is in thin patties - very fast food and I think the ones at say In n out are yummier and a bit cheaper. What this place has that you can't get at In n Out is bacon and avocado on the burger! Although the avocados were mashed, they did taste like genuine avocados - NOT some guac processed mushy crap. The bacon was nice and crisp and better than your typical fast food bacon. Honestly my lettuce wrapped burger was a bit of a mess (In n Out has that protein style thing DOWN PAT), but it was overall tasty and being able to get avocado on my burger at  fast food place is pretty sweet !   Their salads also looked awesome - way better looking than anything you could get at MCD's/Wendy's. Definitely will be back to try that Cobb salad with 10 net carbs that was calling my name!   Overall a nice change from the usual fast food burgers. Avocado lovers rejoice !"}
{"text":"First and last time going here. Completely messed up the order even though the receipt was correct.  Should have read the reviews. Obviously they don't care about customers."}
{"text":"I just waited 30 minutes in line for 4 drinks , I get up too the window and I'm watching one of the workers get his drink in his personal plastic blue cup ! Not only did he piss me off so did the girl that walked up to the window looked at my order infront of her face and walk away I am so pissed I will never return ."}
{"text":"I stopped by Farmer Boys the other night to give them another try.  This time I ordered the \"Bell Ringer\" which is a 1/2lb double cheeseburger with the usual toppings, some onion rings, and a drink.  I have to say the burger this time was very good. The meat had a much better flavor than I remember my last burger had, and the toppings were in better proportion as well. Plenty of onions and tomato this time. I decided to leave the bacon off this time. Not sure if they improved that as well, but the burger was very good without it.  As for the onion rings, they tasted good enough, but IMO they cut the onions way too wide. When you take a bite out of one a lot of the breading crumbles off because it doesn't stick to the onion very well. Also, even though you probably end up getting a fair amount of actual food by weight, an order of onion rings comes with only 4 rings. It feels like you're getting shorted.   I'll definitely be back for the double cheeseburger though. So, extra star awarded."}
{"text":"This was only my third time here since this location opened. I recently went keto and I was looking for a place with both keto and vegetarian options (my daughter is a vegetarian). The first time I came here, I got an omelet. The second time, breakfast again. Food was good both times, but the service was TERRIBLE.  This time, the good was fantastic, but again with the service. I went through the drive thru and had to repeat my order three times. I got through the line fairly quickly, but when we pulled out, we realized we were missing part of our order. At $7 a burger, that is just not acceptable. I ran back in and they gave me the missing item, but they treated me like I was trying to get free food. My daughter and I really enjoyed our food, but if we hadn't, we wouldn't be going back here. My daughter said the veggie burger was the best she had ever had."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review strictly on the last 3 visits I had to this location. I use to come here all the time (at least 3 times a week). I really enjoyed the variety that they have to offer. The first time I had a bad experience was when I went in and they got my order completely wrong. I order the BBQ chicken wrap and the girl taking my order brought out a salad instead. I had expressed to them this is not what I ordered and they fixed it. It was simply just her not listening to what I wanted to eat. Need I remind you that this is not my first time here, nor would it be my last because I enjoy eating here. So about a week later I came in and because I was craving 2 things I actually just ordered 2 kids meals. After finishing what I was hungry for, I still had remaining food so I went to go up to the front to ask for a to go box. Because it takes them so long to do anything at this location I turn around to head back over to my seat and box up my food, except my food wasn't there!!!! The girl working there had my food in her hand at the trash and was throwing it away! So I went up to her and mentioned I was up getting a box for the whole sandwich I had left that she just threw away. She just responded sorry I thought you left. She didn't even offer to get me another one! I was pissed at that point and just left. So today is what brings me to writing this review. I showed up around 11am and was hungry for breakfast food. The the same girl that has messed my orders up multiple times was taking orders. I told her I would like the daybreak sandwich with fries and a small soda. She then starts asking what kind of bread do I want and hash browns, etc. so I simply ask her this all comes with this sandwich? And she replys yes. Then she gives me a grand total of $12 and some change. I look at her and say that is not right. The sandwich is 4 something and the fries and drink together are 4 something..... I said that's not right! I told her are u sure you got the right sandwich and she replys \"oh you want the sandwich?\" Ahh yes that's that I ordered if you were listening! So then she rings up what I repeated from the first time I ordered. And gives me a grand total of $11 and some change. No, this still can't be right I tell her.... she then gives me a BS excuse of how the tax went up because of the raiders coming to town? Wth? No so I give her my card and she swipes it for that amount. The receipt prints out and sure enough she charges me for 2 sodas. The line was already long at this point so I said I would just come back up and get it resolved. So I walk away to find a spot and she comes over and hands me cash totaling $1.94, I wasn't even gonna say anything, but come on the soda is $1.99.... you didn't even give me the correct money back. Anyways I waited until after I was done eating my meal and went up to inform her that she gave me the wrong change back and she still owed me. She said oh do I owe you 2 cents? No! You don't.... I mean it's 2017! The computers tell you what to give back in change (including tax caused from the raiders). Lmao! So instead of confusing her anymore, I ask to speak to the manager. He comes over and I explain to him that she charged me for 2 sodas and I wanted it credited back on my card because I don't want all this change she game me. So he now also mentioned the tax went up in Las Vegas! Hmmm I work in retail which has the same tax percentage as food and yes it went up but it went up at least 6 months ago! Anyways he credited me back for the full amount and I wasn't expecting it, but honestly that paid for that sandwich that was thrown away last time. This farmer boys has gone downhill so much within the last year! There was a really nice shorter Philippino woman that used to work there and she was always a pleasure to talk to and she really knew what customer service was. I'm very surprised how this location is corporate and not a franchise and I've had way better service at the franchise location off Tropicana. Management needs to train their staff to listen intently to the customers while they are taking their orders and it will save them quite a bit of money on orders they mess up on."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast at this location everything is fresh and good I really love farmer Boys great customer service"}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place, and finally decided to go inside and check it out. There was a hand written note on the back of the register saying something like, \"We apologize but are out of Chicken.  We waited our turn to order, and I asked for clarification from the cashier. He said they were out of ALL grilled chicken. If I wanted fried chicken, we were good. Really? My boyfriend was excited to try this place, but I don't eat burgers. So we left. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"$1 burger day with crazy lines, yet only one register open. Took for ever to order, and they ran out of avocado and fries. Burger was okay, but the onion rings were horrible. Had like a sandpaper batter with a huge slice of onion. Would not come again!!!"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is a fast food joint dressed up as a diner. I came here on a whim for a late breakfast around 1PM. Yeah that's right, I eat breakfast at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. First off, the fact that Farmer Boys serves breakfast throughout the day is a plus. I sleep in on the weekends so I can never make the breakfast cut off at 10AM. I stepped up to the register after awkwardly staring at the menu for 2 minutes and ordered a french toast combo for $6.69. My husband also opted for breakfast and ordered a sausage burrito ($6.49). Total after tax and a drink came to to $16 and some change.   We were handed a number and sat at a booth that was wet after being wiped down. I screamed in excitement when I seen that the condiments on the table included a bottle of Tapatio hot sauce. This distraction made me forget about the wet table. About 10 minutes later, our food arrived.  French Toast Combo: The french toast was served with a gallop of butter on top and 2 packets of warmed maple syrup on the side. It was comparable to other diner quality french toast but far better than any fast food version. The eggs were cooked just right and were REAL scrambled eggs, not that weird fake patty thing. I handed the two strips of bacon over to my husband who declared they were made \"just how he liked them\". I might add that my breakfast was served on a real plate with actual (not plastic) utensils.    Sausage Breakfast Burrito: Big enough to leave you feeling stuffed and apparently tasted great. It comes with eggs, hash browns, sausage, and salsa. The Mr. stated he would forgo the salsa the next time around. Both dishes were garnished with a cute little orange slice.    Another reason why I'm hopped up on Farmer Boys is that they offer a veggie burger, which I'll definitely try the next time around. I was really surprised at the quality of the food. I was expecting more McDonald's-esque food, but it was anything but."}
{"text":"My second time, actually my third time, my very first time was through the drive-thru my hamburger was cold and wasn't asked if I wanted any tomato or lettuce and the second time I came in the man behind the counter was very professional asked if I wanted lettuce or tomato told me the whole scoop on the menu and had a pleasant experience my third time not so much I was asked what I wanted and I said the natural cheeseburger combo with onion rings and zucchini,  I was not asked if I wanted lettuce or tomato, And the people behind the counter were all joking and having a good time not really concerned with their customers was just and having a good time.  for $10.27 I expect to be asked if I want lettuce and tomato on my burger (I was not asked) I really like the concept of this restaurant but if the service doesn't get better I will never come back! Service makes a Business, if you don't take care of your customers they don't want to come back! They are your pay check!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is great. I love  this type of restaurants their very active and there is a floor person asking if we needed more coffee or water. Can't say the same about the food; I was expecting the food to amazing like people quoted the food to be. Guess they might have over sold this place.  My review on the food: Carl's Jr has better food.  This is like the expensive version of fast food  They have a bell to let everyone know that they enjoyed ... I thought I was at long John silver for a second. Customer service  is great. But I don't see my self returning here any time soon. And I really hope they don't open this joint where I live."}
{"text":"If you're traveling, super hungry and there's no restaurant around for miles except for Farmer Boys, this would be the place to go. But if you're looking to be impressed with fresh, hot food along with flavor and aroma, keep going!   Once inside this place, it smelled of stale, cold french fries and trash. The service was fine, but the food was cold. My boss loves this place - we get along, but we're total opposites with everything. Take my advice though, skip this place and keep going!"}
{"text":"Worst wait ever.   17 minute wait in drive thru for 2  burgers and a fry.   Person in front of me had over $100 order and instead of asking them to pullover to the side and wait and keep the rest of us moving they just had us all wait til their food we done. When I mentioned it to the gal at the window she shrugged it off saying I just do it that way."}
{"text":"LOVE Farmer Boys!!!  Always Fresh & Delicious!  Great Service!!! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys serves up some good tasting burgers and fries at this Las Vegas location. The food was freshly prepared and the restaurant itself was clean and well-maintained inside. Service was friendly and efficient. It's nice to see a chain restaurant that actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"Went this morning for breakfast when I received my breakfast eggs were semi warm bread hard missing part of breakfast. This has happen before at this location will never go back don't need to get sick. I noticed the franchise ones never have a problem just corporate run."}
{"text":"Customer service deserves 5 stars, however I ordered and paid for fish and chips, after about 5 minutes I was told they were out of fish. I changed my order to zucchini, an omelet and sourdough toast, out of sourdough bread. I took the order to go. When I gor home I discovered that I got french fries instead of zucchini. All in all, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great salads! Great customer service! The BBQ chicken salad is delicious and the ranch was made in house! Also probably the best restaurant in the area of Nellis...."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious. I had some burger ordered for me since i hadnt arrived yet. It had Guacamole and Bacon on it, and i had a side of onion rings with a Strawberry Shake. Ohhh man i had it for lunch and was full for a while. The Customer Service was great. And i didnt have any dessert because i was stuffed but i shall be back. Only Regret NOT GOING IN SOONER."}
{"text":"What a surprise to find a burger chain with a different attitude! This place serves up friendly service and great burgers, all at an affordable price. If you are coming for lunch, please make sure you budget some extra time, as this place can get packed.  There are certainly many choices when visiting this place and, although burgers are certainly my favorite, they have a great selection of salads, wraps, fish, soups, grilled chicken sandwiches, sides, etc. During my last visit I tried the farmer's burger with fries and a side of ranch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the ingredients, the taste profile of the burger itself, and how great my burger was presented on the plate. You certainly cannot beat a great meal, with a homemade taste, for about $10.  I hope you like it!"}
{"text":"You know my first experience was fantastic, guess I should of written a review then..would of been 5 stars. Have been back twice since the..Dinner and breakfast. Agreed this is kinda diner like, combined with a feeling of fast food. You give the order, get a number. Server brings you your order. I guess it's kind of hit/miss as far as food quality and service.Depends on who's cooking I guess.Had high hopes for my breakfast meal..ordered Famers Omlet, basically everything growing in the field and from the dairy....Was a failure..served barely warm, huge chunks of peppers,onions, stuffed with hash browns and cheese...got the feeling cook had no clue how to cook an omlet. Brought to the attention of the on duty mgr...got an I'm so sorry..stated cook must of been backed up with other orders..that was it. So on that note don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their burgers and fries are wonderful! My favorite part is the ranch dressing. The service is always great and the food is always made to order. I would go here for lunch everyday if I could. They also have great daily specials."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. We ordered 2 Farmers Burgers and 1 Big cheese. All burgers were cold to the point the cheese was still hard on top of them. We sent them back and the second time around they were pretty much the same but we were hungry and ignored it.  The interesting thing is that they say the food is made to order, well that is kind of hard when your food comes out 3 minutes after you ordered it, and the remake even faster than that. All in all really bad experience except the smiley kids at the counter"}
{"text":"Their broccoli bread bowl is delicious and so is their strawberry shake. Their farmer burger was good and so was their club sandwich. I always ring the bell as I walk out because in terms of food and service I havent had a bad experience thus far. I dont care for their fried zucchini. Its bland and its basically non seasoned raw zucchini dipped in batter and lightly fried. I would like to try their chili bread bowl and onion rings next time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see such low ratings. I thought the service and food was good. I got the French Toast Combo"}
{"text":"Meat was tough, service was good, Bun was nice. Nothing special."}
{"text":"They never fail to slightly mess up my order. Their food is good but I wish I didn't have to make two trips to pick up my correct order every time. Lesson learned ! CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE U DRIVE AWAY!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a fast food restaurant. If you are planning on doing drive-thru & there are other cars...be ready to wait a LONG time. Longest I waited was 30 minutes."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR TO GO ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE! Husband grabbed a togo order. I went for the natural no cheese and no sauce. He got it home and it had both. He went back, got the right burger but i think its been sitting for a long time! Stale, cold tasteless burger and a crumbling bun. They threw in fries which was nice however those weren't even good! Perhaps farmers boy food isn't meant to go. Ive ate at other locations, at the restaurant & to go, and it was good. This location, not so much! Wouldn't go back to the tropical location for anything else. Anytime soon..expensive for poor quality."}
{"text":"Took 25 minutes to get 2 salads and a chili bowl! Restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full at 7:45 Sunday night! Ridiculous! When the server brought out the 2 salads, she initially asked who got the one with cheese. My husband noted it was his. Then she asked who got the salad without cheese. Hello, there were only two of us! Here's your sign! This used to be hopping with plenty of help, lots of smiles and service, and a happy place. While we were there someone rang the bell and no worker even responded! Very different from how it used to be! Only reason I gave 2 stars is because their Cobb salads are good. Not worth waiting 25 minutes for, tho."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain-get over it. The food is always hot and I like the fact my food is brought to my table instead of hanging out and waiting for my # to be called. I also like how they have the calories for each of their items posted on the big board. Makes healthy decisions easier to make. Most of their combos are over 1000 calories so choose wisely. Oh, and just because it says salad, doesn't mean it's low calorie."}
{"text":"I like to go here for the variety I also love there any rings and their fried zucchini great are usually get the barn burner burger"}
{"text":"3 of us staying at fairfield inn las vegas south it was a quick easy ride over to farmers.  We ordered two yelp special combos and a sunday special club sand, which was like getting two because it was on chiabatta and each of my grown daughter and I ate half. It was good. I really liked how with combos you choose your side from fries, zuccini, green salad, or onion rings.  I had salad and it was a,good choice and their ranch dressing was tasty.  They also had little cups of jalapenos which I put in my sand.  They had those yellow peppers too. They are next to the soda machine   I was so excited they had cherry coke in the sodas.  Yes coke products!!!  Service was quick and the food was good and you order at the counter so no tipping needed.  I would gladly go back again.  They serve breakfast anytime.   Yummy!"}
{"text":"At first I was really excited about farmer boys but it wore off. I like their food which is really fresh but for some reason they can't stop burning my toast and hash browns. I've asked them on about three occasions and still nothing. When your paying your money for food- it should be right. You can burn your own food at home. Their southwestern chicken salad is so good though. Their coupons are mostly worthless and you're still going to wind up spending mostly the same amount of money. They have their app but they never ask if you're using it and I always forget so there's that."}
{"text":"Chicken club sandwich, grilled chicken breast, avocado, provolone cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and honey Dijon. It was fresh, the chicken moist, and the bacon crispy.  I love this sandwich.  Good service, clean, prices a little high but consistence is the difference."}
{"text":"I like their fresh and clean menu but their restaurant is one of the dirtiest I have ever seen. The bathroom was really dirty, dusty, and it didn't even have soap. You toil wonder how their employees wash their hands after going to the restroom. We ordered one meal and a burger and it came out to $23 dollars. It was very pricy but my burger was not good. The meat tasted dry and weird. The fries were mushy and oily, they were not crispy or seemed fresh at all. I was very disappointed since I was told that this place was good. I hate paying for overpriced bad food with unsanitary practice."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  I expected a little burger joint and was surprised by the fresh ingredients and pleasurable service."}
{"text":"one location on Decatur and Charleston has specials $4.99 breakfast this one Location doesn't!!! Shame!!! Hmmm, menu is picture perfect, love to see what Iam ordering, the zucchini sticks are to die for, yum!!! The breakfast was okay nothing special. :) Diffently a go back"}
{"text":"Love Farmer Boys and go out of my way to find them whenever possible.  Lots of choices and when dieting its nice to have options not followed by \"that will be an additional charge.\"  This morning it was 3 egg breakfast with tomato slices and sausage; dropped the hashbrowns and toast, and coffee.    Check out the Boys!"}
{"text":"Big Fan of Farmer Boys ... Like the concept of fresh food, fast and high quality at a great value ... I expect it everytime and I'm disappointed when it doesn't happen.  Not this night .... These folks were spot on from the welcoming the minute we made eye contact to the check back after the food was delivered.    Food was hot, burgers were juicy, tomatos and lettuce were cold and condiments were in perfect proportion.   Zucchini and onion rings were increditable.    The restaurant was spotless.  Keep up the great work!  Coming back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place, the food is good, friendly employees and the atmosphere reminded me a lot of Kenny Rogers roasters."}
{"text":"So, this was my first time. I've been wanting to try them for awhile, since I always drive by, and I finally did. It was delicious. And, it was all surprisingly not drenched in grease. I had the 3 egg breakfast and it was so good. They also serve a big portion, so if you're a light eater, you can definitely share a plate. The service was friendly. I had a pleasant experience. I will be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm updating my review. I've had way too many negative experiences in the last month to stay quiet. Tonight, I went through the drive-thru and got a cheeseburger meal for my kid. When I got home, I saw that not only did they forget to put cheese on it, but the meat was cold. So disappointed. I won't come on here to complain about long wait times or issues with employees like other people do - I just want my food to be correct and taste good. I've been a fan of the Eastern location for years and was happy that this Farmer Boys opened near me but my food has been wrong and not up to par the last few times that I will not be returning. Tonight's experience sealed the deal  for me. My check # for reference is 179573-1 Order #478 December 21, 2017."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today -Mother's Day- good service, good food, but it's always a struggle to get decaf coffee, and forget about refills you have to hunt them down...that's when they are available. Other than that alls good."}
{"text":"This is the second time I visited this restaurant. The first time I bought a burger but didn't taste too good so I thought I'd give it a second try. I walked in there with one other person and looked at the menu. I waited for about five minutes while the cashier and cooks all stared at me. I took my wallet out in attempt to let them know I would like to order some food from establishment. Cashier that would have taken my order continue to count her cash as the cooks continued to stare at nine. I then placed my wallet back in my rear pocket and did an about face. I exited the restaurant with no problem. Nobody tried to stop me and ask me, hey would you like to order some food? As I stated before this was my second visit to this restaurant, it will also be my last. I also feel like I was racially profiled."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I visited Farmers Boys because they do not exist on the East coast (Maryland) and for that matter we could not find a Charbroiled burger anywhere and man it was good. Farmer Boys has always been consistent and good with their menu items and the service is second to none making this place a must go for the whole family. I have tried most of the items on the menu and I don't think I've had a bad dish ever. Good place"}
{"text":"Hmmm, this one is difficult, parts impressed, parts just fell flat, descent burger, not so good fries, not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I kinda grew up with Farmers Boys down in the IE of SoCal. I love the Farmers Burger with some extra Avocado. The Fried Zucchini Sticks are a meal in themselves and delicious. And the only place to get a decent breakfast burrito. Hugh portions, down home cooking and delicious. Was extremely happy to see that they are slowly expanding into the Las Vegas Valley. The only draw back (most of the FB in SoCal have plenty of semi parking, none here) is the parking, it is in a tight crowded area and difficult to see from Craig, you could miss it if you dont know where exactly it is at."}
{"text":"As a Farmer Boys fan, I wasn't as impressed with this location compared to the North LV location and others Ive been to in SoCal. The bacon was burnt and the coffee tasted watered down (might of slipped me a decaf, IDK). Drive Thru was quick, efficient & friendly. Not a terribly bad experience, food was definately better then McD or Booger King."}
{"text":"I had the natural avacado  witt bacon cheeseburger...it was delicious and fresh also had a strawberry  shake handmade.... yummy. SO GOOD I AM GETTING MY HUBBY THE 4 PIECE FISH DINNER... Definitely coming BACK!!!!  The 4 piece fish dinner was very heavy and greasy  we are taking it back for a refund!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and open late. Food came out fast for five people. The place is clean. The menu has a small breakfast section but, it manly consists of burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Was browsing the new business list and saw this place was close by so I just had to try it. We arrive and can see lots of cars in the parking lot so we weren't the only ones excited to eat. The run down is you walk in order and they bring it to you. It has an open kitchen which is always cool to watch them cooking. They do breakfast, burgers, chicken sandwiches and wraps. Some say it's a little pricey but I'll pay a little more for better tasting food.   Now the food. I had the cobb salad wrap.It had chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, ranch and a tomato tortilla. It was awesome. I got the meal so it came with fries which were cooked just right. The employees are extremely friendly. When I experience their breakfast I hope to bump it up a star.  Keep it up guys you have a new fan."}
{"text":"We were in the drive thru for 20 minutes . To later find out they didn't put our fries. They also forgot to put the right drink. But since I was in a rush I had to go without checking, so do not come here unless you're going to want to wait 20minutes and have to correct your order."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great. And so are the prices! Wish they were open late though!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I was not impressed. The only reason I did go was because of a coupon I received in the mail for a wrap and bowl of fruit for $6.99. I went thru the drive thru and stated I had a coupon for the items stated. I placed my order and drove to the window to pay. I handed my coupon and my card to the cashier and he swiped my card and handed it back to me and then handed me my food and drove off. When I returned to my office and opened my bag for the food, I saw my receipt and it shows I paid full price for the items! About $10.80. The cashier did not apply the coupon! I should've only paid close to $7.50 for my order since I had a coupon! How annoying! The food quality and service was not worth what I paid for. =("}
{"text":"I have got the kids meal for my child that young lady didn't ask if I wanted wheat, rye or sourdough on the bread and the bread and the sandwich look like a regular sandwich I could of made at home customer service is not good here maybe because of the location"}
{"text":"This place is great when you want better than fast food, something that has a bit more quality to it but not a full service restaurant. The burgers are great, I really like those a lot. My wife has had the salads there a couple tomes plus a few other things. So far everything has been really really good. I've not ordered breakfast yet but from what I've seen it looks good too."}
{"text":"Horrible service! If I could give this place no stars I would. Dine in wait time to order was 15+ minutes to begin with. I was told that I needed to download an app to recieve an instant $5 off my bill; so I did. After the download I was told that I can't use the app discount until I earn 60 app credits, plus it expires within 2 hours of the download. With my order I requested water to drink and was given a sippy cup to drink tap water from the soda dispenser but paid for bottled water...disgusting! I finally find a clean table for seating and there's a staff member seated at a table across from us (seating for 4) with 4 plates of food eating from all plates; with guests waiting for seating. A sad display of gluttony. Then in walks a lady with a dog roaming around people dining and climbing on chairs. I ask the gentleman behind the counter to speak to a manager he states that he would send her over. After another 15 minute wait I walk back to the counter; as he sees me coming he then tells the manager that I requested to speak with her. She apologized that he just spoke to her 5 seconds before I did. I explained the issues and requested to change my order from dine-in to to-go.   Other than the manager the staff here needs retraining on customer service and satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Why oh why? Why is it so hard to get hot freshly fried french fries?  This place is weird. The decor makes you wish for a chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and creamy gravy, instead you get a cold $10 hamburger.  It was not busy at all so I don't know why our order was cold.  Since the fries didn't have any salt the salt I added did not stick to them, blah.  The use their own watered down ketchup. Which we had to get from another table, that and napkins. Will not be back.  Cashier was nice and I used a combo deal from yelp so it wasn't a total loss."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food is good. only 3 stars because they STILL cannot get an order right. EVERY.SINGLE.TIME!!"}
{"text":"You know the Cheers theme song where \"everyone knows your name?\" A server named Roxie definitely knew always knew my name and my order.  I thought maybe because I come here a little too often on my lunch break from work, but you can tell she knows a lot of her customers names and order.    Overall customer service here has improved greatly and everyone is friendly and attentive as soon as you walk through the door.      If I'm craving breakfast food, I order their skillets and if I want typical lunch food, I normally order the BBQ ranch chicken salad.  Be aware, the salad bowls are huge and enough for 2 to share. Their ranch is made daily and addicting !   As for the food, lots and lots of breakfast and lunch option.   Be sure to check out their daily specials. I would also recommend downloading their app so you can get rewards and points for dining here"}
{"text":"It was ridiculous.. I waited 35 mins for a BLT. I actually liked this place had recommended it to a lot of family members. After today, I'm never going back. C'mon a BLT, there's no hamburger to fry. The bacon was cold."}
{"text":"Really good chili cheese fries! Ranch is good as well. Zucchini sticks are quite a bit larger than I like but okay. Their customer service is absolutely amazing! I would absolutely recommend them to a friend or two! Haha"}
{"text":"This new location opened recently, last night we ran into some hiccups but I'd be willing to try again in a few months.   Farmer boys is a casual fast food place where you place your order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.   Upon arrival we were greeted warmly, salads were listed but only one salad had a description so we had to ask what was on each salad. We ordered the Cobb and the southwest as well as two sofas, however when I glanced at the soda machine I saw all of the Pepsi was out including Diet Pepsi but she told us they had Diet Pepsi behind the counter and she would bring this out to us.   The sodas came out and they were a light Amber color, looked pretty watery. They tasted like water with a little sweetener in it. Water would have been better but I figured it wasn't a big deal, they are new and ran out of Pepsi syrup.   Then our server came to tell me they ran out of avocado for the Cobb salad, I said that's okay because what else could I do? And we were extremely hungry after our workout so I just wanted to eat! I was surprised she didn't offer a discount or something extra to compensate.   When our salads came my husband wasn't pleased his corn was extremely oily, on a salad I wouldn't expect greasy corn but that's how it comes so he just ate it. However the black beans were missing. A few bites in he asked me if he made this up or they were supposed to be in there. With the sodas, the missing avocado and now the black beans I decided to get up and ask about it.   I asked the manager about the soda and the black beans at the counter. He said they were out of Pepsi to which I asked for my money back. He said yes no problem then left to ask about the black beans. He came back a while later and told me they were out of black beans. He proceeded to tell the cashiers they were out and refunded me for the salad and the sodas.  We went back to eating and the manager started making rounds to the tables and asked us if we were doing okay. I appreciate this especially at a casual fast food restaurant. Although our food lacked some of the items and they were out of soda he did try to make up for it. It's a new location and I can appreciate the service. While it wasn't the best experience I would be willing to try this location again and update my review."}
{"text":"This Southern California chain has been expanding into Vegas and we had dinner at the Rainbow Blvd location recently.  They are a more upscale fast food place like Five Guys or In n Out but they have a ton more things on the menu.  Everything for breakfast stuff, to burgers to sandwiches to salads to chicken strips.  A little bit of everything.  Mom had the pastrami sandwich on a ciabatta roll.  She really like it.  Lots of tasty meat in a soft bun.  The fries were pretty good but not as good as Five Guys.  My uncle had a double burger with onion rings.  He really enjoyed his.  I had the regular burger with onion rings.  The burger was nicely cooked and had good toppings.  The onions were very big but tasty.  Nice cornmeal crust.  Ranch dressing on the side.    The soda machine had lots of options and I had a zero calorie Zero water with berries.  Nice option if you don't want soda.  The staff seemed to be new so they were a bit unsure what they were doing but overall we had good service and good food.  I will try it again."}
{"text":"Think there was only the one employee working at 10:30 Monday morning(no exaggeration necessary!) 20 minutes waiting in the drive thru for a breakfast burrito that costs almost $8. Uncooked potatoes inside overcooked scrambled eggs.  Was not impressed by Farmerboys."}
{"text":"I'm huge on customer service and Mesadies was very sweet and patient knowing that it was my first time here."}
{"text":"Line is ALWAYS BACKED UP IN THE DRIVE THRU FOOD TAKES EXTREMELY LONG TO GET. Food is pretty good when i get it right. Which is 5/10 times so 50/50 chance. Employees are pretty lazy for the most part there's about 2 people that work hard and fast while the rest seem to just be lazy and do things that don't seem productive... care in today 6 cars in the drive thru came in to get faster service 10 min later no food still 1 person helping drive thru and walk in customers 1 cook and 2 people bagging small bags of cheese..... 3 people just standing around look like they are on break or leaving or just hanging out.... unprofessional i like the food even tho i shouldn't be eating fast food this is well not fast food.."}
{"text":"Revised review at Yelp and Farmerboys request:  This review is regarding a personal experience I had with an incorrect order and the subsequent lack of \"management\" etiquette about said order.  I waited in the drive through for close to 10 minutes, got my food and drove off as normal, but I stopped after realizing I was missing part of my order. I was upset after waiting so long, why did they forget my drink? I drove back to the resteraunt and was given a blank expression from the supervisor(?) after being ignored for a solid minute.   I got the rest of my order with zero apologies. I drove home and opened the rest of my meal, only to discover it was the wrong burger. This place used to be good, like 10-12 months ago.  But its clear that order accuracy and customer relations are not this location's strong suit, in my case. My food poisoning did occur from this location in the recent past, but I still chose to give the place another shot.  Shame on me for that. The rest of review removed at Yelp/Farmerboys request for alluding legal action against me.  Update 03-29-16 Here's the reply I received from their corporate after explaining the situation in complete detail along with all of my contact information asking for a refund of the money that I paid for two meals equaling $40.  \"Hi Mike, your feedback helps us see where improvements are needed. We apologize for the unsatisfactory experience you recently had at our location in Las Vegas, we'll address this issue immediately with the restaurant's team. Additionally, if you would like to speak with someone from our restaurant management team, please call our corporate office at (951) 275-9900 and provide us with your contact information. We'll make sure the appropriate person reaches out to you.\"  They had somebody that did not speak English as their primary language contact me I unfortunately could not understand her as she sounded like she was speaking with a mouth full of marbles.  Then she proceeded to call me by several different names instead of my actual name and asked that I restate every single thing I had already conveyed to the corporate office prior.  This made me furious as a customer and I ended the call.    Update 03-30-16  I've received an email regarding complaints from Yelp/Farmerboys to Help regarding my review, asking me to modify or remove the negative review altogether.  Since I thought this was America and we have freedom of speech, apparently not, according to Yelp's subtle legal action threatening email.  So I've modified my review to be more \"P.C.\" and to meet their \"Terms and Conditions.\" I'm no longer interested in participating in this biased website, so I'm out."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast this year!  Well, I made it just over 5 months writing positive reviews.  Although I was not expecting much going to a fast food restaurant, I did expect better...... A lot better.  I walked in and was greeted cordially.  I was 95% through my order and was handing the cashier my money when she raised her finger to me and said, \"Wait a minute, sir.\"  She quickly went to another register and took someones order who had walked in after I did.  I could not believe it.  When she came back, I asked her why she did what she did.  To tell you the truth, I did not understand what she was trying to say to me.  She then asked what I wanted to order.  I thought, \"Again, I have to tell you?\"  I gave her my simple order, \"Three egg breakfast with hashbrowns and toast.  No drink just water.\" I paid, took my number ans waited.  When I received my meal I soon realized that they do not cook the bottom of the hashbrown potatoes.  Also, the bread was so cold that the butter didn't melt........and when i say butter, there was a lot of it. The eggs were fine but the remainder of the meal was fit for the garbage.  When I brought the problems up to my server she said sorry and walked away.  Sorry Farmer Boys.  I will not be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I always try most of the new places that specialize in breakfast. I love breakfast! I tried the S Eastern location. Really poor service; slow. Two very small eggs, processed ham, tomatoe slices that we NOT ripe,  cold toast (the butter wouldn't melt) and average coffee....$9.89. I won't go back and would say for you not to either. There are too many places in the Las Vegas area that serve a very good bfast for much much less."}
{"text":"I swear everything I've eaten from here tastes delish!! I especially love.. Love their orange juice!"}
{"text":"I recently had a burger and zucchini sticks here for lunch a couple weeks back.  I really liked the zuchini sticks with ranch dressing.  Otherwise, I hate the decor and it seems like a fast food joint trying to be a restaurant.  I would give it an okay as I would have to try other menu items to determine if it would overide my hate for the rooster."}
{"text":"The Farmer's Burger is delicious! Chili Cheese Fries hit the spot, there is nothing in town that compares to them. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Consistent good food for a burger joint.  The food is fresh made and tasty.   They also do breakfast but I have never tried it.    The pastrami sandwich is above average.  The fish basket is plentiful and quite good.  Make sure you download the Farmer Boys app for some free stuff."}
{"text":"Good hamburger joint with a few surprises like Fish and Chips.  The counter is a bit disjointed but the servers get the job done.   The burgers are huge and pretty tasty.  The fries are really good when they are hot.     This place is not In-And-Out but does a respectable job on a burger."}
{"text":"Good quality food, but overpriced. A burger combo plus a drink can cost you over $13, which is hard to justify for a glorified fast food restaurant. $3 for a medium sized side of fries is insulting. No gracias!  We used to frequent Farmer Boys when they first opened in Vegas 10 years ago, but their prices have increased dramatically since then. On the plus side they have a new app that will give you $5 back for every $60 spent."}
{"text":"I used to go to this farmer boys all the time I went today and got home which I'm 15 mins away and my order was wrong I thought ok no big deal this is a big company let me call them and they'll fix it. Instead I get a manager by the name of Andres who had a really thick accent I'm not sure if he even understood me but he pretty much told me to file a complaint and have a good day. I used to go to this farmer boys a lot I was actually here 2 days ago and I always spend around $20 but I will no longer be going he didn't even try to fix the issue I was so surprised for a burger spot that isn't cheap like mc Donald's u would think they would care more."}
{"text":"Horrible service soon as I got there i can tell the bad service, under trained employees menu on the board wasn't even right lady in front of me left cus they had the price wrong on the chicken wrap didn't even honor it for her then the lady next to me kept telling the cashier her food been sitting there for a while, and the cashier still made her wait wow. Then when I order i asked for a chicken sandwich but instead of grilled chicken I wanted fried chicken as I always order it. When I paid i told the cashier I was scared to even order from what I seen but went ahead and ordered cus I love there food. So as I'm sitting waiting for my food hoping nothing else goes wrong, the cashier comes up to me and tells me that she forgot to charge for the crispy chicken wow really so I go back to pay for it and I tell the manager what's going on with the service why so many screw ups and she gets a attitude with me and says don't worry about it I'll pay for it and walks away all mad wow again. So I go and sit down feeling bad cus this lady is mad cus she has to pay for the crispy chicken like i really needed  her to pay for it wasenent even a worry about that just the service. As we're waiting for the food the guest that were in line behind  us get there food first, Me and my wife had it there is no way we're eating there ever again after that were DONE  with that farmers boys"}
{"text":"Corporate Farmer Boys. Brings down the price for your average meal by a dollar or two. Great Centennial Hills location.  Great Friendly srrvice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is long over due. It's fresh made and the breakfast you just need to have sometimes. Their salads are huge and the price won't kill you. They do \"farm to table\" which is important to me. There are two ladies that make customer service a pleasure at this location ( I wish I knew their names).Love their zucchini strips, a \"must\" have! Ring the bell as you leave to let then know they are doing it well!!"}
{"text":"My husband used to love going to Farmer Boys on the weekends for breakfast. The chicken gravy bowl was spectacular! Service here is hit and miss. They really do try, but sometimes severely understaffed.   Recently we went for dinner, your regular fast-food fare. Hubby ordered a burger, kids got chicken fingers and fries, and I ordered some soup. It took over 40 minutes for is to receive our food, and I did not receive my soup (they said it was \"on the way\"). So I waited.......... And waited......... And waited......  30 minutes after everyone else in my family FINISHED THEIR DINNER I walked to the front counter, asking for my soup. The girl gave me a blank state and said \"You're still here?\" I asked for a refund, and she urgently went to the back office. I did not see her again for close to 10 minutes (still standing at the counter).   I promptly went to my table, gathered my things and my children, and left the Restaraunt. Not only did I receive HORRIBLE customer service, I did not receive the food I paid for, and I did not receive a refund. I will not be back. Ever."}
{"text":"No sure what everyone is complaining about. This place is clean, staff is friendly, price is fair, and food is bomb. Love this place"}
{"text":"While I have always liked farmer boys, I have noticed recently that many of the items they advertise do not look like the item you actually receive. It is time for consumers to stand up to restaurants and demand that the item ordered looks like the item they receive. Case in point is the recently advertised double chili cheeseburger.  The Add Looks Great Lots Of Chili On The Top And Bottom Of The Sandwich With Some Pickle And DICED onion. The First Time I Ordered This You Could Barely Find The Chili And A Cook Who Was Seated IN The dining Room Said Yes It Only Has 1 Ounce Of Chili On it.  I took a pic of both the ad and the burger and sent an email to corporate. They answered they will advise the store. I ordered this burger again Sunday and received the same sad looking chili burger, when the server brought it I said where is the chili?? She did not know what to say, I said please take it back to the kitchen and bring me a burger that looks like the picture.  She returned with a nice chili burger. I have decided to start telling the waitress at any restaurant I go to, to prepare my food as pictured."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time this week. The food was okay but the manager dude was kind of rude. He sent the cashier off to do something else in the middle of our ordering transaction, flipped my change back at me, and abruptly sent us on our way.  The other employees were courteous and friendly. Hope that manager dude was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"I went to the new location on Stephanie and it was awesome!  Alex was an employee that really stood out, very helpful and informed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. It's really good food. Don't let the drive thru fool you, i got a full breakfast that was just as good if no better then any diner. My husband loved his burger and said \"very yummy\", he's a man of very few words so saying that is big. It really nice to be able to go some where that gives you a large selection.   For your first time don't go in the drive thru because you will be there forever looking at the menu and deciding what you want.  The only reason its a 4 star was its a little pricey but really worth it."}
{"text":"I mean....22 dollars for two burgers and fries...which honestly was strangely similar in flavor to BK burgers.  Couple that with soggy unsalted fries and an order which we waited 5min for and was wrong...I cant think of anything that would compel me to ever come back."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed by Farmer Boys! This was my first time eating there, and I wasn't sure what to expect. And I am always wary of taking my 1 year old to any fast food place, but I wasn't disappointed.   I wish more places offered breakfast options (made fresh) like this place does. It gave us so many more options and allowed my Husband and I to have Cobb Salads while our daughter had an egg breakfast (which she loved).   The service was super friendly and she even gave us a discount on our order. We did have to wait a little while for our food, but I am fine with that, knowing that it was made to order and not sitting in some warming tray waiting for us. The salads were larger than I expected and really well made and I would definitely order it again.   This location isn't really near me, so I am not sure when I'll be back, but if I am in the area and looking for food, I'm down!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted. Told them we had never ate here before, and they totally helped us figure out the menu and offered us exactly what we wanted! The first thing they told me sounded perfect so that's what I got. My wife saw something and the lady described it making it sound so good and my wife decided to get that.   Such a great first experience, awesome customer service and the food is so good!   We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here. The Natural Burger was good but everything else was gross. The customer service was average at best.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to love this location but I am tired of asking for something and getting home to find out I didn't get it.   I am also super sick of people who answer their phones with absolutely Zero customer service.   If I order a natural avocado burger and get home with a patty bread and cheese with diced onions and pickles I'm gonna be angry.   Yea you guys are super sweet but you are also 1. not great listeners I repeated that particular order 3 times. He repeated to back to me yet my receipt says something different and I DID NOT GET WHAT I WANTED.   The guy answering the phone made the situation worse by not be empathetic and not problem solving the situation.  Don't go and Fk up my order and talk to me like I made some mistake.   Clean your ears out and get peoples orders correct. I pay money to not stress about your teams incompetence.   I will be calling this GM tomorrow and giving them a hell of a mouthful. I'm sick of the mediocre service in this town. I honestly want to take this disgusting burger and throw it in their face"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. I could literally eat the Chopped Cobb salad everyday and be happy. Staff is attentive and efficient. Sometimes the drive through takes a long time because they make everything fresh. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Mehhhhh. I would personally never return but that's just my take.   I've heard their fried zucchini is good and was craving a strawberry shake so we decided to try this place on the way to Gilcrease Orchard.   This was my first visit to Farmer Boys. I didn't realize the inside was like full restaurant style and they had so many options including breakfast. The place was packed so I was assuming it was going to be delicious.   I ordered onion rings and a side salad and of course the shake I went there for in the first place. My husband had a burger and fries.   We sat outside which was nice except that the drive thru wraps around the patio and you can enjoy the smell of exhaust while you eat :) My shake was delicious and no complaints there. The onion rings were really bland even with like 5 side of ranch. The order is big and the actual onion rings are huge but the flavor was lacking. My side salad was literally lettuce with chopped tomatoes. My husband's burger was greasy and sitting in the sauce and the cheese was hard and not melted. The combo for a burger and fries with drink is like 9.50 and for that price might as well go to like Red Robin.   So basically I would never return although my husband said he has had better experiences there and the breakfast burrito is good. He can go on his own next time ;)"}
{"text":"Love the fried zucchini! Yumma...Food is fresh and made to order don't go if you only have 'drive-thru' time. This spot is better if you order inside. I always take mine to go, but I haven't always had luck with the drive-thru. I'd classify Farmer Boys as high end fast food."}
{"text":"I LOVE Farmer Boys!!! It's one of the few fast food restaurants that actually uses real, fresh ingredients and cooks food to order! The BBQ Ranch chicken salad is amazing, the ranch is made fresh on site, and the zucchini sticks are amazing! Also.... they have a military discount ."}
{"text":"I love the food. They serve quickly being a freshly cooked restaurant. The employees make you feel welcomed. Or at least good at faking it. Haha. I can come here expecting to leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"Usually the breakfast here is pretty good, so we decided to come by for dinner tonight. So dissapointed. I got the Chicken BBQ wrap, which contained so much bacon I wanted to throw up, and zero BBQ sauce? Um okay. I had to go up to the front to return it. Nowhere on the menu did it say bacon was on it, and truth be told I wouldn't have minded if it wasnt the entirety of the wrap. GROSS. I ordered a burger, which was also not tasty. It was hard and thin, and full of chopped onion that were placed under the patty? How weird. They messed up my boyfriends plain burger, which wasn't a problem because my boyfriend took two bites of the remade one and said \"I'm done\". Even the raspberry tea from the machine didn't taste right. Three stars for cleanliness and polite staff."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's always delicious and fulfilling. The staff is always friendly and courteous. The only problem I ever have is that sometimes the wait can be long for your food. They do, however, make the burgers to order so it's fresh and that's why the wait times can be higher than going to burger king or other fast food joints."}
{"text":"We were hungry (given the time change) and were thrilled to find this place was open. Everyone agreed that the food was quite good. I had the breakfast sandwich, which was fantastic. That is saying a lot, since I am not a big breakfast person!  Everything was very well priced for the area. You definitely get a good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week, if not twice, and it's always ridiculously delicious. Tiffany is always very patient with our orders and literally treats us like family. She deserves a raise, a bonus, and an extended paid vacation.. Because, as a business owner myself, I guarantee you she is a primary reason for the busy drive-thru. Always helpful, always courteous, and the order is always right. We are also grateful for the option of a hormone and antibiotic free burger, as we try to keep our diet as clean as possible. So for a fast food option, this is an optimal choice.. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really can't believe the overall rating of this restaurant. The lady and I went through the drive through last night to try a burger and fries. What we received was absolutely disgusting. To begin don't view me as a burger snob that won't eat a fast food burger because that's far from true. The burgers we received reminded me of McDonald's and I mean that in a very negative way. Burgers were extremely thin and rubbery. I believe they advertise 100% ground beef but if so they absolutely ruined this beef. After getting home and taking a few bites we fed the remainder of the burgers to our dog Paco. I've been a long time user of Yelp but never reviewed a place. This is what caused me to sign up. I would never be back. Although the staff was actually very friendly the burgers were overpriced! $10 for a burger meal compared to a Wendy's combo of like $7-8 I would pick Wendy's every single time. Will never return."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 8-8-15 through the drive-thru around 4PM.  I have lived here for 4 years and never been to Farmer Boys so I thought I'd giv'er a go.    $15.33 got me a cobb salad and an order of chili-cheese fries (don't judge me lol).  This salad was amazing...fresh leaf lettuce, huge chunks of fresh avocado, a whole boiled egg, enough bacon to choke a horse, cheese, tomatoes, and grilled chicken.  Their ranch dressing is outta this world...it's the good runny homemade kind like at wingstop.  I was so pleased with this salad.    There were a ton of people in the drive-thru but the line went quick.  I may be back here more often for their salads."}
{"text":"Went on Wednesday 10-7-15 around 5:15 PM at the drive-thru.  This location is kinda hidden behind the taco bell on Craig although technically it's on Lamb.    I've been hooked on their salads lately.  Well, actually, mostly just their ranch dressing but I can't just drink ranch dressing because I'm an adult.  So I smother things in it and since it's salad I tell myself I'm eating healthy.    Anyways...moving on...they have some great new salads.  My current favorite there is the southwest chicken salad ($8.96 after tax).  The lettuce is always cold and fresh, and the black beans, chicken, avocado, cheese, and corn are like a fiesta in my mouth.  I'm in love with this salad right now.    The drive-thru here is relatively quick and it's on my way home so it's really convenient to pick up dinner here.  I've maybe eaten 5 or 6 times here and it's good food.  *UPDATE*  I took off a star because the last three times I've been here there has been a problem.    -2/16/16- Went through the drive thru at 5:30 and asked for three containers of ranch and received none.    -2/20/16 Went through the drive-thru at 5:30 PM and was charged $17.93 instead of $12.51.  Manager had to correct it and refund my card.    -3/8/16 Went through the drive thru at 6pm and ordered a southwest chicken salad.  The avocado they put on there looked like they dug it out of a dumpster.  It was almost black.  I can't believe they served that to me!!!  Gross!!!!   Dear manager or Farmer Boys on Lamb & Craig....you might wanna take a look at your weekday evening shift workers cuz' they are messin' up a LOT."}
{"text":"Very good quality and fresh food. Their breakfast and lunch are great. Friendly service and hot food made only after you order. I'll continue to go here time after time until otherwise."}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is more of a restaurant than fast food. You order your food first kind of like Sizzler used to be. They bring your food and coffee refills to you at your table. The hard working folks here check on you constantly to make sure you have what you need. The food is pretty good. Farmer Boys has real hospitality, and Great service. The theme is very country. The Farmer Boys in North Lad Vegas has a Air force theme with planes suspended from the ceiling and lots of service men and women frequent that location."}
{"text":"After our terrible experience, a Farmer Boys official called and told my wife that they would put my name on their VIP list so we could have a free meal. I went there last night to get those free meals, and a very rude manager named Andres told me I was not on their list, and he had nothing for me. What a poorly-run restaurant."}
{"text":"The best part for me is they list the caloric content for item, right on the menu.  Makes it easy to know what you're ordering.  Their Fit Ham and Fit Turkey sandwiches are very good and low cal.  Fresh, crisp tomato and lettuce, mustard, turkey/ham, and delicious wheat bread.  Their clam chowder is very good, as well.  Skip the tortilla soup, it was watery when I had it.    Even though the menu looks (and mostly is) a fried food lover's delight, there are healthy, tasty options to be had."}
{"text":"Very clean, but it better be its brand new, the staff seams they like to be here and friendly. I ordered the natural with avocado and bacon that the man suggested. Great choice brother! Burger was juicy the avocado was creamy all to get her it fit perfectly. Had a side of fries and 2 onion rings. At first I didn't get why they give you 2 then they delivered it to my table and then I understood. They are huge. Cornmeal or something like that coating was great. I finished and someone is walking around checking on everyone and even cleaned my plate when finished. A cross between fast food and sit down. Nice touch. Only complaint is it is a little pricey but then again quality and service are there. Great job guys and I will be back. If you haven't been definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered The Barn Burner for $4.99  The Beef was juicy, the Pepper Jack Cheese was great, the Jalapeno Hot Wheels had a nice kick and Fiery Farmer's Sauce was delicious.  A nice spicy Meal from this Drive Thru."}
{"text":"Looking for a fast food place ran across Farmer Boys the breakfast burrito was awesome. We went through the drive thru brought the food back to hotel it was still hot and tasted wonderful. I would give this place 5 stars and would eat here again. We are from Michigan and loved it."}
{"text":"You really cannot go wrong at Farmer Boys everything on the menu is cooked fresh and is fantastic.  Service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"I cannot understand the negative reviews! We were met with a smile, no wait and friendly advice to the new-to-us-menu. The whole experience from food to service was above expectations. We were shocked when we finished that the GM said she was buying our meal because she wanted us to get to know them!    She's right... We will be back to this clean, happy breakfast or burgers restaurant that beats fast food and IHOP.   Thanks for unexpected 5 star service."}
{"text":"I went there today and I ordered the 4pc fish platter.  Unfortunately for them it was the worst thing I've eaten in a very long time.  I actually feel sick to my stomach now.  The fish was mushy inside of the breading.  The fries were soggy,  also I got zucchini instead of onion rings and they were slimy.  The only reason I'm not giving them one star is because the manager refunded my money.   Now I use to love this place but the quality has decreased a lot.  I don't think I will return there again."}
{"text":"I have been to other Farmer Boys locations in the past and have generally liked the food and cost. But today all I wanted was a simple egg and cheese burrito.  This is a burrito I order all over town for under $4.00. Not here. They charge you for a full breakfast burrito, some $6.38. They served it with some sort of processed American cheese, and it was awful. Too many other choices around to pay that much here for an inferior product."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after shopping to grab some food to go home with. My first glance at the menu found me searching for something interesting, which I didn't find. Eventually ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger thing and strawberry milkshake.  This was one of the worst burgers I've ever had. Virtually flavorless. The strawberry shake had fresh strawberries mixed in, but the ice cream was more like ice milk. Not creamy, also lacked any flavor.  Won't be eating here again when there are better options. Its overpriced, and not that good."}
{"text":"Not very good for the price point. Kinda rude at the window and when we needed extra sauce. Our food looked slapped together and incredibly messy. There are too many competing places to eat in Las Vegas area for the service to be this terrible and for employees to be this careless about what they serve patrons."}
{"text":"Best fried zucchini and onion rings! After ordering, the food was brought to the table quickly. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat burgers. Buy a t-shirt and you get 10% off every tuesday as long as you wear the shirt when eating. The staff is great, you get a number and they bring your food to you. It is a nice atmosphere and brings a resturant feel to a fast food joint. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I had a great experience even though our food was a little late the manager came up to us and apologized and refunded my order was super nice exceptional service and it was during lunch rush.  means alot to us and will be back,  farmer for life."}
{"text":"Had always heard good things about this place sonwas excited to try. Went thru the drive.  All three burgers where good. But not great like ive heard. They were put together sloppy. The onion rings and zucchini are large but breading pretty much falls off. Only 15 min ride home, but that seemed to be enough to make them soggy and not crisp. The frys from the kids meal and chilli cheese frys were unedible. Stale with no seasoning. The chilli was awful and made the chilli from the 7-11 seem gourmet. Really bummed out spent 37.00 and wont ever go back.  Had high hopes."}
{"text":"Foods good service is ok but when I called the manager on the dusty counter it seemed he was bothered when he replied is that what your problem is ! Just saying for. 32.00 for 2 adults and 2 toddlers the place should be a little cleaner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way out of Vegas. No lines to eat on a Sunday - brunch prime time. The food is restaurant quality food at fast food prices with a relaxed vibe. The staff here are super nice and friendly! Especially Lemar, the enthusiastic young guy we had behind the cash register.  Even though it looks like a fast food joint, service is like a full-service restaurant - they bring your food, refill your coffee and bus your table. I'd gladly come back here again!"}
{"text":"The food is great! B fast is so good if your in a hurry too. The seating and the way they decorate the room is relaxing. I really like this place."}
{"text":"Best farmer boys we've been to. We eat at their other location at least once a week, but were in the area so we stopped for dinner. We shared the sourdough chicken avocado sandwich with half onion rings and half zucchini. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our food was served half and half on separate plates. We didn't even have to ask. Again great service an great food.  There was a little too much lettuce on our sandwich though.  Happy Halloween."}
{"text":"We come here regularly. It's always busy. We get the sourdough chicken avocado sandwich. Sometimes a salad. Tastes great. Amazing for hangovers as well.  In the summer it gets really hot in here though. Recently they put up better blinds and cranked up the A/c so it can get a bit chilly especially if you didn't expect it."}
{"text":"Went thru the Drive-thru and ordered one breakfast (Denver omelet).  As i'm pulling out of the Drive-thru I check the breakfast and it's the wrong breakfast.  Now I have to park and go inside (kind of defeats the purpose of the Drive-thru).  I wait a few mins while the girl at the counter is taking someone's order, then another girl walks up with a bag in her hand (she already knows why I'm there and apologizes).  Got to work, ate the omelet, it was ok ... nothing to write home about, but at least with the tomato slices and whole wheat bread it was very healthy."}
{"text":"Everything is made to order so it's about a 10 minute wait whether you go inside or through the drive-thru but totally worth it! Two thumbs up and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Customer service in this store is really amazing!! Desiree at the drive through went above and beyond in ways I didn't expect! I'm literally shocked at how nice she was and it changed my whole morning! Great employees!! Thanks farmer boys- will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was super busy when we went in. We had never been here before.  Did not know what to order. The food was pretty good. Hamburgers were big and looked nice when it came out. We had the fries covered with the chili. Over all it was not too bad. We would probably go back sometime, For being a fast food place is was not bad."}
{"text":"I came here today and was actually surprised at the experience I had. I am usually not one to complain or return food at any establishment, I just take the loss and keep it pushing. Considering Farmer Boys is pretty pricey, I had to return my food. I came around 2pm and ordered a BLT, 4 piece chicken finger, and fries. I was in a rush because I had an appointment to get to. I get to my appointment across town and begin to eat my food. The fries weren't fully cooked, literally still crunchy as if it was a raw potato. My blt was soggy and the toast was burnt to a crisp. The fingers seemed like they were in the freezer for ages and fried way too long. I ate a few fries and a few bites of the BLT and threw away what I had but kept the rest in the bag. When I came back to that side of town around 5:30pm I went to return my food. I went back thru the drive thru and explained what was wrong very politely. The manager says rudely, \"do you have the food? If not no refund.\" I said I did have the food and went to the window. Again explained what the issue was with the food nicely and the manager, Jesus, was very rude and just kept peeking through the bag. The girl with the red short hair was very nice and she honestly should be the manager, because she handled it nicely. I then get my new order because obviously I didn't want the same thing to be disappointed again. I tell the manager I'd like the difference because my new order was cheaper. He says AND I QUOTE, \"no I won't give the refund because you ate half the food and coming back hours later and it's sketchy to me.\" Sketchy? Are you kidding me? Because I didn't come back right away I was on the other side of town. I was very disappointed with how he handled it and I will never be coming back to this establishment. I feel bad for the workers in there that have to deal with such a rude manager. Jesus you need to take a work ethic class because you don't know how to deal with customers."}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until I drove by. It was packed so I assumed it was good. I got a grilled chicken wrap, and it was ok. It wasn't amazing and it wasn't horrible. I'll probably try it again to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going to this location, the burgers a soggy and with bad taste, latter on expect upset stomach and diarrhea. Customer service is \"0\" bellow any expectations. Never again Farmers Boys burgers lesson learned the hard way."}
{"text":"Felt like a burger and fries from a boys has reasonable prices and fresh food. Zucchini chili cheese and burger. Chocolate shake and root beer  to top it all off sunshiny day!"}
{"text":"Great food great service!!! Im use to eating farmer boys in the IE and all those locations are great, came out here to Vegas and man still  GREAT!! I had the French toast combo and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My last dinner outing here was not up to snuff.  The trouble began with a rather unfriendly cashier telling me that the restaurant was totally out of Clam Chowder after I ordered same as part of a Fish Dinner, and ended with one of the hamburger patties on a Farmer's Burger arriving burnt well beyond regular charbroiling.  Fries were just okay.  But O-Rings were real big and thick, such that only a few would do.  And, a simple salad was very good, with fresh little cubes of tomato, Iceberg Lettuce, and a little cabbage.  The other elements of the Farmer's Burger--bacon, smashed avocado, cheese, pickles, tomato, and lettuce--were fine, but the scorched patty detracted greatly from the overall dining experience.  Diane enjoyed her 4 pieces of wild-caught Alaskan Pollock.      Down a rung after this flawed expedition."}
{"text":"I must say I liked his location better than the one on Decatur and Russell. The zucchini sticks were smaller but crispier. My burger cooked to perfection and the staff were so friendly! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has been getting better on giving me exactly what I order and ask lately, I remember in my last review I mentioned it was hard to get what was requested such as ranch and what not and how I would pay extra... Well that's gotten a lot better and now they are asking for ID at the window which is nice.   Had take out. These zucini sticks are a hit and miss. They are really crunchy sometimes  or  soggy the next   so I just bought an air fryer and it turned out great!!!! I wish they had a couple of those in their store. Would cut calories too!!!!"}
{"text":"Come on my real first time coming to this establishment! I thought I would get a great fast food dinner ! Nope wrong ! I ordered a patty melt ! What I got was a fast flash non cheesy burger with onions and no melted cheese !"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good portions and a good place, especially if you enjoy decorative cow pictures. I had the double bacon cheeseburger combo and was quite full. I think it's a refreshing change from the usual fast food/ sit down places."}
{"text":"Dude, I usually go to the Farmer Boy's off of Decatur by my condo but this location is close to work. On my way to a friend's house one night I was craving their fried zucchini w/ranch. I stopped by and ordered a 4 piece, and boy oh boy these things were huge. They must have ordered the Monster Magnum zucchini's. These things were cut to the size of 10' inch bozacks! I really had to work them to fit in my mouth to take a bite. This was good however at the same time quite irritating. Especially eating in my car on the move. I am at the stop light and people are staring like what the hell is this woman putting in her mouth!!!!! It was crazy, like trying to shove an old school wood baseball bat in my darn mouth.  They were tasty as always, fresh and juicy fried to perfection exploding with hot juice every bite. Let them cool off a bit, they are so long and thick that it is extremely messy.  I have been a huge fan of Farmer Boy's for a couple of years now. They never disappoint and their customer service is Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys has always remained consistent with very good food and prices. They always have savings incentives if you are signed up on their e-club in which you can get lots of freebies and discounts. They have great breakfast and lunch regardless of what you order or what time you visit. Their food portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. My only concern lately is the service, my last experience with one of the crew leaders was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the 4 piece fish fry. Fish good ,crispy fries good,2 onion rings good, dinner salad not so good. Far from fresh.  Lettuce was old and wilty.  Dressing very good. GF had the BBQ Chicken Ranch salad. Same lettuce.  Oh well I guess we have different opinions as to what fresh is."}
{"text":"It's my first time in here.  I've ordered the \"farmhand bowl\"...... Wonderful dish. The right amount of everything just waiting for a bit. Love it. I would give five stars but I've ordered a chilly bowl as well. They have a bread bowl and a regular for the chilly. Take the bread. Don't do the mistake I did. The texture of the chilly is for bread or hot dog ,not for a regular bowl. A regular chilly bowl texture is chunky and you can see the pieces NOT GROUNDED ! Over all.....Great food."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good hamburger. Hamburgers are one of my favorite things to find in restaurants , especially good ones. Definitely in my top 10 Burger faves."}
{"text":"I was Halloween shopping across the street and my GF suggested we give this place a try as \"I love them their food is so much better than a fastfood chain restaurant\" As she works for a Burger Restaurant  I was skeptical but agreed thinking I would tell on her the next time I see her boss.  Your secret is safe though I agree 100%.   The food was top notch; the service was great and she was correct it mixes in the best of a fast-food chain and a mom & pop sit down restaurant.  The menu is a bit much for them to specialize in anything but specific but my burger was done correctly and the onion rings were top notch.  It was hot so I decided to grab a Strawberry frosty/shake and it was delicious and had plenty of fruit chunks mixed throughout the cup;  (just wish they didn't get stuck in the straw)  All in all the price was a little high but for the quality of the service and the food I won't complain about it and say you get what you pay for and if you are comfortable with another chains discount/$1 menu by all means go for it but please give these guys a try; you may just start skipping those other chains and saving up to eat here."}
{"text":"Last place we ate after along weekend in Vegas.  I liked everything but the chicken sandwich I ordered.   1 it was really dry  2 the thing that made me really frustrated was size of the chicken. Are you kidding me with that small piece of chicken. It was so small I ended up moving it to the side and cut the sandwich in half so I could have all the meat on one side.  Sooo I don't recommend the chicken sandwich. Everything else was super tasty."}
{"text":"Very good as usual, staff was friendly and quick enough. Ordered the farm burger and wasnt disappointed. Definitely will be coming back when I'm fiending for a great burger."}
{"text":"It took over 20 minutes to get our food when we sat inside. The food was disgusting. I would say that I'll be sure to use the drive thru next time but I won't be returning!!!!!! I gave 1 star for customer service. Otherwise buh bye Farmers Nastiness!"}
{"text":"Expect longer wait times then your regular fast food place, they make the food fresh!"}
{"text":"I get burgers through the drive through on my work break. It's delicious and it's a lot of food! Way better than fast food and doesn't taste like fast food. It's not expensive either. The breakfast burritos and coffee are great and well priced. Check it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Zucchini was really good, burgers were awesome but the onion ribg were just ok.  Great friendly service and place was really clean. We will be back to try there breakfast. Overall good food."}
{"text":"I crave this place more than In-N-Out. I have been here multiple times and the food is always so fresh. The staff is very friendly. I always ask for a side of jalapenos and they give me a generous amount. The only complaint that I have is that the drive thru takes some time but the food is super fresh so I don't think it's bad enough to only give 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great time. Hokie and Michelle were both very helpful. The food was good and restaurant was clean and tidy. I qill definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would give you zero stars if I could.   Been here twice now.  First time they messed up my order so on my second order which they were replacing from the first visit I sat in the drive through for 35 minutes.  This is not a exaggeration either, might have been longer.   I will never ever eat at your restaurant again.   Absolutely no excuse for this level of service."}
{"text":"The burgers here were amazing! I had the double cheese burger and it was huge. I also had the fried zucchini and it was a good size portion. The zucchini was the perfect texture, but the batter was bland. It was the same for my husband's onion rings. I would suggest just having fries."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ..I love the burgers and the zucchini..it's hard to find California burgers in Vegas .."}
{"text":"As you may have noticed I have been coming here a little to often lol. With that being said. I  really appreciate quality food without the high price tag that comes with it.  Customer service is great and very on top of it. Variety of things to choose from and the soup bowl is really good especially the sour dough bread it comes in. If you are on a working class budget come check this place out  you won't break the bank and your tummy will be happy.  Xoxox"}
{"text":"Farmer Boys is a good alternative to the typical fast food in the area. I wanted a sandwich for lunch and although they are far from cheap, they have good quality food and it's as close as you can get home cooked food a a drive thru spot.   This particular location was a little speedier than others I've been to. Big fan of that since I usually avoid other Farmer Boys locations for that reason. The service was pretty standard, nothing made it stand out more than other drive thru restaurants, but it was solid.   I can't attest to the service when you dine inside, but I would probably stop here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I don't really get Farmer Boys. I've been to several locations over the years and have always been confused by the popularity of this place.  For what you get, they seem a little overpriced. If I do end up here I usually order a BLT or an omelette.   Service at this particular location was a little lackluster but they just recently opened so they seem like they are still working on getting everything organized.   I don't see myself coming here often but it's a good option for the area."}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of Farmer Boys. We have them in L.A. and from time to time I would end up at one and I just wasn't too impressed. When this one opened up near me hear, I can't say I was too excited. The food is just ok and I think it's a little overpriced for what you actually get.   The only things I can say I actually enjoy here are the Ice cream shakes and their breakfast meals. Their onion rings are pretty good too, they just don't serve too many in an order, which is disappointing. Burgers are ok too.  If the prices were a tad bit lower I'd probably go more often, but as is it's more like fast food at restaurant prices."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! We ordered our food and after waiting for 40min we decided to get our money back and leave. When we spoke to the manager she admitted that the cooks were making everything out of order and they had no idea when my food would be coming out. What kind of a place doesn't have some kind of system in place to deal with large amounts of people on a Saturday morning! Before we left we saw tons of food siting there waiting to be picked up. If we had ever received our food I'm sure it would have been cold not to mention possible mistakes that everyone else here talks about. We weren't the only people who were dissatisfied, there was several people with complaints behind us. Farmer Boys on tropical you suck!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, fresh cooked to order food. The food takes a bit to get to the table but it is worth it The huge onion rings have a light breading. The fried Zucchini was long tasty spears    Our burgers were fresh and full of flavor. The French fries are hot shoe string potatoes.  Very much enjoyed the friendly service and the food.  We will be back."}
{"text":"So far so good. Friendly service, speed of food delivery ok, cold drinks and clean bathrooms. Our visit was on Saturday noontime, no wait to order and plenty of seating. They staff a lot of employees, order takers, food runners and general dinning room oversight/managers to re-fill drinks and dispose of dirty dishes. FYI- all the items are customizable, as in you can remove highly caloric ingredients from a dish if you eating low carb or watching calories. To get our science right checkout the website or app. Both my hubby's bowl and my salad came out exactly as ordered- so two thumbs up on that attention to detail. Sign up for the VIP app, got $5 off the first order and then after I logged my points, I get a free drink for the next visit."}
{"text":"Not worth the money! Went there with my mom no less and it was $27 dollars for 2 people.... In N Out all day over that!"}
{"text":"Beings this place is located directly across the street from the best car wash in town I'm in here at least once a week. So I can say with 100% accuracy that this place is on point. I always get the chicken fingers or a burger. Always fresh and very good. And the vanilla milkshake is amazing. Now I'm not a big fan of fast food however I feel this isn't even in that realm. There's typically a younger kid on the counter \"Dominique\" who is extremely polite, professional and very customer service oriented. I actually look forward to his good positive attitude as every employee here has the same disposition. Thanks guys for the great food and customer service!!!"}
