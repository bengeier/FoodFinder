{"text":"Don't believe their offer on Yelp for one free app!
Went there yesterday for dim sum. It was our first time there. We showed them their offer on Yelp but they said they can only give us sweet osmanthus jello (????, instead of an appetizer as shown on the offer. After we brought it up to the manger but in vain, we gave up and took the jello.  
The  place is spacious. Not crowded
Their dim sum is unique for a Chinese vegetarian restaurant. There're some hits and misses. But none of the dishes were memorable. 

Service as you can tell is not the greatest. 

Go there only when you crave for vegetarian"}
{"text":"Love the idea of real vegetarian food rather than fake duck and fake chicken.  They serve all my favourites - mushrooms, greens, soy and I'm not even vegetarian.  Vegetarian dim sum is not anything new but what's exceptional for this restaurant is it's the only kind of dim sum.  Most of the dishes we tried were very good - well made and presented.  Decor is bright and airy - lots of chandeliers and golden lotus - a lot of glitz for a Buddhist restaurant (owned by Cham Shan Temple).  For photos and more comments, see my blog post: http://foodsparks.blogspot.ca/2013/09/vegetarian-dim-sum.html"}
{"text":"Food is ok...expensive but expected for vegetarian.   Been here  3 times.  We had dinner...and Service was so so.  When we got the food... nobody asked if we wanted rice which is common practise. We were thinking of ordering a noodle dish to compensate for the rice and when we asked the manager if they can change the dish from fried chow mein to lo mein..he  basically laughed and walked off...so we weren't sure if he was putting the order in or not.

We had a Groupon but didn't bother to use the full $60 due to the poor service.

As we left there was another dissatisfied customer arguing with the manager....

Yup...Never coming again. 3 strikes your out."}
{"text":"I got groupon for two and went there last tuesday. It was not very busy, I think maybe due to weekday night.

We ordered three dishes, the food are tasty and nice. But still feel a bit pricey. 

The service is excellent, I finally saw a smile face on the waitress after had been so many chinese restaurants!

I got another groupon for four and will go there soon."}
{"text":"Used to think this place was decent for a veggie option but most recent visit was a letdown.

When we sat down, they did not offer any choice of tea but instead the server came with only one type. When we said we didn't order that type and asked if they had the other usual options, she gave us attitude and said \"this is the only pot we have, and if you don't want it then I'll give it to the next table.\"

After that lovely exchange we asked if they could provide a high chair. They reluctantly brought one out and the straps were broken. We mentioned it to them and they said that's the only high chair available. We didn't see any other high chairs in use in the entire restaurant.

Food was passable for a vegan place but the service definitely left something to be desired."}
{"text":"We wen there for dim sum on January 15 and did not know about their $2.80 dim sum special.  So we paid full price :(

We ordered 5 dim sums and one stir fried Buddha delight noodle (fixed vegetsbles and fried egg noodle).  The bill was $50 plus tax, a bit expensive for food that were made mostly of mushrooms, carrots and CANNED vegetables. 

This is my raining:
1. Tofu Rice roll quite good. But the tofu is deep fried so if you are counting calories, it is not very light. The offer of war soya sauce is a good sign of they care.

2. Steam dumpling with squash was good

3. Deep fried or baked fake BBQ pork pastry was good. But again folks, this is high calorie :)

4. Steamed dumpling with special flower wad presented well but it is tiny. 

5. Sticky rice buns - quite good 

Then the kicker ! Their signature Buddha Delight noodle at $17 a plate. 

6. Stir fired noodle is quite pricey at $17 because they put canned vegetables (water chestnut, bamboo shoot, mushroom) . The other Ingredients are chinese shiitake mushroom, yellow fungus, wood ear fungus and chinese chard vegetables. At $17 a place, they can use fresh water chestnut (2.49 a pound at T & T) and mushroom (only 3.49 a pound at Loblaws) . I was disappointed that the vegetsbles smelt like Tin which is effect of storing in a can for way too long.
They even cheap out in the chard. We got 4 pieces and they are $1.29 a pound . 
They even cheap out in carrots which will make the dish colorful and more pleasing, 

  there were 3 pieces of yellow fungus and 4 pieces of wood ear fungus. I think they will go a long way to add better quality ingredients like organic Korean mushroom (1.89 a package) , organic kings mushroom or oyster mushroom. 

NO canned vegetables please!  Because it ruins the taste of the 3 yellow fungus and shiitake mushroom... 

I went there because it was a restaurant highly recommended by my family. They are Buddhists so I had much higher expectations and with the high price tag. 

They need to stop being cheap on a signature dish like Buddha delight vegetarian noodle.  Based in the market orice of everything, it costs about $4 to make the entire dish at retail price ($1 for noodle, $1 for yellow fungus at $4 an ounce in dry weight, $1 for shitake dry mushroom at $10.99 a pound at dry weight, $0.60 from various  cans of water chest nut, bamboo and mushroom , $0.20 for chard) 

The service was good, as they kept filling up our tea pot. But they do not offer pepper sauce unless you asked, it would have been a norm with one of the steamed dump,Kings ad it is an imitstion Chui-chow dumpling. 

overall, I WIIL go back and I will not buy he Buddha delight because I can get the same at Congee Queen by asking them to hold the MSG and light oil treatment. It costs $8.50!  And they give me fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"Lost our reservation but still honor a table for us. It's an high end veg Chinese restaurant price range from $12.50 and up. The dishes are small portion and took them almost 2 hrs to bring up all 7 dishes we ordered. They tasted alright but I see mushroom on all dishes. They should try to widen up their variety of veg ingredients if you ask me. It ended up cost me total $114 and I gave $16 tips but the waitress still stare at me like we did not give any???
Hire more chefs and the price is too high. 
That's why you don't see any lineup even on weekends. I don't know how long they gonna last......."}
{"text":"Good place to host vegetarian friends.

I hosted a friend who is vegetarian and knows good Chinese vegetarian.   They enjoyed it very much and took their business card so they can head back again & host their friends.

The snow pea sprouts (I'm guessing was poached in broth) was so tasty, not oily at all ...compared to typical Chinese restaurants that stir-fry them.  Seems healthy & tasty.

The noodle soup is our favourite.  They claim to make the ramen-like noodles In-house, has a great bite to it.  Can have it with greens and mushroom or seaweed and fried tofu.  Simple dish but so tasty/great texture.

Had an eggplant dish that was sliced to look like the Chinese black bean eel dish.  It was served on steamed white tofu.   A bit salty with the black bean sauce so accompanying with rice will tone it down.

The fried wonton was a bit of a miss,...it came as big pieces of fried wonton skin but no filling/stuffing, just big pieces of nacho looking chip with sweet & sour dipping sauce on the side.  Although very tasty, it was not quite what we expected.

We did not order much this time, so will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Been here for both dinner and Dimsum.  The best vegetarian chinese restaurant that I have tried so far in Toronto.  Although a little bit more on the expensive side, but it is worth it if you are looking for a bit more fancy place.  While the dinner menu is on the more expensive side for chinese food, the Dimsum is quite reasonable, especially for happy hour when all the small=medium=large in terms of price.

Perhaps the reason the dishes are good is that they don't try to make fake meat, and just stick to truly being vegetarian dishes.  The black fungus appetizer is quite unique,  and most other dishes are great as well.  

The staff there are very friendly and efficient as well.  I've been coming back ever since trying it out."}
{"text":"The taste of their food is average, but the main problem is that none of the food items is what you would expect from what is depicted in their menu. 

Also we got horribly bad service and rudeness from one particular male staff wearing a black suit walking around (probably the supervisor), but the rest of the staff seems okay"}
{"text":"I actually passed this restaurant several times driving by before I finally said to myself that I need to check it out. It's definitely the nicest (decor and food presentation) Chinese vegetarian restaurant I have been to in Toronto. 

The food is very original but a tad bit on the pricey side. We had the purple sweet potato soup which was very different but tasted amazing. We also ordered the fried rice with pine nuts which was just perfect. Not oily at all. 

I would definitely go back again because there are other items I want to try. I also want to check out dim sum lunch since we only went for dinner."}
{"text":"Great veggie dim sum go-to for those new and experienced with dim sum. Many classics and innovative dishes to choose from, great service and large, open ambiance make this resto a repeat for me.

Steamed BBQ buns, congee, taro - all great!

And before noon on weekends all dim sum is $2.80 each, cash only, so head there early for great value."}
{"text":"I went there initially with a Groupon and I've gone back.   The food is great - at first you think you might not like anything, but then everything is subtly great.   The won-ton with sweet and sour sauce is simple but just great -- a really great homemade sauce.  The e-fu noodles are simple but great.  The soups (pumpkin/hot sour) are perfect...especially the hot and sour. Try some different things, its just creative food done well but with big portions - you get what you pay for.  Note: we went for dinner not dimsum, though would love to try the dim sum.

But what really is positive to me about the restaurant is the service.  They are really nice. Lisa, the manager, really tried to go out of her way to interact with our 3yr old.  They are kid friendly.  Overall I get this very mellow Buddhist vibe, and the patrons seem very much the same, the conversations are not loud or overly gregarious.

The interior is upscale with nice touches (huge chandelier) but still comfortable and spacious too.    It's a place you can go for a special occasion, with large group tables."}
{"text":"Came here last Sunday for an early dinner with family.  This is our second visit to Wu Tai.  We had a groupon, which made the otherwise pricier meal (for a Chinese vegetarian place), quite reasonable.  We ordered 4 dishes and one dessert and although we had asked that the dessert be served last, it ended up being served first.  When we had notified the first waitress, she acknowledged the issue, but walked away.  The second waiter was able to bring the dessert back to the kitchen to be served later.  

The presentation of the dishes is nice and the taste and quality is great.  However, be warned that service is slow.  The dishes were brought out one by one with a considerable wait time in between dishes.  Both visits we ordered a noodle dish and both times it was brought to the table last when we've already pretty much finished the rest of the dishes.

I would come back as I do think it's good quality and the food is yummy.  I would suggest going earlier for dinner as it does tend to get quite busy closer to the peak dinner time."}
{"text":"Environment is good. Food is ok. Cleanliness is good. Price is fair. Customer service is below average.

The male manager is very rude and impolite.

I would recommend to go only if you have a coupon/groupon. They will ask for tips based on full price but they don't deserve it with that attitudes."}
{"text":"We have been at this restaurant twice.  It is rather pricy but it is clean and the service is excellent.

The first time we enjoyed:
The soup dumpling (many tasty ingredients)  Really good!
Thousand layer cake (the spice left a wonderful taste in your mouth)
The other four dim sum were adequate.  The congee was rather bland.

Nevertheless, for just the first two items and the general atmosphere, we returned within eight days.

What a disappointment!
The soup dumpling not the same at all.  The majority of the ingredients were gone and it was thin and watery and we paid $5 each.
The spice was gone from the thousand layer cake, and while still reasonably tasty, it was not worth the money.

We were surprised the food quality went down so quickly and will not return.

We have been going to Graceful Vegetarian (Market Village) for many years.  It's quality is not spectacular like Wu Tai was the first time we went, but we can always count on Graceful to be consistent."}
{"text":"Great food selection especially for vegetarians! We went through the menu and ordered several items since they were so cheap! But don't be fooled. We had a hard time finishing all of it since portions were bigger than we anticipated. Overall a good problem to have when the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought I have written this restaurant but somehow couldn't find it in my review

Recommended by friend that it is good.  Browsing through its menu really found that there are a lot of varieties not found in traditional vegetarian Chinese restaurant.  

The most memorable dish is the A vegetable palm.  It is something different, soft but you can bite it.  Usually you can order fried A vegetable but never did I find the palm to be used.

The presentation of all dishes are nice and clean.

At the end, the waitress introduced us ??????? Wu Tai flower tea that is good for your stomach.  We bought some to try.  This is a good place to have vegetarian dishes.  Whatever you pay minus expenses is used to fund the building of the Wu Tai temple in Pickering that is now under construction.  You can have a meal and at the same time do some fund raising."}
{"text":"Overpriced and oversalted Buddhist vegetarian food with slow, uneven service. Would not go again, especially not for Saturday night dinner. Kitchen was unable to handle the full dining room, so dishes came out incredibly slowly and unevenly (i.e., tables which ordered after us got all their dishes before ours). 

Food was simply too salty in all the dishes (about 8 or 10) ordered. Rice in a fried rice dish was on the hard side. Green bean dessert soup was lukewarm at best.

Service was also lacking. When asked to explain why an appetizer was missing two flavours of wheat gluten listed on the menu, the waitstaff claimed you had a choice of the three flavours, not that you got the three flavours of wheat gluten. Wasn't indicated on the menu nor were we asked when ordering which flavour we wanted. Also, the wrong dish was delivered to us.

Considering the price, I would find it hard to go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here for dim sum and dinner now. I like this vegetarian restaurant. There's not many in this area and the dishes are good and creative.

Food
Lots of choice and some unique dishes. Although all veggies, they sound and taste good. Only thing I wish they would do better is amount of oil (dinner dishes, dim sum were okay). I forgot to mention less oil so some of the dishes were a bit too oily for my taste especially since I wasn't going there to eat healthy. See pic for dishes ordered. 

Decor
Nice, clean and huge restaurant. Very comfortable with tables being decently spaced apart."}
{"text":"Service: if you are Asian, and if you bought their groupon voucher, most likely you will have no service. 1 the front desk lost our reservation. 2 before we sit down, the manager asked us to get out within 1.5 hour (WTF! In all-you-can eat restaurant you can sit for 2hours at least) 3 we waited for more than 20mims for a soup dish... (not to mention the time limit thing they forced on us) 4 when my friend still ate the soup & there are still some food on table, the server came by to wrap up everything 

As a nice person, I still tip the server 10% on full price ( before the voucher reduction) But I usually tip 15% for dinner in other restaurant.

Food : Good for a three star, although a little bit salty

I would highly recommend my Caucasian friends to visit this restaurant. Also remember to pay full price, no groupon thing welcomed here!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice, clean, the staff were friendly, but after 45 minutes I'd only received two of the four dim sum dishes I ordered even though they came by every ten minutes to check up on me. When I paid, the manager was apologetic but charged me for the two small dishes with barely an apology and I was looked down upon for not leaving a tip. Strange experience for me."}
{"text":"Certainly not light, kinda greasy, but very tasty. Lots of great vegan options."}
{"text":"First time to try dim sum here on a busy sunday morning.  Had an assortment of dishes, some of the dishes were quite oily and heavy, particularly the pastry/fried items.  Flavours are more on the lighter side compared to traditional dim sum places.  Liked the fact that they serve hot soy on the side in a jar for you to pour.  Just ok dim sum, not a place that I would come regularly."}
{"text":"Greatest vegetarian restaurant in GTA.
I usually go to have lunch and supper with my friends and family.  The food quality and price are value.  However, don't think it is similar as 'Congee Queen' kind of restaurant, the quality are more up higher."}
{"text":"Tons of great vegetarian dim sum options here but most noteworthy is the congee. The meat congee here is the best vegetarian congee in the GTA."}
{"text":"I visited with my family to celebrate an early Mother's Day. We do not typically eat vegetarian dishes. My mom's friend recommended this place, so we decided to give it a try.
Overall the food was surprisingly good. We liked the Crispy Fried Milk with mushrooms, which had the nice salty-sweet contrast. Mapo Tofu was passable but nothing I would die for. My mom found a hair in the dish, and the server promptly switched it to something else. Our favourite was the Lohan Noodles, which was like Cantonese Chow Mien but with mushrooms. After the meal, the server served us some sweet almond soup as a dessert. The only thing we did not like was that everything we ordered was a touch more greasy that we were comfortable with. If we come back, then I would include non-greasy dishes in my order."}
{"text":"When I heard about a high end vegetarian dim sum place I was a bit skeptical, but was reassured when I stepped inside. The location used to be an average Chinese restaurant, but they really updated the interior with the plush red chairs and chandelier that was a departure from the previous tenants. 

Prices are quite reasonable given its high end aspirations and the food and presentation don't disappoint. From the silver trimmed china to the wooden boxes holding up the fried and baked pastries it manages to compete against the look of Casa Victoria. 

The food was quite creative, from the fried pastry looking like a pear sitting on a wooden box to the rice rolls with melons and king mushroom, you can tell the chef put some effort into making the menu his own. My personal favourite is the dessert of fried sesame balls with a sweet bitter melon filling. The filling was sweet and had a depth that highlights the melon's taste. 

Will definitely return for whenever I want to get my vegetarian on. But next time I will order less, as every dish was loaded with carbs!"}
{"text":"I went to Wu Tai a few weeks ago for lunch/dim-sum and it was definitely some of the best vegetarian food i've ever had. Most of the dishes were nicely presented and the service was on point. The ambiance is nice with uniformed waiters, high ceilings and even chandeliers. It's a tad bit pricier than your average dim sum though. I was a bit surprised to learn that Wu Tai is owned by a Buddhist temple.The whole experience made me think twice about vegetarian food. 

The BBQ \"pork\" buns are tasty and you won't miss the real pork. Their mushroom pastry is also delicious. They are light, crispy and oh so flavorful. It's served with a huge western salad which is a little weird, but it does compliment the dish. Other standouts include the squash soup, asparagus rice rolls and the vegetarian fun guo. If you like durian and want a post-dim sum dessert, I would also recommend the durian puff pastries. I'd return in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Visited Wutai with the wife as she is vegetarian and she wanted to explore the vegetarian Chinese food (not Hakka). The decor was very good and it was very spacious but still busy. We went around 5-6 PM on Sunday evening. Plenty of parking at the back.

Hot and Sour Wood Fungus and Tofu soup - Good.
Thai Style Flavoured Mushroom hotpot - Good
Osmanthus Flower Cake - Very different than anything we had tried and very pretty good.
Noodles with shredded cucumber - Good

This is a nice place if you're looking for a nice dining experience and you're willing to give vegetarian food a chance."}
{"text":"This is my first vegetarian dim sum experience and I am IMPRESSED! the food is created in a way that highlights it's fresh ingredients like mushrooms, tofu and choy without pretending to be meat. Dim sum staples like fried taro root dumpling and spring rolls were crispy and tasty. At dim sum, my favourite dishes are BBQ pork bun and shrimp rice noodles. Both dishes at Wu Tai were delicious, the bun was soft and the taste of filling was amazing. The tofu choy rice noodle \"cheung fun\" also yummy! 
The servers at this place are quick and responsive too, looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It wiuld get four stars if not for the msg. Good variety of dishes, some really tasty. Service is good and ambiance pleasant."}
{"text":"I have taken my family to this place before.  We were quite happy with the service and food.  Recently, I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  We were not happy at all with the service and food.  First, they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet.  We had no service at all.  The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.  We would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian food. But avoid this place if incompetent management and disorganization ruin your appetite. The wait staff are generally friendly and helpful. The manager is completely confused, disorganized, and doesn't know how to run the place. There was a female manager I really liked but she's not here anymore. The male manager gave away 2 tables because he didn't stick to the wait list and was dumbfounded when we told him we were waiting for our number to be called. There is also a girl who sits at the computer at the front, she is not helpful either. If you speak Chinese, check it out. Otherwise, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for vegetarian dim sum. I didn't think much of this place when I heard vegetarian dim sum, but this place does dim sum very well with vegetarian ingredient, even better than some meat based dim sum place. It's perfect to take your vegetarian friends here if they have never tried dim sum before."}
{"text":"My favourite vegetarian restaurant in Toronto area. They do not try to mimic the meat dishes, instead they cook the real vegetarian dishes that are delicious while not reminding you of any meat flavour. Worthy to try."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer** I AM a meat lover!

Okay so I've been to one other vegetarian Chinese place, and the quality here is 100% better. Obviously pricier here, and it is always difficult for me to justify paying more for veg dishes as much as I'd pay for meat dishes elsewhere...buuuuttt... this place will surprise you.

I've been here twice with my wife's fam and ordered well over $200 in dishes both times (also never the same dish)and you really can't go wrong.

Seasonings on most dishes are not too salty, or overpoweringly sweet. Really well made dishes.

All I really have to say however, is you can leave the restaurant feeling full, but within an hr or so I was hungry again.  

Overall, pricey to eat at, but great choice if you're a meat lover with vegetarian friends!"}
{"text":"We seemed to be the only Americans there but the staff was friendly and helpful. There were many unique food choices and the food was good. They gave us free tea and dessert! The portions looked small so we got 4 items to share, so much food! Two would've been plenty"}
{"text":"solid asian chinese food. Portions are huge but prices are overpriced as well. found a dirty bowl before i ate. all in all, solid restaurant would come again"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars. They make all chinese dim sum look alikes without meat. Taste is ok but has nothing to do with being veggetarian more with the sauces."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend who is highly allergic to all types of nuts (especially cashews). We clarified this with whom I would assume is the manager and she mentioned they do not cook with any nuts.

One of the dumpling orders contained cashews in it and my boyfriend had to use his Epi pen and leave the restaurant immediately. I brought this up to one of the waiters and he argued that we only said \"no peanuts\" when we obviously said all nuts since we repeat the same thing at every restaurant. He left me sitting at the table for 15 minutes until I got irritated and got up to speak to the manager, who then claimed she waived the bill while still arguing that we said no peanuts.

This place literally left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I came here today on Nov.3.2014 with my family .

The service was fabulousssss!! They kept pouring us tea! Also cleaned the tables as soon as we finished one dish ! They also have very nice manners~
 
Loved the e-fu eggplant noodles the best !!so yummy and filling and the eggplant had a bit of crisp!! 

Going to come back to try the dimsum soon :)!"}
{"text":"The restaurant manager was RUDE and shamelessly RACIST. I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. The table next to us was a Caucasian party and the manager went out of his way to pleasing that table the entire time, meanwhile neglecting us completely! His need to pleasing the other ethnicity was completely shameless and disgusting. What made this outrageous was that he had mistakenly given OUR dishes to the other table without so much as an apology. At the end of the meal, we had an issue with the bill, and he marched over and used an uncompromising and condescending tone towards us. He was blatently unappreciative of our business, so I will  not contribute even one penny to his profit. I feel badly for the serving and the kitchen staff who have to work alongside this racist petty little man. The way he treated us was entirely unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian restaurant, I think the name speaks for itself. I don't have much to say because my boyfriend is watching me as I type, I'm stressed lols.

Dishes that we ordered (party of 11)
- Preserved olive leaves fried rice
- Braised E-fu noodles with bean sprouts
- Crispy fried milk with mushrooms
- Sauteed seasonal vegetables with bean curd sauce
- Purple sweet potato and fungus soup
- Yellow ear and seasonal vegetables soup
- Thai-styled flavoured mushroom

I got a little lazy and didn't take any photos so google it yourself lols.

[Service]
Food comes out slow, I am warning you! The staff are all very nice, but not everyone speaks English. One of the people we were dining with commented that she used her phone to assist her in communicating with the staff (I really don't think this is needed).

[Food]
If you were to come here and order only 1 dish, I highly recommend the \"Crisp fried milk with mushrooms\".  It is nothing like you would imagine. It is a very common dish in the Chinese book of cuisine lols, the exterior surface is super crunchy. While biting into these tiny crunchies, you will be embraced by EXTREMELY soft condensed-milk textures. Now, I do not know if they use condensed milk here as others have noted they substituted it with coconut milk. The whole thing tastes amazing and is probably better known as a dessert, but the oyster mushrooms on the side are salty enough to create a balance. By the way, everything is mushrooms in this restaurant.

[Price]
It's not cheap. And for those of you who usually eat meat, you might find your stomach feeling a little unsatisfied. As such, it would be smart to order the rice and noodle dishes - at least you get some carbohydrates."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by how good this place was.  Vegetarian dim sum seems almost like an oxymoron. While eating I barely noticed that the meat was missing because everything was good.  Clean and reasonably priced. Lots of space and large tables.  Dishes are presented nicely."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian Chinese in Toronto, maybe on the planet. And the worst-kept secret. After an Asian friend tipped me off about this place, I asked around and found that almost e every Asian in Toronto knows about it. It is run by monks. it is a wonderfully furnished restaurant with great staff and great service. They use only the simplest ingredients. Their challenge is to prepare tasty dishes from healthy ingredients and they met the challenge. Their two types of congee are the best in Toronto and addictive. The fried Lotus cake is better than a hambuger. The Singapiore Turnip is to die for. Ditto the spring rolls. Ditto the whole menu. Best value is lunch from the Dim Sum menu which actually has a lot more dishes than just  Dim Sum. Super value if you arrive before 12, they discount most of the Dim Sum, which is already a bargain. Happy happy joy joy."}
{"text":"We got a groupon for this restaurant and called ahead to make a reservation, but it didn't seem like we needed it cause they just said ok and didn't ask for my name or number. After we were seated, I told them we had a groupon and the waitress took my phone to show it to their manager at the front desk. It looks like they don't like people using groupons because the manager kept glaring at us the whole meal and I felt very uncomfortable. I checked in on Yelp and saw the dessert offer, so I showed that to the waitress as well and she got it for us. When we went up to pay, they charged us for the dessert and I had to explain that we got it using the Yelp offer but they said it was for lunch but it clearly says available for dinner as well. I don't know why they would have such offers if they give us such a hard time redeeming it. Also there were a lot of fruit flies, so if you don't like them taking a pit stop on your plate then avoid coming here during the summer. Overall, the food was good but it was the most uncomfortable dining experience I've ever had and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. It was a really cold day so the place was nearly empty, which might have been better as we had more peace which is so rare in a Chinese restaurant.

First impression is that the decor is nice. After we got the menu, we noticed that most items are pretty pricey, but the pictures look nice. We got a bowl of noodles and a plate of mushroom/veggies/dough thingy. It's hard to describe in English. 

The noodle was decent. The portion is much larger than expected, especially when you compare it to the size of the veggie/mushroom plate. The plate was just ok. The tastes here are more \"mild\" compared to other chinese places. I also found the sizes we had to have very little oil, and probably very little MSG. So I'm happy with their cooking skill, but what we had is not something we would crave.

The noodle bowl was $7.5 which is reasonable, but if the plate was any indication, the rest of their menu items are much less reasonable. The veggie/mushroom plate costs $15. I can get a plate of veggies at any other Chinese place for half the price.

Worth another shot for their dim sum. But I don't think their dinner menu is that good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is yummy. The server was nice. It's a bit on the pricey side because it IS vegetarian but they actually serve you at the table by bowl. The plates are gorgeous.  Looks very banquet style. Highly recommended to try the unique style dishes."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday and we arrived at 10:30 a.m. when they opened.  There were already people inside when we arrived a few minutes after the restaurant opened.  Unbeknownst to me, if you order before 11 a.m., all of the dim sum dishes are only $2.98!  What a steal!  I didn't realize this otherwise I would have ordered more of the medium and large sized dim sum dishes.

Although my first visit here was a bit lackluster, I found that I really enjoyed the food this time around.  Maybe it was because we ordered better choices this time and because my friend and I had a good chat, it made the overall meal much more enjoyable too.

I really enjoyed the Fried Taro Dumpling.  Instead of the usual taro and meat inside, they substituted it here with mushrooms.  It was very delicious!

The Sticky Rice Siu Mai was also an unsuspecting favourite.  The sticky rice was like hearty comfort food to me.  I gobbled this up quickly.

The Fried Bun with Creamy Pumpkin Stuffing was actually brought home since we had so much food.  When I ate it at home, of course it wasn't as tasty as if I had eaten it there fresh at the restaurant.

The Steamed Seaweed & Vegetable Fritter Rice Roll was also very good.  It was presented with each rice roll standing up vertically on the plate which made it look so fancy.

The Vegetable Wraps with Cabbage was very wholesome and tasty too.

The Tofu Skin Roll was also very good.  My friend especially liked this one because it's been years since she's had this as a vegetarian style one -- usually the ones at dim sum are filled with meat.

The Honey Grapefruit Raindrop Cake was interesting.  It really played off of the current food trends of a \"raindrop cake\".  Unfortunately, it proved to be hype since it was just grapefruit jello and nothing too spectacular about it.  It was paired with some random tangerines and a mound of red bean.  Hmm..

Lastly, we received the Triple Flavoured Gluten Dish; a classic Chinese vegetarian dish.  It's assorted flavoured gluten and I really enjoyed it!  It was moist and flavourful.  (It's also a Chef's Special dish which can only be ordered after 11 a.m.)

After this successful visit, my views of this restaurant went up considerably.  If you come here for dim sum, I highly suggest coming after 11 a.m. and place your order so that each dim sum is only $3 regardless of the size!  One thing I did notice is that we were both very full and I was very satiated after the meal.  Perhaps a reason for this full feeling could be that they use a lot of oil in their cooking... which perhaps isn't that healthy even though everything was meat-free and vegetarian."}
{"text":"Do love the food here, especially vegetarian dim sum! I'm not a vegetarian but I love the food here! I crave for their imitation pork buns and their dough fritter roll. Personally dim sum and much better than dinner and better food for value. Customer service on the hand can be a hit a miss"}
{"text":"I went to Wutai Vegetarian Restaurant and would highly recommend it to all my vegetarian friends. They're located on Woodbine Ave, close to Hwy 7 in Markham (near Costco and Tiger Direct). The food was really flavourful and tasted so fresh. The best part for me was that they don't use any onions or garlic (not even spring onions), so you could really taste the other flavours in the food. They don't offer the 'mock meat' stuff like Graceful or Lotus Pond if that's what you're looking for, but there are so many other fantastic options to choose from (check out the lunchtime Dim Sum). My family and I have been going to Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant for years, but as of the last 5 years or so, the food has gotten considerably more 'corn-starchy' and less fresh. Wutai Vegetarian Restaurant is owned by the Buddhist Cham Shan Temple in Peterborough, and all the proceeds go toward developing the site and their meditation retreats etc. Give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"4 stars for the bbq buns, congee, siu mai, radish cake and radish with mushroom, chestnut and anise. Overall, the quality has been consistent. 1 star off for quantity as portions have been increasingly shrinking, which is rather disappointing."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes we're very good. Being a vegan family and from out of town there were plenty of dishes to choose from. The server was never seen again after all our 11 dim sum dishes were delivered. After waiting about 10 min after we finished our food. I walked to the counter to pay for the bill. To my surprise we were charged $6 for 'tea and sauce' the lady said it's like that everywhere else. To charge for 'tea and sauce' they should at least let their customers know. What a crock! I think they're milking the customer. Vietnamese restaurants NEVER charge their customers for 'tea and sauce' and the food is not expensive for Vegans at Vietnamese restaurants. I was not happy with the practice so I left $3 tip for a $50 bill and one of the waitress (she's not even ours) had the audacity to tell me to tip more. She demanded I tip another $2. Are you effing kidding me telling customers what to tip. I should have left a fat $0. I'll stick to Vietnamese Vegan restaurants since they don't rob you. My wife and I are still laughing over $6 for 'tea and sauce' as we're shaking our heads. Never going back for $6 'tea and sauce'"}
{"text":"Expensive..definitely ask for recommendation on what to order. I ordered something which I just dint like .."}
{"text":"A fancy and bustling chinese vegetarian restaurant with huge crystal chandliers to boot. It was very noisy in the dining room on a holiday Monday at 8:30pm. The place was close to 3/4 full. Some monks were dining there.

I can't say we were blown away by the food. Some of the dishes, like the wontons, were not exactly what we expected. The sauce for it was too sweet. The noodle dish ended up being the best thing we had. I can't say I'd go out of my way to eat here again, but if you're in the area and want to try something different, go for it."}
{"text":"I am excited about eating in vegetarian restaurant. This one seems to be affiliated with a Buddhist organization.

The decor is actually very grand like other Chinese restaurants, but with a religious theme 

Today they offered the Chinese new year menu so they didn't even present their regular menu. We found our waitress abrupt but attentive. Could just be the way she spoke. 

WE like the cream pumpkin soup the best.  The soup is very smooth and the corn kernels provide some sweetness. There's a surprise element with the crunchiness from the white fungus. 

The fruit salad was just okay. While it was nicely presented and we liked the dumplings, the salad itself was lackluster- mainly all you could taste was the nice sour and sweetness of the dressing but the fruits (dragon fruits and melons) flavour was lacking

I do like the 2 stir fry dishes with the shan Yao and the unknown type of fungus that smells like truffle. The asparagus add a nice touch but I would like to have more shan Yao please lol...

We were not so sure about the fry rice in the lotus leaf. According to the waitress, they make the fry rice first, then steam it in lotus leaf. I don't know why they'd do that second step because the steaming process totally change the texture of the fry rice and the whole dish just taste like regular rice dish...soft and gooey- not that it's not good, but just that when you order fry rice you expect the bouncy texture of individual rice grain on your tongue lol

For dessert we got the red bean soup which is a free given. We tried to see if we could try their other dessert (and willing to pay) but tonight they only had one type left.

I like the food overall. It's rare to get to eat Chinese food without a heavy feeling settle in your belly. Perhaps I just need to go back more frequently to figure out which dishes to order..."}
{"text":"This review is for the Dinner menu. I would still come here to try the dim sum one day.

The place is nice and big, with a good parking lot and very friendly service.
The menu is big with a lot of selection.

The food is nice and not heavy, or greasy, but lacks flavour, not for those who wants flavorful food (which is me)

The dishes we which got, kind of had the same ingredients in it.

there a lot of mushrooms and a lot of eggplant used.
there's always something fried (over breaded and thick)

something fried + mushrooms (is what most dishes seemed like to me)

the noodles was mushy and no texture."}

{"text":"Food was good. A lot of the dim sum looks exactly like the meat counter part. Place was clean, service was good and it wasn't expensive at all. Good variety in their menu too."}
{"text":"We like coming to Wu Tai because the veggie food is different from your typical vegetarian Chinese restaurant.  The decor is much more extravagant and the food is nicely plated.  We especially like the appetizer of 3 types of tofu, fried milk with a variety of mushrooms, and the sticky rice wrapped in little triangular tofu sheets.  Those are pretty much our staples and then we try something else each time.  

Today we weren't impressed with the service.  Lisa is amazing, but we aren't sure if she's still there?  The rice lady came out and served it with her whole hand cupping the top of the rice so that was pretty gross.  I basically just took the top layer off before eating it.  There was a nice plate of eggplant with a \"nest\" looking thing, but she just threw it onto the table rather than placing it and turning the plate around so that the presentation would be nicer.  Oh well... At least the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Came to this place a few times after purchasing a couple of Groupons for $30 worth of food for $17. This place doesn't look like much from the outside but when you step in, the restaurant is surprisingly quite clean and fairly elegant.

Thanks to the reviews of fellow Yelpers, we ordered some pretty tasty food items including mushroom tarts which were served in cute little wooden boxes. We also ordered the braised eggplant e-fu noodles. This was by far my favourite dish, as the noodles were slightly chewy, flavourful and served with just enough mildly spicy sauce such that the dish was not dry. We also tried the fried milk and king mushrooms, both of which were nothing to write home about in my opinion.

For dessert, we ordered the sweetened pancake with walnuts and cashews. This was surprisingly satisfying, both in texture and sweetness.

I'm pretty sure I couldn't give up meat permanently but eating some of the dishes here opened my eyes to some delicious vegetarian options that I would happily eat during those times when I'm looking for meatless alternatives. Definitely recommended for vegetarians and meat eaters to give this place a try!

(67/100)"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food I've ever tasted and I love that everything is vegetarian. The menu is huge and varied and the flavours are nuanced and delicate. I will definitely be returning and bringing others with me. Great for a quiet dinner but portions also allow for family-style eating."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try more vegetarian food lately so I found a deal on Buytopia.  I bought the voucher and tried it with some friends and it turned out quite good.  The price is a bit higher than usual vegetarian food  used to at Chinatown in Toronto,  but the food was better presented,  fresher,  and much less greasy. 


My friends and I ordered:

- sticky rice with mushroom (triangle looking thing),  that was likely my favourite

- mixed vegetable noodles (chow mein) - yummy

- crushed tofu fried balls (wasn't as good as it looked,  but tasted better when dipped in soya sauce and/or hot sauce

- grilled eggplant 

- snow pea leafs w mushrooms



Photos are posted in the gallery. 

The bill came up to $95.00, our coupon allowed up $60 worth of food for $30. We paid a different of $45.00 with tip. Not too bad. The portion is a decent size."}
{"text":"I honestly love this dim sum place. The fake \"meat\" tastes so much like the real meat. I'm not a meat person, but I love dimsum so i have limited options when I go to dimsum places. So this place is great for me. The dim sum is also really fresh. The service is great too! I love the pumpkin filled seasame ball. The outer layer is crispy and the filling is super tasty without it being too sweet. However since this is a vegetarian resturant I would recommend checking to see if it is one of those Buddhist holidays before coming. Because they usually don't eat meat during those days, so it can be quite crowded without reservation.

{"text":"Great vegetarian foods. But now the special prices tea is Monday to Friday only, from 10:30am - 12:00am. Saturday & Sunday is regular prices be carful"}
{"text":"Updated: Raised from a 2-star to a 3-star.  Service is okay but during a few cases they lost our reservations due to confusion on their part.  The food is not bad. However they do only accept cash.  In today's somewhat advanced society, there should be more options in terms of payment available for customers other than cash.  That is my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Prices were kind of high, I think you're paying more for the dining ambiance than the actual food. The dishes can be pretty hit or miss, but in general I can describe the taste as being excessively bland. The only dish that I really enjoyed was the tofu appetizer, but you can find that in a lot of Shanghai restaurants. There are better and cheaper vegetarian/vegan places to eat in Markham, NY and Scarborough than Wu Tai. Would not recommend. 

For any vegans out there, some dishes have milk, so don't buy them. If it looks like there's cheese or milk in it - there is."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family on a Friday night.

The food was way too salty and each order took really long.  
We ordered three dishes.  The second dish did not arrive until we were done our first dish.  After finishing our second dish, the third dish was still M.I.A.  We waited for 15 minutes and then asked a waitress to follow up on it.  She came back and told us it was being made.  We waited another 10 minutes and the dish still did not arrive.  We asked another waitress for a follow up and she also told us that it was being made.  We waited 5 more minutes and just asked for the dish to be cancelled because it was taking way too long to make a dish of stir fried vegetables.  The hostess was very apologetic and offered us a small discount when we paid our bill.

The waiters and waitresses provided relatively good service however for the cost of the dishes and the time it took to make them, I would have expected more than an over salted dish.  My family and I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner previously and wanted to try their dimsum as I've heard many good things. There aren't many chinese vegetarian restaurants around but this is as good as it gets. My favorite dish would be the pumpkin and red bean coated with almonds."}
{"text":"Wu Tai is specifically a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant and it is run by the Cham Shan Temple on Bayview in Thornhill. My family and I came here to try the vegetarian dim sum. They do have an early bird special on their dim sum in the morning until 12 I believe. 

Their more traditional items such as cheung fun (steam rice noodle) and glutinous rice bun were both very good. The bun had both brown and black glutinous rice, which is rare and surprisingly flavourful. I would definitely recommend ordering the rice bun and this is an item that is hard to order nowadays at most dim sum places (even in hong kong!) However, the baked pineapple pastry and the fried taro pastry were both quite disappointing. They lacked in flavour, dry and not hot enough. Lastly, we order a mango mochi and the mango was just too sour. The little bit of sweet mango sauce that was used to decorate the plate, manage to make the mochi palatable and we had to pack the rest up.

The presentation of the dim sum was very attractive, especially the little bamboo steamers. However, the taste could not match its pretty exterior. I would come again but would definitely stick to the steamed items for dim sum."}
{"text":"Finding a good Chinese vegetarian restaurant is hard. But this one I gotta say, is a keeper.

A bit more on the expensive side, but also much more quality. I came for dinner with my family and we got:
Eggplant e-fu Noodles/Mix Vegetables with Crispy Noodles: Actually done really well. The crunchy noodles were actually crunchy! 

Wintermelon and Taro Pot: My favourite. If you love your root veggies, then this is for you. The taro is on point, it's cooked enough where it still holds it shape when you pick it up with your chopsticks. But it's soft enough that it absorbs the sauces. SO. GOOD.

The service when you're at the restaurant is great. They're really attentive and they're pretty quick with the food. The only bump in my experience was booking a reservation with a groupon during Chinese New Year. Just a note, even if the voucher might not say there are restricted dates, double check with this restaurant. There are days they don't take it; which is kind of misleading. But in the end, the manager apologized and offered us a special dessert for when we do visit the restaurant. It was actually nice that the manager tried to resolve our discontent! Not a lot of Chinese restaurants accommodate (as I'm sure many of you know), so this was a really nice gesture. 

Now I'm curious about their dimsum."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends. One of them had a groupon. Never been here before. The restaurant looked grand inside, but it wasn't a large restaurant. I saw a lot of dim sum pictures on yelp and I was kind of looking forward to trying them. But unfortunately they were only available during the day. 

We ordered a few dishes to try:

1. Pumpkin Corn White Fungus Soup.
This soup was kind of a fusion dish. It was quite tasty. I would recommend this one.

2. Mashed Potato Fried Balls Coated with 
Crushed Almonds. 
This dish was way overpriced. Basically a deep fried mashed potato ball for $5/ea. And it also had kiwi slice and some strawberry sauce. Kind of a weird combo...

3. Eggplant Stir fried E-fu Noodles.
The dish was not bad, but I thought it could of had a bit more sauce, it was a bit dry.

4. Tofu & Fried Gluten Vegetarian Platter.
Usual dish at most vegetarian restaurant, also no bad.

5. Lotus Root Glutinous Rice Bean Curd Pancakes.
This was an interesting dish. The lotus root was chopped up mixed with glutinous rice n Mock Pork Floss, then it's wrapped around in bean curd triangles. 

6. Chrysanthemum Wolfberries Jellies.
This was kind of disappointing, the plating was not like the picture and it was a bit dry, hard and too sweet.

7. Mango Tapioca Pudding.
This was also very stiff, like they added too much agar agar, and bland in flavour.

Overall the food wasn't bad.
I would come back to try the dim sum someday."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon for four people, but the manager told us we cannot use it for three people. They told me that I can only use half of the value if we had three people. What they are trying to do is pretty obvious: the food of the groupon is not enough for four people, so customers need to order more when they arrive the restaurant. And customers will be charged for desserts fee for each person (like others mentioned). 
The groupon is not available for a few selected dates on groupon, but it cannot be used on any holidays actually."}
{"text":"No longer giving free app if you mention Yelp. Will give 10% off the whole bill if you pay in cash. 

Very unique dishes using lots of different vegetarian options. I really liked the spring roll dish, taro tofu, pickled fungus, fried rice, and various mushroom dishes. 

Make sure you make a reservation. It's pretty busy. We got our own room for 11 people."}
{"text":"I have completely fallen in love with this place. 
To start off, the decor is amazing. The staff are extremely friendly and informative. I have been here for both dim sum on a weekend morning as well for dinner and I loved them both. Their portion sizes are large and are definitely meant to be shared. The flavours are just right, whether it crispy tofu, the noodles or ANY of their soups. They have very generous servings and the staff are very attentive. 
I will definitely be going back to this place over and over again."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is awesome, especially if you're vegetarian :)! I've gone here on multiple occasions with my family for dinner and dim sum, and we're always impressed with the food!"}
{"text":"My first time having vegetarian dim sum (second time at a vegetarian restaurant) and I am impressed! This is a great place for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians as the dim sum is pretty close to the regular fare; I like that it uses real vegetables/vegetarian ingredients instead of \"fake meat\" items. Clean, spacious and comfortable interior. 

I particularly liked and would recommend:

- Stir fried flat rice noodles (beef replaced with bean curd) - pretty good and legit, goes well with the hot sauce which is really good 
- Lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice
- Osamathus & Red Dates clear pudding dessert
- Walnut & cashews pancake dessert (large portion)
- Choi sum (in a broth with ginger shreds)
- Chayote & mushroom rice noodle roll - very simple and clean pairing
- Deep fried bitter melon - coated with batter/bread crumbs instead of duck egg yolk. Very light and crispy batter!

I wanted to try walnut paste bun, mushroom tart and congee but they were sold out (around 1:30pm)

My impression of vegetarian Chinese food has definitely changed after dining here and I will return!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Recommend for any serious Vegetarians or Vegans.  A regular customer"}
{"text":"First time here, was pleasantly surprised...

We came in late evening and they were very accommodating even though we are one of last patrons to walk in, and the last ones to walk out...

Service was prompt...We got seated right away and they brought us their complimentary tea...

We ordered 1 Lotus Soup, 1 Sweet & Sour Soup, 1 Fried Tofu with Seaweed Platter, 1 Mix Vegetables with Crispy Noodles, and 2 Ice Creams...

The food quantity is ginormous...!!!

We finished our soups, but could only finish half our food...There was more surprise at the end...Each Ice Creams come in 2 portions and they serve a complimentary dessert...So we ended up with 6 cups of desserts instead of 2...Would have been nice if they mentioned that about their complimentary dessert & double portions of ice creams on their menu or if the servers mentioned it to us...

Food is a bit pricey being a \"Fine Dining\" establishment...But with their ginormous quantities, it's not too high priced..."}
{"text":"i went for dim sum at this joint.  i liked the fact that they did not use any of them taiwanese mock meats and stuff....you know what i am talking about.  they make their own vegetarian dishes and the dim sum was pretty decent.  not that greasy and i did not have a dry mouth when i got home meaning not that much msg was used.  the place is nicely decorated and it's got a great ambiance to it.  the washroom was pretty clean and modern looking.  it's an upscale place and so the prices of the dishes reflect this.  the waiting staff are ok, kinda slow if you ask me.  the manager also was a bit weird.  we were asking for some vinegar and more but he just sped off to another table and we could only ask him for the vinegar!   he just walked away without hearing our requests.  presentation of the food was pretty good.  i would come back here again."}
{"text":"Be adventurous and take a break from the usual dimsum options for vegetarian dimsum. Get pro level status and order before 12am to get the S, M, L options at one low price of $2.88!! XL dishes are still $5.60.... but at least you can fill up on the other stuff first. 

Dim sum recommendations would be the Veg. Crispy Rice Roll, Crystal Clear Dumplings and maybe try their version of BBQ Bun to see if you can give up actual BBQ. Desserts are not overly sweet but tends to rely on the natural flavouring for the fruits or the texture of nuts to deliver some delight. Perfect examples would be the Sweeten Pancakes with Walnuts and Cashew or the Mango Mochi. Dishes are on the smaller side but delicately made with attention to presentation and detail."}
{"text":"I've always been 'eluded' by this restaurant every time I exit the 407 for another dim sum place but finally this weekend we gave it a shot.

We ordered vegetarian dumplings, rice rolls with tofu, tofu wrapped mushrooms, e-fu eggplant noodles, chinese greens, avocado & mushroom rolls. The entire bill came up to $50 with taxes, but considering we ate it for dinner as well it was a pretty good deal.

The flavors are all there. The reason I'm not leaning towards a higher rating is the consistency of the wrappers - both the dumplings & the rice rolls were too mushy. Perhaps its because they are rice and not flour? I'm not sure..but it was too gooey and mushy to eat. I find the pan fried dishes taste and hold up much better than their steamed counterparts.

Definitely give them props for the great service! The staff is very friendly & accommodating of any requests/questions and it is definitely a bonus! we will definitely return to do a follow up."}

Everything is good here : )

{"text":"One year after my original review, I thought I'd write an update. I've been coming to this place on occasion and they have continued to refresh their menu. It's been some time since I've been here for dinner, but they have refreshed the dim sum menu. Always encouraging to see restaurants continuing to innovate and improve themselves. Quality continues to be there and food is fresh.

Some people will find the food bland. Certainly there are a number of dishes with lighter flavours, and the fact that it's hard to tell what the dish is from its name on the menu doesn't really help the situation. Ask the staff if you're ever having trouble. The flavours here are very different from your traditional Chinese/dim sum restaurants (i.e. salty, MSG heavy, greasy) so if that's what you are looking for, this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday night. Wow this place is full. We found the staff to be courteous. We had a reservation and they were prompt in assigning a table. 

The best part is this place is pure vegetarian. They don't even use onions and garlic. So we did not have to go thru our routine of explaining the staff of what is vegetarian and what is not. 

Food was delicious and portions were large. It definitely worth a shot for all those vegetarian people out there. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Updated April 2018:

Unfortunately, the quality here has dropped since my initial review. It is still ok, but overall, the food taste and freshness isn't what it was. I have been coming pretty much once or twice a month the past four months and it has been a steady and continual decline. Also, the cleanliness of the restaurant seems to be dropping.  Its too bad since the concept of a vegetarian dim sum is great.


Initial review:
I have been to dim sum probably over 1,000 times in my life...seriously. So when my wife told me about the vegetarian dim sum at Wu Tai, I was skeptical. Is it dim sum without chicken feet?

But this place has changed my perspective about vegetarian food and the idea of meat in dim sum. The food here tastes great regardless of meat or not. You are sacrificing zero flavour. In fact, I think I prefer some of the veg versions. Sometimes meat is just thrown into a dish without adding anything in terms of flavour at regular dim sum.

Plus it isn't that expensive here and they have weekday early bird specials. 

Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"A great place for vegetarian food. I am a regular meat eater and I did not imagine vegetarian food can taste this good. 

The interior is well maintained and looks very decent and the service was excellent.

There is a lot of detail in the use of utensils to even the napkins with beautiful napkin. 

One of the few Chinese restaurants I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"So amid looking at new vegetarian restaurants to try, I stumbled across this place. It was opened (silently) last month, so I figured a lot of the early mishaps would've cleared by then.

Upon entry, I noticed this place was a little smaller than I thought. Turns out there's actually a closed off VIP section to the right of the restaurant. Aside from that the decorations are your typical buddhist style (but no monk surprisingly), as well as two separate washrooms (one for each gender).

The menu, as explained already, has standard Chinese dishes and some unique dishes. Some recommendations include turnip cake (one of the BEST I've had!), mushroom tart, fried tofu, miso turnip (with a bunch of other stuff), and the \"fake shrimp\" dumplings. I do not recommend the siu mai, as it's not what you will expect from a vegetarian siu mai (basically the meat is replaced with rice).

Service was overall very good, although one of the waiters didn't know what \"mustard\" was. Oh well.

Will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is not vegan! I know the name says 'vegetarian' - however, most 'vegetarian' restaurants are in fact vegan. I use to dine here quit often, and have asked the server many times, if their food contains dairy, and they said no. Fast forward to a couple of hours earlier, when I was dining at their restaurant, I see cheese and mayo in their dishes! WTF?! I confronted the server about it, and she said some of their dishes does in fact contain dairy, and she looked at me like 'is there a problem?'. I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"The food is good but I have to be honest, I can taste a lot of MSG in it. The service is good. I came back for a few times already and I would've given this place a 5 stars but recently they stopped having early bird discount on Saturdays and Sundays. They didn't mention this change on the menu so we didn't know until we got the bill in the end. All the tables around us were unaware of this change as well. I would've been fine if they noted this on the menu or had a sign to notify the customers so I feel like I got TRICKED. Be careful if you come here for early bird dim sum because there is NO MORE EARLY BIRD DISCOUNT ON WEEKEND."}
{"text":"Yay! There's another vegetarian restaurant in Markham! 

It looks like a typical Chinese banquet hall, yet it's fancy for a vegetarian hang-out. Lots of chandeliers, tablecloths and bright lights; there are also private rooms for special gatherings. This restaurant is associated with one of the Buddhist temples in Markham, as you can tell by the slew of pamphlets lining the foyer. 

The menu has standard Chinese dishes, which won't scare away the omnivore uncles, aunties and cousins. We started with a traditional thick soup or 'gung', with lots of tofu and noodles. The fried tofu is beautifully batter and the accompanying sauce is good enough to sip (or drink, if you're gluttonous like me). We also had sweet and sour vegetables with fried wonton wraps; not healthy in the least, but a common dish that will easily please the crowds. There are a wide range of e-fu noodles; the version with braised eggplant was nicely done without being too salty. The fried rice was pretty solid and had lots of mushrooms to give it texture.

Unfortunately, they did not have desserts available when we visited. I hope they change this soon!

4/5 stars"}
{"text":"We came here for dimsum on a Saturday morning surprised to see that it was empty.. Turns out they open at 10:30am and the early bird dimsum special is until noon.... $2.80 per item. 

There was a wide variety of your classic dimsum choices in vegetarian versions.. Very interesting! The presentation of all the food was appealing. 

My only problem is that I found it to be quite greasy and filling as it is mostly carbs/bean curd to substitute for many meat options."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..

Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..

Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.

Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.

Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!! 

Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..

I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood.. 

But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.

Even though it's not my cup of tea, I believe this place deserves 4 stars"}
{"text":"Well presented and adapted Chinese food. Tastes authenticly Chinese, even though no meat is used. 

Really liked the pumpkin congee soup. Smooth with just a hint of pumpkin. Classy atmosphere. Clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Horrible Service, Manager was extremely arrogant and rude. No paying customer should be treated so poorly by the Manager of the restaurant. The food was greasy and overpriced. For a vegetarian restaurant, the food was anything but healthy. It should be illegal for them to borrow the name of Mount Wutai - they are a misrepresentation to the name and to authentic vegetarian Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"FOOD was ok. We had the eggplant e-fu noodles which were very tasty - a bit spicy and savoury. The crispy veg with mixed veg was just OK. We got tea and a coke. I used a groupon ($15 for $30) and still needed to add $12 on top of the bill. So I feel like I paid a lot for just OK chinese food. 
SERVICE really ruined the experience. We didn't get our 2nd dish until way after the first. Every time we'd try to get someone's attention we were ignored while we saw others getting served. Same thing happened again at the end of the meal when we wanted to get a doggie bag and the bill.
BOTTOM LINE - We won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really are vegetarian - in that case there aren't as many dining options, I guess; and I hope you end up here at a time with better servers. I think the dim sum items people yelped about look really interesting. I wish we'd gone for dim sum instead of dinner. Unfortunately we probably won't return based on this dinner experience."}
{"text":"We have always loved this place.

Vegetarian fine Chinese (Cantonese) fare.  Meticulously prepared and exquisitely presented.  Personable and capable wait staff.  Ask for the juhua cha (chrysanthamum tea) to round off your meal and to sip during.

Pumpkin and ginko-nut congee    5/5
Taofu-pi rolls 5/5
Lotus and black fungus mushroom 4/5
Crystal veg. dumplings  3.5/5

Great place ... nice clientele.  Always leave happy."}
{"text":"Got here around 10:30 am for a table of 4 people and we were excited to try this vegetarian dim sum restaurant! We noticed the place was half full. Seemed like it was not a good sign, but then after 11:30am, a huge line was forming! Kind of odd since this place has a $2.88 (S, M, L) special if you place your order before 12:00pm. Also, the $2.88 special is cash only.

We ordered 8 dimsum dishes and 1 chef special item. The food was tasty, and steadily reached our table in a timely manner. At the beginning of our meal servers were attentive and refilled out teapots with hot water. However when it got closer to noon, we couldn`t find anyone who could get our bill, or some take away boxes. The place seemed a bit understaffed when it was a full house. 

I really liked the fried taro dumplings, the pumpkin fried rice balls, and the soft cake layered with mango sauce. The lohan vegetarian fried noodles ($16 - yikes...!) never made it to our table until we asked one of the passing by servers. It was totally forgotten. It got to our table eventually, but I really wanted to try that dish earlier in my meal, in the end we had to pack it to go for takeout. Even though we had not eaten the lohan noodles during our meal, we were so stuffed from the 8 dimsum items that we ordered."}
{"text":"We bought the coupon from webook

Food: the menu is nice but the food are not look the picture on the menu; taste is 3/5
Price: vegetarian places cost more than regular places; other vegetarian restaurants serve fake meat made of bean curd, however, this place is all about vegetables, mushroom and tofu. The price is too much for a plate of vegetables.
Service: service is slow but friendly"}
{"text":"wu tai vegetarian restaurant - First we looked at the menu and the portion size looked relatively small. So we decided to order a 4 person meal for 3 people which was $88. The staff warned us the portion sizes of the dishes that we might not be able to finish and they weren't kidding about it; we ended up bringing a good portion of food home. 

I would say their food is very unique and they are not just healthy, they taste good as well. Our food was arrived pretty fast, and the staff only brought us additional dishes after we finish a dish.

I love the modern interior of the restaurant, it is very clean, spacious and bright which you cannot tell just be looking at the exterior of the restaurant. I would recommend it to vegetarians to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Lots of MSG. The food tasted good and service was excellent but by the time I got home, I was just drinking water to wash out the msg in my system. We purchased a coupon to eat here. For $30 you get $60 worth of food. It's a super good deal and a good experience as well because the servers were super nice. I actually really liked the imitation of sweet and sour pork. The pork was substituted with mushroom....so clever!! I would recommend this dish if you are going to try out some vegetarian food.

I'm undecided if I want to return because of the MSG, but service was exceptional. The interior design for this place is also super nice. So if you want to impress your relatives or your in-laws who are vegetarian, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Food is average, but the service is not up to par.  We went for dim sum and ordered about 30 dishes.  we made a mistake of ordering an repeated item because of we offer two rounds.  
We simply asked for changing another item, manager wouldn't and keep reasoning with us and give us an very bad altitude.  Maybe he is having a bad day, but this is not right way to treat customers.

Won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Calling all dim sum lovers, Wu tai has the best vegetarian dim sum in town!  Full disclosure: this is my first time going to a vegetarian dim sum restaurant so I have nothing to compare to but it's damn good. 

I love variety when it come to food. Just like regular dim sum, the order sheet listed over 30 items. You can choose from steamed dishes like shrimp dumpling and Sui mai, deep fried/pan fried and baked items. Between the two of us, we ordered 9 items including a large size noodle ($15) and the bill was around $70 (all in) which isn't bad.  Every dish uses only veggie to imitate the meat equivalent dim sum, super creative and delicious. 

This was very refreshing experience and I didn't even crave meat the entire time! Wu tai is a game changer, I will be eating my greens more often here going forward."}
{"text":"My Favourite dim sum place. All their dim sum is good but my favourite is the mushroom cheese tarts. The restaurant is very clean and elegantly decorated. I like how they don't use the mock meats in their dishes. Truly vegetarian. and being a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant no garlic or onions are used as well."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but they have some pretty good food. My favourite is the potato stuffed eggplant"}
{"text":"Thought I wrote a review before but maybe not. Anyways probably would have given a 4 two years ago but today wanted to update my review (if I had one). The last two times the quality of the food was slipping and also on top f the still very slow cooks waiting for 30+ minutes for food after ordering, this has to go down to a 2 / 3.

They do have Groupon specials which gives it a more reasonable price. Still have special selection for vegetarian compared to other veggie places. However today they served some pretty poor quality food and the floor manager wanted to give us a 10% off the next time. The veggies were rotting and black and served to us. In the end they gave in another order of the same thing and in the end after 30 min it ended up being the same. 

Maybe this is just 1 bad experience as I have been here probably 15 plus times but from when I first came here the food quality is just not cutting it for the price you pay.

This was for their dinner service. Usually the dim sum is not bad and haven't had a bad experience yet for dim sum. But their dinner service is slow and now quality is just Meh. 

If you are a vegetarian I would still give this place a try but I'll be out looking for alternatives now."}
{"text":"I always come here for dinner with the fam!

First of all, the service is quite nice because the lady that was serving us was super smiley and friendly! She was also quick and efficient!~ 

I love how this restaurant makes very unique vegetarian dishes that are innovative and yummy! My personal favourite is the lotus root glutinous rice wrapped in bean curd! SO. GOOD. Definitely a must try for everyone!

Everything else was pretty good, I really like the fried milk as well however, I noticed that they use a lot of oil in all their dishes, so for people who can't eat greasy foods, BEWARE!

The soup was just a-ok, the purple sweet potato soup didn't taste like sweet potato at all, just tasted salty :$ Would not order again.

Other than that I actually really like this restaurant and I'll be coming again during lunch time to try their dim sum!~"}
{"text":"Decor was nice- a bit fancy. Service was okay/good. Food came quickly- it was half full on a Saturday evening. We've come here once before for dinner and it was OK, so we decided to give it another try. We left still feeling like it was just OK. A bit pricey for what we got- lots of tofu, mushroom, and very breaded fried stuff. Most dishes were rather greasy. Overall we'd say it's a good place to go if you're in the area and/or can't think of another vegetarian place to go to."}
{"text":"I didn't have much of an expectation when I walked into Wu Tai, though I wished it was an awesome find because it's so close to work.

My boyfriend and I ordered 6 dishes and overall they were not bad. Our favourite was their mini mushroom pie which has good chunks of mushrooms in it, their take on shui mai which was stuffed with glutinous rice, and their rice rolls were pretty good too (tho a tad oily for me). The pan fried taro was ok, just like your turnip cake but with carrots and taro. Our least favourite was their corn balls with tofu, the steamed tofu was flavourless and the corn balls were flavourless mush.

We would go back because we love that it was not as noisy as your typical dim sum place, and the service was really really good. Alex the manager was pretty much on a marathon, making his rounds constantly and making sure everything was in order (empty dishes cleaned and tea refilled). 

I will definitely be back because of the great service I had!"}
{"text":"Even though Wu Tai did not meet my personal expectations, I found their congee quite good, especially the pumpkin gingko version.  You also get a much better value compared to Graceful Vege (even though Graceful offers a more refined vegan experience).  My suggestion:  after many meals of heavy protein at all the wonderful eateries nearby, hop in here once a week to do a system cleanse w/ plenty of veggies and mushrooms finished w/ a bowl of their congee to wash it all down."}
{"text":"I stopped by Wu Tai for dinner once and ordered the Eggplant Stir Fried E-fu Noodles. The price was a little high, but the portion was huge, as this seems to be a family style restaurant so it's a little bit hard to order for one. I had enough for another full meal the next day and really enjoyed the flavours. I would like to come back but bring some dining guests with me to try out more of their delicious food. I believe they only have a lot of their savoury pies/tarts for lunch and not dinner as I asked about them and they said it wasn't available."}
{"text":"This review is based on the day time dim sum experience.

Wu Tai is an excellent place to have a meal with my vegetarian friends. Just love that we can all eat everything and anything off the menu.

We tried quite a few dishes:

Sticky Rice Siu Mai ($3.20) - Meh

Mushroom Veggie Dumpling ($3.20) - A-OK

Rice Wrap in Lotus Leaf ($4.20) -A-OK

Steam Eggplant & Mushroom ($4.20) - Hate it! Just taste grassy and blend

Fungus Dumpling Hai Gaw ($4.20) - A-OK

Steamed Luffa Rice Roll ($3.20) - Excellent

Deep Fried Lotus Cake with Sticky Rice ($6.50) - Batter is way too heavy... Meh

Baked Almond Pudding ($3.20) - Freshly grounded almond and served right from the oven! I love that!

Layers Cake with Nuts ($4.20) - A-OK

I notice that most of the dishes are not oily at all. The taste is really delicate and clean. I also enjoy the fact that they not trying to make their dim sum to be the look alike of their non veggie version.

The deco is classy and the space is spacious! The restaurant was not busy at all when I visited and the vibe is really calm and zen. Servers are all really friendly and nice.

I will definitely be back if I am dining with my vegetarian friends. The price is on the pricier side, but Wu Tai definitely provides a great and refine vegetarian dining experience!"}
{"text":"The waitress here was very friendly and since she knew I studied in Guangzhou we have chatted a lot. The dishes here were yummy but a little oily. Overall it's a good vegetarian restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum & quite enjoyed it. The vegetarian dim sum here is better than most non-vegetarian dim sum I've had in Toronto, in terms of quality of preparation and execution. Wutai makes some very nice vegetarian renditions of classic dim sum that are good enough that omnivores won't miss having meat. 

Wutai has an early bird special on dim sum orders made before 12 pm; Medium and Large dishes (regularly $3.75 and $4.75) are priced like they're Small ($2.98 each). There is a $1.20 per person fee for tea and sauce.

Summary of dim sum I tried [I use ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star. So, ***^ means 3.5 stars]:

***** Steamed Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was one of my faves here. I'm not sure what the filling was in the middle of the perfectly textured fragrant sticky rice but it was very flavourful.
****^ Steamed Pea sprouts rice roll was great. The rice roll was perfectly steamed and soft. The pea sprouts filling was flavourful. 
**** Fried taro dumpling was very good, crispy on the outside, soft taro next and a creamy veg filling in the centre.
***^ Steamed \"Cordyceps flowers and wolfberry\" dumpling was okay, but not my fave. The sweetness in the flavours didn't balance well for me.
*** Steamed Tofu skin roll was solid, fairly standard for this dish. 
*** Baked mushroom tart was all right but nothing special. The mushroom was flavourful, but the pastry part was heavy and flour-y rather than light.
**^ Steamed Mushroom and vegetable in tofu sachet was okay but bland. Tofu sachet was spongey -- if it'd been flavourful, this would be fine, but unfortunately it wasn't appropriately seasoned.
** Fried tofu skin roll with homemade sauce (deep fried) was disappointing. It was crispy on the outermost layer, but then the next layer was rather tough & difficult to bite through. It seems like this layer should either have been fried so it was crispier or softer so teeth can bite through it. 

Service was good; our waiter was eager to help. Restaurant is comfortable.
 
I'd happily return for dim sum and would be curious to try their dinner."}
{"text":"This review is for the dinner menu.

Two words: bland & greasy.

By bland, I mean lacking in basic seasoning. Like, salt and pepper. 

And this might be vegetarian, but it definitely ain't health food. Like actually, don't kid yourselves people.

Copious amounts of oil are used and there is a heavy reliance on deep frying and pan frying. Honestly, as someone who really likes fried food, I found the the taste and texture of these dishes off-putting. 

You can only eat so many mushrooms before you realize you're just eating mushrooms.

tl;dr - You won't need your Chapstick after this meal. 

Admittedly, I am curious about the dim-sum."}
{"text":"Came here a while back with family. Food was expensive, greasy, and bland. Portions were very small too. 
Likely won't come back here"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner... i will keep it short.

It is expensive yes.  they spent a lot on renovation... its definately on the higher end side of Chinese dining.

I have been to a few vegetarian restaurants and usually portions are small.
I was shocked to see that the portions were large here.  Presentation is nice and most of all service was very attentive and proper.  

it felt very unusual because i am use to asian places with crappy service.  

with typical vegetarian places serving \"mock meats\"  the waitress told us that they do not do this.. and that there are no simulated meats here.. instead, they use vegetarian options and create whole new unique dishes.

i did find it a bit oily.  taste was a tad bland for my liking...  overall.. 3/5 due to the high prices.."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot as I found their dishes were less salty and oily compare to other Chinese restaurant. However I was very disappointed when I went there for dim sum recently. The dim sum menu has very limited selections, I remember they used to have more unique dim sum dishes. And we ordered the fried rice with avocado. It used to be one of their best dishes. It tasted okay;however, the avocado was rotten and they looked blackish but they put quite a lot in to the rice. The fried rice was 20 dollars and consider how cheap avocado is and they rather sacrifice the food quality to save cost.

The other dishes we got were either too salty or greasy...

Summary: Overpriced for average quality of food. Although the seating is comfortable, I will probably not go back. Don't waster your money there. You are better off go to a regular Chinese restaurant and order vegetable dishes for half of the price."}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon. will be coming back again and try a few other dishes. eggplant efu noodles was the star this time but I want to try some other dishes we wanted to try but couldn't because we were so full"}
{"text":"WuTai is usually the first place that pops to mind when I am in the mood for vegetarian Chinese food. Given that it is associated with the Cham Shan Buddhist Temple, not only is the restaurant meat-free, the five pungent vegetables (onions, garlic, chives, green onions and leeks) are also excluded from the menu. Despite all these dietary restrictions, there is still quite an extensive (not to mention, delicious) menu.

Tonight, we opted to get the Dinner for Four ($88) and added on a Steamed Whole Eggplant with Black Bean Sauce ($19.99). The set dinner had seven different dishes plus dessert which was a steal given that there is an extra 10% off when you pay with cash.

The course of the night would have to be the Pumpkin and Corn Soup. The soup was thick and hearty and extremely flavourful. I loved that they had tulipbulbs in the soup which added a sweet milky flavour and a crisp texture. I thought it was a brilliant idea and will have to start incorporating those bulbs into my own soups at home!

The Marinated Tofu, Tofu Skin and Sweet and Sour Gluten is another favourite as is the Braised Mushrooms with Greens. The Avocado and Truffle Fried Rice is aromatic and filled with yummy goodness such as veggies and mushrooms. I was also really glad we added on the eggplant as it was cooked to a perfectly so that it was soft but not mushy. The blackbean sauce added to it was really tasty.

I've always said, if all vegetarian food was as good as it is at WuTai, I could easily go meatless!"}
{"text":"I have gone a few times for dinner but never tried the dim sum lunch.

Like someone mentioned, I was not a fan of the names of the menu items. They were too hard to remember and did not describe the dish well enough. 

There seems to be an abundance of dishes with mushroom in them which is great if you want mushrooms with everything. However, if you have a 10 person table, it could be frustrating when you see 5 or 6 out of the 8 dishes you ordered have mushrooms which take up half the dish. Overall I did not like the food variety, but I understand that vegetarian restaurants have to be more limited in variety.

Food quality varies by dish but for the most part it's above average quality.

The service you get is what you pay for. All of my friends thought the prices were reasonable. Waiters are attentive and polite.

The dessert is subject to availability but they have two options for traditional Chinese dessert (both hot). I would highly recommend anyone who is a sweet tooth to give them a try as they were the highlight of my meal. They were also easily the cheapest item you can order (besides plain rice) and were well worth the money.

3.5 stars. I have a hard time wanting to go back for dinner because as mentioned above, I really don't like a lot of the menu. Of course it all comes down to the individual's taste buds."}
