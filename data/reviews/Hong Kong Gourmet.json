{"text":"Love this place!! Amazing food and great portions. It's not your typical \"dine in\" tho. Pretty sketchy when you go in. But worth it I promise you"}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ spare ribs, crispy salt and pepper shrimps, and an egg roll for delivery. 1. Additional menu descriptions would be helpful. 2. I placed my order through just-eats.ca, they estimated 40 mins - it took 1 hr 10 mins. 3. The \"crispy\" shrimp arrived soggy - a larger vent hole in the container could help. I was hoping for a crispy shell on shrimp, but alas, no shell :( The flavour was reasonably good - the menu says they're spicy - I say not. 4. The egg roll was crispy, typical, adequate. 5. The BBQ spare ribs (long) - were very saucy, probably to hide the fact that many of the ribs were hard, burnt and inedible. I wouldn't order from them again."}
{"text":"Their food is soooo yummy and their meat is good quality, the portions are huge! However... they have significantly increased their prices and seem to be the highest cost Chinese takeout I've really ever seen in the suburbs. It's too bad, cause this was my favourite Chinese place to order from... hopefully the owners see this, and can at least offer some discounts here and there."}
{"text":"Ordered at 9:50pm Sunday March 20th. It was the worst chinese food I had ever delivered to me. The chicken balls & wings were over cooked to the point of a very dark brown yet inside was barely warm... The Beef with Brockley looked and tasted like it was microwaved; yes it was that bad. I put it in the garbage.   I called and spoke to the manager, his exact and only response was, \"are you sure..\" Sir, \"is this post sure enough for you?\""}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I ever had. Too much salt, both in the noodles and in the chicken. There was hardly any meat under the hugely breaded chilly chicken. I would've given a minus 2 star, if there was an option."}
{"text":"It's your classic Chinese food for white people. Serving size is large food is good.  Price is reasonable  Staff are always friendly Walk in tends to be faster than delivery"}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese place in the neighbourhood and my go to dish is their General Tao chicken - it's crispy and full of flavor without being too greasy. Also, unlike other Chinese spots, it seems like their General Tao has a lot more protein and less flour/fillers. Their Ginger Beef is also good but eat it while it's hot otherwise it will get hard and chewy."}
{"text":"Shitty tables but let me tell you the food is so delicious. No they don't have authentic Chinese food like in Chinatown but if you want canadian Chinese, this is the place to go. Try the sweet and sour pork. Restaurants usually run this dish by using the crappiest cuts of pork with the nubs and cartilage on it. This place transforms the dish into hot succulent candy."}
{"text":"The prices are good for what you get but the food itself doesnt taste great..chicken doesnt taste fresh and is really crunchy which is kind of skeptical and the rice was nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is basically a take out or delivery kind of place.  There are like maybe 2 tables in the place and I've never eaten in but if you do it's probably still served to you in the take out container.    I go to this restaurant for take out maybe 2 to 3 times a month mostly during the week.  I either get a combo like #4 or #6 with or without a noodle dish like pad thai, beef w rice noodles, cantonese chow mein etc.    Their combos are HUGE.  Normally if I order 2 dishes it takes me alone maybe 3 meals to consume all of it and that will run something like 15 to 18 bucks for 2 dishes.  The food is very affordable for the portions that you get.  A single combo like #6 is basically a meal 2 adults can split.  It's sweet and sour chicken (not chicken balls, but chicken), mixed vegetables with beef slices, fried rice and an eggroll.  This combo after tax is not even 8 dollars.    Like I said it's affordable and you get a lot of food for the money.  Now the food is average to above average as far as quality but the portions more than make up for it.  I've been going Golden Wok just down the street since I was a child but I find myself going to HKG more often now probably because I can eat dinner and have enough for lunch the next day and it's a good value.  Edit:  12/04/2014. Upgraded to 4 stars from previously 3. I didn't want to write an update because the last one I updated all my photos stopped being associated with my review. Reason for upgrade to 4 stars is because the quality is good and the consistency for quantity has not changed. I've been going here regularly now for some time and they are the best Chinese place in the area hands down."}
{"text":"This is your typical Chinese take-out restaurant. Fast, cheap and huge portions. I choose to come here because 1) I'm addicted to their chili chicken and 2) the staff is very nice and polite which is not something you see often at Chinese places"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3.5 stars for value for the money.  I brought a colleague from Hong Kong to have a quick dinner inside as I have driven past this place numerous times and thought it would be a good time to introduce ourselves and try what we call \"Canadian Chinese Food\".  They say Hong Kong and part of this is true but the chefs are from Shanghai and the lovely lady we met is from Chengdu.  If you know your Chinese cuisine then you'll realize the food they cook is what they think westerners will like.  So if you want Authentic real Chinese food you might have to ask specifically for it.  An example most westerners haven't had \"real\" Szechuan style \"ma laht \" MA PO TOFU!  Which happens to be my favourite!  So if you want to be adventurous and you think you can handle it, you can ask for it.  \"I would like to try the REAL \"CHENGDU\" MA PO TOFU! \".  Say it!  I don't think you will.  So maybe just order the General Tso 's Chicken.   Funny how we came for Canadianized Chinese food and I informed my colleague some history on how this type of Chinese food evolved from the late 1800's to present.  Evolving from Toisan and Jungsan province area early settlers into Canada.   The staff here are nice.  We had a nice chat and I want to come again on another trip.  I really enjoy making the connection from the food to the personalities behind their creations.  The how's and why's in what they do.   This place certainly caught my attention and I'm glad I came in.  Now for the food! Spicy chicken wings - wow we got a lot of wings!  Liked the spicy fried toppings which also go very well with squid and tofu !  The Wonton soup was surprisingly very Canadian Chinese Old school.  Not the shrimp versions that is so popular from Hong Kong and a real throwback to the 60's and 70's.  My colleague had never tried this version in Hong Kong from the soup base to the Wonton.   The Singapore Vermicelli has a bit of spice but wasn't as curried as Chinese versions.  We think they modified to customers tastes.  It was like a \"lite\" version of the original.   Got an order of mushroom fried rice which was a good base for the Ma Po Tofu.  The deep rich dark red sauce was actually flavourful.  Again my colleague mentioned he never had a dish like this where the tofu didn't absorb the sauce and he kinda liked it!    But for me, I really wanted her authentic version of this dish and I'm thinking I will have to ask for it next time.    So if you come and are a regular.  Drop in and introduce yourself and ask if they can make an authentic real version of their dish.  They might just make it for you!  You may really end up liking the real thing too.   But for me.  As it is, I like what I saw and I will come back and continue from where I left off."}
{"text":"Found this place searching for cantonese style food in the etobicoke/mississauga area and ordered off the just-eat menu for 6, very nice selection and all the dishes delicious and well prepared. Family is very friendly and it's a cute establishment. Happy to have found them."}
{"text":"My husband and I know our Chinese Take-out. Yep, this place delivered on taste, portions, price and service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just your typical Chinese takeout place..recently ordered for delivery for the first time from them and was pleased how each food we got was plentiful and tasted your typical good. They really didn't skimp out on the ingredients so thats a plus.. since most places would get cheap on your food regardless of the price you paid for.   Their service was very prompt and there was no issues on the delivery. The driver was considerate and nice.  Overall, yes.. I do recommend trying them out if you live within the Mississauga boundaries."}
{"text":"Excellent food at reasonable prices. My grandchildren and I found it online and have been  there three times now. The dumplings , Shanghai noodles and lemon chicken are our favourites so far.   Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best American Chinese food in Etobicoke. Expect to wait a long time for takeout or delivery. Call way ahead it's a fairly popular place due to quality and price."}
{"text":"I had to stop in at the No Frills after work and, when I was going back to my car, all I could smell was Chinese food cooking and calling my name. They seemed to be pretty busy taking delivery orders, which was a good sign for me. The menu was extensive but I decided just to order the char siu (pork) fried rice. I only waited about 10 minutes and then the nice lady behind the counter gave me my order.  The serving was massive and, to my surprise, I was actually pretty impressed. The rice had texture, not too much soy and generous amounts of barbecue pork. I ate about a fourth of it and didn't feel any MSG bloat or thirst after.  Since it's on my new route home, I plan to visit again and maybe try something else - will post more pics then."}
{"text":"This place is rude and unprofessional there food is soggy and inedible    Also if you don't give s big enough tip they hang out infront of your house screaming at you."}
{"text":"Needs better decor but food is great for the price.   I ordered the number 4 special for lunch. Comes with an egg roll, beef/vegetables, fried rice and spare ribs. Portions are huge and the price is not bad for what you get. Roughly, I spent $10 with a drink. Rice was my favourite part, egg roll seemed like it was from frozen but otherwise you taste what you asked for."}
{"text":"WHAT?!? How have I not reviewed this place I could have sworn I did but that's ok I shall launch into this review now with all the more exuberance  Located in Renforth plaza on Renforth dr and Rathburn rd nestled away with the existing shops, many of which have been there since I was a child. The restaurant is more of a takeout location with only 2 or 3 tables and an extremely barren design concept but what they lack in aesthetic they more then make up for with delicious food and good service.  I have been ordering here for years and have always been a fan of this place so that's why I am extra confused how I managed to not review them?! For the most part I mainly ordered takeout and they were always very accommodating when I was having buzzer issues so any delivery people would always have to call and many did not like this. I guess I can understand how it might make a new delivery guy a little nervous to have to wait downstairs in the lobby for money but come on after a dozen times you'd think they would eventually figure it out. But I never had problems with Honk Kong Gourmet, their drivers were calm, relaxed and very polite when they buzzed and were always super appreciative of any tip I gave them, mind you I always gave them a decent tip because I appreciated their great service but they were always super friendly and nice people that clearly went the extra mile. One time my elevator was out and instead of waiting downstairs they literally took the stairs all the way up and it was a fair few floors so these guys and gals always impressed me.  I tend to be a stickler for consistency and I have never really been disappointed with the food here, the quality is always on par and the price especially for the quantity is very affordable. Some of my favorite dishes here include:  Spicy Peanut chicken: The chicken is all white meat, breaded and deep fried to golden perfection and you get a heaping pile of it with a side of spicy peanut sauce that is savory with a tad bit of heat.   Cantonese Chow Mein w/ crispy noodles: Everyone knows this dish but I find this place is one of the best I have tried as the noodles stay crispy even after delivered and the ingredients are always fresh and tasty.  Szechuan Mix Vegetables: This dish you can get as spicy as you like, I ask for a mild spice because not everyone in my family likes the heat but the mild spice still gives it a bit of a kick and loads of flavor.  I am also a fan of their combo plates and dinners, given they are the traditional selection of basic dishes but they are very affordable and come in a fair size portion too. The plate dinners are under $10 a plate... around $6.50 I believe and that is a very affordable option and of course the food is delish so its well worth it.   If your craving some delicious Chinese food and your in the neighborhood do stop by and check these guys out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had take out today. The portions are huge and food quality is average. The specials with pictures are facing outside but would also be helpful for them to be on the inside as well. I would go back."}
