{"text":"Wow! This place has the best chilli garlic eggplant - ever! And the Spicy fish?! ZOMG!
A Chinese friend recommended this place and when we went we were the only non-Asians in the restaurant.
The quantities are huge and the prices are affordable.
Will be going back many many times!"}
{"text":"They only take payment by Cash or MasterCard.
The menu is vast, the wait staff is friendly, the service is quick and the food is delicious.  The atmosphere is very calming after stepping in from the 'crazy' of Chinatown."}
{"text":"Enter: Sichuan Garden. Through the green doors, and over a bridge (!?) into a rather bare-bones establishment. From the looks of it, in another life, Sichuan Garden was once a club of some kind. I judge this from the 'bar' area where the cash register is, above which is a ceiling where a light-cover in the shape of stars is attached. Some 90s-riffic starlight action went down here, no doubt.

The service... both times I have visited, we were served by the same waiter, who treated us very decently, and seemed to believe us when we requested they, 'Bring on the spice!' He was even able to give us a hand when we described a favourite dish or ours-- he made it happen. 

My favourite dish, ma po tofu, was very good. I recommend that one, for sure. I wouldn't bother with the dandan mian... basically nothingness (but, cheap). 

Three stars because they charged $1.50 for a single bowl of rice (is the standing rule that you get charged if your skin is the same colour as the starch?)"}
{"text":"The price was reasonable. And the food was so nice! A good place for people who love spicy and hot! Try Dan Dan noodles, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Nice environment. I like their crispy pork intestine , and the wonton in chili oil is pretty authentic too. I can't tell the difference between the one I had in chengdu and here. Service is good in terms of Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"The lunch special is too die for. 4.99 set meals with a wide variety is good but I would only make it out for lunch"}
{"text":"The prices in this restaurant are very reasonable... Yet it is probably one of the best Szechuan restaurant in Toronto. Dan dan mien is one of the best I had in Toronto. 
I will definitely return to this restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"I ordered the Dan Dan noodle finally.
After watching that Japanese show I was eager to try the authentic Dan Dan noodle.
I have never eat Sichuan food or spicy dishes before, but this time I finished the whole dish. 
It was really really spicy for me. Tongue thumbing but I can't stop. 
Fantastic experience for me.
But since I haven't been to any Sichuan restaurant before, so this review may be subjective."}
{"text":"I wish I can give 0 star, service is rude, they can't be the waiters, the beef and soup are completely flavorless, surcharge for tips, can't be a restaurant. Too much oil and worst meal ever. Do not eat in chinatown, cheating and bad beyond imagination."}
{"text":"Portion is huge, personally I feel the food is not spicy enough, but it is alright. Service is nice as well, the one served me was nice enough to suggest small portion as It was obviously my first time there and unfamiliar with their serving size."}
{"text":"You want some authentic Szechuan food? Come to this place. Probably the best Szechuan food I've had in Toronto. The lunch specials are amazing; cheap and so yummy! Their Kung Pao chicken is a must order!"}
{"text":"I was walking by and decided to stop by to eat lunch in this place. When I first walked into this place there were no customers... a bit weird. I guess I came early. It is a big place. The decor was not that nice looking. They had a fountian near the door that was all dry.

The food was good!!! Much better than I thought it would be. I am glad I went  there. I would go back if I was in the area. Yeh for yummy food!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal here last week. The staff was very friendly. 

The food was excellent, the most authentic Sichuan food I have eaten since moving back from china. 

My personal favorites are ?????kung pow chicken. ?????spicy cabbage dish. And ?????eggplant is some delicious sauce. Classic Chinese dishes but also some of the most appealing to the western palette. Definitely worth the try. 

Take note they DO NOT TAKE VISA!!! I know other people said this already. But a couple people were having this problem when we were getting out bill."}
{"text":"Short Version is:

They take MasterCard, not Visa, but always bring cash just in case.

For native people, I recommend hot and sour sweet potato noodle, hot oil dumpling( hong you chao shou), double cooked pork( this quality is a bit inconsistent), suan dou jiao chao rou mo (the best)

For others, kong pao chicken

Go for lunches, they have great lunch special combos, very good prices.

I don't like their dishes involving spicy pungent sauce, but it's a long time since last time I tried them so I don't know if there is any improvement on these dishes.



PS. I consider myself a pretty native Sichuanese, reason is my parent were both born and raised in sichuan, I was born and raised in sichuan till I was 5 and I used to go back sichuan every 1 or 2 years till I turned 18 and got sent to Canada.

Since I live Downtown Toronto, I used to go to this place when I misses home, back then, Sichuan House does not exist and i haven't visited Hot spicy spicy. Now I have more options, other options like Sichuan house, hot spicy spicy are all pretty authentic, they taste different coz the chefs are from different part of China, for example, hot spicy spicy is Chongqing style, it's a city got separated from Sichuan Province and now it is directly controlled by Beijing, the capital city of China.

And I got a feeling the chef at this place is from Chengdu. But I maybe wrong. lol."}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant has that 1980's Chinatown signage.  I'm not sure how long this restaurant has been around, but the fluorescent light that shines in the front window isn't the most welcoming fixture.  Nor does it really show you just how big this restaurant is on the inside.

When I walked in that weekday night, it looked rather empty.  But then I noticed the two large tables at the back filled with a party.  I decided this restaurant might not be so bad after all.

Meeting my colleague, our goal that night was to work on research for our documentary - The Foodist Monk: Sichuan in Chengdu.  With that in mind we ordered enough food for four people, even though it was just the two of us.  Speaking to the waiter in English, we asked which dishes were the Sichuan specific meals.  So many Chinese restaurants in Toronto have a a melange of different regions, we wanted to only taste the Sichuan specialties.  We were pointed to the first page which had about 20 dishes to choose from.  

From the first page  we decided on a number of the different dishes:

- Sliced Beef Sichuan Style (cold style beef - we were warned by our server)
- Sichuan Style Shrimp (with the heads on - we were warned by our server)
- Mapo Tofu
- Dan Dan Noodles

We also added to the selection a vegetable dish of snow pea greens with garlic.  This acts as a palate cleanser.  Perfect for soaking up any of the saucy deliciousness of the other dishes.

And of course to wash it all down, Chinese beer (Tsing Tao) makes this a complete meal.

The dishes came together in no particular order.  And as we discussed our work on the documentary together and how each of these dishes would inform us, we found that the beef isn't your average slices of flank steak.  It was actually beef tongue, and tendons.  Which to our Chinese palate wasn't a surprise but might have been to others since it's not labeled as such.

The Mapo Tofu isn't as spicy as some we've each had before.  My colleague did mention that the spice on it is different in Sichuan than what we were tasting.  The spice on this tofu was definitely a certain kind of red chili - in fact a kitchen staff member walked by with a giant basket full of flat dried red chilies while we were eating.

Dan Dan Mien is deceptively bland, until you mix the sauce which sits beneath the noodles. As you mix, the flavour explodes onto your plate and then into your mouth with every bite.

The last to arrive was the Sichuan Shrimp.  This was a dish that suddenly brought back fond memories of Chinese New Year passed - a favourite dish that my mother made. This Sichuan Shrimp was definitely flavourful - a little messy as you ripped the heads off the body and sucked the sauce off the shells of the shrimp and devoured every morsel from inside the shells.

Every dish gave us a satisfying flavour of Sichuan cuisine.  I think though that we will keep searching for other varying takes on the regional menu, perhaps trying some of the newer venues in Richmond Hill or Markham.  But for an old-school Chinese restaurant in Toronto Chinatown, this place is definitely worth a try for those who enjoy lots of flavour, with a sweet spicy range in their Chinese cuisine.  Nothing fancy, Sichuan Garden really is all about the food."}
{"text":"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The \"mouth watering chicken\" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory \"ma la\" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy"}
{"text":"I recently spent 4 years living in Chongqing and Sichuan Garden has the most authentic Sichuan food I have eaten since leaving.  I ended up buying extra food to take home and went back for lunch the next day as well!  Each dish I had was amazing and most importantly the spicy dishes were actually spicy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is...quite bad. The service is terrible, they only accept MasterCard and cash, the chicken is full of gristle, and the restaurant smells like mildew and rotting shellfish. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fast service. Huge portions for a generous price. The taste was also very authentic. I wouldn't go anywhere else for Sichuan food in Chinatown except for this one."}
{"text":"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here."}
{"text":"Very cheap lunch specials of 6.99, variety of stews with rice and noodles are amazing. You can always taste the fresh vegtebales which is amazing.

This is not a luxury or beautiful place the food is good quality and cheap.

Don't forget the forun cookie also cash for lunch special."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up eating spicy food and now has a probably incurable spice addiction, this place always hits the spot, especially with their Dan Dan Noodles. 

My parents first brought me here as a wee child and that is one of the single greatest things they have done for me. 

The prices are very fair for the large portions and tastiness! And remember, this is coming from a broke-ass student with half dead tastebuds (probably dead from that glorious burning spice)."}
{"text":"holy moly. we drove all the way from nyc and mom wanted some sichuan food so we happened upon this place and boy were we in for a treat.

We ordered 2 noodle dishes, both were delicious and the perfect texture.

The lamb dish we ordered was a bit salty. 
Sweet and sour pork was tasty.
but the fish. this flash fried spicy fish was the highlight of my entire toronto trip. the delicate fish filets were crispy on the outside while soft and flaky on the inside with a kick of spice. 

highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wowowow my boyfriend and I have been looking for a Sichuan restaurant in Toronto for months and today we finally found one we love!!! This place is amazing! We got takeout and ordered the eggplant, Ma Po tofu, pork with garlic shoots, steamed dumplings and the whole fish in hot oil. The fish is the best fish I've EVER had. Perfect sauce, no fishy taste at all, so fresh!! We also got 12 steamed dumplings for 5.99, you can't go wrong with that. Ma po tofu actually had the Ma taste to it!! Eggplant was cooked very well too!!! We're so excited we finally found an amazing Sichuan restaurant in Toronto!!!!"}
{"text":"Sichuan Garden is definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Chinatown. I've gone there a few times for the lunch menu and it's always been a really nice experience.  The meal is inexpensive and the portions are decent. Soup and rice are included in the lunch special. I've tried the kungbao chicken, mapo tofu, and spicy eggplant dishes. They were all soooooo good. Be warned though: the food can be quite greasy. Overall, it's a great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Sichuan Garden is a no-nonsense Chinese restaurant that serves decent Sichuan cuisine at an affordable price. Go for  good spicy food and quick service but don't expect a dining experience. 

FOOD
Sichuan Garden serves up your typical Sichuan fare -- food that packs mouth-numbing heat from the liberal use of Sichuan peppers and chilis. As a party of 5, we ordered snow pea shoots, beef back ribs, \"husband and wife lung slices\" (aka. beef brisket and tripe), and water cooked fish; served to jasmine rice.  Food was properly prepared and tasted authentic but was nothing special: snow pea shoots were tender and mildly seasoned, husband and wife lung slices were firm in texture and served chilled, oil covering the water cooked fish was clean and clear, and the beef back ribs were seasoned and not overly salty, but could have been cooked a little more tender as the meat tended to stick to the bones. Overall, the food is very decent for its price, but won't blow you away -- unless you're not used to spicy food then you may be in for a little surprise. 

SERVICE
Service was prompt and courteous. Wait staff was attentive when taking orders and readily refilled our tea when requested. No complaints.

ENVIRONMENT & ATMOSPHERE
Nothing about the dining area and decor suggests any effort was made to create a dining experience. As you walk in, you cross a small footbridge that spans over a neglected man-made pond, with water features long been shut off. Everything seems worn and dated. Tables are set with only function in mind. Tables are draped in white garbage bag plastic and tableware consists of durable white china. But this is not that kind of restaurant. You come for good affordable food, not to impress your girlfriend's parents. Interestingly, the chairs look very similar to the Iron Throne from the Game of Thrones."}
{"text":"Sichuan is an institution of chinatown-Spadina. Their lunch menu is reasonably priced ($7 or $7.50 after including tax and tip), and includes soup, a main dish, rice, and tea. Service is good. Decor and music are terrible.

Two things to note here:

1. The majority of the patrons are chinese, not dabizi like me. This is not as 'westernized' as a lot of mainland chinese food in chinatown

2. It's a great place for large groups. Even with a party of 10, you'll probably be seated immediately at a table with a lazy susan. 

3. It's easy to miss. Look up -- the red sign is huge. The storefront is tiny, even though there's lots of room inside."}
{"text":"This is a warning to everyone, this restaurant is absolutely filthy. The carpet, walls and even the menus are covered in dirt. This place should be closed by the health department. We came in sat down, and within 2 minutes got up and left as many other people did. It is absolutely filthy and by the other reviews of people getting poisoned from rotten food, I am not surprised. If you have low standards as many people do, then go eat here."}
{"text":"Hope I can give 0, everything is really shit, worst service have ever seen, surcharge and force to tip, cash only, cannot be any worse for this shitting place"}
{"text":"hubby is craving spicy again, and this is one of his fave.

the pork slice poured over crispy rice cake is good - add spice and tomato makes it better. hot and sour soup is also very good. we also got hunan beef which i'm not a huge fan of. 

food is o-k, environment is crappy. I remember coming to this place like 10 years ago, and it still looks the same, the horrible hole in the wall is still there, and the exposed bad wooden floor is still.. exposed. the thing is, this place is in chinatown, where money goes a long way- i dunno what's up with the high prices for food, and yet they dont even fix up the place. 

i will only come here when hubby drags me here."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel \"heritage-sick\" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally. 

They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian. 

Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the \"Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms\" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.

Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.

They accept card as well as cash.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Service is good.
The location is at Chinatown, so don't expect that their food is toooo sanitary.
As a Chinese restaurant, their service is good enough."}
{"text":"I love eating spicy food, especially sichuang style foods. I especially love kungpao chicken, and I can just say, not many places does it right. I've tried many other sichuang place uptown, downtown, midtown. This place by far has the best kungpao chicken IMO. It's sichuang dish is pretty authentic.

Lunch special is awesome for UT students to take a break from work/school. $5.5? i think for a dish, unlimited rice, and soup of the day (either spicy sour soup or egg drop soup). Just great to go with few friends and share few dishes. 

Dinner has no special menu but has other great selection such as spicy bean sauce fish, sichuang style noodle, maopao tofu. 

I don't know man, if you are a fan of sichuang dish, you have to try it out at least once. I know the location is not great. The place looks old with out-dated decorations from the 80s? or older. But the food is definitely up to par. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing for a few dishes. Meh for some others. Know your dishes before you order.

Gong Bao Chicken is AMAZING. Best Gong Bao Chicken I've had anywhere.
The fish in spicy oil is good too.

Some of their other dishes, not so much. Came here with some non-asian friends, the stuff they ordered was gah. So essentially, good restaurant IF you know what to order."}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance were all decent. I came here after hiking and not having much lunch so I was quite hungry. The portions here are big and the price is pretty cheap. It's not as busy so I was able to get in right away on New Years Day. It's a great alternative to the other buzzing places on Spadina."}
{"text":"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever. 

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it."}
{"text":"Lunch special portions get smaller every year :)
They fail their inspections once in a while. 
Still, in Chinatown it is hard to find a better sichuan-style place."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and for party of 4 it was good service. For those who like spicy, it's a yes for this place. Worth try"}
{"text":"The food was good and were brought out very quickly - we went for lunch break and had enough time to eat everything.  Don't expect too much from service though.  Would recommend if you were in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a special dinner, and we all really enjoyed it! We were super hungry and walked in when the place was quite empty, so our food came out within 10 minutes. The ma po tofu and eggplant skillet were our favourite dishes - very flavourful. The kung bao chicken with peanuts and wonton soup were also really good. We were underwhelmed with the seafood and vegetable plate though... The flavour just wasn't that great.

Our server was nice... She came by whenever we needed her and kept our teapot full. They didn't have any dessert options which seems strange to me? Really though, we ate our weight in the ma po tofu, so it was probably for the best that there was no dessert."}
{"text":"This place is like an old Chinatown eatery in those San Fran  or NYC movies. You push through two old and badly-needs-paint job doors and over this fake little bridge that crosses a \"pond\" without water running and off you go into a tired restaurant. 

Expect to see a sad table sitting over a thin, white plastic cover and sip on overly-diluted tea. And as I flipped though the sticky and old menu I keep on wondering gee is my food going to be cooked by a scrubby man with a ciggy in his mouth as he work my stir fry? 

Well with that pleasant thought I mind my dad ordered the Mapo tofu, I pointed to the water-boiled beef and pursed my lips over the Yu-Xiang eggplants. \"Please go easy on the salt\" I broke a smile to the equally-tired-looking waiter. 

Moments later the Mapo tofu and the beef emerged in astonishing speed! 

Mapo Tofu has definitely got the numbing peppercorn powders all over it and is quite delicious! I don't see much diced pork in the sauce but the spicy level and the peppercorn level is quite good.  Will order next time for sure. 

The water-boiled beef arrives in a LARGE pot and layered with generous portions of sliced beef bathed in red chilly oil and covered with an array of spices. Underneath the beef are the mixed veggie of cleverly and Shanghai Bok choy. I love the flavour and the portion of this one! 

The egg plants were seared beautifully before tossed and fried in the special sauce. It is definitely on the oily side but the plant picks up flavour easily and it's my fav dish out of all three. 

We were surprised when the waiter brought us dessert made of gobi berry and white fungus and date. And the bill came under $35 for two people that's stuffed!

All in all, good flavour, portion and services. So Come here for the spicy food, don't come for the ambience. 

Cheerio!"}
{"text":"The food is authentic according to a friend from China, I personally did not find it spicy enough. Okay-ish service and good for take out (call beforehand, and their english isnt good). Only major downside is that I got some mild diarrhoea from it the next day."}
{"text":"Authentic what  ...FOOD POISONING?  C'mon people, willing to serve ROTTING food, have some class and AVOID!!!  For my $17, instead of serving fresh what I paid for, they chinked out by substituting portions of expired or recycled food (ie. food garbage)!  Clue #1 - parts of the 'DanDan' noodles smelled and tasted 'off'  Clue #2 - Mapo Tofu was disintegrating & had same bacterial odor & unpleasant chalky slime layer   Clue #3 - parts of both dishes had had GRIT or SAND (as if scraped off the floor), nasty!    It was my first visit and I made the mistake of taking out.   Never seen worse food standards, even in cheaper Chinese restaurants.  Don't you wish you knew what else they're up to in that kitchen?"}
{"text":"I grew up eating spicy Sichuan cuisine and I totally enjoyed the Gong Bao chicken (not spicy, but flavourful), water-boiled beef (very tender), and snow pea shoots. Service was also very speedy and friendly, as my family and I were the first ones in the restaurant for Saturday lunch. -1 star for old decor and a slight musty smell, but I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"There's a real garden in Sichuan Garden as soon as you walk in, but then theres no water below the bridge, which makes me wonder if this restaurants has changed hands since it opened or if the owners just got lazy.

We ordered:
- dan dan noodle: a bowl of noodles (no broth) in spicy sauce (so good!)
- minced garlic sauce pork: this is a cold dish with fatty meat dipped in garlic sauce...it leaves your breath smelling like garlic for the rest of the day, but it's so delish!
- water cooked beef: beef and nappa cooked in numb spicy broth : good, but not the best i've had even in toronto
- numb spicy pigs blood and cow stomach with lots and lots of yellow bean sprouts: the flavour was great and the cow stomach was very fresh, but too much yellow bean sprouts

Very authentic Sichuan/Szechuan dishes and my mom is super excited about coming back!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend who recommended this place. I was not disappointed. We both love spicy food and although the food wasnt super spicy (probably because I have a high tolerance to spice) it was delicious nonetheless. We really enjoyed our meal of spicy chicken with chili, mapo tofu and shrimp fried rice. A word of caution though, some people, might find the food a tad salty but for me it was perfect. I love me some salt. The servers were really nice as well. It made the meal that much better. 

PS: place is way bigger than it looks on the outside. I was very surprised."}
{"text":"Good duck cooked in beer sauce.  Kung bao fish was also good.  Very busy place."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant's food! Of course that this restaurant located on Chinatown, don't expect that food's too sanitary and service's too good. But it's totally good enough for me. Gross Blood Mong is my best love."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 different dishes here with friend. Recommend any dish with \"chili and garlic source\", which gives you a little sweet but not too much spicy. Rice is not soft enough."}
{"text":"Made the decision to try out this place within the plethora of Chinese cuisine that is Spadina's Chinatown. Wanted to try something with a bit more complex and spicy flavours than typical spots in the area, so we decided on Szechuan (Sichuan).

A little hesitant when we walked in because of the lack of patrons. Took a browse through the menu before we committed. Lots of options right off the bat, so we grabbed a seat.

Service was very good, despite a slight language gap. Very prompt and attentive. They were more than willing to do slight modifications to make a dish without meat, etc.

Ordered the following (I've posted photos of everything too):
Dan Dan Noodles (without meat): Initally, a nondescript noodle dish that I immediately thought, \"pass the hot sauce and seasons\". Wrong. A little mix of the dish revealed a ton of spices and herbs at the bottom of the bowl. Super flavourful and tasty, not overly spicy but had a nice kick.

Mapo Tofu:
We requested it without meat, so probably not as good as it's intended preparation. That being said, probably the most depth of flavours I've ever had in mapo. 

Steamed fish with chilis:
Takes about 15 minutes to make. Really simple dish. Perfectly steamed fish seasoned with a soy sauce mixture and chopped up red/green chilis. Texture and taste was perfect. Sometimes simple is better.

Sauteed garlic pea shoots:
Really, how can you go wrong with this dish. Sauteed greens. Went well with fish and noodles (realised the noodles had a few pea shoots in there, so maybe next time I'd switch up the sauteed green to avoid repetition).

I think this will become my go-to place in Spadina Chinatown."}
{"text":"A Chinatown staple. 

When you're feeling the bright lights of Chinatown, and hunting lazy susans and plastic chopsticks, SG is here for you. 

When you're feeling your couch and are ready to drop $60 on a true Chinese Canadian feast, SG is here for you. 

My fave dishes include: veggie fried rice, spicy broccoli and their General Tsao's chicken."}
{"text":"Oil kingdom!
We had the eggplants and they were literally floating in oil.
I had Sezchuan food many times in China and would not recommend this place."}
