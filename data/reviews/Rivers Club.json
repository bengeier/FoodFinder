{"text":"We had our wedding reception here in September 2013. The Rivers Club was fabulous! It couldn't have been better. Amanda Rapach was wonderful to work with. She was truly dedicated to making our day great and she was very responsive throughout our planning process. Amanda is a true professional and really make the planning easy. The food was great and so was the cake. The Rivers Club is a great venue!"}
{"text":"I am a signature gold/one member of club corp.  I travel all over the United States and have been to most club corp locations.  This club by far had the worst service and management I have ever encountered.  They got almost everything wrong.   They had a 50% off Happy hour on well drinks but not martinis.  I ordered a gin straight up and was charged full price when I was assured it was on happy hour. I moved to a table hoping for better service.  It was worse.  The server didn't even know how to  open a bottle of wine.  The entree was brought at just a few minutes after the salad.  I felt very rushed and there was no other customers in the restaurant. They were trying to clear my salad when I was only half done.  They calculated the bill wrong as well.  It was a very bad experience,"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a large group. Food was excellent. Service also excellent. The entire experience was marred by elevators. I happen to be handicapped and have trouble navigating stairs. For some unknown reason, the elevators would not go to The parking levels. We asked, and were told that they were turned off to that level. We were one of two large groups that evening. That is what keeps me from giving a 5 star rating, as all other aspects were quite good. Drinks are VERY expensive. As are dinners. I had a craft beer, which was good. The elevator/parking experience was the one very poor aspect, of an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"This review is specific to the gym facilities only.   I come here pretty much daily for the gym. It's nice because it's well laid out with a ton of equipment and it's very rarely super busy. If I do have to wait for the squat rack or a bench it usually only take a few minutes, aka enough time to stretch. The facilities are always clean and the locker rooms are so well maintained (especially the showers, which is amazing). The front desk staff is always lovely as well.  My few issues are that there aren't rubber plates, or enough plates, in the back lifting area, the equipment is a bit outdated, AND that the hours are limited in weekends (only stays open until 3/3:30 on Sat/Sunday).  Membership is not cheap (especially for Pittsburgh standards) but it's way better than Gold's gym around the corner if you are gym junkie."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for the Rivers Club for quite some time. It is a wonderful wedding venue, as my husband and I held our wedding reception here. An important thing to note, you don't need to be a member! The events coordinator is extremely helpful and very friendly, while the venue itself is incredibly accommodating. Our coordinator made the stresses of planning a reception so easy and enjoyable. Typically, food at weddings can be hit or miss since they prepare all the entrees at once. But the food at our reception was absolutely perfect: the filets were all a perfect medium rare! Our guests, to this day, tell us about how delicious the food was. Not only did we have our wedding reception here, we also had the rehearsal dinner at the Rivers Club. They reserved a board room in the back for our large party and it was perfectly intimate. We could socialize amongst ourselves without any distractions from other parties. Again, everyone loved the food! On top of great food, every member of the wait staff is incredibly friendly and patient. Customer service is top-notch here.   When our one year anniversary came, we chose to dine here to celebrate. Again, nothing but praises for the chef(s) and wait staff. We reserved a table, thinking we'd just get a spot in the dining room with other club members, but they placed us in a board room with just the two of us; so romantic! On top of that, they took the time to print out \"Happy Anniversary\" cards and decorate the room with candles all throughout. AND! we received a complimentary chocolate cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate icing. All this special treatment and we weren't even members of the Club!  I highly recommend anyone getting married to hold their reception here. In addition, the dining room is open to the public. The Rivers Club, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated dining options in Pittsburgh. The Rivers Club really goes above and beyond to make you feel special."}
{"text":"Excellent meeting facilities.  Great staff.  Just a little difficult to find if you're a first timer."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on Friday night as were in town visiting. Our experience could not have been better. The staff was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Newly renovated in 2016, the Rivers Club is a great place for hosting events. The staff is very professional and the location is excellent.  On issue I've noticed is often difficult to find your event. The Rivers Club is on multiple floors, so giving your attendees good directions is essential.   The Rivers Club is located Downtown, yet I rarely have issues finding street parking, although many choose to park in their garage.   Although not a member myself, I have several friends who belong and they enjoy the convenient, central location."}
{"text":"When a friend asked me to go in with him on a travelzoo deal to the River's Club, I was excited to get to try a new place and get a great deal. The travelzoo certificate my friend purchased was for 4 people to receive an appetizer, entree and dessert each. The total was $109. We made reservations for a Friday night and made our way downtown. When I was finally able to find the Club (2 elevators and 7 floors later), I was suprised to see that the huge dinning room was almost empty. There was only one other table dining. When we sat down, the maitre d informed us that with the travelzoo certificate, we would have $129 to spend for the table. We wer quite confused and taken aback by the fact that the certificate clearly states 4 appetizer, 4 entrees and 4 desserts but instead we were told that we would have a $129 credit instead. We looked over the menu, did the math and realized that 4 apps, entrees and desserts would be well over $129. when we explaied our disappointment to the maitre d, he first stated that there was nothing he could do and later offered to buy us a round of drinks. We obliged and carried on with our meal. The waitress picked up on our dissappointed but did not apologize or try to help. Rather, she talked to us as little as possible making the entire evening very awkward.   As for the food, we ordered the zuchini and ricotta fritters and the caprese kabobs. The fritters were excellent and kabobs were very good as well. Both appetizers were large enough to share. My dining companion also ordered the beer cheese soup as an appetizer. He really enjoyed the flavors. For my entree, I ordered one of the specials- chicken pesto. I found it odd that my enree came with a salad but the rest of my dining companions did not get a salad. The entrees were fairly small. They covered about 50% of the plate. My chicken was seasoned well but was rather dry. My husband also felt his chicken dish was slighlty over cooked. For dessert, my husband and I split the chocolate cake. Again, nothing special. Overall, the table felt that the food was good but small portions. However, we were all disappointed that we puchased a specific deal that they did not honor."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fitness center just under went a renovation, they have all new work out equipment. The full service locker room is fantastic! The steam sauna, the shower facilities everything is perfect. The dining also recently renovated is a great spot for happy hour and a nice dinner date. The food is amazing, I've never had anything bad! The staff is amazing and really takes the time to help you navigate what is available. The wine tasting, beer tasting and numerous others activities really makes this a must if you're downtown on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are members of Clubcorp and wanted to check this out while we were traveling.  We had dinner.  Very nice maitre'd who showed us to our table and our waitress was very sweet.  My husband said his filet was out of this world.  I had the smoked shrimp dinner (the waitress said she'd never had anyone order it before).  The shrimp were totally bland but the goat cheese grits were delicious.  It took a really long time to get our check and our dining experience took almost two hours.  It has the potential to be a really great dinner spot but the ambiance is kind of like you just stumbled into an overlit hotel lounge.  With some improvements it could be really great."}
{"text":"I ate here with my girlfriend and 2 other friends a couple of Fridays ago.  We had reservations for a Friday night and whenever we arrived there was only one other table in the club.  Since the dining room is fairly cavernous, it was almost awkward.  As you would expect at a finer dining establishment the tables were covered in white tablecloths and there was silverware on the table for a number of courses.  We were sat near the windows which overlooked the Monogahela River and I imagine that the view would have been pretty great but since we were visiting at night in winter, there was not much to be seen.  Our table decided to start off by splitting zucchini and ricotta fritters and the caprese kabobs while I also ordered the beer & 3 cheese soup since I thought that it sounded good.  The fritters were not completely what I expected but were really good and lived up to their name of fritters.  Meanwhile the caprese kabobs left a little to be desired as they were just some tomatoes and cheese on a kabob with a little balsalmic drizzle.  Finally my cheese soup was an interesting mixture.  I could taste the beer but it also tasted strongly of American cheese, you know the singles kind that you buy presliced at the supermarket?  So while I enjoyed it initially, by the end it sort of tasted like I was drinking a grilled cheese soup which wasn't the most appealing thing.  For my entree I went with the grilled lemon-basil chicken and rosemary shrimp while my girlfriend went with one of their specialties, the honey and lime swordfish.  Whenever our entrees came is when the service went from awkward to just plain weird.  I should say that all of dinner up to that point our server was very standoffish and made us feel uncomfortable.  Well she did not clean off our appetizers and plates before the entrees came even though we were finished with everything well in advance.  Since we were only at a 4 top, our table was fairly full and dishes and the first dish that she served she ended up hovering over one of my dining companions until he made room for the entree.  While I have made room for entrees on the table before, I don't know that I have ever seen anyone pressured into it by a server.  In any case I ended up thinking that all of the portion sizes for dinner were fairly small with none of them covering more than half of the plate that they were served on.  My entree still was decent as the lemon flavoring on the chicken was good even if my chicken was dry and rosemary always pairs well with shrimp.  My girlfriend ended up describing her meal as a piece of frozen fish stuffed onto a plate with none of the promised honey & lime.  Since she is not normally one to say bad things about food, boy am I glad that I did not get that.   The bottom line for me is that I really hope that I never come back here in the future.  The service that was provided was awkward and left me feeling uncomfortable and the food was nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"Check out the new dining room and JAZZ every other Wednesday with the beautiful, soulful sounds of Jessica Lee , Mark Strickland and special guests."}
{"text":"I attended a board meeting for Point Park's Alumni Association at the Rivers Club. It was a very professional space and very accommodating. The food provided was excellent. We had a little breakfast bar and then a deli lunch. There was more than enough food to go around and for a board meeting, it couldn't have been better!   I'd like to go back for a dinner when there are open nights for non-members."}
{"text":"I got to the river club five day a week and I love it a lot. I wish more people would go."}
