{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Cool people! There's just nothing like a fun local hangout to watch the game!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because the food is great, but the service is slow and they tend to get orders wrong.  If you are in a rush, I strongly recommend calling ahead (and make sure you double check your order).  Anyway, since the sandwiches are so good...even if you get the wrong thing it usually still tastes great!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. It took forever for the server to acknowledge that we were at the table. We had to let someone at the bar know that we were sitting at the table. The server passed the table a few times before greeting us. When the server finally greeted us, she did not ask how we were doing, apologize for the wait, or even introduce herself. She just asked what we wanted to drink. She then proceeded to take a long time to bring us our drinks and even then failed to bring us menus. We finally were able to get menus, sat there forever with the menus at the edge of the table so she would know that we were ready to order but once again she continued to pass our table. She finally came to take our orders and very rudely asked, \"What do you want?\" We asked her questions about the items that we wanted to order and she didn't know the menu at all. She failed to tell us what all came on the Philly and did know how many chicken fingers I would be getting with my meal. It did not take us long to get our food but she did not check up on us once the whole time we were eating. Oh, and she forgot to bring the condiments that we asked for. She also forgot to bring us napkins. When we were done with our food, we put our baskets at the end of the table, hoping she would see that we were done but again, she continued to pass our table. We had to ask another server for our ticket so that we could pay. Finally, after our drinks had been empty for a while, she brought us our ticket, AFTER we already payed through the other server. She took our drinks to refill them and took forever to bring them back. The restaurant wasn't even close to being busy with most people sitting at the bar, drinking. The food was great but the service sucked."}
{"text":"GOOD LORD!!! What is that smell? Oh..old deep fryer grease. Eeeeewwwwww. Gross. Unbearable sickly smell in this place. You guys seriously need to do something about the ventilation in the kitchen before a fry cook keels over, not to mention a customer. Yuck"}
{"text":"Not sure about the other two reviews, maybe they own the place, but this wasn't not a good visit.  We got there around 11:30 for lunch, not a person in the place( should have left then)!  We wait for our \"deer in the headlights waitress\" for a few minutes to seat us.  They obviously don't clean much as the place was filthy, and she seated us at a booth was dirty and didn't bother to wipe it down.  We ordered a wings, fries, cheese steak.  About two minutes later she comes back to tell us the frier isn't hot yet and it will be 30 minutes on the wings.  Change  that to a burger, but wait the fries too!  So I get some lays chips(best part of the meal).  Then I am told the ice tea has been made either.  This just went down hill, to sum it up cold burger and no taste on a cheesesteak.  Not sure how somewhere can screw that up, but this place manages to.  I would keep driving to another location if considering it.  I just pray I am not sick later!!!"}
{"text":"Who else is open until 2am around here!? I came here with a friend for the first time bc no one else was open after 11. Definitely a whole in the wall bar but it was fun and the people were nice! Cheap drinks, pool tables, patio, TouchTunes box to play whatever you want, not bad. The name of the place confuses you from the outside. It's definitely a BAR.  Haven't had the food but I think I'll be back for another night with cheap drinks and friends."}
{"text":"Wings are delicious. They're big, crispy and juicy. I think it's the jack Daniels sauce? It's really good."}
{"text":"Only one person working the bar/floor on a Saturday .The owner, Linda, is apparently OK with letting the place run into the ground. We informed the bartender/waiter of this and left without food, wait was too long. 

Shame on this owner."}
{"text":"Place is gross.. smells like a dirty fryer. And staff is horrendous. Only advice I can offer is that if you're on highway 74, don't stop and keep driving"}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed my experience at this pub/deli!  Friendly staff, tasty food, and is a comfortable venue. Had the club sandwich but didn't want any of the usual sides so they cut an orange up for me. I really appreciate  them thinking outside the box...made me feel special. 
Will be back..."}
{"text":"Wings - consistently the best I've had in CLT area since moving here almost 4 years ago. Could be a little cleaner an updated. Could use an identity. Food is always on point. This could seriously be a diamond in the rough if a few changes are made."}
{"text":"Best cheese steak in Indian Trail! Good beer, great service!! Food was awesome...so used to making concessions outside of Charlotte...don't have to here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST sandwiches anywhere around. All are GREAT. The atmosphere is just my speed, very relaxed and not fancy.  For me it's part of the charm of the place.  I do have to admit that the service is very hit/miss. I think this is mainly due to a lot of turnover in the wait staff.  They do seem to want to know if the service has been good/not good. More consistant service is the only thing keeping this place from being 5 Star"}
{"text":"Not only do I hate the way this place smells when you walk in....  I hate how the smell stays with you when you walk out....   it makes my clothes stink.... and my hair.  It's awful.  The food is ok... but not worth the way it makes you smell until you are able to change and take a shower."}
