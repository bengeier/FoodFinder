{"text":"I've been on a greek kick lately, so decided to give Greek in the Village a try.  
I ordered the Gyro Pita meal combo....this is where they lose the star...combo only meant pita with a pop, not a meal at all!  So I paid $2 for a can of pop, which I only realized once I got home.
But anyway, to the food!  My gyro pita was delicious!  The garlic sauce on it was delicious, the meat itself was flavourful, tender, and juicy - not at all dry, and the lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber were all very fresh.  
I will definitely return, but I'll ask for a side instead of a combo."}
{"text":"Ordered online. These guys don't read the dietary requests info on your order. Food was nothing special. Potatoes were horrible one had a big black patch, not burned seemed rotten."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Took two hours (one hour late) and the food wasn't even warm when it arrived. Hard to say what it would have been like hot and fresh.

Village salad - no dressing at all
Chicken souvlaki on pita - all had nasty wilted lettuce in them, ruined the taste even after the lettuce was pulled out
Tzatziki - pretty good, but very small
Stuffed grape leaves - pretty good
Calamari - tough, but we reheated
Hummus - tasteless with an odd texture"}
{"text":"WARNING: THIS PLACE GAVE ME FOOD POISONING.  I ate there and spent the next 12 hours vomiting because of bacteria in the food. Afterwards, I reported them to the Toronto Health Department - they investigated and found that the restaurant was NOT clean and they needed to give the staff training on food safety. 

DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"sad to see they closed for months ....but happy to see they only moved to bloor  and same great food!!!"}
{"text":"WORST TAKE AWAY EXPERIENCE EVER! We ordered from this place after our attempt at ordering at the Ottoman, also on Bloor, had fallen through (we were met by the rudest delivery driver who called me a fucking liar when I told him no one came to the door). After placing our order online, we were called back about a half hour later and were told that our order couldn't be met, but that they could give us stuffed grape leaves as a replacement. We accepted and then waited. Fast Forward to an hour an a half later, we still had not  received our food. My girlfriend then decided to call the restaurant to find out what was up. When she called she spoke with the rudest staff member imaginable. At first he told us to order our food, at which point she told them she would like to complain about an order. The man on the phone then yelled at her that she never ordered, and then that she had ordered twice before (real logical) and then screamed at her to \"Shut Up\" and hung up. Needless to say, we did not end up getting any food at all.  After doing a bit of searching, we had found out that this place and the Ottoman are actually the same place, run by the same staff. They share the same address and phone number."}
{"text":"I think when it left the Village it went to Bloor. I order often online from them. Portions are large, traditional greek fare. I normally get the 2x dinner special. If you like greek, I highly suggest it."}
{"text":"We got office party catering done by Greek in the village; 
Everybody loved everything from the greek salad,the dressing that was on the salad to die for.Souvlaki actually  big chuncks of excellent marinated real meat on the skewers not like some of the other greek places.
The food was delivered on time and the food was delivered really hot
Well definitly order again."}
{"text":"Terrible place !!!!
Bad customer service and guy was so rude .
He has to Learn the manners and ediquates."}
{"text":"Best kabob plate I've ever eaten in the GTA!! I got the lamb kabob plate with rice and potatoes. Everything is so fresh and they gave me extra sauce on the side like I requested. So good. 


Highly recommend. It's such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sunday special for a chicken Greek salad ... When I opened the take out container ... 4 pieces of very dry chicken and about one small handful of salad ... It was not a meal, it was a side other and no tzatziki as promised"}
{"text":"This place is closed. Pity b/c I loved it.  A new Indian joint has gone in.  Will check it out and review it shortly."}
{"text":"I can barely give this place one star. The rice was chalky, the chicken skewer had 4 small pieces the size of a grape on it, the potatoe had dark soft bits on it and the bread was not a pita, it was greasy naan. You could barely say there was tzaziki on it and there is definitelt zero tzaziki to dip your pita/naan in. We should have known when we walked into this place. Sometimes you walk into a place and keep ordering despite your better judgement and then when you leave with the food, you wish oh why I hadn't I chosen one of those other places I was thinking of? This was one of those places. 

For those who want to know, this is what you get for a chicken souvlaki plate: 4 pieces of small skewered chicken, approximately 4 pieces of cut up iceburg lettuce (like what you get in a bento box) with no dressing, white rice, 3 pieces of brown potatoe, a drizzle of tzaziki (approximately a teaspoon), one piece of folded greasy naan bread, and one olive. There's your chicken dinner!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly service. Typical Greek food but good. Finally we got a Greek take out place in the village. Delivery is fast."}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I made this yelp account to specifically warn people how terrible this restaurant is. No one should pay $50 for burnt chicken and powdered hummus. Please spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere. These owners should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Good food, well packaged for take out, not skimpy portions, accepts credit cards, fast service.

The only things I would like to have seen is them opening at 11 AM every day. Fridays, they open after the noon hour, which is very inconvenient.

Update: Downgraded by 1 star!

Details: Next day, I decided to phone ahead for lunch pickup and I looked up the restaurant info on Just-Eat. The lady at the counter when I went in before told me they were open at 11:30 during the week except Fridays, and the Just Eat site indicated the same thing. I phoned the restaurant, which directed me to another phone number (read very hastily on the voicemail) to place an order. I called that number - no answer. Showed up at the restaurant - it was closed. This was approx 12:15 PM.

Two of my pet peeves are businesses answering phones and keeping to advertised opening hours. I would advise anyone planning ahead to eat here, to confirm they will be open a day in advance of the day you plan to go - or you could be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's the typical Greek menu, but on a street where there are many restaurants to choose from for your dinning experience, Greek in the Village is a good choice for take out. 

There is a small seating area with a \"mish mash\" of tables and chairs and sorry to say not a very welcoming dining experience, yet the food makes up for the lack of atmosphere. 

The two partners are always friendly and will accommodate your request for possibly a small change i.e. I did not want potatoes and he gave me some more wonderful Greek salad.

The chicken souvlaki was just wonderful !!!  They use a grill instead of a flattop and it's not greasy at all, just the right amount of spices and large skewers.  

I've had take-out here two times and it has been great.  They cook everything to order so it takes a few more minutes, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Mortified.
I found many things to be wrong with this place, I ordered food for delivery and waited and hour and thirty five minutes. Upon arrival I caught the  driver speaking very poorly about me to tennants in the lobby. When i got up stairs my calamari was cold, the Styrofoam container looked like it was used before, my souvlakis where soggy, which made no sense as it had no sauces or dressing on it. and when i called to ask for a refund, i was yelled at,  disrespected more then  told to call the manager. upon callling he refused to refund me, unless i went to pry out the food i had thrown out in the trash. as it didnt look safe to consume, his reasoning was i needed to \"return his food\". I was very disappointed, I will never be eating or ordering food from this place for that matter. Just disgusting"}
{"text":"I had the chicken platter which consists of seasoned chicken with tzatziki sauce with rice, potatoes, and a handful of grilled vegetables.  Was pretty decent. The chicken was moist though it could have used more sauce. The rice and grilled vegetables were good; the vegetables were crisp and clearly not old. The potatoes were possibly the best with a great lemon flavoring drizzled on top. I'd say it's very simple food with simple/wholesome flavoring and not in a bad way. Very homey.

Average priced."}
{"text":"Ordered Ubereats today .. I included instructions to include utensils and provide extra black pepper it never made it into order .. the family meal comes with medium lentl soup but had no lentls .. the chicken souvlaki was very dry .. thankfully we also added some lamb sticks which were much better .. BE WARNED STAY AWAY FROM CHICKEN SOUVLAKI AND DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY UNLESS YOU HAVE YOUR UTENSILS"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered delivery from here they never showed up.  We waited an hour and a half and finally called back.  They claimed they buzzed us but no one answered - totally not true, b/c we had our phones on ring and they never rang.  Even if that was true, they had our phone numbers and never called.  Since they were now closed they refused to fill our order.  Fortunately we hadn't paid yet, but that was definitely enough to deter me from ordering there again for awhile.

The second time I ordered the food actually made it to my apartment.  Unfortunately, I learned that it wasn't worth it.  Not only was it expensive, but my gyro didn't even had tzatziki sauce on it!  The fries were so soggy and not even worth eating."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible terrible unbelievable how come they let them serve it's so bad it reminded me the refugee camps  there's a reason why there's a sink useless the guy never washes he's hands"}
{"text":"This was such a horrible delivery experience I hope nobody else makes the same mistake. 

Chicken skewers were tiny and burnt as was the pita. The \"greek salad\" was literally iceberg lettuce, one slice of tomato, one slice of cucumber, an olive and half a teaspoon of feta.

Its actually disrespectful that they serve amd charge for this quality of food."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! Always great quality!  We order from them several times a month and are never disappointed. The lamb is always amazing! Really love the dinners"}
{"text":"Best value for a full gyro dinner.  Everything was delivered fresh, delicious and in less than 30 minutes!  Unheard of downtown.  I'm a huge a gyro fan and they do it right.  Thanks guys!

Would appreciate a little more feta on the salad....that's really all."}
{"text":"Located on the northwest corner of Bloor and Manning Streets, the place is a long narrow restaurant that is really poorly laid out. Not only is the place really disorganized inside, the serving counter is a mess with lots of equipment on top of it and located just when you enter the door. The place smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. The server, didn't wash their hands or wear gloves which left me feeling unsure about what they served. I can't rate their food because I didn't eat anything given the lack of hygiene. Good luck to anyone who braves their food."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews before ordering... The sad thing is that the spices are actually really good, but the food is super dry, and what seems like cooked in the morning and served all throughout the day. Probably the most dry meat I've ever had. Most of it ended up in the garbage unfortunately because it was inedible :( 

The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I feel that if you were lucky enough to eat this as soon as it was cooked, it would probably be pretty good..."}
{"text":"I visit the Kinko's Fedex on Bloor a little too frequently for my liking (yay printing and overnighting), and the past two times I've passed Greek In The Village and had an instant gyro hard on. Insatiable cravings that lasts for days. 

Last night I was cozy in my lair and didn't feel like going out to a restaurant or a grocery store, and my husband wasn't feeling fetching me things. Fair, totally fair. I opened my handy Just-Eat app, and typed in Greek. Oooh! Brand new, white, blue and pretty Greek In The Village was on their delivery list. Wahoo! 

We had greek salads, gyros and extra pita with tzaziki. It really hit the spot, and I would order from them again in an Athens minute."}
