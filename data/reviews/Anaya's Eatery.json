{"text":"Wowow. Great place for breakfast. Looked up 'all day breakfast near me' and this was the closest one. I got bacon breakfast and fianc√© got the sausage breakfast.   Everything on the plate was nice and hot! Potatoes, 3 eggs the way you like it, bacon/sausage, and toast was steaming... it was NOT greasy, not salty.   Food was fresh and hearty, place was very clean and tidy, and price was very reasonable!  Bring change to tip them as they don't have the option on the card machine but they definitely deserve it. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"After coming here a few times, i'm sad to say I will not be back. Each time I would come in and request something the lady at the counter would tell me it was not possible and I would have to change my decision. First request was a kids meal (hot dog with fries) as stated on their menu. The lady told me I could not have that as the portion size is EXTREMELY small. Being a small individual, I like ordering off the kids menu as I cannot eat a full regular sized meal normally and I feel it is a waste of money and food. After that we requested the chicken quesadilla with a salad as the side. She continued to argue that salad is not allowed as a side and it had to be fries. Meanwhile, on their menu displayed over head, it lists salad as a side option. She constantly gave us a hard time with each request making it seem like we were only getting what she essentially wanted to give us.My co-workers and myself actually came across another diner similar (The Good Egg) on airport rd, and upon requesting a kids meal, they welcomed us with a smile. Needless to say, we will not be returning to Anaya's as our experience all 3 times was not entirely enjoyable. Their food is OK nothing spectacular. The gentlemen working in the back seemed extremely nice as he was the one who constantly had to give the girl at the front permission to serve us the items we requested."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this spot doesn't have more reviews! After walking in and up to the counter I was delighted that my boyfriend and I picked here to eat. The owner is so friendly, and even more importantly, so passionate about eggs! Haha   Everyone inside was happy and seemed happy to be there. The food was great, the only complaint I have is that the ketchup tasted a bit like tomato sauce...  but that's not enough for them to lose a star on my review. Eggs were perfectly cooked, toast was buttered but not too much :)  Free wifi was a plus!"}
{"text":"This app does not show that the place is closed due to renovations so I was very disappointed as a starving customer that's from NY. But the menu and pictures looked lovely."}
