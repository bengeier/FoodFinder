{"text":"I have only ever done takeout. with the size of there menu  there is nothing that i can say i will go here and no where else. The sauce for the Gyro is liquidity. For Middle eastern type food i would suggest going to Aladdin's"}
{"text":"As an Akron newbie, I drove past this place at least a dozen times on my way somewhere else for dinner thinking this little place in the strip mall couldn't be any good. Luckily, I saw the yelp reviews yesterday and stopped in for dinner tonight. Super food! I had really good stuffed grape leaves as an app (half beef, half veg) and a kibbe ball app, also very good. But the best part was the chicken shawarma. Comes wrapped up nice and neat in a crispy pita. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, crispy cucumbers....oh just try it. My total bill was less than $14 and I paid for both apps and the shawarma wrap. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"Not very good. Our server was nice, but I came for the food. Im a huge fan of mediteranian, so I have high hopes. The food was bland and our grape leaves with ground meat was empty. It looked like our \"meat stuffed leaves\" had very little meat and no flavor. Ive worked in Greek restaurants who have surpassed this meal by leaps and bounds. Our meal wasnt cheap either. While our appetizers were bland, my salad was over flavored. Too much feta, olives and banana peppers which takes the salt level over the top. No balance in flavor throughout the meal. I hate giving such a harsh review, but I have to be honest. Cooking is not only my career but my love for a great meal and experience as a guest stands true. I hope things will improve here. I probably wont return but I hope better for future guests."}
{"text":"When I come home to Akron, Continental Cuisine is always on my list of stops. It has by far the best hummus and grape leaves I've had and I can't get enough! It's a great, quiet, friendly place with good service and awesome food. The chicken shwarma, pizza, sweet potato fries, homemade yogurt - really all of it is delicious. I'd definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Unique in many ways. Family owned and operated. There are authentic ingredients and groceries to buy as you walk in. Self seating. Friendly and helpful servers really make you feel comfortable. I've had most of the items on the menu and they are always delicious! Very consistent. I recommend the falafel or spinach wrap for vegetarians. All the pizzas are great too.. And don't forget that they offer a delivery option! Perfect for you, your family, or your business luncheon"}
{"text":"I love this place! I am hooked on the fatoosh salad and lentil soup. Pita was served warm.  I haven't ordered anything else because I crave the soup and salad.  Service was great too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. The baba ganoush, hummus, and grape leaves (and house made yogurt) are fantastic. Great spot!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened - I now live in Cleveland but am in the area about once a month and it's a stop I make every time I'm there. I've never had a bad meal, from the mediterranean food to the pizza. Chicken shawarma pita and chicken fattoush salad are my faves, perfect every time and better than you can get anywhere else. And the sweet potato fries are delicious! Same great owners and staff are always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Don't know how the food is but a friend from Akron food page said she had a 14 dollar delivery and the driver just took her 20 and was going to leave without giving her any change.  When she mentioned it he said you want change back?  She said it was up to her what amount to tip and he replied that if she called there again she'd be asked to pick the food up herself.  This was posted on Chris's Akron food page on face book and has 60 comments so far and we all agree this isn't how you run a business.  Some of us have tried to get ahold of the manager for an explanation, so far no luck just answering machine.  That driver needs called on the carpet till he understands what customer service is.    FOLLOWUP.  The owner called and apologized and stated that was not their policy.  He will also speak with the driver.  He also said a dollar out two would have been fine.  A tip is expected but not required.  I would definitely give this place another chance ,he handled the situation professionally.  So I would raise their star rating."}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern food. Fresh salads. Great hummus and mixed grilled kabob plates. Delicious Gyro sandwiches and pizzas!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed, after seeing so many5 star reviews I expected more. The falafel appetizer was soggy, salad was ok. But the service was really just bearable. No, I do not plan to go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Have been coming here since they opened several years ago whenever I'm in Akron. The restaurant has really gone downhill, and, sadly, I won't be back. This evening, my party of 2 started with the hummus appetizer, which was very average. Hummus was served in a bowl, rather than the beautiful, traditional presentation on a plate with the lovely olive oily hollowed middle. Missed that yummy oil, and the tiny bit of paprika on top was as big as my pinky nail, in a tiny blob, not sprinkled appetizingly and generously on top. Flavor was lacking, and I so wanted to taste more lemon and garlic. I ordered the $5.99 falafel appetizer plate and was astonished to see only 2 small falafel balls, 2 slivers of pickle, and three tiny piles of chopped lettuce, tomatoes, and parsley, with a suspiciously tangy tahini sauce on the side. Talk about high profit margin! At least put three balls on the plate for the six bucks. These were obviously made hours ago and only minimally reheated, and lacked in spice/flavor. Dull eats for sure. My dinner companion enjoyed her lentil soup, but her greasy spanakopita, oddly accompanied by some pizza sauce for dipping, was enough to decide to visit Aladdin's from now on. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"I am in town for Thanksgiving and had lunch here on  Tuesday with my sister. We were a little apprehensive from the outside because it looked more like a deli to go than an actual restaurant, but we went in and are very glad we did! The service was top notch, as was the food. I ordered the falafel sandwich while my sister had the gyro. Both were very well made with the perfect combination of spices. As sides, we ordered french fries and rice, which were also perfect. I only wish I lived closer or visited Fairlawn more often!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorites. $2.00 beer for diners really hit the spot on a hot/humid day. We enjoyed our humus with hot sauce and scrumptious spinach/chicken/feta pizza. Our server Bradley was helpful and attentive. I love to support local quality businesses."}
{"text":"I stopped in here a while back, I was in town for work.  I ordered the wacky bread and a Prosciutto Pita, first let me say the bread alone was meal worthy, or at least order if sharing or you just want to take a lot of bread with you.  The Pita was perfectly yummy and flavorful.    I didn't order dessert as I couldn't have eaten it if I wanted to.  The place is great place to get Mediterranean food if in the area.    Service was very quick and the staff was friendly.    I would have no issues coming back here with friends or family if in town and wanting some good food."}
{"text":"This place is such a great hidden gem in Fairlawn.  I saw this place before but had second thoughts about it judging from the outside; however, I decided to come here after hearing good things from my barber.  This is a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover...the place was clean, the staff was friendly, and most importantly the food hit the spot.  You enter and see a tiny market where they sell various things so that you can make a mediterranean meal at home.  If you're eating there, then you seat yourself and the waitress greets you shortly.  Being newbies to the restaurant, the waitresses were both willing to make their suggestions on what's popular and their favorites.  This place is good for families, small groups, or even casual date night.  I order the falafel platter to start (pretty good falafel) , a small pizza (a white veggie...substituted artichokes for the olives), and a 4 piece fried chicken with JoJos (bountiful goodness that's crispy and juicy).  Overall everything hit the mark and was perfect to share between 2-3 people.  The only thing I would say is that the food could use a little more pepper or spice, but that's a personal preference.  Next I think we'll try more of the mediterranean parts of the menu to compare to local establishments."}
{"text":"Reading some of these reviews I get confused. Try Aladdins just down the road and you will throw rocks at this place. It's pretty blas√© food, positions are not that good, the grape leaves were tasteless and lacked feta like Aladdins, the gyro was also not tasty. The person who took my order called it a \"Jyro\" rather than a \"Year-o\". There's your first hint to run away as fast as you can."}
{"text":"Enjoyed visiting this place recently. Food selections are a lot and everything is cooked fresh and the food  preperations are excellent with the right portion size. Atmosphere is nice and everyone is very friendly. I enjoyed visiting this place. Special thanks to Rosie for taking good care of me and my friends. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Had terrible experience that i really think is hard to believe. Ordered take out and when picking up I found I had forgot coupon, customer rep harshly informed me that I couldn't use 2 coupons at once even if I had coupons,even though I had asked order taker if this was possible, cashier told me the girl on phone was new and didn't know, asked if I could read?  Then asked if I wanted food, take it or leave it. Interesting customer service approach, needless to say unsuccessful."}
{"text":"I really expected a lot of this place given all of the 5 star reviews. I was pretty let down. For all of the rave reviews I was also surprised that I was the only one their at noon on a Tuesday. The food I had was very forgettable.  I would only go back if I happened to befriend one of these yelpers who clearly love this place. I'm not sure where I would meet them since none of them were here when I visited."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are bad but this restaurant was very good and tasty! Came across it through yelp and being in the area. Ordered the super chicken gyro which was very filling and delicious. The waitress was very kind and helpful and the restaurant was clean. I would def go back and recommend this restaurant. Price is reasonable compared to other cities and the area, but not super cheap as other reviews make it seem. Def great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Still amazing! We got the gyros and fries, DELICIOUS!! Servers are super nice, food always fresh, taste is extraordinary! New menu is extensive and offers something for everyone. Chicken, gyros, pizza, fries, salads, hummus, cheesy pitas, lasagna...fantastic!!"}
{"text":"If ever there was a restaurant suffering from an identity crisis, this is it. Much like Babu's restaurant on \"Seinfeld\", the menu at the Continental Cuisine is a hodgepodge of items from the cuisines of various countries. Does this restaurant want to be an American restaurant? Italian? Lebanese? Seafood? The menu includes.....a shrimp basket, fried chicken, pizza, lasagna, hamburgers, gyros, hummus, grape leaves.....I was half expecting egg foo young to show up on the menu.  I had the hummus wrap, and while it was okay, Aladdin's certainly has nothing to worry about in the way of competition.  The one good thing I can say is that the young lady who was my waitress was quite friendly and attentive. Outside of that, I cannot possibly recommend this schizophrenic restaurant. Really.....the owners need to pick a cuisine and stick with it. By doing so, they could perfect what they make, instead of trying to satisfy everyone and being good at nothing."}
{"text":"Great pizzas and the delivery was quick. Loved the crust. I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I've lived in New York, Boston, LA, and had just about every version of a shawarma you can have. Unbelievably, nothing in the country comes close to the shawarmas at this little place in the middle of nowhere. After being introduced to shawarmas here, where they use incredibly high quality ingredients and it is expertly prepared, they make shawarma joints in major cities look like fast food to their fine dining.   The rest of the menu ranges from standard Mediterranean fair to American, and is well prepared, but if you've never had their shawarmas you are missing out on one of the best hidden gems in the country. If they brought that recipe to a major city and just focused on shawarmas, they'd be millionaires."}
{"text":"this place is great Mediterranean! Ive had a few different places, where things just don't taste good, but i have always been satisfied here. Their grape leaves are some of the best Ive had, there portions are generous, and they are well priced. Service has been hit or miss... usually friendly people, last time dining was a little awkward with a waitress who'd share way to much about her self, and wouldn't go away.. but usually good service. they also have take out and i believe still deliver. PLUS the food is usually on the healthier side of most choices you'd have to go."}
{"text":"Clean on the inside and very cute!  Been here three times & service was exceptional all three times.  The hummus was delicious and the grape leaves are vegan.  I tore up the Kafta and Chichen Schwarma (sp?).  The prices and portion are very nice!  Will return every time I have an appointment out that way!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I have ever had. Fattoush is delicious and hummus is creamy and perfect. We visit Akron yearly from Ny (where shawarma is abundant ) and can't get enough of it!!"}
{"text":"Visited a few Saturdays ago around 730 pm, as we were stay-cationing at a nearby hotel. Before we even got inside (we were looking at the beer & wine specials on their window signage), a man who worked there came out and told us \"takeout only\". No clue if it was a one-time situation or ongoing but we went somewhere else for dinner and it's unlikely that we will ever come back."}
{"text":"Jalape√±o cilantro hummus was phenomenal!! I also got a gyro which was pretty good.  Not as much meat on it as I was expecting for as large as it seemed. I would have like a few more pieces. Flavor was very good.  The cucumber sauce was really good, thinner than many, but still good!  When I took my hummus to go, they gave me a bag with some extra pita bread and a extra bag for my left over bread.  I will be back for sure for more hummus!"}
{"text":"Their Mediterranean/Lebanese food is most likely the best in the area.  The flavor is fantastic, and the authenticity is spot-on.  The wait staff is always very friendly as well.  I usually get the gyro (pronounced \"hero\") and it is the best I've ever had.  The yogurt in it was fantastic, the veggies in it were fresh, and the lamb was seasoned to perfection.  The prices are pretty cheap, one person can average about $10 total.  If you are looking for authentic Greek/Lebanese meal, this is the best Akron has to offer."}
{"text":"Our office ordered for lunch delivery.  My boss and I had the Gyro - We would not get it again.  The meat was not cut off the regular authentic gyro meat thing.  It was preformed frozen and reheated.  I can get the same meat at the Giant Eagle Deli.  Three other coworkers got the chicken shwarma.  It was ok.  we will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Come here if you want food that is delicious, smells great, looks appetizing and served with a smile.   The 'main' entrance looks like a small deli / grocery store but to the left is an entire formal dining room with a few booths and tables. Nicely decorated and you dont even know the deli next door exists.   Client of mine recommended me to come here and I was surprised that there wasn't a review yet!   Tried the Chicken Shwarma, Lentil Soup, Kebe, Homemade Rice pudding ... all were great.   Came on a Tuesday for lunch and it wasn't incredibly busy, free WiFi and friendly servers, I ended up sticking around and working for a couple of hours on my laptop. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service.  They served us rice which so over cooked it was gelatinous.  Our sever apologized and said she wished she could do something for us, but couldn't.    Spoke with owner, and he said that's how they make and we don't have to eat if we don't like it. But we still had to pay for it.   Grape leaves were good, but very small compared to what we normally get.   We will not return."}
{"text":"How does this place have 3.5 stars? Falafel, hummus and shawarma were incredible, and the service was genuine."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is always great and the food can't be beat. Their pizzas are delicious. And definitely get an order of hummus and puffy bread. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Clean, prompt service, and okay food.    The side salad served ahead of the main was extremely fresh and crispy romaine with diced tomatoes and more.    Ordered the Kafta Kabobs, which were char grilled as promised ... Maybe a little too char grilled, but very tasty nonetheless.    The sides for this entree were either not very well prepared or were a bit odd.  The grilled tomato was good, but the pieces of green pepper were simply raw.  The \"rice\" that accompanies the entree was a bit odd because of ordinary vegetable medley mixed in the rice."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years.  Always good food.  Generally the service is pretty good too.   I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"We order food from here often for work. The staff is very friendly and always deliver in a timely manner. Everything on the menu is delicious. My go to is the chicken shawarma wrap and spinach spanakopita- which comes in a fairly large quantity for one person. We will continue to order from here :)"}
