{"text":"The food isn't bad, but the service is terrible.  I was profiled by a server who accused me of walking out on a check.  It was both discriminatory profiling and defamation of character, both of which I could have sued the company for.  If being profiled is your thing, knock yourself out."}
{"text":"I am shocked at the previous negative  reviews.  I come to this restaurant often and I've always had a good meal, and some of the best service ever.  I would like to give special recognition to servers Kevin and Abby.  Both have spectacular personalities and are a joy to be around.  
Highlights of the restaurant are cleanliness,  CONSISTENCY (very important), and above all they offer healthy small portion meals. My boyfriend loves the shrimp meal and I like the chicken.  I miss the pork chop meal that was discontinued! .  Hopefully they'll bring it back. There is nothing generic from their salad dressing to even their barbecue sauce. There's after 8 o'clock specials of $4 appetizers, $2 slice pie and discount milkshakes.  You also get 10% off if you are a Lakeland or Lake Erie College student.
I love this restaurant and because it's healthy and cheap I could eat here every day.  I'm not sure why the (2) $$ because 2 people could easily eat for under $20!!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience at this Eat'n Park tonight; we won't be going back. We waited a few minutes to place our order and our drinks came out quickly, but the food never came. After an hour passed, my husband went to the front because we couldn't find our waitress and told them to cancel our order. A minute or so later the manger came by our table to tell us he took care of cancelling our order, REALLY??? What an awful manager; he didn't apologize for the inconvenience or try to explain what happened. Eat'n Park needs to train their employees better."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff! Best breakfast in Medina for sure."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant,  is a glorified truck stop. That pretty much sums up the service you get. The waitress's seem as though they could care less, at times.
Example; One waitress took our order. The food seemed to take longer than usual. Another waitress brought the food to the table. As she was serving my dish (Wich consisted of a bagel sandwich)she commented that the bagel had some sort of gross looking object on the bun and did I still want it. Of course not. My wife order fried potatoes as part of her breakfast. It looked as though they cut the potato and put it in the microwave.  To make a long ordeal short. The situation never got any better. Even with management intervention. The meals we're eventually comped.  There was no way I was going to pay for this mess. As repeat customers,  my wife and I had been coming in EVERY Friday morning. You no what irritated us the most? Not so much the food situation. Even cooks can have an off day, mistakes can be made. What bothered us the most was the attitude of all involved. No one really seemed to care. We never retured."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night after being away for 10 years or so. 

Good: friendly, efficient wait staff.

Bad: food kinda mediocre. A plate of strudel-like things at the salad bar had three or four nasty long black hairs strewn across the food. 

Will skip it for another ten years."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how slow this place is. We've given it a few chances and have never, ever had good service here."}
{"text":"Have been living in the area for 6 years and only went there because I was with a friend who wanted to go. I had the idea that they had low quality food, for some reason, but I thought, 'why not, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.' Unfortunately I wasn't. The food was either almost unseasoned (fish, fries) or too salty (garlic bread, pasta). Some of the side broccoli florets tasted off. Service was so-so (one of the guests at our table got the wrong order). Food is maybe a bit cheaper than other restaurants in the area but it's also very cheap quality. I prefer to patron locally owned restaurants that offer much better quality food. First and last time here for me."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone hates in this place. It's a good average Pittsburgh place to nosh.

AND they have lattes!"}
{"text":"Eat N Park stays open for 24 hours, and that is a good thing if you are out late at night and want to grab a bite to eat before going home.

In celebration of Smiley's Birthday (the company's Mascot), children can eat for $.99 (from select Kid's Menu items) for a limited time. 

Be sure that they give your child a \"Smiley Cookie\" and a children's pack (crayons, activity book, etc.) because the Servers tend to forget.

Also, during strawberry season, you can purchase a delicious strawberry pie for a limited time during the summer. Other Cream and Fruit pies are available, every day, in addition to the reasonably priced \"Pie Of The Month.\"

Eat N Park offers a variety of tasty breakfast, lunch, and dinner items and daily specials. And a Brunch (containing breakfast items) is offered on Sunday mornings.

The best thing that this chain offers, in my oppinion, is its homemade soups and farm-fresh salad bar--featuring fresh produce and fruits from local Ohio farms.

However, the staff need to do a better job making sure that the salad bar is stocked with food items, spoons, rolls, plates, and bowls.

Also, the staff need to do a better job keeping the tables clean and seating arriving customers in a timely fashion.

Futhermore, a certain Server need to be more hygienic and go in the bathroom to wipe her nose--then WASH HER HANDS!!!

Although she isn't a cook, she still has to handle and bring out her customer's beverages, plates of food/desserts.

If you join Smiley's email club, you can get a coupon for 10% off of a meal. Or check you weekly mail for coupons, to save money on your total bill.

Also, if you go see a movie at the nearby movie theater, you can bring your stub in to receive a discount off your bill in the evenings."}
{"text":"Meh.

I mean, who says that one person can't give their side to someone else at the table? Our waiter, apparently. Also, my father claimed his food was uncooked, not surprised. Mashed potato gravy had a weird, gelatin type texture."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I wasn't able to taste anything else for two days as the food, being as bland as it was, sucked all of the life from my taste buds and left my tongue a dead wiggly slab of uselss meat... much like the burger I ate. The service was equally as bad with our waitress more interested in hanging out with her teenage friends than checking to see if we had choked to death on the swill they served us. I suppose, since it's 24 hours, it has some redeeming qualities. For instance, if you become homeless, you could stay here all day and wouldn't have to sift through trash cans to find some familiar flavors."}
{"text":"Salad bar looked old. Dry food, mashed veggies, etc. The girl that usually does it had just come in.
Ashley was our waitress...FANTASTIC SERVICE!"}
{"text":"While on my vacation we stopped in and so glad we did!  Our waitress was very helpful and pleasant. Deborah was such a gem and you can tell she works hard and is an asset because was working that place. When we come back to town we want to come back and see her. Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the better Eat n' Parks in the area around Pittsburgh. Although, they do have problems sometimes with keeping things neat and clean around the salad bar and tables. However, the menu makes up for all that. It's signature breakfast menu and killer appetizers have kept me coming back to this establishment. They do refill the salad bar quite often and normally have a wide variety to choose from. The service and diversity of staff members really makes this place one of a kind."}
{"text":"I'm impressed above and beyond at the follow-up given to my issues by Eat 'n Park! I received a phone call and invitation to come back and give them another try. We did, last night and everything was on point! They have won us back because everything was fresh, delicious and prepared exactly as  we asked. The server was excellent, courteous and friendly as well. This has always been a favorite spot for informal family dinners and will continue to be.  I applaud Eat'n Park management for the professional way they handled my complaint and how courteous  they were to me. Keep up the great work!!! We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"If you have a choice, pick Dennys. Food was not seasoned and greasy. There wasn't much difference between this place and a regular fast food place except the rather unhappy and rude waiter."}
{"text":"Food here was pretty comparable to other eat n parks. My boyfriend and I came here late at night. He ordered soup, and props to the waitress for being honest and telling him not to get it, that it had been sitting all day and was soggy. We really appreciated the waitress being upfront about what to not order late at night. Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"New building is nice and kept clean
We eat there 2 or 3 times a month and have not been disappointed.  Food and service has been just fine.  For the price it is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for many years and recently after trying several of the new restaurants in Murrysville and being disappointed I had lunch here and mentioned to my wife that, unlike the news places, this restaurant is consistently good.

I was surprised that there were no reviews!

I'm pleased to recommend that, if you are in the area and want a great breakfast or lunch, don't hesitate to stop in here.  If you're in the mood for a simple dinner (like a burger or fish sandwich) this would be a good bet.

The service is great and the wait staff is friendly and attentive.

The restaurant is clean and has a great atmosphere.

Don't hesitate to stop in when in the area."}
{"text":"I was one of 5 total customers in the restaurant. I ordered a garden burger substitution for their super burger. The order took 50 minutes to come out and when it was finally served it was a single patty turkey burger.

This is not the first problem I've had at this location but it is my first review. I chose to stop going several months ago but then foolishly thought I'd give them another chance. This is just my experience and that experience has taught me to never step foot in this location again. Don't waste your time or money at this Eat N Park."}
{"text":"Came in today and waited at the podium for about 5 minutes before we were even greeted, and the restaurant was half empty. When we were finally seated the waitress met us fairly quickly but said she would come back for our drink orders. A few minutes later she returned and we ordered our drinks. Another 5 minutes passed before we finally got our drinks. We ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly, however my fries were cold and the vegetables were like they just came out of the can. No seasoning whatsoever on the corn or carrots and the carrots were not thoroughly cooked. The best part of the meal was the chai tea shake which was really good! But I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Tonight we ate dinner at my kids' favorite restaurant, Eat N'Park. This is our 4th time eating there since they reopened the new building. It was awesome. The food was really good, in fact my dinner was perfect. However, what made the whole experience awesome was our server, Sarah. She was so friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, towards the end of our meal, another table began making a fuss over something. They were very rude and the manager had to be called over. After that another server took over our table and we did not see Sarah again. I really hope that she is ok. I want her to know that she made our dinning experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  It took 10 min before anyone even approached me.  Another 5 minutes to get coffee.   40 minutes later I had to ask for the manager.  Never got my food,  or even received a refill on the  coffee.   The manager said the food was backed up.  I'm not sure how this is possible when other tables with multiple people came and left while I still waited.
On another note, the waitresses here look dirty.  I understand you have to wear your hair up, but for goodness sakes, put a brush through it.  This uncleansiness is not just from today,  but is all the time.  See for yourself. The service and food is not worth it.  Go to First Watch.  Great service at all times, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Typical all american diner food that surpasses their closest competition \"Denny's\".

Tonight was a busy Saturday during the dinner rush, food was typical but service was very slow and the salad bar wasn't restocked quick enough.. Many items, including dinner plates, were empty far too often.

Knocked off 2 stars tonight due to the lack of service and salad bar not being restocked to adequate levels."}
{"text":"Good food, but really spotty service. Out of three trips, one was excellent, one involved us waiting for forty minutes for our (cold) food, and one involved us waiting for fifteen minutes to even see a server before we just left money for a coffee. So it's not a bad place, but definitely stick to the drive thru."}
{"text":"The criterion that differentiates this Eat n Park location from all the others is its staff.  The servers at this location are efficient, hard-working, a great team and, most important, truly interested in the welfare of the customers.  We're on a first-name basis with the servers and engage in lively conversation on every visit.  We look forward to visiting our friends, the servers and management, at the Freeport Road Eat n Park."}
{"text":"A nice all around place to eat.  Prices are very good.  Their menu is huge and I can truly say I've never had a bad meal in there.  It is definitely the best place to go for REAL (with ice cream) milkshakes!  None of that soft serve stuff.  They offer a good salad and soup bar which you can fill up on as a meal.  I love the Rosemary Chicken from the menu and they just added an appetizer of a Shrimp and Spinach Bake that looks delicious.  I'll try that next time.  No WiFi"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the staff is completely defective on the late night shift. Every time I've come here after work (late), the waitresses disappear faster than Houdini, can't get an order right, or are just flat out rude or terrible. I work in Hospitality - either the owner should completely reassess this location or shut it down & let an actual decent restaurant take its place. Sad because the other locations are decent."}
{"text":"Jackie n if you live so close you can walk then get off your lazy butt and walk its called exercise try it. Dont blame them because you are lazy. 
The food is great reasonably priced and always fast and curtious"}
{"text":"I was told this location is the worst in the chain but didn't really believe there could be a difference in stores.  I have always been satisfied with Eat' Park for years.  However, tonight's experience was worthy of strong comment.  My traditional order ... Superburger, cole slaw, onion rings, and a chocolate shake.  Was looking forward to it all day.  Superburger was so stale and cold that the edges of the beef patties were curled and crusty.  Onion rings were so stale and cold that they literally could not be cut with a fork.  Of course, I was charged extra for the onion rings vs. fries on the combo.   Cole slaw and shake OK.  I elected to not make a fuss since I was with my granddaughter and she was having a good time.  At the end of the \"meal\" I watched the waitress yak with another server for 10 minutes while we waited for a check.  Will never return to this location and now have serious doubts about them all."}
{"text":"I've visited this place 3 times,  And I've enjoy everything, every time. Our food was hot and delicious, specially they're caramel latte..omg so good! !
The server was awesome.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had the rosemary chicken and  the chicken came back so hard,I had trouble cutting thru it. The bake potato was cold and the butter wouldn't melt.  Sent it back and wasn't that much better."}
{"text":"I'm a semi-regular customer at this Eat n Park and decided to stop in for a fish sandwich after a movie at the nearby Manor Theater. It was about 5:30 on a Saturday but there was no wait and the restaurant was not what I would call by any definition busy. I literally waited 10 minutes with no one coming over to help me, including the manager who walked by me two times. Even while trying to get someone's attention I was ignored. I can't believe they would let a paying customer leave even after muttering out \"This is ridiculous\" which I know was heard because the employees sitting at the diner watching TV (which is what the employees there mostly seem to do) looked at me and then looked back at the TV. I wrote a complaint E-mail when I got home, which I doubt I will hear back from since no one at this restaurant seems to be held accountable for anything. I know that Squirrel Hill (and especially this restaurant) is a lax area, but this was an all-time low in dining standards for me. I know if I personally gave this kind of service (especially as a manger) I would be fired without notice. Still hoping to hear back but not getting my hopes up."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Our waitress was distant seemed like her cat died or she killed someone. Than we ordered our food and instead of potato pancakes she brought hash browns, which were over salted and terrible. Then we got pie and we were on our second bite, and a very long hair was baked into the filling, barf. She suggested another piece of apple. Overall terrible experience, will never go back. Wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar area near the kitchen and you can see the cooks and almost everything is microwaved. Some employees didn't even wear gloves. Disgusting"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for their \"endless salad bar\", which at initially seemed a little sparse but actually had more than enough variety to crowd my salad plate...twice. I  appreciated the chickpeas and cottage cheese, nice protein sources for those who don't want to eat meat. I also liked the stuffed green olives and three bean salad which bring lively flavors to the salad. The fruit selection this time of year (apparently honeydew and cantelope, this week in December) was a little low. The soups were also good. That night was Italian wedding, which had a noticeably high meatball to pasta ratio. The welcomed banana bread hanging out around the soup bowls was just sweet enough for a dessert. 

I actually ordered $2 salad bar upgrade for my entree \"mile high meatloaf\". When meatloaf arrived, it looked pretty good but in came up short on taste. It kinda tasted like it came from a TV dinner, kinda artificial, not like a hamburger. The mashed potatoes and gravy didn't have that much taste either. The bread the meatloaf sat on was tough. Usually I like anything covered in gravy, but I probably wouldn't order the meatloaf again. Maybe I'll go for the Smothered Ground Sirlon instead next time. Overall, I'm not too disappointed because what I really wanted was the salad bar and it was good!"}
{"text":"You go to Eat'n Park for Pittsburgh's version of the classic diner experience.  You get simple American food, well prepared for a reasonable price.  You get friendly service and some smiley cookies for the kids. You can always get breakfast.

This Eat'n Park is a good representative for the chain.  I have rarely had a substandard experience here.  It is usually not too crowded, it is clean and the servers are professional.  On the one occasion I did have a problem here - I got lost when one server handed off to another, it happens - the manager took good care of it and gave me a free meal.

This location has recently remodeled and is recommended."}
{"text":"Very relaxed and a great place to stop by for some good food."}
{"text":"My family used to frequent this location weekly. However the restaurant has been without proper management for a while. The salad bar is dirty and never stocked. I never see a manager walking the floor. The kitchen is always slow even when the place is next to empty. 

Our current visit A BLT and 2 sausage bagel platters took 45 minutes to be served  And when it came it was wrong. I would recommend skipping a meal before i would recommend eating here. 

We asked for a manager and have been waiting 15 minutes for them to come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Request after sitting 10 minutes coffee and eggs well over. Coffee came in three minutes. Eggs total time 15 minutes COLD !
Patti has only three tables. Nowhere to be found. Ahhh here she is. 
Why can't eat n Park after all these years get it right? Is it the new generation of ownership just coasting; Mr. B?"}
{"text":"The Eat'n Park in my neighborhood -- which I visited over Thanksgiving break -- is large and bright, open 24-7, and boasts a soup and salad bar, an elaborate Sunday brunch, a midnight buffet and a colorful, laminated menu with more than 150 choices. 

I decided to pop into my local Eat'n Park over break with three friends from home, all of whom had also grown up on Smiley Cookies.  We were seated and greeted quickly by an extremely personable waitress.  After chatting for a few minutes, we ordered -- the food arrived less than 10 minutes later.  Before it did, however, we sampled the large salad bar (just $3 on top of a meal).  Although it did not live up to its usual standards (no spinach or romaine offered) it was still a delicious first course.

Our meals were also quite good.  Eat'n Park prides itself at purchasing all of its dairy and meat products locally -- this was quite evident.  One friend ordered a chicken sandwich while the other got a large cheeseburger; both, they said, were excellent.  I got two large whole grain blueberry pancakes.  And because Eat'n Park is the \"Place for Smiles,\" my flapjacks were topped with a powdered sugar grin.  The pancakes were thick with warm, blueberry-goodness -- hardly in need of the large bowl of maple syrup they arrived with.

After the meal, my friends and I stayed to chat for more than an hour.  This was no problem for our waitress, who continually returned to make chit-chat and refill our water.  By the time we left, we were not only sated by our food, but by the wonderful Pittsburgh establishment we just visited.

And, of course, we got a few Smiley Cookies for the road.  I can assure you they are as good today as they were when my grandmother bought them for me a decade and a half ago.  Nothing beats ending your meal with a Smile 

Rating: Don't Miss

Price: $ (6-8 dollars per lunch entree)"}
{"text":"Had a buy one get from coupon book. Only got two 75 off. That's OK I took it out on the bad waitress Tonya. She got no tip from me."}
{"text":"When we arrived on a Sunday AM, could not find a greeter or Hostess, waited several minutes and walked in only to have a waitress say ..Where is the greeter?   Buffet was out of several items until we mentioned it.  Service was quite good and the only thing redeemable.  The food that we ordered from the menu was acceptable, but not great.  Buffet was very unremarkable, bland,fried, overly salted.  Fresh fruit choice was good.  There are much better choices in the area, skip this place, unless you lured by moderate prices, for subpar food.  If corporate reads this, closer supervision is requisite at this location."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, really moderately priced American diner food. I enjoyed my All American Scrambler (scrambled eggs, Canadian bacon and cheese on a bagel) with a side of fruit.

Service is quick, staff were readily willing to accommodate our group of 6 at a large table and split our checks. We arrived on a Sunday morning at 10:30 and waited for just a minute to be seated.

You can't go wrong by choosing Eat N' Park for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Terrible, absolutely terrible. The tables were dirty, the food was average at best. The service was disappointing and the kitchen staff was unbelievably noisy. Yelling at each other, it was a horrible experience. Never again, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I ordered an omelette and the salad bar. The omelette was gross! They used the processed cheese food instead of cheese and I couldn't stomach it. It had a chemical taste. I think it was made properly just crappy ingredients. 

They did take back the omelette and did not charge me but then boosted the salad price because there was no other meal with it. In the end I paid way too much to eat salad. No protein is no good!!!

Service was ok and the people were nice, just don't order anything with cheese!"}
{"text":"As a chain, Eat'n Park used to be the standard to beat for a weekend breakfast.  No longer.  My usual location is the Ohio River Boulevard location in Avalon/Bellevue.  I visited their new building this past weekend, and I can tell you it will be my ONLY visit there.

I was seated promptly, and the new digs looked nice.  But, the service and food was HORRIBLE.  

The service:  My waitperson was a very cordial young woman.  She seemed competent.  Until she disappeared.  But, no worries, I was seated in a main \"service route\" from the kitchen and   watched service/management staff pass by at least 40 times.  Just not my service person.  But again, no worries.  My service person tells me she's just off to brew a new pot of decaf for me, and two minutes later someone comes by and offers to refill my cup.  Then my service person comes by with a new pot, and looks perplexed.  This happened three times.

Yes, three cups is a lot of coffee.  But, given the 10 minute wait for my server to take my order, and then 28 minutes for my plate of eggs and toast to show up, I had a lot of time to kill.

I had to call the manager over to complain about having served milk that was warm (room temp), and then complained about the slow delivery time.  A few minutes later, my young server comes back to say she thought service for my order was a little slow, and she was going to check on it.  So, it was just a few more minutes of waiting until I got my STONE COLD, old food.

This was not freshly made food.  This was my original order, that had been sitting all that time.  The over easy eggs were cold.  The french toast was cold, and was starting to harden a little bit.  The sausage was hot, but had been reheated, so was overly browned and inedible.  The little cup of fake maple syrup had a solid skin across it when it came to the table.  The food was basically inedible.  I left it on the table.  

Neither my waitperson or the manager got back to me to respond to my earlier complaints, so I decided to just figure I had spent $10 for three cups of decaf coffee.  That's the going rate at some premier coffee shops, I guess.  Yes, they should have responded better, and at least replaced the food.  But, I have already been in the restaurant for almost an hour, and had stuff to do.  How much longer could I wait.

I'll miss the old Eat'n Park, with its dated decor and seriously overworked staff.  But, I won't be missing anything, if the new option is this bad.  There are plenty of good breakfast locations in the immediate neighborhood, and another breakfast friendly chain a mile or two away.  I'll spend my money there from now on."}
{"text":"Just walked out of eat 'n park in Bellvue. Every time we have gone to the reopened store it goes down hill. 
 Tonight we waited 5 minutes before our waitress came to the table.  Gave her our order since we had been sitting so long and the menu rarely changes.  15 minutes after giving our order the waitress walks past and said to herself oh chicken salad and cheeseburger and kept walking.  30 minutes later  still no food.   Probably because  she didn't  put the order in.
  People who where sitting around us that came in after  received  their  food  one of which was a chicken salad.
  So we'll  have to find a new place to eat"}
{"text":"We ended up here accidentally. In town for a few days, we overshot our original exit and saw this place.

The food was fresh and good, the restaurant is quite the family place. Two of us got the salad bar; I tried the Rosemary Chicken. My sister ordered the small portion Baked Cod. We all liked the taste and the presentation.

The salad bar was not spectacular, but had a nice selection. My chicken and the fish were very flavorful. I tried the unsweetened Peach Ice Tea - great as is.

Overall, the place was nice and clean, the food was good and flavorful and everything is very family-friendly. I would recommend Eat'n Park Restaurant."}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh thing I just don't get. This place is not very good! It's a very below average diner with really crappy cookies."}
{"text":"Found an eatery closer to home and with a better price and better tasting foods. Eat' n Park isn't as good as it was 45-50 years ago. Foods at family owned restaurant and diners are by far better tasting. For a better price. Cooks aren't always good at what they are being hired to do. Sad to see a one time really good eatery go to waste. Coffee never tasted good for the past 15 or so years."}
{"text":"Eat N Park is a lot like Denny's. They're open 24 hours a day, they have standard diner type of food. And they're a pretty downscale sort of place. The big differences is Eat N Park is actually priced appropriately - the same dish is usually a buck or two cheaper. A good choice if you're hungry at 3am."}
{"text":"Working in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks...  crew and I have eaten here 3 times.  We were impressed.   Many people in the area were comparing Eat n Park to Dennys.   Dennys sucks compared to Eat n Park.  Salad bar was fresh and clean.  Victoria, our waitress was great.  BTW,  she is pretty hot too .  Only one complaint,  we ate pretty late one night and the floor was pretty messy.  Kinda gross when the waitress was stepping on dropped food and grinding in into the carpet right next to your table.  Plenty of employees seemed available...think floor should've been clean"}
{"text":"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. 

One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! 

Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. 

When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!

Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. 

I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It was better than I thought it was going to be, I haven't been to eat n park in probably a decade & I was happily surprised. Its a quesadilla with chicken, onions & cheese & came with lettuce, salsa & sour cream on the side. My only complaint is that the onions weren't cooked well. Overall I was happy w my meal & will be going back sometime."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner on Monday, June 19, 2017.  We were seated around 5:45 and a friendly waitress took our drink and food orders.  At 6 pm we got our drinks, at 6:15 our side dishes were served and the friendly waitress said 'your food will be right out'......and then the long wait. At 7:00, our meals arrived.  Everything was cold, eggs, bacon, chicken wrap, fries, coffee!, my the bagel in my bagel sandwich was barely toasted, the Canadian bacon was cold and there was a slice of American cheese that had to just come out of the fridge, as it was also cold.   The dining area was dirty.  The only plus at this EnP is that the staff is pleasant.  
This will be the last time we dine at EnP Homestead."}

Avoid at all costs. Fear that food handling is intentionally manhandled and patrons may be at health risk.

Have ten visit attempts due to visiting person in hospital. Never a good experience. Stay out!!!  Again, how can management not be aware of this place?!"}

{"text":"This Eat n Park location has really improved over the years.  I get a super burger and buffalo chicken wrap every time and it's really good.  Haven't had bad service yet either.

I definitely recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I grew up I Monroeville my who life and this eat n park was always a sure satisfaction visit. The past two times I have gone I have left very let down . From the cleanliness to the service and most importantly the food has gone down hill. My last experience was the final straw to keep me from going back. I ordered two kids mac N cheeses, hot turkey sandwich, and a buffalo chicken salad. One of the mac N cheeses came out in a dish that noone should ever serve food in. It  Was stained and looked brown tint compared to the other dish with Mac n cheese. The bread on the turkey sandwich was hard as if it was stale. Now I love the buffalo chicken salad there. This time not so much it look like it was thrown together with no pride and looked as if it was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. You're spose to get fries on the salad a trade mark thing of the eat n park salads yep they for got them. Didn't bring me the garlic toast that I ordered with my salad. I spoke to a manager about it he took it off the bill. The mac and cheese and the salad. He told me he would have a fresh one made and be brought out. I asked for it Togo cause my kids and girlfriend had already finished their food. He said would take 5 mins to have out. 10 mins later food finally comes out I pay we leave. I get home to eat the salad and what's missing the garlic toast. I'm so disappointed. Don't eat there. They really need to revamp their overall staff and standards."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Where else can you get a free refill on a latte, I mean really?  And with sugar-free syrups to boot.  Good service.  Good menu.  Good deal.  But be warned, Google maps doesn't get you there.  It gets you close, though.  It's behind Macy's, not around the corner from the Port Authority station.  Sheesh."}
{"text":"My daughter had an eye appointment before breakfast, so we both agreed to stop in for food before Saturday hit us in the gut while out and about. We will usually attempt EnP, Dormont first since it's close to home, and this morning, we had no problems getting a parking spot.
The longtime crew of ladies here are really great, from the hostess, to our servers. It's a toss up between Miss Lylet, and Bea on who we like better. Today, we had Miss Lylet :) 

My daughter ordered her very usual Original Breakfast smile with scrambled eggs, home fries, bacon, and wheat toast. Everything looked great on her plate, which is the important part, and she only drank one Caramel with Almond milk coffee something, when she usually takes one to go. 
     I got the Western omelet with mozzarella cheese, home fries, and sourdough toast. Great when Miss Lylet brought it out, except there was a hair buttered between the toast, eek! Miss Lylet apologized after seeing the hair, and took my plate back. I'm one that hates complaining, and freaking out over things, but even my iron insides knew better. A few minutes later, a fresh plate was brought out, and my toast was hairless! The food was cooked well, my home fries could've been cooked a little more to death. We usually have other locations in our mind, but I'm thinking Dormont's EnP is the one I'm liking more and more."}
{"text":"Since Eat N Park has gone through their major remodels, I've found myself stopping into the various locations around the area. Our go to has usually been the Dormont ENP, but if the parking lot is full, we know of a few alternate spots, and Banksville is usually the other option. My daughter, and I (sound familiar?!) have begun making Saturday morning brunch our time to catch up, and eat of course. We found a parking spot without any trouble, and didn't have to wait more than five minutes to be seated. The new building seems to have brightened things up, and the food was good. 
My daughter wasn't able to order her usual Caramel Mocha joka drink she likes, the machine was down according to the waitress. We both ordered the Super Griddle Smiles, hers with Banana Foster French Toast, and mine with the Smiley Waffle, yum! 
Our food was good, nothing came out greasy, plates were clean, and the food cooked well. The only no biggie issue was my daughter had to wait for her order of potato pancakes, and my order for potato pancakes somehow turned into home fries. I'm not one to freak out over a minor slip like this, but having worked in the industry, the ticket should've been checked, and the plates should've been checked before being served. Attention to detail, that's all.
Overall, I'm happy to see the remodels of the Eat N Parks, and don't mind stopping in for breakfast with family, and friends."}
{"text":"I called last night to see if I could get a whole lemon meringue pie. The lady told me they were out of whole lemon meringue pies but they could make me one and it would be ready in about 40 minutes. She even put me on hold to check the wait time... I then proceeded to wander around Target for 40 minutes before heading to Eat N Park. When I arrived, a man apologized and told me they still had to make the pie and it would be another 20 minutes. I agree to wait so he goes in the back to \"confirm\" the wait time and comes back and tells me it would be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour....  If you don't want to make the pie, just tell me when I call the first time instead of wasting my time! I ended up driving to the BJ's behind Eat N Park and found lemon meringue pies for $6.99. Next time I am skipping Eat N Park and going to BJ's."}
{"text":"The location and quality of food are the only reasons I would recommend this Eat n Park. Saturday morning breakfast dates have become a routine for my family, and we try to pick different establishments. We had a 15 minute wait for a table which isn't the end of the world, but the service has taken a nose dive, when I have to compare other EnP locations to this one. Our server seemed disorganized, and like she was having a hard time keeping up with her section.
Our food was good, it's really hard to mess up breakfast food, my sunny side eggs could've been cooked a little longer so I wasn't eating raw egg whites, but my waffle, and bacon were cooked well. I'm not one to complain about the small things, so I let it slide when I had to wait for a refill on iced tea, and having our missing salt shaker replaced. The server stopped by a total of twice, and took forever to stop at her other tables.
Once we had our check, no one was at either register. Why have two registers if no one is around? Customers are waiting in line to pay, and there's no system to the madness, so no one knows which register to wait in line at. 
This location is only good for a few reasons, customer service isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Went to eat n park for breakfast this morning! It was absolutely packed but they have so many different seating areas we were seated right away and had a delicious breakfast everything was cooked perfectly, a nice stop for a breakfast/ lunch"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that this Eat n Park has diminished so much in quality.  I actually used to work at this location, and I'm so disappointed.  The last few times I had been here was at night, so I was hoping that things would be better now. 

After the server of my section walked by me 3 times without acknowledging me, I decided to keep it simple and just get the salad bar. The only thing I asked from her was a coffee and a water with NO ICE. I said it loudly and stressed it. Coffee and water came, water filled with ice. 

The salad bar has about a third of its items empty, and I haven't seen anyone come and check it for the last 20 minutes I've been here. Nor has my server returned, though I saw her talking to other customers. 

The times I was here at night, the service was terrible, and the food room temperature.  That really miffed me, because it wasn't that busy when I was here, and there was no excuse for it. Oh well. I guess I'll have to travel a little farther for a bite from now on."}
{"text":"The new restaurant just opened recently. We were very disappointed. My breakfast included runny eggs (ordered over easy), cold toast, under cooked potatoes.... not very good."}
{"text":"There's not really a ton to say -- the food's generally okay, but it's cheap, open 24 hours, and the service has always been friendly.  You can get decently healthy sides with meals (they had two or three different choices of veggie things, in addition to rice and the standard greasy side fare); I've never tried the salad bar, but friends have, and it looks good.  (This location, at least, buys local produce, which, in my general experience, makes quite a difference in taste.)  Lastly, they have great milkshakes, and a nice selection of desserts."}
{"text":"This place is the worst , third and last time here. I managed to get the same lousy waitress two out of three times. The other waitress while not as bad was still far from good. I came here because I like eat n park in general and this was on the way to my girls school I was hoping that I just caught them at bad times but after three in a row I would have to say finding a good time is as hard as finding the waitress. So order and never see the waitress until she brings out my daughters food. No food for me yet because it's just too hard to make an omelette apparently."}
{"text":"A classic American fare at a prime location. This eat 'n park is accessible easily by bus and accepts DineExtra which is such a rarity. The servers are generally very nice and fun to talk to. The cheese stick appetizers are to die for so usually order 2 of those and a basket load of fries for a group of around 6 people. Then you need to order the Black Angus Superburger since it's a good bang for your buck. You might want to skip out on the \"sauce supreme\" though and the pickles. Also toasted garlic bread is complimentary so hit up your waiter/waitress with that!"}
{"text":"I've never had a good experience at this Eat 'n Park and I'm an EnP fan. The wait staff are focused on everything but their jobs. The food takes forever, and when it finally arrives, it's barely edible. 

Travel down the road a few miles to the Shaler EnP. You have a MUCH better experience."}
{"text":"Bad food, really bad service! I cannot recall a time when I actually felt unwelcome at a restaurant."}
{"text":"First time there and all i can say  
   Never again & the service was slow the bar wasn't that clean & by the time our food came it was cold there was lettuce in my daughter pancakes my wife hamburger patty was as thin as a nickel my chix pilliy taste like a live chicken so upset !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They may have updated the resturant but every time I go there is always hair in my food. So, I usually get one of their pies and skip eating there."}
{"text":"Drowning in homework I had one thing on my mind and it was waffles. I checked the time and sighed realising everything would be shut. We went out anyway and saw that eat'n park was open(thank heavens!). Food gods were being good to me. My friend and I ordered smiley face waffles and a Oreo milkshake. The waffles melted in my mouth like the butter melted on top of them. The thick milkshake made me feel like I was drinking an Oreo. If you love Oreos as much as I do I would highly recommend this one. Although it did get a little too sweet for me by the end of it. Hey, sharing is caring and what are friends for? My friend helped me finish what I couldn't. If you are a midnight binge eater then this is the place to go. Cheap, convenient and warm during those long cold nights filled with homework."}
{"text":"Great foods!!!! Extremely nice employees. Great way to chill out. They give kids free cookies every time you go. Amazing dessert's. Great pies."}
{"text":"Wow what's happened to Eat n Park ?  I drive past almost every day and There are barely 4 cars in the lot. I haven't been There for awhile but I really can't see how they can remain open."}
{"text":"Lamar is the best server in this restaurant. He's friendly and provides fast service. When we went to breakfast this morning, his section was full and they put us in Brittney's section. Service was very slow and she was very rude to us. Lamar graciously took our table. I asked to speak to the manager TWICE and he never materialized. If is wasn't for Lamar, we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great!! Very funny and good customer service! Food was ehh sub par. Great gluten free options.."}
{"text":"Brand new Eat n Park and it was so dirty inside.  Walked in for dinner and there were tables that were not bussed, dirty dishes and the carpet needed swept because there was stuff all over it under the tables.  Sat down at the table the hostess brought us to and it had to be wiped off because it was dirty.  Ordered super burgers, mine was fine, but the cheese was not melted, my husband's was cold.  Had to get a new one.  Heard the guy sitting in another booth beside us complain to the waitress that something was wrong with his meal as well.  Use to go to this Eat n Park many times when it was the older building.  This was our first trip to the new building and it was really a  shame it was dirty and the food was not that good.  Should have turned around and walked out, but we stayed.  Then to top it off, they lost our credit card!   We went back about 15 min later after discovering the card was missing, and they could not find it.  the manager said to call back in a half hour, we did and he never called us back.  Remembering back, the card was never returned from the waitress... Who knows who has it now?  We did report it lost, but this was a bad trip all around. It really is sad for such an iconic place, and a new building to boot and it was experience and dirty. There are a few others in the area that are below standard as well.  Just not the same anymore.  :("}
{"text":"Not a busy location but the hostess/waitress sat us right up against the restrooms even though there was plenty of seating in the main dining area. Smell much?  Seasonal fruit consists of only honeydew and cantaloupe. Didn't think it could get better until I received my over-cooked entrée. Instead of having the cooks make it over without burning it, they just took it away. I'm starving!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here there is always something that would withhold a positive experience. Today, our drink order was incorrect. No biggie. Easy fix. Then, we waited 10mins to place our order. It then took close to 40mins to get our food. My fiancés meal was completely the wrong chicken. We had both ordered the same chicken. Both servers were confused and acted like they had no clue what to do to fix the incorrect meal. So they sent it back to the kitchen to remake. Meanwhile, I ate my food, of which the mashed potatoes were only slightly warm, while my fiancé waited another 10mins for his meal to get fixed. We never received our rolls that accompanied our meals and figured why bother saying anything with how terrible everything else was. I was asked if I wanted a refill on my beverage and declined after the server once again stated the incorrect beverage I was drinking. We never received even an apology the whole time we were there and    The server continuously blamed the kitchen. All in all we were there about an hour and 20mins. For a meal that should have taken 35mins tops. In the past we have turned a cheek to any mishaps during our time at this restaurant, but from now on we will go out of our way to another eat n park if we decide to go there."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this location hoping it will be much better experience than last time. Another disappointment. Food was cold.  They forgot to put 2 salads, 2 sides and bread. Tried to call restaurant as soon as I got home- spend 20 min on the phone listening to busy signal. Finally talk to someone who informed me manager is not available -very hard to believe. Never going back. Hopefully Waterfront location is better"}
{"text":"Out of all of the Eat N' Parks in the south hills, this is the one that seems to always get it right. The food is a little better than your average family resturant or diner fare, the service is always good and the place is always sparkling clean. It's not the fanciest resturant, but it rates high on consistancy. It's always better than expected."}
{"text":"Not to bad I had breakfast there good price service good the floor is slippery don't like but good place"}
{"text":"They have gluten-free buns for all sandwiches and burgers for only 50 cents extra. How many other low cost restaurants offer this? I am a fan for this reason alone. My only gripe is that they eliminated the grilled salmon with dill sauce from their menu, which had been one of my favorites."}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing. Quality food with a good family environment. Would recommend to friends. Shout out to my amazing sever Kelsey."}
{"text":"Horrible food, I got sick last time iate there. Im sure my blood pressure went up . Greasy greasy,greasy. And theres an asian lady working there stocking the buffet & shes n poo t the cleanest please dont go there."}
{"text":"I would suggest avoiding this place at all costs. Me and my partner decided to bring a friend here for dinner, on our way home. We had been to this Eatn Park several times, and frequent the one in our town. This entire experience was completely horrid. We waited over fifteen minutes after being seated, finally after continuously looking around I was able to gain the attention of a staff member. She apologized, it seems our original waitress whom was supposed to take care of our table, did not want to. Although the original waitress named Sheryl was happy to wait on the tables around us. Towards the end of our meal, we overheard her making derogatory remarks to a busboy whom was African American. (Our friend whom we had taken to dinner, is also African American) after putting two and two together, this entire situation made sense. After she had made the comments, not two minutes later a manager was talking to the gentlemen bussing tables, I assume Sheryl had told the manager something. I was able to gain her attention and explained the situation of how we were ignored. She offered a 20% reduction of the bill. This establishment has left a horrible taste in my mouth. And I do not plan on returning to any Eatn Parks in the future. The waitress who actually waited on us, and whom continually apologized was quite nice and friendly, but sadly the damage was already done. I was unable to enjoy my meal whatsoever."}
{"text":"I have not been there in many years. I decided to go between lunch and dinner so i could relax and eat without a lot of people around.
They sat me right away when i got there. Told them i wanted iced tea and soup and salad bar. She told me to help myself. By the time i got my food my drink was at my table. Soup and salad is pretty simple and enjoyed having a slow and relaxing meal. The waitress came by a couple times to get me more iced tea. She was pleasant and enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Next to our hotel, and we found driving around Pittsburgh fairly confusing the first night so we ended up back here before hanger turned to meltdowns. It was okay. Like a bargain Denny's?? Kids liked their meals but they're pretty easy to please. I honestly would have enjoyed a quarter pounder combo from McD's more than my SuperBurger without special sauce (tartar sauce- shudder). Fries undercooked, bun in middle of two parties turned to bread-mush. Actual patties were tasty and cooked well. But really, sub-par fries at a diner chain?? Just not really acceptable. The salad bar looked fresh, it just didn't have a ton of items. It was an acceptable family stop."}
{"text":"Went today for the breakfast bar. Hoped that since it was a weekend they would actually keep it stocked but there were many empty food dishes and two people in our party didn't get to eat at all because their food choices were not filled. Asked to have one buffet removed and the manager was extremely rude. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the best location of the best restaurant in the world. I visit Eat'n Park every chance I get when I come from out of town. I regularly have cravings for this place even after moving out of state years ago."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet is great. There is bacon, eggs, waffles, fresh fruit, etc. Waitess was very friendly.
The strawberry pie is better than any I have tasted including NYC, San Francisco, or cruise ships. Have purchased whole and by the piece."}
{"text":"The waitress there are extremely rude .  On two occasions that I went there the same rudeness was there in 2 of the older wait staff.   Not sure what this is about..??  The first time a lady friend of mine did not order the Buffett and the watress tried to charge me..then proceeded to argue with me...lol..this morning.. another older last kept rolling her eyes at every quetion I had...lol...NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.."}
{"text":"I was here not too long ago and the food was below average. I mean, I was there at 1 AM so the food can sometimes be lacking at that time of night. I have been to better eat n' parks before. The fries were cold and the cheese on the fries was clumpy and almost a weird yellow color?"}
{"text":"My biggest concern is that my waitress one time stunk of cigarettes and had long, grey nails. Just uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Great service, Great server who did everything she can to get us what we needed, and a great price. The food was awesome and the salad bar was stocked with so much fresh fruit and vegetables."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.   Waited almost 10 minutes before we were greeted by a server.  Placed an order for 3 meals.  2 came out in an adequate amount of time.  3rd meal came out 20 minutes later after the other people at the table had finished their meals.  No explanation,  no apology, just walked away.  Her name was Samantha.  Didn't offer to take it off the bill.  Never said have a nice day.  Rude.  Paid at the checkout, explained my experience to the cashier.  She said, \"Sorry about that\". That's it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have two stars because they had the wrong food to me ,they gave me to much of my drink,some dud was very very very very very very mad about his food because of his toast or something like that and that is why I picked two stars."}
{"text":"Good people watching, salad bar always fresh, cool photos of old Rox, and they always accommodate my weird orders. Cheap, fast, local."}
{"text":"Why can't this place vacuum their floors? Stock their buffet? No plates, no lettuce, no spinach, no spring mix. No corn salad but they did have three beet eggs that my husband may or may not have cracked a tooth on they were so hard. No potato soup?!?!?! And they ran out of their mini muffins.... that's the reason I come to Eat n Park! Seriously save yourself the grief and head over to the one on 65.  Sadly we forgot why we stopped coming to this one but we will remember now!!!"}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of advertising for Eat 'n Park so finally tried it for breakfast. It was terrible. There was one other person in this Mentor location restaurant, so this should have been a red flag, but I was still optimistic in hoping the food would be good. Service was extremely slow and it wasn't like it was busy or anything. Finally my breakfast came. I asked for an egg over hard and repeated that it must be hard. It was served runny. The home fries were slices of very greasy, very salty potato warmed on a dirty grill because there were black dots all over the potato. I scraped off the grease and sludge but still only ate half due to all the salt. Then to add insult in injury I was billed for coffee that I never asked for nor never received. After consuming only half of my meal I went up to pay. I asked for the manager and nicely explained my dissatisfaction. She said she would ask the cook about the runny eggs, but there was no apology nor discount. As a comparison, every Bob Evans Restaurant I have been to has been wonderful. Bob Evans does substitutions, has endless refills on coffee and tea, and has friendly, helpful, and attentive staff. Never again will I go to Eat 'n Park in Mentor!"}
{"text":"After an adventurous day at Kennywood we ventured here as a result of one of the members of our party craving pancakes. Since I wasn't on the pancake train at that moment I ordered the baked cod marinaded in orange juice with a side of rice and bean medley. The cod was delicious as the orange juice marinade pleasantly complemented the taste of the cod. The rice was perfectly done and the bean medley was tasty and light thus making both accompaniments blend well with my cod. Craving something sweet I ordered the oreo sundae which was tasty but too sweet for my taste. The oreo bits with the whipped cream were really good but the brownie and fudge together made it too sweet. I think if they used less brownie and fudge with more vanilla ice cream it would have been better. If I go again I will make that request. Our server, I believe her name was Hollie, was very nice and accommodating. Sometimes you get servers who aren't as pleasant as we've unfortunately experienced so her demeanor was very much appreciated. In regards to the venue, I found it to be clean and well-updated not to mention being conveniently located off of rt 79. I'm not a regular Eat N Park customer but I would have no qualms about returning."}
{"text":"Horrible good. Very bad service. Why do I ever want to go here. I will never learn. Ordered a fish sandwich and it said tarter sauce. Got home from the drive thru they have. Guess what no tatter sauce! Crappy crappy."}
{"text":"I stopped going inside this particular Eat' Park years ago. Nasty clientele scarred me for life. But now that there is a Pick-Up window to save the day, it is a gawd send. Same menu food as inside without the disparaging experience."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean. Seated quickly. Great buffet and breakfast. Attentive waitress. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh in the 90s. It being home base for the purveyors of the Smiley Face  cookie, I'm very familiar with Eat'n Park. If you live in or around the 'burgh, or really anywhere in PA within 100 miles of PGH, you eat at Eat 'n Park. But especially if you live in the city or one of its near suburbs. It's pretty much the hometown branded Denny's, but as a chain, it's better than Denny's. You may not go often, or you may go once a week, or you may go every time you go out or work late -- but you go. It's part of living in southwestern PA.

So, in my time, I've eaten at a lot of Eat'n Parks. It's easy to do, because they're everywhere, kind of like how Starbucks is to coffee. Also, you can always count on an affordable and decent-if-unexciting meal when you order their signature endless soup-and-salad bar. It features a wide selection of greens, toppings and fixings, a rotating daily soup special, and always chili. It's nothing to write home about, but it'll get you through.

That's the general gist, and I'd give Eat'n Park a 3-star rating overall. But not all Eat'n Parks are created equal. And of the at least 20 that I've been to, three stand out as being duds. Sadly, this is one of them. Maybe because it's an over-the-border outlet and HQ isn't as concerned with consistency outside of PA, but this place doesn't measure up. Don't let this sub-par branch tarnish your overall impression -- if you're in PA and need to stop for a simple meal, you can do way worse than Eat'n Park. But if you're in or around Cuyahoga Falls, you won't miss anything by skipping this one."}
{"text":"Eat N' Park is the place you go when you find yourself out with friends late at night and you're looking for a place to hang. I've found myself here after many such events - proms, weddings, birthday parties, you name it. The food is not that great at all, but it's cheap, predictable, and since I've moved from Pittsburgh, it always feels a bit like home. It's definitely an integrated part of what Pittsburgh feels like to me. I've always had good service when I've gone here, and as others have said, it is the home of the Smiley cookie. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Lived around Monroeville all my life. Dined at eat n park a lot. The Monroeville restaurant has been going down hill for a while now. My last time dining there will be my last. The restaurant is not clean. The  men's room is absolutely horrible, dirty and stinky. The salad bar always has dirty plates soup bowls and spoons. To top it off the dinner I ordered had hair under the fish. Last straw. Corporate needs to step in and clean house. I would actually give it no stars. Eating there is a detriment to my health. Never again Even if the food was free."}
{"text":"People may complain that the food is not high quality or the place is a bit messy, but c'mon it is a diner!! I have been going to Eat N Park ever since I was a little kid living in Pittsburgh.  12 years ago I moved to NJ and now I go to school at Pitt and it is still one of my favorite restaurants.  Whenever my family comes to visit I do not want to go to some fancy high end restaurant, I always choose Eat n Park.  The nicest service, and greatest 'comfort food'.  They have one of the best salad bars, and I also love their fried zuchinni strips, and potato soap!!  Be sure to grab the cinnamon buns to go, as well as a smiley face cookie."}
{"text":"Surly, surly, surly drive-in window employees. Was put on hold for 6 minutes before ordering. Food was fine. After driving away I realized they had included no utensils, condiments, or even a napkin. Next time I'll just drive to the next Eat n Park. It's not as if there's any shortage of them."}
{"text":"This new location has a nice clean building and big parking lot. It is an improvement over the old location.

The food is the same. Never high quality but generally acceptable for a quick meal. For a family, it's very reasonably priced, often coming in half or 3/4 of some of the other area restaurants. 

However, the service both tableside and for take out is simply pitiful. While everyone is generally friendly and try to be helpful, they move glacially slow. There's no sense of urgency.

The best recent example is when I placed an order at 6:50, and they said it would be ready in a half hour. Knowing that they're slow, I showed up at 7:30. \"Just give us a few minutes,\" they told me as I arrived. Girl disappears, and doesn't return until 7:58. Of course the order is wrong -- missing multiple items -- which again I must wait for. 

Never again. It's their turn to wait for us to return. But don't worry, it will only be a few minutes."}
{"text":"Well since my last review -- we've eaten there on several occasions. 
No runs after the dinners thank goodness. And they seem to be keeping a better handle on the salad bar. 
You really can't complain for the price. 
I just had issues with getting sick after every single time we ate there. But I think they've fixed the problems. Good job!!!"}
{"text":"Darren it cracked me up to see you reviewed this Eat'n Park, but then I wasn't surprised a bit. I used to live blocks away from this place, and the location was ideal, for my favorite bar ever (Wilkie's Inn, now closed) was diagonally across the street from it. I actually have mostly bad memories of drunken friends fighting and/or confrontations here, but still this place beats all after a night at the bar. I can close my eyes and picture scrambled eggs and french toast, not to mention their delicious burgers with a side of pickles. And of course the obligatory Eat'n Park smiley face cookies, ah how I love them! Message to non-Pittsburghers, go to this (or any) Eat'n Park at least once! You'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish we had discovered this gem at the beginning of our vacation. It reminds me of an upscale Frisch's. The salad bar was amazing! I had that + the whale of a fish sandwich (seriously, 2 people could split this guy!). Husband had the pot roast & potatoes. Meat was good, potatoes not so much. Too dry. 1 son had the burger, said it was ok. Other son had chicken. It was ok.  He took a chai milkshake back to the hotel, I took a pb mousse dessert w/ me. Both were good. Service & price were both good. At checkout I grabbed a bear claw to go for the next morning's b'fast. Yum. Inexpensive, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Eat'n Park has been a part of my diet since I turned 16 years old and they were one of the only 24 hour joints in town. And if there was ever a Pittsburgh staple that needed some \"refreshment,\" this was it.

Fully remodeled locations, a fresh menu with plenty of their classics, low prices, and still 24 hours. All I have to say, is kudos to them as they did the transition fairly well.

Ultimately it's still just a 3 star establishment, but I don't say that in a bad way. You'll get a good, cheap meal, and typically good service. Plus, you can't go wrong with a milkshake, smiley cookie or grilled stickies."}
{"text":"I went to this location very late one evening (past midnight) with a friend to grab a bite to eat after work (24 hour location). When we walked in, there was no host to greet us and we eventually had to walk into the restaurant to find someone. They finally sat us and our waitress came by to take our order. From then on, it was excellent service. Food came out fast and hot and was better than I had expected. We ended up staying and talking for several hours and the waitress frequently stopped by to check on us and refill coffee. The restaurant including the bathroom seemed fairly clean and it was an overall excellent experience. The improvements that could be made are: better attention to the host stand, better employee appearance, and an updated interior look. The interior look felt dated and not as welcoming. Thankfully the food and our servers service made up for it. 

Service: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 3/5 
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"i did a take out  and   i wont do it again. i ordred  the tureky dinner it was a mess the turkey was dry they left out the potates and green beans were raw the roll that came with it were so hard the rest of my order was the same when i called the manger said he was sorry and would send a gift card t comp the order it neer came i think he just wanted to get me off the phone sham n you have mre proud in your buisness its not the frist time its happened i can forgive one time but three times"}
{"text":"I have been very pleased with the quality and freshness of the takeout food here. The team supporting the takeout orders are friendly. They've gotten my order correct on every occasion so far.  They have really good fish sandwiches and tasty fried zucchini! Yum! The window drive thru is convenient as well. They'll also give your pet treats at the drive thru. It definitely made me smile and my dog loved the treats too! :)))"}
{"text":"I really am digging this EatnPark's new makeover as of this year!   The parking lot has been expanded for more ample parking and inside the restaurant - the décor has been updated and expanded.  I noticed there are a lot more booths.. I am a booth girl myself. 
The take out window is wonderful and you no longer have to take your check up to the cashier.. the waitress handles for you.   My visit was around lunchtime and we were seated within a moments time and the service was good."}
{"text":"Very bad service every time we go here. Called this morning to find out if they did the breakfast buffet still. Woman on the phone seemed annoyed by the question and curtly said yes but only for a few more minutes. When we arrived the food in the buffet was lukewarm and picked over. The server who had tattoos all down her arm was very inattentive. We waited for 15 minutes to get our check. Just overall a bad experience. Not worth the $30 I had to pay. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is a PA staple. My fiancé tells me they are famous for their smiley face cookies--that's the first thing you see when you walk in. Service kind of sucks, had to ask for waiter to refill my water. For what it is, a quick serve, sit down type of place, you get what you expect. Food not great, but well priced and have lots and lots of menu items to choose from."}
{"text":"This was somehow the first Eat'n Park I've been to. I ordered a turkey club, and it was what I expected. We didn't have any complaints about the food, and since it wasn't busy we hung out for a while after we were done eating and were not rushed out. Our server was also super nice!"}
{"text":"Evidently has moody servers on in the a.m. Didn't enjoy my visit. We were sat away from everyone and it took forever to get our food even though we had kids! Will not return ever and their lucky I gave them any stars at all"}
{"text":"Nice selection, Good salad bar and great soups.  Portions are a little on the small side.  Pasta was over cooked, Salmon was ok,not great/ a little dry.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"I come eat here with my mom whenever I visit. Great food, good value! And the people here are friendly. The last time we came, though, we waited 10 minutes to be seated but we were the only ones waiting. There was simply no one at the hostess station. The girl at the bakery was pulling double duty. This isn't ideal because it was very difficult for my mom (84) to stand and wait. And seeing how there are so many seniors in the area, a designated hostess would be a good idea."}
{"text":"So there is a bigger eat n park not a mile down the road .... why do I choose the LITTLE eat n park next to get go ... the waitresses.

Phyllis & the other ladies welcome you as if you are guests in their home.

I love breakfast .... for some unknown reason they have the best oatmeal .... if you looking for a special treat ... blueberry pancakes with blueberry syrup.

Another reason I like this location ... fewer kids  (noise and behavior at the buffet)."}
{"text":"As someone who eats out very regularly,I want to like the eat n park chain as they are everywhere in Pittsburgh but I  dont understand why. Must be because its cheap when you have a family. If you frequent fast food or rarely go out you might be ok with spending money here, but the Pittsburgh area is full of great inexpensive options that taste good. The salad dressings on the bar are tasteless and the soups are  as well. Most of this is frozen food and it will satisfy kids with plain burger and fry, pancakes, eggs options, I imagine that's why it's popular or for people out late drinking when everything tasted good. Also its relatively inexpensive so people must like eat n park for that. The biscuit and gravy is bland too. Burgers are edible not great and the fish sandwich is the frozen plain Jane type with a huge bun. The fish itself not tasty"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is popular. The food is ok, it's edible. Most is freezer fare and bland. I imagine the price is the draw but there are plenty of mom and pop places in the same price range with better quality. I've had a wide variety of everything and if you're looking for a McDonald's sit down type restaurant you'll like it. If you're looking for homemade fare don't visit. The salad bar is ok but the salad dressings are not very good aside from the blue cheese. The breakfast buffet is edible not great not terrible. Dennys and IHOP are better choices if you're looking for cheaper chain food. You'd do better by visiting non chain places close by like Blinkys or Coachs."}
{"text":"The waitress was on her phone twice. The first time, I was trying to ask for napkins after my meal arrived. Once I got her attention after being on phone in the seating area, she said she would be right back. 10 minutes later, I was finished with my meal and saw her on her phone again behind the register next to the manager, still waiting for napkins. Lastly, after appx. 3 mins of staring them down turned around, the manager voiced to her that one of her tables seemed like I was waiting for something. She came over and had the nerve to joke \"we are so busy today\" as a reason to forget my simple request even though the area was half filled at most. The most frustrating part was that the manager seemed to find this behavior on the clock more than ok. I'm fine with dealing with a family crisis on phone behind the view of customers but this appeared to be sheer negligence that the manager was content with."}
{"text":"I feel like the thing about judging a restaurant is that you have to take it for what it is. Eat'n Park is not a trendy or \"New American\" restaurant or gastropub. If you are looking for a restaurant with an artful aesthetic, beautifully and creatively presented food, and fresh and locally sourced ingredients, you came to the wrong place. 

However, what you do get out of Eat'n Park is very friendly and efficient service, a large menu with a ton of options, very reasonable prices, awesome late-night hours while most other places are closed, and being able to use college dining dollars (for CMU students) to pay. All in all, EnP is a very solid choice when looking for inexpensive food after a long night."}
{"text":"Much of this review is based on nostalgia, because Eat N' Park was one of my favorite restaurants back when I was a kid. I live in Louisiana now, but every time I go up to visit, I always order two Superburgers (my favorite burger, anywhere) and an order of grilled stickies a la mode. I can't say much about their other food, but the Superburgers and grilled stickies are on-point."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh there are Eat 'n Park restaurants everywhere and this Squirrel Hill location stacks up on the food quality of other chain locations. I had the turkey club and fries for lunch and was very satisfied for a \"diner\" type level restaurant. My only complaint was the salad bar looked a bit messy which deterred me from ordering it. The various toppings were spilling into one another and it just did not look appealing. The waitress was good and the restaurant was clean. I liked that the front of the restaurant had garage style doors that were open to enjoy the nice weather. It is also a great place to go late night because it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Ive been here quite a few times in the last couple years. It seems like it gets worse everytime. 

The food was the only good thing about it on this visit. 

The kitchen staff was loud and an annoyance to say the least. I even believe a manager was acting out of order with them. 

Waitresses were rude to a gentleman and making upsetting remarks that were within earshot. They also were trash talking and having innapropriate conversations outside and inside of the kitchen that could be heard by most people in the place. They need to have a serious talk with the younger staff as to what appropriate behavior is.  

Wont be returning to this Eat N Park anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not the greatest place but more on the cheap less expensive side the waiter that waited on me tried to take advantage of me Thursday after Easter at my work asking for money not a good way to take advantage of your customers."}
{"text":"My family and i stopped at this restaurant on our way through town. The food was very good. i got a milkshake that was possibly the best ive ever had but the service was very very slow which was very confusing because there was a cook standing in the lobby flirting up a waitress while the manager and 2 or 3 other waitresses stood around in the lobby doing nothing but watch one upstanding waitress (apparently the only person who noticed she was at work) run like a mad woman to take care of everyone. Ive never seen a restaurant so poorly managed my entire life  and to top it off the entire restaurant got to hear a nice long screaming match between the staff"}
{"text":"What I love about ENP (aside from the Smiley Face cookies) is they have different things on the menu you don't find at Bob Evans and Cracker Barrel like vitamin water, Eggs Benedict, omelettes, buffet, healthier options.  Service was great."}
{"text":"The only reason why I ever eat at chain restaurants is if there is honest-to-God nothing else around or if it's a place that's not in my native Indiana.

It was kind of a mix of the two when I was in Medina. 

Medina has a ton of different chains and your typical mom and pop Mexican and Chinese joints. I figured if I was going to eat at a chain, it may as well have been somewhere I'd never been, so it was between here and Dickey's BBQ.

I was more in the mood for breakfast for dinner as opposed to barbecue, so that's why I came here. They have a little bakery up front that would remind you of Perkins. Frankly, the entire place just screams Perkins to me. Shoddy 90s decor? Check. Blue hairs who remember World War I? Check. Subpar food for a decent price? Check.

I had two pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs and they really were nothing to write home about. Literally the exact same thing you could get at Denny's, IHOP, or any other breakfast joint. Special isn't a word that comes to mind.

This place was busy on a Friday night, and I was surprised so many seniors were there at 7 PM. Meh, I guess I'm just too pretentious of a city girl these days to understand the appeal of places like this."}
{"text":"Morning: Only came once for a group event at the buffet, and it was nice. I had a cheerful server who promptly answered my request for \"a very strong coffee\" and brought me a huge espresso. 

Normal dining hours: Fine. Though it's been a while since I've come here for that. There's one server who used to work here who was an absolute delight. I hope that more people work here. I find Eat'n Park's food to be average and kind of overpriced for their quality, but the familiarity of the food is welcoming. 

Late night: Ugh. The service is horrible, and the food is more subpar. I use to come with friends who work at  a restaurant with me, so we are very forgiving, and we get really frustrated at the inattentiveness of the service here, seemingly by really apathetic annoyed teens. They're really not trying at all. Aside from the convenience of the location, going elsewhere would probably be a better bet. The food tastes kind of stale about half the time we come here at night, like dry chicken tenders, soggy fries, etc. The other half of the time it's acceptable, but again seems really overpriced to me for the quality and even the portion. 

This is the only Eat'n Park I've really tried, so I can't really speak for other locations, but I would definitely not come to this one late at night given the choice.

Late night - 1 star, normal hours - 3 stars. So averaged at 2?"}
{"text":"It's pretty standard food. I have friends who have worked there and so it's nice to be waited on by them. I enjoy the burgers for the most part. I find the waits to be a bit long though."}
{"text":"Honestly, never been here, but I want to give a shout out to this particular Eat N Park. My friend recently visited and here is his quote:

\"We had a fantastic hostess at enp who happened to have his pronouns on his name tag to allow for his identity while in transition! Glad enp is open and allowing its staff to be who they are!!!!\"

Thank you Banksville ENP for rolling with the times!"}
{"text":"Great place for the average diner food, but can be really packed on Saturday nights after the bars let out. I like it because it has vegetarian items, other than salads."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants that I've ever visited.  My eggs and home fries were ice-cold and the toast was stale and disgusting.  I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Eat'n Park has always been a neighborhood diner to me but it is so much more than that which I found out thanks to a prior Yelp event.  My husband and I went for dinner the other night as I was in the mood for fresh veggies and their well stocked all you can eat salad bar does  the trick.  They have rotating soups and I had a cup of chicken noodle as well as creamed broccoli (soup of the day) which was fantastic.  I piled every topping possible from bacon, olives, beats and cheese on top of my salad.  They have fruit as well as muffins and breads for sides.  The menu is pretty extensive and my husband went with a grilled flatbread pita type sandwich with chicken.  We saved room for dessert as it was $2 pies for the month. The Oreo cream pie with massive amounts of whipped cream was decadent and I ate every bite.  My husband was pleased with his banana cream pie.  The service was quick and we were in and out in less than hour."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was very slow and salad bar setup is annoying you bump into someone or the wall so very disappointed the super burger was good so still left a tip but shouldn't have"}
{"text":"Ordered the kale salad arrived absolutely no kale on the salad send it back my next salad was about one leaf of kale shredded  with a mound of Iceberg and a pinch of Mixed Field greens  at a price tag of  $10 suggest you do not order the kale salad even though the dressing and ingredients or a pallet success. Told the manager about the situation didn't care. very sad!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before a road trip at about 6 in the morning to fuel up our body and minds and we were pretty glad we did when it was said and done.

If you've been to one Eat N Park then you have a pretty good idea of what you're in for at another.  This location was clean, friendly and probably cause the time of day, not busy.  We ordered cheese sticks, the pot roast sandwich and a super burger (I know at 5A.M. But don't judge us lol).  All of the food came out hot and fresh and was really great in the flavor department.  

You would think my excitement would rate it 5 stars but hot fresh food and service with a smile should be the norm at any establishment but it doesn't negate the fact that it wasn't an awful experience either.  If you need some food and you're out that way, this is a solid stop."}
{"text":"I have had a really bad experience when I went to this outlet of Eat'n Park last month. I ordered pasta (idiotic idea of ordering Italian in an American fast food restaurant) and it was the most disgusting pasta I ever had. The pasta noodles tasted like cold rubber and the chicken was stale. As for the spinach leaves, those seemed as if they they were brought directly from the market and put on the plate without even cooking them. But the soup of the day (broccoli cheddar) was fine and edible. Thank you guys for giving me a chance to never ever come back to your outlet."}
{"text":"Well, it all stared when I first sat down. I didn't get waited on for about 20 minutes. It was only 11pm at night - not a prime time. When I got my silverware, I noticed it was used from the bathroom. The waitress gave me an attitude and I did not receive my food for another 30 minutes. I am very disappointed in my eat in at the park."}
{"text":"Nothing too fancy, for me it really is a burger place.  They have a gluten free menu and gluten free buns available.  It is a nice option in a pinch and this location usually has seats available.  Worst case, their carryout line is usually pretty short and speedy.  Usually I just get a burger and a baked potato.  I haven't had contamination issues with this Eat'n Park and I would go back again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place has the sorriest excuse for a Sunday brunch that I have ever seen. Given the location and excellent traffic flow, I assumed that this buffet  would offer a decent variety of breakfast and/or lunch options. I was wrong on both counts! No toast, no butter, no salad fixings to speak of.  We were \"lucky\" to have burnt pierogis, burnt potatoes, and burnt bacon. The only thing worse than the food was the service. Empty drinks, dirty dishes, terrible attitude. All of these things added up to one pathetic experience. 
I waited a day to leave this review to be sure that I wouldn't be too critical!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for a quick lunch with coworkers. It's a casual setting with great service and excellent American food. Drive thru for those days when you have to get back to the office but want to grab a bite to eat. Love it."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever gotten at a Eat N Park! Food was very fresh! Employees were very kind!"}
{"text":"I used to love Eat n'Park. There is a large variety of food and it is family-friendly. Recently, our visits have been tainted in some way. The last trip turned me off for a bit. I had tried the zucchini lasagna, which was really good. It had a nice balance of vegetables and cheese. The zucchini was crispy, not soggy at all. My daughter ordered the kid's French Toast, which seems pretty easy. The bread was made with stale bread and burnt in the middle. She also ordered an ice cream sundae. When we got her ice cream, there was blood on the plate and food. The waiter commented \"Geez. Did you want a different one?\" Needless to say, we did not want anymore food. When I cashed out, I had to ask the sundae be taken off since the waiter declined to do so."}
{"text":"Service is way too poor at this eat n Park understaffed - atleast could not cater to a Sunday crowd and you just have to wait for a long time for everything .
1) like a lot others have mentioned - takes a long time for someone to come and take your order
2) no silverware for the longest - even after we got our buffet - had to ask for it .
3) Coffee finally made it to our table when we were halfway through the meal 
4) ordered scrambled eggs and not sure what I got - just was tired of waiting so ate whatever was given to me ! 

Your best bet would be to get the buffet - that's going to be the quickest and maybe satisfying .

As for the food itself - everything was alright but service left me in no mood to review the place for food. Maybe next time ( if there is one !)"}
{"text":"No No Absolutely Not, NO

I've eaten at this location a few times through the years, and while the recent renovations are great, the rest of the experience was dreadful.  The staff didn't seem very attentive, and I constantly had to repeat myself to get condiments, water, even seating.  The food tasted dismal, and the portions were small. My milkshake was tiny for the price, and my smoothie looked like slushie that hadn't been prepared correctly. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Elevator Review: Food is meh. This place is powered by nostalgia. The staff is nice, but service is often unbearably slow. 

My son loves this restaurant. He loves the salad bar. He loves the Smiley Cookie. He loves the kids menu. This is why I think that EnP gets as many 4 and 5 star reviews as it gets: people ate there as children and nostalgia drives them to rate highly. 

The food is fine. EnP is a diner. You can go in and get good breakfast food (but there are better options). You can go in and get a good burger or sandwich (but again there are better options). And they have some great desserts (but, wait for it, there are better options). 

I have had numerous friends (all non-native Pittsburghers) act surprised when EnP's non-diner food is lackluster. (Is anyone really surprised that EnP doesn't make a great quesadilla?) If you're going, stick to the basics. 

My issue with the Murray Ave restaurant is the service. While there are servers that we absolutely love, it takes unreasonable amounts of time for food to arrive. My son and I waited 30+ minutes for a chicken sandwich and pancakes at a time when the restaurant was less than half-full. When we first started patronizing the Murray Ave location (2016) service was quick, but since mid-2017 the pace seems painfully slow. Did management change? Is the kitchen that understaffed?"}
{"text":"Eat 'n Park is Pittsburgh's version of IHOP.

Great food at cheap prices. Really good salads, sandwiches and burgers. Like Dave P. said, This is one of the better locations probably because it's right next to the headquarters.

Service has always been go at this location."}
{"text":"Decent Restaurant. Casual, food is like chicken tenders, fries, and burgers. Good hangout place for you and friends. Desserts are really good. 
Service- 6/10
Atmosphere- 7/10 good for kids, teenagers, family
Quality of food- 7/10
Desserts- 8/10
Cleanness- 7/10
Not bad place food is pretty good."}
{"text":"So we decided to give this location another try after the last mishap. 

Eat' n Park's corporate office sent us a generous gift card after we contacted them after our last experience. 

We arrived and were seated promptly. The restaurant wasn't crowed at all. Our waitress came and took our drink orders. A few minutes later she returned with our drinks and walked away. Ten minutes later she then goes outside for a smoke break. Are you F$@#&%* kidding me?! She could have taken our food order first but no, she had to smoke. 

She was out there for at least ten minutes before we decided to leave. So after 20 minutes after getting our drinks we still hadn't place our food order. We got up, went to the cash register, paid for our drinks and left! 

She was still outside smoking and talking to a co worker as we drove off. 

I will never step foot in this location again in life!"}
{"text":"I love this location!

The food is always consistently good! Lots of great choices on the menu like appetizers, bakery and breakfast items, burgers, salads, sandwiches, dinner entrees and desserts. The salad bar stays stocked and the waitstaff is always friendly. Service is usually on point too.

My wife and I both chose the Salad Bar Dinner Deal. With it you get your choose of select entrees and the full fruit, soup and salad bar for $10.99. 

After mulling over the menu we finally all decided on what we wanted. My wife chose the Baked Ziti. It features Ziti baked with sliced Italian sausage, marinara sauce, and mozzarella cheese and comes served with garlic toast. I chose the Spicy Pepper Pasta. It features grilled chicken breast, Italian sausage, onions and bell peppers, tossed with Portogallo Pepper blend over penne, tomato cream sauce and Asiago cheese and comes served with garlic toast also. I was so stuffed after multiple trips to the salad bar that I ended up taking my meal home for lunch the next day. The chicken and pasta were cooked and seasoned perfectly and full of flavor! It was so good and is now one of my favorite Eat' n Park meals. 

Our daughter chose a bacon cheese burger and added on the salad bar. Big surprise right? She loves the bacon cheese burger and gets it and the salad bar literally ever time we come. I wish we had saved room for dessert but we were too full. 

My only complaint is that the service could have been better. Once our food arrived our waitress was M.I.A. for a good 10 minutes as our daughter forgot to ask for ranch dressing for her fries and ate most of her burger while she waited. We had to ask for refills multiple times and for more napkins. It also took a while for our stack of dirty plates from the salad bar to be removed. I'm not sure what the hold up was as the restaurant was not very crowded."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a few years. I had a chicken quesadilla and it was terrible. If you MUST eat here, stick to the salad bar - something they can't mess up. Avoid at all costs though."}
{"text":"Eh, nothing particularly great or awful about this restaurant.  I went here with a friend last week, and ordered some breakfast food (which is tough to mess up).  I thought it would have been cheaper from what I had heard, so I would probably go to another place in the future for the quality of food I got for the price.  The wait staff was alright- part of our order was wrong but was fixed.  I can't actively endorse the Eat'n Park restaurants in the Burgh, but would stop in here again with a friend."}
{"text":"Not sure why I continue to let my wife talk me into eating here. The food was average at best. The hash browns were just a potato sponge for the grease and although they traded them for home fries, the home fries were greasy too. The restaurant was not busy but the service was sloooow. Ate all my eggs before waitress asked about the hash browns and had to wait for coffee refills a couple times. No smileys here. Should have went to the Donut Shack, they do much more than donuts and have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"My wife and have lost hope in one of our favorite chains. It seems every time we visit something goes wrong. My wife ordered the spinach tomato omelette which is supposed to come with mozzarella cheese and it came with American. My wife was disappointed and after waiting for her omelette she didn't want to wait again so she did the buffet. People seem to be nice enough but...."}
{"text":"I loves Denny's more...but. Eat n park doesn't really offer useful coupons or any coupons at all. It's clean . Oreo cream pie is awesome. Cute salad bar when it's not chaotic. Oh and I LOVE the banana foster !!!!!! The midnight and breakfast buffer r good too"}
{"text":"Good food, great staff.  Always friendly always clean very consistent.   The breakfast sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"I remember going to EnP when the dining room was half smoking, half non-smoking. It's all non-smoking now but the food has definitely lost it's allure.I went for lunch with my boyfriend and it was seriously underwhelming. I think traveling and eating food that is actually good has opened me up to reality. Eat-n-Park is just not good. It's OK but not good. You will get your meal for the day and maybe some coffee but between the people in the dining room coughing up a lung and the kids touching all over the salad bar it's just average.

If you are going to EnP for nostagic reason like I did, just stick to breakfast. You can only mess up breakfast so much. I had the Rachel (Turkey Reuben) and the coleslaw (which should have been saurkraut) was sweet and kind of ruined the sandwich. I do know that their loaded fries are delicious and breakfast is usually pretty good. Eat and Park isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Average food for the cheap."}
{"text":"This is the worst Eat 'N' Park I have ever been to.  Food not up to standard and the service is embarrassing!  I gave this location THREE chances.  Forget it and go to the one at South Park Entrance."}
{"text":"Great salad bar and friendly staff!  They always take good care of us and make sure we leave happy. It's a very affordable option to feed our whole family, and the kids love the smiley cookie they get at the end."}
{"text":"Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :)"}
{"text":"This was disappointing. 

Hot oatmeal was smeared to the bottom of a large bowl, which gave the impression they were trying to make it seem like a larger portion than it was. I'm guessing it was microwaved based on the texture.

Waitress was miserable.  

Coconut creme pie was delicious.

Would not go here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"We headed out to breakfast around 1pm after a late night at the drive in. We were delayed further by a dead battery and a tour of the neighbor's garden.  Finally arrived about 2pm.  We ordered the zucchini appetizer with ranch and horseradish.  Dip in ranch and touch the horseradish (real).  G ordered the giant fish sandwich, which was indeed giant!  He also had the salad bar and was satisfied with the variety.  I ordered the Italian breakfast sandwich.  I either missed the fact that it had pepper jack cheese or they didn't have it on the menu.  They graciously remade the sandwich with mozzarella, for which I was truly grateful!  Another waitress was helping in our section, serving food and refilling drinks.  We were well taken care of!  Cracker Barrel is next door and Bob Evans is across the street.  For us, Eat'n Park is different and just as good as the chains nearby.  I look forward to trying the pie or the Chai Tea milkshake next time.  They both looked great!"}
{"text":"I make sure to visit an Eat N Park every time I'm in Puttsburgh!  Love the cookies!   We had a positive breakfast experience.  Good food, good service very reasonable prices :)"}
{"text":"I had called to see if Pumpkin Creme pie was available, whole pie. They DO NOT have pies ready unless you pre-order. Drove to this location and no they were still in the oven, 45 min. THEIR problem is they DO NOT care. I should have ordered the pie. No offer to call me when done so I could come back, no sorry. This EatNPark is corporate owned per the clerk. Corporate should know they will soon be closed because of BAD customer service and employees who would rather collect unemployment."}
{"text":"(11/9/2014)  I think it was on Sunday night, but maybe technically Monday morning, when we were there.  I've never been to an Eat'n Park, but apparently everyone in the greater Pittsburgh area has.  Like a local version of a Denny's with it's smiley face logo and cheesy smiley face entree titles.  I think we planned it just right, go to Apple Inn, have lots of shots, close down bar, cross the street and go to Eat'n Park.  They must be used to it.  Lovely waitress was patient, but didn't take no sh*t from us.  The 3 AM shift has got to be either an entertaining or hell.

Food was, as I remember it, pretty good (take that opinion for what it's worth).  My Meat Lovers Omelet was sufficiently day-glo orange cheesy and had an appropriate amount of all the processed, sodium-laden meat bits (just the way I ordered it).  I was told I had to get the Breakfast Potatoes.  I think I ate one.  It was good.  My drunk tablemates horded the rest.

I insisted I had to have four smiley cookies, just because, everyone gets a cookie.  I don't know if they were free or if I paid for them.  It was a hard, dense cookie that tasted much like paste.  We ate them.  I think they were OK, they did make us smile."}
{"text":"Things started out okay..I just ordered coleslaw and sweet potato fries. The fries were good but could have been hotter. The coleslaw was literally cabbage in bland mayo. Sad as I used to love Eat'n Park coleslaw! My friend has a piece of the pumpkin cake and raved about it. 

I told the server that I was probably going to get something to go in a bit and she announced that her shift was over and ____ would check back with us. We waited and waited. No one even came back to that side of restaurant in over 15minutes. I decided to go up and pay the check and ask someone there to finish my order ( I just wanted a milkshake to go for my daughter) 

There was abundant confusion at the checkout as to who was checking out, who was hostessing and who was horseplaying with other employees. I did ask a server to get me a milkshake to go. Another employee checked out my friend. And I waited. and waited and I could see the server in the kitchen playing around and chatting with others. 5-7 minutes go by. While I waited. Another employee tried to give me a different bill for someone else's order. That was a good thing because I sent him back to find my milkshake. Finally another 3 minutes later my milkshake is delivered and I could leave. 

P.S. what is up with the new salad bar with the defective sneeze guard that is much to low!?"}
{"text":"I did hear back and was sent a gift cert. Nice gesture, but I find that I am in no hurry to use it."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast a week or two ago on a Friday morning. I'm not sure if it's because this specific location isn't frequented like others but the menu seemed to be different and smaller and they did not have a breakfast buffet. Now, as an eat n park lover I was severely upset that the buffet was not opened.. it was a popular time of morning and day (945 on a Friday) I also asked the waitress who was very uninviting why it wasn't opened. She said \"it's not open\" so not answering my question I was too nervous to pester. Not my favorite location."}
{"text":"Love this Eat'nPark & have been a fan for many years!  The Manager, Patrick is such an incredible Gentleman, I am not surprised at how well run it is.  
The service is great & the food really good!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for the brunch buffet. Hostess was a complete idiot and didn't know what was going on. When asked about the brunch, since it was 1pm, she didn't know and told us to go look to see if it was still up. Seriously? Isn't that your job? I did look, and I have never seen an EnP so sad since the Waterfront location."}
{"text":"Coming in here after midnight was like stepping into another world.. 

Food was decent, although our order was not entirely accurate.  Definitely nothing to write home about.  They do have garden burgers, but not much else for vegetarians.  

Our server had some sass, which was entertaining.  It was much busier than I would have expected at 0100 on a random Wednesday morning.  She was kept running around for entire visit, sassing folks, calling people \"honey\" and accidentally knocking drinks over.

Bathroom was fairly clean.. parking lot was dangerously icy.   

If driving through the area again, I would only stop here if everything else in town was closed."}
{"text":"Just left. Never even had a chance to order. Sat at the counter by myself to not take up a table. Wanted to grab a bite after a long day of working on Mothers Day. Whoever worked the counter at 4:30 PM on 5-14-17 stopped once to say she'd get to me in a minute.10 minutes later no service. Wasn't too busy inside (I've worked in the restaurant business in the past) and never came back. Unhappy, and I usually like Eat n Park...also, I'm usually a really good tipper. Her loss."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to eat'n park in a few years. We had a party of 7 so it took us just a little bit longer than usual to get seated. It still was a reasonable timeframe for 6pm of a Friday. We made the trip because they were giving away free Daniel Tiger books to each child. My daughter was more than pleased with that! 
When we ordered, I was surprised to see you could choose the soup and salad bar as your side with an entree. I ordered that with the whale of a cod fish sandwich for 10.99. The fish was not bad but not the best. The kids meal we ordered was grilled chicken breast with a fruit bowl. Very nice size portion. 
It would be nice to see eat'n park do more giveaways like this. If so, we will be back sooner."}
{"text":"This is my first and last time I will ever come here. The salad was okay and the garlic bread. I ordered chicken Alfredo. Well the pasta was cold and dry. The sauce looked nothing like Alfredo and the broccoli was brown. I just couldn't continue to eat it. Now I know why this is my first time here, but trust and believe I will not visit another one. I should have known by the pictures on the menu."}
{"text":"Eat' N Park is a family \"discount\" diner with a typical soup and salad bar which is sometimes converted into a Sunday brunch bar.  When I first came to an Eat' N Park, I thought that it was a clone of Frisch's.  Many of the menu items looked to be the same but this place was open 24 hours. Food is decent and prices are about average if not cheaper than other nearby eateries.

The fresh fruits and vegetables are hit or miss here.  I have tried the apple and strawberry pies which I thought were pretty good.   Service is also hit or miss but most of my visits have been positive."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter where you go in the area, Eat'n Park is always a guaranteed hit! With the signature smiley face cookie (which can be ordered online! In seasonal variations!) to the huge menu, it has something for everyone, at great prices."}
{"text":"I was there late Saturday afternoon and the salad bar was terrible...soup cold and many items empty!!!  I told the server and response was well we were hit hard this afternoon.  To me that doesn't constitute why I should have to eat that.  And no offer to get me hot soup!!  Also spoke with manager and he was not any better!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped Thursday evening for a couple of sandwiches after bowling. What usually takes about 45 minutes took 90 minutes. Our food was warm not hot, everything tasted ok. The real turn off was the extended wait time. Thank god they were not packed. Other patrons were upset about having to wait longer than necessary. There is a definite problem here with management. The waitresses seemed disgusted like they are over worked. They need a new manager and more staff. I sent a complaint to Eat N Park Corporate and got an e-mail from the manager. This was always a nice place to stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Not anymore!"}
{"text":"Eat n Park.  For someplace that originally started out as a drive in - wouldn't you think it would be Park - n Eat? I digress...

So Sunday morning - breakfast. I admit, our first choice was the Denny's down the street but it was gone!  What?? So, next best thing - Eat n Park!

We timed it perfectly.  Seated right away - NICE! Just before 11:00 am when they change from the breakfast bar to the brunch bar and the place gets bombarded from the church crowd. 

Me; French Toast Smile - Sausage
Wife: Pancake Smile - Sausage

Service - eh, the lady was nice but was obviously working a lot of tables.  Strange though, there were Eat n Park employees running around everywhere! If you've never watched them switch out the buffet, they are quite efficient at it.  One minute fruit and eggs, the next, fried chicken and pasta!

The sausage, so not good that we didn't finish eating it.  Who doesn't finish their sausage!!!!! 

The eggs - perfect. Over medium, hot, nice.

Pancakes and French Toast - not hot, no flavor. very bland. 

Syrup - yuk. odd flavor and thin. 

Me: French Toast Frown - mystery meat
Wife: Pancake Frown - mystery meat

Watching the switching of the buffet from breakfast to brunch plus hot eggs cooked to order = 2 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a long road trip for some comfort breakfast food and was disappointed- should've just grabbed subway and kept driving! 

The staff was pretty friendly, but a simple muffin took 30 minutes and the rest of the breakfast dragged on soon after. The hash browns looked like they were microwaved in an easy bake oven and the eggs ( asked for them scrambled), look like a cut up omelet.

The prices are your typical breakfast chain prices ( IHOP or Perkins), but the quality is very subpar. If you're attracted to the 24'hour service- just grab a cookie/coffee and bounce!"}
{"text":"I was at this Buffet the breakfast buffet last Tuesday the bacon was so crispy it was burnt you could not pick it up without it falling apart they use metal utensils that got hot and were untouchable the waffles or hard as a rock"}
{"text":"Good food and you do get a lot.  They have a nice salad bar you can get with your meal or by itself.  The salad bar is a little cramped and tends to get messy."}
{"text":"Eat'n Park is a staple here in the 'Burgh, and really, who doesn't like getting lunch at an Eat'n Park Restaurant? There's always something to enjoy here! Burgers, sandwiches, soups, a salad bar, pasta...and the milkshakes - yum! Some restaurants even offer separate rooms for meetings - what better way is there to go over info than over some delicious Eat'n Park chow?

That said, based on my recent experience I do not recommend this location if you're bringing a business group and using the separate room; the service for our group wasn't great. The staff did not check in on my group frequently at all, and we must have had 6 different waiters during the night, so we never knew who to flag down for assistance. It took quite a long time to get food, drinks, refills, and so forth - longer than it would have if we sat outside in the noisy main area.

This location redeems itself a little from its poor group service since it sells pie slices at its front desk in addition to entire pies; not all locations do this, and c'mon: sometimes there's just no room in my fridge for an entire pie! Sadly when I ordered my little slice of pie the woman who handed it to me shoved it into a bag and then gave me the bag handles first, without once considering whether she put my pie in upside down or not. Since I ordered a creme pie, and this caused a bit of a mess, it was an (admittedly first world problem) inconvenience that could have been easily solved with a little awareness.

But hey, otherwise, an Eat'n Park is an Eat'n Park - fairly fresh and simply yummy. I am a huge fan of their burgers - both meat AND veggie! - as well as their Alfredo dinner, salads, and soups. And milkshakes. And pies. See? It really is all good! (Now I just need to get my hands on some Pittsburgh Dad smiley cookies!)"}
{"text":"I guess you could say I'm a regular here. There are maybe four or five attentive servers here, the rest are lamentable. Food is food. Decent enough and never bad. 

The managers here are pathetic and probably the worst I've seen. They have no control over their staff or the restaurant.  What are you doing about this, Eat'n Park?"}
{"text":"Nice place. Entrees were good. Salad bar was nice and well stocked. We enjoyed the soup. Waitress was attentive. Child cookie was cute."}
{"text":"Food was plentiful and delicious. I ordered corned beef hash and over easy eggs... Spot on perfect. My wife got the Angus burger on gluten free bread and she LOVED it. Service was prompt and very friendly. Even offered us a coffee to go. I would come back if I lived here... But we were just passing through. Saw a lot of happy customers and kids devouring their pancakes!"}
{"text":"Sam and his staff are awesome.  Pleasant staff, great salad bar, farm fresh local produce and pride in their community, makes for a perfect meal.  Best restaurant in the chain!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Small and just odd. Dined here twice and the second time was my last. (see tip below) I'm not sure why some experiences are sooo much better than others when it comes to the various E&P locations but I will give you and example. I ordered the hot turkey sandwich...one of my faves. When it was brought out, the gravy has the consistency of water with basically no flavor at all and I ended up with a soggy bread sandwich. My waitress couldn't understand what I was talking about but anyone who knows anything about gravy knows it should at least coat your spoon, right? Anyway, corporate E&P apologized and sent a gift card so I could dine at my location of choice...the one near South Hills Village Mall...and that's the reason for the star."}
{"text":"I was in a jam and was meeting relatives for an impromptu breakfast. 
This was not fast and easy HOWEVER- they did a great job making a slow experience by giving us free cookies and very nice service. My egg whites spinach omelette was excellent."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat at!!  Terrible service and terrible food! I looked this place up online while sitting on the toilet from there disgusting food, all I saw was criticism! Will never eat at eat n park again because of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This chain that I have only seen in Pittsburgh seems a little like Denny's, but I like it better. It's a 24 hour restaurant with a pretty large menu. They also sell some pies from their front counter. 

I think it's a good spot for breakfast. They have pretty decent coffee, service is quick and friendly and he food is hearty. 

I got the Original Breakfast Smile, which comes with eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, toast and choice of potatoes. I got sausage, which was the weakest part.  The patties were kind of wet and a little greasy. I really liked their home fries, though, and the portion size was pretty large. The scrambled eggs were cooked just fine. 

There is a small counter area where I say and got quick service. The restaurant is mainly booths and tables. There was a television behind the counter with the news on, so I could catch up on local happenings. 

Prices are good. I would come back, maybe not for dinner but for breakfast  or lunch."}
{"text":"This is a review of one experience getting breakfast here about 5:00 am. They appear to be one of the few chains offering 24 hour service, and I needed breakfast at 5:00 so stopped here. 

Service is lacking at this hour. When I came in there was no hostess or server anywhere. Someone showed up in a minute or two, but it took several minutes for me to get my order placed and then 25 minutes to get a basic breakfast served. It also took about five minutes or so to get coffee. 

The breakfast was two eggs, sausage, potatoes and toast. At least it was hot. It was also pretty decent as far as breakfasts go. The price with coffee was about $10. 

The server was nice, but it didn't seem they were really set up to provide proper service
In the early morning."}
{"text":"As far at E'NP's go, this is one of my favorites.  

The service is always quick.  Always.  I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for food even when there's a line out the door.

This E'NP (which is listed as being in Bellevue, though it's actually in Avalon) was the hang out spot for the teens when I was in high school and still appears to be so judging by the number of kids that flood here after football games.  Think The Max, but with less magic tricks and far fewer dance-offs.  The wait staff will yell at kids if they get too crazy, and in some cases, kick them out.  Much appreciated.  The Avalon cops also hang out here at night, so it never gets too rowdy.

The food here is diner food.  Not much else to it.  Don't order the steak and you won't be disappointed.  There is a pretty big salad bar at this location, and the food changes based on the time of day.

One thing that I love about this particular location is the speed at which they attack take-out orders.  Again never a more than a 20 minute wait.  They also have fresh bakery items in the case, which I love since not all E'NP's bother with that.  Make sure you get a Smiley Cookie before you leave...Or a dozen."}
{"text":"Pure garbage.  Being a Pittsburgh resident all of my life, I have been dragged here many times by people that don't understand how terrible this place is.

The service usually is sub-par and that is only topped by the lack of quality food.  It's bland, you could do better at home style cooking.  The salad bar lacks true options, and for this type of food why not just go to Denny's where you're getting somewhat better food at a better price.

People that like this place are usually collecting social security checks and trying to get home and in bed before the 5 O'clock news starts."}
{"text":"Had a Friday night dinner with my Aunt & Uncle. It's been a long time since I was back home and ate here.  They didn't disappoint.  Standard fare and quality at a great price.  They're a local institution. I did however top off my dinner with a couple cookies to go for my evening treat."}
{"text":"I enjoy Eat N' Park in Uniontown but this one can't compare.  We were seated quickly but it went downhill after that. Syrup was all over the table and it stuck to my forearms! When I asked the server to wipe it off, she didn't say one word and wiped it quickly like it was an imposition for her.
My iced tea was strong. My scrambled eggs were over cooked  and tasteless. To top it all off, some guy sitting at the bar actually ripped a loud one like he was at a beer garden! Lol. Disgusting experience!!"}
{"text":"Crystal was our friendly, attentive server. Although the breakfast buffet looked tempting, we opted to order from the menu. Breakfast burritos were tasty as was the eggs and bacon. Good coffee too. Our first time at an Eat 'N Park. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this location. We had the breakfast buffet, and while the food was good, the service was not stellar. Our server largely ignored us in favor of chatting with the table next to us. She also seemed put out when we ordered a frozen mocha. (?) Not impressed."}
{"text":"Well first off, our waitress Molly was incredible. Super friendly and helpful. Food was ok- hamburger was on a grease soaked bun and the quesadilla was drenched in this chipotle sauce. Salad bar was not so great- the lettuce was swimming in water and so were half the other condiments. The potato soup was great. Probably won't be back at this location since I've had better experiences elsewhere."}
{"text":"The one in Bethel Park is bad for the money they charge! Every Time we had breakfast buffet we were disappointed ! Half hot entrees were cold the bacon was congealed and it wasn't worth the cost!  The waitress came 2 x only never asking us if we needed anything only to appear w check in hand! Never again!"}
{"text":"Oh No No No! Do you like paying nearly $10.00 for breakfast? A small breakfast that is! I ordered 2 eggs scrambled that were so small like 1 single egg only. 3 pieces of cold congealed grease on bacon 1 small Hash Brown 2 pieces toast cold rubbery& coffee lukewarm! I still was hungry after eating this child's breakfast size! I ordered Potato Pancakes which were baby hash browns not p pancakes. They Used to be like a crispy mash potato oniony cake and were good! This was those hash brown crowns they sell frozen in grocery store! And A side of sausage links that were cold and burned too! W tip it was $10.00 and next time IHop"}
{"text":"Tommorow I& my CareAttendant are going here to try their whale of a tale cod fish sandwich I hope its a better experience Than the ugh. Breakfast I had there awhile ago well after a year of not eating here; My friend and I went last friday to have their A whale of a fish sandwich we werent thrilled . The fish wasnt cod it was like some one ground the fish like a fish stick- and coleslaw wasn't fresh. Or sweet as it used to be! My milkshake vanilla wasnt  mixed properly like tasted more like milk wheres the ice-cream? We were very disappointed and said for what they charged w a terrible sandwich like this we will eat at Bobs dinner at least for same price $8.99 you get almost 2 Lbs fish thats fresh unhappy cookies here!"}
{"text":"We come here a LOT and are usually quite happy. The fried pickles are ridiculously good!! Decent off street parking, good selection, open 24 hours and the staff is usually great."}
{"text":"You kind of get what you pay for here. It's your basic food at a basic price. I particularly like the salad bar over everything. The burgers are good as are the chicken dishes. Superburger combo for 7.99 or the Angusburger special for 10.99. 
Grab a piece of pie for 2.99 as of this review."}
{"text":"Eat n Park is the place for smiles, but mine is kind of that emoji that has a squiggly line. 
Thins I like about EnP:
1. You always know what you're getting. Standard across the board. 
2.Pies great. Baked goods great. 
3. Soup good. 
4. Who doesn't love a Smiley cookie? 
5. They are a charitable group and I think that's awesome. 

Things that make me squiggly smile. I ordered the basic breakfast smile the other day. I asked to hold the toast and potatoes and swap a fruit cup. Get the less-than-half-cup of fruit and it's sub par. Yes, winter, but isn't their ideal to use what is in season? I can still find some sort of fruit in grocery store that's decent and you're a major chain! Find a supplier. What really was disappointing was that my server up-charged me 1.99 for less-than-half-cup. Now I have worked in the past for many years. Yes, some swaps do require an additional charge, but really? I just gave you back potatoes and toast for clear fruit. She did take it off, but I'm sure she was doing what is practice. So if I would have paid for that it would have been over 10 bucks for two eggs, two pieces of bacon (which is a buck a piece on up charge on friend's sandwich) and coffee and basically three bites of fruit. 

Eat n Park is the place for squiggly smiles."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to Eat'n Park for their midnight buffet for the last four years and boy was I disappointed. 

We arrive around 12:15am and are seated promptly. The server comes over, brings water, and states she will be back soon. Another 10 minutes and we order the buffet and I add a waffle with sides of whipped cream and strawberries (I was watching a lot of Parks and Rec and I had a craving). 

5-10 minutes later we ask the waitress if we can take the lids off of the buffet that is still half full and not uncovered yet. She states she is unsure, but will find out for us. At around 12:30, my friend gets up and starts taking kids off of the buffet. Other customers and myself get up and start filling our plates.

The buffet looks okay. I spot waffles, which I did not know they offered on the buffet, and I'm a little annoyed I ordered a side waffle without the waitress telling me that they were already on the buffet. Everything I get from the buffet is mediocre. I can't even decide if I'm mad about he waffles because they were the best thing I had all night. 

It takes us longer than usual to get our check and we're not sure why. The server seems a little frazzled, but it's not that busy and there doesn't seem to be a lot going on at 1am. I make a comment about not realizing the buffet already serves waffles when I ordered, and she states that the buffet didn't have waffles with strawberries and whipped cream and I pay the extra $7 the waffle. I feel disappointed, but also somewhat uncomfortable as I speed walk out of the Eat'n Park and the whole awkward experience."}
{"text":"You usually can't go wrong with a quick, inexpensive meal from a classic restaurant like Eat N Park. We usually eat breakfast here which is always fast and hot. Dinner we almost always do carry out. When picking up carry out they open up every box to make sure you get everything you ordered. While you wait they also offer you a drink which is great hospitality! Staff is super friendly and kind."}
{"text":"We've had nothing but issues here ranging from the food to the mobile app and coupons. The latest was a free cookie to which they had none available but had 20 6packs available for purchase. Don't bother writing to eat n park because they don't respond."}

{"text":"Typical diner type food. Ordered the American Scrambler but I should have read the description better? It was an egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel. I was expecting eggs scrambled with cheese along with bacon, a toasted bagel and hash browns. I ended up separating it all out but the eggs were definitely not scrambled. Not sure what coffee they serve, but definitely was not a fan of it. Barely drank it, no interest in refills, just should have stuck with water.

Others with rdered the meat lovers omelette and the salad bar.

We ordered a slice of Dutch apple pie for an aunt who we poorly communicated with...so a 'sorry' pie slice.

Benefit of this place is they are open 24/7. I always take comfort in places I can go any time of the night or morning. Wahoo!"}
{"text":"The waitress is really nice and friendly! Lasagne is fantastic, the smiley cookie is a little bit disappointing though."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant I'm there frequently but there is one employee there that works the salad bar/buffet that is horrible.  He is short, stocky and has a beard. If he does not like you he will make snide comments and give you rude looks as he walks past you. This has happened 2 times in the Past four days.   I hope someone reads this and gives him proper customer service training"}
{"text":"I went here for super late night eats a few weeks ago.  I was really pleased with the service.  Waitress was friendly, atmosphere is really nice and in line with other Eat'n Parks, but a little more updated.  I got a Smiley Cookie fresh out of the oven and it was fantastic.  It's kind of small, so I can imagine it would get crowded pretty quickly during regular hours.  The only problem I had was the side order of fries was incredibly small.  Like, 10 fries.  But other than that, I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"I used to love eating here. Good food and service and great salad bar - - BUT:

Last 4 visits, the service was VERY slow. Seating was SLOW, Server was SLOW to take order, food was really SLOW to come up.   Paying at register for pie was very SLOW.  And - they weren't busy!

It feels poorly managed and not well staffed.  

This is no longer our go to lunch and dinner spot until they figure this out."}
{"text":"Im from Arizona and we dont have any of these restaurants out here nor do we have many restaurants with buffet that actually taste good but went to PA to visit and so glad we ate here.  I ordered the buffet for breakfast cant go wrong with that right! it has a little bit of everything hash , ham n eggs, waffles, pancakes, bacon just to name a few things and it was delish.  The ice tea was also on point tasted very fresh and our waitress was very friendly.  Now you dont have to order the buffet they have a menu as well that you can order from and we went on the weekend so i didnt even think to ask if the buffet was weekend only but i will definitely go here again when in PA."}
{"text":"I was in earlier tonight placed my take out order which was the whale of a cod deal a side and all that the morons behind the front counter messed up my order never ever placing a take out order from here again! Not impressed at all! Maybe instead of being on there phones in the back and worrying about going out drinking after work and getting the customers orders right then you would have more people in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would love to eat here every day.  The food is delicious.  And the Salad Bar always has a great selection.  The only bad part is the Cream of Broccoli soup is way to thin.  They need to go back to the drawing board there.  And the employees are so friendly they treat you like family.  Highly recommend SuperBurger with a Salad Bar side."}
{"text":"Going downhill quickly,  everything was unavailable that I tried to order.  And no more sugar-free pie"}
{"text":"Eat'n Park is a low grade, low quality place to get your meals. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with the service or the staff, (who were very pleasant and competent by the way) actually the staff is probably the reason this isn't a one star review.

The food itself was very poorly prepared. My friend got an omelet and hash browns and the omelet looked like it was made of wax. The hash browns went untouched as they seemed to be taken straight from the frozen, shrink wrapped packaging and popped in the microwave for 20 seconds. 

The restaurant wasn't very clean and our table was sticky when we sat down. I mean if you're going to eat at this level you'd do much better at IHOP or even Waffle House. I think the only way I see myself ever coming back is if I am stranded in a desert and come across one in a small oasis...even then... :/"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about going, but am always pleasantly surprised once I'm there. The Squirrel Hill location is much more low-key than most of the other Eat'n'Park restaurants in the area, and is probably the best place for families in the city. The buffet is free for kids when an adult purchases it, so there is a great selection for my kids to choose from (in addition to the extensive kids' menu), and we can all get exactly what we like! This location is clean, service is always good, and it's never crowded."}
{"text":"Voice from the past:
I used to cruise \"Eat 'n Park\" back during 1963 - 1966 when I was in the Air Force stationed at Oakdale, Pa.
The burgers, fries, and drinks were always great.
The attraction was that we boys would cruise and park and meet girls whom came there by the carload for the same purpose.
My best friend met his future wife that way.
Car Hop service was unique and a fun experience.
I'd not thought of \"Eat 'n Park\" in a long time but one of my associates on Facebook mention it as a memory and I looked for the restaurant on the Internet to find that they are still in business after all these year!
Your company has grown and expanded quite well over the years.
Congratulations."}

They just new menus. Didn't really seen new items, perhaps just new prices or nicer design.
Great for folks with preferences; they have obvious marks for vegen and veggies options as well as low fat."}
{"text":"I am doing it.  I am going to say that I am a big fan of the Eat n'Park.  Yes, I understand that it isn't the newest hippest joint, but, you know what?  I know what I am getting every time, and for me, I like that.  I like that I can get the grilled stickies with my eggs and know exactly what they will taste like.    Sometimes you need consistency and comfort.  That is why I really dig the Eat N' Park.  My coffee stays full and the bill at the end is not bank account draining.  I always leave with a smile."}
{"text":"The new place is really nice and clean. Always enjoy stopping for a super griddle smile. You can never go wrong with an EnP stop. Ignore the negative review."}
{"text":"It was a nice place to take my in-laws when we visited them.  The place is clean and the waitress was nice to my demanding in-laws (since they are in their 90s).  They have a decent buffet items to choose from, but ends at 10:30 sharp!"}
{"text":"Disclosure: this was my first time in quite a few years visiting an Eat'n Park, a local chain I knew and loved growing up.  I will update this review after I visit again but feel the need to post my experience.  Stopped in for breakfast after a family member picked me up at the airport, which is close by.  I ordered an egg white mushroom omelet and asked if they could add some spinach to it.  Is this an unreasonable or outrageous request?  I didn't think it was too much to ask, and was more than willing to pay extra for the addition.  So the waitress brought our food, and my omelet had no spinach. I brought it to her attention, but since I already had taken a couple of bites, told her I don't want a whole new omelet -- but asked if they could just give me a little spinach on the side?  So she proceeds to bring out a small plate of raw spinach. ??? This is a breakfast omelet, not a salad. I clarified that I was asking for sautéed spinach, to go in/on my omelet as I said originally.  So here is what she brought me (see photo).  Well the picture actually makes it look better than in person. Apparently the cook  took the plate and threw it in the microwave or something. Absolutely ridiculous!  Eat'n Park:  if you want to stay stuck in the late 80's/early 90's, that is your problem.  People like to have options, e.g. more vegetables in their omelets these days, other than onions or red & green bell peppers that are swimming in butter and oil. Please train your cooks and servers a little better."}
{"text":"This location is extremely average!  If you've been to an Eat'n Park, you'll know what to expect.  The people working here are friendly, but the whole operation is a bit dodgy.

For example:  they were out of plates; the dishwasher was down.  So everybody had styrofoam plates and plastic silverware.  I know, stuff happens (but I've never seen this at any other restaurant, ever).

Eat 'n Park features it's soup and salad bar, right?  Well, these folks closed it down while changing over from Bruch to Lunch/Dinner.  Having just bought it as park of my lunch, what was I to do?  It takes them 30 minutes to change it over.  They let me make a salad (they were out of soup, or took it away), but I did so in the DARK (lights off means \"bar closed,\" apparently).

So it's decent, no real problems, just a bit weird."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and we stopped at EatnPark after a night out. The place looks defect, the food greasy and no flavor. The best thing of this place it's Geoffrey ! (I think that's his name) he take the time to serve you.  If you come to this location ask for Geof, and you will be taking care of!"}
{"text":"Limited Time $2 pies, pies, pies!

My friends and I got 5 different pies:

- Peachberry: 10/10, the combo is amazing and that perfectly baked crust, mmm.
- Apple: 8/10, better than average apple pie
- Oreo Creme: 6/10, your standard oreo creme pie
- Blackberry: 3/10, oddly sweet... not in a good way
- Strawberry creme: 1/10, under-baked pie crust, uncut strawberries, strawberry jelly/syrup, whipped cream, no thanks.

We also got the hand-breaded zucchini. The first few zucchinis were good. As we got toward the bottom of the basket, they were drenched in oil. Yuck.

Waitress was friendly, but wasn't very attentive. This might've been because we got say away from the rest of the crowd. Still no excuse though on a slow Sunday night.

+ side: THEY ACCEPT DINEX yay."}
{"text":"They are open until 3am at night. Almost every time I reach Pittsburgh late at night I head for some food here. Prices are reasonable,service is fine. Food is ok and this place stays open when nothing else is."}
{"text":"Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00

On this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.

My baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. 

The waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet."}
{"text":"This location doesn't sing the birthday song for kids birthdays. My daughter was really disappointed. Shame on me for assuming the chain would have a universal policy. The server did put a candle in her pie which I appreciated."}
{"text":"It's Mother's Day and my waitress (from the older generation) just assumed that my mother was mother. She gave her a cookie and then continued on to the other tables. NOT ONCE was it assumed that I could've been a mother too. I am 20 and I think this is age discrimination. Meanwhile this establishment is showering a grumpy old man with foods of his delight. Maybe if I throw silver ware into the aisle as this man did maybe I can get my Mother's Day cookie. I'm not actually a mother but I wish it could've been taken into consideration that I could've been. That's all."}
{"text":"This is an A-OK Eat n' Park.  The salad bar was fresh, but some items needed to be replenished (there was some left, but not much...).  Service was as expected - good.

I would go here again."}
{"text":"Food was hot and good and our waiter was pleasant. We beat the Sunday rush, which is always a good thigh in my book. Coffee wasn't bad, although the thick-rimmed mugs made it hard to drink out of, I thought. I ordered an omelette and it was pretty plentiful. My friend however, ordered some healthy dish and the turkey sausage looked disgraceful. She also ordered egg whites instead of scrambled eggs and, um, let's just keep it simple and say an order of 2 whites will not be nearly enough in the future. But boy did they pile on the toast! No skimping there, lol... I wanted to trade her dishes... Poor thing. Prices are decent and you can't really argue with them for the meal that you get. A smiley cookie made it all better, in the end. 


Update: 7/3/16- late night 
I don't know what's with this place but it lost a star for inconsistency last night. I'm not going to write a whole other review, but I'll simply list below the reasons I've decided to drop a star

- didn't get silverware upon sitting down 
-table was dirty when we arrived 
-gave me a small \"sample size\" cup of ranch for my salad when that's not what I'm typically served with 
-I had 3 pieces of bread on my buff chicken salad and when I asked if there was a 4th missing, waitress said, \"it must have fallen off and I forgot to put it back on. If you want another one, I can make it for you?\" 
-husband had a 5 French fries for his side 
-asked for onions added to my salad, didn't happen
- asked for extra napkins and waitress also asked us if we wanted plates for the apps. We said yes... Neither happened.
-waitress did not apologize for any of these issues
-had to ask another waitress to bring the check because ours avoided us after all these incidents. 

Not to mention, there was a manager on duty who chose to not check in. 

This place's saving grace was the pleasant hostess and the fact the food still tasted good. I hope they can step it up!"}
{"text":"Ya Can't go wrong with this place tis a Pittsburgh pastime!"}
{"text":"Much better than the Banksville location. Everyone here is very friendly and makes me feel welcome. One of the best Eat'n Park restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm... Eat 'n Park. The name conjures up thoughts of a more innocent era, where families drove up to the diner in their old fashioned Corvettes and station wagons to have a wholesome meal crafted by competent cooks and served up by engaging waitstaff. Not to mention... Eat 'n Park was once known for their carhops back before Sonic made carside foodservice cool.

This Eat 'n Park is no exception. I arrived here with my brother and a high school friend, stumbling in at 1 AM from a final showing of The Expendables 3 at the Destinta (or whatever it's called now) movie theater down the road. Suffice to say, it felt like home and I got right to the menu. After glancing at the plastic folded sheet for all of a few minutes, I was waited on by a very helpful gentleman by the name of RJ. Despite being rather understaffed, he handled taking my order, refilling my beverage AND keeping the place clean all on his own.

Of course, I had to have the legendary SuperBurger, albeit the jucier Black Angus version for just over a dollar more. It arrived nice and hot off the grill with a side of french fries and a pickle. Although I couldn't finish it and had to take a doggy bag home, I savored the bites I did take and cherished the moment, since this was the first time I've had the burger in over a year since I left the Pittsburgh area to live in California. Let me say this folks... I truly miss out on the food when I'm in Cali. It just isn't the same for me. 

Needless to say, I thanked RJ for his hospitality as he rang us up at the register on our way out the door. I hope to be back at this location again in the future."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average Eat'n Park, which is \"A-OK,\" and very decent.

This is a standard EnP - the layout, the large salad/fruit/soup bar, the booths, etc.  It's fairly large and they can process lots of diners.  Here's how I break it down:

THE GOOD:
- It's big and they are well staffed, so they can process lots of customers.
- They keep the salad bar clean and the veggies are fresh.
- The dining room is clean.
- The service is generally very pleasant.
- The food is fresh.  Get a burger or sandwich and the bun is so soft and fresh, you'd bet it was baked an hour ago.
- The noodles in the Chicken Noodle Soup are thick and excellent.  I swear they are homemade noodles.  Amazing.

THE NOT SO GOOD:
- The soup bowls are dirty.  They often have a few dirty bowls that previous diners have had to set aside.
- Sometimes I wait quite a while at the greeter stand to be seated.  (They may have a shift-change at 12:00 noon and may drop the ball at hand-off time.)

So overall, this is a solid 3-Star restaurant.  And do NOT miss those noodles in the Chicken Noodle Soup!!"}
{"text":"Eat n Park is a typical low end restaurant. The staff was double what the crowd required. Too many people wandering around doing nothing. Our waitress tried her best to be polite and interested but it just seemed so forced. The food itself was terrible. Most of us has some special burger that ended up being their \"attempt\" at duplicating a Big Mac. No cheaper than a Big Mac meal so why go to there for it? Because nothing else looked worthwhile. It's only the second time I've been to an Eat n Park and now I remember why it took years to go again. Won't be a third......"}
{"text":"If you would have asked me the past 6 months how I would rate my weekly experience at this Eat n Park, I would've given them 4-5 stars.  I don't even normally care to review chain restaurants, but after today's performance, I am so frustrated I really hope their management monitors this page.

I placed my office's normal order over the phone with a male and was told my order would be available in 20-25 minutes max because their kitchen was busy.  When I showed up, there was apparently no record of my order and the woman asked if I wanted to place a rush order.  I asked her if she could please check with the few males who would have answered the phone to see what happened as I had already waited quite some time of my lunch break to pick it up.  She came back out and said nobody had any idea what happened.  She then accused me of \"probably calling the wrong store, in Cranberry,\" so I took out my phone and showed her the call to this exact location.  Annoyed, she said \"yes, that's us....so what can I get you?\"  I placed my order and she hurried off.  Within about 10 minutes, I had my takeout order and was standing in the line to pay....again.

I am not annoyed that I wasted 30 minutes of my lunch break sitting and waiting for the food.  I'm not even annoyed that my order was somehow misplaced.  and I'm not even annoyed that the entire 30 minutes I was there, a screaming baby was sitting behind me while his mother let him cry and disturb the entire restaurant.  I am annoyed that this woman couldn't even express so much as a simple \"I apologize for the confusion\" and on top of that, accused ME that it was MY mistake!  I work in customer service and this is a piss-poor way to handle an easily-resolved situation.

When I got back to my office and opened the bag, one of the containers that was carelessly thrown in it had exploded and made a huge mess over multiple peoples' food.  My burger with the over-easy egg on top was actually a burger with a raw egg/runny egg-white on top.  So all of that fiasco for me to not even be able to eat my lunch.

Maybe I'll update my review because I normally do have a good experience, but today was just inexcusable and did I mention, annoying?"}
{"text":"Great service from start to finish. They even brought back the bruschetta chicken which is highly recommended. Great prices and had a really good time. Very clean also."}
{"text":"The absolute worst!!! This restaurant \"claims\" to have a celiac friendly menu. But don't believe it at all.... 

 I specifically said I need to order of this menu, the server spoke with the manager. Confirming they would be able to accommodate my needs no problem. When they brought my burger, I saw my bun was different than another who also ordered one. Again thinking this my be a gluten free bun. I took a bite immediately recognizing it was a regular (gluten filled) bun. Sadly I confirmed this with the manager. But it was too late.

This is not a place to go if you have allergies of any sort. Don't make the same mistake I did and trust them with your health! You will be very sick. They obviously do not follow the practices they \"claim\" to cooking your meal in a separate allergen free area. 

I will never go to and eat n park again....."}
{"text":"It's okay. Doesn't have food that'll blow you out of the water, but it's not bad grub either. It's your standard diner fare, with sandwiches, pies, cakes, milkshakes, salads, and the works. The one nice thing they do have is the Midnight Breakfast Buffet, which might be worth considering if you're really a fan of eating loads of breakfast food. However, it's not really enough to offset giving it any higher of a rating."}
{"text":"I come here once a week on business.
Service & Food are always good.
BUT Not sure if I will be back again.?
Seems Manager has attitude with customers
and we felt uncomfortable being there.
Think they called him Mikey.?
Oh well think we may go over to BE."}
{"text":"We occasionally stumble in here; hungry, and just a bit drunk. The servers are always very nice and they keep our coffee cups filled. The food is ok and it's nice to be able to linger over pie afterwards. 

Overall, a decent place to linger after  a fun night on the town."}
{"text":"I just have to say, Regina is the best. She was attentive and efficient, two of my favorite qualities! Seriously though, she was fantastic. This is a 24 hour location, so you know the staff deals with jerks, but you would never know based on the smiles and warm greetings...even at 3 am. 

Eat, visit, tip. Regina is great!"}
{"text":"Place is completely disgusting. Check the layer of syrup under the shelves in the back...kitchen is totally inconsistent and typically on the awful side. Ordered chips with a burger to go. Burger tasted like some kind of chemical. Assuming it's from the general lack of sanitary conditions, and the chips were totally raw. Like they literally forgot to cook them. 

Past occasion got a salad with a hair that was unbelievably long."}
{"text":"So here we are more than a month later and not so much as an apology or a refund for the wrong pies and the spilled soup.  I filled out the on line form.
I even went back 3 days later for breakfast in the restaurant with 2 friends and breakfast was completely inedible. The manager took the check AFTER belittling us and being snide and rude when I told her that I had missed her call because it was conveniently during work hours. She told me the complaint was invalid and not believable and they had it taped....please review the tape.....soup spilled...person at the window was clueless and wrong pies ....all which was paid for.  I gave you way too many chances. Your food when cooked right is mediocre ...your staff is horribly trained. Your managers are unhelpful and you wasted money re- doing the banks vile eat and park...money would have been better used to teach your cooks how to make real eggs..not the freeze dried carton eggs that you use on the Buffet. 
IF....BIG IF we ever go to Eat n Park again it will be the Dormont one..the food is still not great but the servers there are friendly. HUGE Difference.  Please train the staff at the Banksville E&p..they need it Badly."}
{"text":"Went last weekend. Service was extremely slow. Not sure if they were understaffed? The restaurant was only maybe 1/4-1/3 full. Another table sat for 10 minutes before a server walked by and asked if anyone had been by. When they said no, that server yelled to the hostess to ask who's section it was. 
People seemed to be constantly trying to hunt down a server. Food was also very slow to come out. It was ok food, not the greatest. Has been better in the past."}
{"text":"1st time in new layout.  great place!  they're still working out a few glitches.  very friendly staff.  quick and efficient.  Superburger forever!  (50 years ago as a teenager i ate 2 at a seating at the rt51 carrick location)  in case you don't know history this is their answer after they dropped the big boy franchise.  If it was not for the Big Boy and superburger there would not be a big Mac (invented in western PA in response to the BB and SB which does extremely well here when 15 cent mckyd's weren't hitting it .  sister had buffalo chicken BIG salad with garlic toast.  she liked it (so did I).  wish i could have had one of their sundae's but.  best place of this type in the burgh!"}
{"text":"My late night go-to place when I get a hunger attack in Pittsburgh! I loved it.  Have one of the Smile Breakfasts, they are very tasty and satisfy the munchies without overstuffing your belly.  Plus ,  Excellent service!  Denny's doesnt hold a candle to this eatery!"}
{"text":"Of course I move from Pittsburgh in 2012 and Eat N Park gets a gluten free menu-REALLY?
Anywho-I find this out onm a brief trip back to the \"burg\" so of course I need to go test the waters and try out their gluten free stuff. 

They have a pretty good gluten free menu-burgers, salads, breakfast food, breakfast sandwiches. Better then most places so-called GF menus. 

Jason and I both ordered gluten free breakfast sandwiches-his with sausage, mine with bacon (everything is better with bacon). 

The service was good, quick and the food came out hot and fast. They use the burger bun for the breakfast sandwich bun-so it was a little too much bread but you can easily take off thebottom. Both sandwiches tasted exactly how they should for breakfast sandwiches. 
Both meals came with american fries (I swear they used to have a different potatoe when I lived there) and a side of fruit. When I ordered I assumed it was either/or but ours came with both. 
The potatoes were good and had flavor, althought I feel they could have given me a few more. The fruit-surprisingly was very fresh tasting and didnt taste like it was out a mass fruit bucket which most restaurants order. 

Price was fair, gluten free buns cost .50 more, the sandwich meals were $7.00 and Jason ordered coffee so our bill was around $18.00 I think. 

Place was clean and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"I'd been staying away from EnP for a while as the Pittsburgh dining scene has grown, but they do remain one of the few 24-hour eateries, and the redesign of the facade got me curious.

So what's the dining experience like? Solidly OK. It's not great food, but it's not bad. I do think you can get better diner food, cheaper, in a lot of places around town. But at 3AM? Especially if you're not in a state to drive to Denny's down on McKnight? This always has been, and remains, a decent choice.

The service is hit-or-miss, but usually fine. It more depends on the clientele that might be there on any given night. The more jags who have come to eat, the longer it'll take for your coffee to be refreshed. I don't envy the waitstaff's plight.

The quesadilla is serviceable, as is the turkey club on rye. You can't go wrong with any of the fried stuff, either -- cheesesticks, fries, et al.

Honestly? The redesign of this place is purely cosmetic. This is the same Eat n Park you remember from high school, minus the smoking.  

A parting note: the men's urinal was shaped like the Triforce. But whether that constitutes an endorsement or a condemnation is really up to you."}
{"text":"Decent food and good service. But the kitchen is sooooo slow. Took 25 minutes for some very simple kids meals and a fish sandwich. Not acceptable with little kids."}
{"text":"We have visited this location multiple times and this time was just not up to par. It was Mother's Day and I understand it will be busy but this was just ridiculous. Our group arrived around 5pm. The hostess asked if we wanted to all sit together. Of course we do! After an hour of waiting for them to arrange tables they took us back to the party room. Which was totally open. Yes, we were a bit upset that we had to wait extra time. 

Other than that the waitress was very kind and helpful. The food was good as always."}
{"text":"Is it a Pittsburgh thing? Maybe so but that is no excuse for this crumby diner chain. The few times I have dined (if that's what you want to call it) at an E'nP I felt like committing Sepaku (Hari - Kiri). I never got sick from the food but more disgusted with myself for stooping to this level of gastronomy. Nothing really worthwhile on the menu (maybe a burger- how much can you mess that up?). My gut just tells me not to trust E 'N Ps.  No offense to truck drivers of America b/c they keep supplies on our selves but It  reminds me of a truck stop restaurant without the truck drivers. I always seem to migrate to the salad bar and get weirded out for having to deal with the utensils that pick up the salad. So I wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff. The waterfront  E 'N P is perhaps the cleanest one I have been to but that's not saying much b/c the patrons are kinda off. So an extra star for this location. But it's not like I would ever say to my friends in NY, SF, London or wherever...\"Hey when you come to Pittsburgh be sure to go to an E 'N P to get the flavor of the city\". Obviously this place appeals to a certain class of people of which I guess I can't be a part of as much as I want to be at times."}
{"text":"I understand that these eateries can be a fun hangout but that is no excuse for this crumby diner chain. I have been to the Sq.

{"text":"My girlfrind and I were in Moon, PA visiting family. Arrived late on a flight from LAX and luckily stumbled into this chain of reataurants. (its like Dennys... just better) great food, friendly staff. Now we're back in LA did a search in google maps and found one in Burbank!!"}
{"text":"While we were in Western Pennsylvania, I wanted to be sure to try an Eat'n Park. Eat'n Park is a traditional American coffee shop chain, right out of the 1950s and 1960s. It's not retro, it's what retro themed restaurants are trying to emulate. It's the original.

Eat'n Park was a major East Coast franchisee of Bob's Big Boy until the 1970s. Bob's was a place my family would always go in California in the 1960s and I loved the Big Boy Hamburger. So a chance to experience that ambiance again was very enticing, perhaps clouding my perceptions.

The outside of this Eat'n Park location has been modernized, but inside was a Googie style coffee shop that looked just like a Bob's! The menu offers straightforward American food with no pretentions. I had to have the Original Superburger Deal. The cheeseburger was close, very close, to a Big Boy. My wife had one of the more contemporary burger offerings, a Classic Black Angus Cheeseburger. I was satisfied, though a burger from Red Robin or Cheeseburger in Paradise is a better choice. (Yes, they are better, but this was a nostalgia meal for me.) We both had Salad Bar. The Soup and Salad Bar was nice, with a variety of different vegetables and salad toppings available. We shared a slice of Key Lime Pie for dessert, and it was very good.

On a second visit, we came to try breakfast. This was very good, better than the burger. Both my wife and I ordered omelettes. I tried the Western Omelette and found it quite satisfying."}
{"text":"The food is typical of Eat & Park; however, the service was stellar. As a gluten free diner, I was impressed with the knowledge and conscientiousness of our server George. He took great care of my meal (grilled chicken salad without fries) and even picked up on my gluten sensitivity after seeing me order off the gluten friendly menu and not touch any of the buns or fried appetizers that the rest of my party had ordered.

Thanks, George and Eat & Park, for a safe and enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"Much like the other reviewers have said, I agree that this particular location is average at best.

I went inside to place a takeout order (gluten free chargrilled chicken salad without fries) and while I was waiting, I got to spend roughly 15 minutes watching hostesses complain and talk to each other and a pretty unfriendly woman who I'm pretty sure was the manager on the phone with what sounded like a customer who had just left. 

One positive thing is that my server Maureen was knowledgable about what gluten free meant. She even mentioned that she did not include any bread with my salad because I ordered off the GF menu. Props to her for taking that extra step. 

My order came correct with plenty of dressing; however, the lettuce was slightly warm and the chicken lukewarm. It was OK, but nothing special. 

Next time I'd probably try the location near Pittsburgh Mills. I wasn't super impressed here."}
{"text":"What am I doing reviewing an Eat'n Park? It's Eat'n Park, what do you expect? You want eggs, you get eggs! They over-butter the toast and cook the beef until it's brown in the middle whether you like it or not. It's the place that you can go, and bring your entire family, and know what to expect: friendly people and decent food.

If you're looking for anything other than greasy breakfast food, a buffet with amazing corn fritters, or a perfectly average burger just go somewhere else.

What sets this Eat'n Park apart from every other one is the great outdoor seating that no one uses! I have no idea why! We'll come here for breakfast on a beautiful spring day and be the only weirdos out there, enjoying the weather.

Eat'n Park is a Pittsburgh institution that I'm glad to be a life-long customer of."}
{"text":"Decent meals at reasonable prices.  Ok, I ended up here because Thursday night is a happening night in Medina - Longhorn and Applebees had no parking left in their lots.

 I went for Mile High Meatloaf, thats Italian bread toasted with 2 pieces of meatloaf,  mash potatoes, 2 onion rings and gravy over top of this stack of food.  Actually, good meatloaf with pieces of green pepper and onion inside.  The potatoes maybe from a box, or spent some serious time under a heat lamp, kind of dried out.  Salad bar is a good value at $2 to substitute for another side. The salad bar has really good soup, Thursday night - Wedding Soup, but chili and chicken noodle are usually there too.  The veggies on bar were very fresh and tasty.  

Baked Cod Floridian was a piece of fish baked in orange juice.  It looked pretty bland, but was ok.  Probably better choice is Nantucket Cod, of course its better because of stuffing with crab, shrimp, cheese...."}
{"text":"Eat 'n Park is a Pittsburgh staple. This location is open 24 hours - great for a late night stop coming home from the city. The food is pretty basic \"diner\" style food, nothing too bad, nothing too great. They have a pretty good breakfast menu, which is what I always go for."}
{"text":"I think I've said this before, but I love breakfast food. If there's ever a chance for a breakfast meeting, I'm in! This Eat'n Park location is close to my office, and my friend and I grabbed breakfast this morning before heading into work. Their food is always pretty good, and I very rarely have any complaints. It's a Pittsburgh staple, along with their smiley cookies!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't loveeeeeee Eat'n Park? My bf and I do! We stopped at this location for a New Years Day brunch. The service was a little slow, but the food is always good and no one was in a hurry. It was a great spot to ease into the new year!"}
{"text":"This location gets the same rating as the other two I've reviewed. (I know I know, I definitely make my rounds at the Eat'n Parks around the city...Don't judge!) I go here every Tuesday morning - I'm involved in a networking group and we meet for breakfast weekly. They have a great back room with doors to close out the noise and it's perfect for our group of 15. We all order breakfast, and we have our meeting, eat, and are done by 9am. They are really quick and efficient and that's appreciated from everyone within our group. This is also a 'diner style' Eat'n Park with a cafe area in front. It's also right at the intersection of Rt. 910 and I-79, so if you're traveling through the area it's a good place to stop at for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Service was just \"ok\" and the restaurant was super hot inside.  I would go back if I am in a hurry for diner food but I kind of like Dennys better."}
{"text":"We like to go here and get the salad bar. The green pistacio fluff at the salad bar is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Eat N' Park is awesome.  I don't know why people keep doggin' on it.  It's got down-home food, both healthy and... not so healthy... for super cheap prices.  I went there for brunch/breakfast on a Sunday morning.

The bananas foster french toast is a total sugar bomb, but tastes *awesome*.  If you're in the mood for something lighter (even by California standards), you can get an egg white scramble with wheat toast or cottage cheese with fruit.  I didn't stay for lunch, but I did notice that the \"salad bar\" has fried chicken.  Woohoo!

C'mon, how can you hate a place which sells cookies with peace symbols on them?"}
{"text":"From the last time I was here it was a complete one-eighty.  Our service was way above average, in fact our waitress was amazing.  She was attentive and even doted over my niece, it felt great to be welcomed and accommodated this time around.

This visit I was here with a bigger party than last time, but that didn't stop us from receiving some of the best service I have ever had at an ENP.  Food is standard, especially if you are like me and enjoy the salad bar.  It's not the hugest salad bar, but it has enough items on it to feel your stomach and then some.

Oh, and I rediscovered the grilled stickies.  O M G!  I forgot how much those ooey gooey grilled sticky buns of gold could be the perfect ending to a healthy meal. ;)"}
{"text":"I have not been to this location is such a long time, and I have to say I am impressed.  Great job on the remodel.

Still a typical ENP however. 

We had superb service from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. The waitress was very attentive to our needs and stopped by frequently to check on us. 

The one bad thing I did notice was that space in here seems to have gone down. It doesn't feel as roomy as it once did. It's still the same space just rearranged to make it look more inviting."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It wasnt super busy and I had requested extra syrup for my waffle 5 mins later she brought that then I requested another fork for my pie and she never brought it. I spoke with the manager she said couldn't you use the fork you ate your other food with. Mind you it was covered in syrup."}
{"text":"It's nice to go into a place that was trying to capture the feel of a 1950s diner.  This place does it so flawlessly with adding in touches of modernization.  It's nice and comforting to be seated in a booth and have the staff there in a heartbeat to take your order.  Staff was so over-the-top nice that you kind of didn't want to leave.  The only draw back I found with the place is that the music can sometimes be too loud and makes for a flowing conversation difficult.

I enjoyed the endless soup/salad bar while my friend opted for only a slice of pie and some iced tea.  The salad bar was quite filling with their choices to top the salad with and their mix of different already made salads from cole slaw to broccoli salad.  If the night air had been a bit warmer we would have chose to sit outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Start with a Smiley Cookie and go from there. Great breakfast selections always, and very kid friendly. A Western PA institution."}
{"text":"The staff here were so sweet and accommodating for my three crazy kids.  They brought us everything we needed in a timely manner and checked often to make sure we were well taken care of.  Great place for families!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a lot as a freshman at CMU down the street-- mostly because we had money on our food dining card and it could be used for ENP.  This ENP is really easily accessible by the public buses that go from CMU to Squirrel Hill.  

Granted, this ENP is kinda old and could use some re-decorating (it feels like a blast from the past) but if you want OK/decent diner food for OK/decent prices, ENP is an option... I think some of their food was kinda greasy, and I remember a sandwich was that positively drowned in gravy.

I do recall that their shakes are actually pretty good.  I remember getting one that was mocha and it had an espresso bean on top of the whipped cream.  Totally didn't sleep that day.

Their smiley cookies are also good here too.  They're just plain sugar cookies with icing on the top and their silly face drawn on it - I mean you could get these iced cookies in the supermarket too but don't you want the smiley?  So happy!"}
{"text":"Good food with good service. The wait for the ordered food is a bit long. I tried around 5 different appetizers and among them the Hand-Breaded Zucchini was too oily."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I had to go out on a site visit today, so we stopped here for lunch afterwards.  Good ol' Eat 'n' Park!  There's just something so comforting, so reliable about it!  Kind of like your favorite pair of old jeans!  

And why do I even bother looking at the menu when most of the time I know what I'm gonna get?  A BLT with a cup of chicken noodle soup and a cup of their fabulous coffee!"}
{"text":"I was up in the Gibsonia area doing a site visit for work and...oh Hell, do I really need an excuse to stop at Eat n' Park?  Had me my favorite--a BLT with wedding soup and a couple of cups of Eat n' Park coffee.  

Yeah, I generally give Eat N' Park three stars.  That's because it's somewhat predictable, nothing fancy, but oh so reliable."}
{"text":"I've come here so often, I keep forgetting to update my review of the place.  So granted, it's been a few years since the remodeling job, but I love what they've done with the place.

Anyway it was another one of those nights where my husband and I were just too tired to cook.  Eat N Park?  You betcha!  It's just simply an old reliable that really fllls the bill when you need it.  And what could be better than a good ol' fashioned BLT or turkey club (in my case the latter) washed down with some Eat N Park coffee?"}
{"text":"Eat 'N Park has always been a good ol' reliable friend.  Nothin' fancy about it, but always reliable.  My cousin and I stopped in here after hiking in nearby South Park.  It'd been a damp, cold & overcast morning.  I have to say, after hiking about 6 miles or so on a crummy morning, three pancakes topped off with some good old Eat 'N Park coffee really hit the spot.   Mmmm!  What better way to warm up on a chilly April morning?"}
{"text":"Okay, I admit it!  I'm an Eat N Park junkie!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  It's a chain and probably not worth more than three stars.  Hey, the food here is dependable if nothing else.  There's no better basic lunch than an Eat N Park BLT topped off with a great cup of coffee.  Hits the spot every time!"}
{"text":"I've reviewed the Squirrel Hill Eat 'n' Park here http://www.yelp.com/biz/eat-n-park-pittsburgh#hrid:2FEe-uI0OAIoSMgCwAThAg
Even though I can only give Eat 'n' Park a three star review, I love Eat 'n' Park.  It's an old reliable.  The food is dependable, no-surprises comfort food.  The coffee is always good.  And there are times when chow like this just hits the spot!  Like last night.  I'm in a band and we were rehearsing nearby.  We took a dinner break and came over here.  The BLT I had was absolutely perfect.  Who doesn't like a good BLT?

Some of their other sandwiches I'd recommend are the grilled chicken , the turkey club, and the Santa Fe turkey bacon.  The dinners here aren't bad if you stick with the basic chicken or beef dishes.  I don't recommend the steaks or the spaghetti.  But the salads and soups here are good too.

So, yeah, the food here is unimaginative.  It won't surprise you but it'll definitely satisfy."}
{"text":"It's Eat 'n Park folks!  A good ol' fashioned reiliable.  It's a place you go to when you want comfort food or a decent lunch.  

It's also the perfect place to stop at after an autumn morning's hike.  My girlfriends and I did just that, figuring we wanted some soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.  I figured some soup and a BLT with some coffee would just hit the spot.  Saturday's soup was cream of broccoli.  Gack--I don't really like cream soups but the chicken noodle was just right.  My BLT was as always as reliable as ever.  And Eat 'n Park still has some of the best coffee around."}
{"text":"I have been going to Eat'n Park since I was little. Living in the middle of Ohio, the closest Eat'n Park to me is a 2 hour drive. So whenever I get a chance, I like to go.
My husband is not a fan of this restaurant whatsoever. Their food is just okay. 
We went to the location before heading out of town and back home with my dad. It was nice, because it definitely had a homey feeling to it, and brought me back to my childhood. The only access to the restaurant is if you are traveling southbound on McKnight road. If you are traveling northbound, you have to find a light and turn around. 
The food was good. I got a burger, my husband got the salad bar, and my daughter got a pancake. The salad bar wasn't anything spectacular, just a pretty standard salad bar. The burger was good.
I LOVE their smiley cookies, and always buy a box of them when we pass a location. These ones were really good."}
{"text":"I am from Pittsburgh, it's kind of necessary to go to Eat'n Park when I am in town as there aren't any in Columbus. Our waiter was super friendly, constantly making sure that we were taken care of, and that was the best thing about this trip.

The food was okay - we got the salad bar which I didn't realize would still have breakfast items on it. I was able to make it out with a  pack of cookies, which really is the only reason I visit Eat'n Park to begin with!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicer locations I've been to!  The HOT turkey sandwich was very salty and Luke warm.  The place was relatively clean. You basically get what you pay for!  It's a quick sit down fast food type of place.  The waitress was very kind and did a good job so I gave her a decent tip.  Otherwise only visit if you're starving and you don't have much time!  There were high school kids loitering outside, walking around the brick wall .  Again only visit if you have too!"}
{"text":"Eat'n Park is known for their \"Smiley\" cookie (like a chewy black-and-white sugar cookie, but white, with a smiley face drawn in icing).  My wife insisted on going to Eat'n Park on our trip to Pittsburgh.  But she hates the Smiley cookie.  What drew her was the strawberry pie.

The pie itself merits four stars.  It's inexpensive ($2.99, and a whole pie is less than $10) and bursting with fresh, huge berries.

Fried zucchini ($5-6) is listed as an appetizer, but is enough for a meal, and comes from a local farm in Butler.  The freshness really shows in the taste.  It's breaded with a cornmeal batter, which produced some really tragic consequences for me an hour later.  90 minutes after that, however, I no longer regretted eating the fried zucchini.  Yes, it was that good.  I wouldn't do it again, mind you, but in retrospect, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Classic Eat 'N Park experience. I've been here 3 or 4 times and have always had great service. 

I love the breakfast food, that's what I usually get. Waffles are amazing (better than IHOP) and they bring you hot syrup. Yum. 

The soup is also AMAZING and the salad bar is really good. If I ever go for lunch, I always get the soup and salad bar. Always a good choice. I love their sandwiches and all the desserts are top notch. 

If you need late night dessert options, their sundaes and milkshakes are so good. Get a sundae with some fries & gravy or with some fried zucchini! Yum!"}
{"text":"Eat n park has always been a place to go to grab a bite to eat. And no matter which one you go to it seems that the quaility of food is pretty consistent. The food was good which it always is but the reason i gave this Eat n Park 5 stars is because of service. From the moment we walked in to the hostesses that greeted us and our waitress who was awesome. Without getting descriptive i had an incident with my boy today. Lets just say his food didnt sit to well and the manager and waitress were very helpful and caring. And for that i thank them. I will definetly be back to this eat n park and recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"If you like to eat food that comes out of large cans then this is your place.  I am referring to the salad bar.  Once we ordered off the menu and I swear the mashed potatoes came out of a box.  But still, some people love this place and the prices are good."}
{"text":"Neighborhood chain. Good salad bar"}
{"text":"Poor managing today.  They are making people wait 20 minutes when they have 8 tables in main dinning area and many more that need bussed."}
{"text":"My first time coming with my hoppy and daughter. I like the american style of it. Waiters were nice but it was Sunday and its crowded and I waited long time to have my receipt. Food was delicious and perfect and the price is reasonable. Also my daughter got a free heart cookie and she was very happy about it."}
{"text":"I love this place. You can have buffets, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Awesome place. It's clean and the customer service is excellent. I will say they get busy and the wait can be dragging process, but overall they treat you with respect. The last time I was there I ate the seafood platter. It was a little dry, but the waitress was nice enough to bring more sauce. I never complain about the food because it is alway fresh. I do suggest it and would go there again and again!"}
{"text":"I went here with my ex and the kids whilst visiting from Columbus Ohio. I ordered a Chicken club sandwich which according to the menu came with either fries or mashed potatoes. My waitress never asked which I wanted and I forgot to say I wanted fries, NP I figured that they would just default to fries right.? WRONG, my sandwich came without fries or mashed potatoes so I asked if the fries were coming separably, the sandwich was reasonable sized nothing extraordinary but by itself not enough to satisfy. My waitress told me no did you want fries? well yes I said and questioned if they came with the sandwich, No was the reply.

At 6.79 for a sandwich that did not include the fries at this mediocre establishment I thought a little expensive.

The sandwich was oak nothing to write home about although not too bad but not value for my money. Perhaps I am spoiled by the choices and prices in Columbus. either way can only give 2 stars for my experience."}
{"text":"I went to the Eat'n Park in Robinson last Saturday.  Overall it was a good experience.  When I arrived, I had a short wait at the host stand while the hostess seated someone who arrived just before I did.  They sat me at a table where some guests had just left.  They cleared and cleaned the table quickly, and I sat down.  Shortly after, the server took my order.  I ordered the Original Superburger Deal.  After a short wait, my food came, although I was missing the lemonade that I ordered.  The waitress stopped by rather promptly and, without my asking, informed me that she would be right back with my lemonade.  The Superburger is based off the Big Boy (Eat'n Park used to be affiliated with Frisch's Big Boy).  It is similar to a Big Mac, only the quality is 100 times better, it has two pickle chips on top, and instead of \"Special Sauce\" it has \"Sauce Supreme,\" which is a little bit different.  The fries were delicious, and the lemonade was good.  For dessert, I ordered the pie of the month, which was a Pumpkin Creme Pie.  It was delicious.  It tasted like it sounds, a cross between pumpkin pie and a creme pie.  It was definitely more creamy than pumpkiny.  I then went to pay my tab at the cashier, and I picked up a box of Pittsburgh Pirates Smiley Cookies, as well.  Smiley cookies taste like typical box frosted sugar cookies, but they are just part of the Eat'n Park experience.  It is always a joy to have one, especially the special edition ones.  Just like the hostess and the waitress, the cashier was very friendly.
Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Eat'n Park in Robinson.  The guest service was excellent and I was pleased with both the price and how quickly they got me in and out.  I would definitely consider dining here again the next time I am in Robinson, or at any other Eat'n Park that I'm near."}
{"text":"Every third Thursday of the month Eden Park Hostess a breakfast in bingo are waitresses always same as she is awesome everybody is very friendly and it becomes a very fun and eventful environment we have breakfast around 8:30 and then we play Bingo around 10 until 11:30 it's a very fun thing to do and very consistent every third Thursday of the month"}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit. I love the western omelette with potato pancakes and wheat toast. The service is always friendly and the price is right."}
{"text":"This location has had a total overall and it looks fabulous. The food here has always been good in my experience, and I definitely love the new updates. It's like a brand new restaurant. Eat'n'Park's Belgian waffle smile is one of the best deals anywhere on planet earth, and their Belgian waffle is certainly in the top three best waffles I've ever had. It's just that good.

Especially during strawberry pie season, another one of their absolutely delicious options, ask for strawberries on your waffle.  The salad bar is always a good option, there's lots of stuff up there to choose from-it's also available as an option to add to any meal as a side.  My go to's for hot entrées are the whale of a cod dinner with french fries and a salad bar or the new crispy chicken club sandwich with salad bar as a side.

THE BAKERY: Eat'n'Park baked goods are nothing to shake a stick at. The peach berry pie, actually any of their pies are delicious. But especially the peach berry. The rye bread is made in house at each location, as are all of the sweet rolls that you can get with your dinner entrées. 

Grilled stickies- FORGET about it one of gods greatest creations and totally addicting."}
{"text":"People are crazy with these bad reviews! Eat'n'Park is a Pittsburgh staple and a BREAKFAST/LUNCH spot. Don't come to eat'n'park expecting a fine dining experience: it's a beefed up diner. 

The pies and breads are fantastic. They bake a lot of things in house. The breakfasts are delicious and their smiley Belgian waffle is the best waffle money can buy. The service is good at this location and it's open super late on weekends if that's your thing. 

The salad bar is always fresh, the soups hot, and the sandwiches on the menu are good. Super clean and well maintained and a great location for a big crowd of people regardless of what time of day."}
{"text":"Eat'n Park is a step up from your typical diner, with an always-fresh and local when possible salad bar, hot soups, and desserts, as well as a rather extensive menu with great seasonal specials. What sets Eat'n Park aside from many diner-type places is its Celiac-friendly/Gluten-Free menu. They offer gluten free buns (which require thawing, so ask them to toast it), and plenty of naturally GF menu items. Dining here is a joy for me because I know I won't get sick! This location is also a GREEN building! Very cool, ENP."}
{"text":"I am not a huge Eat'n Park fan. It's nice because there is something for everyone. I have never had a great experience. BUT !!! I was so pleasantly surprised this morning. 

The service was great ! Accommodating to a grandma and granddaughter!! I was so hungry for an omelette. 

The new Sausage & Pepper Omelette was amazingly good ! I asked for sauce on the side so I could dip ! I am a dipper 

My daughter enjoyed her Western and granddaughter loved the French Toast ! 

We will definitely return again when hungry for an omelette!!

We used the coupon for the free slice of Strawberry Pie - !!  Great dessert !!"}
{"text":"When I came here in high school, I thought it was great. They've upped the prices and their food can come out flat-out shady. One thing that was generally worth the money here was the breakfast buffet. But lately, it is not well stocked at all. The food gets cold, even with lids on every item. The last time I went, I ordered the breakfast buffet. No eggs, no bacon up there. I decided to get a few other little things while I waited for them to restock. I went back 20 minutes later, still no eggs or bacon. At that point, people were waiting for it to come out. On a Sunday, I know it's busy, but when so many people order the buffet, it should be a priority to keep it stocked well."}
{"text":"My mother and father started going here in 1952.  This was when they brought your food to your car and you ate in your car. It wasn't this exact location but it was eat n park. They both think the Cod is their favorite dish fixed any way. My mother loves the poached eggs.  The coffee is excellent. They do not like the strawberry pie. It has  gelee on it and crust is terrible. It's a great place for them to go when  you don't know what  to eat. It's great for retired people who are on a budget.  Prices have gone up and they don't go as much but they understand it happens. They often split a dinner and its handled nicely and they never feel awkward."}
{"text":"Park n Eat then go into the restaurant. That's how I like to do it.

Eat n Park is probably one of the worst diner chains you may ever have the misfortune of visiting. Their food may even be worse than Denny's. If that is possible. The service here is nice but I always seem to get food poisoning from this chain, and it only seems to be teenage girls or old people that ever want to take me to one. Next time it is suggested, I will insist on choosing somewhere else."}
{"text":"I come to eat n park for a fairly cheap meal on random occasions. They have decent service and I appreciate the staff for their friendliness.

I give them a 3 because they are not spectacular but they have their own niche style that I enjoy. Very low key and a chill place to eat. I don't want anything more because than they would prob charge more. 

I would stick to the breakfast menu here at eat n park."}
{"text":"They seat very fast even though there was a wait at the door. The service was very efficient. Although, the food was delicious, it seemed as if they didn't bring it out right away.  While enjoying my Philly cheesesteak, I was supplied with a surplus of water which is great to keep you hydrated while chowing down. Our waitress was on top of everything except we were eating around old dishes which can be a problem when you are trying to enjoy your meal. This is your ideal late night place to grab a bite to eat for cheap."}
{"text":"I go to this Eat N' Park because it is near Minda's house. Yesterday, Mom, Rica, and I went here. Mom and I both got baked sole with potato and a vegetable. Rica got chicken with pasta and cheese. It came with the salad bar. For desert we got split lava cake. Everything was real good. A woman at the adjacent booth said \"getting your masters at the same place you did your undergrad is a faux pas\". She may not know what \"faux pas\" means, exactly. Mom told the manager that she was there with her kids and he gave us cookies."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I do not want American cheese on my omelet. Your menu says your choice of cheese. The manager came out to argue with me about their poor service, I wasn't offered a refund. I had to wait forever. It had a slab of American cheese on it. I don't want my omelet tasting like a cheeseburger. 

I think the only reason this place gets any business is because of the location."}
{"text":"Best menu in Pittsburgh. No one compares. Plus the smiling cookie is adorable. Great for kids, moderate noise and great for groups. Eat n park is really the only way to go if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This is the worst Eat'n Park in the area. The service is terrible. I waited for over 45 minutes after we ordered to receive our food. Terrible service overall"}
{"text":"Eat n Park has been a staple in my life for many years. I hit up E n P for Friday lunch with my coworker around 12:30pm. It was busy, but we got seated right away. 

Heads up - they completely rebuilt this E n P about 2 years ago - it's so nice! They just released their new menus! So new menu items, but I ordered my old favorites. 

I started out with a bowl of the chicken noodle. Or is seriously the best chicken noodle I've ever had. 

For my meal, I ordered the chicken fillets entree with a side salad and side of apple sauce. They are some of my favorite comfort foods. Eat n Park's ranch dressing is out of this world! 

Our waitress Irene seemed to be kinda grumpy when we first ordered- but by the end of our meal. She sweetened up. 

Overall, I love Eat n Park - the Avalon location I believe is now the first or second oldest locations around. It's true a great place for the whole family."}
{"text":"We have eaten at several Eat'n Parks before, so were really surprised at how bad this one was. Salad bar was awful, chicken and broccoli alfredo was ok, but very bland, garlic bread used some kind of cheap artificial \"butter\" and was tasteless. The drinks had so much chlorine in them from the water that they tasted terrible. We even tried two different kinds of iced tea and a Mountain Dew. All tasted like chlorine.

Please, at least get a simple charcoal filter to get that chlorine out of the water!!

Our waitress Kantinna was very very good!!"}
{"text":"Dirty. Poor service. Now I remember why I haven't been back there in a LONG time.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Always good food at a fair price. It's not gourmet, but they have an amazing salad/ soup bar that would put most other places to shame. Great fresh food, friendly service, and desserts to go. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"The eat n park on McKnight Road is the worst place to eat if you enjoy good food and good hospitality. They are more concerned with what time they will be leaving that night, than they are with your satisfaction. In particular DONNA AKA DONNA TRUMP was rude and prejudice  towards me and my friends. We had just come from a high school dance and she treated us like kindergartens. We are all 18 have money and are paying for our food, and she treated us like we were criminals. She thought that we weren't going to pay for our bill and treated us like caged animals. We LOVE their waiter TANNER he was so nice and we gave him a great tip. He is the man. He was the only good thing about this experience. Also, there was hair in one of our plates .... looked like Donnas."}
{"text":"Our favorite Eat'n Park location! It's the most kid friendly and has speedy service. The food is always fresh and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, like all the Eat'n Park locations and the service was surprisingly good for our large party."}
{"text":"Took my mom out for birthday brunch and it was wonderful. Our server was Kathy who was very sweet and patient and gave exceptional service even though they were packed with people! Delicious meals. A little on the pricey side for 2 salad bars and a breakfast meal, but nonetheless a very good experience."}
{"text":"Bridget is the best server ever. Omg. She takes care of our table better than my gram would have. She deserves everything in the world. Love you Grandma."}
{"text":"Good, quality breakfast/brunch selection and an attentive and friendly wait staff. The menu goes beyond the standard diner.  Nearby Frick Park is an excellent place to walk or jog away the calories."}
{"text":"Well last nights dinner was a disappointment.  Fist I will say our waitress... Stephanie was a gem!  Personality plus! ... and that's about it ... we both got the salad bar.  ... kinda messy... no... let me re think that .... a LOT messy ....soup station was missing spoons and soup bowls ... bathrooms were unbelievably messy.   A real turn off.  I realize this place is open 24 hour ... the bus boys were hustling.. but this place needs Cleaned.  So Eat n Park managers... get your act together.  Do not blame the over worked hourly workers ... when you see something amiss roll up your damn sleeves and pitch in.   



UPDATE!!!!!!

Well apparently my original post got some attention at the main office.  I appreciate and thank you for addressing the problems.  Eat n Park has always been a favorite for us and we hope to continue going ."}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite late night hot spot. And tonight the waitress was a real gem, a dime a dozen. My fruit cup was sadly so bad, easily the worst melon/honeydew I've ever had. But thank goodness, the waitress brought out some extra banana slices. Good night, bad melon. That's all . will come again. Will not order fruit at night though."}
{"text":"Seems ok, until you order, the food is average at best, nothing special, kinda like a bad Dennys, service is ok, then again not memorable, prices are fair for the food, wouldn't recommend, reckon if your drunk this food is better. Guess the chef who creates these dishes eats dog food, thinks it's great."}
{"text":"Decent place to get coffee at odd hours. Where else can you go when the fire alarm goes off at 4 in the morning and you need to evacuate the apartment complex (again!)!

This particular Eat N Park is clean, friendly, and I've always had a good quality meal, salad, pancakes, or whatever I'm getting. Is it the best meal ever? No, but it'll do in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Eat N Park is not my favorite local chain.  The food and service is constantly hit or miss across the chain.  This Eat N Park, however, is one of the few non-smoking, late-night options in Squirrel Hill, which takes it up a notch.

I usually order the American Scrambler, which is just a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich with a fruit cup and potatoes.  It is reasonably priced and enough food to fill me.  Stick to simple things when you order here for the best results.

The service is usually friendly, and I like the remodel a lot.  It's not always fast, but it is the best late night option for me!"}
{"text":"God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids"}
{"text":"Literally writing this because I can't stop craving their milkshakes... It's kind of becoming a diet. But seriously Eat'n Park is my jam. I'm all about any place that serves veggie burgers and Mac n cheese bites 247. Staff is always friendly and I don't care what anyone says I love a smiley cookie!"}
{"text":"My experience here was not good my family and I were seated all the way in the back of the Resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. We were the ONLY African Americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that, the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor 
I wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving"}
{"text":"I couldn't resist trying this ENP after it was rebuilt.  Maybe it's just that I haven't been to an ENP in a long time (probably the better part of a decade), but I was just disappointed.  The service was truly slow (like 10 minutes to get water?).  The salad bar seemed to have half the selection I remember it having.  (No cottage cheese?)  On the upside, the ranch is as tasty as I remember and that was the real reason we went any how.  Then, my order was wrong (I ordered fried pickles... got a burger instead?).  Our server was beyond apologetic and it was fixed in less than five minutes, but hard to understand in the first place...  Interesting to note, we learned that ENP and Sheetz have the same food supplier.  My DH ordered jalapeno poppers and noticed they were virtually identical to the ones he LOVES at Sheetz.  Quick google search later... Yep, same ones.  

All in all, a cheap, quick Friday night dinner (even with the delays on ordering, we were still in and out in less than 45 minutes)."}
{"text":"We had a really nice Sunday brunch here today. It exceeded my expectations which were admittedly very low. We needed some healthy food options for our 1.5 year old as well as enough comfort food to satisfy our starving and lazy weekend bellies. 

There was a short 10 minute wait for a table at around noon but the hostess was nice enough and they gave us a big, clean booth with a partial view of the river. It took another 10-15 minutes to get service although our waiter did pop by to say he would be right with us. Another waitress took our order in the end and they comped us for one buffet. So the three of us ate for the price of one since kids five and under get a free buffet with a paying adult. ($7.99)

Ok enough about the service which was slowish but it's a full house at that time so understandable . The food:

The buffet was constantly refreshed and each container overflowing with hot food. My favorites: really well cooked fried chicken perfectly salted and complemented with Frank's red hot sauce. Biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were a little dry, mini peirogies, cooked baby carrots, really nice mini pancakes, stuffing, bacon, and ok-only home fries. It's too bad cos I generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it. My husband had some decent salad and good clam chowda.

My kid ate everything on the other end of the buffet: cherry tomatoes, cottage cheese, cooked baby carrots, cantaloupe and honeydew melon, pineapple, bits of peirogie and chicken. The waiter gave him a shamrock sugar cookie at the end of the meal. We helped him eat most of it :)

There were a few misses: French toast were disappointingly dry and hard and the buttery/oniony noodles were undercooked. Other things looked good but we couldn't try it all: mini-waffles, mash potatoes and gravy, sausage patties, cheesey sauce, scrambled eggs. We'll just have to go again in a few weekends. Alright folks, don't need to run out and crowd it up but that fried chicken... Mmm mmm."}
{"text":"After a quick glance at some of the highlighted reviews it seems like people tend to come here at odd hours.

I came today at lunch time and the service was good. Our server was friendly and attentive. I had a few special request for my meal, and the server was very accommodating and precise. My water was always at least half full, and the food was tasty.

I ordered off of the all day breakfast menu and everything was tasty! I love the waffles at 
EatN' Park, there food is pretty consistent. 

This is always one of the best spots to stretch your dollar and fill your belly. I have had a couple bad experiences at EatN' Park's across the Burgh, but the Squirrel Hill location is always good.  

I highly recommend visiting this location if you are looking for a inexpensive meal!"}
{"text":"Ok so i am originally from Cali but lived in PA for 3 years. I love the pot roast sandwich and always getting the fries too! Have a smile cookie on your way out, its kind of the signature here. Way better then Denny's haha"}
{"text":"Returned to this Eat N' Park some two decades later. Had the soup and salad bar. I seem to recall the salad bar was a lot better back then. What happened?"}
{"text":"Shouldn't the name actually be park 'n eat?
Maybe not, real choke and puck joint"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and only once it was when other nearby places were open - my first time. All other times, I've come here during odd hours - after 2am or before 7am. The only reason I come here is because it's really close to my home and is the only place open late. (I think they recently moved away from being open 24 hours and shut down 3am-6am). 

It's not the best eatery around. Their fish sandwich is pretty unsavory, so I wouldn't recommend that. Somehow, they've managed to mess up the molten Lava cake as well. Their breakfast items are decent - the banana french toast is the only item that I somewhat like. I would also avoid the key lime pie. 

The servers are nice. Ambience is like a regular diner."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here, I regret it. A line of people were waited to be seated and it took about 5 minutes for the greeter to come back from seating the people ahead of us. The man in front of my group had to ask a girl on her break to get someone to do their job. After being seated, service was incredibly slow. The table behind ours was never served so they went to the salad bar, got full salads, and left them untouched. We saw our waitress twice while we were there (she was nice but still). Hire people with customer service skills and not so many high schoolers."}
{"text":"There's always something with this location. Nearly Every time we visit we have an inattentive waitress or the food comes out weird. The thing that irks me the most is the man on salad bar using old gloves. I wrote corporate and they apologized with a $15 gift card, which I didn't expect. So, that was kind of them. In general I enjoy ENP but this location needs improvement

I recently purchased banana foster. 3 slices; extra bananas and foster sauce. Totally worth $9. Take out waitress was on point 

I purchase bananas foster for the third time via take out. I think I Should play it safe and keep doing take out instead of dining in. Love the banana foster !!"}
{"text":"I'm a 'New York Girl', born & bred - but my mom was from Pittsburgh so my brothers & I grew up spending Summers in PA - first in N. Braddock - later ('55 and on) in Monroeville - a special part of Summer was eating at Eat'n'Park ... I spent this past weekend in Monroeville for a family event - and I am happy to say that I found Eat'n'Park to be every bit as good as I remembered! DIFFERENT - but in a good way - the variety is greater, the people are as friendly (maybe more so!) and the quality is as good or better ... and the value can't be beat! The quality of the total experience is incredible - while Eat'n'Park is not 'fine dining' it is FUN dining and a FINE value! While EVERYONE we encountered was personable and friendly - a special 'shout out' to Amy - for making us feel we were truly welcome!"}
{"text":"I have enough reviews about EnP that you guys know we usually have hit or miss food &/or service after trying multiple locations.. so much that my fiance refuses any EnP anymore. 

I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this location. I've been here atleast 5 times in the last 3 years. Anywayssss, my sister and I stopped in yesterday for dinner. I was craving something specific from another spot, but i knew my picky sister wouldn't find too many things at that place appetizing.. so i decided on EnP. 

Our server was Ali (I believe) and she was so sweet! Seriously i could say that 10 times! 

Our food however was mediocre. I ordered the herb crusted chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy and a salad. My sister ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with a salad. We ordered mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini for apps. Our appetizers were so beyond greasy. I totally get that they are fried foods, but i mean these were drenched it grease. The zucchini breading fell off bc of how wet it was, ugh. My sister's buffalo chicken wrap didnt have buffalo sauce in it (?!!?!?!?!) The roll my dinner was served with was old and hard. I'm not one to complain in reviews but these were silly kitchen mistakes that shouldn't have happened. 

I'll stick to 3 stars just because the service was great and i know i'll be back at some point, even though I know Bobby most likely will not join, lol."}
{"text":"Gosh enp is so average. Now I know why bobby sticks his nose up to it.

 Surprisingly he suggested enp after doing some Christmas shopping at waterworks. We both ordered the salad bar meal deals... A few entree options that come with a side plus salad bar. Price ranged from 10-11.50 which is not bad for the amount of food.

 Bobby orderer the Romano chicken, mashed potatoes and a expresso. I ordered rosemary chicken with mashed potatoes gravy and an iced tea. The first ice tea came out to be tropical. She took it back and brought back a \"fresh brewed \" one.. It was very dark bitter and cloudy.. It wasn't ready. I ate my food with no drink. 

Bobby's Romano chicken looked like a Romano chicken you'd get from EnP. My rosemary chicken was flavorful kinda, but I was expecting more.. I mean rosemary is very flavorful. Both pieces of chicken were TINY! IM talking like 5 year olds dinner plate. 

Finally my drink came normal after my meal...... Oh and the rolls (AFTER we were done eating) she brought a box for rolls and the check with iced tea still on it. We asked for it to be taken off.. I didn't even enjoy it til I was done eating and by that time I took 3 sips before leaving. 

Nice server but she was new and inexperienced. 

Idk I'm sick of spending $$ on below average meals. this is why we've slowed down on eating out . I bet I can make a better rosemary chicken and iced tea."}
{"text":"So, when i checked into this location, I noticed it averaged at 2 stars. I was surprised because this restaurant is in a nicer area so I figured it would have a better rating. We dont really head to EnP too much.. we've had the crappiest experience at Sq. Hill & Waterfront.. even after second chances so Bobby refuses to even come anymore.

I stopped here yesterday for some to-go breakfast. I got a second job at Bobbys store at the mall since he is understaffed.I stopped here for a quick breakfast before heading to work

 I went to the hostess stand and explained I'm placing a to-go order and she pointed where I should stand and said the to-go worker will be out shortly. I literally stood there for ten minutes just waiting on her to come out! 

Anyways, afterwards I ordered some breakfast combo (cant remember the official name) It came with one egg, choice of meat, toast and home fries. I also asked for grilled stickies a la mode and a coffee. 

Ok, first things first, the coffee was disgusting! You ever have a pot of coffee that is low and sits on the burner for awhile so it taste, well, burnt.... thats exactly what this tasted like. I'm not sure if they use different coffee from the dining in and take out but my coffee was not fresh! I waited 15 minutes for food-- which is fine because I didn't call ahead. When the girl brought it out, she asked if i wanted ice cream with my stickies.. I asked for a la mode when ordering but whatever. Finally, I get to work and it's so busy I have no time to eat. I go to eat my food 20 minutes later only to find out that no home fries were in my box! I ordered that breakfast specifically for the homefries and paid for them, but didnt receive them! They also did not put silverware in my to-go bag. (????!!!???!!??!)

I dont even think I can come back as a dine in option. The only good thing I experienced was the cashier for the people who were paying that dined in. She was really nice and friendly. I felt like the girl who took my order was new or inexperienced. She totally messed up my order and disappeared for 10 minutes while people were waiting in the take out line. Another bad experience at EnP! I'm from Beaver County which has 2 EnP locations... I never had any complaints for those. I don't know why Pgh ones just suuuuuck!"}
{"text":"We probably eat here once a week. Consistent quality and service. The longest we've ever had to wait was 10 minutes and that was on a weekend with a large group."}
{"text":"Great staff, good to fair food. I have patronized several locations for this franchise over the years, but this particular location is my favorite. While the food is pretty much the same at any one of them, the service here is top notch. It's diner food with a few twists, and the salad bar offerings are diverse, and always fresh. I always tip double what I do other rplaces, because they deserve the extra. Best menu item? Whale of a cod sandwich!"}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast on 5/6/18 for pick up at the window. Our order number was 9146. The only reason we ordered from here again was because we had a $10 gift card due to a previous complaint about the food. In the order, we asked to make sure the breakfast potatoes aren't burnt because we have had that problem in the past. Yesterday was the absolute last time we will ever order from here. Attached is the photo of the food we received in our order. Black burnt potatoes, stale toast, overcooked eggs, and dried out sausage. It's hard to believe they would actually serve breakfast looking like this to someone in the restaurant, so why send it in a takeout order? This was by far the worst breakfast we have had. It's a shame the employees here this this looks acceptable or edible"}
{"text":"I thought this is a nice place to eat if you have a family. Lot of options, food was pretty good and cheap. Was satisfied with my meal, had fish with veggies(Years ago) and did tell others that this was a nice option.

Its not super gourmet, but it is a place you can grab a nice meal at a good price."}
{"text":"When you go to an Eat 'N Park, you definitely do not get anything fancy. But I wanted just breakfast--bacon, eggs, toast, and tea. The waitress was nice and checked in with us periodically to see if we needed anything. The food tasted good. I did notice that the square and smiley-faced windows in the building might go out of architectural style soon, but they are interesting and cute to look at. On the way out, I waited in line to purchase smiley cookies. The line had only one person in front of me, but I waited for several minutes--too much time! Eventually I got my cookies, and I was out the door."}
{"text":"I eat out for business ususally around 4 days a week, and at least once a week with the family. If I ever try and go to Eat N Park again with a laptop, please kill me!   

After waiting for 30 minutes for a table that had a plug (mind you, they were not busy!) I was sat at one of 3 tables with a plug.  As soon as I pulled the computer out, I could sense a collective groan from the staff.  I typically do not try and do work at Eat N Park for this reason.   There seems to be a culture that deemphasizes business services.  

The food is at best adequate, and the atmosphere is, well, it's an Eat N Park.  One bright spot is the wait staff. They are friendly and accomodating, but given the limited resources they are provided by the Corporate moles, it does not make up for the shortsightedness towards the services a business traveler requires.  

The coffee cups are tiny, the food comes luke warm, and little value is given to attention to details in the food preparation.  

It is obvious that the target demographic is not the business traveler.  In looking around the restaurant, I would say that 90% of the patrons are over 60. 

If you like crappy food served with a smile, Eat N Park should work fine.  If you are a business traveler and expect a bit more, avoid all Eat N Parks like an Amway sales person.   For a truely accomodating meal for a business person, try Panera or Bob Evans.  They both offer WIFI and have far more ACcessible tables for the laptop carrier.  

Until Eat N Park is more accomodating to the business traveler,  I'll be eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the E'n P in awhile, but I used to come here about once a month with a Meetup group on Sun. evenings for dinner.  I've been here both before and after the remodel, and I agree with other reviewers that, though the place looks snazzier, the food hasn't improved.  Service has always been friendly, if slow.

If you're looking for basic diner fare or late night munchies, the E'n P fits the bill well.  Having said that, you can tell that most of the food here is frozen or straight out of a container.  I've never ordered any of the breakfast specials, which seem to be quite popular, but I have ordered sandwiches and entrees, and they've all been pretty salty and flavorless, akin to cafeteria food.  The salad bar is usually a pretty safe bet, and the one thing they seem to get right is the potato soup, which comes with it.  Thinking that diner desserts are usually good even if the food isn't that great, I once tried a slice of strawberry cream pie once at the Waterfront location, but unfortunately, it failed to impress me, being of similar quality to the food.

E'n P is a great place to come with kids, older relatives, large groups that include picky eaters, and drunk people.  Other than that, you'd do well to pass it up and explore the plethora of better and more interesting dining options in the neighborhood. 2.5 stars, only because I think the smiley cookies are cute."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Eat'n Park, but lately both the quality of service and food has decreased as the prices increase. The last 3 times I have gone to the new Bethel Park location, I have been extremely disappointed. The food and beverages tasted like dishwater and or was very bland with no flavor. All three times the vegetables were soggy and mushy. The first time I went, I ordered a turkey burger and ended up sick for a day and a half afterword. The second time I ordered the fish and it tasted as if it had been thrown in the microwave for too long and had a rubbery texture. Finally yesterday I ordered a simple chicken salad and the chicken was mushy like the vegetables and had a horrible flavor. Before the new place opened, the service and food were enjoyable. I'm not sure what happened between then and the reopening, but it's horrible. Needless to say I will not be wasting my time or money going to this location again, and it will probably be a while before I give another Eat'n Park a chance. Last weekend I went to Deny's where the food was both flavorful and affordable, the way Eat'n Parks food used to be. I think I will stick to that restaurant for a while."}
{"text":"I had eggs Benedict my wife had eggs and kielbasa. There was about 1 tablespoon of hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict and of course the eggs were overcooked. The frozen hashbrowns were still like cold and raw in the middle.  Overall not a place I would return."}
{"text":"No matter the time of day, you can't go wrong with Eat N Park.  Great options for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night.  The salad bar is constantly replenished and always has three soup choices.  Service is fast and friendly.  One of my favorite places for comfort food."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a \"chain\" but you basically can't go wrong with a meal at Eat N Park.  You won't get gourmet food and wonderfully plated items, but the food is tasty.

This was my first visit to this location.  I was waiting at the host stand for a few minutes with several staff fluttering around and finally had to ask if someone was going to seat me.  When they finally did, we had somewhat decent service.  Our server was attentive and friendly, but it seemed to take a great deal of time between asking for something and actually receiving it.  

They have a new special for several of their entrees - $9.99 including the salad bar and one side.  Most of their dinners are under $10 and portion sizes are decent.  I had the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy and delicious!  The only down side is that the chicken pieces were very large, long strips.  I wish the pieces were cut up more, but that is not something I couldn't remedy on my own.  The salad bar was constantly restocked and fresh and everything i tried was tasty.  

Don't leave Eat N Park without trying a Smiley Cookie!  Right now they have jack o lantern smiley.  They are tasty and, well, can't help but make you smile."}
{"text":"Great waitstaff, very friendly and obliging.  They were missing an ingredient for some of the food I ordered so I had to change my order.  The food I did get was disappointing.

Bills itself as family dining and I suppose it's good for that.

The location at the waterfront is nice, especially if you sit outside."}
{"text":"Newly renovated the restaurant has a diner feel with an updated touch. The menu hasn't changed but the quality is even better. Opt for the salad bar or one of many items on their menu and you won't be disappointed! Don't leave until you have a slice of their homemade pies or shakes, they'll leave you dying for more!"}
{"text":"I personally don't really understand why so many people like to hate on this place so much. Sure the food isn't the best quality, but in my opinion American diner food is not usually worth raving about to begin with. Add this to the fact that most such places serve you oversized portions with higher prices than ENP, and I find ENP to be a much more solid choice, especially in a city where everything is closed by 10pm.

That said, ENP is a good (read: ONLY) place to go when it's late at night and you're starving at home with no food in your fridge. They have a midnight menu which is pretty extensive, including comfort food appetizers, brunch omelettes and toast, burgers, salads, and a few dinner items. Mostly quite decent. I especially like the fact that portions are not plus-sized, with prices scaled proportionally. In addition, you have a choice of sides for most things.

Service is okay. For late night when there are fewer people, the servers are usually more attentive. Wait times for food can vary, which is a mystery as it was never crowded when we came here.

Have never tried their famous smiley cookies, but I have tried their pies and I can say that they're delightful."}
{"text":"I came here today (02/12/16) for brunch with my aunt and uncle. Caitlyn was our hostess and Stephanie was our waitress. They're both absolute dolls.

I had the Sunday brunch buffet (which goes from 11-2) and raspberry iced tea; my aunt had a superburger, cole slaw, and decaf coffee; my uncle ate a bacon omelette with home fries (burnt). Everything was perfect, except for my uncle's home fries not being well done enough for his taste.

I've been here dozens of times over the years, and I really think this is the best ENP location out of all of them.

Review #190."}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon with my father. I had the Bananas Foster French Toast and he had the All-American Scrambler. Everything was really good but the food wasn't hot enough. Service was so-so; our waitress did her job but wasn't warm as you would expect an ENP waitress to be.

(To be honest, though, I had come here less than two hours after putting my dog down so I was miserable to begin with.)

Review #160."}
{"text":"Eat 'n' Park is one of the great things about the Pittsburgh area.  Never have I seen a chain diner where the food is so consistently good.  Eat 'n' Park blows Denny's and King's out of the water in terms of quality.

Now, that doesn't mean that it's the best food ever! It's still diner food, and some of it is still going to feel cheapish.  BUT their shredded pot roast is excellent, their steak and cheese isn't very Philly, but is very tasty, and I rarely have a bad server here.

If you want some eats and a bottomless cup of coffee, seek out an Eat 'n' Park!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, good service.    Quick and fun times."}
{"text":"poor quality of food for the money; over priced, more of a college hangout than good food"}
{"text":"Good cheap food. Horrible service.  Had to wait 15 minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us.  He then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks. Our appetizers came out before our drinks. Didn't get any refills."}
{"text":"Always my go-to restaurant for some good breakfast or a quick snack. Eat'N Park isn't something new to most people but the one in Franklin Park always has a friendly environment. It's very open with the buffet right in the middle. It also has an eat-in bar with a television if you're just coming by yourself for a quick meal. 

The one thing I love about Eat'N Park is that it always has an ever-changing breakfast menu with some great choices. I just tried their South of the Border Stack and it's to die for if you're into food with a kick."}
{"text":"I am VERY impressed with the new \"drive thru\" here at Eat N Park. I ordered a Whale of a fish sandwich from the car on the way home tonight.
Not only was it ready by the time I got there , it was still piping hot and they even gave me a free cookie!
The girl at the window was very energetic and friendly. Excellent Customer service.
I love the Pittsburgh Fish tradition at all of the local churches , and I can hardly wait to them to begin the Lent specials. BUT I have to now include this Eat n park to my Friday fish stop. Thank you again to a local Pittsburgh company."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront. From the second I walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes, which I thought was weird because they were not busy. The manager, who was standing close and talking to another employee looked briefly at us, didn't smile or welcome us, turned and continued her conversation. We finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table. We sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before I finally decided enough was enough and left. My sister loves Eat n Park but every time I enter the waterfront store I'm severely disappointed. 
 
I've been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in Oakland for over six years so I know what I'm talking about. I have never let anyone stand in a doorway like that, I would wait on you myself until the waitress could get to you. It is appalling to see what that place has become. I will never go back to that place again."}
{"text":"One star for good service. My girlfriend and I got day old food. When you can get edible food from fast food, what's the point of eat n park. I could actually taste the cooks hatred of life, and his job."}
{"text":"The food and service were phenomenal with great prices. Our waitress was friendly and made sure that everything was good."}
{"text":"I love this eatnpark! We come here all the time because of the friendly staff and fresh tasting food. I actually live closer to the west liberty location but we will drive a little further because this one is way better, we haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Eat n Park is a great Pittsburgh American classic restaurant. I have been eating here since I was a kid (seems like many moons ago). Stopped in to grab a Superburger, Fries, and Slaw (which is normally what I always get). Great staff and quick service.  I highly recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Really like this location.  Very clean, good service, friendly staff, and great Eat n Park food.  Nothing starts a day better than a Breakfast Smile."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants. But let's first all agree that there is Five Guys, there is BurgerKing, then there is McDonald. 

I have no idea how I have been here three times already.  Dont remember much about the food.  The only thing I remember is that I regret it every single time.  Especially in the Squirrel Hill area, there are so many better options nearby.  Don't do it... just don't.

ps.  Going through other ppls review, now i remember a bit more...  chili soup was too salty. It appears that breakfast and lunch are better than dinner.  All my visits were dinners, so maybe one last time and try their breakfast?"}
{"text":"Our tour group of 12 from Cincinnati ate here, never having heard of it before, but it was like Frisch's / Big Boy.  The tour guide had called ahead to warn of our arrival, but it took forever to get anyone to come and seat the people waiting in front of us, or us.  They seemed really short staffed!  

Our waitress Marie did a good job considering she appeared to be serving ALL of the tables in the place!  Our food was OK, and I was glad that I tried the low fat cod baked in orange juice."}
{"text":"Fresh produce and ingredient game has come a long way. For a chain that offers consistency at an affordable price and a family friendly atmosphere, they hit the mark. And as far as service, these people HUSTLE! It'd be interesting to find out the numbers of tables and meals they turn over on a weekend shift!! Don't be fooled by the simplified menu, all kinds of options are available, they're happy to personalize your selections they cater to allergen/ dietary specifications.... Also a great late night spot! Some time just go to squirrel hill late night and watch ! Ha"}
{"text":"So I know this is an Eat N Park but we just stopped here for breakfast. Ordered two original breakfast smiles they were cooked to our preference and tasty as expected. No issues with the food but the service was horrible!!! 
We were pressed for time so when we got our food we asked for our check and then the waitress disappeared we didn't see her when we were eating and waited 10 minutes after we finished when we finally saw her and then asked for our check again. She brought us the wrong check and then we were told we would have to wait and she would have to cash us out By this point we were irritated and waited long enough left money then left.
It really takes me a lot to get annoyed at a restaurant but it was ridiculous how long we waited and asked ahead of time to make sure we didn't have to wait. We ended up being late to the place we needed to go"}
{"text":"Eat'n Park is truly the place for smiles! Nothing beats coming out of a late night movie and walking over to this inexpensive Pittsburgh treat. 
I love the Superburger and everything is stand for. Seriously, it is like an explosion of amazing in my mouth! 
The remodel looks great too!"}
{"text":"They still have a good atmosphere for kids, but the food is lacking on our last couple visits. Specifically, the salad/soup bar is inconsistent and sometimes the soup is too salty to eat.  Too much stuff out of season and dressings with no flavor make a lousy plate."}
{"text":"I love eat 'n park. Whenever I come to Pittsburgh, I go to this restaurant. This area is great in the waterfront. It's so peaceful here. Pittsburgh is a beautiful city. Eat n Park has the best pie. I wish we have this at home. Their banana cream pie and their strawberry pie are my family's favorite. Their food is better than IHOP. They are so cheap. You can get a slice of pie for $3.  They have a variety of everything and they are clean. Their cheese fries, milk shakes, and their breakfast menu are great. Not everything is great on the menu but they have everything you can think of in a diner and the best part is they are open 24 hrs a day. If you're hungry in the middle of the night, they have a midnight menu. I like this location better than the one at squirrel hill. The waitresses are nicer and the food is better. We stop here every time we are in town. They are not a fancy place but they have good cheap food. Try the food, you can't go wrong with the money you're paying."}
{"text":"The service at this Eat n Park kind of sucks, but the food's the same quality of course. It's a really nice-looking and roomy Eat n Park, though."}
{"text":"It really bothers me when management asks to be contacted after you write a review. At least 5 employees walked past the gentleman standing at the soup waiting for cups, until finally the last one asked if she could help him. He even stuck his head in the kitchen entry and was ignored. My recent comments and other reviewers' comments point to a management issue that has flourished here for years.  Don't ask reviewers to contact you with further information. Correct the well-known issues--it's a management and staff issue, not a Yelp reviewer issue."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the breakfast buffet. 


I was very unimpressed by this buffet, and this is coming from a former employee, so I already know what to expect. The food here was not very hot, and they seemed to always be running out. The first time I went up there were no biscuits or any kind of bread. (There was supposed to be, but they were out) My server was very nice and brought some for me, but by the time my boyfriend went back up to the buffet the sausage gravy was empty. No one refilled it. There were several spots on the buffet that were empty on both of my trips up, and the potatoes that they offered were slightly burnt yet cold at the same time. 

Service was good but if you're going to pay over $11 for buffet/coffee it ought to at least be hot. Like I said, I knew what I was getting into coming in to this buffet, and still it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Eat n Park (Penn Hills) for years and they never disappoint. I did a take out order on Halloween 2015. The lady that took my phone order was very polite and professional, she repeated my order back to me to make sure it was correct.  She told me it will be ready in 25 minutes it was ready when I got there and piping hot. Our order that day was a buffalo chicken salad, Philly cheesesteak/fries, kids cheeseburger and fries and 2 slices of apple pie. The only suggestion I would make is that they give a little more fries for their take out orders. The apple pie is always our highlight very good! Homemade flaky crust and juicy apple slices and I love their strawberry pie as well. They always give free smiley cookies with your order, that's a nice touch since my little boy loves them. This is not fast food, so when you want something quick, taste good, good quality and your in a hurry phone Eat n Park and do a take out order."}
{"text":"I've had Sunday brunch here a few times with my friend and her son and we always have a good time. This location is clean, service is great. There is sometimes a wait but usually not more than a few minutes. The all you can eat brunch buffet has fried chicken and sides, eggs, French toast, soups and small salad bar. The bakery items are also pretty good."}
{"text":"I went to Eat N Park today with my coworkers for a free cup o Joe since we voted today ... the cashier wouldn't give it to us unless we turned in our voter receipt. Food was good however the service was very slow. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"I normally don't review chains, but I was told this was a Pittsburgh staple, so here I am, reviewing a chain.

I'm from Jersey.  I'm used to real Jersey diners.  This diner, in comparison, is kinda the equivalent to Friendly's.  If you can't make it to Jersey for your diner needs, at least patronize an independent business instead."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  You get what you expect from a place called \"Eat N Park.\"  The service (late Sunday morning) was slow.  But, what ticked me off was what seemed to be discrimination in where people were seated.  All of the Black, Hispanic, and Asian people were seated at the back, along with anyone with obvious physical or mental disabilities, and those who were obese.  I guess they want all of the \"normal\" white families to feel comfortable with their own up at the front."}
{"text":"I'm mostly commenting on the redesign of this restaurant. 

I really like the new design. I'm not sure if the Waterfront EnP is the first one with the new design, but it is somewhat similar to that one. However, they've tried add some local Squirrel HIll color. For example, they have pictures of the neighborhood on all of the walls.. They also have the very trendy garage door front to open up on nice days. The tables and chairs are definitely a step up from what they had previously, and the fireplace is a nice touch (even if I've never seen them use it). The bathrooms have also been spiffed up, which is nice. Overall it feels a little nicer and \"lighter\" inside.

You won't mistake EnP for a trendy restaurant but this redesign is definitely an improvement from the rather drab environment previously.

The food? Well, it's Eat n' Park, so there you go. We generally have good service at this one, although we've gotten to know some of the waitstaff which helps."}
{"text":"Come here on a Saturday about 9:30pm.  Order the soup and salad bar because I was not all that hungry, and I wanted the chili.  
First of all, I stand to get seated for about 5 minutes.  Then the hostess takes me to the table.  5 more minutes and not a waiter/waitress in sight.  Finally the hostess
 comes to get my drink order, and I order the soup and salad bar.  She tells me I can go up.  
First thing I see is that there are no spoons or serving implements on many of the buffet dishes. A few salad plates, and a few cups for the soups.  But there is chili.
So I make a salad with the few serving implements there, and get a bowl of chili.  
First off, the chili was hot.  Not seasoning wise...temperature wise.  Ok.  But I was able to eat just two spoons of it.  It tasted like someone dumped ten pounds of salt in it.  Inedible.  I then noticed them taking everything off the buffet.  No one said the buffet was closing, or that they were changing it.  And while serving myself, this mysterious unknown waiter brought me this flat Coke.  So you can't get more soup...or salad...and I look at the buffet on the way out of the restaurant, and they just brought out fruit....and no serving spoons.  You kidding me???
So I eat my salad and the hostess comes over and says \"Has your waiter been over?\" I answer \"Who would that be?\".  She runs off to find this person.  Finally another waitress comes over.  I order another Coke.  Never offered anything else, and I was still hungry.
Another ten minute wait to get the check.  I paid, and I left a $ 1.00 tip.  Hopefully some ghost that works there got that.  Because I will be dead before I think of coming back.  
I used to like Eat n' Park.  But these last few trips to their restaurants make me think they are not long for this world if they keep this up. 
Good thing that Speedway Café was open so I could get some real food in me."}
{"text":"Pretty good food in a pinch.  Breakfast choices are better than average.  One of the few remaining places with a salad bar.  I would recommend this restaurant over some other eat n parks."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Eat'n Park locations and they're typically the same. This one was not par for the course. We visited at around 10:45am on a Sunday and it was packed. To be honest, this is probably the smallest E'n P that I've been inside, but it felt even smaller with the crowd waiting at the door. As we waited for our seats, I began to notice the thick dust on top of the picture frames, trim and everything higher than eye level in the entry way. It was quite gross. 

Once seated, we quickly ordered the breakfast/brunch bar. The food on the smaller than usual bar was soggy and sparse. As we finished our first plate, the bar was converted for brunch. This included salad and a few toppings. The rest seemed the same. 

My son ordered a cheeseburger kids meal. His burger arrived cold and cheese unmelted. The best thing about our experience was the coffee and friendly waitress. We won't return to this location, sadly. However, Eat'n Park still has our business at the other locations we frequent."}
{"text":"Two words - salad bar!!!!!!

If you are a sucker for a good salad you need to come here and build your own heaping plate complete with delicious homemade dressings.

Their soups are excellent - my fave is the chili (it's a soupier version) and the stuffed pepper soup.

Their fried zucchini and provolone sticks are hand-battered and always fresh; both go amazing with their famous ranch dressing. 

As for entrees- I honestly have never found one that is absolutely to die for- most are just homemade classics and modern American eats. They add in a special dish here and there (like a summer salad or spicy pasta dish or fish dish during lent) as well. I personally enjoy their rosemary chicken breast with mashed potatoes (ask for rosemary sauce on the potatoes instead of gravy - yummy), their shredded pot roast sandwich with the salad bar, and also the Santa Fe turkey sandwich which sadly was taken off of the menu when I was last there- I think they may bring it back as a limited item in the future as it was reasonably popular.

Their cinnamon rolls (\"stickies\") are delicious as well, and if you aren't already stuffed, try the \"stickies a la mode\" for dessert. Or one of their many homemade pies, one of which is at a discounted price every month. 

Don't ignore this hometown staple! It's as dear to Pittsburghers as Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"This is me, popping my Eat'n Park cherry.

This apparently used to be the Eat'n Park Corporate headquarters before the HQ was moved to the Waterfront.  I thought it looked rather odd as a two story building.  It has a bit of a Shoney's feel to it on the inside, just not as dirty nor as much white trash is present.  There is a soup and salad bar for those that cannot live without their rabbit food and a menu for everyone else.  The menu has breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Deciding to be adventurous, I went ahead and substituted the soup and salad bar for one of my sides.  I could have just ordered the soup, but for 50cents more, I got the whole bar and unlimited soup.  On the smorgasborg for the night:

Pepsi and Mug Rootbear
Pulled pot roast sandwich with soup/salad bar (Chicken Soup, Cottage cheese, etc.)

Buffalo chicken strips with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and soup/salad bar (Italian Wedding soup, roll, salad)

Since the bar was self-serve, I started the browsing process.  I walked around the bar then served myself a bowl of the wedding soup and returned to the table.  The wedding soup was actually decent compared to a lot of the more expensive restaurants in the area and I had another bowl as I waited for my entree to arrive.  During my first and second trips to the bar, I was putting together flavors in my mind and on my third trip I created a salad (spinach greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, sunflower seeds, and balsamic vinaigrette.  

I was quite surprised when I took my first bite of the salad.  Everything was fresh and crisp while the balsamic vinaigrette ACTUALLY tasted like balsamic vinaigrette.  I was hooked on this place before even trying my entree.  I could come back and get the salad bar any night that had the Italian Wedding soup and I would be just fine.  As I consumed my second plate of salad my entree arrived.  Contrary to the rest of the meal, it didn't look that appealing.

I finished the salad and started on the mashed potatoes.  I have been spoiled with fresh mashed potatoes too often -- I couldn't eat them.  I moved on to the buffalo chicken strips and had a slightly better experience.  After eating a few of the strips, I came to the conclusion that this entree wasn't made with that Eat'n Park smiley face like the soup was.  Would I get the strips again? Maybe.  I must say, that the salad bar impressed me. I am fairly picky about my veggies, and while it doesn't have a lot of things on the bar there are a lot of things that I like.  I will return."}
{"text":"I like this Eat'n Park. Even though it is a chain, not all of them are created equal. The wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an Eat'n Park is worth patronizing.  Eating here, I change my mentality a bit. I always order the seven dollar BBQ burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. In my mind, I always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. When the salad bar is kept stocked, it has some really good and fresh items. I love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. I wish other Eat'n Parks were more like this one."}
{"text":"This is an older retail store.  I normally have a loving relationship with Eat 'n Park, but this one just didn't hit home for me.  I came during the Sunday Brunch Buffet; my friend partook, I abstained after seeing the fare.  I ordered two eggs over-easy with a side of toast.  Getting beyond the murky, dated feel of the store, it was actually fairly clean on the interior and in the restrooms.  

I received my food and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Maybe not a big deal for some, but you would be surprised at how often over-easy comes out over-hard or, worse, uncooked.  I think the real reason I enjoy Eat 'n Park most of the time is the normal salad bar items."}
{"text":"food is par at best .. the \"pumpkin\"  pie milkshake is gross. and the super burger... well there is NOTHING super about it ....only thing that was good /not great but good and gets one star was the cookie....  we were at the steelers game last night and they advertised a free superburger if the steelers sacked the quarterback in the 2nd quarter.  which they did because they are awesome !!! when we went to pay they wanted to take our tickets.... i get that companies have policies but then inform the guest when they tell you they are there for that promotion... we are from california and the promotion is for 1 day ... how many burgers do you think im gonna eat... hahahaha ... sad part is pittsburgh is an amazing city with some of the nicest people i have EVER met... worst part of Pittsburgh is Eat'N Park i will NEVER visit on of their establishments ever again.  terrible customer service , terrible management and terrible corporate (not the good kinda terrible either ) . so many resturant choices ...sad we wasted our time eating here..l get a big mac its cheaper and tastes way better!!!! UPDATE: just spoke to sara at corporate ... they are fully aware of this issue and have done nothing as a company to fix it.  it feels like  they want to trick you into the situation .. the waitress is supposed to tell the customer...so if they dont its just too bad for the customer ...  how about make a copy of the ticket and stamp the back ...clearly they dont want you to get the free burger.  hey Eat n' Park just dont do the promotion .... booooooo.. no wonder none of the local fans in our section were excited about that gross burger..."}
{"text":"Nothing special, the place was dead. Salad bar was clean, parmesan crusted chicken was good. Service to get seated was slow, but waitress did a nice job. Soup selection was good on a freezing cold night"}
{"text":"In a huge hurry so grabbing take out. Courtesy describes staff, trainee devinoee was great"}
{"text":"\"I wish someone would just put a bag over her head and knock her up so I can get some grandkids.\"  In addition to the usual hotcakes and eggs, apparently our waitress' daughter was a daily special that morning.

Preferring that all of the eggs in my social life remain unfertilized, I opted instead for the Italian Breakfast Club which turned out to be the dog's bollocks.  And for good reason; If you want to enjoy eating here, it is highly recommend that you not use the nutritional info calculator on E'nP's website.  After checking the stats on my breakfast I now realize I should have ordered it with a side of Lipitor.

Added bonus -- as a consolation prize for not taking her daughter home, our waitress hooked us up with some free cookies for the road.

Cliff Notes version: dining at Eat'n Park is kind of like going to Denny's but without the shame."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is always hit or miss. Great for a quick family breakfast. Buffett for kids is free with an adult. Boom."}
{"text":"I'm totally biased because I grew up around Pittsburgh and ate at Eat 'n Park all the time.  It's more than just a diner, it brings back all kinds of memories.  Now that I'm a \"diner connoisseur\" I have to say that the old E'nP still delivers. Is it the best food in the world?  No, of course not. But it hits the spot with eggs, bacon, flapjacks, black coffee, and a new breakfast buffet (did someone say unlimited bacon?).  Add a bunch of friendly waitstaff wearing Steelers and Pirates jerseys and I feel at home.  So, if you want your small-batch, farm-to-table, hand-crafted meal, there are plenty of other places to go in Pittsburgh.  But if you want a plain-old hearty breakfast with memories of eating at the counter with your dad after a Pirates game, go to Eat 'n Park."}
{"text":"I've had frozen microwave meals better than eat n park. Place is dirty, staff is rude, food is bland and cold. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"i would give this place no stars was there tuesday the waitress asked me 2 times if i was ready to eat i said i was thinking on a couple of things well almost a half hr passed i was ready to eat she went off on me for what i wanted to get something to eat she said call the cops for what asking to eat im in that place a few days aweek no more i know the manger called corporate still waiting for a response no more money eatnpark just 2 weeks earlier i had speghetti it had a bread tie in it i could have choked on the damn thing showed the manager he apologized use to like eatnpark no more money from me"}
{"text":"So I was not happy that we ended up here but that quickly changed once I got my food. I'm a sucker for chicken fingers and they had the best honey mustard EVER!! And inexpensive as well. So if you in the Burgh and it's late and everything else is closed this wont disappoint."}
{"text":"This is the closest Eat N Park to me, and it's the same as others, though my in laws hit this place pretty regularly.  Every time we go the staff remembers us and is conversational and friendly, additionally I have a daughter who is 14 months old and the cheap dining options for her are nice.

It's friendly that's why they get the extra star, the food is basic finer fare, it's not a date place...well strike that...there is a charm to taking a date to Eat N Park after a nice evening to grab some late dessert and prolong an evening."}
{"text":"Crazy, I wrote a review of this Eat N Park a year ago and it's been removed by Yelp?! It was a good review too. I don't understand why reviews by long standing Yelpers like myself get removed! 

Your everyday ENP, good breakfasts, solid meals, soup and salad bar, late night and Sunday Breakfast buffet, and those Smiley Cookies."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh restaurant. Breakfast available any time of the day or night. The soup and salad buffet is always a favorite. Open 24/7, The midnight breakfast buffet is great to soak up the alcohol from a bender. The bear claw is always a favorite, warm and sweet, dripping with butter! It's pure Pittsburgh whether you're coming from church, or coming in for a late night bite."}
{"text":"Okay Eat N' Park, come clean, you DID change the recipe for the smiley cookie, fess up! Something is missing, skimping on the bourbon vanilla? Lemon extract from the icing? They just don't taste like they used to! My advice, find the original recipe and go back to it! 

Good coffee, great breakfasts, love the salad bar, that potato soup is still creamy and satisfying as I remember. Love the whole grain & blueberry pancakes too. 

Eat n Park has been a great place to go after a night of imbibing much alcohol. Getting a big stack to soak up the old fashioneds and martinies, extra butter and syrup! And, that amazing corned beef hash on English muffins with two sunny side up eggs, or just a huge class of whole milk and a buttery bear claw. These all helped me lessen pain of morning hangovers on many occasion. 

It's a Pittsburgh classic, but dang, you did mess with the cookies, I know ya did!"}
{"text":"Ate here before heading out on a road trip. The food is very cheap and they have a lot of menu options. Reminds me of Bakers Square. They get a 3 bc my friend and I waited almost 15 to 20 minutes after we were seated before our waitress came. She was really nice and sweet but she messed up my order. And either she wasn't paying attention to what I said or the menu has false info but the medium steak i ordered with my eggs was just a well done hamburger patty! That REALLY pissed me off bc the menu specifically named a steak cut and nothing about a steak-shaped beef patty with grill lines on it! Oh well..."}
{"text":"The zucchini planks were thin, crispy, and delicious. Paired with the soup and salad bar, it was a pretty satisfying meal for a very low price."}
{"text":"I would whole heartily agree with the recent reviews of poor service and experience at this location. It is not what it once was. I have experienced wait staff and hosts who do not care and are not very kind. Poor attentiveness to cleaning tables and lack luster presentation of food. Definitely not one of their better locations. Don't go after 8pm, your service and entire experience will be horrible."}
{"text":"Ate here on 8/21/14.

Eat N Park has really gone downhill. I've eaten at locations all over Pittsburgh for about fifteen years and the most recent trip was the most disappointing. Like most restaurants today the prices are up and the quality is down.

Ordered the Turkey Club, like I have many times before, and was disappointed to find it no longer comes with a side. Same price, maybe even slightly more, now with smaller portions and no fries. Ordered a side of fries, for additional cost, and was shocked when the server brought out a tiny plate usually reserved for carrying a dinner roll. This is easily a quarter the size you used to get. Plus the smallest coffee cups I've ever seen.

The staff was friendly, the server was kind of clueless.

I'll think twice about returning."}
{"text":"The hamburgers and fries taste better than other eat n parks i have eaten at. I dont know why maybe a different food distributor. Clean,  the service is good."}
{"text":"As a non-Pennsylvanian, I am baffled at how many Eat N Parks there are and how they stay in business. I ate at this Squirrel Hill location the first week I moved to Pittsburgh and the food was mediocre at best. I tried another location in Edgewood and it was mediocre bordering on tasteless. In a town with so many restaurant options, I can't believe that people still eat here. Yes, the smiley cookies are good, but a cookie does not a whole restaurant make. At the risk of sounding dramatic, this place is an affront to diners and greasy spoons everywhere."}
{"text":"Yummy food. And Donna the waitress made our dining experience fantastic. She sang us a song as she walked us to our seat, gave us refills before we even needed them, dealt with a really, really bitter rude customer sitting behind us in the kindest, most professional way, we even invited her over to eat some pie at my boyfriend's mom's! We live in New York City, and have gotten used to NOT receiving the great service that Donna provided us so her positivity and attentiveness meant even more to us. THANKS DONNA and EAT N' PARK, YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know that it's cheap diner food, but c'mon... You have your corporate headquarters within walking distance and this is all you can serve up? 

My husband and I were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this Eat 'N Park location for the first time. I had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so I thought this restaurant would be worth a try.

I ordered several items - Sweet Potato Fries with Apple Butter Dip, Hot Chocolate, and Pumpkin Creme Pie. I think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. Anyway, every item was problematic in some way. The fries were good, but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet. The hot chocolate had \"creative\" chocolate syrup drizzling, that was running all down the cup and saucer. I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes. The pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a 5 year old. It looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate, where it appeared very flat and unappetizing.

However, our waitress was the sweetest, middle-aged woman! Our food took a little time to get to our table (not too bad though) and she comped two of the items (I believe the Hot Chocolate and the pie) from our bill. She was very attentive and kind while we dined there, and I made sure that my husband gave her a good tip. If I remembered her name, I would definitely mention it in this review.

However, despite our kind service, I'm not planning on returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a lot when I came into the restaurant... but it came nowhere near meeting my very low expectations.

This location is old and not very clean. After mediocre experiences at other Eat'n Park restaurants, I decided to just order a Chai Tea. I wasn't expecting Starbucks, but wow, it was by far the worst beverage I've ever had. It tasted like the drink was only a combination of cream, sugar, and water.

I don't plan on returning here any time soon!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3.5 stars. The food is decent and I really like the breakfast buffet and the soup & salad bar. Customer service has always been mediocre. Sometimes you'll get a server who is really good and other times you won't. After being seated yesterday evening we had to wait 15 minutes for our waitress to come to our table. Twice she quickly walked by and said \"I'll be with you in a minute!\" At least give us glasses of water! When she finally came we asked if we could an apperizer on the house because of the inconvenience. She said, \"It's not within my power!\"  :0\"}
{"text":"Growing up in Pittsburgh, I can't help but have a soft spot for Eat'n Park. The smiley cookies alone are super nostalgic and remind me of all the times I came here with my family when I was a kid. I still love Eat'n Park just as much, and this location has treated me well each time I've visited it.

The salad bar at Eat'n Park has always been one of my favorites. They feature a rotating selection of soups, fruit, muffins, salad, etc. It won't break the bank, either, as my boyfriend and I each got an appetizer along with the salad bar for under $30. You can't beat it! The appetizer portions were big enough to be the perfect meal with a cup of soup and a salad. We went on a Sunday, and the soup of the day is potato soup, which is my absolute favorite soup here. They also have potato soup on Wednesdays, and on the Sunday we visited they also had classic chicken noodle. My boyfriend was kind of bummed they didn't have chili because that's his favorite, but maybe next time!

For our appetizers, we got the mac and cheese bites and fried zucchini. The portion of fried zucchini we got was enormous! It was more than enough for two people to share, and then some! The mac and cheese bites are a newer addition to the Eat'n Park menu, and they were also pretty good. Our waiter was quick to take our order and our food arrived right after we got our first go at the salad bar.

Overall, we had a great experience here. Everything tasted awesome, especially that famous potato soup! The service was fast and friendly, and we even decided to take an apple pie home to enjoy for dessert. Eat'n Park's slogan is \"The Place for Smiles,\" and our visit to the Robinson location definitely left us smiling!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friend, because she likes this place. I tried some kind of fish pasta and it was so so, it didnt even feel like fish. Food didnt have taste."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. 
One time I ordered a turkey burger and it wasn't cooked through. Another time I had the basket of fried zucchini and it was burned. That time the waitress was covered in food remains & stains and kept chatting with the booth next to us. I won't go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst eat n parks in the area. Every time I'm here (been 10+ times this year tho I think I've finally given up) there is NO HOST, you stand up front trying to get seated , trying to pay, just a mess. The food is often luke warm and I even got sick  a few months ago on the salad bar. The servers are always disappearing so the service is horrendous. I have had to knock on the kitchen door to pay my check , go get a server off the floor to be seated, etc. it's ridiculous. Whoever the manager is here should be fired. Everyone knows good service is a tough business, but this is beyond absurd and way below normal eat n park standards. Oh---and never ANY silverware put out! No spoons at the salad bar, have to hunt someone down for a fork and knife-Get it together !"}
{"text":"I don't really review chain places unless I'm extremely unimpressed or extremely impressed. This ENP is great! We typically order late take-out once a month and the employees are always so friendly and sweet! Everything is packed neat and they always offer our pups some treats! 

Food is always good (can't really mess up diner food). Thanks for always giving us a pleasurable experience!"}
{"text":"Suing small bakeries around the country who have been making smiley cookies longer than you people have been open!!!! Shame on you. I would never dine at your establishment. You abuse trademark laws. So ridiculous."}
{"text":"Originally founded in Pittsburgh in 1949 as one of the world's first carhop restaurants, Eat'n Park Restaurant is today pretty much like a Shoney's except in the architecture and appearance of most of its building. They kind of stand out in design having a 1950's look about them, but of course they no longer have any carhop service. 

This particular Eat'n Park has both a buffet and table service. I elected for the table service ordering a cup of chili along with a cup of chili. Though I wasn't very impressed with the chili the may be because of my jaded tastes due to chili overexposure at some of the chili cook-offs I had recently attended. I was however impressed with their Reuben which contained generous slices of lean corn beef, tasty sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Thousand Island dressing in between slices of fresh tasting rye bread; a sandwich I would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here the other night. Our waitress was very nice and the food was good. Plus the smiley face cookies are just adorable so.."}
{"text":"Another one star experience. Only reason we went there cause it was getting late   Ordered super burger combo and grilled chicken with baked potato.  45 minutes till it arrived at table.  Waitress couldn't care less.  So I didn't feel bad about no tip.  Why can this eat n park have service in the morning but not in the evening."}
{"text":"Finally have a good experience at Eat'n Park. Penn hills Eat n Park had friendly server. Help was all friendly and seemed to work together. Food come out fast and hot"}
{"text":"My party and I went here at about 2am. The waitress was extremely nice, but the food took forever. When we finally got our food, it was all COLD! Like it was microwaved then sat out for a half hour. We were all not happy."}
{"text":"Love Eat N Park, its a Pittsburgh staple. How can you not eat here? Its a good location with friendly staff. My only two cons are this...1. Having the salad bar right where everyones walking to the kitchen and to their seats its a cluster. Especially if your at the salad bar you have the added worry of bumping someone. The other one is its not restocked as quickly as it should be. Other than that its great!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I've always been an Eat n Park fan, but this place was awful. It was a Friday night and granted it was pretty busy, but gawwwwwd. It seemed like every single employee was around 16 years old. The service was very slow. We ordered an appetizer platter and cheese fries to split. Easy enough, right? Well they didn't fry anything long enough so it was soggy and all the breading was falling off everything. My drink was never refilled. Even worse, we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to us!

Half an hour later the server decides to ask \"You gettin' dessert?\" We ordered slices of pie to go. My \"slice\" of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust. We went up front to pay to find one lady at the register (who seemed to be the sole adult employee) counting her drawer and nobody else in sight. We stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us. A few more minutes and finally the girl who was our server rings us up. I asked for a different, ACTUAL slice of pie, which she managed to get about five minutes later. Basically the whole experience was pure torture, which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Breakfast was hot,  came cooked correctly,  waitress was great.   Standard chain breakfast stuff,  nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Probably the worse service I've ever had at any eat n park. I ordered to go in the rain & they asked me to come in. The woman ringing my order didn't even acknowledge me, no hello or anything, then gave me my to go order with no utensils. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Early morning breakfast buffet = epic winning. Let me paint a scenario for you:

It's 1230AM Saturday. You've imbibed a fair amount after what amounts to a fairly miserable week. You want food, without prejudice.You think to yourself, \"I could really go for a waffle, blueberry muffin, biscuits, bacon, and cantaloupe. All on the same plate. All smothered in a layer of syrup, followed by a layer of melted cheese product, followed by as much country gravy as the plate can possibly hold. And I want to not only be hungover tomorrow, but also regret every delicious food mistake I've made in the past 8 hours. And when I'm all done, I want to eat a cookie that looks at me and subconsciously says 'don't worry friend, I'm not judging your eating habits, this smile is because you're awesome.'\" And then you realize that cookie is absolutely right - you are awesome. And so you go to Eat n' Park for that glorious 1AM breakfast buffet.

So gross to think about, but so satisfying to experience.

Don't judge me."}
{"text":"Poor establishment.. Went here on a Sunday for some recovery breakfast... They seated us.. After 20 minutes still no waiter so we just left out the side door."}

I love the atmosphere in here. During the day it is a great place to bring my 4 kids. The servers have always been incredible at accommodating the large group and always pay special attention to my kids. When I'm there late at night, it feels like a big fun family. Mistakes happen every so often but it is immedietly corrected. I always have a great time here and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff!  We had a great experience here on our way home from kennywood.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love Eat n park and in fact,it's one of my favorite eating places in America,I love the food and I love their dirty rice. We've been to this location a few times and we always have good experience all the time, I always get rosemary chicken,dirty rice and veggies and their oreo shake is my favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to different Eat'nPark reataurants but this is my first time dining in this location. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon around 4pm ish,the place wasn't packed,we got a seat we wanted,as usual,we ordered the fried zuchini as starter and it was good,my husband got the chicken parmesan and it was my first time ordering the chicken quisadilla. I thought it was good,cheesy and tasty,i will probably order quisadilla in the future for takeout. One more thing,our server was very nice and bubbly,she was full energy!"}
{"text":"So it was a typical family Sunday,we arrived at around 130ish,it wasn't crowded,but we waited for probably 3 mins before we got seated,this guy at the cashier who didn't want to show up for work gave us the menu and left,I asked if the breakfast buffet was available and he just shrugged his shoulders and said I think so. Our waitress came and took our orders,she was okay but minutes later,she advised us that someone is gonna take over our table and introduced us to another waitress,my daughter got a breakfast buffet so she was already eating, 40 mins later,our waitress came with my baked cod and my husband's sandwiches (I forgot the name),she told us that our appetizer was given to another customer so they have to make it again. What's the point of ordering an appetizer when it's being serve as a dessert so I told my husband to cancel it. Our food wasn't hot that means that it's been sitting in the kitchen and nobody cared. I was starving so I didn't bother complaining. Now my husband after 2 bites on his sandwich noticed a broken toothpick in his food. It was disgusting! We stopped eating,long story short,Brittany the mgr wasn't even apologetic told us that their kitchen is so busy and told us to take care of the bill and left. We didn't know what she meant but we thought she's Gonna bring us our bill so we can pay and left,so we waited again for 5 mins and we decided to go to the cashier and pay. Brittany actually decided that not letting us pay would compensate us. The experience was horrible,food was disgusting,customer service sucked. We came home and made our lunch at 4pm."}
{"text":"Used to actually work here when I was a young man, we returned here many many years later and had lunch and was very happy.  It was just like coming home, the food was still the same as it was over thirty years ago.  Good to see Hingis don't change unless they have to."}
{"text":"Every eat n park is different, referring to the service and food quality. I like this establishment because of the salad bar (the Dormont and Banksville ones are my top choices), and the fact that this place is all about the kiddos. It is not too over priced, but to each their own. I particularly like the chicken Romano. It has a tasty white wine sauce to it. The other go to's for dinner is the baked floridian(in orange juice), and the Rosemary chicken. For breakfast: I would just go for the buffet. There is plenty to choose from and they have a decent breakfast/sausage gravy. Lunch: the buffalo chx wrap, turkey club, and the pot roast sandwich. 
They have very good pies. The strawberry pie is our favorite. Pretty soon, they should be having their pie special (a slice for $2)."}
{"text":"Shredded beef sandwich its good; just make sure to get the gravy on your fries too!"}
{"text":"My experience was subpar at best the hostess didnt even offer to take our coats.  Our table was terrible we sat in an hard cusioned like material which hurt my bottom and when the \"waitress\" offered us water it did not taste like it was bottled in spain like we asked for in the beginning. Our evening then became even more nightmarish than one could ever hope for. We asked for the fresh tilapia stuffed with creme freshe and the waiter looked at us like we were foreigners something. So we had to settle for chicken fingers. And when i went to the restroom to pass those horrendous monstrosities of mutated chicken there wasnt even one of those bathroom people there to offer me a towel and their colourful company. i had to end up toweling myself with a blow dryer. I still tipped the blow dryer by inserting silver dollars into those slots. Overall you will never see me there again and i will take my business to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Typical Eat'n Park. I was traveling and staying in Moon overnight so I could get to the airport at the crack of dawn...before the roosters crowed. I wanted something quick so I stopped by Eat'n Park for their salad bar. The restaurant is under construction but still open for business. I hope the construction will take place on the inside at some point as it needs some tender lovin' care. 

The hostess and server were both very nice so 5 stars for them. The salad bar was just okay. Nothing spectacular as far as salad bars go. They have all that you need for a salad so I'll give them that. 

My 3 star is based on the fact that I can't say that I am a fan of Eat'n Park. I ate there because there weren't too many other choices for me in Moon."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal anytime I have come here. The service is always wonderful and the food is always hot and delicious!!! By far my favorite restaurant in the north hills!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at th is eat n park the other day. Even though it was busy at lunch, we were seated quickly and the hostess suggested some things we might like. Our server was a Amy.  She was so friendly and greeted us quickly even though she was busy. Our food came quickly, and it was perfect. Amy was so outgoing and happy and took really good care of us. It's always nice to be saved by someone who genuinely seems like they are having fun. We don't go out for a sit down lunch often, and we really enjoyed our visit. Thanks a bunch."}
{"text":"We had 20 people so we had our own room. The server Janee started off strong setting a tone for our meal that she would be organized and on point.  Unfortunately, that was the high point of this service.  We sat there for 20 minutes without drinks, in fact some meals started coming out and we still didn't have our beverages.  Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.  I'm not sure why they couldn't just get pitchers.....I got the salad bar only, it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross, I thought the chili was overly salty.  The other people we were with didn't have much good to say about their meals, with the exception of the angus burger.  Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.  I'm not sure it was all her fault as she didn't seem to have a staff that was working to support her, just catch her up as needed.  I think if you have 20 people at a table 2-3 staff members would make you more successful.  When we went to leave I bought a dozen of the sugar cookies.  The person at the counter didn't know how to ring them up and was quite rude when I asked for her to ring them up, like I was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurant's products.  That was my first time at Eat'n Park and I think I would prefer to just eat at Denny's next time."}
{"text":"My husband & I used to eat at the Monongahela location all the time & we loved it.  We moved away & stopped going.....we came back a couple of years ago & was happy to be eating at one of our favorite places again.  Gee...were we disappointed !!    The food became just average, but with the average food, the prices went up !!    The salad bar was always included in with the entree & it was a really good salad bar.  Now, we find out that we had to pay extra for a salad bar that only had about half the items & the entree wasn't that good.  Needless to say we found this to be the case at 2 locations so we've never went back. 
We'll just take our dining business somewhere else....too bad for Eat'n Park."}
{"text":"Ah, Eat n' Park. They are consistently... open. 

What is notable here is the complete and utter absence of hipsters, posers, snobs, or any sort of pretension whatsoever. What you find at Eat 'n Park instead are Pittsburgh's blue collar families, senior citizens, and teenagers out for an inexpensive meal at a surprisingly high-quality local diner chain. The \"super burger\" is basically a Big Mac without all the grease,  and is actually quite satisfying. The salad bar is always fresh and kept well stocked (well, sometimes the customers manage to fish out all the chicken and noodles from the chicken noodle soup, leaving only the broth). The service is top-notch, with friendly waitstaff who could teach the waiters and waitresses at some of the more expensive fine dining establishments the area a thing or two about customer service.

And, they have pie."}
{"text":"We come here alot but i think thats based on location and price. Food and service are hit and miss. I love the soup and salad as does my daughter and she is free which is great. You can get the meal w the soup and salad and bring the meal home from filling up on the bar."}
{"text":"Ok... this is my 3rd time eating here... Lord I hate that I have been in Pittsburgh for a month and had been eating some pretty crappy food! I have had the Grilled chicken flat bread 3 times and the stuffed cod to take with me. Forget about the cod... that grilled chicken flatbread though? ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! The flat bread is soft and fresh, grilled chicken is delicious and smokey then the cheese, lettuce, fresh salsa, grilled onions and peppers drizzled with chipotle sauce has blown my mind! I didn't think it could be that great so I have ordered it 3x and every single time it's has been consistently delicious. The staff is friendly and gives you that feeling like they know you, I watch different servers attend to different customers and they just had a really great vibe (except for 2, they looked tired as hell and a bit grumpy)! My server, Heather, was great! She told me what was good on the menu what was not, she was totally honest. I love an honest server, don't just say that something is popular or good just to say it. The food is inexpensive and the portions are great."}
{"text":"Just as good as any other Eat 'n Park I have visted. My 2 year old loves this place very family friendly and a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the Waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \"closed\" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page!"}
{"text":"Whenever we feel like a salad for dinner, we go to the place for smiles.  Today the salad bar was stocked.nicely with fresh veggies that looked and tasted fresh.  If always hits the spot.

Rich ordered a chicken club sandwich with fries - always a good choice.  I opted for a new item - the chicken fajita flatbread. Overall it was decent, but it needed a little less sauce and the chicken was overcooked.  It wasn't bad though.

We had to buy smiley cookies to take home.  They're soft and sweet, like me :)  

Not a bad trip to Eat n Park today.  The salad bar hit the spot and we left with smiles."}
{"text":"Fow what it is this eat n park really is a lot better then i remember. I also really like and approve of them offering healthier lower calorie option that have some variety and taste good."}
{"text":"This  Eat n Park  location is pretty good.  What I really like about this place is that it essentially the zone 4 police stations real HQ.  Go to the station house and there might be a disinterested officer behind the desk.  Instead just head over to the eat n' park on Murray.  No doubt you'll find at least four officers, especially in the morning.

You'll be able to feel quite safe while you enjoy your smiley waffle."}
{"text":"I won't be back.  My daughter and I ordered lunch take out. She was missing the bacon from her breakfast for lunch order and they didn't supply us with syrup for pancakes. They should try choking down their own pancakes with no syrup. Needless to say, they ended up in the garbage. Plus, The turkey sausage is among the worst I've ever had.  The entire meal was cold and uneaten. 

We called to complain and the person who answered admitted they messed up our order and said they'd send us a gift card. True to their awful service, we never received it.  We've stopped going here completely. There are wayyyyy too many options around."}
{"text":"First time at an eat n park. Came in and was greeted by the hostess and the dessert display case. We ordered breakfast and the food was as we expected. Healthy smiley was good and came out quickly. Belgian waffle was crispy and hot. Good service and attentive staff that comes by and checks on you in case you need anything. Left with a smiley cookie to go. It was awesome because I ate it before we got to the car."}
{"text":"Well, I love Eat'n Park.  I can't get enough of it!  There's just something about that ranch!

Anyways, I have a few go to's.  Salad bar with chicken finger entre, salad bar with cheese sticks, or buffalo chicken salad.  Most of the time I get something with the salad bar because I can eat that ranch for days.  Their apple pie and Oreo pie are both good classic desserts.

Overall, the enp quality is meh, service is all over the place, but there's just something about bleh diner food that keeps us sucked in!"}
{"text":"Fine location with everything standard you expect from Eat n Park. Nothing special as while I prefer places that aren't chain, this got the job done when we were in a hurry. Wasn't busy on Saturday at 10:30 which I thought was strange but maybe it's the location. The waitress was nice and quickly corrected the problem when she accidentally brought hash browns instead of home fries. It looks clean but I didn't get the bathroom. Both of us ate breakfast for $12 not including tip which is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Well its a chain breakfast place but it does have a wider variety of lattes and fresh fruit and breads to choose from and even turkey sausage.  Service was excellent here."}
{"text":"It's Eat'n Park.  It ain't gourmet, ya know?  It's basic, good grub at a basic, good price.  Good in a pinch.  

The upside for me?  It's got gluten-free dining covered.  And quite nicely, too.  I enjoyed a decent Eggs Benedict here the other day - they even put it on gluten-free bun halves instead of the gluten-laden English muffin it would normally come on.  The hollandaise was wonderful!

Thanks Eat'n Park for thinking of us who need to eat gluten-free!"}
{"text":"On the way to Pitsburgh Airport I decided to stop by here with my family because I see these everywhere and was curious what it was like.  Anyone else that is curious...just stop here.  Food is way sub-par, establishment was not very clean....I would rather make a sandwich at home then spend $10 to eat here.  Scrambled eggs were overcooked and hard as can be.  Pancakes tasted a little gritty - I had to check to see if they were cooked all the way.  French toast tasted like eggs.  Need I say more?  I would rather eat at Denny's or IHOP than this place.  Not sure why this chain is on every block."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my visit, stopping here after picking up a college student from downtown Pittsburgh on our way to Slippery Rock University for breakfast.  
Our server was very pleasant and efficient.  I ordered a hot chocolate because I was chilled from the weather.  I was sooo very pleased to see what she brought back for me -- a huge cup topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  
There were plenty breakfast options.  I selected the banana foster french toast with bacon and my comrade chose chocolate chip pancakes.  I didn't hear any complaints out of him and the plate was bare so, I'd say he enjoyed his dish.  Mine?  Very good, and, again, the plate was left bare."}
{"text":"I went here more than I care to admit. I usually got a turkey club or one of the egg breakfasts. Poached? Yes! With a cheap, fatty steak? Yes! And rye toast? Also yes!  And the pancakes + blueberries were decent too. I wouldn't get too adventurous or expect too much, but it's handy, esp if you want to show up in grubby workout clothes and build your own salad at the salad bar. 

The service at this location was always good (sometimes great) and I liked it for people watching. Nice atmosphere at odd hours - late at night, or very early, or in the middle of the morning, on a weekday. Yeah, it's a chain, but it's also very Pittsburgh. Very.

That said, the cookies taste vaguely like Play-Doh and I would never order dessert or wait for a table here. 24/7"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place for what it is. Clean, decent food, fast and friendly service. The superburger was fresh and the fries crispy. The salad bar was nicely stocked."}
{"text":"Frequented this place during our very brief stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. We don't have this chain on the west coast-but I thought this place was decent. Not too many choices in the area...I think we came twice. On both occasions the staff was very friendly, and service was courteous and prompt.

Typical diner food...nothing fancy. Simple and satisfying. Very reasonable prices AND you get your happy face cookie! Lots of parking and conveniently located on University Blvd off the 376 near Robert Morris University."}
{"text":"We have not been out to dinner in a while having 2 kids. We stopped for dinner tonight at EatnPark. We were seated within 5 minutes and that was great. As soon asker waitress came over we ordered our food. It took way too long to get our dinner. The philly steak sandwich was delicious. My buffalo chicken wrap was way too wet with sauce and ranch. So if you order it maybe ask for ranch on the side. My husband got the salad bar and chili was so good he got 2 cups. Then my son ordered the pancakes. He didn't complain but as I was cutting it the edges were hard. Not the worst but we have definitely had better service here. Our waitress was really nice so that was a plus."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday and i just flew in from California. Checked into the room and started driving to look for dinner. After looking for 45 minutes for some decent cheap food. I decided to drop by this place to give it a try. This was the first time i went to this type of restaurant but i guess it's a chain of them. It's probably comparable to a Carrows in the west coast. I ordered meatloaf, a sunday and some salad. All in all it was pretty good and i would'nt mind going back here. They do have alot of different options on the menu that i wound't mind trying."}
{"text":"Go here for breakfast food, smiley cookies, and milk shakes.  There is a very nice waitress who works the late shift if insomnia is your thing.  Definitely try their $3 milk shakes and don't be afraid to combine it with coffee.  Randomly heard a popular indie band from BK on the radio before working out mention 'Eat n Park' in their lyrics... Who was it?  Message me on Yelp you think you know."}
{"text":"Eat n Park is a Pittsburgh staple. They have locations all over the Burgh. Today we stopped in for lunch. I totally went old school and ordered a Tuna Melt with a side of fries. The bread was nicely toasted. The cheese was melty. There was a nice scoop of tuna on each half.   Not 5 star but it met the yearning I had for comfort food. I also ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie. It was quite tasty and the perfect way to end lunch."}
{"text":"Eat n Park is a staple to Pittsburghers. This location is in the parking lot of South Hills Village mall.  It's a great place for large groups or even a table for 2. They have a great menu with salads, sandwiches, entrees, appetizers, and desserts. There is a late night menu and a great salad bar.  It is open all hours which is wonderful. I took a young lady that I mentored to the ballet and then we went to Eat & Park for a late dinner. Most of their wait staff is friendly but it seems that they are always short staffed. It's the same with Bus Boys. 
It's not fancy but it's affordable. It will always be a favorite place for Pittsburghers because they continue the tradition year after year, generation after generation."}
{"text":"I think I agree with a lot of other reviewers when they say that this is basic, good food at a basic, good price. This isn't a place for a fancy date night, but for just dinner as a family, it can't be beat. There is something for everyone, it's yummy food, and they're always awesome with kids. My 4 year old gets SO pumped for her free smiley cookie.  For experiences like that, casual family dining, I appreciate this place. Too many restaurants are leaning away from families. It's nice to see Eat N' Park keep their priorities straight."}
{"text":"I came from out of town visiting PA for a family vacation. I came in welcomed by the nicest girl i have met in a very long time. She had this big smile on her face that was so welcoming and asked how my day was; that made me smile. She said it was her first day and i was so surprised because she did a great job. The cookies are also sooooooo good!!!! I definitely will go back again when i visit Murrysville."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location and probably all of these restaurants. I'm not from the area and I won't be eating at any of these restaurants. I was seated at a four top, I was alone. I had never been there before. I had no idea what to order. I was given a menu and it was more than 5 minutes before a server came over to my table. I ordered a water and asked what was good. I went and looked at the salad bar, very unappetizing. Most of the items were not filled up and wilted looking. The fruit I ordered was at least one day old. I didn't wait to see the server after being there 30 minutes with no contact and no food other than the fruit. I got up and walked out. I ordered an entire meal. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"No wonder my husband never brings us here. Never again. I swear. I'll eat cereal at home instead.  If I were allowed to give zero stars, I would. 

The hostess couldn't find a clean table at which to seat us. That should have been the first clue that we were in trouble.

I passed by the salad bar on my way to our table. They were out of just about everything.  Guess I won't order salad bar. Second clue.

The man at the table next to us was complaining to a manager about waiting. Third clue.

Add to this the fact that the kids at the booth behind us were screaming and telling their parents to shut up. Par for the course at an establishment of this caliber. 

It took 15 minutes for our waitress to even appear. 

We finally got our drinks after 29 minutes at the table. She brought a few of the accessories- cole slaw, some dinner rolls. She walked away with my iced tea though. And we still had no silverware.  That took another 10 minutes. 

40 minutes into my Eat n Park experience and the two tables on my right are still dirty, as is the floor. (See picture)

My son said his chocolate milkshake was pretty good despite the fact that they screwed up and brought it with whipped cream and a cherry after I specifically requested that they leave those off.  

43 minutes and counting. No food yet. Our server,  Lori, just explained something about putting a big tickets for another group through before ours. Whatever. Thanks for trying to make your problems mine.   

They just bussed and cleaned the 2 dirty tables next to me. Not the floor though. Used napkins and straw wrappers and fries and all.

48 minutes. No food. And we're all out of drinks. 

Food arrived after 50 minutes at the table. It was just ok. My Nantucket cod looked like it had been baking under the warmer for a while. (See picture) It was pretty tasty, I will admit. They forgot my mother's garlic bread. 

59 minutes in, the waitress reappeared with one drink refill but none for the rest of our table. We asked about the garlic bread. Hmm. She was surprised we didnt have it and blamed it on the kitchen (but they aren't the ones who bring out our meals....) 

1 HR and 13 minutes. The waitress brought our check and the missing garlic bread.  
I just realized that she never brought my son his french fries at all.

She was nice enough to bring my 2 kids free Smiley cookies even though they are too old for the kids menu. 

At the register,  I asked to speak to the manager.  He apologized up and down. I told him that this was the worst Eat n Park experience I've ever had. I'm not one to complain but I work in a service industry and this was just horrible on every account. He discounted our bill by half. Not completely acceptable but whatever. He tried to tell me that they never get this busy. I kindly explained that, since there was no line waiting to be seated like there is on weekends and this was not during the actual dinner rush (it's 8:10pm) I doubt that what he's saying is true and he needs to get a grip and have a serious conversation with his staff, especially Lori the air headed server. 

Tonight was the last time I will ever eat at the Robinson Twp Eat n Park."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Denny's knockoff I've ever seen. And the food was tolerable at best. At least the coffee was okay. But the breakfast buffet is .. undesirable."}
{"text":"Coming in for a late night dinner after a work outing at a local bar/restaurant that had great beer but outrageously expensive dinners.  Eat N Park is always dependable for a quality meal!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast today.  I had two over easy eggs, bacon, and English muffin. Oh and coffee of course.  The bacon was very crispy but not burnt in the least. I think this might be the best bacon I've ever had at Eat n Park.  The service was also friendly and quick. My coffee cup never got near empty!!"}
{"text":"This week I had to be at work early, so I decided to eat breakfast at enp instead of at home. This location is on my way to work and very close to the freeway on ramp which makes gauging time easy.  I had the oatmeal fruit combo plus an egg over easy, plus coffee of course.  I had heard some enp's use instant oatmeal and others use quick oats.  If that's true, then this particular enp must use instant. Otherwise everything was great.  Although it can take a few minutes for them to notice you walked in the door at 6:30 am, once seated the service is friendly, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"We had a mediocre lunch. I got the chicken sandwich and half the chicken was over cooked.  How is that possible? Oh, the microwave. My companion got one of their new sandwiches - ham and apple.  Nice to try something new but it didn't exactly satisfy.  Coloring our experience were some creepy customers.  I know that's not anything in the control of enp but it will deter me from returning nevertheless."}
{"text":"What a bummer of a breakfast this morning. I was just here last week and it was great.  Today, terrible.  I got the same oatmeal fruit combo as last week.  The only difference is the waitress.  The oatmeal was grainy and looked like she poured boiling water in the bowl and gave it to me. The toast came late, after I was finished with the oatmeal.  Usually the milk comes in a small drinking cup which works for me since I drink it with my toast. This time it came in a serving thing like I am going to pour it in my soupy oatmeal. With the fruit and toast still left to eat she gave me the check and gave the impression she won't be back to refill the coffee.  Well, I won't be back to this enp.

C'mon enp, can we be consistent?"}
{"text":"This is a large, spacious eat n park. I was here for breakfast, and got my usual oatmeal & fruit combo. The fruit cup had bananas which is a nice treat.  The coffee tasted especially good and they kept the cup full. The parking out front is shared with the mall so during breakfast hours there is plenty of spaces. All in all, a very nice experience today."}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers and fries.
Honey bun is awesome
Service is also very good and fast. 
Way better than other fast food chains like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's. 
Actually I don't think it's a fast food restaurant.... They have a nice salad buffet too 
Unfortunately, a Pittsburgh chain ......."}
{"text":"Seeing all those advertisements for the return of Eat'n Parks strawberry pie I found it hard to resist. So I made my way over to pick one up for after diner that night. The girl at the service counter was very friendly and boxed up the delicious looking pie overflowing with huge juicy red strawberries. It was right around  $10.50 so it was a good price. After we ate later that evening we got set to try it with great anticipation on my part. Let me just say that the looks of this pie far exceeded the taste. The berries were large, and tasteless, surrounded by the most aritifical tasting glaze.  Topped with fake whipped cream, and all poured into an underbaked crust. I realize that nearly all purchased desserts are not as good as homemade, but this pie was so disappointing. Still haven't eaten here, but after trying that pie I'm not sure if I ever can. No military discount here."}
{"text":"By far the best club sandwiches around! You can now order online which is very convenient and your order is always ready when you come to pick it up period when ordering online you always get a free smiley cookie which is always a nice touch to a food order. Everyone who works there is super nice and friendly. This is a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This location has really improved since the renovation. Salad bar is always fresh, wait staff is always friendly, food is always hot & the wait usually isn't too long unless you go on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a distant second choice after finding that where we had hoped to dine, the nearby Pasta Too, was so crowded by 5:45 p. m. on Saturday, 15 November 2014, that it was difficult to get in the door.  My wife and I were not going to stand to endure a long wait for a table at a restaurant that does not accept reservations or phone-ahead seating, so we wound up at Pittsburgh's favorite, the old, dependable Eat 'n Park.  There were two individuals serving as hostess: one was delightful, pleasant, and smiling, the other was sullen, providing no greeting or pleasantness, simply saying with a frown, \"How many?\" when we stepped to the stand.

We were seated at a small booth for two, in a cramped part of the restaurant where other parties are just a few feet away across the aisle, not great with an active and loud party directly across from us for most of the meal.  When leaving the table or returning to it from the salad bar, there was so little space to maneuver that we had to be careful not to bump anyone who was standing, including the servers.

Our young male server was pleasant and seemingly well-intentioned, but not available after the first part of the meal, hence water glasses were not refilled and a stack of used plates, including those from the salad bar, remained untouched on our table for most of the meal, this despite a busser passing numerous times to clear the tables of  parties that had left. How can a manager either not be aware that basic bussing duties are not being performed or not care?

The food, including the salad bar, was not bad, not great. I was surprised and pleased to see fresh cauliflower, an expensive item. The potato salad and cole slaw were satisfactory and not overly creamy, which was good. The garlic bread that came with our entrees would be laughed at by a bona fide Italian restaurant.  Nothing here will ever be mistaken for the haute cuisine which is offered by Eat 'n Park at its Six Penn Kitchen division. The best thing I can say is that our dinners were a good value at $9.99 including salad bar and soup that is perhaps a small step up from Campbell's.  I wish Pittsburgh had a fabulous salad buffet restaurant like Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes, which are in business in many other parts of the country.  Eat 'n Park's salad bar will never be compared to it.

We left this dinner rather disappointed."}
{"text":"Eat 'n Park is passable for certain things. The hamburgers are satisfactory and although the salad bar will never be compared to the extraordinary Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes, it is not bad.  My wife and I were desperate for food after a late Pittsburgh Pirates game, which left us few choices, and we made the mistake of coming here and ordering the $9.99 Midnight buffet, which was lousy.  The eggs, fried potatoes, hash browns, onions, and mushrooms drowning in liquid, were tasteless.  Pancakes that are stuck to the container in which they are placed are not likely to please and the soggy waffle my wife had was not enjoyable either. If I had been told that the corned beef hash was canned dog food or that it was made with Spam, it would have been believable as there was no hint of beef as it is known to most people. The quality of the food at Golden Corral is spectacular in comparison to Eat 'n Park and the value is infinitely better, $8.99 for a breakfast buffet that includes an extensive salad selection and so much more well-prepared, well-seasoned, tasty items. Breakfast foods are now served there throughout lunch and dinner.  I do not plan to order the Eat 'n Park Midnight Buffet or the breakfast buffet ever again.  If I do, I will deserve my fate.  I continue to have difficulty understanding why Eat 'n Park is such a spectacular success, particularly given that at its other divisions, including Six Penn Kitchen, it has demonstrated that it knows how to prepare appealing cuisine. I would have been much better off at Primanti Brothers, where one can secure a late night feast: half pound cheeseburger with all the trimmings and which includes enough of the area's best french fries for an army, for a mere $8.19.  This Eat 'n Park location has been nicely remodeled.  It is now more spacious, attractive, and comfortable.  There is not much more  that can be said for it than that."}
{"text":"The reason I give this location a 2 is due to the management/server. My spouse and I eat at the Penn Hills location at least once a week. We have NEVER been approached, by a manager at our table to see how our meals/service are.  Last evening was different. 

We both ordered superburger combos with the salad bar. We went directly after ordering to make our salads and returned to our table. I had not even taken a bite of my salad and our meals arrive and are placed in front of us. I told the server we haven't even taken a bite of our salads and she simply giggled and said \"I know, that was really fast!\" and walked away.  At that moment the manager was picking up menus near our table and I asked to speak to her when she had a moment. We were finished with our meals, our server never came back, and the manager hadn't stopped by so I asked the hostess to speak to the manager. 

She then arrived, didn't apologize, just said she forgot about us, and asked what did we want. Wearing dirty gloves  I might add. I told her our issue with our food arriving just as we sat down to enjoy the salad bar as our hot meals arrive. Needless to say we ate our hot food first and never did eat our salads. I asked to see the manager to point out that the server shouldn't have put pushed our order in so quickly knowing we had ordered the salad bar. The manager was very defensive, did not apologize, made the excuse \"we're trained to put the order in right away and get the food out right away\". She did not care that we wanted to enjoy the salad bar before our dinner and again made no apology. I believe her name was Shamantha.  She doesn't possess the interpersonal skills to be a manager. 

We live in this neighborhood and  we will NOT be returning to your restaurant. You have lost regulars that this location depends on to stay open as they are not in a popular/high traffic area. And we will be sure to tell our friends and neighbors about our experience."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. The only reason this place gets any stars is because of our server. I believe her name was Jess. She was busting her ass after being sat 10 times in a very small time period by a manager that couldn't care less. This caused a long wait which wasn't that big of a deal but still. She was blonde and wasn't wearing a name tag, probably because she knew she was doing a terrible job. She clearly cut all her servers before the post Steelers game rush had happened. I had the chicken sandwich which was meh, they forgot the tomato on it but that's not what made it bad. Someone else in my group had a fish sandwich. Sandwiched between a French roll that may have taken a 6 month boat ride from France to here due to how hard the bread was. We were gonna feed it to the birds but we didn't wanna break any beaks. At the end of our meal it was the lazy manager who was asked if she could close us out due to how busy the server was. We were polite about the situation considering how truly awful our experience was. We told her about the bread and she didn't even ask if she could do anything. I know that they probably deal with shitty complaints from cheap clientele but the issues we had were simply inexcusable for a 30 dollar meal. Jess should go across the street to industry public house or anywhere where they care about hospitality."}
{"text":"Every time I have come to this location I have been disappointed with the service, the food, the cleanliness and/or the wait. I don't understand how their HQ is next door and this location is such a step down from other locations. 

This visit the salad bar was notably missing items, the soups at the salad bar were practically empty and watery. The restroom was dirty. The coffee was stale. And the steak salad ordered off the menu was browned head lettuce with \"steakums\" looking meat. Further, while I was at the salad bar, an employee and presumably a manager were discussing another employee who was always late and not able to effectively do his job and were also complaining about patrons not putting the serving spoons back in an upright position after use. 

I don't think I will come back to this location. The location on Streets Run Rd and Clairton Blvd is the exact opposite of this location. I will take my business there."}
{"text":"I LOVE Eat n Park. I know so many Pittsburghers who bust on this wonderful establishment, and I don't get it, bc E & P is amazing. The salad bar, the milkshakes, the chicken noodle soup.... the grilled stickies a la mode!!! Those are a few of my favorites. They're open 24 hours which is the coolest, and it's super reliable. A hometown chain with fast service and low prices, can't beat that. I've also been told recently that they're pretty into supporting the Pittsburgh economy, sourcing much of their produce and food supplies locally. And can I say that in an era of so much ageism in the workplace, I love that Eat n Park employs many senior employees. A true champion born here in our own fair city."}
{"text":"Once again, this Eat'n Park location is absolutely beautiful.  It might have to do with the fact that the corporate offices used to be located on the second floor, but regardless, this location is beautiful and the staff is quick and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This company represents a honest and caring company that cares about their community.  They operate a variety of businesses and restaurants including the Eat n Park locations, the new Porch in Shenley, Six and Penn Kitchen, and the new upcoming Hello Bistro.  I cannot wait to try all of their dinning places."}
{"text":"Eat n Park always has the homey food that just is always good cooking.  It was a Friday during lent, so I had to be a good boy and order fish.  Luckily ENP just recently came out with a new seafood menu items.  I ordered the Baked Cod Floridian, and it was very good.  It had a strong orangey taste that added different fruity flavoring to the fish.  It was very good, but I wish I had more on the plate.  The filets were very very small, so be warned before you order."}
{"text":"We went about 9:30 10:00 @ night & I had the pot roast sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes and my roommate had the chicken parm with garlic bread and afterwards I had the hommade potato chips and my roommate had a chocolate milkshake. The roast beef was average @ best and the bread tasted oily but the gravy and mashed potatoes were good. The breading on the chicken was burnt and the chicken was rubbery & the garlic bread wasn't toasted. The homade potato chips were OK & my roommate asked for the milkshake to be extra thick & creamy & it was thin."}
{"text":"This is a solid neighborhood staple. This review is more for out of towners. People who visit the area and stop at an eat n park generally love it. It's a solid diner that pittsburgh People are spoiled with. I recommend it after a night of drinking or a cheap brunch with mom."}
{"text":"We all know that Eat n' Park is a Pittsburgh institution, but this Murray Avenue location is definitely the best!  I attended Chatham University several years ago, where my friends and I would walk up in the middle of the night to get some coffee and cheesy fries while smoking a cig in the smoking section!  We would go so often that the 3rd shift staff knew us by name and knew our orders by heart.  All in all, the service is friendly, the food is cheap and satisfying (with plenty of healthy options), and you can't beat that it's 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I know that eat'n park is big around here, but since living here for the past 5 years I just can't wrap my head around it. I'm pretty sure that most of the meals I've ordered through out my time here has been just microwaved and bland. This past time I got the cheese omelet with pepper jack cheese. I like the idea of having some cheese on top of my omelet and inside, but it just ended up being a ball of cheese in the middle by the time I got to it since there was more cheese than egg. The hash browns were really bad. Very dry and unappetizing.  Maybe next time I'll just get the salad bar."}
{"text":"Eat n park is a great place too go to for the quick comfort of american food that's not overly expensive. They have a great salad bar and everything usually taste fresh.

The have a great array of dressing, about 9 or soup along with soup and deli salads like potato, broccoli slaw and macaroni. I like that they offer fruit along with the salad because I always enjoy something sweet to go along with my tangy salads.

Sundays are usually the busiest because of people leaving church and grabbing the brunch buffet before it stops at 2pm. They offer some hot foods like fried chicken, pirogues, stuffing and gravy, mashed potatoes and lots of other good stuff. 

My favorite thing here though besides the food is their strawberry lemonade. I love how sweet and refreshing it is. Although there are no real strawberries i prefer it that way. They tend to get stuck in the straw anyway."}
{"text":"I love Eat 'n Park but something very odd has happened at this location.  A beautiful new restaurant building and in equal measure a downgrade in meal quality. 

The salad bar is always, and I've been there at least a dozen times, is always bare on fruits, cottage cheese, and the soup of the day. Always!  Meals are lower quality. Just had another burned Scrod Maryland. 

Hope someone wants to fix this once great restaurant."}
{"text":"This place just didn't impress me. By no means was I expecting fine dining, but I wasn't expecting downright horrible food either. My cheeseburger was so bad that I didn't even bring the leftovers home for my dog. The meat was like rubber and the patties were so small you had to hunt to find them. My daughter had the chicken fingers and they were definitely a frozen product because they were chewy. The service was just terrible. They had 15 empty tables when we arrived and they couldn't find a place to put a party of 6 and made us wait. Our server was sweet but she was definitely overworked and had too many tables at once to wait on. I feel bad for the staff as you can just tell they aren't treated well. They are overworked and underpaid. Our dishes weren't cleared and we had to wait 15 minutes for our check. My daughter loved the free cookie and loved the coloring paper they provide but that was the only positive."}
{"text":"I love a breakfast at Pittsburgh's  family-owned restaurant chain Eat'n Park. As a teenager this is the place I would go with my friends after every jr high dance, sports game, or any weekend we couldn't find anything better to do. We'd have fried appetizers, milkshakes and grilled stickies. Now I love to go for good, affordable coffee and pancakes on a weekend morning. The Yinzer community is strong here, there's just something so nice and comforting about coming to Eat'n Park and seeing the hard working employees & patrons, their Pittsburgh pride & friendliness is evident.  Their Caramel Macchiato Latte, is definitely full of sugar, but it is so worth the calories for a delicious sweet treat. A bonus on top is that it comes with a free refill, that I usually take to go. My go-to Eat'n Park is the one right in front of the Ross Park Mall (7370 McKnight Rd) the other smaller location down McKnight is very slow. If you're interested, I shared more & pictures on my personal blog at http://moscatoismymantra.com/breakfast-spots-in-north-hills/"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple.  They're so family-friendly, their mascot (see, they have a mascot - totally family friendly) is a smiling cookie.

Most recently, I was here for brunch after church, though I've been coming here for years.  The servers are always friendly, it's usually pretty clean, and the buffet is normally well-stocked.  I love their new, health-conscious approach to their menu; they still have the classics, like the breakfast smile with full fat and grease or the smart breakfast smile, with less fat and grease.  Fresh fruit instead of bacon was actually a refreshing change (and I love me some bacon) and my egg-beater-like egg white substitute really did taste good and egg-y.  My father had the same thing, but the original version.  Those hashbrowns they have are like fried gold - always the first thing that gets eaten.

Our server was always quick with the coffee.  Even though she had other tables, she'd take care of us first so as to allow time to chat with her regulars.  I can appreciate that; it makes you want to be a regular.

Pros: relatively quick service (it's been faster, but it was Sunday), fresh take on the menu, servers take care of the regulars
Cons: this time the food delivery was really lagging (no fault of the server, the kitchen must have been slammed), booths weren't fully clean before we sat down"}
{"text":"They make a nice breakfast for less than the tip form dinner the night before.  That's not bad!"}
{"text":"Love this eat n park location on library road in bethel park! Been going there for years, love the super fast breakfast service! During the weekdays you can get your breakfast fast and it's always cooked right! Waitresses are great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"How do you screw up eggs and bacon?  If you want to find out,  go to Eat -n- Park in Bridgeville. Denny's and Kings are both down the road,  keep going past this Eat -n-Puke and try them instead. Much better.  Service was good."}
{"text":"If you're into microwaved mediocre \"American food\" this is your spot. You can get better chicken tenders at most bowling alleys. I struggled to eat about 40% of my meal. Only because I was starving and it was 11pm. The chicken tenders were about 20% chicken filler and 80% hard breading with a dark color that was probably caused by old oil and the taste was as bad as it looked. The most disappointing part of this experience was the pie, which I originally went there for. It looked as if the waitress threw the pie against the wall and scooped it on a salad plate with a rake before she microwaved it for a minute too long. You're better off making a hungry man in the microwave then going to eat n park. Very very disappointing. They updated their menus and restaurants. But downgraded their actual food. 0-10 would recommend. Snapped a pic at the end when I decided I would warn any would be victims"}
{"text":"I went here around 12:30 AM on January 1, 2011, after New Years' Eve. They had a breakfast buffet laid out.

I'd barely gone to any Eat 'n Parks this past year because my local one (in Edgewood) is horrible, so I was pleasantly surprised that there was nothing wrong here. We were seated quickly, the waiter handled the beverage orders quickly, and the buffet was fine. No problems at all, except when the place got completely packed around 1 AM and we had a bit of trouble tracking down the waiter to get our check... That wasn't a big deal, though.

I can't justify giving more than 3 stars due to the fact that Eat 'n Park isn't exactly fine dining, but we got filling food for minimal hassle, so it was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard breakfast restaurant like Perkins. They offer breakfast all day and the food is not too pricey. I have to say it is nothing too exciting, but it is a solid meal. While in Pittsburgh (from Cincinnati) visiting my brother, we initially went to IHOP (which I was pretty disappointed in because we can go to IHOP anywhere). 

The IHOP was in a brand new development, with a huge parking lot, and a 45 minute wait. Luckily we decided to ditch IHOP and go to Eat n' Park two minutes away. There was no wait; it was not crowded at all, and it was part of a nice business district that reminded me of Northside in Cincinnati (somewhat, though not quite as cool).

I would have liked to go to a truly local restaurant (not a chain) in Pittsburgh for our last meal before leaving, but it was better than IHOP. 

I don't really understand the name though. Shouldn't it be Park n' Eat? Oh well."}
{"text":"My little one was born on Ground Hog day. This year he was *so* excited to pass out the Ground Hog Day Smiley cookies at preschool. However, the day before his birthday they hadn't arrived.  It turned out I had not completed my online order. In a panic I called the Bethel Park Eat n Park and explained my issue. The assistant manager (Olinda?) explained that they did not sell the Ground Hog cookies in store. He agreed to give it a shot and see if it could mix some colors together and do his best. 

I picked them up the day before and they were perfect!  I really appreciated them going above and beyond to save a little boy from disappointment on his birthday."}
{"text":"Perhaps the crowd here is less harsh, because I feel like the location in Squirrel Hill has been consistently better despite having a slightly lower rating. I've only been here three times - twice on a Wednesday night around 5 and once on a Saturday at around noon. From looking at the other pictures, the food doesn't seem so bad, so I might have just been unlucky on the Wednesday evenings, because both times I've ordered, the food was completely unsatisfactory.

The first time, the sesame pork chop was tiny - definitely not worth nearly 10 dollars (I take SOME presentation into account as well, and the food just looked thrown together on the plate). But I had the great salad bar to make up for it, and managed to cram 6 plates of salad because I'm a college student trying to maximize my nutrient to price ratio. And on the plus side, the waiter, Kevin, was very friendly, and even comped my HUGE piece of pumpkin creme pie for no particular reason. I didn't mention anything about the pork chop because I was very satisfied with the salad bar, anyway.

The second time, I ordered the chicken broccoli alfredo, and it was absolutely disgusting. I could see oil droplets on the entire dish (and I understand that alfredo is a creamy, oily dish, but this was ridiculous), the chicken was slightly burnt, and there were THREE pieces of broccoli. In a dish called \"chicken and broccoli alfredo!\" Honestly, I've never sent back food because who knows how chefs would respond, but oh well. On the plus side, the waitress (Aly or Ally I think) was absolutely lovely. A lot of energy, smiles, and attentiveness, so of course, I tipped well.

The place was packed on Saturday at noon, but other than that I had no issues. I'm not sure who cuts the pies though (whether they're already sliced or the waiter/waitress does it quickly), because the carrot cake I had was considerably tinier than the pumpkin creme pie! Perhaps they'd anticipated not having enough?"}
{"text":"Eat'n Park has an above average brunch buffet on Sundays from 11-2. They have a nice little variety to choose from on the buffet (Pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pierogies, chicken, fruit, salad, soup, just to name a few.) The food is pretty average I'd say, but for 10 bucks, it's not a bad deal. I've always had good service every time I've been here.  I've definitely had better brunches before but for the convenience and the cheap price, I'd return in the future."}
{"text":"Composite over the years:  Great parking, easy access from 2 major roads, open, airy, spacious.  Absolutely wonderful desserts, and basic \"family\" food. Bottomless coffee cup of course.  Vinyl in the round benches make for a comfortable arrangement of people; good for small meetings and business.  Several \"rooms\" available depending on customer's inclinations and needs.  Food has always been fresh, heated, and presented well upon arrival at the table.

EnP does a great job of sticking to a well honed formula for customer satisfaction in my view.  Nothing over the top or fancy.  Basic food managed well.

Checkout has always been quick and courteous.

f8 and be there."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast because I wanted to try out places I can't visit in NY, and it's close to the turnpike to get out of Pittsburgh. Its setup is exactly like Bob Evans, which I just experienced for the first time in Ohio on this same trip. Comparing the two, I much prefer Bob Evans. Here, I ordered the super smile-something or another meal that comes with eggs, your choice of breakfast meat, your choice of breakfast potatoes, and an Eat'n Park special called grillees (or something like that). It's basically like rectangular folded Cinnabon bread. Yummy, but very sweet all on its own without the special syrup drizzle. I devoured my meal because I love breakfast foods, but this meal was noticeably greasier than my similar meal at Bob Evans. Also, the hash browns came out in the rectangular, McDonald's like format, while Bob Evans gave me a shredded version. Obviously, I prefer the latter style. The coffee was barely drinkable, and our particular waitress's service was passable. You can tell I'll probably never end up here again. The only reason I might come back is because they offer some kind of buffet option, so if I were hungrier, I might try that out since it'd be a free-for-all of favorite meal choices. If the buffet turns out to be as equally greasy as the a la carte, that'll seal the never-to-return deal."}
{"text":"Affordable & filling meals for families.  This place is super kid-friendly, and also food allergy friendly... with tons of menu options for all appetites.  The waiters and waitresses have always been fantastic here with questions and service."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. 

Service was friendly and food came out quickly. The hashbrowns and sausage looked like the frozen kind but it was still fine. I thought the bananas foster fresh toast was amazing. If I was to come back for brunch, I would make sure to get this because it's delicious. 

If you come here with the expectation it's going to be out of this world food, you'll be disappointed but it's super cheap and pretty filling so I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"How sad. We visit here every Sunday after church while visiting Medina two months a year. My husband had completed two trips to the salad bar and finished while I continued to wait for my breakfast . Was hoping for maybe a grape or two, a couple slices of banana or maybe a strawberry.  Melon cup would be a more accurate description rather than fruit cup.   I guess we need to find some place else for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"God damn it if this isn't the swankiest looking EnP I've ever been to. I had been wanting to come here for years, if only to see if it's as ornate on the inside as it is on the outside.

Eh, no such luck. It looks like an office building as you drive up to it. When you enter, it looks like...another EnP. Hurm. 

EnP's can be befuddling, at least with me. I swear that the food and service is better at some locations than at others. Then again, I've also found that it depends on what you order and when you go. 

Late last night, Kay and I stopped in for supper. 

Ariel, our server, was proficient and chipper, so I won't (nor can one under any circumstances) hold the dry, tasteless BBQ Cheddar Bacon Burger (or whatever they call it) against her. Hey, I hadn't tried it before. Maybe I should have stuck with the Superburger, but as a reviewer, I have a duty, y'know?

Nonetheless, the cole slaw was up to the usual above average standard, and the slice of green pistachio pie (only offered in the month of March) that I shared with Kay was creamy, nutty, Celtic (?) satisfaction."}
{"text":"I know, it's Eat 'N Park, but Iron Man 2 ran late. Where else to go late on a Saturday night? Unless you like to dine with blitzed yahoos of course.

Some people are into that. I didn't feel like it tonight. LOUD movie. 

Anyway, of all the Eat 'N Parks I've been to, this one is the absolute best in terms of service. If you must go to an E 'N P, come here. 

The food?

For a chain it ain't bad. I usually get a burger. The Superburger is a gourmet Big Mac. I prefer the Black Angus Burger.

Yay! They brought back the Cookie Fudge Fantasy which evokes Gullifty's (haven't been there in a decade.5) Colossal Cookie For Two (I think that's what it's called). I always have to get ice cream when I go to Eat N Park. 

It's an old stand-by. What else can you say?"}
{"text":"This Eat 'N Park is in Bellevue, and if you're headed out of the city on Route 65, this will be the first of 2 E 'N P's you'll ride past, the second one being in Sewickley. 

The whistle blew, and the one in Sewickley pinned the one in Bellevue after a few minutes of grappling. 

When we arrived around 11PM after a Friday night Maylene and the Sons of Disaster gig at Mr. Smalls in Millvale, the place was bustling (infested?) with suburban teenagers, most of whom apparently came from a dance based on their attire. 

One observation: All too many teenagers these days do not know how to wear dress clothes. Boys had their shirts unbuttoned and belts undone. Girls wearing short party dresses squatted, did splits, high kicks, and at times sat like boys or like Buddha...on the floor. 

Another observation: All too many teenagers don't have basic manners. They play with their food, flick it at each other, compare dishes they order to various bodily fluids and seemingly order food just so they can find new ways to gross each other out. 

Yet another observation: Despite their tacky, lewd behavior, the teenagers mentioned above seem to think they are superior to everyone else and glance in disdain at anyone they don't know. 

One more fricking observation: These teens don't believe in tipping. 

And these are the suburban kids, the so-called \"good\" kids, the ones put onto pedestals for reasons borne of racism and classism. 

Enough social commentary. Katherine, our server, was hilarious, uberefficient, and psychic for she predicted my choice of dessert in the Molten Lava Cake, something I bagged on at another E 'N P but found to be better here. The cake itself tasted fresher than the one I had elsewhere. 

Man, that Mile High Meatloaf looked appetizing but fell like the Tower of Babel before my mother's own meatloaf, the benchmark if you will. Drowning in a flavorless gravy, the meatloaf came with a scoop of high school cafeteria-grade mashed potatoes (they'd been sitting around in a pan for a while) and some onion rings as a garnish. 

I eat my mom's meatloaf with nothing else but ketchup. It's moist on the inside and crusty on the outside; it is perfection. 

Oy, enough with the Wedding Crashers references."}
{"text":"Eat 'n Park is one sneaky chain. 

They like to create new items on their menus (at times only for specific locations) only to pull them away before I can craft a review. 

For instance, an errand brought Kay and I to the Waterfront for brunch early one wet, dismal afternoon, and on the bill of fare were two dishes that apparently are no longer offered: The Hefty Ham Sandwich and The Caramel Apple Pancakes. The former was my entree, and the latter was dessert of course. Yinz know how I trundle. 

The sandwich was a classic of economy and restraint. 

I know you could make it at home, numb-butts, but it's always better when someone else does it. Besides, the Superburger's gettin' old, and taking risks at Eat 'n Park is like playing football in a mine field. We'll not discuss their meatloaf, please. 

Narrow flaps of a juicy, full-bodied ham fit for an employer's X-Mas bonuses are carefully, artfully placed within a chewy toasted Bavarian pretzel bun. Broiled cheddar cheese tops it. Spicy brown mustard compliments (condiments?) it. I asked for mayo as well since it's essential to my being, and I'm quirky like that. Warm, dripping, elementary comforts were had. 

Did Eat 'n Park do something to its cole slaw? It  has more...color now, and it tastes somewhat better than it used to (think tangy). Regardless, I chose it instead of fries since EnP's tend to underwhelm me. 

On the flip side, I was overwhelmed by the Caramel Apple Pancakes, almost. I shirked the complimentary bacon (or sausage if you prefer) onto Kay so as to battle this beast uno en uno. Two signature EnP pancakes are topped with warm cinnamon apples, streusel, candied pecans, caramel. 

If you have this as a main, you're on your way to join Wliford Brimley, cousin. 

This was apple pie meets a cinnamon roll meets a bag of candy corn. The flapjacks were airier than a daytime talk show and frankly would have been dull with just syrup and butter coating them (I never order regular breakfast items at EnP). It was the humid fruit, the crunchy nuts, and the sinfully sugary white and brown icings that made this a treat, eclipsing anything on the dessert section f the card in a rare triumph. 

For a chain, Eat 'n Park can be one helluva lark. Why do to you go to Denny's again? Tell me, real quick.

P.S. I have nothing bad to say about the service. Kay and I were treated professionally and not without a smile.

P.P.S. As I've mentioned in another EnP review, try the bearclaw if you're sick of having pies and sundaes (even if they are pretty good) after your meal. It will be served hot with butter slathered all over it. If you are to die that day..."}
{"text":"Their grilled chicken salad tasted awful good with ranch dressing late Saturday night and therefore granted me respite after an epic, trying day of adventure and misadventure. Eat 'n Park rarely lets me down. The Smiley Cookie is a beacon during the twilight hours, acting as a guardian spirit for lost souls like you and me, providing sanctuary as well as decent food at a decent price."}
{"text":"The lady and I had been overdue for a Park 'n Eat or, I'm sorry, Eat 'n Park for a spell or two, so since we were in Bridgeville (we've been out this way a bunch recently for some reason), we felt it gave us an opportunity to try a few of their newer menu items at a different location. 

Opening our dinner was a serving of their Fresh Chips and Dip. You've got that right. Captain Smiley has taken a cue from other eateries and is now serving ideal, housemade potato chips with a fine ranch dressing (also housemade). Oily, crispy, and somewhat soft within, they almost have a consistency akin to french fries. In fact, I'm preferring these over E 'n P's fries, and they can also be had as a side. Bonus!

Beware the Over Easy Cheeseburger. Remember the term \"over easy\" lest yolk spill all over the table upon first chomp. Such is what happened to your hero. Thankfully our excellent server took it as part of her eventful day and joked with us about it as I finished off the delectable 6 ounce Black Angus patty that hid inside a fluffy seed-encrusted Kaiser roll. 

\"Next time, it's over hard for you, buddy,\" she said to me with a wink and a grin. 

A cup of runny but welcome chili complimented my burger with its savory broth, ample ground beef and minimal beanage. 

During another stab at this franchise, I found that I wasn't as crazy about the Fried Pickles as Kay was (it's a Southern thing, and I don't fully understand), but dagnabbit if E 'n P is taking a cue from Burgatory with their Salted Caramel Milkshake. Too cutting-edge to be allowed in a safe family chain, I relished its whipped cream mound, its pink salt, its caramel drizzle, and of course its ivory vanilla ice cream base. 

A breakfast jaunt resulted in a dance with their Italian Breakfast Club. Seasoned and scrambled egg makes up the bulk of the sandwich, while locally procured capicola, tomato, and pepper jack cheese fills it out between two cuts of buttery sourdough toast. Add some of their brilliant fresh fruit salad as a side, and you will  vanquish all foes that morning...or cure a hangover...

Wanting a diversion from the usual Grilled Stickies (recommended, by the way, if you've yet to taste them), I instead ordered a bearclaw. Massive, warmed over, topped with a bone-white glaze, and floating in melted butter, its walnut garnish provided textural contrast to the thick, gooey, doughy, honeyed, cinnamon-laden interiors. Growl...

No matter the hour, be it the light of dawn or after dark, Eat 'n Park is there for you."}
{"text":"It was an Eat 'N Park weekend. As a 24/7 chain, it's as sturdy as a walking stick and more affordable than X-Mas decorations in March. Kudos go out to our server Hudson. I predict (guess?) that he'll become a famous author someday based solely (superficially?) on his first name. Hopefully, his last name isn't Hawk. That would be tragic. 

For some reason this E 'N P's lemonade was different from the lemonade I had at the one in Monaca the night before. This lemonade had pulp in it. Hmmmm...

The Buffalo Chicken Wrap (I got mine with Ranch dressing) is a rather spiffy sandwich. It's tangy of course, due not only to the sauce but also the cheddar. The chicken is thankfully tender. What else to say about it? Oh yeah, there's lettuce and tomato too. Who didn't know that? 

Apple pie a la mode; dependable as a Ford pick-up truck, and Eat 'N Park does it more than capably. No wonder people take home whole pies. 

When nothing else is open, Eat 'N Park is there for ya, and usually the food ain't bad. 

P.S. I am shocked that this Eat 'N Park remained UnYelped until now!"}
{"text":"The service at this rather Expansive 'n  Posh Eat 'n Park near South Hills Village has shown a marked improvement since my last visit. Our server was light on her feet and missed not a single beat. 

Let me introduce you to BAAGB, the Black Angus American American Grill Burger. 

He's got a weighty patty between two cuts of Texas Toast. Onions for days, green peppers for miles, mushrooms, 'Murikan cheese, and mustard to keep him from being too soft on the palate. He's mean. He's a patriot. He's juicy. He's Sargent Slaughter reincarnated as a sandwich, and he gets on well with EnP's fresh, crispy cole slaw, and those newfangled potato chips 'n ranch I can't get enough of.

Winding down lunch after our matinee munch-fest was a classic hot fudge sundae. There's something about EnP's whipped cream and vanilla ice cream; it's thicker and richer than most. And that hot fudge just seeps to the bottom of the glass, begging to be lifted out with that long crane of a spoon. 

Eat 'n Park: American as apple crisp, dissent, and rock 'n roll...

{"text":"I'm from this area but moved to California a few year ago.
(I am am the Executive Chef for an international consulting company I deal restaurant service everyday.)
Every time I come home I go to this Eat & Park to eat with my family. Because we don't have them in LA.
Tonight we went there to eat, 
we were sat and no one came to our table.
After 15 minutes I got up and asked a server is someone serving us she said they were busy and our server was making milkshakes for another table, she was in the sever station talking to another employee.
She grabbed us some silverware and walk us to our table.
After about 5 more minutes we decided to leave (my grandkids were very hungry) we stopped and asked the cashier Peter if there was a manger on duty he said with a smart tone she's in the back I asked him can you get her,
He says for What?
Another customer was asking who his server was and he rattle off 2 names and says in a smart tone it depends where you sitting.
My daughter had asked for cookies for the kids so they could eat something on our way to another restaurant.
The manager took so long we were about to leave. The manager came out and started washing her hands. She is in our view asking who wants to see her, he looks at her and says I don't know,  them over there but they leaving anyway.
Now calmly and quietly I tell her about how bad the service was. and how rude he's was being.
He is ringing someone up and starts talking about us in our face. He says If I'm so rude why did I give them free cookies
My daughter starts talking to the manager he starts saying smart stuff to my daughter, the manager is shushing him
Now I'm pissed we walk out.
I starr talking to another guess who was upset about her service and she said I saw you guys come in awhile ago,
What? I can't believe You guys sat there all that time and not get severed.
I calmed down and go back in and ask the same guy Peter to get his manager again.
He walks in the back and never comes back for almost 10 minutes. I go to the server station and ask another person the get the manager. She comes out I tell her I just want his name.
She gives me his name and starts  to apologising for the poor service and his behavior. And gave us a gift card.
I'm writing this sitting in Apple B's
About to have dinner
Eat & Park Edgewood Town center Pittsburgh pa. I'll never go back
I'll use the gift card at a different location for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great Remodel!  Place looks fantastic.

Great Service!   Waitress was on her game and seemed to know the name of some of the people at the other tables.

Good food.  The Buffalo chicken salad was good and the honey buns are delicious.

My associate had eggs and bacon and said \"the eggs were perfect and you could  tell they were fresh, not out of a box\".   Later our waitress confirmed that and went on to explain how they work with local farmers to make everything as fresh as possible.  The rolls from the bakery were fresh and good.   Enjoyed the coffee, too!

For the price it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Yay, I had a really good breakfast with great service. Not fancy but a good Easter Breakfast/Brunch.  One of the smaller locations but it is clean and service was great.  Was thinking omelette but the Grilled Stickies Smile caught my eye or stomach.  It was really good, homemade grilled stickies topped with a honey sauce, two eggs cooked perfectly and 3 slices of tasty bacon...so delicious!

My cup was refilled many times and the waiter was really nice and made a few suggestions to some in the party!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the new spiffy EnP.  Very nice new building with a drive up window.  
We came for breakfast and I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine.  Delicious!  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly.  The hollandaise was tasty and seasoned.  The bacon, spinach and English muffin were a winning combination."}
{"text":"Had a great family meal.  Nice part is that you can order breakfast at dinner time.   In our group we had breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We were farthest table from kitchen which is not always good but service was very good.  Food was good, had the Buffalo chicken salad and it was tasty and fresh lettuce and tomatoes.  It was nice that we actually had some time to sit and talk between ordering and had a good time.  

If you want fast food, you can call ahead and order and pick up at the drive in window.  What  good idea!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and efficient staff, especially for drive thru window. Order is usually ready sooner than quoted time."}
{"text":"Great consisent place. Love coming here"}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good, however the service is almost ALWAYS very VERY slow. Most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. Although they still technically do their job, you can FEEL very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. It's a hit and miss. Unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. The low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant."}
{"text":"Came to Eat Park today expecting to have a good experience haven't been here in a long time wanted something different I got something different all right food that was half cooked broccoli that was rotten a server they had no clue what she was doing she had her head in the clouds obviously or didn't just even know what she needed to do my sons onion rings were half cooked I ordered liver and onions and needless to say they do not know how to do liver or onions asked for some Gravy to put over The liver and onions 25 minutes later still no gravy try to get the server to come over she was taking everybody else's order that's fine but it would've took her two seconds to go back there and grab a cup of gravy so I could've ate my meal because the liver and onions was so disgusting I need something to cover it up because I was at that hungry needless to say I eat liver and onions and I know what they're supposed to taste like they do not know what they're doing with them here I guess if you're going to come to Eat Park come at breakfast time because if you don't you're going to get crap food"}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner her the other night.
I had the cod with mashed potatoes and gravy and they have a huge salad bar.
The cod was delicious and the salad/soup/fruit bar was really great.
I could of come for just the salad bar and would of been completely happy.
The service was great and it was fast and friendly.
The place is pretty big and was very clean.
If in the area I do recommend Eat'n Park as the food and service are both really good."}

Eat'n Park is a pretty big chain in the Pittsburg area.
This was the 2nd one I have been too and I have not been disappointed yet.
If in the area I do recommend Eat'n Park as the food and service are both really good."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to this eat n park and we both ordered chicken caesar salads to go. We sat and drank beverages (me a water and her a chocolate milk) while we waited for our food. 

The restaurant was not busy but we ended up waiting over 40 minutes and realized we still haven't gotten our food. We went to the front of the restaurant to the counter because our waitress was nowhere in sight and said we've been waiting for 40 minutes and haven't seen our waitress since we got our drinks. 

The girl went to the back to see what was taking so long. When she came back we were told that the waitress was currently in the kitchen preparing our food. We then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes while another waitress complained about us loud enough for my mother and I to hear. We walked out of the restaurant after waiting almost an hour for food we never received."}
{"text":"It's not often that I give five stars because of service, but our server, Lori D., earned this normally \"okay\" restaurant five stars. 

The breakfast food was very good. Everything was hot and tasty, but again, the attentive and knowledgable server is what stood out. 

Typically, I only come to Eat'n Park for coffee and dessert, but now I will definitely stop in for breakfast again. In Lori's section, of course."}
{"text":"Had breakfast and dinner there a couple of times. Its your traditional Eatn Park and the food is good especial the Superburgers. Breakfast has a wide variety of choices including breakfast bar. Good food and quick service. Friendly and helpful waitresses. Everyone smiles.... an oldie but still a goodie... :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely a 3 star type of place. Our experience was more like 2 stars though. The  food was exceptionally good. Better than I remembered it. What you order and end up getting looks exactly like the photo on the menu, in a good way (unlike Denny's where the menu looks WAY better than anything you will get from their kitchen.) Our server was acting very strange and really awkward. We felt that the service was very rushed and unfriendly. Protip: do not walk away from a table of people when they're talking to you. And walking ten steps backward while talking to us, not looking where you're going? Annoying and awkward. What would have been a 4 star experience was tainted by this guy's.....lack of experience, if you will. Meh. That aside, like I said, the food ROCKED. For the price, quality was pretty dang good and I don't say that often about diner-esque food. 

I wanted to try their pie selection but the weird server assumed that just because I ordered off the low calorie menu that neither of us wanted dessert. Oh well. His loss (on tip.) Damn, that choco pie looked good. Mmmmmm. I may have eaten healthy for my entree but I am a fatty at heart. BRING ON TEH PIE!"}
{"text":"Much like every other Eat 'n Park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food), except the last five times I've been here, the service has been damn, damn, daaaaaaaamn slow.  It's always fun to see the staff smoking out back while I've waited an hour for some scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"The absolutely average regional chain diner.

If you're looking for no frills, few gimmicks, low cost, friendly service, and comfort food, this is the absolute best out there.

I'm a fan of the Breakfast Smile, which is two eggs, two pieces of bacon, two pieces of toast, and home fries, hash browns, or grits.

Family friendly, teenager friendly, senior citizen friendly.  Drunk friendly on the graveyard shift, as well.  Nonsmoking."}
{"text":"Great place late at night if you are hungry. Staff was very friendly and a great place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"Food is not consistent. Definitely hit or miss.  Salad bar is descent but is not always kept up well. Service has always been good in our experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Eat n' Park many times as well as a few other ones.  I always get the salad bar and possibly something with it.  The food is fairly typical for ENP.

However, the service and salad bar at this particular ENP is usually sub-par: long wait times once seated, unfilled ketchup bottles, missing ice tea spoons, sad looking items on the salad bar, missing items on the salad bar (filling space with whole oranges doesn't count!), burned soups, etc.

If it wasn't for the existence of a salad bar and the location, I'd go to Denny's."}
{"text":"I can not believe the awful experience we had at  Eat n park on route 8 and Saxonburg today.  First we wait 10 minutes at our table and My wife has to ask for a waitress and then my wife over hears the waitress  (Amy)calling her a liar!  We should have walked out then.  But we ordered food and 30 minutes later still don't have it.   Can't get coffee or water refill.  The manager (Sam) was a joke.  Like offering us free food that never showed up  in the first place makes up for calling my wife a liar and the worst service we ever had. Last time ever going there. #eatnparknomore"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten a regular meal at Eat'n Park in a long time but it has long been my go to for both the breakfast and/or lunchtime buffets. Nothing says comfort food like an Eat'n Park buffet! Also, no matter how busy it gets, I've always had fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a higher rating, but a few things knock it down.  First, although most of the place looks clean, I noticed a lack of urgency in bussing tables when it's not busy at all late at night.  Second, they seem to be out of basic stuff like onions and other things (a big step down on the burger).  And, the \"super burger\" isn't that super: two thin patties, and three slices of bun bread.  Nothing special, and it's too pricy for what it is.  I doubt it's better in general than Denny's.  Also, no longer 24 hours (the main reason to go here)."}
{"text":"So, the Eat N Park company decided to renovate the Squirrel Hill shop.  They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the place look hip and trendy, with high tables and chairs, garage door windows to allow for opening and closing during the nicer seasons to 'open air' the place. They spent money on new art that shows the neighborhood. The gave the facade a facelift with stone and paint, and cut the place in half to create another bistroid on what used to be the left side of the seating area. 

Everything is new. New counters and display cases, new carpeting, regular chairs and tables, and upholstered booths. New lighting fixtures. There's even a TV for - well - yet MORE sports coverage in da burgh.

On the wall between the restrooms is a huge banner boasting of how much money they've given to local charities annually. If I recall correctly, the amount was around $2 Million.

So they have money to spend on new restaurants, like Porch, an overstated atmospheric case of overpriced mediocrity, and whatever this new bistroid is that's next to the old but new Eat N Park. They have money to renovate the Eat N Park into an apparent trendy high end diner. They have enough money to donate $2 Million to charity.

But dear Eat N Park...what about the FOOD?

Generally, the only reason my friend and I go to Eat N Park is to grab the breakfast buffet before an afternoon of movies.  Which we did this morning, and what did we find?

A big fancy renovation - with the same ol' crappy food.

Scrambled eggs out of a carton that would make a World War II military man feel right at home. Rubbery pancakes. The same out-of-a-can cheese sauce for whatever you wanted to ladle it over. The same flavorless sausage gravy for dried out biscuits. Sausage greasy enough to lube your 1957 Buick. And they can't even be bothered with the little potato pancakes that used to actually be kind of yummy. One the first trip to the buffet, they had maybe six potato-pancake-like chunks left in the pan, and when we came back for more, they'd switched to regular hash browns patties that had been cut into squares. Same ol' dry mini-muffins. Same ol' canned fruit. Even the 'sauteed' mushrooms were nearly raw and dry, barely cooked at all, let alone 'sauteed'.

I found humor in the fact that they now try to sell their own bags of coffee along with the smiley cookies in the dessert counter, when the coffee that comes to the table is pretty much brown water, that my friend and I refer to as 'tea-fee'.

Eat N Park is (correct me if I'm wrong) SUPPOSED to be a 'restaurant'.  And in my opinion, a restaurant should be know for its...well...FOOD.

Now I have learned, especially as decades passed and corners were cut for profits (which they are apparently making, considering the new bistroids, the renovations, and the charity work) NOT to expect much in the way of 'food' from an Eat N Park. They didn't nick-name it 'Eat N Puke' for nothing. 

However, like most corporate entities in our country today...if you're going to show off and brag about your 'profits', it had BETTER be reflected in your product! 

You may have given the visuals a stunning make-over. And yeah, it's pretty. However, in the rejuvenation of your brand and your product, it's another epic FAIL.

Because in the end (literally) it's the same garbage you've been passing off as 'food' for the last twenty years. The only thing the facelift has inspired is perhaps the change of the apt nick-name...from Eat N Puke...to maybe 'Masticate N Regurgitate'.

Serioulsy? It's too expensive to crack actual eggs, mix in some milk and whip them to make scrambled eggs? It's too expensive to throw potatoes in a food processor with some eggs, flour and seasonings to make your own potato pancakes?

But we can afford a real stone facade, and $2 Million to charity.

Hmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Was SOOOO excited to come back to my favorite childhood staple from when I grew up.  For the most part, it lived up to expectations and was just as I remembered.  Sure, it's nothing super spectacular, but it's pretty  decent and a very affordable meal.

My only complaint is now the salad bar is not just open to order as a side at all times and from what I remember when I was little, you could always get the soup and salad bar as one of your sides.  That was back in 2006 though and also younger me could be wrong.  Either way though, I do think that on weekends especially the salad bar should be an option as a side all day long.  It makes no sense any other way.

But of course, my true love remains with their smiley cookies.  I was so bummed when I didn't see pre-packaged dozens to take home, so I asked if I would be able to get a dozen in some way.  Well, I lucked out because I got to take home a dozen of FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES! And that was all I truly wanted and needed from this visit.  If you've never had a smiley cookie, you need to try them.  They are available online and ship throughout the US so go order them :)

Eat'n Park is still a staple of my childhood and I hope to be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"So I lost my juul here and I know that for a fact. I looked around and didn't see it. Then I went and asked if anyone had seen it or turned it in. They said no but they definitely stole it. I'm never coming back here ever again. Fuck you."}
{"text":"My new friends I met in Pittsburgh took me here for a late after bar breakfast. I've never heard or dined at this chain-restaurant. It is 24-7 place. I ordered the Grilled Stickies since that is their trade-mark food. It is like a French-Toast stick, but with other flavors and fillings. It was delicious. The meal came with eggs and bacon. It cost about $6. Not bad at all for a great amount of food. 

The interior was cute, clean, different, causal, and I loved the smiles all around. This place will make you smile. The restroom was clean as well. My friends enjoyed their meal and everyone was pleased.

The only downfall I had, was only waitress was not very attentive to us. I don't know if she was better with her other tasks or on a smoke break. She was nice and friendly, but not around when you needed her. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this place. The menu offers a large variety of tasteful treats and meals. I wish I could go back to Pittsburgh for this chain-restaurant to try more of their food options. Worth trying out in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'd go more 2.5 than 3, but I'm rounding up as I don't have anything really critical to cut it down for. My first impression: Denny's meets Perkins and had a baby. The menu is very Denny's-esque. The quantity and quality is also on par with Denny's. The primary difference is that Eat has a breakfast buffet (ick I despise breakfast buffets) with people shoving their faces with mediocre food. Also, Eat has a bakery part similar to a Perkins. The staff at Eat was very friendly, so   Kudos for that.  I had never been to an Eat and would not likely go back unless coerced by friends or family. Nothing special, and I left still hungry. The whole wheat pancakes were okay and they did have healthy options (turkey sausage and egg whites), and they also post calories on the menu which makes the calorie counter in me very happy."}
{"text":"My husband met a couple moms at the park who recommended this place to us, as new residents of Pittsburgh from California. After eating there, I'm not entirely sure of why.

We thought we were going to a buffet. Great! We love the occasional buffet! When we arrived and saw exactly what we were working with we were a little confused and disappointed but still decided to stay and try it since it came highly recommended by a couple locals. I ordered the Reuben with the salad bar as my side, my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the salad bar as HIS side, and we got the toddler blueberry pancakes with lots of extra turkey sausage. 

The salad bar is actually really good! lol. I had two full plates of salad before I had to push my plate away so I could leave room for my sandwich. My husband enjoyed the salad bar less so, but I have a soft spot for salad bars so whatever. The Reuben was better than I was expecting: piping hot with lots of meat- a solid effort for a diner chain. My husband had no complaints about his sandwich and my son put as big a dent in his food as he is capable of.

Overall, the experience was just decent. A solid three stars, but in a positive light. I can see this being somewhere I'd drunkenly stumble into back in the days way before the toddler but I can't see myself making special trips here as someone who needs the food I pay for when I eat out to be worth every penny I spend. Nothing bad to say about this location, per se, just nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"I love Eat 'n Park.  I grew up eating there, and even though I live in California now, I will ALWAYS love Eat 'n Park above some place like Coco's.  This location is where I always go with my family after flying into town.  It feels warm and homey and the food seems to have improved even from the past.  I like the updated menu-- They now have a \"Smaller Portions\" section, understanding that people might not necessarily be Seniors yet still want a tasty meal at a manageable size.

I got the Rosemary Chicken.  It seemed kind of buttery, as did the rice pilaf and vegetable sides, but not overly so.  I just told myself, \"The menu says it's lower calorie because it's a smaller portion, and dammit, I'm hungry,\" so I finished it off, cleaning my plate.  I was very satisfied.  My fiance couldn't stop raving about the fluffiness of their Smiley waffle.

The girl at the front behind the register had a very bright, upbeat, friendly personality and we chatted about the good old Smiley Cookies and our childhood memories of them.  Speaking of the Smiley Cookies, for some odd reason whoever decorated the cookies here chose to put the nose up high almost between the eyes.  No!  The nose should be a large dot in the center of the face!  Please remain true to the spirit of the Eat 'n' Park Smiley Cookie. :-)"}
{"text":"Was just in. Had a shitty experience with our waitress. It was clear she didn't give a shit. She couldn't tell us what kind of hot tea she serves and replied with \"I don't know I don't like tea\" an was MIA after the appetizers. I still over tipped her because I know what it's like to have a long day and not want to deal with shit, but I also don't want to feel irritating for wanting dinner after a long days work."}
{"text":"Soup and salad bar for lunch, can't beat it. Lots of salad fixings and I love the mini muffins, yummy! Our waitress was busy but served us well. She was great! Nice, clean restaurant with yummy  food, and a Pittsburgh tradition. Gotta love a smiley cookie! :)"}
{"text":"Although I eat here on multiple occasions because it is one of the only places to go in town for breakfast lunch and dinner, I feel the quality of food has gone extremely downhill over the years. The Sunday brunch used to be something I looked forward to...now it is just a disappoinment. They run out of certain items constantly on the buffet, and it takes forever for somebody to fill it back up. More often than not, they are out of plates or bowls as well. The soup is the main reason I keep coming here because it is always good, no matter what."}
{"text":"Ask anyone who knows me what my most favorite food is and they'll tell you, \"gluten free super burger from eat'n park.\" They're just so good! I am leaving a high rating for this location because so far it is the ONLY Eat'n Park location I've been to in Pittsburgh that my food hasn't come out with a hair in it! I've only ever had to wait here once and it was on Black Friday so that's to be expected. Will always be a customer here!"}
{"text":"i used to come here a lot when i lived in pittsburgh. it's like a lot of other diner's, very similar to denny's, but who else makes smiley face cookies??? i would go just for the cookie. it's good for a quick meal, or a late night place to chill and grab some food."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Clean and open late at night in the burbs.  I had the pot roast sandwich.  Let me tell you, half a sandwich in this place is toooooooo small.  I had to order a second meal.  Then again, I was starving."}
{"text":"I love the new restaurant after the renovation and the pick up window is awesome. The staff seems to be more motivated to make the customers happy. Well, most of them .. Grandma, you know who you are. Anyway, food is always good and prices fair. Good place to grab soup, salad, and a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for a time out from the busy sight seeing around Pittsburgh's Organized labor history. 
This place is great for family gatherings and groups, we were a group of about forty plus people and they accommodated a room in the back for us, great waiting stuff and great food at a very reasonable price. Shout out to the great USW Leadership Scholarship Program for finding this place."}
{"text":"Like any other Eat-n-Park.  A great local diner chain, with much better food than the nationals.  Signs say the food is sourced from local farmers in the Summer.  A good thing, because Western PA grows some of the finest produce in the country."}
{"text":"We've been to this Eat N Park several times and have always had a pretty good experience.  I love the soup and salad bar.  The wait staff is generally really friendly and nice to my children."}
{"text":"I had the whale fish sandwich with the salad bar it was alright the dinner cost $10.99 which I guess wasn't to bad because the salad bar was nice. I do like there soups and the service was good. There's just something about Eat'n parks that I only want to eat there when I have too."}
{"text":"Ordered their super burger special with fries & a drink for pick-up. My food was done on time & still hot. When I called to order the lady I spoke to was very polite, great customer service! I enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Well they are back. They had a \"soft\" opening today for guests. I'm not sure how I was included in the list but I got in on it. We could bring a guest or two and have a complimentary meal.

The staff was indeed very warm and friendly. The decor is nicely laid out with various pictures of South Park around. The salad bar sits just beyond the counter but they have free WiFi and a drive through take out area.

Although I was told they had a new menu it was basically the same things that I have seen before. The food is the same. The salad bar looked pretty much the same as in the old building that had closed. The official reopening is Nov. 19th for this location and you can sign up for offers using your e-mail or download their app.

I normally don't order a full meal but hey when it's on the house why not? They were accepting donations for a children's charity which i gave as a thank you."}
{"text":"We recently had an event here so I was glad for the opportunity to return to have dinner with family and friends. The fall menu is now out so the offerings I had at the event are no longer available. They are now serving turkey with all the trimmings.

Service is always fast and the staff are the nicest ones to work with. This one has also been remodeled to include a take out window. The usual menu items are available as well as their renown soup and salad bar. My turkey dinner came with stuffing, gravy, and a side of my choice. It was very good. Pumpkin pie and cake is now in season so make the most of it while you have the opportunity. A person in our group had the rosemary chicken which is another one of my favorites and it did not disappoint. 

This Eat n Park has the new check service. You don't have to take your check to the pay area. Prices are very reasonable and you can get a good meal or sandwich or whatever you are interested in. They do change the daily soup menu but they always have chili and chicken noodle soup on the salad bar. It's right off an exit at Banksville Road headed away from the city.

Definitely the place for smiles!"}
{"text":"One has to realize that Eat'n Park is a chain. So whenever you go to one everything is the same as any of their other restaurants. I stopped here for lunch since they are remodeling the one I normally go to after a workout.

I'm visiting a lot because they have my special strawberry salad available.Next month it will be off the menu until next summer. Service is friendly and usually fast. Please note it does get crowded but wait times are not too bad.

They have a descent salad bar and will attend it if you notice anything wrong with it. You can have it as a meal or combine it with an entree for a slight up charge. Food is mediocre. Most menu items are ala carte but some come with one side. Dinners normally come with two sides.

They do sell \"smiley\" cookies and merchandise. They do give calorie and gluten free information on their menu.

Their prices are on par with your average chain. Nothing special. Again they have had menu items which they run for a season which are good but don't bring back. It is a good place to meet up with friends or family."}
{"text":"Ok, as I noted I am reviewing this place again. Seems as though every time they change the menu my favorites are gone and I end up paying more money for stuff that doesn't appeal to me.

Say goodbye to the turkey on a pretzel bun. That was one of my favorites. Now the burgers are grouped. You can even pick one with your choice of toppings and cheese including the famous garden burger. I liked that burger with lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard but now you have to \"settle\" for one of their toppings. They will take the cheese off if you don't want it but that doesn't lessen the price.

Service is still good but now the menu looks so lackluster that I may have to just settle for the salad bar when I go in and even that may not always be the greatest.

I just wish places like this will learn to keep what has been a good sandwich or entree and stick with it. I may not be visiting this place much longer."}
{"text":"The staff are always super friendly. I've been here a couple times and Lamar and Lori have been our servers and they sure keep you smiling! They know how to joke around with you and are attentive when you need more to drink. The food is only okay though. One of the times I went I got the super griddle and the waffle just tasted like plain batter, but in a chalky way. This time I got the steak salad and it was huge! It comes with fries, cucumbers, and tomatoes in it with garlic bread on the side. The steak was like shredded rather than pieces of a slab like I originally thought. It was good with ranch dressing."}
{"text":"First off the staff are really friendly and come around to make sure your coffee and water cups are full. But the reason why my rating is only 3 stars is because of the food. The smiley waffle tastes like batter in the worst way possible. Then the sausage is rubbery and the potatoes are greasy. The only redeeming entree is the all American scrambler. This is a place for cheap breakfast, but go somewhere else if you want decent food."}
{"text":"If you must eat at Eat N Park, this is the one you want to go to. Why you ask? The corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day, breakfast lunch and dinner. 

When I spend a few hours with dear old mom, she enjoyed spending a day at the Waterfront, she loved the since closed 39 center store, where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for 39 cents each. Then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and I enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruit.

This place is spotless, the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good, for a chain."}
{"text":"Hard to believe this Eat N Park has never been reviewed being one of the oldest in the history of the franchise. 

Eat N Park is a local franchise, the corporate headquarters are located at the Waterfront in Homestead. A Family restaurant, the menu is extensive, appetizers to salads, burgers to sundaes. It's all here. Who hasn't come here on the weekend to gorge themselves on the midnight buffet? Admit it, we've all imbibed a bit too much and needed something to make the morning hangover less painful. 

The grilled bearclaw is a Pittsburgh favorite, sweet pasty dough, cinnamon gooey icing, grilled in butter, served hot from the griddle, with coffee or a large glass of milk, this has been my choice meal after many nights of extreme alcohol consumption. 

The Super Burger is their version of the Big Mac. Only made better because it comes served on a dish and not in a cardboard box. With fries, this was a favorite meal when I was growing up. 

Breakfast is where Eat N Park shines, they make some awesome blueberry pancakes. Light and fluffy, stuffed with tons of blueberries and warm syrup, this is one of my favorites. 

Who can resist a smiley cookie? An awesome sugar cookie with glazed icing, they come in a variety of colors and even Pittsburgh sports team colors when it's playoff time. The famous strawberry pie is another favorite of Pittsburgers. Everyone looks forward to the very berry month of May. 

Eat N Park isn't for everyone, but when you crave a bit of the past or need a meal 24 hours a day, Eat N Park will be there."}
{"text":"I recently went into this Eat N Park and had a HORRIBLE experience. The food was sub par and the seating, if you want to call it that, made my butt hurt for weeks. I had a hard time sitting down right for almost a week and a half. How can a restaurant not have proper seating for its paying customers? I shouldn't have to eat this sub par food in a booth that feels like a home for grizzly bears.

Oh, and don't get me started when I asked for the wine list. I enjoy a nice glass of red wine when I indulge myself in an all you can eat buffet. Trying to eat \"fresh\" pineapple with no wine just breaks my heart."}
{"text":"They say that Eat n Parks the place for smiles?  Well it is. Had a great Angus beef double burger. Cooked to perfection and topped with a secret sauce. Also tried the fried pickles for the first time.  Loved them. It was nice that they were pickle spears instead of chips. 
And the home made ranch dipping sauce was creamy and a perfect complement to the pickles."}
{"text":"Server was very friendly and food came out fast. Restaurant was very clean and staff seemed organized"}
{"text":"I have been working here for years and I always have great service and food here (especially if I'm cooking it). The servers really work hard to keep a smile on your face"}
{"text":"Avoid if you have any expectation of reasonably well-prepared food. Highschool cafeteria food prep is better than what comes out from this lazy and obviously inexperienced kitchen staff.

So much for the \"must do\" in Pittsburgh..."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and had a very good experience. The restaurant is clean both on the outside and inside. The staff is very friendly. The choices in food were wide and very reasonably priced. The service was quick and the food was good. Would definitely go back there again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Solid choice for a quick breakfast.   Service was friendly and the food was okay.   The standout to me was the hash brown...lots of onions, yum!   Coffee was good.

I haven't eaten here for lunch or dinner but for breakfast, it's not a bad spot!"}
{"text":"Went to Banksville Eat & Park on Saturday with my family.Our waitress was Bernadette . We had two bills. First she screwed up which bill went to which family. Of course this was after she already charge my account then she took both the bills again and credit my account. You would think this would be over but heck no not with Bernadette she again took my card and charged both bills on my account never ever using my brothers card. How does one do this??? All I can say I will never go back and if anyone else goes pay in cash- u will be charged 100 times if u get Bernadette -Laura I already filled out the feedback form on line and nobody got back to me -I'm happy to say that the General Manager Bob called me and my money will be refunded to me. Very Happy"}
{"text":"My only complaint would be that it takes a bit longer than it should for someone to acknowledge you at the front door. I get it if they are busy, a simple \"hello-be right with you\" could work. Their food is on par with other eat n parks that I have been to. The staff is friendly. I have been here many times and will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and smiling.  It's always open 24/7 which is convenient for us when we need food at late hours of the night. The food always comes fast, fresh, hot, and tastes as good as diner food should.   Requests for condiments are honored which is nice. Sometimes we get servers that will not be attentive or keep our drinks refilled and that can be annoying.   We keep going back though.  I recommend downloading their mobile app to get various periodic coupons."}
{"text":"This Eat n Park location is definitely worthy of a review! A popular chain restaurant in the Pittsburgh region, you can expect a short list of lackluster reviews for these types of restaurants. 

However, when I decided to grab a quick lunch with my (small) immediate family of 13 members with 5 children under 6 (yikes!), and was provided with such great customer service, I feel I have to give a good shout out for this location. 

You can imagine all the good ole stink eyes, sighs, and raised attitudes of hostesses and fellow eaters as a group this size with \"well behaved children\" enters the restaurant, right? But to the contrary, we were greeted with warm personalities and smiles. :-)

A great feature of this location is that they have a separate room that can fit, I say, about 30 people that can be closed off from the rest of the dining area. Luckily for us, it wasn't being used at the time of our arrival and we were quickly seated in about 5 minutes! (Nice, right?) It also looks like this location has been recently renovated and it looks fresh, clean, and new.

Our waitress, simply put, was a miracle worker and a friendly character with the kids. I was pretty impressed with the wait staff and their welcoming attitudes here. It provided a happier atmosphere for everyone. 

You get the quality of food for what you pay for at Eat n Park. For our entire group, it was around $100, which is awesome! For myself, I go for a fresh salad and a hot cup of soup from the salad bar for my meal. 

My only complaint here, and I was originally going to give 4 stars instead of 5, is that they were missing and running low on some important choices from the salad bar. You can't make a salad (from a salad bar) if you don't have any lettuce! :-/ Unless you're boycotting leafy greens for some reason. Fortunately, in a quick swoop, the lettuce replenisher saved the day and we were all able create the salads of our liking. I justified the quick feet and replenishment of the workers to give it the 5-star rating.

They say Eat n Park is the place for smiles, and I definitely walked out with a smile on my face. (Don't forget about the smiley cookies!) They provided heart shaped shaped ones for February. I'd say pick one up to share with someone you love, but let's be honest... you may want to grab two, because you're going to devour it. ;-)"}
{"text":"All right! This place was excellent! I ordered the super burger combo. Comes with a large big mac style burger that is so so tasty! I vot fries and broccoli as my sides. Both were fresh and cooked to simple perfection!

The atmosphere is a large family style diner and its open late. Service was super friendly but not overbearing at all, which I appreciated. Very nice place and highly recommend over nearby chain establishments. 

Worthy of mentioning the oreo milkshake was delicious as well. Stop by!!!"}
{"text":"By no means am I a picky eater, and going into Eat'n Park for their all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch buffet, I was not expecting some Wolfgang Puck level cuisine. With that being said, the food, in my opinion, was tolerable but mediocre at best. Variety wise, there were your breakfast basics (eggs, biscuits, potatoes, sausage, bacon, and pancakes), a salad/salad bar, fruit, pierogies, mini muffins, etc. As anyone would expect, the quality of the food left much to be desired. I could deal with the overcooked eggs and soggy potatoes, but the employees seemed completely oblivious when it came time to restock the buffet. Half the time, there were no clean plates to use. Although they didn't do a great job at managing the buffet while it was brunch time, they were VERY punctual when it came to tearing it down at exactly 2pm. I blinked and half the food was being wheeled back to the kitchen. I dove for the last few muffins I could get my hands on.

Our waitress was a rockstar though. Super friendly and made sure buffet items were refilled after I told her they were empty. She delivered fresh pancakes right to my table once they were finally made - customer service at its finest. 

I'm rating this place 2 stars not only for the overall quality of the food but for the experience that came with it. Nonetheless, $9.99 for an all-you-can-eat breakfast is still a very good deal."}
{"text":"We don't have Eat N Park in Illinois, so when I first saw one, I remarked to my sweetheart, \"eat and park...doesn't it make more sense to park first, then eat?\" Yeah, I know, that's like a bad dad joke.   But anyway, to a foreigner like me, Eat N Park is awesome!    We only come here for brunch, and since I aint got no job and limited funds, it's pretty awesome to enjoy a brunch for two for under $20.  The unlimited house coffee is delicious, and I'm not even a big coffee drinker (more of a tea aficionado myself).   Another thing I dig about this place is even though they're very much a meat and potatoes diner, they're really good about accommodating vegetarian diets.  I like the Smiles."}
{"text":"Eat 'n Park a local and regional chain known for Smiley cookies.

The service here can leave a little bit to be desired. Friendliness goes a long way and it's too bad the employees often seem grumpy here.

Food is exactly as it is at all locations and it comes to the table in a friendly manner."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Eat 'n Park? Especially the salad bar or Superburger? I gotta tell you the Squirrel Hill location is the best when it comes to customer service (let's face it, the food tastes the same at every location). In this case of this decades old local chain it boils down to service. And the team here is simply the best."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews about this place. So many locals swear that they love it here and then a few others say it's terrible. 

We came here on a Saturday night around 6:15 because we needed food in a pinch. They seated us around 6:30ish and it took till 7:05ish for our food to come out. 

I ordered the chicken fajita flatbread. It was surprisingly pretty good. I enjoyed the chipotle sauce and the salsa on it. Their French fries weren't bad either. My friend got the buffalo chicken wrap and it said he wasn't impressed. My mom got the turkey sandwich topped with gravy and wasn't impressed either. My dad is a vegetarian and was very glad to see that they had a salad bar. The salad bar was pretty basic though.

The service was alright and they did their best to bring out the food as soon as they could. The restaurant is a little dirty and could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere. Food is your average diner type but they do have a nice selection of baked goods like pies, cookies, etc."}
{"text":"The food is standardly average local diner food, but good enough.  The corporate mgmt of the restaurant chain has cut costs over the years as evidenced by switching from name-brand artificial sweeteners to generic ones, switching pre-made frozen soup block companies, etc., but at least they've kept Heinz ketchup.  They might have a riot on their hands if they did that.

Breakfast all day is a great feature and the kids love getting their smiley cookies.

The great staff is what earns this place the 4th star.  I've been to other Eat-n-Parks (SHV, I'm talking to you), but the speed and courtesy of the staff is nowhere close to the level at this Eat-n-Park.  Great job, people.  You make us want to keep coming back!  Jessica was super on-the-ball last night making great suggestions, anticipating our needs, and being both efficient and friendly.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Me and E n' P go waaaaay back!  

Our relationship started at 16 years old.  It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches, oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say, I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!

I think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city, so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!

My all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories, ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  

Their breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.  Pancakes, french toast and those delish strawberry muffins!  And seriously, what is up with how good their pistachio whip is on the buffet?  I used to lick the bowl...after it was already made and served...don't worry for all you germaphobes!  

Needless to say, I helped myself to A LOT of samples over the years to be a complete Eat n' Park expert!"}
{"text":"I can't wait for the remodel... a drive through window will satisfy all my needs!!!! Then I'll update my review. For now, I will say that I love Eat n' Park, as it has a special place in my heart. But this visit was not a perfect 5. 

Our order was somehow \"lost\" as we waited starving (after a late night event). Our server was SUPER nice, so it was hard to be mad. Plus, she offered us dessert, so we REALLY couldn't be mad. 

Once we got our meals, I was slightly bummed. My turkey sandwich, which was \"promised\" to be \"just like a Primanti's\" with turkey instead was sad. It had maybe two fries on it, as well as maybe two pieces of cabbage that didn't resemble coleslaw. 

But man, that orea cream pie was to die for! AND she gave us 3 pieces to split. So that is how you earn my love back Eat n' Park!"}
{"text":"Went for the weekend breakfast buffet as the hotel
We were staying at was overpriced. The food was hot. A little too hot as the food was sticking to the bottom of the plastic containers it was held in. The waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"The last two times my family and I stopped by this Eat'n Park it was for the Breakfast buffet. Both times I swore we wouldn't go back. We decided to give them one more chance this morning, what a mistake! 
To start, our waitress was so slow. We got our drinks after we got our food. 
Now, let's get to the buffet. The eggs are usually substandard, but today they were like chewing on rubber. They had no strawberry muffins out. When we asked about them, we were told they were baking some. They never came out with any the entire time we were there!  The toast and the French toast were hard as a rock. They did a horrible job of keeping the fresh fruit and bowls stocked. I guess they should pay me to tell them what needs refreshed. The blueberry yogurt tasted like cardboard. Not like any blueberry yogurt I've ever tasted. 
This is a brand new restaurant, in an affluent suburb of Pittsburgh. It should be held to a higher standard. 
I can guarantee we will not be going to that Eat N Park again."}
{"text":"It's eat n park... its not a 5 star restaurant... if you are looking for an excellent meal, its probably not the place to go. BUT, its a staple of growing up in pittsburgh. I love their breakfasts (those strawberry muffins are soooo good!) and its pretty much a great go-to place for late nights - don't forget a smiley cookie on your way out!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this local spot for a while and finally got around to it! The food was good breakfast diner-esque food, so you can't go wrong. They had a new Cold-Brew Coffee which I really enjoyed as well. The cashier and hostess were very nice. I didn't give more stars is because we had to wait a bit for our food (table next to us came later and got food before us) and our waitress wasn't too enthused. Maybe she was tired? My husband also mentioned that the bathrooms aren't too clean. Prices are good for good portions of food."}
{"text":"I'd like to commend one of your servers. Heather Hampton is phenomenal. She greeted me with a huge smile and was attentive during my visit. It's so great to have such a customer service oriented atmosphere. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I got the test kitchen Salmon Croissant Sandwich and it is as very delicious. One thing I would've changed is instead of using chunked salmon, I would've used a whole plank of salmon. It would've made it less sloppy. Service could've been faster. Overall, the sandwich was good along with the service and so was my experience!"}
{"text":"This Eat'n Park location is always busy..busy enough to have another Eat'n Park location across the street that is equally busy. I dunno..North Hills folk just really love themselves some Eat'n Park.

I've always enjoyed this location..it's big and spaced out in a way that even if it's crowded it doesn't feel like you're being boxed in.

This is another great all night dining option Pittsburghers have as well..they really don't know how lucky they are. 

The things here that stand out the most to me are their coffee and their chicken noodle soup. I'm not a big coffee drinker..just don't really have a taste for it.. it the coffee is is and exception because it is delicious. The chicken noodle soup is all chicken and noodles..the noodles are thick and delicious and the chicken is very tender. Again not a huge soup fan but that stuff is good.

Don't forget to grab a box of smiley face cookies on your way out..they're a Pittsburgh staple and they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the hair in your food...

Halfway through my salad from the kitchen, not the salad bar, a larger black hair was discovered... We should have left then... But thought to give them the benefit of the doubt... A few minutes later, my wife says, \"I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but I just finished my salad and there is a hair in the bottom of the bowl....\"

Absolutely gross... We contacted the manager, cancel our orders and left.... We don't need any food poisoning...."}
{"text":"Food is much better than at Denny's (their most similar competitor) and their prices are also decent.  Where they win is the staff.  This place has the most patient late night staff on earth.  I only come here at 3:00 am, so you can imagine the state of me and my dining companions.  Despite the immature antics of our group, the waitress (and our DD) are always great sports.  the last time they even served one of our group their drink in a sippy cup because he spilled his regular glass.  OK, I admit it...  it was me..."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't write a review for a local chain restaurant like Eat n' Park.  In fact, I really try not to eat at any chain restaurants, but Mom and Sis' like the french toast.  So, the reason for the post... I went there today for a late breakfast with my family.  It's a sunday morning, so we expect to wait.  That's no big deal.  We wait for about 20 minutes to get a table and are seated.  The waitress arrives promptly and since we're trying to make it to a movie we place our order right away.  She seems nice at first and the coffee arrives quickly,,, so far so good.... 10 min, 20 min, 30 min... and no refill on the coffee or water, 40 min...waitress comes by to tell us it will be right up, 50 min, 55 min.,  looks like we're missing IronMan and I'm gonna be forced to endure the Patrick Dempsey chick flick... finally Mom gets up and finds the waitress who argues with her that it's only been 25 minutes... (Huh?).  Then says she'll send over the manager.  The manager arrives tells us they are really busy and her other manager is in the back cooking(Umm, sorry for your troubles, but having the waitress argue with the customer instead of a simple sorry has nothing to do with you being short staffed).  She offers to pay for our breakfast (which is now lunch due to the wait)... Really!  You'll comp. the $3.99 Breakfast smile.  How Generous!  No thanks, you've just wasted an hour of our lives that we'll never get back.  We leave and I'm  stuck eating goobers and watching the McDreamy flick.  

The food is what you'd expect.  Nothing worth commenting on and as I just mentioned the only thing I got to try today was the coffee.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is for my childhood nostalgia for the smiley cookies."}
{"text":"Never disappointed in the food or service. The waitresses here are friendly,efficient and just plain terrific. Their soup is tasty. The pies are worth taking home and telling everyone you made it.  They sell homemade bread and offer take out as well. I am a true fan of this place. I wish there was one in Texas. They would be a huge hit."}
{"text":"My husband and I dine at eat n park occasionally in the mornings so we can take a break from cooking and I have to say this eat n park has better staff than most olive gardens in the north hills lol kind, amazing staff, great food and of course the prices are nice lol keep it up enp!"}
{"text":"All Eat'n Parks are pretty much the same. This one is on the dirtier side, and cleanliness is definately not its strong suit. The food is not that great. The only reason I give it 3 stars is for their pies. The pies are great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Eat 'n Parks. I have very fond memories of coming to this one and the one further north on Ohio river boulevard in Sewickley with friends and family over the years. The food is fresh and fast. I love the salad bar and that they offer healthy options and that they are always striving to expand and improve the menu. If you want a casual tasty meal that isn't fast food this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a while so I'm not sure if management changed but service today was awful.  I arrived and got a booth for my party of 3 more adults and 2 kids.  I was seated at 10:50 am and the rest of us 5 minutes later.  We ordered drinks first and placed our food order at 11:15 because it took a while for the drinks to arrive.  At 11:45 we still had no food and if we hadn't asked our waitress about it, she would never have said anything.  The second time we asked she said the kitchen was backed up and the manager was helping to cook.  Our food finally arrived at noon, that's a 45 min wait.  The restaurant was not that crowded, there was no line waiting to be seated when we arrived or when we left.  I ordered the superburger with a side of mashed potatoes.  The burger wasn't hot and was nearly burnt and the mashed potatoes looked like someone had taken an old baked potato and sliced it and dumped some gravy on top.  The waitress brought me a side dish of actual mashed when I asked but I have to wonder how she did not notice what was on my plate it was so gross looking. By the time our check arrived and I got in my car, i realized I had been in the place nearly 2 hours. It was a bad experience."}
{"text":"This review is for the new Eat n Park's remodeled decor which pays homage to Dormont, new menu items, and the wait staff who are for the most part friendly.  The breakfast and salad and brunch bar, breakfast, and new items like macaroni and cheese bites are the best offers."}
{"text":"The drive through is ridiculous. I ordered fifteen minutes before I arrive, paid, and am on my twenty fifth minute after that, and I'm still sitting here typing this review. I Would've done better to go home and make it myself"}
{"text":"I'm usually happy with my experience at this location, especially when I compare it to the other locations. This time I was pretty disappointed. The salad bar was disappointing, things were empty and weren't refilled. My pancakes were burnt and I did not eat them. My drinks were never refilled and sat on the edge of the table the entire time. It felt like we were being rushed. Our server was nice and we did get our food quickly so I will give two stars but that's it. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this Eat n Park is that there is now a Denny's around the corner. 

Surly waitresses who won't  bring refills or check on you during the meal (especially if you get the breakfast buffet--which is the only way to get your food in a timely manner). 

I wasn't expecting perfection, but if I wanted to do all the work, I would have stayed home."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast and ordered eggs over easy, turkey sausage and rye toast. Eggs came out fried almost hard, the links were pure rubber and the barely toasted soft rye looked like it had been made in a blender. A request for splenda for my coffee was answered by\" not until Friday\" 
thumbs down..."}
{"text":"I was here a few times just for the molten lava cake. It requires no description! They have the best molten lava cake and please do not hesitate to ask for more chocolate sauce. 
For some reason, the second time I visited, they added whipped cream on the side which was totally unnecessary. I am still not sure if that is part of the order since they never gave whipped cream when I got this previously."}
{"text":"We went here on Memorial Day because the usual breakfast venue in Millvale was closed.  I have been there 3 times prior and there has always been something that irked me about the food quality but I have not written a review until today.

On a prior visit please note that I witnessed a waitress come out to the breakfast buffet, pick things off of it and plate them, then go back into the kitchen.  The food was then delivered to a customer that thought they were receiving freshly cooked food.  If this is restaurant policy then it is BS.  I asked the waitress (see below) if she did it for our potatoes and she said no.  Therefore I am assuming it is not allowed...but maybe happens when the boss isn't watching?

My fiancee ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine:
A toasted English muffin topped with spinach, onions, tomato, poached eggs, bacon, and hollandaise sauce. Served with your choice of breakfast potatoes or fresh-cut fruit. Available from 5-11 AM. $8.29

This did NOT have any tomatoes in it.  She has had it before from other places and wanted to try it with tomatoes and alas, they forgot to put them in...  The home fries she ordered were cold and stale tasting as if the waitress or the cook pulled them from the buffet.

I ordered the Original Breakfast Smile:
Includes two eggs, your choice of three pieces of bacon, sausage, or turkey sausage, plus breakfast potatoes or fresh-cut fruit and bread selection. $6.99

My scrambled eggs had 3 spots of runny white in them.  I didn't mention this because it's a minor nuisance because it is disgusting.  I ate them anyway and tried not to mention it.  The sausage patties are the CHEAP bulk frozen patties that you can buy at restaurant depot.  They are nasty but I ate them because I couldn't stomach my potatoes...  I asked the waitress if she pulled them off the buffet and she assured me she did not.  Despite that, they were not fresh or cooked specifically for my order.  They were stale and DISGUSTING.  She offered to bring me something else but I was so pissed off at this point that I just wanted to leave.

The food quality at this place is cheap.  It's staff does not know what fresh delicious food is or they would not serve this swill to paying customers.  Lastly, if your cooks do not know how to cook an egg they should be fired.  Eggs are the first thing you are taught at any culinary arts school and scrambled eggs should not have whites showing nor should they be undercooked.  

I give this place a big fat F.

With two waters and two coffees the total bill was $17.83.  Heather was our waitress and did a good job.  The F rating is solely for the craptastic hog slop they try to pass off as edible food for humans."}
{"text":"I guess it's typical greasy diner food, and I might've been expecting a little bit more like IHOP? The concept was cute with all the smiles, and the service was great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive, but the food was just lacking a lot for me. I think this is definitely more of a spot for drunk college kids on the weekends, and I probably wouldn't come back. I think I'd rather pick up Wendy's."}
{"text":"The place for Smile. Oh is it ever! Eat & Park really knows how to make dining a streamlined experienced. They are the classic Pittsburgh family establishment. After starting with one restaurant, they've grown into a chain that has been perfected! 

My families kids LOVE this place & I love Eat N Park for providing us with such a stress free dining option. The menu options are extensive. They have something for everyone's dining needs- diabetic, allergies, celiac, small portions for kids & seniors, picky eaters... it's amazing just what they've thought of! I can't think of any other restaurant in the country that offers what Eat N Park does! 

Our family has many favorites- just to name a few, the chicken soup is heavenly. As is the fish sandwich w mac & cheese during Lent. There are just so many choices- it really is almost impossible to review just one meal. The thing about Eat N Park is that the menu is straightforward & the calories, ingredients, and all details are readily available upon request. This makes finding a dish that suits ones individual tastes easy and exceptional. Personally, I think you can't go wrong with the hot turkey sandwich & French fries - all covered in gravy. Delicious!  So very delicious!  

And we can't forget to mention the Smiley Cookies. They are iconic! Do not leave without having one if you're dining for the first time! The Smiley Cookies are absolutely the best part. Or maybe the stickies are. Or the the pies. No. The Smiley Cookies are the best... or maybe the stickies.  They are all so amazing! You might have to try them all and decide for yourself!"}
