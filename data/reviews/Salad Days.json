{"text":"The best salad you can afford.  I'm so happy to see they are extending the business into the Bloor station underground right by the food court. Love the place. Only wish they didn't rush you so fast to order and then have you awkwardly wait for someone to make your salad with you.. but I know they need to rush it."}
{"text":"I like the place. I'm sure the new location will be better for them! This is a real $ business! Good for them"}
{"text":"It's a salad bar. Not a whole lot of prep work goes into it so you would expect fresh ingredients. And they are. I ordered a salmon salad while my friend ordered the special (which was chicken breast with some veggies, mash, stuffed grape leaves and Greek salad). I added some capers into my salmon salad which I recommend since it adds more flavour to the salad. The base was a garden mix (so red lettuce, spinach and those dandelion-type leaves) with a few cucumbers, tomatoes and mixed peppers placed on top. Drizzled with a  balsamic vinegar, I think. Finally the smoked fish meat and capers. The salmon tasted fresh and was quite hearty. The leaves were fine and all veggies had a crispness to them, so fresh.   My one complaint comes from tasting the chicken. The chicken had no flavour whatsoever. I'm not sure why, since the stuffed grape leaves had more taste than the chicken. Being super healthy doesn't mean you should give up on flavour!"}
{"text":"Great place for under $10 lunch is a pricey neighbourhood.  Ordered the small veggie plate and it was a huge portion (not quite sure how people finish the large).    Quick note for first timers: the place gets quite packed as customers wait for their food- squeeze your way to the left side to order at the small cash register- MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR RECEIPT- then join the zigzag line for the counter.  Once you get to the counter, give them your receipt and receive your food!  Also, chicken shwarma can sell out early!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick lunch that costs less than 10 bucks and you feel full and it's healthy. I always get the salmon special and the portion sizes are just bursting out of the container.   My go to place, better than going to Subway!"}
{"text":"This place is really as good as it gets for a salad downtown at a reasonable price. Any other place I've tried leaves me with a disappointed stomach, or wallet, sometimes both.  Now I am not a vegetarian, nor a salad man in any respect. In fact, I'm the kind that's usually quite upset if what I'm eating didn't at any point have hopes and dreams of its own, cut short for my own gastric satisfaction. I drive an SUV. I double bag everything. I run the AC with the windows open when its too hot on the balcony. Hell, sometimes I even make derogatory remarks about plants when I'm walking past parks.  That being said, I love this place. I'm not really feeling what others are saying about the size (small actually large!, how can anyone finish a large?!) because for me the large size was just about right to keep me chugging for 4 or 5 more hours. Then again, as a non salad eater, i never really expected to feel /full/ eating one of these. But it definitely fills you up. And not to the extent that you schlep around moaning and groaning for hours after like a hippopotamus with pneumonia.  Their dailies are great, at 5.45 for the large size (6.20 with tax.) They also substitute basically anything you want, no grief, and no cheaping out on the good stuff. Most importantly, so that my savage junk food fiend of a body doesn't shut down in panic, they are heavy on cheese, especially if you ask."}
{"text":"I love this place. A small cobb salad makes a perfect lunch. To be honest there is not much I can contribute to the comments. I strongly recommend Ritual if you want to avoid the long lineup."}
{"text":"One of the best, most affordable salad places in Toronto. I always get the hummus salad for around $5. They give you a lot of hummus with chick peas, veggies and even a pita. It's super delicious! I could have salads from here everyday.   The only point to note is that this place is cash only. It's also only open during the weekdays and closes at 4 pm. Highly recommend this place! I will definitely be going back and trying their entire menu"}
{"text":"Fresh, inexpensive, quick, great quality.  Only downside is lack of seating in this place."}
{"text":"They have a bunch of different salads and wraps here - the best part is you can make substitutions to make it to your liking! My favourite things on the menu are the Niçoise salad and the chicken wrap. Prices here are extremely reasonable given the location and the amount of food you get.   Con - everyone knows about this place so the lines are extremely long during lunch hours. You can ritual it but it still takes 30 during peak hours."}
{"text":"What to say about Salad Days that hasn't already been said? Generous portions of fresh and tasty salads at a very reasonable price. The \"Lunch Special\" is one of the most delicious salads I have ever eaten and for $6.20 cannot be beat! Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I used to go here regularly, but I've noticed of late that the price has gone up and the quality gone down. Two days ago I ordered a small cob salad (my go-to meal at Salad Day's) and the worker gave me one (!) piece of avocado. The small cob used to be full of avocado. Since they charge almost $6for the small, I likely won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for lunch in Yorkville.  The lines are always long but it has everything to do with the value-for-money and nothing to do with them being slow.  This place runs a very efficient lunch service.  If you arrive between 12PM-1PM expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your salad.  My fave is the Cobb Salad but all are excellent.  The ingredients are fresh and plentiful and there will come a time when you might actually ask for less of something knowing you won't finish the salad!"}
{"text":"Yummy salad with decent price. This place has been our go to place for lunch fit over a year. Everyone in our office likes the food. The salads are healthy and in generous portions. Lunch special and Cobb salad are out favorites."}
{"text":"For all you people doing the no-carb diet, this is the place to be. Get a custom salad and pick all your toppings! Cheap, delicious, affordable. Bring cash."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here for lunch. There is ALWAYS a line up during lunch hours, but the line moves fast.   Their portions are huge even when you order a small - you definitely get your money's worth. My favourites from here would be the Cobb salad and the Smoked Salmon salad.   Great thing about this place is that you can substitute the toppings in your salad for anything else so you are paying for exactly what you want to eat!  This is definitely my favourite go-to place if I'm craving a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I usually prefer sandwiches for lunch since I find them more filling and better value than most of the salads in the area (Freshii, La Prep, etc) but Salad Days in the exception.   Salad Days is located on the main floor of Cumberland terrace on the corner of Bloor and Yonge and is probably the best value lunch in the area. It is tucked in a corner and always has a huge line during lunch, although it moves pretty quickly.   They have several pre-set salads or you can create your own salad as well. I usually go for the pre-set Cobb salad, which has corn, chicken, avocado, eggs, lettuce, tomatoes, and some other stuff, and is about $8 for a big container they fill to the brim. The lunch special is a bit cheaper because its in a (slightly) smaller container but its just as good as any of the pre-set salads.   I would definitely recommend it to everyone in the area, and I will be returning to try all the other pre-set salads on the menu."}
{"text":"Yup, it's good. Great friendly staff, very large portions and all fresh ingredients. I really like it."}
{"text":"I go here a couple of times a week on my lunch break for an inexpensive salad or wrap. Ingredients are always really fresh and portions are huge. Lineup is always long especially around 12-1.30 but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, it's my go to spot for lunch. The cobb salad is great, has everything I want in a salad, if you don't want a certain ingredient you can substitute it. The small salads are huge, the ingredients are fresh. Can't ask for a better salad place!"}
{"text":"Can't be beat for the healthy and taste to price ratio."}
{"text":"Portions are huge for what you pay for and the staff is efficient . I wish they would tell you what's in the special salads . Everyone gets the Cobb salads but what's in all the other options?!  Also, they're generally pretty good at substituting ingredients.. i.e. you can get chickpeas in lieu of the corn. But you will have to pay extra for trying to substitute lettuce for spinach."}
{"text":"Salad Days has opened at Yonge Bloor Subway and I am so happy! I actually hate salads however they make them filling and wonderful! Love their special salad too witht he grape leaves and sweet potato!!! I am going to be going there everyday! And they are so accomodating because I take subway in morning to work at Yonge and Finch and I get my salad in the morning and keep it till lunch time!! Yonge and Finch does not have nice health options so this place has been a life saver!! THANK YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"$5.30 tax in, for a delicious Cobb salad (small size), that is arranged with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, corn, avocado, feta cheese, Olives, half an egg, and some chicken slices. It's enough to make you content.  Extremely fresh and delicious.  Definitely going to be here often for lunch!   Cash only, long lineups during prime times."}
{"text":"Great prices, large portions, and fresh taste.  This is a great spot for a no frills salad lunch.  The line ups are long and they only accept cash.  The line up moves fast.  There are a few seats outside reserved for salad days and esters soups.  Note that this is inside, in a food court type setting, so not great ambience.  But if you are going out to grab a quick lunch for the office or don't mind sitting in the food court, its fine.  They have no problem substituting things and i can't complain about the portions, very big for salad these days."}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Real Food. Fast.   Can't go wrong with the fellas at Salad Days. Best for lunch. Go around 1:30-2pm for not too many people and quick service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best salad bar in the city. I'm not lying when I say they stuff the containers full. Their ingredients are always fresh. The daily special with chicken is my go to! It tastes delicious. I've also had a Cobb salad which was just as tasty.   You must try this place if you are in the area. Most, if not all, large salads will run you less than $10. You cannot get this good of a deal with fresh items, anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Fast. Fresh. Friendly. Great value for the money. I typically order online with Ritual to avoid any line, but one day the app didn't work (my fault, it needed an update) and when I came to order my salad in person they didn't charge me! Not necessary, but so appreciated. Great example of great customer service."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! ALWAYS GO HERE FOR LUNCH when in the 'hood Fresh Big quantities Amazing price Friendly Fast for the # of people they serve I'm always full and satisfied"}
{"text":"big portions. fresh and healthy. great for grab and go"}
{"text":"Perfect place if you are looking for a healthy lunch option.  I decided to make my own salad. I ordered a large baby spinach salad with grilled chicken  and pomegranate dressing. This tasted terrible! This was completely my fault,I've mixed all the wrong ingredients. When I  was ready to eat my salad I realized that  the attendant had forgotten to add the grilled chicken. I came back to the store for the rest of my sald, the staff was apologetic and quickly chopped up some chicken for me. While I was waiting I noticed a lot of people ordering the same thing,  the small cobb salad. I might try that next time."}
{"text":"I love this place with a passion. I look forward to work just so I can get lunch from here. And earning a living too I guess, but Salad Days though.... Everything is so fresh, so EFFICIENT, and so good (crying face emoji).  It's just good, okay? Good for you, good for your tastebuds, good for your wallet, good for your local economy.  Good? Good."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Salad Days given the rave reviews I've seen. I got there around 1:30pm on a weekday ---it can be tricky it find if you don't work in the Cumberland building and you are coming from the Bloor & Yonge subway station like I was. Make sure to read the signage that leads you to Cumberland.  There was a line up at the shop when I got there, and I really appreciated the posters all the interior and exterior of the shop so you can decide what you want as you are lining up. The daily lunch special looked really good. It was the greek salad with sweet potato mash and grilled chicken and salmon if I remember correctly.  The employees at the counter were very fast and efficient, kudos to them for being able to work so fast in such a tiny space! The wait was not long at all, and everyone there seem to be regulars because the employees already know what they were going to order once they see them. All the good signs so far.  As I progressed through the line I realize that the register had no interac machine, so I looked all over the store to see if there was a sign saying it was cash only. There was none. I was next in line already so I had to go get cash from an ATM down he street before coming back again.  I only had to wait about 2 minutes this time (before I was sure which of the delicious salads I want to order actually) and I decided on the small nicoise salad. I saw that they had smoked salmon on the menu so I asked for smoked salmon to be added on as extra. The cashier just looked at me with a stunned expression on her face, and said there is already two scoops of tuna that comes with the salad. I said that's amazing, I did not want to substitute tuna for smoked salmon, but I want to pay to have an extra portion of smoked salmon on the side. She still didn't seem to understand what I'm talking about. So I asked how much they charge for an extra portion of smoked salmon, she hesitated and asked how many pieces I wanted. Now it's my turn to be surprised. The menu clearly had an option to add smoked salmon to a customized salad for an added cost but she just refused to do that for me for some reason.  So I walked out with my salad feeling quite let down to be honest. The salad itself is great, very fresh like many others have said, not as big of a portion like many others have stated in my opinion but overall, it was a fair deal considering its location and quality.  Would I go back again? Yes, if I'm in the area, and is looking for a fresh, good quality inexpensive option. I definitely want to give this place another chance, but they definitely need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Lineup is long as hell! But well worth the wait. Huge portions and great prices."}
{"text":"Aside from the long line-ups at lunch, this place is fantastic. The food is always fresh, tasty and healthy. The staff are very friendly and will allow multiple substitutions and customisation. The prices are reasonable and you can order on your phone to avoid the line up! Great spot for a quick lunch time meal."}

{"text":"Great value! Try not to come around the lunch hour rush. Even though I got there around 1:15pm, there was still about a 15 minute line. I can imagine a much longer wait around noon.  I got the greek salad with chicken breast, dolmades, and two scoops of sweet potato mash and was very happy with the portion size and the price (~$7). The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the chicken breast which tasted boiled/steamed rather than grilled. Other than that it was a great flavour combination especially with the hearty dollops of hummus and tzatziki.  The restaurant is located on the concourse level - just follow the signs to the food court and you will see it along the way.   Also, they take credit card now!"}
{"text":"I tried out this place based on the positive reviews and I did not have a similar experience. The staff were impatient and even after I mentioned that it was my first time and I wasn't sure how the ordering process worked I got a blank stare. After I finally got my salad it did not taste good. I asked for honey dijon dressing and I got some watery dressing that had a kick to it. It tasted very vinegary.  I will not go back - 80% of the reason is the rude and impatient staff and 20% of the reason is the food taste."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the area where you can get a lunch with a drink for under $10. The fact that it's mostly healthy stuff is a great bonus! Portions are substantial, no wimpy salads here.  If you get here during the lunch rush (11:30ish-2:00ish), expect a lineup. The line moves quickly and despite the small space, is very efficient.  I really like the special: chicken breast, greek salad, stuffed vine leaves and sweet mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"This place has crazy lineups at lunch for a good reason!  A super convenient spot being located by the underground Yonge subway entrance in Hudson Bay Center.   Fresh ingredients and large portions at a very reasonable price.   The smoked salmon salad is my favourite, but the falafel and nicoise would be my next choices. Hmm... Maybe Apple and beet... So many choices!! :)"}
{"text":"That's a whole lot of salad for $4!  Located in the limited food court of Cumberland Terrace, this busy little stand is a fantastic spot for a quick lunch.  It's more like a 3 star salad stop, but I gave an extra star for being one of the cheaper healthier options in the area.  The small is a perfect sized serving.  It's one of those small styrofoam take out containers but packed to the max.  The large salad comes in a plastic box and it's ginormous.  Like freaking intimidating.  So, I usually get a small.  They have wraps here too but the most popular item seems to be the Cobb salad.  Iceberg lettuce (bleh),  golden kernals of corn, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, chunks of chicken, and lots of avocado. Topped with a house vinaigrette it's a tasty and healthy lunch!    Now what surprised me was how much avocado they give you.  And it was perfectly ripe and it wasn't quite half an avocado but a whole lot.  I'm a fan of this little salad stand.  I still have to try the smoked salmon salad.  Why pay twice as much for your salad at Freshii?"}
{"text":"Great lunch option. Cheap, healthy, fresh and delicious. I had a large salmon salad so big that the box couldn't close. The portion of each ingredient was generous. There was a queue as I got there but the service was so fast that I didn't have to wait. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The quantity and quality that come with their salads is phenomenal. Probably the cheapest lunch you can get around the Yorkville area. Typically I spend between $5-$8 and always leave feeling satisfied. Plus, you feel good about yourself since everything there is so fresh and healthy. I recommend their cobb salad as well as their lunch special.   Cobb salad has a lettuce base with ample toppings of avocado, corn, feta, chicken and half a hard boiled egg.   Their lunch special is a greek salad with chicken and the best part is the sweet potato mash, so filling and delicious!!   The best part is if you're a picky eater, they will make you a salad with basically any combination of ingredients.   I had two co-op work terms downtown by Queen's Park Station and on my short 40 minute lunch break I would subway up to Yonge-Bloor station just for Salad Days. Lunchtimes can be busy, but I always came after 1:30 and the service was always quick and friendly :)"}
{"text":"Having been to the old Salad Days location at 2 Bloor Street West, I already knew how good the food is. I am glad they moved even closer to my apartment as they serve great quality salads at reasonable prices, and the portions are HUGE!  I chose a large salad with chicken and added four toppings. The total came to $9.66 including tax which is pretty good value, considering they CRAM the container full of food.  The line ups are very long around lunch time so I would suggest getting their earlier rather than later. Having said that, the line moves fast and I was in and out in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Tasty YES.  But owners: take a tip and look at IQ foods menu (2 locations downtown).   Id rather pay a bit more for ORGANIC produce, avocado, organic eggs, hormone free chicken etc.  Please get with the health needs of the health conscious and offer more choices even if more expensive, we will buy it.  ANd do takeout boxes for dinner like IQ foods for the densely populated bay/bloor area.  Freshi in the area needs to clean up their act as well."}
{"text":"I've been there at lunch twice. Ordered small Cobb Salad and small Baba Ganouj. Both very filling... no need for drink or dessert. Delicious, too! The line might look intimidating but it moves pretty fast. Plus, there's always someone playing live music. So there really is no reason to complain :P"}
{"text":"Love this place - great healthy food, fair prices and runs like a swiss watch. Try the fatouche."}
{"text":"Cheap Healthy eatery!  A line is always good.  I had the lunch special but there was no stuffed grape leaves :( Overrall--cheap and good!"}
{"text":"The most amazing Cobb salad and you get enough food to feed a small African nation."}
{"text":"$4.20 for a salad so big I can't even finish it? HELLO!  This place always has a long line and for good reason. They pack your little take out containers shock full of fresh salad ingredients. You can go the 'make your own' route if you're picky, but most people choose their pre-made deliciousness. Cobb salad is my favourite of the ones I've tried.  Oh ya, and the guys behind the counter are so smiley and friendly. They work so quickly and still take the time to smile. If you're in the area, this place is worth your time and money.  FYI: CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Great staff. Inedible food. Inedible. Chicken was waterlogged and rubbery. Disgusting. Inedible. Neither of us were able to finish the meal. Veggies were between fresh and suspect. Some were bad and some were acceptable but nothing was good. The cucumber was decent and that's about it.   Pro tip: 200 meters away is Salad House. They have 10 on 10 salads. Everything super fresh, oversized and made from scratch with love. Their shwarma chicken is a treat on salad! All their sauces are homemade. Night and day difference between these two.   Came to salad days due to the reviews and because Salad House was closed. I wish I got pizza or Macdonald (and I don't eat McDonald's) my date literally closed her box and said \"that was gross\".   But the staff are awesome! Wish they had good food."}
{"text":"My friend mentioned a salad place by her office and I was in the area and decided to try it.  Wow it's so great!  The selection, it all looks and tastes fresh and the portion is huge.  Considering I got a large Niçoise salad for $8 after tax with 3 heaping scoops of tuna when I get a salad druxy salad by my office which is almost same price without any protein.  Def coming back!"}
{"text":"I dont get why this has such a high rating. Food did not taste fresh. Chicken is seasoned in God knows what and was cold, plus you get such a small amount. I don't understand why they just slop everything into the bowl, it comes out looking like a dysfunctional mess. I didn't even get a chance to ask for dressing on the side before she covered everything in it.  Do people actually like mashed sweet potatoes on salad? Seemed so strange and wrong to me.  Do yourself a favour and take the subway two stops south to College and go to Salus Fresh Foods. Now that's actually quality food. Your mind will be blown if you're used to this garbage."}
{"text":"I know this place is cheap but don't have the chicken it doesn't taste good and the corn was old.  It had good and bad days but it's not always fresh"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of buying salad outside but this place is sweet!  It's relatively cheap, fresh, delicious, and located right next to Bloor subway. Always walked passed it and never stopped to try, but today I managed to with my coworkers. They have a good variety of pre-built salad and wrap choices. I tried the Cobb Salad (small) - it was only $4.95 ($5.60 after tax) and they fill the salad box up to the max! I loved the ingredients they give and for the Cobb, you can choose either Feta or Blue cheese yummmms!  I'm pretty filled up even with their small salad portion. Next time, I would want to try their Smoked Salmon Salad, Hummus Salad, or their Special (large) for only $6.49.  Their staff and service is alright. Pretty quick given the many employees during lunch rush. Never go around 12PM noon, or else the line up is huge!"}
{"text":"How can they survive with such a low price? I give them 10/10 as it is worth every cent. Fresh and Delicious... I see this location as \"take out\" I totally recommend Salad days. I will go there every day if I can. The only issue is that it is cash only. I am pretty sure customers do not mind pay 5% more and use their credit card if they don't have cash on them."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a salad lunch, this is where I go. Yes, the line up is long, but there's a reason for that. The salads are meals. Not these measly little boxes you get from Freshii.   My go to is always the large Cobb. What you get with that is a huge container of satisfying crunch that covers all the food groups in one meal. Who doesn't love a generous scoop of avocado with their meal?  Considering the area, $8 for a meal salad is actually quite the steal."}
{"text":"Fresh , Healthy well sized salads customized to your liking. I also get 1 cheese pie and I spinach pie as an afternoon snack . I cant believe I just started eating here . The staff are so friendly, helpful and so courteous ."}
{"text":"While $6 sounds like a lot for a salad, these salads are more like a full meal and fairly calorie dense. I can eat 30 pieces of sushi and still not feel full, so while $6 sounds like a lot for a salad, it fills me up. The flavor is pretty good, but nothing mind blowing. There isn't some amazing salad dressing you've got to try or anything. It's just some good ingredient combined together to make a filling meal that tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I recommend walking a few minutes over to the other Salad Days location (the original in Cumberland Terrace).   This one doesn't seem as familiar with the menu options and so sometimes they leave ingredients off that the other location adds (e.g. I've gotten the smoked salmon salad and it's just been lettuce, cucumbers and smoked salmon here whereas the other location adds peppers and capers). The portions are smaller here too. Still, it's a pretty healthy, quick and cheap lunch option and I wouldn't turn it down!    Agree with the tip about using Ritual (and I think they are on Grabb too). You can skip the line that way (but the line moves pretty fast)."}
{"text":"$4 salads!? How can you not go wrong! If you work in the Yonge and Bloor area, this place is awesome for custom salads. It's located within the Cumberland Shops area. The best part is they really pack it in with food. Proportions are great!   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND... - Turkey Cobb Salad - Smoked Salmon Salad"}
{"text":"Great food and staff are more than happy to serve you with a big smile every time I go ."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice when I've been in the area and in a rush, looking to pick up something light. Saw the rave reviews on Yelp, but coasting on a good price point and enticing variety isn't going to do it for me. I need more. The two things that I have tried (small cobb salad and daily special, fish version) were not fresh at all and I couldn't even finish the special. The olives tasted off, as did the sweet potato mash. I won't be returning, not that they need my business - this spot is so popular!"}
{"text":"Salads and wraps are great. Giving it 3 stars because of how the owner treats his employees. He needs to appreciate them more and not treat them like they are garbage. Also him and the other guy that is usually on cash need to stop chewing gum!"}
{"text":"I walk by here every morning and evening to get to work after exiting from bloor subway station, but it was always closed. Thats the first con; the hours are limited so you can only really get brunch/lunch here. What's more is that the store hours are not written anywhere on the store.  While the store is open however, I wouldnt have the liberty to ask the store owner as the place gets PACKED. especially during lunch time, you can expect to see a lineup outside the small, green shop, and wait times are around 15 minutes. There were about 6-7 employees (including the owner) in the small shop though, so i can see they make an effort to serve all the customers.   I was quite impressed with the display of fresh foods (fruit, veggies, cheese, dressings and mystery things). All the food looked healthy and fresh and I saw them refilling the foods several time while i was waiting in line; nothing was pre-packaged, or coming out of a plastic bag.  I ordered a small cobb salad for 4.75, (5.35 with tax) and was pleasantly surprised with the salad. I also replaced the boiled egg for sweet potato puree they have. this is DELICIOUS and i highly recommend having this in whatever salad you get. The serving of chicken was quite small but the overflowing fresh foods made up for it.  The cons are that firstly, the salads are packed to the brim of the container. Although some may appreciate the quantity, I found mine to fall out of the container as soon as i opened it at work, not to mention the dressing spilled everywhere.  Secondly, the staff, although plenty, is still really busy and gives the place a rushed feeling. I felt uncomfortable and rushed when making my decisions and didnt get the opportunity to ask for any additional substitutes because the girl took my order and ran off right after. If you're looking for personal, and attentive service, salad days is not for you.  All in all though, the food is extremely fresh, filling, and offers great nutritious value and diversity for a modest price, so four stars for me!"}
{"text":"Greedy greedy greedy! Never again. $2 plus price hike and serving half the amount. Used to swear by it, but never again. Hate greedy businesses."}
{"text":"I don't really need to review this place seeing all the good reviews below, but my experience was so good that I feel inspired to write one.  While it's true that the lines are long at lunch time, the workers have it running like a well-oiled machine and I got to the front in no time. The service came with a smile which is pleasantly surprising given the crowd that these people have to deal with at lunch.   Their salad special, comprised of Greek salad, stuffed grape leaves, chicken, hummus, tzatziki and a couple of dollops of mashed sweet potatoes (random...but I'm not complaining) is a phenomenal deal at $7 including taxes. The portion is enough for 2 meals - this coming from someone with a pretty big appetite (all I had for dinner was soup after having this at lunch). The salad was super fresh and very tasty.   I usually feel ripped off after getting lunch downtown but I am quite satisfied with everything about this place. Will be my new go-to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place - cheapest/best lunch in the area. I love the cobb sad - for $5.50 for s small - it's HUGE."}
{"text":"If you are looking great salads packed full of flavor and easy on your wallet then I suggest you check out Salad Days.   I had the chicken special salad which is basically a Greek chicken salad with romaine salad as a base,  cucumbers,  tomatoes,  red onion, feta cheese, kalamata olives, tahini,  hummus,  and taziki, paired with some nicely grilled chicken!  Oh I forgot to mention that It also comes with mashed sweet potatoes and 2 Domas!   You might be thinking Wtf?  Mashed sweet potatoes with a salad?   But my friend!  Once you try It the flavors hook you in!  The combination of everything is amazing and not to mention that you stay pretty full until dinner time!"}
{"text":"Always soooo packed for lunch. I personally think is just a temporary fad with all the lunch goers flocking to salad bars. But this is a pretty nice little spot with an extremely fast service and delicious healthy snack food (you can only stay full on greens for so long).  I love their lunch deal that caters to all tastes including vegetarians.  Don't forget it's a cash only place and be prepared for a scary looking line that moves fast and you can indulge into a freshly mixed salad for your lunch=)"}
{"text":"The Salad House can be tricky to find but it's well worth searching out this local gem. Located inside Cumberland Terrace, you'll be able to spot the Salad House by it's long line of lunch regulars. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes to get your salad (they offer wraps as well), it's worth the wait.  I'm a big fan of the Cobb salad which seems to be a crowd favorite with most patrons. They jam-pack a takeout container with romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumber, chunks of seasoned chicken breast, avocado, tons of corn and chickpeas, half a hard-boiled egg and either feta or blue cheese, topped with a tasty house vinaigrette.   Sometimes I can't even finish this in one sitting which makes the low-price tag (about $8) even more appealing. Stick that baby in the fridge at work and I've got a snack for that afternoon craving."}
{"text":"I was wandering around after an interview and just happened to stumble upon this small salad joint.   It was a bit busy but the staff were very kind and efficient. They quickly took my order ( I opted for the salad special) and prepared it diligently.   In terms of the salad itself, it tasted as fresh as it looked and their sauces were full of flavour. For about $7 (with tax), you definitely get your money's worth, if not more. If I'm ever in the area again, I will have to try out another one of their salads!"}
{"text":"Smoked Salmon Wrap with Capers for 6.50 cad tax included? Sweet deal!"}
{"text":"So glad Salad Days opened at Yonge and Bloor! Great quality at a fantastic price point! It's become my new go to lunch and sometime dinner place - making it easier for me to stay on track with my diet :) I love their Cobb salad! They do get very very busy during lunch time but they are well staffed - the line moves fast considering the crowd. The service is great as well! If you don't want a certain ingredient in your special salad, they are open to substituting with another ingredient which is great! I used to frequent Freshii across the street for salad, Salad Days is now my new favourite!"}
{"text":"The salad days of Salad Days were back when it was Salad House. That's salad irony.  They charge $2.50 for chicken and $1 for smoked salmon or tuna. But whenever I swap out the meat in my Cobb salad for fish, the cubed chicken becomes 2 tiny scant pieces of salmon, if I'm lucky. Huh? They also throw in just a little bit less of everything now: less avocado, three carefully counted olives, and no longer the beloved problem of closing the lid. I guess with the perma-queue out the door, they can afford to cut some corners.  The previous owner was anything but skimpy, so the change in management is definitely notable. It's still the best salad option in the neighbourhood though, so whatever, I'll see you there at 12:30.  UPDATE (11/29/2013): There was a long hair in my salad today. I think it's safe to say today was a very dark Salad Night."}
{"text":"Salad House is a tiny gem of a place in Yorkville for lunch-it used to be in Roy Square but after the development there it has resettled into the Cumberland Terrace mall on the street level.   Just a small take out joint selling salads, soups and wraps but at  wallet friendly prices.....everything here is easily priced here under $10, large salads coming to 6-7 unlike the Lettuce eateries sprouting up around town or Fast Fresh Foods downtown. You can start with a base salad and add a few extra fixin's from eggs to beans for extra buck. All in all a cheap place to grab a quick lunch at Yonge and Bloor."}
{"text":"You will find yourself in a long line up when going during the lunch rush, but it's definitely worth it. The line was far out the door but the wait was no longer than 10 minutes. They're very fast paced with your order. I had a small Cobb salad for lunch and it was the perfect serving size for me!"}
{"text":"Working in the Yorkville/Church-Bloor area, it can be quite the endeavour to find good cheap food.  When I saw the sign that Salad Days was opening up soon right next to the subway, I got excited but I tempered my expectation understanding that rent must be exorbitantly high and that prices wouldn't be the same as the Cumberland location.    To my surprise, the prices were the exact same.  I think the best deal is to get a cobb salad or their chicken special.    I already have a review on the old location, so I'll just speak to some of the positive and negative differences.    Positive: -Same price, as mentioned above.  -Chicken is now cooked fresh as opposed to being brought in (I saw the oven) -They have falafel wraps now (don't think they have it at the other location).   -They take debit  Negative: -None really, except this place gets lineups at around 11:15 to 11:30, whereas the lineups don't really start until 11:45 to 12 at the other location.  -For some reason, I find the chicken saltier at this loction.    Verdict: This is a great place to get a good cheap healthy meal for under $5."}
{"text":"Came to the new location after work for the first time and 1) it's open after 5pm (Win! Great opportunity to pickup last minute dinner options) and 2) the portions are loaded for the large sizes and is very much affordable. A large salad averages $8 and is pretty much \"all you can stuff\" in a box. What makes it even better is that each salad comes with lots of toppings which you can easily opt for something else on the table.   As it was my first time there I didn't know what was in each salad to start with so couldn't customize as much as I wanted to, but now I know better. You live and you learn!"}
{"text":"Wow I just realized I never wrote a review for this.  This is not a 5 star restaurant, but value is definitely 5 stars!  Dear Yelp,  If you ever do an article on healthy lunches, this place must be featured!  The Cobb salad is excellent and is way better than a Wendy's salad or Freshii. Packed with lettuce and very healthy servings of corn, avocado, chicken, corn, and egg, it is one of the best salads around!  The salads are so good that a few of us started going and now when we go, we end up with an order of 4 to 8 salads for our coworkers.  The people there are so nice and efficient as well.  The other salad I really like is their special, which is in one large styrofoam container which has a Greek salad base, mashed sweet potato, vine leaves, your choice of cheese and roasted chicken for only 5.49! I never thought I would be eating salads for lunch but now I go there at least twice a week.  Even their \"basic\" salad is stuffed with goodies.  Even my boss, who isn't exactly a healthy eater asked for a salad because everyone else was eating it.  He ordered a Caesar salad, which in most places is lettuce, bacon bits, croutons, cheese and dressing mostly packed with lettuce - well not here, you get a healthy serving of all those plus tomatoes, cucumbers and chicken and we even asked for extra cheese on the small salad.  Doesn't this sound yummy and expensive? Yummy - yes, expensive - no, the small was only 3.79 before tax!  This would cost you at least 8 dollars at Longo's.  Even if you are not a salad eater, you have to try this place if you work or live in the area..,its worth the walk to Salad Days..and here - you DO make friends with salad!"}
{"text":"It was slightly hard to get to, but once my friend and I found it, it was smooth sailing from there. The place was a lot smaller than we expected it to be (it has just enough space for people to go in, order, and get out), but there was a seating area just outside the 'food stand' that could accommodate a good number of people.   I ordered the lunch special, a greek salad with grilled chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, and stuffed vine leaves, $6.45, which was equivalent to the size of a large salad. My friend ordered the small greek salad, $4.85. Both of our salads were so filled that the containers could barely close!   For my lunch special, the chicken felt a touch undercooked, but was by no means inedible. The mashed sweet potatoes were under-seasoned for my liking. The stuffed vine leaves, although I've never had stuffed vine leaves before, tasted as though there was room for improvement.   However, my friend and I really enjoyed the greek salad by itself so we will come back for that, especially at the price that it is.  While we were waiting for our food, I started chatting with a man who I can only assume was the owner of the place. He was very kind, just as the rest of the employees. After we paid, we went to sit at the seating area. The owner saw us sitting, came over, and asked how everything was, all the while still beaming as before! He left and we thought that that was it. But he came back out with bottled water for each of us and said that he \"had a surprise for us\"! Ok... wonder what that could be? Well, a few minutes later he came back to our table and gave us a spinach roll! It was probably because we were first-time customers but regardless, it was a really nice and unexpected gesture!  As mentioned above, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gary S. recommended this place to me a while back, but I hadn't had the chance to eat here until recently and I'm really glad I listened to him.  The Food: We ordered the lunch special which as Gary also mentioned, is the salad, chicken, and sweet potato mash. It also came with stuffed grape leaves and hummus. It tasted fantastic and the portion was quite big. I wasn't able to finish the sweet potato mash.  The Place: It's a fast food joint with a fair amount of seating.  The Service: When we went, around 2pm,  there was a line, but it wasn't long and moved pretty quickly. The people were polite and made the salad very quickly.  The Verdict: An excellent place for lunch. Value-wise, it isn't bad, and you feel good afterwards for having eaten something healthy."}
{"text":"Amazing prices, very fresh, healthy ingredients. This is a place you can eat at everyday. Perfect for your average downtown worker."}
{"text":"this place is top notch and always a hot spot. when i wofked in the area i would come here at least 3tines a week.  great toppings for wraps pitas and epic salads.  the chicken special is where its at!!  i wish they had a buy ten or buy 20 and get one free kind of thing to appreciate loyal customers.  at the end of the day... that would be nice"}
{"text":"i love salad days.  im here frequently bc its next to my work and it forces me to eat healthy!  portions are great as well as huge selection and decent price.  i honestly cant count how many times im here probably at least 1 or 2 times a week. i will say though that as an extrenely loyal customer it would be nice if this place has stamp cards or something to acknowledge the frequency of their customers.  theres no loyalty to their cystomers and maybe its because they dont need it.  it would be nice though to be acknowledged.  but with the high traffic and consistently busy line why would they?  you never know though even when business thrive customer appreciation is important.   the lineups may be long but they are a well oiled machine and extremly efficient."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch places! I've tried their Cobb salad and daily special. Both are great and portions are HUGE for the price. I always feel full after eating here for lunch. Lines are always long during lunch time, but you can also order for pickup using apps like ritual. They also have two locations that are pretty close together (Bloor and Yonge, Bloor and Bay)."}
{"text":"As long as I've worked in the Bay and Bloor area, Salad Days has been a lunch staple for me. Despite the low score (2.5 to be more specific) I give it, I frequent it regularly - you won't find a decent design-you-own salad at this price anywhere else. And their ingredients are fantastic.   Years ago, when I first stumbled upon this literal hole-in-a-wall salad place, I was not just astonished at it's prices, but also how, for a measly five dollars, they would send you on your way with a large salad bursting out of its plastic container with smoked salmon and avocado.   Today, the price has gone up, and the portions have gone down. I'm not sure whether the primary cause is inflation, or the massive influx of new customers, or the change in management, or all three - but the fact remains that this once bastion of value and nutrition has slipped a little. Mainly in the protein department -  1 dollar used to get you enough smoked salmon to make a lame \"whoa this is a lox of smoked salmon haha\" pun. Or 2-3 scoops of tuna. Now, you might as well stop downstairs at Bloor Street Market and buy your own protein to add.   With that said - keep in mind that you can still get terrific wraps, an eclectic lunch special, and an A+ Cobb. The value in this neighbourhood is unparalleled, so I still recommend, but you simply can't compare the current incarnation with the previous regime, which was undoubtedly a build -your-own-salad paradise. It's like pitting Simpsons season 9 to season 4. Sure, there are still some okay episodes here and there, but it's just not the same show."}
{"text":"This is my go-to salad joint since 2010, and I still frequent it almost on a weekly basis. The quality has stayed the same more or less for the past 6 years, and that alone says a lot!   The VFM food here is their Cobb salad. A small Cobb is $5.60 (tax in) for a decent portion. You could get another ingredient instead if you opt out on the cheese. Now that it has two locations around Yonge/Bloor and Bay/Bloor areas, the line-ups are not so bad."}
{"text":"Decent portions, but the extremely hard, unripened avocado ruined my salad.  Probably won't be returning, considering the price is similar to Freshii and Freshii is much better."}
{"text":"This is a great inexpensive place to get some healthy food. Glad I didn't have to pay the crazy $10+ costs for salad they have DT.  The line was long but moved quite quickly and there is even seating in a solarium type setting.   I looked up reviews in advance cause I wasn't exactly sure where it was, it's located on ground level of the Cumberland Terrace.  I got the lunch special which is salad, chicken and sweet potato mash. Everything was excellent and cheap too, $5.65 I think? Only down side I'd say is the chicken portion is small but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded down. Everything looks super fresh here! I came here around 2 for a late lunch. They have some many different choices of fresh veggies and a lunch special that can't be beat. I got a make your own salad (small) and this allowed me to choose 4 items from their large assortment of items.  A small salad is $5.35 and a large is $6.65  With tax, a small custom salad was just under $7. The price certainly can't be beat by any of the retailers in the nearby vicinity, however, I think part of it is the atmosphere or the fact I wasn't feeling salad on my visit this particular day...I'll be back, perhaps to try the lunch special :)"}
{"text":"Only been twice and I am absolutely in love with Salad Days !! I frequent the cafeteria at the Hudson's Bay Center for lunch and I always pass this place, too intimidated by the huge line up that goes out the door.  However, I read the online reviews for this place as well as the one in Cumberland Terrance and decided why not? I love that this location is accessible from the Yonge subway station without having to leave the building. Perfect for these cold winter days where it's too cold to step foot outside to its Bloor West location.  They are exceptionally accommodating to any requests and substitutions. I ordered the Cobb salad on Grabb (an app to order food for take out) and being a vegetarian, opted to have either hummus or mushrooms to my order instead of chicken. When I opened the box, I saw that they gave me both the items generously. A small was more than enough to fill me up, the styrofoam container was packed to the extreme.  Be prepared for a 10-15 wait for your food during rush hour but that's a standard wait time for any decent place that isn't fast food junk. So glad to have finally tried this place out!"}
{"text":"Wow! I have meant to try this place for lunch for a few months and it is definitely as good as all the yelpers claim.   The location is not easy to find, its is tucked in the back of the 2 Bloor St. West building (on Cumberland), I had trouble to find the location and called the store and the patron came outside to help me locate the store! What a super friendly bunch!  I ordered a lunch special off ritual (to avoid waiting for the long lineups) for a little bit over $7, I got exactly what I had asked for. The vegetables are fresh and the portions are very generous. Despite the 20 minutes walk from my office, I intend on making this place my regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed to say the least.  I don't understand how they survive with their amazing huge salads for such an inexpensive price. Worth the wait for sure!!! The line was scary at first but then I realized how quick it went and why everyone was waiting.  Amazing, fresh and healthy! My #1 go to spot so much that I can't keep myself away."}
{"text":"Such a great price for fresh-tasting food! Their chicken wrap is A++ - chicken was flavourful and there was just so much stuff! Definitely wolfed this down without regret. Their salad special of the day is worth mentioning because: amazing value."}
{"text":"You are getting a lot of food for the price here, and it's fresh and custom made for you. And don't forget about the sizes! I saw someone getting a tuna wrap and they put three HUGE scoops of tuna on that wrap.   My fave order is the greek salad with chicken. The small cost me less than $6 and I couldn't eat it all. Lots of feta! Yum!  Lunch time is very busy. There will be a line-up, but even when it looks like a long wait, it's not bad. They have a lot of staff and they move quickly.  Lots of choices: salads wraps, all sorts of toppings. Go check it out yourself.   Take-out only, but there are tables in the food court quite close by and downstairs too."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for lunch. They pack the box to full capacity! Always fresh."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Always busy at lunchtime but the line moves very quickly. Super cheap, fresh, and generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place after a year of being in Toronto. There are so much to choose from. However, after stumbling across Salad Days that was closed earlier in Yorkville, I came across this location by chance when looking for the food court at Yonge  and Bloor. I looked around the food court first but this place won by freshness and value. I tried the special as it offered a lot of variety and Mediterranean options. I love Greek food so it was a great choice. I was happy with the quantity and quality of my salad, and smoke salmon. However, the dressing and sweet potato were bland. If it had more flavor,  I'd easily give it 4.75."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets because the price for the quantity is actually redick. Cobb salad....small...4.20.... if you check my pic you will see the size of this so called \"small\" salad..... I will never buy take out salad again from anywhere else but this place. The line up can get crazy but the people that work there are speedy gonzales styles and i just LOVE it. You can sub stuff in and out and there is no extra cost! like this place is wonders and other salad houses should take some tips (AHEM FRESHII) And if your thinking of going to Longo's and hitting there salad bar DONT DO IT cause its so not worth it. You can get 2 times that at this place for literally half the price. The Large salads here are actually unreal. I dont know how anyone finishes them. I also dont know how the place makes money, They are loading on the toppings....3 spoons full of Avacado.... like huh?? just wicked  you can get salads as wraps too and they have some soup...dont pass up this place. Its in cumberland terrace....if you enter from Yonge st go straight down the hall...its beside the soup place. If your in cumberland its on the top floor."}
{"text":"Avoid lunch hour RUSH... if you can.  Small space, don't go at noon if your claustrophobic! Great prices and the quality of food is excellent.  Salad house is better though... and what's with the music!?  Celine Dion, etc...  Bad enough you gotta wait in that line, the choice of music is atrocious."}
{"text":"Great portion, the small Cobb salad is a healthy portion for $5.60 taxes in. Chicken, avocado, egg, feta cheese, olives, tomato, corn, romaine. Clean and fast service! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has FRESH tasty salads for CHEAP  The place use to be called Salad House when the old management was around. To be honest you get a lot of food regardless, but the old management was WAY better.  You can get a delicious filling small cobb salad for under $5.00!"}
{"text":"I frequent this salad place as it is conveniently located by Yonge-Bloor station.  Tip: There is normally a line-up, so it's better to go off-peak hours or pre-order online via an app.  This salad bar offers a variety of fresh ingredients for you to build your own salad, or choose some of their specialties. Starting at $4, up to $9. The lunch special costs $6.49 for a decently sized greek salad with chicken/salmon, sweet potatoes, stuffed vine leaves, and olives.  A good mix of protein and greens, leaving you full and satisfied. I recommend adding proteins, more egg, beans, etc.  Healthy and affordable, ideal for lunch. If you're looking for salad, try this place out!"}
{"text":"This salad place has everything going for it...a beautiful array of fresh ingredients, generous portions and great prices. My favourite is the Cobb with feta cheese (you get a choice of feta or blue)...and I love the fact that it comes with sweet corn, which is not a typical Cobb ingredient (but should be). Personally I find the small size perfectly filling.   If you're in a salad mood this is definitely a good bet for takeout or to enjoy in the food court nearby."}
{"text":"The best value for a lunch anywhere near here. I love this place and will continue to be a regular here. The small salads are the perfect size for a lunch.   The lines get crazy at lunch on weekdays so allow yourself an extra 10 min if you're planning on going here.   The fattoush salad is amazing (if you're extra hungry, ask for extra pita in it for only 76 cents extra.)   The Cobb salad is another favourite of mine.   I've never had a bad lunch here. Service is quick and friendly. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great salads. Big with the local business crowd during the work week. Try to get there before 11:30/11:40 for faster service.   5/5*"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this salad bar through the help of my trusty Yelp app and the pictures alone were enough to get me salivating. Sure enough today I made it a mission to get my mom and grandma in the car and drive down to the bustling corner of yonge and bloor. I found the take out salad bar on the first level of Cumberland Terrace shopping center tucked a bit back right at the front of the little food court.  Because of the pictures and reviews I felt like I had almost been here before but nothing prepared me for the 3 stuffed containers of goodness I was about to receive.    I ordered one large Cobb, busting with cubed veggies, avocado, hard boiled egg, corn, a full seasoned chicken breast, and sprinkled with feta and olives...$7.49. Then I decided on the special which came with Greek salad base, puréed sweet potato, avocado, chicken breast, corn, 2 mini stuffed spinach rolls, and tahini....$5.49! Lastly, I decided to be advent little spontaneous a made my own custom salad consisted of spinach and iceberg lettuce, corn, cucumber + tomatoes, asparagus, and avocado, all for $5.30 then opted on smoked salmon for an additional $1!  The staff behind the counter were fast and served heaping amounts of each item. Also they sprinkled the dressing very lightly which kept it crisp and healthy.  I walked away with a heavy bag of goodies and the biggest grin from ear to ear. This place was THE loophole, it was like that shortcut in Mariocart on the rainbow level. I mean how does the world not know bout this place?   Anyways, I hopped back in the car and we drove home to eat since there is no such thing as parking in yorkville. I put the salads all in a giant salad bowl and served up some of each to each person. The amount of food could have easily fed four but we missioned through the entire confection and were healthily stuffed.  There's no other place in the city to get such quality and customized salads in the quantity they're dishing out...and the prices are just unreal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Salad Days...WOW.... I love you :)   I work across the street and I can't believe after a year I'm finding this now..  Ordered the cobb salad based on the yelp reviews and it was delicious. Generous portions of fresh ingredients with a nice light vinaigrette dressing. The small came to a little over 5 dollars and I think it weighted over a pound.   I asked for no egg with the cobb and was delighted when the gentleman making my salad asked if I wanted to sub for something else, instead of just excluding the egg and giving me the salad as is.   Without a doubt I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"So much salad for cheap price!  This place literally just became my top one place to get fresh salad.  I got one small size cob salad, only $4.95 before tax. And the ingredients are super fresh and we'll prepared. I love here."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I always get the Cobb salad (with blue cheese and honey Dijon salad dressing.) A small is more than enough for a regular eater, and at less than $5 you seriously can't go wrong. Ever since Yelp sent me here (thank you Yelp app!) salads from other places never compare in value. I'm always like \"ummmm yeah....I could get that from Salad Days for half the price AND it comes with chicken.\"   The owner (I think he's the Owner? The man who runs the cash register?) is so sweet too. The first time I was here, the lady in front of me didn't know it was cash only and was about to leave when he said \"no no no,  order and pay me tomorrow.\" A nice mom-and-pop touch-- not typical of what you'd expect in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Great salads!! This is one of my favourite lunch spots just down the street from work. I look for every excuse to come here. My usual is the Cobb salad with extra cheese. The mashed sweet potato is also a nice treat. A great healthy alternative from the usual fast food lunch offerings."}
{"text":"This place is good, fresh salad at a good price. It's always packed at lunch, and they have great options for a salad. Sometimes they have live music playing which is a bit intense.  When I went there was no line (early for lunch around 11am and also there was a massive road closure including to foot traffic) so I got my food fast, but it was unclear I was had the option to change toppings if I wanted to. Smoked Salmon daily special only had 3 slices of smoked salmon, which was not that much given the size of the actual salad."}
{"text":"Salad days was my go to place until today. I walked in and wondered why, at 12 noon there wasn't a huge line up as always! I figured it out when the lady behind the counter told me my $9 salad with salmon is now $15!!  A 6 dollar increase?! I will not be going back and by the looks of the empty store, no one else is either!"}
{"text":"Great salad place in Cumberland Terrace. This is by no means gourmet, but everything is fresh and the portions are very fair. I had a small Cobb salad and was satisfied with the taste and the amount. I'm glad to discover this place, as it's in a little bit of a food dead zone. This will be my go-to when I need a quick inexpensive lunch around Yorkville."}
{"text":"yeah super delish salads are here!!!! The line was short, the price was awesome, and the salad was super fresh!  I love beets, and they hooked me up with them- gotta love that!  I would love to go here again when we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Had the Cobb salad as there are too many options.  The staff behind the counter forgets that not everyone knows how the system works.  My wife tried to order a custom salad but it was difficult to communicate.  Bottom line the food was excellent.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love the salads here! After trying it, I finally get why there is always such a looooonnnnnng long line out the door. The salad bar and also the daily specials and menu items are all priced really well. I tried the veggie pita thinking it was just a pita with some cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes in it but it was loaded with 8-9 items including corn, avocado, hummus, couscous... it was under $6 and so filling and fresh. Best of all? SO DARN TASTY! I wish I lived / worked closer to this place. Totally love."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place, all I have to say is: -Affordable -Large portions -Great Food -Flexible -Fast  What else can you ask for during the Lunchtime rush?? If you work in the area you must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Salad days is a great healthy option for lunch and dinner. I've tried their salads and menu options during the lunch time rush when there is always an extremely long line-up, and also for dinner, closer to their closing time. I'd have to say that their food is of higher quality earlier in the day, and by dinner time, it's usually the leftover salad, and chicken, and they quickly run out of salmon fillets. I have to mention though that the consistency of the chicken breast is a bit off, as it tastes a bit rubbery and 'manufactured'.  The staff are very pleasant and efficient, and the prices are reasonable, especially for their generous portions. I will most definitely come here again, but probably for lunch rather than dinner."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good salad reasonable priced .  Guess that's why the line up is like crazy and people are rave about it . Had the lunch special that is with Greek salad and either smoke salmon / grilled chicken vine wrap and some tahini sauce and yogurt with cucumber sauce and two scoped mashed sweet potatoes . Also you can substitute ingredients you are dislike.  They do have a great selection of greens and variety to choose from . You could even make your own salad . But the thing is it's poorly executed without tossing and seasoning just pile of ingredients layer on top one of the other so I won't give credit to the flavor.  Flavor combination is poorly paired . I can hardly think of tahini go with smoke salmon. There are two locations in the same area . The one in the subway looks fresher it's new and people always line up for it .    Salad is always overpriced in most fine dining restaurants but I have to say they do put more care in constructing it both flavor wise and the presentation"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a salad, this is the place for you! They have a large selection of toppings to compliment whatever greens you feel like eating that day.  The price is exceptional and the staff REALLY try to stuff the box full for you. They tend to get quite busy during lunch but they serve very fast. I am impressed that they hire about 6 staff to work in a 250 sq ft area to speed up the process, a great reflection on management's commitment to fast service. This is especially important in an office and residential concentrated neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love that there are plenty of veggies to choose from at an okay price, I just didn't like how the staff gave me grief and tried to charge me more when I asked to get a too go box for my wrap. The wraps can get messy so I eat them with forks. They wouldn't even let me use one of their soup cups, I just didn't want dirty hands but instead I got a bunch of dirty looks"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and it was quite busy. The moment we got into the store, it smelled amazing - like fresh veggies and feta, so I was really excited. The line moved quickly and I ordered a chicken wrap since I thought their 2 salad sizes either wouldn't remotely fill a child or would feed a family of 4. As a first time patron, I was confused by their topping system. It was loud with a lot of staff and customers talking at the same time so I couldn't hear what the staff preparing my wrap said half the time. The toppings were in sections but on the menu there was no indication of what you can or cannot add, or if some were for a fee. I requested some and think the staff said no so I think they were maybe premium stuff that I didn't pay for. I would have preferred to select everything then pay for it all...Chicken was added last to my wrap and it was slightly toasted.  The wrap ended up very stuffed but the fillings were not evenly distributed at all. I had at leading half the wrap stuff with only romaine - many bites of dry romaine with no form of sauce or dressing at all. The chicken was dry and not very tasty. I tried a bit of friend's salad and that tasted amazing. I wish their quality would be more consistent."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait in the longest line ever. And because i wanted to try a little of all of their ingredients, i decided to customize my salad. overloaded with healthy yumminess it is absolutely scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"Great Salad! :)   Service was great and the meal was even better! If you're on a diet and looking for a solid meal, The Salad House is the place to go."}
{"text":"The salads are excellent and fresh and prepared right in front of you. The Tuna Salad wrap was a deliciously basic tuna wrap. Not too much going on, but perfectly executed."}
{"text":"Note:  This location underground, just beside Bloor Stn. as you head towards the food court has different hours than the Cumberland location.    There's NO dine-in, it's take-out only.  Quick, cheap, and healthy takeout assembly-line salad place!    I got their \"Special\" which was just under-$7 and it was pretty good.  IF you do not specify though as to what kinda greens/protein you want, they'll just give you iceberg lettuce + chicken.  \"Special\" comes with a bed of lettuce, 2 dolmades, 2 scopes of mashed sweet potatoes, 2 scopes of tuna/chicken/or some other kind of protein.  Great stop if you're looking for something quick, cheap, and healthy!  Next time I'll try their Cobb Salad."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food, healthy and super affordable. I've changed jobs and have moved out of the downtown financial district. I was asking around the office for something healthy and cheap and was given directions to Salad Days. Along the way I realised I'd eaten here once before and remembered loving their salad - so much provided for so little.  I was feeling like some carbs so got the Chicken Cobb pita wrap which was huge for $7.60, I was able to eat half then and the other half later.  Service was friendly and quick, I thought it might have been quick due to me arriving at 11:30am, however I went back today around 12:30 (I'm so bad at bringing lunch to work!) and the line was out the door, yet I didn't wait more than 5 minutes to be served. I had the lunch special Greek salad with mashed sweet potato and two vine leaves - another winner. I don't think you can go wrong at this place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for fresh and delicious salad for a great price. The small Cobb salad is $6.10 after tax, filling enough for lunch with the option to substitute toppings. I usually opt out olives and feta/blue cheese for chickpeas and mangos. The small Cobb is seasoned with house lemon vinaigrette which really makes the salad especially tasty. As for protein, I really like the taste of their chicken, just wish they gave a bit more..you can never have too much chicken.. (: Both small and large Cobb salads only comes with half of an egg though. If you want a whole boiled egg make sure you choose it as one of your substitutes forgoing another ingredient.   I eat the small Cobb salad at least 2 times a week, I would definitely recommend salad days. Stop buying pre-packaged dry, old salad from picnic, Starbucks or even bloor street market. Salad days at Bloor/yonge is where it's at.   Additional tip: Salad Days Cumberland is a bit cheaper- $5.60 for the small Cobb salad. I don't know why pricing is different, but I prefer this location for their friendly staff and the freshness of their salad."}
{"text":"- Consistent quality with cheap and healthy options  - Large selection of toppings - Avoid lunch time rush  - Great service. They're okay with you substituting items - Go to item : Cobb salad"}
{"text":"I didn't want to believe how good this place was. I didn't want to even entertain the thought....And then I ha their Fatoush salad. HOLY CRAP.   I usually throw a protein in there (Salmon) just to get a more complete meal but to get that for under $10. How can one complain. Fresh food, Great tasting food!  I'm a Salad Days convert.....join us....one of us! One of US! ONE OF US!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Cobb salad here. Lettuce, corn, chicken, avocado, olives, cheese, tomatoes.... All heaping and all for $4.75!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken lunch special is my jammy jam. Jam all night on that salad. After the price increase on their whole menu, going there is a little less exciting for my wallet, but when I am craving a zesty & filling salad, S days sets me right the heck up. For 6.75 clams you get some kick butt crispy fresh lettuce, cubed cucumbers and tomato, two dolma's, two ice cream sized scoops of mashed sweet potatoes, generous dollops of feta cheese, humus, tzatziki, a medium sized piece of their signature spiced chicken breast, and dressed with a nice home-made vinaigrette.   I went their yesterday after realized I haven't eaten a single vegetable for nearly two weeks, and realized I needed to stave off scurvy, so I RAN, not walked to salad days. Fore some reason, their chicken that day, which is usually flavourful and midlly spiced was covered in chilli flakes and nearly made me choke. But the humus and tzatziki balanced things out for the most part. And now I wont get scurvy. SCHWING."}
{"text":"A favoirite take out place for lunch.  Their salads are always fresh and chicken is always juicy.  Service is always quick even though their line up is ALWAYS out the door and coils around the corner and down their doorway."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, and filling  I got the small cobb salad and they filled the container so much that it almost spilled out when I lifted the lid. It tasted great and I was very satisfied for just $5.  The store is very small and kind of hidden within the building. Just follow signs to the food court once you get inside and you'll find it across Esther's Soup Kitchen.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that Salad Days finally opened at the Hudson's Bay Centre. But what really had me jumping from joy were their hours. They are open from 10am-7pm Monday to Saturday! Don't fret, the 2 Bloor location is still open, but they close at 4pm and are closed on weekends. I hated never being able to get food from Salad Days because my office is too far away to get it for lunch, and they closed too early to get a salad after work. But now I can get my fix after I finish work or on a Saturday! Funny, but I bought a small cobb salad today from them even though I am not hungry. Since they were open, I just had to! Also, they take debit and credit cards! And the portions are still amazing!!  **HaPpY DaNcE**"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The staff is friendly, efficient and professional. And the food! For $5 I always order the small cobb salad and it always surprises with me how liberal they are with their ingredients. They always give you a generous amount of chicken, feta, avocado and in my case, sweet potato puree (I always ask for the sweet potato puree instead of the hard boiled egg). One afternoon I decided to take the salad from the small take-out container and put it on a plate. It barely fit on a regular size plate! It was overflowing!!!  When in the area for lunch you have to check them out. Sadly their hours are kinda crap--they are not open for dinner. I am not sure if they are open on weekends? Anyone know?"}
{"text":"Salad Days offers affordable salads made with fresh ingredients in very generous portions. However, I personally prefer a smaller salad with lots of different ingredients over one that is of a larger quantity and abundant with mixed greens. I thought the salads here were just OK.  Smoked Salmon Salad - Large piece of smoked salmon - Lots and lots of greens underneath - Aside from the salmon, the rest of the salad is pretty simple with slices of tomatoes and bell peppers. I personally like cherry tomatoes and ingredients like edamame, nuts, roasted veggies etc in my salads, so if you're like me, this might not be the best option for you  Chicken Special - The chicken was cooked well so it wasn't dry and the vine leaves were great - The hummus and tatziki drowned the salad not to mention there was also feta on top; this was a little heavy for my taste so I didn't eat too much more of this one. I'd suggest asking for the sauces on the side instead!  Tuna Wrap - Lots of veggies - I preferred this wrap to the salads  I'd skip this place for my salad days, but it could be a good option for a wrap day!"}
{"text":"AMAZING value! For $5 they are so generous with the portions of salad and wraps. The falafel wrap is the best I've had! It's no wonder this place is so busy during the lunch hour, extremely reasonably priced compared to other nearby (and overpriced) places like Freshii."}
{"text":"Always fresh, inexpensive,  healthy option  for lunch"}
{"text":"It takes about 15 minutes for human skin to freeze in -18 degrees weather and I've suffered through this walk again and again during lunchtime to enjoy their awesome salads. The cob salad is my favourite - fresh avocados, greens, corn, and everything in between. They also have this kick ass lunch special - Greek salad, vine leaves, sweet potato mash, and your choice of chicken or salmon for $5.99. You get such a hefty pile of food for the lunch and it makes me feel less guilty for eating carbs at dinner. The hours are so much better here than Cumberland Court, and they take debt/credit!  The queue is a bit long during lunch, but they zip through really quickly and it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ok so Salad Days is pretty legendary when it comes to serving a cheap and healthy meal so once I happened upon the newish location inside Hudson Bay concourse I was pretty stoked.   Unfortunately this location isn't up to par with the service, quality and reliability of the original location inside Cumberland Terrace and here's why  -service is a crap shoot especially whenever the owner isn't around to oversee the \"salad tossers\" if you happen upon here after 4 or 5pm there's some semblance of organized chaos and good luck getting your order just right as the staff often have a look of bewilderment in their eyes. At least they are polite, but the lack of training attention to detail and organization clearly shows when the boss isn't around  -the quality isn't really \"Market Fresh\" like the menu states...I've been ordering the chicken salads and wraps on a regular basis and over the course of a month the chicken has gone from chewy/flakey (dare I say normal?) to soft and rubbery, like poultry jello yuck!! Seriously is Salad Days using fake rubber chickens from the nearby Dollarama to supplement their supply because it tastes disgusting, it's worse tasting than any McChicken or Subway fake overprocessed frozen chicken bullshit, just terrible!  On the upside this location has a nice green striped walls...It's a 2 from me"}
{"text":"Wow Salad House you are the shizz!  Located inside the nearly derelict Cumberland Terrace, you'll know you're getting close once you see all the folks walking around happily clutching a white styrofoam container with greens just brimming out the sides. Considering this is Yorkville, the Salad House is not at all fancy it's more like a small salad shack that dishes out the greens cafeteria style.  The small custom salad I ordered which consisted of my choice of greens (mad spinach yo) plus 4 toppings (chick peas, tomato, cucumber and avocadoes) was so abundant the lid of my container would not close!  The best part is that I could choose the premium greens that I wanted instead of just the regular mix of 5 scant spinach leaves and a motherload of the pasty iceberg lettuce (cough,cough...Freshii) that other saladeries stingily dish-out.  If I could critique one thing about Salad House, it's that it'd be nice if they had edamame beans, having said that the chick peas and navy beans are plentiful here.  Service is fast and efficient, and even if the salad tossers look like they just got a hall pass from the Don Jail, I cannot hate on Salad House as all this glorious vegetable-age only cost me a fiver! Big-up to the fellow Yelpers that have previously sounded off about the awesomeness of the Salad House. I challenge anyone to find a better deal in the Yorkville area for a decent lunch that costs about 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"I'm quite a regular here!!! I love everything available here. Don't get discouraged about how long the line is as the employees work fast!! Love the Fatoush salad & the Cob salad is amazing. I also love the tuna wrap...very filling!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is so close to my work and I never knew about it.  Here I was eating $10 salads from Freshii like a sucka.  Well, no more!  Checked out The Salad House located at Yonge/Bloor inside the Cumberland Terrace (on the ground floor) facing Cumberland Street.  We arrived shortly after 12:30pm and there was a line of about 15-20 people ahead of us but we willing to wait.  If there was this many people in line, it's gotta be good!  The line moved quicky and once we got closer to the counter, the space inside the acual store was pretty tight.  We ordered the small caprese salad ($4.00 w/tax) and the small apple beet salad ($4.19).  After paying for the salad, I was told they were out of the cheese for the caprese salad so I went with the Greek.  They jam a generous amount of toppings of cucumbers, tomatoes and green/red peppers on top of the lettuce and spooned in about 4 heaping spoonfuls of feta cheese.  I was impressed!  As for the apple beet salad, there was about 3/4 of a Granny Smith apple in there!  A wonderful lunch option in the area.  $10 salads be damned!"}
{"text":"I never thought that I would pay for salad, but this place changed my mind. You can see the line and the fans during lunch service, which loops 3 times outside the place. However, the line moves very quick, as their skilled servers are pros and will get your salad to you with remarkable speed. And really, you can't beat the price. Though they have recently raised their prices around $0.50 across the board, you can still get the lunch special for under $7.50. This is a long styrofoam box stuffed with an assortment of greens, sweet potato mash, vine leaf wraps, scoops of tzatziki and hummus, and your choice of chicken or salmon. Of course, you can get their other salads too or build your own. When I worked near, we came here 2-3 times/week. Amazing value and super healthy."}
{"text":"the salad special is incredible! it's a great affordable option for those of us who have no time to cook, ate out few too many times in a week and need something nutritious to balance out what we've done to our bodies ;) not mention  it is soooo delicious!!!! The line moves fast but i use ritual to get points, and get in and out of the place in under a minute =P!!"}
{"text":"There's always a line during lunch. Always! Luckily, it moves fast and there's lots of regulars who know how to order with as few words as possible.  What I love: - A filling lunch that's fresh and I don't feel ridiculous after. - The lunch special (currently) is Greek Salad with grilled chicken/salmon, sweet mashed potato, and stuff grape leaves for $~7!! - You can substitute ingredients (I like avocado rather than tomato)  Simple, fast, feel-good lunch!"}
{"text":"Cheap and healthy and I love how they don't charge extra for avocado!!!  There's a line up during lunches but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a lunch place around where I work, and in checking out the Yelp reviews for one restaurant, someone commented saying Salad House and Salad Days are some of the best places for salad.   I looked up Salad House first, but turns out they have long lines at lunch, and also accept only cash (which I wasn't carrying). I turned my attention to Salad Days, and my problems were solved when I saw that they're on Ritual. Not only does that mean I can pay through card, but also that I wouldn't have to wait in line for my order.  I ordered a small Cobb salad on Ritual, and it was ready when I got there. There was a line-up, so I'm pretty glad I was able to order ahead. You can also call and have them prepare the order, and it usually takes under 5 minutes.   It's worth it to note that I'm really not much of a salad eater, but I really enjoyed this one. It was a blend of great flavours, they had plenty of chicken - I also added salmon for just $1.45. One of the best parts was that they didn't hold back on the avocado, and it lasted the entire meal. Even though I ordered the small salad, which comes in small box as well, don't be deceived by the outward appearance of the box. I emptied the salad out on a plate, and it filled the entire plate - I was definitely full by the end. I just got the lemon vinaigrette dressing, and that gave it plenty of flavour.   Service: 5/5 Speed: 5/5 Accuracy of order: 5/5 Avocado helping: 5/5 Price: 5/5 (just over $6 for the salad, unreal)"}
{"text":"The OG salad joint in the Yonge and Bloor neighbourhood. The lineups at lunch time used to be like someone's worst Disney World nightmare, but when they opened a second location underground across the street, things improved greatly! Still, if you can, aim for just before 12 to miss peak lunch rush.  Salads are big and reasonably priced. Lots of toppings if you're a salad customizer. Not me though, I'm a sucker for a good Cobb and don't often venture outside of that (but the lunch special is a decent alternative for cheap!). Or maybe a wrap is more your thing? I like a good wrap, and have enjoyed the Cobb wrap when I've thought \"I'll take my salad rolled up in an edible carpet today, please!\"  They're very accommodating of topping swaps if that's your thing, too. If you're trying to eat healthier and don't want to spend your life savings on some kale, Salad Days is as good a place as any!"}
{"text":"Love this quick place! Line is usually very long but the service is so nice and food is fresh and large-portioned for cheap price!"}
{"text":"Went here to grab a quick salad.  For only a couple of buck you get a freshly made salad.  Can either select from a menu or design your own. Had the cobb salad and it was delicious!  Would definitely go back.  Usually long lines but I got lucky the day I went.  Everything looked really fresh and there were no yucky bits!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! After hearing all about it from Yelp friends, I decided to check it out myself!  After a good ten minutes looking for this place, I finally found it - & boy am I glad I did!  I got a small Cobb salad. The ingredients looked super fresh (no wonder- they probably run out after each rush) and they stuffed my box full of veggie and chicken goodness!!  At less than 5 dollars you really can't go wrong! It was super delicious and beats any other 'salad' places out of the park!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Yup, I come here for my salad fixes which is basically 2-3 times a week.  At $5.30 for a small cobb salad (which trust me, most of the time fills 86% of most people until dinner rolls around), it's a good deal.  Yes, some may say, whatever they're doing you can do it at home.  Which is true, and for $5.30 to some it might seem ridiculous AND prices have gone up from the past.  But I guess to this one sucker here who doesn't have the time to normally cook at home or prepare a lunch, I'm a fan.  So here's my $5.30, I don't mind being a labelled a 'sucka.'  Note: Feel free to ask to substitute certain options for others.  For an example, don't want cheese, you can ask for beets instead."}
{"text":"Best salad place in the city hands down!   I love Salad Days, ever since i changed jobs and had to leave the Yonge and Bloor area, I've been missing my amazing, healthy and affordable lunch.  I'm thrilled that their new location is open late.  Great portions, great taste, great value, what more could you want!  And kudos to the staff who just helped me tonight, thanks for the amazing service!  Bring one to the downtown core please near the ACC!"}
{"text":"Amazing custom salads for $5! And in Yorkville! The box they put it in may seem small but they CRAM IT FULL! Don't believe me? Empty the contents onto a dinner plate or into big salad bowl - you won't be disappointed!  There is always a huge lunch line but it's worth it. Your belly and wallet will be grateful."}
