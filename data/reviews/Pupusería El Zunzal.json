{"text":"I've ordered two things here and I've waited for almost an hour. I know there's five people working, but it they are not busy, there was 4 tables, one of the tables got their food and the lady was passing shrimp cocktails to a party of 5. When you are hungry, don't stop here."}
{"text":"I came for my lunch break to get some pupusas ,they were really greasy customer service was really bad girl gave me attitude because i asked for forks,wont be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Food is alright, costumer service is the worst. The waitress and the cashier were both rude, they make you feel as if they're bother if you need anything. Worst waitress I've ever dealt with. Would probably order take out, but I won't be eating at that place."}
{"text":"One of the best places for pupusas. Quick to make the food and FRESH!! You can't beat their deals either."}
{"text":"horrible service. horrible smell., the bathroom had no air freshener. no refills on water?!!?!?!?!?!   brought in coupon and they still made us pay full price.  no other customers there and the place looks like shit but they have $30,000 security system!?  i now know why everyone hates salvadorians"}
{"text":"So far we had only order pupuas, the ones that are mix 12 for 12 $ .  They are delicious ! We order them over the phone and we never had any issues with this place . Yeah they don't speak really good English but I don't mind  . my fiance don't speak Spanish  , he always picks up the order and never had any problem . My in laws love them too  despite the fact that they are (white ) No offense upon race comment . I'm Mexican and I love  pupusas and so they do.  It's hard not to ...  Every time they come from CA  we get them .  The place  looks run down but food is great . I would recomend this place over all  the other pupusa  places that they sell them so expensive  and they ain't that good."}
{"text":"Last week i visited this joint and ordered (2) dozen 'Pupusas Revueltas' which ran me around $26.50 after-tax, We had family visiting from out-of-state and thought it would be nice for them to taste some local Salvadorian food. Something that bothered me however was that upon picking them up, the women behind the counter gave me a rude look and were rolling their eyes at me as if i had inconvenienced them in some sort of way - meanwhile the cashier was laughing at some inside joke etc. I personally didn't care but maybe they should try being friendlier to paying customers since we are the reason their business is open.   Nevertheless i arrived home and we began eating these Pupusas and they were great, Very cheesy and meaty and flavorful. The curtido included was spicy and had bits of jalapeno which i enjoyed since it gave it a nice kick, I'm not a big fan of having tomato sauce with my Pupusas so i ignored the sauce - I can say that i'll happily continue visiting this joint and ordering more Pupusas regardless of how many stares, whispers or eye-rolling i get :) Who knows maybe next time i'll order (4) dozen and invite the entire family to eat Pupusas.   See you soon..."}
{"text":"Awesome food... I went here to pick up a plate of food to go. If u don't mind waiting a bit for your food to be done, this is a must. The pupusas are the beat in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pupusas here are just okay- they have a takeout special for 12/$12 but if you're not feeding an army, they'll run you anywhere from 99cents each (no specified filling?) or $2/each for the revueltas (my preferred flavor).   Not located in the best area, but cozy enough inside, I found that staff do speak English despite reviews to the contrary. However, 20 minutes to receive 2 takeout pupusas seemed to be a bit much. Oh, and they charge $1 credit card service fee. Order was hot and greasy, but filling was minimal and pupusas seemed doughier? Didn't really care for them, but might keep the $12 bag in mind the next time I'm invited to a potluck."}
{"text":"This place has the best pupusas special!!! They also have other international dishes. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Love love pupusas"}
{"text":"The place itself looks a little run down. But the service was great. I placed an order over the phone for some pupusas. She told me it would be a 10 minute wait. Which to me was perfect. I got there and the place looked a little dirty. I don't know, it could've been all the bright colors they had going on. Any way I liked their food. It had good taste. It could've had a bit more meat but whatever."}
{"text":"Since the eastside seems to get all the good pupusa action, I was excited to see a new Salvadoran spot closer to my part of town. I was even more excited when I stopped in and found a menu featuring many central American specialties, in addition to the famous pupusa. To be honest, the first thing that attracted me to this place was its name. I liked the sound of the word \"zunzal,\" and wanted to know what it meant. It turns out to be a popular surfing destination in El Salvador (sometimes spelled \"sunzal,\" but clearly more fun with two z's), and this restaurant shows its beach inspiration with a menu of many seafood creations.    I was greeted in Spanish as I entered and approached the counter. Standing at the counter, you have a full view of the kitchen. The service was extremely friendly and welcoming, so I can highly recommend this place to anyone, even if you don't possess basic Spanglish skills! I did not try to communicate in English, so if you're sensing a language barrier, I'm sure you can get by with a point-and-order simply by pointing at the menu. Or, even better, lose the intimidation and ask for \"la especialidad de la casa\" and let them cook for you. For vegetarians, I recommend the pupusas stuffed with cheese and loroco. Native to El Salvador, loroco is a little green flower of herbaceous character. It's a veggie pupusa! These are served with the standard accompaniments, a mildly spiced tomato sauce and some quality curtido (crisp, vinegary cabbage slaw). I noticed a few flavors of atol on a specials board and ordered an atol de piña, just to try something different. Very comforting in cold weather, atoles are warm, starch-thickened beverages, often flavored with chocolate, corn, or fruits and infused with spices. The atol de piña was very good, with plenty of pineapple and cinnamon flavor. I would order it again.  The outdated building has housed many different restaurants over the years. You may notice a drive-thru lane outside, but it is presently not in service.  One wall in the dining area welcomes you to \"Gringo's,\" and a neon-lighted ceiling box in the center of the room reminds me of a party room in a 1980s roller rink. There's a TV passing telenovelas and possibly soccer games, in addition to a very loud jukebox full of Vicente Fernandez albums. I was flipping through the jukebox as I waited for my takeout order (say \"para llevar\") when a random selection started blaring over the speakers. Why do these sneaky machines always trick me into revealing my apparent affection for ranchera standards? I feel safe that my closet full of enormous sombreros is still a secret."}
{"text":"Bad Service. Bad Food. My boyfriend ordered a kolashampan and they were flat. Ugly interior with a sign that says Welcome To Gringo's. I ordered the plantains with cream and beans. These were the most watered down beans I ever had. Horrible. My boyfriend's egg had runny oil. Ugh. I wish I had a warning."}
{"text":"Horrible service. There's no menu on the walls or some sort of hint as to what they serve. I had to ask for a paper menu. She looked at me like I was crazy when I asked her for the menu. She automatically assumed I knew what was going on in there which I didn't. Waited about 20 min for 4 pupusas which were okay but not enough content inside. You would think they would invest in the esthetics of their store and the quality of their food rather than the expensive surveillance system they have. The sitting area was dirty you can tell no effort is out in their cleaning and it doesn't feel like they give one crap about the way their restaurant looks. I'm sure if they cared they would be getting better reviews on here."}
{"text":"I wish there was a NO STARS option. DO NOT COME HERE! I came with a Restaurant.com gift certificate and they had the nerve to tell me that Restaurant.com is a fraudulent company and that they won't accept my gift certificate because its a SCAM! I for one know that Restaurant.com is a legit company that I have used several times. Their restaurant has been featured on their site for years, which i proceeded to show my waitress on my phone, but she had no response.  money is tight with a baby on the way and we only went there because i had this certificate. My husband ordered because he was starving, but i refused to eat or drink anything from this establishment because they are the ones that are FRAUDULENT!  These people are shady and food is mediocre at best, hardly any filling in the pupusas and the wait is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I ordered 6 pupusas to go. After an hour of waiting I finally asked the lady, \"are my pupusas almost ready?\" She seemed bothered that I asked. I know theres sings all over the restaurant saying they make fresh food and it is NOT a fast food place. That's is why the restaurant looks tacky. Anyway, after I asked, she brought me the pupusas right away. So that means, the pupusas were ready she just wasn't giving them to me? Honestly if I wouldn't have asked she wouldn't have given them to me. I was sitting right in front of her I don't know how she have forgotten. I get home I cut the pupusa (beans and cheese) in half and it oozed out with oil. There was sooo much oil it was soupy sitting on the plate. I was so grossed out I threw it in the trash. This restaurant has bad service and nasty food."}
{"text":"Good food. They don't speak English though and the little menus by the window are in Spanish too! Good food would have given more stars if they spoke English. You get a basket of chips and salsa. The sweet sauce in the squirt bottle was good on the pupusa so was the spicy cabbage slaw stuff. I would recommend buying the dozen special which gives you 12 for $12. We ordered two number ones each."}
{"text":"Great food. I should of listen more in school to speak Spanish because the whole staff don't speak English. Very friendly staff and great food. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Best pupusas in town, love the homemade food, all the food is original and owner blanquita is overlooking the coking, their tamales de elote are just done perfect and all of there food is made very original, it does take about 15 to 20 minutes to get your order but it's the real deal! el salvador food original got to try it thanks"}
{"text":"99 cent pupusas brought me in the girl working the counter was cute and helpful... Food was decent cmon  its not filet mignon you are getting at this price point"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place could have done a lot better at everything.The wait was very long. I had to wait more than an hour to get my one order of pupusas. The food was ok. I've had better. The place was not clean. There was a bunch of napkins and bottle caps on the floor and the chairs had food on them."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. Their ensalada is surprisingly good, but very disappointed with their chips and salsa. The salsa was flavorless and the chips were stale. Pupusas had no flavor whatsoever. Tasted like masa and that's it. The sauce for the pupusas was watery and not great. The building overall was nice and clean but could use some upgrades. Needs much improvement."}
{"text":"This place had the grossest Pupusas I have ever in my life experienced! Yuck. Skip it."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad, and more bad. This place is just awful in every aspect. It's an old joint located on Decatur Blvd. The venue is really old and outdated, we wasn't sure if they were trying to go for a specific theme or not, but it sure look awful. The menu is a little bit all over the place. We weren't certain what was Salvadorean and what wad Mexican. After 30 minutes of waiting we finally received our food (I wish they never came out with any food at all) it was even more disappointed than the whole experience. I just cannot emphasize how bad the quality of everything was. From the chips and salsa to the main course - everything was just bad."}
{"text":"we ordered the cheese and the bean pupusas, they were fluffy and crunchy. bigger and tastier than others I've tried in vegas, they are made to order so it was a 20 minute wait. I can't wait to return and try some more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Most places have really small pupusas! But these were huge and so good! Reminds me of when my grandma used to make them. They have a 12/$12 everyday which is great!"}
{"text":"I wish I had come here sooner. There are a lot of negative reviews here and I can attest that most are complete bull. I ordered papusas, tacos, quesadillas & the breakfast with plantains. Everything was fabulous. Flavorful and fresh. I waited maybe ten, fifteen minutes, which is typical for a made to order restaurant, and I speak not a word of Spanish but the staff was awesome and didn't make me feel uncomfortable or out of place in any way. I plan on returning soon and often."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly, fast service the place wasn't too packed as I stopped by around 11am. The pupusas were somewhat thin and lacking cheese opposed to others I've eaten."}
{"text":"El lugar está muerto parece que está uno comiendo en la cocina del vecino está muy feo y aparte de todo te dan más mása que guisado en las Popusas. No pierdan su dinero en este lugar"}
{"text":"This place has such extremes in Yelp ratings so far.  In the light of those, here's my experience:  SERVICE:  the place was mostly empty, but service was solid;  timely;  not effusively ingratiating, but perfectly decent  PUPUSAS et. al.:  Enjoyable revueltos pupusa;  the masa did not have the rich corn fragrance that is the hallmark of great pupusas to me, and the cheese was a bit odd;  but the nice crunch outside and lovely goop inside was fun to eat.  Had a chipilin tamale and it was all right.   The slaw that comes with the pupusa was light on flavor, but the weak vinegary/sweet squeeze bottle sauce helped.  SALSA:  I thought the little dish of salsa served with the chips was a highlight - - it is a light, thin concoction, but with onion and cilantro that was so fragrant, I was drinking it out of the cup.  OVERALL:  It was a nice bite to eat;  I'll keep my eyes open for Vegas pupusas that are more aromatic though."}
