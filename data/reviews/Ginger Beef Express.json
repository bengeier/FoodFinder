{"text":"Tried calling in an order Friday night because I assumed there would be a long wait. I recently came from Ontario and haven't changed my number yet. When I gave the lady my number she refused to place my order because I didn't have a local area code. Seemed a little ridiculous. She told me I'd have to come it but there is a 45 minute order wait time. She refused a customer because she doesn't want to incur long distance charges to call me back.  That $1 or maybe a bit more phone call cost her over $80 in food orders and I'm definitely not coming back due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"**WARNING** Please consider your health before eating here. I ordered a chicken dish a month ago and within an hour of eating it my stomach started doing backflips. Just over an hour after eating I had my head in the toilet bowl and was violently ill. For the next 48-72 hours I was absolutely ruined. Everything I ate came out either my mouth or the \"other way\". No attempt for compensation was made and I have made over a dozen attempts to contact management. None of my calls have been returned. He is apparently too busy to speak with me."}
{"text":"We're regular enough that the ladies and the front desk know my name. The food is not spectacular, but then this establishment doesn't pretend to be either. The food quality is consistent from visit to visit. Tasty North American style Chinese food. If you're in the center north part of Calgary and that's what your looking for, check this place out."}
{"text":"First time try their food, amazing!!! Ginger beef is excellent, as well as the chicken ball and lemon chicken. Don't forget to ask the $5 entree."}
{"text":"How I miss Calgarian Ginger Beef! Why are you Calgary based only?"}
{"text":"I get their beef chow meine all the time! Love the crispy noodles they use with this dish, I only get it once in a blue moon as it costs a lil over 10 bux just for one dish after tax. Overall for a take out place, the service is fast, people working there are friendly. If anyone want fast Chinese take out this is the place to go."}
{"text":"They forgot an item that I wanted the most. They didn't even notice because I didn't get any calls from them and I paid for it. I've always eaten Chinese Food before and their ginger beef is not good. No wonder there's ALWAYS no customers every time I pass by here. Tried this place once, NEVER coming back again."}
{"text":"This location is closed. They moved to MacEwan. Food is decent -to be expected usual Chinese fare. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Don't order from here if you want your order to be done right. The paper outlining our order was right, but the contents were missing one of our 5 dishes and another dish was completely wrong.

They agreed to deliver the missing and incorrect items, but when we called back an hour later they admitted they never sent any body...

Decent food, abysmal service."}
{"text":"The food is almost always spot on. It always shows up fast and hot. Great coupons on their website and friendly staff. A great place in the deep south for delivery or take out."}
{"text":"This is my local go-to Chinese takeaway place! I work every weekend and as a result, am often working tired/hungover and in need of Chinese food at the end of the day.

This place isn't open for lunch, but they open at 4pm which suits me just fine to grab a takeaway dinner on the way home. Best of all they have some combo deals which come with chicken fried rice, mixed veggies, a spring roll and a choice of four meat options for $9.95 plus tax or $12.95 plus tax for two meat options.

It's westernised Chinese but it's fresh, tasty, cheap and consistent. I've only had the combo with one option (mainly ginger beef but I also tried the honey garlic chicken) and it's always been great. Plus it comes in a foam container that separates the food.

I recommend phoning ahead as it always takes about 20 - 25 minutes for them to prepare."}
{"text":"They used to be good I ordered wonton soup and it's all vegetables carrots and zucchini and two tiny shrimp and one Tiny piece of chicken and no barbeque pork. I also ordered two other dishes and they gave me one package of soy sauce and they charged me 25 cents for hot sauce for my soup. Next time I'll go across 52nd St. and go to Emerald Palace"}
{"text":"I called about 6 and when it came time for me asking what options were available for the combo orders...the gal answering phone taking orders...said they don't have combos...only dinner for one...dinner for two....etc...I attempted to explain what a combo order was...perhaps 2 choices of various things like ginger beef and chop suey, etc with rice...nope I am told...no such thing as a combo order she said. I said I would call back when I had found their menu on line.  I did...surprise...surprise...there is indeed such a thing as a combo order...single...or double...that's hard to understand rather than just a combo order of a mixture of things???????  I call back...get two single combo orders and disappointed choices were so limited...only 4 choices of the \"meat\" and you get mixed veggies and fried rice...no substitutes...for $9.95.  Order two orders of dumplings aka pot stickers which we so like!  Its January 1st and I expected deliveries to be somewhat of a wait...and I am told an hour and a half...and was just a bit short of that time frame.  Combo orders or should I say \"single\" combo order was overflowing with rice!  Veggies were larger cut pieces but fresh and crisp.  Ginger beef was disappointing but sweet and sour chicken was nice and tender.  The dumplings might have been prepared last week...as they were less than fresh...tips of them were hard...and very little flavor to them.  Boo and hiss!!!!  Will have to be real hungry to order from them again..."}
{"text":"Great ginger beef, also nice and fast service which makes for a good option when you want some take-out.

Pretty standard fare as far as Chinese take-out, but I found it pretty good value and will use them again for sure."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good. Best Chinese you will find in this area or even the se. Bills Peking house is the closest in quality , take it from me I am experienced with Chinese cuisine.But remember if you want dine in bills would be my choice but for a quick take out craving this is your spot."}
{"text":"Busy night tonight for us so we got Asian take-out. (our go-to-food it seems!)
Small establishment, very clean. This business has just moved here possibly from Beddington. Friendly service and the food was ready within 20 min as promised on the phone.
We ordered the chicken chow mein, shrimp fried rice and wonton soup.
Everything was amazing, large portions, deelish.
We were very satisfied. Nothing was oversalted, nothing tasted greasy, all very fresh.
No seating, take-out and delivery only hence the EXPRESS in the title!
Honestly, the best fried rice I have found in a year and a half in Calgary.
Everything was $22, including 2 fortune cookies! (YUM)"}
{"text":"I think I forgot to mention that we ordered the chicken balls. Maybe that was when we ordered from them a second time! I do not recommend ordering the balls. They are very dense/heavy. I like a lighter, crunchier batter if I am going to eat anything deep fried (which is almost never). Just a tip! 
Still love this place dearly and we will order once a week or so. I love the veggie/seafood dishes! And the rice. And the soup. And the spring rolls. U get the idea!"}
{"text":"Food amazing. Second time ordering in past month but...
Comments about tips from delivery guy ( who drove one block) were so unacceptable i may never order again!!"}
{"text":"Ginger Beef, in my opinion, offers the best American-style takeout Chinese in the city. You won't be disappointed with the menu whatsoever. Obviously the ginger beef is great, and we also like the beef/black bean which comes with chunks of zucchini and other veggies. That said, their popularity has really exploded and it can be pretty difficult getting through to them to place can order sometimes. The phone will just ring and they'll hang up. I can't fault them for that; but perhaps hire more staff!

Do note that their cash discount doesn't apply to combo orders, orders with a coupon, OR delivery in fact. If you aren't big on spring rolls, then your best option for value is to order a couple of menu items and use one of the 99c coupons found on their website."}
{"text":"Best in town. Glad they are in the neighbourhood. Food is always fresh and their curry chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"We've been going to the location on Macleod for years, and this location is very comparable, especially for take out! Great to have decent takeout close to home"}
{"text":"Surprisingly poor food quality. The special chow mein was slimy and utterly without flavour, although the thick-noodle shanghai style was marginally better. I didn't dare try the shrimp in the chow mein. We ate half before it went in the garbage. The veggies were steamed to an unpleasant blandness. Fried rice was too dry, and rather thoughtless-seeming and plain with little inclusion beyond a bit of egg. 

For what must be their signature dish, the ginger beef was good, but it was poor consolation when the basics were so awful. I can't speak for other Ginger Beef locations, but it seems it's the type of place whose success hinges on dupes who've never had good Chinese. If you get a craving for chow mein, try the Szechuan shanghai at Golden National. 10/10 every time."}
{"text":"I have tried every Chinese restaurant in the area since I moved nearby but was disappointed. Finally this place opened and I received a flyer and decided to try. Food was fresh, not overly salty or loaded with MSG and not overly greasy. So it doesn't leave you sick and bloated. Great find!"}
{"text":"I'm being kind of generous with the one star. Lemon chicken was overcooked dried out inedible, satay beef and the beef and broccoli were tasteless, soy sauce wouldn't save them. I don't even know if that's real beef. It's really hard to tell though cuz it's covered with so much coating and there's very little beef. I can't believe I spent money in this place. It certainly will never happen again. They did used to be good many years ago."}
{"text":"This chain of Chinese restaurant has been in Calgary for decades now. 

Overall pricing is expensive and portions are okay. 

Open for dinner take out only. 

Menu is vast but no substitutions allowed period which is a bummer. 

Not first choice for Chinese take out for SE but flavours are good. 

Overall try else where if you can."}
{"text":"I love there ginger Beef it awesome and you get your food fast fan of the crispy noodles and the service there it great"}
{"text":"Yes, don't laugh, I actually liked their lemon chicken!  It was a craving since I've been eating non-chinese food for my entire work trip so it was a nice change.

Good portion, fast service as it's just primarily a takeout place.  Looks like it's been there for awhile, so hey, i figure it's gotta reputation to uphold.

It ain't no sun sui wah or even Hon's back home in Vancouver, just reliable and good value!

Parking's a bit tough here, located on the busy side of the trendy 17th Ave. area., all on the side streets."}
{"text":"It's funny how many different ways there are to make ginger beef. Being that it was invented in Calgary, you'd think we would have a pretty standardized recipe. But some places make it full of sauce, others not so much. Ginger Beef Express on 14th St falls into the not so much category.

There are plenty of places for takeout in this area, and Ginger Beef Express is one of them. If you can, order ahead for takeout or have it delivered. I walked in off the street and had a rather boring wait on their old office chairs.

If you're dining for one, they have a chef's combo for $9.45. It includes ginger beef, stir fry vegetables, a spring roll and enough fried rice to feed me for at least another meal. It's good value for the price, the service was alright, but the food is standard Western Chinese takeout that you'd find in any food court."}
{"text":"Generic and bland. Lemon chicken dry and beef dishes were interchangeable. Disappointing since one was supposed to be hot and spicy. This is NOT the restaurant I remember from just  couple of years ago. Food was served up fast and 10 percent discount for cash is nice but still not even close to your money's worth. Will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Best food!  Great website. You can order online, then pick up on the way home. Wonderful place we stumbled upon!"}
{"text":"I felt like garbage each time after eating their food. I think they load up on MSG or something. I've eaten Chinese food pretty much everywhere and not felt like that after. It's pricey for what it is and is about average taste wise. I wouldn't order from them again. Super pleasant and professional staff though from the guy answering the phone to the delivery guy. My cousin quite likes them but I couldn't recommend them. I love Chinese food but not from this place."}
{"text":"I've lived nearby for three years and finally ordered from here this weekend.  My family and I split a dinner for four and we've continued to feed off of the leftovers for two days.  The delivery service was fast.

Janna mentioned the heavy Chicken Balls and that much is true, but somehow they are still very good and I'd order them again.  I actually enjoyed the Ginger Beef because it wasn't chewy (which I've often experienced at other establishments), the Cantonese Chow Mein is excellent as are the Spring Rolls.

I'm happy to have found what I'll assume to be a reliable place to order decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese good here. The service isn't bad. If you pick up and pay cash you will get a better deal. You get allot of food for the price as well. 

Not anything amazing but not terrible either"}
{"text":"My best friend encouraged me to try Ginger Beef Express. He even recommended what dishes to order. So I waited until 4:05 to place my order as this shop opens at 4pm. I was info that my order would arrive in 40 minutes as I had one of the first orders of the day. My order did not arrive until 5:39pm. Don't know why it took an hour and a half but what can you do? The 2 dishes and steamed rice were so cool that I had to reheat them in the oven. Will I try this restaurant again? I honestly don't know. Maybe after I've forgotten about how this mediocre experience fades."}
{"text":"I have to say I was super disappointed.  The ginger beef came in all kinds of sizes, from bite size to almost chicken wing size. Some of the breading had no meat inside.  The chicken balls were ok but just way too much breading.  The service was good and the food hot when arrived but those were the only 2 good points. I will not be ordering again"}
{"text":"Great takeout. Happy to have them in Cranston for my monthly Chinese craving. Ginger beef is very crispy and delicious. Check menu online for coupons!"}
{"text":"Given the limited choices in the area we usually tolerated the restaurant. However, today we found a piece of metal shaving in our chicken dish...called to warn them so it won't happen to others (could be dangerous for kids!). The lady on the phone did not care about safety at all, just a quick \"so sorry\" and hung up."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had a hard time finding really good Chinese food in Calgary.  We normally go to Bamboo Gardens off of 16th avenue NE.  It's way to far from us to go often.  We thought we'd give ginger beef express a try and loved it.  We have ordered multiple times since the first try and haven't had an order that hasn't been good."}
