{"text":"This is my second review of this establishment and I have to say they've earned my respect and my repeat business. The calzones are fresh hot and very tasty and the service is quite good as well. They must have fired the old bartenders because the new staff is pretty much on their game!"}
{"text":"Food is simple, but 10/10 if you get what you order. Pizza, salads, sandwiches, and wings. 

I feel like my order is wrong 30% of the time but they always fix it. Kinda sad because the food is sooo delicious. 

I typical get the goat cheese salad or pizza. The old lady smoky voice who answers the phone has an attitude."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars for service and food we have gotten takeout from here twice and it was great! We got pizza, sandwiches , and meatballs.  The lady who answers the phone and does the register is amazing!  She is so sweets. A great family owned business"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the area and their portabella salad is terrific with really nice thick strips of mushrooms. Surprisingly nice restaurant atmosphere for a pizza place in a small strip mall!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in the North hills of Pittburgh.  We've some of their specialty pizzas, but our favorite is the traditional hand tossed xlarge pepperoni."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here several times before. Food is decent when it is made correctly, which is not very often. Recently I have given up ordering here, as my food has always been prepared incorrectly. I gave it another chance, ordering a calzone, pizza and wings. Wings were decent. The calzone was alright but obviously hastily prepared. The pizza was terrible, there was barely any sauce on the pie at all. It's almost like they forgot to even put any sauce on at all. Some of the employees are rude as well, and do not care if they screwed up your order or not. I will be sticking to other pizza places in Wexford for now on."}
{"text":"Great BBQ chicken pizza!!  The pasta is very good as well. The new sports bar is my favorite side.  It has plenty of TV's and a great beer selection. The garlic knots that come with an entre are awesome."}
{"text":"My family frequently gets dinner here & it's definitely one of our favorites. Their pizza, wings, hoagies, & breadsticks are all equally delicious & are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We are out their delivery area - which we learned as their driver delivered our pizzas.   i thought that was pretty cool.  but no worries - as I can easily stop in and pick up a pie on my way home  : )"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The service was alright. We had to ask for everything and she was slow at getting plates out of the way. We had a very busy toddler with us who likes to grab everything in reach and all the empty plates were prime targets. Will be back without the baby."}
{"text":"If you're in for a good dose of pasta fixin', come here. I always really enjoy the food here. I like ordering the pasta, you can pick and choose what to put in it.
Great carbo load after a long run!"}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled Pittsburgh style chicken salad entree and they served the dressing in a small plastic cup.  It was not enough for the size of the salad so I requested another cup.  When I got the check I noticed that they charged 50 cents for the extra dressing!   Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! I am not from the area and my girlfriend and I were famished so we decided to give it a try...so glad we did! Their pizza was excellent I probably couldve gotten a pizza with just sauce on it because their sauce was that good! Tons of menu options all of which are reasonably priced. We got an appetizer of loaded potato skins and a medium pizza with sausage, bacon, and peppers on it mmm.  They had excellent sounding stromboli and calzones, which if I ever return I will invest in because a girl at the table next to us got one and they were HUGE! The place had a very nice atmosphere in the restaurant portion as well ( the other half is a bar, so if you're coming for the food go to the right area haha). Anywho excellent food and id love to return sometime!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem!  I have found this to be a regular lunch stop of mine.  Great salads, great hoagies, great pasta and the Bruschetta is to die for!!!  The staff is amazing, remembers you and your \"regular\" item orders.  You can be in and out in less than 40 minutes!  Amazing!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Pomodoro's at least once a week for a few months now.  Amanda, our waitress (on the bar side), now brings our drink order without us having to order.  She is fantastic!  Still loving it.  They also have the best beer specials during happy hour."}
{"text":"Not big on ambience , but Gigantic on flavors. 
Our server was outstanding and extremely pleasant. We could not have had a more welcoming server. 
The server let us know that everything is made from scratch. 
Ordered the Italian Wedding soup. 
It delivered in a big way. 
It was the best  IWS I have ever had. Tons of flavor. 
We shared the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. 
Homemade dough and you could tell. 
Great chef and you can tell they take pride in what they do. 
$25.00 for lunch for 2 people was a hell of a deal. 
Definetly will be back when in the area. 
Stop in and you're taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered pizza here after leaving church. They said it would be a 30 minute wait however I don't think we even waited 20. We got a large with pepperoni and hot peppers. We were too hungry to wait for a picture but I'm not sure it would have done it justice. It was a thin style with light sauce and was very cheesy. We prefer it this way so we were very happy. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Impressive pizza, yummy pepperoni and cooked well.  Would have liked a little more cheese on the X-large pizzas we ordered for delivery."}
{"text":"If you've been here, check your credit cards! My card was charged $25 for a $10 salad and it took nearly a week for them to give me a refund ( refund on the salad only, they didn't comp the salad, that bothers me ). On the first day we called, we were told we'd get a call back after they looked into it.  Still heard nothing all throughout the entire next day. (Keep in mind, our account has been comprimised, a little more immediate attention was in order in my opinion). The next evening after WE initiated another call to THEM, we eventually got a call back where we were told that their \"drawer was balanced\"at the end of the night.  In other words, \"we don't believe you\".  When we insisted they check again, it became clear to them that they have a bad employee on their hands who doubled our order total AND kept the $1 tip my husband left when we picked up our TO GO order.

This on top of calling ahead the previous week, being told there wasn't a wait, and being made to sit for 45 minutes with my 4-year-old as I stared at an empty table (son's b-day dinner, he wanted to stay). Not to mention the food is sub-par at best. NEVER, EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Very good! I've been here 4 times and am very happy. Nice casual place to have some delicious pizza or salad. I mention the salad since I am really impressed with their homemade Italian dressing (they will sell it to go even though it's not on the menu). The pizza and pasta are very good and the atmosphere is nice. The \"bar side\" is really refreshing and a nice place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly Stumbled upon this local italian restaurant in Wexford. Atmosphere is great and the bathrooms are pristine! Server was outstanding from start to finish. Now let's get to the food: we ordered the bruschetta, 2 side meatballs. Their menu states they used fresh ingredients and let me tell you, they do. Very High quality balsamic vinegar, perfectly seasoned bread toasted to perfection. Outstanding. It's the best ice ever had. The meatballs were definitely homemade and he marinara was delicious. Definitely fresh. 
For entrees, we got a sausage and pepper calzone and the Greek flatbread. The abundance of ingredients inside the calzone and on top of the flatbread were again, fresh, high quality and delicious. Both were baked to perfection, not too dry or wet and the integrity was held. Half of each ended up coming home with us to enjoy again! Too bad we didn't have room for dessert! We look forward to returning with other foodies in the VERY near future. Excellent experience all around."}
{"text":"So far we have eaten from Pomodoro's 3 times. Trip one was to feed our moving helpers. Food was delivered and we were very impressed that the driver found our hidden in the woods house. We had the sicilian pizza which was absolutely delicious and enjoyed by everyone. Trip two was takeout thin crust pizza. It was good, but nothing spectacular.  Now on to trip three-pretty sure that I can not even find the words to explain how awesome our meals were. We went in to the bar and ordered our dinners as takeout. I ordered the Pollo Napoli which is chicken topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, spinach and artichokes. It was served with a fantastic risotto and green beans. It was actually so much food, that I got three meals out of it. My boyfriend ordered the Frutti de Mare in white sauce. All of the seafood was cooked perfectly and he even had leftovers. This morning he even commented that this had to be the best meal that we've had in a long time and asked when we can go back to try something else. The bar area is very clean and bright and is non smoking. Our bartender Lauren was pleasant and very helpful."}
{"text":"The fries are amazing!  Loved the wings.  Pizza very good.  And the bathrooms were clean too!"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered take out.  It's slight pricey for pasta but it was quickly made and ready to go when I got there to pick it up!  The fettuccini Alfredo is very buttery and really wasn't very good.  It's located right off the highway.  They do have a bar and sit down restaurant that I have been to a couple times.  The food is just average."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is casual but not too much ... So I'm happy bringing my family there.  Large TV's but not loud. 

Bar tender / waitress is friendly and is attentive enough.  

Pizza is amongst best around - particularly if you're a New Yorker (Long Island) - crust just right, not too thin, not too chewy. 

Wings also amongst best in area.... Crispy not soft."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian pizza was amazing. I was impressed with the craft beer selection and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Good service! Came in from out of town for business and sat myself at the bar. Was promptly greeted and ordered a beer. Beer selection surprised me- lots to choose from! Plus it was cold! Ordered a small cesar salad and a small pizza. Bartender was attentive and conversational. Never had an empty glass in front of me. I came on a Monday, but I noticed they had different happy hour specials all throughout the week."}
{"text":"The black and blue mussels are simply the best!!! Other favorites are the garlic knots, sicilian pizza, linguine with clams in white sauce, Jimi's special tricolor tortellini with sausage and spicy vodka sauce (it has a nice kick), and Pollo Napoli (which I like a tiny bit better than the saltimbocca). We found that you do have to often ask for the free garlic knots, but once they come, the waitresses are quite generous with refilling."}
{"text":"I hear so many good things about Pomodoro's, but yet every time I go I leave disappointed.  I usually go with larger groups (~9 people) so I expect some delay in service.  This most recent time it took our waitress almost 30 minutes to get our orders after delivering our drinks.  When we asked for bread, we got cool garlic knots dripping with butter in a not so appetizing way.  The salads were good, fresh and crisp.  All of the dressing is served on the side, so if you're dieting, it's great, but if you like nicely disbursed dressing not so ideal.  The entrees are generous in portions but inconsistent.  It's your generic Italian items like chicken parm, pizza, gnocchi.  None of it is all that memorable, but it's not really bad either.  It's just okay.  Again, took a very long time to get our checks and pay.  Let's just say, I wouldn't downright refuse to go here, but it's not on my list of favorite Italian places in Pittsburgh, or really even in the North Hills."}
{"text":"This place has good food and reasonable beer prices. The pizza is good and the atmosphere is really great. Try this place but as much as I like it stay away from the wings. I'm a wing snob and the buffalo wings are covered with grease. The little hot sauce doesn't cling to the wing at all. Don't fall for the picture in the menu. They don't look like that at all."}
{"text":"Food is good. Terrible service. I always had food delivered from Pomodoro's. They told me it will take 40-45min. I didn't get my pizza for 1hour 30min. I called them around after an hour and told me they were really busy.. I wish they could've told me that before and pizza wasn't very warm when I got it. No sincere apologies, pizza was still full priced. I'm not ordering from here anymore. It sucks because I really liked their pizza."}
{"text":"The food here is really uneven. The pizza can sometimes be really good and sometimes really average. I've had good pasta (can't recall the dish), an awful burger and fries (all frozen foods), great pizza, blah pizza and really good appetizers. 

Tonight is a prime example. I ordered the Chicago Style, which was really good the last time I had it. This time, it was merely okay and contained random onions that weren't there before. Unfortunately, they were too strong and overpowered the rest of the slice. $18 down the tube. 

The delivery guys are always friendly, though they've messed up multiple times. The older lady at the counter can be a challenge as she seems to work a little slow. Everyone is very friendly though. I've only dined in once and it was okay service. 

My recommendation would be to go to Pizza Labella, which is 15 minutes farther away, but is ALWAYS excellent. I think I'm done with this place since I never know what I'm going to end up with, good food or average food (or the wrong food)."}
{"text":"Got the buffalo chicken pizza and bacon cheese fries taste good. Doesn't make me want to run back for more but a decent place to try."}
{"text":"A really nice little eatery that we stumbled upon on our journey home to Chicago!  Good pasta and pizza! Loved the meatballs! And great with the kids!"}
{"text":"We live close by , and frequent this lovely neighborhood restaurant . What is so nice is one side has a hopping bar with Pirates , Steelers & Pens games always streaming on the many TVS .
There is also a quieter more relaxing dining room. Best of all the chef is amazing ! Authentic Italian dishes. ! My all time FAVORITE is Lemon Pollo.. A yummy chicken dish with flavor that will melt in your mouth ! Every night they offer a risotto .. Always terrific ! 
The sandwich , pizza and appetizer menu offers so many choices . We have been there so many times .. I NEVR get the same thing ., always terrific . Fried zucchini another fav ! Check it out ..  You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Updated review:  This is a full restrauant, pizza takeout, and bar with tv's.  Casual throughout.  Been there 2 times on a Saturday evening.  Bar side was packed for 44 or so people at my count.  But what makes it excellent was it was properly staffed -- 8-9 people working just the bar side alone.  I am sure they sell enough to support having real staffing.   Pizza was good, but not remarkable as pizza goes.  Many designer beers on tap and in the refrigerator.  Looks like this has emerged as a go to place and a locals place.  Easy access from Brandt School Road --- DO NOT park in the back as that is a closed area -- use the bank in the evening.  

Simply excellent service.

f8 and be there."}
{"text":"The girl with the lisp, the \"manager\", is very unprofessional. She was rude and refused to split a check between a coworker and I. Apparently the \"wall\" is not served seating fyi. We were approached by a waitress upon entering this establishment, we ordered drinks and food. Once our drinks were gone and we requested more the serves refused to get is refills and kept telling us they would be back and never returned."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the North Hills, hands down. We usually carry out since it is close but they also deliver. For a sit down meal, the dinners are fantastic and they are pretty good at rotating in new specials. Classic Italian American cuisine, come hungry. Good bar/tap selection too if you are waiting for pizza or stopping by for a drink."}
{"text":"Just stopped there on business from Cleveland and the pizza was excellent. Had a pepperoni and sausage. The dough was on the thinner side with a nice balance of cheese and sauce and the sausage had a nice little bite to it. Great work guys."}
{"text":"Yummy! We come here every so often and have never been disappointed. We always get fantastic service and the food is delightful. Stopped today as the hubby was in the mood for pasta. We started with the pepperoni rolls which we had never tried before, wow! You get two huge rolls which me and the hubby split. They are chalked full of melted, cheesy goodness and pepperoni. The dough is salty, coupled with the terrific marinara sauce they give you to dip your roll in, delicious as the marinara is on the sweeter side. A good mix of salty and sweet. I chose pizza, a gourmet which was the spinach and feta pizza. As usual, tasty! The hubby got the penne pasta in the pesto cream sauce which was on the menu as Alfredo based. The waitress noted there was a parmesan cheese added to the sauce however they could nix it if the hubby did not want it in his sauce as the sauces are made to order and sure enough his sauce did not include an ounce of cheese. He was a happy camper as he is not a fan of cheese. We got yummy bread to start as well. What a delightful, local place! If you are in the area and looking for pasta and/or pizza stop here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One of the best italian places around here. Great food and reasonable prices. If you're a man try the pepperoni and sausage calzone and let me know if I misled you! Some of these reviewers are just whiny babies ..."}
{"text":"We have started coming back about once or twice a month. 
I love the house salad and the quality and quantity of ingredients.
Service is pretty good for the most part. Had to wait some times for service but nothing that made us want to leave. One of the best pizza joints around IMO !
Right up there if not better than - Large Plain on Babcock Blvd. in Ross. or Center Avenue slice in West View. 
Wonderful place and we will be back and bring friends !"}
