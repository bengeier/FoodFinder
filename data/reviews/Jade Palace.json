{"text":"The food was good even for takeout.  it was ready a little earlier than stated so when picking up it was already sitting on the counter which was disappointing.  Jade Palace dining-in is fantastic and earns 5 stars each time we visit there."}
{"text":"This restaurant has no concept of good customer service!!!  We are regular customers of this restaurant.  We went there on Sunday with a coupon ($10 off $45 bill) and ordered four dishes which easily totaled $45.  After we had finished the second course, we were told that they had run out of bok choy.  Consequently we were forced to cancel the fourth dish as we did not like the alternative of green beans.  When the bill came of $38 came we asked if they would honor the coupon because it was their fault we that we did not exceed the amount.  We were told no by the management.  Needless to say, we did not pay a tip.  Does this restaurant not understand the meaning of good customer service?  And how can a Chinese restaurant run out of bok choy!   As a result, they have lost a regular customer and I will let our friends know that Jade Palace don't care for their customers."}
{"text":"The food isn't all that great, extremely greasy and over sauced, though I will say the hot and sour soup is delicious. I always order it when I go. My boyfriend hates it everytime we get food from there and the last time I ordered shrimp from there it was not cooked correctly or even cleaned properly. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and reasonably priced. Atmosphere can be a tad lacking depending upon where you sit in the place.   Ask for the east side near the Gu Zheng (Chinese Harp) player. You'll feel as if you're in Beijing"}
{"text":"A fine quality Chinese food in Scottsdale. My workplace caters from Jade Palace every month, so I had a chance to sample a wide variety from the menu. Their glazed salmon is great, perfectly cooked. Also try Shrimp Marnier (only if you like a little sweet taste in your entrees), it comes with candied walnuts which are a nice throw-off palate pleasers. Other fare such as dumplings, low mein, General Tso's Chicken etc. is good too. My Chinese colleagues tell me that, while their food may not be 100% authentic, they are happy to tweak it to make it more 'Chinese' if requested.   When me and my wife opt for a take-out from here, our \"The Usual\" includes chicken fried rice (done spicy) and spring rolls, all of which taste great. The level of spiciness is always spot on as per the request.   I am taking one star off because: (1) Their fried rice is usually verrry oily. The oil literally drips from the container, and we usually toss last few morsels from the bottom of the container due to excessive oil. (2) Their orange chicken is a little 'weird'. Chicken nuggets usually come out dry (too much time in frying pan??) , and the sauce recipe is probably different than usual. It doesn't taste like typical Orange Chicken you get from other places.   Overall: A good Chinese restaurant with great food and great ambience. Try their Lunch specials.   Cherry on top: Zero food safety violations, and hence an 'A' grade by health department. Try this one if you want to stay away from cheap take out places with questionable hygiene.  P.S. : Right next door to Jade Palace is \"Sweet Republic\" ice cream parlor, which was rated to be one of the Top 10 ice cream parlors in U.S. Some of their flavors are phenomenal.. but more on that in a different review."}
{"text":"not an authentic chinese cuisine but still good. the fried rice wasnt the best. overall experience was good. hot and sour soup was yummy, and the crab puffs too."}
{"text":"Despite specifying what i wanted and confirming they could make it i ended up with \"chicken chow mein\" american style made with spaghetti noodles swimming in soy sauce with no vegetables even though i asked twice.  A step up from panda express. Save your $$$."}
{"text":"Though I've enjoyed lunch at this restaurant many times, dinner is a different story.  I ordered the Grand Marnier Shrimp and requested a minor substitute of rice...the waiter refused, saying \"That's only available on the lunch menu\".  I asked to speak to the Maitre D' and he refused to accommodate me.  My wife ordered the Filet Mignon & Shrimp in a Brown sauce...the steak was ordered rare.  All you can say is that the sauce was indeed brown but not with any noticeable flavor.  When we mentioned to the Maitre D' its blandness, he suggested my wife put soy sauce on her steak...on a filet! (The only reason I had soy at the table is because after trying to get the attention of the waiter, I could not and I had to get up, got to the wait station and help myself.    A few moments later my wife noted that the steak which apparently had had no seasoning applied and whose sauce was flavorless was not rare either...it was actually way past well-done and tough as nails.  Service was inept...waiter did not visit the table - there was no refill of water.  My Grand Marnier Shrimp was dry, not enough sauce and the broccoli on both dishes was cold.  This was a Birthday celebration for my wife.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Total rip off! Ordered take out. Took forever. Food was cold and the cartons not even filled to the top. Rude customer service and WAY OVER PRICED!!!!!! Stick chop Sticks in my eyes if I ever come back here."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in the Phoenix area and I always laugh when people make comments about the \"quality of Chinese food\" here. Are you kidding? At this moment there are more people of Chinese descent in the San Francisco airport than in the entire State of Arizona. You aren't going to find the same food here as you will find in places like San Francisco and Vancouver. It's simply not going to happen.   But, if you've got a taste for Americanized Chinese food, this is a good choice.  I'm confused by the ageism demonstrated in some of these reviews.  I haven't noticed that a lot of old people eat here, probably because I don't care.  Heck, I'd rather be surrounded by people my parent's age than a restaurant full of young children with noodles hanging out of their mouth.  I've always had consistently good service and good food at this restaurant.  I'm certain you can find better Chinese food in San Francisco, but Jade Palace is much closer."}
{"text":"Grand Marinier shrimp and sweet and pungent shrimp are dynamite!  Egg drop soup is the best I have had.  One of the Best Chinese food places I have ever had!"}
{"text":"They need to pay more attention to food quality. Flavor is lacking. I have been eating there for 10 years and it's always so-so.  My parents come in once year for vacation and like to get takeout....I'm going to Flos next time"}
{"text":"A good go to spot for neighborhood Chinese. The atmosphere is a little more upscale than the traditional Chinese joint which is nice. This is our go to spot for Chinese locally."}
{"text":"Great food but a bit overpriced. $60 for 3 entries and some fried rice seems a bit overpriced. It was good though."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us for lunch.  Our table was ready with our reservation and we were promptly seated.  The first course was fried won tons which were delicious.  They brought 2 plates out, with hot mustand and sweet sauce.  We all got the combination plate and mine was hot and sour soup, crab rangoon, spring roll, fried rice and beef, shrimp and scallops in a brown sauce.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  We stayed for a long time at the table talking and were not rushed out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"A co-worker I was with summed up our lunch crowd succinctly with, \"This feels like the Chinese equivalent of Waffle House.\"  The food is bland, the d√©cor is generic with smooth jazz playing over the speakers, and the food is served with a knife and fork - you have to ask for chopsticks.  There are much better Chinese food places within walking distance of this place.  I only recommend Jade Palace if you like your Chinese experience without any hint of ethnicity."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic even on a Saturday night; however, the food was subpar.  We had the house fried rice and General Tso's Chicken.  The fried rice wasn't great but the GT Chicken was very good."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Scottsdale Chinese food. Got delivery as well and they were quite quick, delivering 15 minutes earlier than expected!   Got the house lo mien, pepper steak and home style bean curd. Pretty good compared to the other places around here and we had plenty of food for leftovers."}
{"text":"Time for an update. On a seemingly quiet Monday evening, we were in the mood for good chinese food. On the way to Jade Palace last evening, I said to my hubby and son,\" I am SO in the mood for shellfish. I hope they have it on the menu tonight.\" To our delight and surprise, there was a softshell crab appetizer (delicious cooked with jalapenos) and a full lobster prepared in ginger and scallion sauce. Hubby and I split the divine lobster and it was reasonably priced- $36 for 1 3/4 pounds. Our son ordered the Yang Chow Fried rice (a family favorite) and everyone was happy. Manager Hugh (cousin of the owner) always makes everyone welcome and happy."}
{"text":"Okay there is no large Chinese population in the Greater Phoenix area so authentic Chinese food is going to be impossible to find. But this place had the greatest variety of spicy dishes so I thought we would give it a try, even though reviews were mixed.   They have two locations, we went to the one on Shea in Scottsdale. We arrived at 8:00 on a Saturday evening and it was very busy.  The tables were packed tightly together.  The waiter was Asian and seemed to have a limited command of English. He managed to spill a glass of water on my wife, and had to come back 4 times to find a bottle of wine that they were not out of.    However the food was better than expected and arrived quickly.  We ordered 2 Sichuan dishes, Hunan beef, and Peking duck. I asked for chili oil on the side and it didn't arrive until most of the spicy dishes were gone; the spice level without it was a bit bland. Plenty of garlic in them, and the Hunan beef had plenty of the black fermented beans.  The duck was quite tasty, the server rolled up the pancakes for us and brought extra plum sauce.   Would have given another star except for the service.  The manager did come over and apologized, then comped us the $60 bottle of wine.     Will I return?  Maybe. I will know better what to order and will plan to arrive well after the peak dinner hours if I do."}
{"text":"\"Upscale Chinese restaurant, excellent food, not-Chinese-food-cheap, but worth your money 4/5  We were glad when we found out and tried out this restaurant in our neighborhood. Jade Palace is not your regular eat-and-out Chinese restaurant. It has more upscale ambiance, less Chinese/Asian eaters, more pricey than average BUT the food was fabulous. As a Chinese myself, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any Chinese food lover. If you want dimsum, you need to go on Sunday (I believe around brunch time). The dimsum was good too, but I am more fond of its dishes with steam rice. YUM!"}
{"text":"Off to a good start with crispy noodles (upon request) at this Scottsdale 'upscale' Chinese restaurant served with hot mustard and sweet and sour dips... wait staff very attentive and friendly. Ordered PORK EGG FOO YOUNG and finally had it served properly with a dark beefy gravy plus duck sauce on the side. For a couple of dollars more than the fast food 'take- out' joints you can have a really nice sit down dinner. Ideal for a date to add some class to your night. Ask for \"sweetie-pie\" for exceptional service... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I got delivery from Jade Palace and the delivery time was reasonable (about 40 minutes at 7:00 on a Friday night), and the food was pretty good. The egg rolls and wonton soup were great. The Singapore noodles were also very good but their \"very spicy\" isn't very spicy.  The only issue that I had was that I asked for the noodles to not have onion, but they did...  All and all it's pretty good Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in Scottsdale hands down.  I'm from Chicago and travel extensively and I've not found a Chinese place that is better!  The owner Devlin is wonderful and I'm sure he'll stop by to say hi!!"}
{"text":"BEST chinese cuisine ever!  Fast delivery, nicest delivery guys, worth every penny!  Great quantity too"}
{"text":"This is not the Jade Palace it used to be.  Noodles were mushy, orange chicken gooey and not much flavor, and the eggrolls were fat and soggy -- all had way too much oil.  I don't expect perfection with take out, but this isn't even close.  This was my favorite place."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Very overpriced for the quality and portions of the dishes. I guess rich Scottsdale folks don't mind paying $17-$20 a dish, for average Chinese food. The portions should have been priced at half the amount. The menu was limited and small. We even preordered the Peking Duck, $40, and they served it with floor tortillas! Really? They were more like chicken burritos. They didn't use rice wraps, and it wasn't even that great. Some of the dishes came to us Luke warm. They were probably holding them to bring out all at once. Overall if you never had really good Chinese food to compare this too and have the means to pay for overpriced dishes. (Our total bill was $260 for 8 people, not including tip.) to be honest the only saving grace was the crab puffs. They were good, but also over priced. The service was also very good. They even did sweet and sour chicken, with sauce on the side for my picky cousin."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service and very dedicated employees.  Big fan, I go there often and if you ask the Mgr. (Hugh) he can prepare things that are not even on the menu.  They are always coming up with new things to eats. The best are: Ribs/all specials/New York egg rolls-with Devlin sauce/noodles, everything is good. Great fun atmosphere  in the bar."}
{"text":"very disappointed. The food was Americanized, bland, and resulted in an upset stomach and headache. As a person of Chinese decent and missing good Chinese food, it was a HUGE disappointment. In addition, the service was horrible. Unfriendly staff and we had to ask for our bill so we could get out of there as fast as we could. The best thing we ate was the after dinner mint. The ambiance was nice but we were so close to the next table we could hear EVERYTHING! And we were bumping into them."}
{"text":"Their food is great for Arizona Chinese... having grown up in NY with traditional Cantonese everywhere, I've been looking for it since the day I arrived here, decades ago.  Jade Palace comes the closest.  They'd get 5 stars except their service isn't always on point."}
{"text":"My family and I love to eat here. The service is always great, and the food is always out quickly. If you don't like to wait long at restaurants, then this is the place to be. They are much better than Panda Express, and their fried rice and lo Mein is incomparable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our favorite chinese food restaurant.  Leon is a hoot too!   Our favorites, include hot spicy eggplant, four seasons, royal nest and of course, the grand mariner shrimp.  Yummmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"In short way of telling how's my experience it was less than par. I ordered yang chow fried rice and I think panda express is better than this joint. It was a take out and when I get to open it I don't have anything to use to eat my order. I called back and she told me I did not ask wow. The shrimp was not fresh it smells."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.  I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.  It's modern and Asian.    Went there with 2 friends and the food was great and the service was superb.  My friend loved it so much that she is going to bring her Mom on her next visit.  The stir fry shrimp dish was wonderful with large shrimps.  The green bean was so delicious that I want to add it to my next Thanksgiving dinner.  I had a bit of trouble with the bones on the roast duck, but it was finger licking good.  The only miss for us that night was the pot sticker because we didn't like the thick wrapping though the fillings were quite tasty.  I agreed with Nicole that most of the clientele are on the older side, but with the great food, service and reasonable pricing, I could care less how old the people at next table are."}
{"text":"General Tso's chicken was soggy. Fried rice was oily and bland. Service was good, but overall the food is overpriced and mediocre."}
{"text":"I come here way too much! This place is the best Chinese I've had in the Phoenix area. The restaurant is large and well decorated, and the service is always great. We've had the sizzling seabass, orange chicken, lettuce wraps, dumplings, shrimp with pretty much every vegetable they have, and more! Everything is delicious. Definitely give it a try, I think you'll be back! Also, it's always packed....on every weeknight or weekend that I've gone there. That says something!   P.S. the only reason it's 4 star and not 5, is I still compare to my favorite Chinese place ever, in Minnesota (Great Wall if you ever visit)!"}
{"text":"This was just OK. The service was decent, but my hot and sour soup was cold. Our Moo Shu Chicken was not that flavorful and just OK. I've had better steamed dumplings from Trader Joe's. Desert Jade in Central Phoenix is much better and less expensive. I felt this was very expensive for what you got. The inside was pretty and the service was nice, but I've had better food elsewhere. Just bleh, IMHO."}
{"text":"Their weekend Dim Sum is pretty good but I'd pass on the rest of their food.  Their General Tso's chicken had the consistency of chewing gum."}
{"text":"OMG! The best Chinese I ever had! Great General Tso's chicken!!! My sons loved your hot and sour soup! Yumo!!!!"}
{"text":"Chinese food is not dead, thanks to Jade Palace. Located on Hayden and the corner of Via de Ventura, it is a local hidden treasure with a great ambiance at a reasonable price. Although the dining is set up for intimate parties of 2 or 4, they accommodated my birthday party of 20 with ease. (Definitely call ahead!) White table cloths, dim lighting, and a impressive wine list (try the plum wine) gives a sense of class but food is good and price is reasonable. Must try food include: won ton soup (best I have ever had, tons of fresh snow peas, carrots, shrimp, and won tons), steamed sea bass and ginger, BBQ pork ribs and the yang chow fried rice. Service is quick and super-friendly (Henry is an awesome!)."}
{"text":"Make sure you don't order the americanized Chines food there since it only tastes soso. The authetic Chinese food is great.  Don't order its lunch special. If you can read its Chinese menu (the one without English), you get some wonderful food there."}
{"text":"I lived in Los Angeles for over 10 years. This restaurant is one of the few in Phoenix that can meet my expectation. Another one is Great Wall Cuisine.  Their Chinese menu are great. Try their crabs, lobsters or geoducks.  Those 3 are the best seafood if you like Cantonese Cuisine."}
{"text":"Great American style Chinese, comparable to NYC and LA. Specials are interesting and the staples, I.e. Gen Tsos, chix w/ broccoli, shrimp w/ lobster sauce, etc... Are great and I wouldn't change a thing.   Manager makes an effort but has a slightly pretentious attitude as they consider their build out and location to be \"high end\"  Meal cost approx $20/pp so be prepared to pay more than Flos or others."}
{"text":"Made reservations and were seated very quickly, The food is very good. However, we had an unexpected visitor. After finishing dinner we watched a cockroach crawl out from under a table and proceeded across the floor of the dining room. We pointed this out to a staff member who \"stepped on\" the roach and went to retrieve a napkin and plastic glove. Upon returning he picked up the deceased and disposed of it. We were shocked. The manager apologized and stated that although he has seen crickets, Never a cockroach? So, Meh. Think will skip this Palace of roaches."}
{"text":"Didn't have a reservation (our fault) so had to wait for a table . People with no reservations but who knew the staff were seated first. Ended up sitting at the bar. The bartender ignored us for a long time, then finally took our order. Got it wrong. When we got home everything was not good at all. Barely eatable. We will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Fried dumplings were good, with excellent sauce. Lo mien and moo shoo were also very good, but sauces were a little on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Running 45 minutes behind for carryout, apparently the health inspector is on property and I am only left to assume that the surprise visit is causing chaos in the kitchen. The lobby is full of other customers experiencing the same problems. They of course didn't mention this before the meal was already paid for which means they don't care or it's incompetence."}
{"text":"this may be the best chinese food in the valley like ny. great ribs,wonton, mongolian beef anshrimps/lobster sauce with fried rice/my favorite and house  chow fun"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this zero.  Ordered two very simple take out dishes tonight.  Chicken chow mein and chicken with vegetables. Ordered brown rice too.   Chow mein was truly disgusting.  Not one noodle in the chow mein.  All bean sprouts, chicken and celery with a soup like sauce.  Ugh... horrible.   Chicken with vegetables had at least two cups of water chestnuts and about 1/3 of a green pepper with a little bit of chicken That's it, no other vegetables.  Brown rice was like the consistency of oatmeal.  Another ugh!  Down the garbage disposal it all went.  What a rip off of $35.00 for two dishes and rice."}
{"text":"Went to Jade Palace last night for dinner. Thinking it was a Monday night, a typically slow day for restaurants, we just drove over and figured we'd quickly be seated. Walked in, and this place was crazy busy. Ended up waiting a half hour to be seated. Always call ahead with this place, as it is VERY popular. Food was fantastic, and they were willing to add tofu to a dish not on the menu. If it is normally as busy as it was last night, additional kitchen staff would help speed up dining. Our server was very apologetic, and he kept checking on us and filling drinks, but it was a long wait.   Only complaint is the dining room is cramped. Could have one less table, thus easing mobility when being seated, going to bathrooms, and leaving. BUT, it's obvious the crowds that flock here will fill every table and be prepared to wait for their favourite food, so a maximum number of seats might be a good thing. Overall wonderful place."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food in Arizona is very hard to find.  Being from NYC, I've heard native Arizonans and mid-westerners say how good certain Chinese food restaurants are and go to it only to find that it's mediocre at best, with food being absolutely tasteless.  Not so for Jade Palace.  The food is absolutely wonderful!  I've tried many dishes and have not been disappointed once.  The house egg foo young is second to none and it's always difficult to not order it and try something else.  My wife is a vegetarian and loves anything with tofu here.  I have a niece from the east coast who insists that the chicken and broccoli is first rate.  Nothing is oily or tasteless, as has been the case with other Chinese restaurants that I've tried in the Phoenix metropolitan valley, nor is anything overly salty or over-cooked.  The wait staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly, and the maitre d (or owner, not sure which) comes around to make sure everything is exactly as you'd like it to be, making you feel like a regular.  Very nice touch.  Prices vary from moderate to slightly expensive, but it's all worth it.  We love the outdoor patio year round (heat lamps in the winter, misters in the summer) and very much enjoy the landscaped pond as well as the colorful, festive view of the outdoor patio of Jalapeno Inferno across the way."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the Jade Palace several times this past winter. Always excellent service and food. It gets busy on the weekends so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Jade Palace is a great little gem tucked away in a strip mall near Pinnacle Peak Rd. and Scottsdale Rd.  I recently binged on a bunch of delicious dishes here as a pre-diet feast.  The place was packed with sliver-haired snow birds.  There was some cougar action at the bar which I always love to watch, but now that i think of it, it was more of a Hugh Hefner and his 24 year old bride-to-be action.  I was actually the only cougar there. :)  I digress.    3 Delicacies is great.  Tender flank steak with tender scallops and tender shrimp.  Crab puffs were awesome and light and flaky but creamy and lovely in the middle.  Fried rice is excellent and they don't skimp on meat if you choose to order it with chicken.  And the chicken was tender.  Generous portions. Again, everything is lovely, yummy, fresh, tender, and most importantly, NOT TOO GREASY, which we all know is the signature of Chinese food. And my Absolut Press was poured in generous manner. :)  If you are looking for crappy food don't go here.  If you are looking to meet men, go here but expect them to all be over 65. If you are looking to meet younger men and have crappy food, go to Sapporo."}
{"text":"I go to this location for lunch with friends and I have been to the north Scottsdale location too. It's newer but both have nice ambiance. Chicken chow fun is a feat dish and big enough to share.  Lunch specials are great portions and proved well."}
{"text":"We just ordered take-out from the Jade Palace last night, so the experience is fresh in my mind. The overall rating from us is 3.5 stars, taking in to account the food and service.   Although we have dined in many times before, we decided to order a standard Chinese meal, sweet and sour chicken, with pork fried rice as a side---that was it. The chicken's breading tasted sort of stale to me although the meat itself was plentiful and tender. I thought the fried rice was so-so too, lacking in some seasoning and the onions were too crunchy for my liking, although it tends to be that way in fried rice. Overall, we give our food 3 stars.  The service, as always, is very good. The \"phone answerer\" when I called was polite and efficient. When I ran in to the pick up the food, the chatty and attentive hostess double-checked the order and price for me without me having to ask. The place was packed, and I am glad that we got take-out this time.  Just to share our experience with the food in recent past:  I thought the food quality was better for lunch rather than dinner. About a month ago, I had my usual lunch, the shrimp with vegetables that comes in a light and tasty garlic sauce with plump crab rangoon and my favorite, their hot and sour soup. I really like that soup; it's full of mushrooms and tofu and hits the spot as far as I am concerned. On this experience, I give their food normally 4 stars at lunch.  Overall, this is a solid spot for food and service, nothing great or particularly poor, thus the 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"We love the food.  Dine in is much better than carry out or delivery.  They tend to skimp on the meat during 80% of the deliveries.  All in all its good food and would recommend it if your eating there vs carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"I give it two stars only because of the fact that was eating dinner with my son and wife. Food was slightly above mediocre. Been to other Chinese restaurants where the quality was Superior and the price even better. Unrealistic to imagine you going to get out of there for less than $50 for a couple. We ordered hot tea which probably costs pennies to make and was charged $3.50 for something that should have been free at any Chinese restaurant. The New York style egg rolls which were no more than four or five inches long for $4.50 each for the 2. The War Wonton was for 3 people and instead of giving us the price for 4 people they charged one and a half times the to sharing price and that came out to $15. The two main dishes which barely fed three adults brought the bill up to $65.. definitely overpriced and I can definitely say that's $65 Plus 20% tip could have been spent and many other better restaurants. We've been going to Jade Palace are there at this location, off of Shea, or the old one off of Pinnacle Peak Road 4 years but without a significant Groupon War coupon from the mail of at least $20 savings it's definitely not worth the money spent"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese places in the city. It is the only place to get ribs made the right way New York style The pork fried rice is also the best I am including the so called authentic places in town I travel to Hong Kong so I know what I am talking about. Ellie our server was wonderful for special service Every dish here is above the mark for excellence Prices higher than most others but food atmosphere and area is worth it. They should not be charging for tea. Their dim sum need work but the sticky rice is on the money!"}
{"text":"You know-I went here with some friends because the friend had won a gift card in an auction.  First of all, we went at 7:30 on a Saturday, it was dead.  Not a good sign.  Ordered spicy calamari for appetizer, it was definetly the highlight of the meal.  Our waitress was nice, but seemed to be in a rush and was very hard to understand.  We ordered cripsy orange beef, steamed halibut and kung pao chicken.  Here is where it got disappointing.  The halibut honestly tasted like dishwater.  No flavor at all, and kind of gummy.  The kung pao was not spicy, and the cripsy orange beef is so much better at PF Changs it is pathetic.  Because it was my friends birthday, they brought us ice cream with balls of kim-chee fruit.  We all tasted it and were laughing about the way it looked (BALLS) of kim-chee.  ( I am sure I am spelling that wrong) But the waitress thought we liked it, so she brought us 2 balls of that gross fruit in a martini glass, on ice.  I do not need to elaborate about the jokes that followed-seriously, one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  Long story-but basically, go to Changs, better, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Started with the hot and sour soup, which was hands down the best I'd ever had. Flavorful and without the sharpness that H&S soup can sometimes have. For the main course, we had the Mongolian beef, which was deeply and richly flavored, and the prawn/scallop/beef kung pao. The scallops especially were like butter.   On top of it all, the service was phenomenal and the restaurant had a lovely ambiance.  Would absolutely recommend for anyone who wants amazing Cantonese cuisine in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today for the first time. Staff and server was excellent. Great menu. outstanding food and presentation. Will be our #1 Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Scottsdale.  Excellent hot n sour soup. Excellent pork fried rice Very good beef and vegetables.  The only improvement would be if they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"FYI..they say they deliver and even step you through delivery process offering menu and step by step process. After finishing order had to call with question and the girl informs me they don't deliver! Ugh...then please don't offer thru yelp. Emily informed me their website is under construction! Still think they should remove offer that they deliver at least on yelp."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had. Great service. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. We had hot and sour soup, chicken fried rice, beef with broccoli, teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken. It was all very delicious."}
{"text":"We frequent this place once a month. It's normally  pretty good. Tonight was as bad as it gets! We waited 45 minutes to be seated and the food was horrible. It took 20 minutes just to order once we were seated. The food came wrong and no one seemed to care.  It will be a long time before we try this place again. Don't order the shrimp egg foo young... There was a mysterious ingredient in there."}
{"text":"Our first time at Jade Palace and it was superb! Excellent food and service. We will definitely return. I had the beef and broccoli-very tender and tasty. My husband rice noodles with BBQ pork, also tender and tasty. Very reasonably priced. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Something for everyone, just find your style. Grand Mariner shrimp with broccoli is delicious & unique!"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese place good for either takeout or nice dine-in experience. The staff were all very nice and they seemed to know and take care of their return customers. The food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced. We had kung pao chicken and hot and sour soup. It's a great neighborhood spot and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We decided to try Jade Palace as we would love to find a good Chinese place in our neighborhood.  JP  has a very nice ambience.  Their staff was friendly but, seemed to disappear on occasion.  Their food is just mediocre at best.  I think it is lacking in flavor as it seems to cater to a lot of old people who want their food unseasoned.  We used a LOT of chili oil to season it up.  We much prefer Desert Jade on Indian School (review coming)  I almost gave JP 2 stars based on the food but, the ambiance and friendly Staff pulled it up to 3."}
{"text":"The best thing about the Kung Pao dishes here are that they don't contain fifty-percent zucchini like at most places I've been to.  The water chestnuts, baby corn, sliced carrots, and the right amount of peanuts are the perfect mixture with the meat that is provided in the dish,  especially the Kung Pao trio.  The won tons have a tiny bit of oiliness that says \"this was made with the mildest and lightest oil possible to accomdate the light and crispy texture.  The servers are kind and quick and the interior has a humble ambiance accompanied by just the right amount of air conditioning to make for a relaxing and comfortable experience."}
{"text":"Lots of corn starch and oil.  Nothing alive, vibrant or original.  Asked about organic tofu (non gmo) and the reply indicated no awareness,  Is this really the best Scottsdale has to offer?  And all for $70 bucks for 3 of us,  Oh credit where it's due.  The wine was good,"}
{"text":"Double dragon shrimp were fantastic. Three treasures Kung Pao sharing, scallop and beef was delicious. Could use some more spice though. Attentive service. Attractive dining room. An excellent dining experience which more than matched the $20/person pricing.  Would highly recommend.  Would give it 4.5 stars to be precise"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food west of Detroit!!! Try the Imperial Duck, House egg foo young, house fried rice, NY style egg rolls and to top that off, get the almond cookies."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese in this area. Not only is sooo good but the food is always consistent.   I always get the Sweet & Sour Chicken. YUM! And the Wonton Soup is good too however I wish they put more wonton noodles in it. The vegetarian spring rolls are the best! The crab puffs are also good.  There food is by far better than Flo's. NO chewy fat on any of the meat at Jade Palace! And I know that every time I either order take out our dine it, its going to be great food!"}
{"text":"The only thing good was the rice. I ordered chow mein noodles... NOODLES! This piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup. Called and the guy was a dick. If you know Chinese food this is not it! Waste of money. I hope they go out of business."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. Mostly because the dishes don't have a can of mixed vegetables dumped on them like the dishes in a few of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in AZ. The sizzling sea bass and Peking duck were standouts for me. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"**************Hai, (Yes, it's true). FIVE STARS****************  This is the place for Traditional Chinese...........you'll love the menu. The dishes  ..........are not lacking in sauce.  Each dishes sauce......is distinct from other entrees sauces. Portion size is very good. Everything tasted FRESH.  The Wait Staff........is top notch.  Unlike George & Sons The Hot Tea is FREE Also, Brown Rice is FREE At George .........You'll pay $2 for each."}
{"text":"Trying to find East coast style Chinese food here in the Phoenix area can be tricky.  The closest I've come is Jade Palace my two favorite locations are Scottsdale road and Pinnacle Peak road and the one on Shea and 92nd street.  Jade has all the traditional Cantonese dishes that I grew up on in NYC, the service is excellent and the food consistent.  So when I'm in the mood for Chinese I head to Jade Palace"}
{"text":"This is one of the most consistent chinese food places in the valley.  It has great (ny style) food and an accommodating staff.  Good for take out and dining in!"}
{"text":"Finally found sound chinese food that's delicious!  Been here 3 times and food was very good, kind of expensive but worth the cost."}
{"text":"We did take out dinner today for the first time from this place.  We had previously been to a couple of other Chinese food places and had been disappointed.  The food was really nice.  The heart and sour soup is the bestwe have ever had.  The rest of the food was above average"}
{"text":"Picked up take our for a dinner with friends;  the egg rolls were great as usual yet the chicken egg Foo Yung lacked taste even with the gravy as well as chicken fried rice. The Rice noodles with  shrimp dish was great as usual. Guess the kitchen was having an off day."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here. I have tried many different items on the menu, and I've always been happy with my order.  They don't use MSG in any of there food which is also nice for a Chinese restaurant. Compared to the other Chinese restaurants in the area, this is definitely the best. No completion. I only wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"We went to lunch here one Sunday, It was a bit pricey for Chinese for lunch but it had an exceptional menu-It was dinner prices because of the weekend which ranged from about $16-30 a plate, they do seem to have lunch specials during the weekdays. On the other hand the food was really delicious, it was a nice, sit down restaurant, with a great selection of food and good customer service. I was happy that they served Brown rice, which many places do not offer. The only thing that could make this place even better then it already is, is if it offered weekend lunch specials. We will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"We went late at night after arriving in Scottsdale after a long flight. The restaurant had a charming atmosphere but we ordered takeout.  The food was fresh and delicious.  We ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan and it had a lovely sauce. Really hit the spot after a long day.  Would like to go back and eat in."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was incredible!  The best crab puffs I've ever had. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent Chinese food, plain and simple.  I found the service to be good despite being packed. Be prepared for a 20 minute wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Crisp Chinese Cuisine   Flavorful, festive, and friendly. Jade Palace is a small restaurant that masters the taste of Chinese cuisine with intense flavors that will leave you wanting more. From the dim lighting to the mini aquarium, the atmosphere of Jade Palace guarantees a memorable experience.   Opening the doors to Jade Palace around 6:20 in the evening, my family and I are immediately hit with a crowd waiting for a table. There was a long list and we were told there was a 45 to 50 minute wait. While waiting for a table, you can look at a menu, vie for a seat in the cozy chairs, get a refreshment at the bar, and enjoy the fish swimming around in the mini aquarium, including a pufferfish! Despite the interesting views, the waiting area is rather small because of the little distance between the door and the hostess stand, and the hostess stand is also used as the area for pick up orders.  We were seated after 48 minutes, so I suggest having a reservation. Once we were seated, our smiley waiter approached our table promptly and took our drink/appetizer order. Jade Palace offers Pepsi products, and a variety of other drinks on their menu. For appetizers, we got 4 vegetarian spring rolls for $8.50 and 6 pan-fried dumplings (you have the option to order steamed dumplings as well) for $9.95 served with sauces. For my entree, I ordered the Szechuan Garlic Chicken for $13.50. It was very flavorful and tasty. The portion sizes of the entrees were definitely shareable. My entree came with green peppers, carrots, chiles, and water chestnuts. Each entree comes with a bowl of rice, which can be refilled upon request. My family and I were given one bowl of rice to start with for our five entrees. After we were finished, we clearly needed boxes. The waiter boxed up our leftovers, and packaged them in a easy-to-hold bag. It was nice to not have have to package up my own leftovers! My family and I enjoyed are time without any pressure from the waiters to hurry up. When the check was delivered, so were the complimentary fortune cookies. On our way out, the waiter showed his politeness and training when he thanked us.  Jade Palace is a delicious, Chinese restaurant with a large assortment of food options and a calming atmosphere. The hostess and the waiter were cordial and helpful, my only complaint is the small waiting room and the missing warning about the large portion sizes. Despite those minor issues, I will not hesitate to dine at Jade Palace again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this place was down right awful. No flavor. The staff was friendly, but the food.. Just not what I was hoping for. I personally would pass on this place. Unless you want food with at is very bland."}
{"text":"We been going to Jade Palace for years and have always loved their food.  We've found the Pinnacle Peak store to be a bit better overall than the Shea store, however, we were very disappointed in the Shea store after a take out order on 5/12/2013.    The quality of the food was not very good.  We ordered BBQ spare ribs...very little meat on the bones.  We ordered pork fried rice...very little pork and very little flavor.  We ordered shrimp in lobster sauce...very watery and little flavor.  We order orange chicken...very little chicken covered in bread, lots of fat and little flavor.  Not sure if there is new ownership or if they were having a very off day...."}
{"text":"This is just like a New York style Chinese place. We never order off the menu, we just yell Hugh what we want and he makes it happen. Thanks for the consistency!!!"}
{"text":"Jade Palace reminds me of the East Coast Chinese food that I used to have.  The New York egg rolls are fantastic, and the duck sauce is an A+.  They used to have cold sesame noodles on the menu, which is one of my favorites and hard to find in Chinese restaurants here in AZ, but if you ask, they will make it for you.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it is comfortable and very upscale.  The prices are moderate and the portions generous.  Their lunch specials are terrific!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday, and though most times I want to pick the most extravagant restaurant I can find to celebrate, this night I had a hankering for Chinese. It's been forever since I've had Chinese, and the only place I've ever liked in the North Scottsdale area has been Jade Palace on Shea. We've now moved to way, way North Scottsdale, so it was time to try out the sister restaurant at the Pinnacle of Scottsdale Plaza.  I don't know what it is about this complex, but it houses two of our other favorite restaurants . . . Toyama (for Japanese) and Parmigiano Italian Bistro. Jade Palace made it a perfect trifecta!  First of all, I was surprised at how large the space is, and you would never know from the outside what a lovely patio they have. The perfect evening weather made it a no-brainer to sit outside. It faces a little water feature, walkway bridge and lots of foliage. Except for the noise from Jalapeno's across the way, I felt like I was in another world.  Tables are spaced well so you don't feel like you are on top of any other diners.  When we arrived, we were welcomed by everyone, including the owner.  They have a nice little bar area, and the waiting area has plenty of room if you have to wait for a table. But we didn't have to wait since we called forty-five minutes ahead and made a reservation.  After all, it was a Saturday night. I loved, too, that they had live instrumental music which was perfectly toned and didn't interfere with conversation.  Our server was polite and attentive but didn't have much personality. As I looked around, this seemed to be the case overall, except for the darling girl who also works at the Shea location who we've come to know from dining there for so many years.  No harm, no foul, in the service department.  The North Scottsdale location seems to have the almost identical menu as the Shea location as I remembered. My husband had the hot and sour soup which he claimed is the best in the valley, and maybe even better than any he's had anywhere!  They serve complimentary crispy fried wontons with hot mustard and the most divine duck sauce west of New York!  We also ordered the sauteed green beans which were so delicious I might just have to stop for takeout to have with our home prepared meals.  My husband had the special Chow Fun noodles. They are delicious!  All they need is a :drop\" of soy to compliment the flavors of the chicken, beef and shrimp amid the thick noodles. My favorite dish on the menu is the Home Style Bean Curd.  I have never tasted tofu and vegetables this incredible! The sauce is a little spicy but they will accommodate your preference of spicy, and I always get medium.    With the warm weather comes dining out more often so we don't have to heat up the kitchen . . . there is no doubt we'll be spending quite a few evenings somewhere in the Pinnacle at Scottsdale Plaza, Jade Palace included!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Would definitely return. Reservations needed because place is really busy."}
{"text":"Jade Palace is an \"at least once a week\" dining venue for us and we are never disappointed.  On occasion, there is an evening that is so special, it will go in the \"Memory Book\".  Tonight was one of those.  Booking our Chinese New Year's Dinner for 8 back in January, we were all looking forward to a nice evening - I don't think any of us thought it would be absolutely fabulous evening.  It started when the 8 of us were escorted to a special room with our round table for 8.  The Owner came in and greeted us and explained how the \"special menu\" would take place and that it would be a dining experience of at least 2 hours......we actually stayed almost 3 because it was that good AND that enjoyable.  The food and service was first class - the New Year's Dinner Menu was amazing and we all agreed, we can't wait another year to do it all over again!  We highly recommend Jade Palace any evening - but don't miss the opportunity next year to join them in celebrating their New Year's!  Thanks to the Owner Devlan and to the entire staff for making this an evening none of us will soon forget!"}
{"text":"I am spoiled by the many Chinese restaurants in my state,  in San Francisco and in Southern California.   Having a craving for Chinese food in North Scottsdale,  I checked Yelp and found Jade Palace with good Yelper reviews.  It is down the road from where I am staying.   The staff was friendly and we were seated without reservations(they asked) on a week night.   Ordering family- style, we started with the won ton soup.   The broth had good flavor and had good -sized pieces of chicken and shrimp,  but the won ton wrapping was starchy,  making this a disappointment.   Our soup was followed plates of Mongolian beef (which was lost in too many onions), chicken lo mein, baby bok choy that was just okay,  and a specialty plate, Four Seasons, containing a stir fry mix of bbq pork,  scallops, jumbo shrimp,  and chicken.  Of our entrees, I enjoyed the Four Seasons.  Note that the entree serving sizes are smaller than the average than I have eaten at similar restaurants.  There is plenty of parking in the mall."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Jade Palace for 9+ years. Take out, dine in and hang at the bar.  Reviews on food are subjective as everyone has different tastes and expectations but I will say that over the years we have never been disappointed. The staff is very nice and the management is top notch. If you are adventurous, ditch the menu and ask for Hugh the manager.  ( If he's not there then scan the specials. ) Tell him the type of Chinese food you like and let him select your courses for you along with wine pairings.  You may get things off menu and uniquely prepared which makes for a fun experience. Also, if it's not too busy ask Hugh for a special dessert. Tell him Mr. B set you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Chinese food! Service is great,  food is delicious, place is neat. Definitely recommend. Coworker and I go almost every week for lunch. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Ordered from door dash...no napkins utensils or sauces...called manager, blamed door dash....sewer service!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Jade Palace for several years now. The service is amazing, the food never disappoints us no matter what we order and the prices are reasonable. The waiters are very accommodating and very friendly. We've never had a bad experience at Jade Palace. My favorite is the crispy orange beef over brown rice with a glass of Pinot Grigio, of course! Don't do anything different, Jade Palace! You're doing everything just fine!"}
{"text":"If you live in North Scottsdale, this is the ONLY Chinese food restaurant people eat at.   Everyone seems to love it.  Me?  I have a severe shell fish allergy so i avoid.  But friends picked it and my husband loves it.   We get there and I settle on BBQ spareribs for me, safe right?  The others share delish dishes like scallops and beef in some yummy sauce.  So WHY the 5 stars?  I tell the server I have an allergy.  The mgr, Dimitri, comes to our table and tells me the BBQ spareribs have oyster sauce.  Yikes!  And, he recommends other dishes which are prepared in separate pans.  I select a great Lemon chicken and egg roll.  Most importantly, I left healthy!   THANK YOU JADE  PALACE for the rare and EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I love jade palace. Sure it might not be the most authentic Chinese food (I've been to China, I get it) but nonetheless it's still ultra delicious. The owner/manager not sure who he is is always there and he is super welcoming and friendly.   I love the vegetable chow fun is my favorite thing to get. The New York eggs rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Valley and as a teenager we'd visit Jade Palace on Shea at least every month or two.  Then I moved to another part of town and found a local Chinese restaurant near me that I came to enjoy on a regular basis.  Well, I was meeting a group of college friends for a late lunch on Xmas day, and Jade Palace was central for many of us so we gathered there.  Server was nice, but not amazing (when 20% tip is automatically added to the bill for a group of 12, I expect top-notch service).  Food was good too, with a decent portion size and flavor.  Nothing amazing, but it was good food in a nice place.  However, what really shocked me and my guests was... #1) the very limited menu (it was just 1 page, large type, with only 3-4 chicken dishes, 2 noodle dishes, a few beef and shrimp entrees and 2-3 soups/appetizers like egg rolls.)... and #2) the ridiculous prices!  Because of Xmas, they took away most of the menu options AND they jacked up the prices on EVERY item that they did offer.  These weren't special holiday recipes or entrees, just increased prices on their everyday items!  (Our server confirmed this, and tried to justify it as \"not many places are open today\").  I tried to order moo-shoo, but was told they wouldn't make it.  It was an assembly line process, with some of their more popular items premade in bulk, offered over-the-top prices.  If I want that type of food, I'd go to the fast food Chinese place (and save $$ too).  WOW!--  That's not what the holiday spirit is all about.  It's because you are one of only a handful of places open on Xmas that you do so well.  The wait was long, but I doubt anyone choosing to dine there anticipated the limited menu or raised prices. The owners are greedy, taking advantage of loyal regulars and new customers who decide to give them a try on this day.    It's sneaky, it's wrong and I vow to NEVER step foot in or oder from this place again."}
{"text":"absolutely awful!!!! two dishes had pieces of black hair in it!!! they are definitely failing some health codes violations!!! gross gross gross"}
{"text":"Jade Palace is my favorite Chinese Restaurant. The food is delicious and the wait staff is very attentive. Every year we go there for Peking Duck which is OUTSTANDING. I love the fact that the Manager is so welcoming, too. Best Chinese Restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"We eat here probably once a week in the restaurant or take out. I love that the quality is the same for both. My favorite dishes are the Kung Pao Chicken, and General Tso Chicken- highly recommend if you like spicy. My husband gets the chicken fried rice, and my daughter the lo mein or orange chicken - all of which we highly recommend. The staff is always very friendly and greet us when we arrive. We are so glad to have found a wonderful Chinese restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"Poor service is putting it too kindly. In fact in this day and age, I can rightly fully say it was downright racism. They weren't even subtle about it. We walked in on a Friday night and they were fairly busy but we were seated within 10 minutes. However, it quickly went downhill from there.  The server came by fairly quickly, but we still needed some time with the menu. But then, she decided not to come back.. even after we summoned her. And yet she had time to serve and make chit chat with the people at the tables around us. Then, after she *finally* came by and taking our orders, for another 15 minutes we never saw our drinks or anything else. So I asked her again for our drinks, after seeing her refill the glasses of several of our neighbors, she dismissed me with \"he will get it for you when he is free\" (pointing at the table busser). Now he clearly didn't get her message, as he was standing around looking for people to refill their water glasses. And so at that point, after more than three incidents of non-service, we just ditched the place.   So you're wondering where the racism was? Bad service was bad service right? Well, when the Asian server in a Chinese Restaurant is diligently serving everyone else (who were all white) and just paying my table (2 Chinese Americans) lip service, well that just smacks of dining in the segregated deep south in the 60s.  I hope one never has to experience that kind of treatment here or anywhere else. But you have to wonder... if they do this to someone, could they do this to you? Even if you've never gotten the same treatment, how would you feel about this establishment knowing that they discriminate?"}
{"text":"So this place literally ruined Christmas for us. My wife and Iare  from CA and we miss having Roast Duck. We have always heard how great this place is and have always wanted to try it out. I called a few days before Christmas to see if they were opened on Christmas/Christmas Eve, and they were! Great, so I asked if they sold Roast Duck which they did, and had asked how early I should place my order since I wasn't sure if they would run out. They had told me that they would have it and would only need to order it 25-30 min in advanced. So we call today, which I believe was the same person I had talked to the other day, and they said they don't serve Roast Duck, and that they only serve off their \"Special Christmas\" menu. We were absolutely furious. We will never go here, regardless whether or not the food is good."}
{"text":"I'm a jewish man from NY. I know my italian food and my chinese food. This is the best chinese restaurant i've been to out here. The steam fwied dumprings & crab pruffs are incredible. The Shrimp grand marnier is out of this world. My girlfriend usually get the sweet and sour chicken and she loves it. Go here and go to sweet republic which is RIGHT NEXT DOOR for ice cream which is the best ice cream in the universe. You're all welcome"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese in Arizona. Food is fantastic but is a little pricey. Always leave with a happy. Great service and clean decor"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu. A big fan of the NY Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"The food here does not seem fresh. We ordered for take out one day and  chicken was rubbery. Very bad tasting as well. I would never go again"}
{"text":"Good decor, food same best American Chinese you can find in Phoenix, I like  crispy duck, sizzling soup is must soup for me"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch because I was craving Chinese food and Sweet Republic and killing two birds with one stone seemed like a great idea.  For $10 i went with the Kung Pao Three Delicacies lunch special. The scallops, shrimp and beef came in a tasty sauce, served with an egg roll, crab puff and fried rice. THIS WAS A GREAT LUNCH, and totally killed the craving for decent Chinese food that had my stomach growling. I also tried the famous NY Style egg roll which was worth all the fuss.  I am not saying that this is the best Chinese restaurant in AZ, but for what it is it's pretty darn good. I'd definitely stop by for lunch again anytime."}
{"text":"SO Sad. This particular location has closed, due to lower traffic. The location on 92nd street and Shea is still open, as is their other one. They deliver for a few bucks, which is great since I can't always leave the office for lunch but I still want my JP!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the great reviews, I expected something great and we didn't get it. Now we did go for lunch and this might have made a difference. Our service was awful though. The waiter dropped off the check and we got the payment ready. 10 minutes later he still had not come back and we had remembered someone paying up front and went oh we probably pay up there. As we were walking towards the front, he came back and went excuse me, you pay me. The food was mediocre at best. My mongolian beef was tough and fatty. My friend had the orange chicken and said it was also tough. Maybe their lunch menu is different than their dinner menu, but we won't be back to try. I have had much better at other places and will continue going there."}
{"text":"Love this place,  great service and you can't go wrong with anything you order!  We come back again and again..."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food. The New York egg roll was too greasy. Had this twice while in Scottsdale and it didn't disappoint either time"}
{"text":"Was here multiple times and had a great experience, best American/chinese place in Phoenix. tried multiple items on menu, and never disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jade Palace for years!  They are the BEST!  Their food is wonderful.  The new place has great decor and modern.  Devlon and Hugh are super, they always make sure you are happy with the service and food and come up to the tables all the time.  Great customer service!  Have tried other Chinese restaurants, but none compare.  Highly recommend!  It's worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Chinese New Year 2014 - I have a table for 2 at 7-30pm on Jan 31st Stand by, for what I hope is a glowing report after tonights meal"}
{"text":"The potstickers were bland and had no flavor. The sauce didn't have any flavor either. The General Tso's Chicken(all white meat) was not good. The chicken had a texture that was stringy and there were gristly parts as well. It was a very low grade of meat. There is no excuse for that. Now I know why I haven't been back in 10 years. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Went here spur the moment while in Scottsdale,az so happy we decided to do so! Delicious food and excellent service!  intimate atmosphere especially after sun down.   Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"American 'Chinese' No authentic flavors, mostly geriatric scottsdalians.... Fair service. Unfortunately Scottsdale doesn't have any over the top Chinese. Too bad."}
{"text":"The moo shu pork and chicken fried rice at Jade Palace are amazing! By far my favorite place to eat chinese in AZ and if you like moo shu you will flip for it here.  Service was good, food amazing and I am already craving to eat there again next week!"}
{"text":"Still the best Chinese food in North Scottsdale . Even more convenient since they moved to new location."}
{"text":"My sister lives in Phoenix and loves to go to Jade Palace, both on Scottsdale Rd and Shea locations!  This place is elegantly decored yet with authentic Cantonese and regional cooking from China.  We are born and raised in NYC Chinatown and are the pickiest about true Chnese cuisine.  Well Jade Palace has it right!    Having spent five years in Hong Kong- Central, Mongkok, and Wanchai, some of the best chefs in the world reside there.  Well now with Chinese Food Scottsdale (Jade Palace), we have found their counterparts in Scottsdale, Arizona!"}
{"text":"Egg rolls are really good! They're super big with a cinnamon flavor on them. Must try!"}
{"text":"Basically an excellent dinner!!! Nice descriptive menu with lots of choices PLUS nightly specials too!    The dumplings were quite quite good, Kung Po shrimp  (my absolute all time FAV!) was DEELISSSH & the bonus was it did not include green bell peppers, so I liked it EVEN MORE!    The noodle dish the Hubs ordered was good not overwhelmed with oyster sauce, soy sauce etc, just great freshly made noodles with shrimp. Calamari steak pounded, breaded & cooked to a golden brown was gobbled up very quickly ~     This is a pretty good sized restaurant with a full bar area ~ be sure to make reservations as they are ALWAYS busy according to our friends who live in the area~ our server who was not Asian, was excellent making sure the orders were correct then checking back to make sure everything was fine.     If you like Chinese, stop in I can't imaging you'll be disappointed as the management & staff along with the food are some of the BEST EVER ~"}
{"text":"Since moving from Vegas we've been searching for our go to Chinese place. Unfortunately living in Fountain Hills has severely limited our options. While the community is a lovely, pleasant enough city to live in, we've tried all the places the locals have recommended and have been severely disappointed.  Another local recommended that we leave FH and try Jade. We went to Jade last week for a late lunch at 4:00 PM and was surprised that the restaurant was empty.  We ordered pan fried dumplings, combination fried rice, combination kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef. Be warned my friends, this isn't your run of the mill hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, it tries to be white table so coming in dressed in work out clothes right after the gym and before their dinner rush probably wasn't such a good idea.  Back to the food...dishes at this place are not cheap. Don't think you're getting combination kung pao for $7.99 or even $9.99. Our chicken and seafood combo ended up being $20 plus dollars because of an up charge.  As far as tastiness and portions, it was nothing special, and not even enough to take home like most Chinese places, in fact the entire experience reminded me of Panda Express. So if you don't want to pay $40 or more for a Chinese dinner this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Took my mother out for her birthday and ordered the dinner for 4.  The appetizers were just a cut above fast food.  The main courses were ok except for the steak kev which came raw.  I give them credit for trying and the waiter was very nice.  Still, I am sorry I went."}
{"text":"Where to start... Have you ever eaten at Panda Express???  Well, if you have you will have enjoyed a better meal for sure.  After reading the mixed reviews I was a little leery about what to expect at Jade Palace.  I have to say that we were seated right away and the service was excellent throughout the meal.  As for the food, wow what a disappointment.  We ordered the wonton soup to start and it tasted like water with very little flavor.  Next we had some appetizers... beef skewers and pan fried dumplings.  The beef skewers had a very fishy flavor to them as if they were mixed with something fishy in the kitchen prior to being plated for us. The pan fried dumplings were not bad, but in the second one I bit into a rock hard piece of something that was the size of a small marble.  Maybe it was a bone or something, but I can't be sure.  Next the main courses.. we ordered the general Tso's Chicken which is kind of a staple at most chinese restaurants and all varying somewhat.  It was all breading and very little chicken to be found. What we did see was a mix of some white meat and majority dark meat. Overall not a tasty plate at all. We also ordered the Szechuan Shredded Pork and this was just plain simple. Thin strips of pork mixed with veggies which were not bad, but the pork was in some type of brown sauce with zero flavor.  So to sum it up, I will not being going to Jade Palace ever again.  There were just too many things that did not go right to even consider trying it again.  In all honesty, the best part of the meal was the noodles and duck sauce.  Yes that did remind me of my days back in NY and that was great.  However, in no way does this place resemble in any way shape or form NY style chinese food other than in the menu items offered.  If jade Palace were to open in NY it would close in a week.  I have eaten in hundreds of Chinese restaurants in NY from high end places like Chin Chin all the way to delivery places like China Fun and this place does not hold a candle.  Too bad as we love living here in Scottsdale, but the food quality leaves a ton to be desired as of yet.  We will continue our search and keep fellow Yelpers apprised of our findings, good or bad.  By the way, I have no bone to pick with Jade Palace, just being truthful.  When I find something good I will post about that as well with the same type of enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Love this place! The only true Chinese food we have found forever!! The food is great... the only place we can find Egg Foo Yong!! Service is also fabulous! Plus the owner is very entertaining if you are lucky enough to have him for a bartender!!"}
{"text":"I have been stopping by this establishment every week for the last 3 months. They are very kind and helpful. They are perfectly attentive to your needs and the food is wonderful.  If you go at lunch you will be pleasantly surprised. They offer a lunch combo that starts you off with either egg drop soup or hot & sour. If you ask for wonton its available for a small upcharge. Then on to the wonton chips with spicy mustard and sweet sauce. Then you plate arrives with just the right sized entree, rice, egg roll and crab puff stuffed with actual crab! What a concept!  Treat yourself, I do!!!!!!  By the way, all of that for under 10 bucks...."}
{"text":"My 6 year old was craving lobster today, so instead of cooking it myself or venturing to Red Lobster, I decided to go to Jade Palace for take out.   This was my first visit to the restaurant and it was a little hard to find. Located in a strip mall, Jade Palace is set further back than the other store fronts and I had to cross over a \"bridge\" to find the entrance.  After glancing over the take out menu quickly, I couldn't find lobster any where. So I asked the hostess if they served lobster. Luckily for me, the manager overheard and said they had one lobster left. I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, ginger scallion lobster with e-fu noodles and saut√©ed snow pea shoots (dau miu). The chef at Jade Palace did not disappoint me and you received a thumbs up from a kid with very discerning taste.   We both agree that it tastes just as good as the chinese restaurants back home (NJ/NY).  I will definitely be frequenting this establishment, now I wonder if they serve dim sum....  A solid 4 stars. Why not 5? Becase I'm Chinese, if you give the highest score, there will be no drive or desire to improve and in our culture, there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"I tried Jade Palace at Scottsdale Road after we didn't like the one of Shea Blvd.  My husband really disliked that one and I convinced him to give this location a try.  It was rated higher on Yelp than the Shea location.   I had the shrimp with lobster sauce and chicken fried rice.  The rice was very tasty with an ample amount of chicken.   The lobster sauce had pork in it which is NY style.  Really delicious.  10 large shrimp cooked perfectly.   Hubby's Orange chicken was not over crusted (that's the usual problem with this dish) but there were no \"orange\" flavors.  The only thing that connected this dish to \"orange\"  was the garnish of one half slice of orange on the plate.  There was a dark brown sauce that tasted nothing like orange.  It was spiced up enough just as he requested, however, he would not order this dish again.   The servers were attentive and the management came by to ask how everything was. Now, I may be getting cheap in my old age, but I think $46.00 for two entrees and one small dish of fried rice is a bit much.  I like the location and the ambience of the place but I feel the prices are a bit high.  Perhaps I will try them for lunch if they have lunch specials.  My dish was really good  but I don't think hubby will be coming back any time soon.  That's 2 for 2."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has impressed me to the fullest. Came in late night and we were still served by happy, friendly staff and manager. Food was amazing - a little pricey but, well worth it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I just had to update my review because I finally made it to Jade Palace for dinner.   Lunch was always great but dinner was even better.  The dishes came out piping hot to the table and I have to say I was sure surprised at the portion sizes.  One definitely gets what one pays for here!    We ordered lemon chicken, an orange sauced shrimp dish (can't remember the name and their website is under construction so I couldn't check), a beef stir fry with veggies, panfried dumplings and Yang Chow fried rice (not 100% sure of the name).  Everything was so, so good.  The lemon chicken was so crispy and perfectly cooked and the shrimp dish was absolutely delicious and a very ample portion.  The dumplings were crispy and flavorful and the fried rice dish was something that I couldn't wait to delve into because it looked so good and different from most I've had at other restaurants.  They didn't stir fry it in soy sauce but instead left it alone and simply combined it with plenty of shrimp and veggies so it was still white and not oily at all.   There were two of us so we ordered too much food but the leftovers fed us again no problem.  We wanted variety - what can I say?!  We're returning again this weekend with a party of six and I can't wait to introduce our friends to this restaurant as they were complaining that they just couldn't find a decent Chinese food restaurant.  I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Egg drop soup for two (feeds 3) :  Tasty and warm but I had to add soy sauce to add a more salty flavor.  The noodles they give you with it are a little too greasy. General Tso's chicken was amazing--- light breading and flavorful sweet/sour type sauce .  Salt and pepper shrimp (7 of them) were good but a tad over-fried --shrimp were dry inside.   Service was attentive with plenty of water refills."}
{"text":"The meat quality is low - perhaps suitable for canning but not for serving at a restaurant. I do not eat here for this reason."}
{"text":"Went to Jade Palace for the first time this past week.  I've got to explain the 3 stars because based on the food, it would probably be closer to 4, but our overall experience wasn't great - hence the 3.  A little background- the Hubs and I brought his Grandpa here for dinner.  His Gpa has Alzheimer's, so he needs help with the menu sometimes and definitely some patience.  Unfortunately, our waiter didn't offer either of these, which caused our dining experience to be a bit frustrating at the beginning.  Our waiter seemed abrasive and arrogant from the start, but it was only aggravated by the confusion during the ordering process.  For that reason alone, I take off some stars.  The food itself was served very fast and it was quite good.  The Hubs and I shared the mongolian beef and fried rice with bbq pork.  I loved the rice!  The beef was also good, but there really wasn't a good ratio of beef to onions... there were SOOOO... many onions and not nearly enough beef.  Grandpa had the shrimp chow mien, which he wasn't pleased with.  I think it mostly had to do with him ordering the wrong thing, but it really didn't look too appetizing (I didn't try it though).  So, I think the Hubs and I would go back despite this experience.  We don't have any other good Chinese places close by, so this would be a go-to spot for us.  The atmosphere is ok... we sat on the patio and there was live music next door for us to enjoy.  Inside is a bit out of date and stuffy, but the patio was nice.  Anyway, just my thoughts... I would certainly go back and recommend a friend to give it a try."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from here quite a few times now. We haven't been disappointed yet. We are hesitant to eat in as we have small children and the reviews tend to say they are not the most welcome.  Take out has been great, and very speedy. Food is always very hot and fresh. I wish there was a tad more seasoning to it, but after we add a little soy sauce it seems to help. It seems like the Shea location is a little better though.  We really like the Four Season, their NY egg rolls are the best."}
{"text":"To start off with, all the reviews about the age of the crowd here are ridiculous! God help you all when you are older! I truly hope you are treated as disrespectfully as you give. Want to avoid the \"older\" crowd? Don't go at the \"early bird\" time. Idiots.   Food was really good, we ordered to go after reading reviews as I didn't think I could be nice to people who were being disrespectful of the \"older\" crowd. The New York style egg roll was to die for. I haven't had a good egg roll since I was in China. Street food over there is to die for! We ordered fried rice, which we really enjoyed as it wasn't a sodium overload like a lot of places. The chicken and broccoli was also very good. It is a really solid place, I would go back. I am just truly disgusted with other reviews to be honest. Yelp needs to clean house."}
{"text":"Yet another awesome meal at the best Chinese food around. We had the good fortune to have Porter serve our table again. This young man has an exceptional eye for detail and takes his job seriously all while bringing a smile to everyone at our table.  U12 prawns in a garlic scallion sauce were out of this wold!  The three delights were very memorable with U12 prawns, U10 scallops and a wonderfully prepared piece of filet mignon.  Porter recommended the saut√©ed green beans and we are glad he did.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's the best Chinese food in the Valley. My family and I have been coming here for years and my boyfriend and I drove out here from east mesa so he could try it for the first time and he loved it! If you're anywhere near by, or not! you have to at least give this place a try. The wait staff was a little difficult to communicate with, but other than that, I really enjoy the food here!"}
{"text":"This was my second time for eating at the Jade Palace.  My first time was awesome!  Food was excellent and the service superb!  So I decided to bring my sister n law with me the second time.  A big mistake!!  Food was still excellent but the service was one of the worst I have ever had!  The waitress must have been new.  She brought out the wrong food and mixed our orders.  They finally got mine right but had to re do my sister n laws entire order!  I was very upset and embarrassed to say the least!  She never came back for re fills on our drinks, in fact she disappeared!  Another waitress had to deal with our unfortunate service!  It took the original waitress 45 minutes to bring our bill out!  The other waitresses were looking for her!  We thought maybe she walked out and quit.  Finally, someone came and took our bill up so we could check out.  I will think twice about coming back here and if I see that waitress still working there I will walk out!!  The first time is a 5 Star Rating but the second time and the reason I am writing this so management can read I give it a poor rating!  Don't know if she was not trained, did not pay attention during training or just totally a poor uncaring waitress!!  :("}
{"text":"I was craving some quality Chinese food and after searching through yelp for 15 minutes, I decided to come to Jade Palace. It's so hard to choose a Chinese food restaurant when their reviews are all over the place. So anyways, I had a party of 5. Our waitress was super sweet and very attentive to us. My boyfriend ordered the szechawan chicken (he said that's how it's spelled but I'm sketch....) and he thought it was delicious. I ordered the orange chicken. The flavor was good but some of the pieces were too dry to even swallow. This may sound weird but their soy sauce had a \"tap water\" taste if that makes sense to anyone.. I ordered the chicken lo mein for my kids and they tore it up.. I tried it and it was a little too bland for me. Overall, the food was alright. I'm still in a desperate search for the perfect orange chicken."}
{"text":"Being a Jersey girl, I still can't grasp the fact that I need to get on the highway for chinese food but it's worth the journey.   This has been the go to take out chinese food spot on xmas eve for years now but I've never been inside till last night. It's got a great atmosphere and the best chinese in town!   Though i'm not a vego, chicken from restaurants usually freaks me out. For some reason I still went for two chicken dishes & I'll be real with you, they were both legit.   My freshman year roommate, Roxy- a brooklynite even munched both dishes and gives it two thumbs up as well.    GO TO DISHES: MUSHU CHICKEN (ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE FOR SURE)  CHICKEN LOMEIN   If i could change one thing, it would be the NY egg rolls. If they were really NY egg rolls, they'd take the jews in consideration and have a non shellfish option here!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from the Bay Area, we were in search of some good Chinese food since it had been almost 3 weeks.  I looked on yelp for suggestions and this restaurant popped up...with nothing to lose, we decided to go try it out.  Walking in, it gave off the ambiance of a PF Changs, but letting that vibe slide we decided to give it a try.  The hostesses were young girls in short and tight skirts, they seem like they were dressing up to go clubbing instead of working at a Chinese restaurant.   Walking to our table, I noticed that the clientele were mainly older folks dining on Chinese food accompanied by a glass of white wine.  Our waiter came over to take our order and we were given a choice of having either white or brown rice, or you could have the option of having half and half.    A bowl of wonton chips along with a side of sweet and sour sauce and yellow mustard arrived as we got our drinks.   Our dishes come all at once. The waiter comes and sets up a serving stand and all the dishes are set upon a large tray. I noticed that most everyone in the restaurant ate a la carte style, while we ate family style so we shared all the different dishes.    I soon found out that if you want chopsticks, you are going to have to ask for them at this restaurant.  General Tso's chicken - fried pieces of chicken in this sweetened dark brown soy sauce with a bit of spicy kick. It was pretty good.  Shrimp with lobster sauce - no real lobster in sight but this was a dish where the shrimp had a nice almost brothy sauce over it. Traditionally, it should have black bean in it, but we didn't find any in this version of the dish.  Twice cooked pork - we were actually looking forward to this dish the most as it is fairly labor intensive, given the name the pork should have been cooked twice so it would make it very tender.  Instead, we were surprised and not in a good way to see that they used Chinese bbq pork (char siu), which is lean and harder. This type of bbq pork /char siu is often used in bbq chow mein or fried rice, but definitely not the type to used for \"twice cooked pork.\" Although there is an argument that the bbq pork had in fact been cooked once already, so now they are using it in another dish with dark soy sauce and green onion it would satisfy the \"twice cooked\" portion. Booo!  I think the manager was Chinese, and he definitely catered to the Caucasian crowd.  Prices are higher than most Chinese restaurants, but given the PF Chang feel I can't say I'm surprised.  On the weekend, sometimes they have a musician playing the 7 stringed zither (gu jung)."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out I have ever had ! Very very pricey ! But absolutely worth it ! I have a few different things on there menu an all where great and good size portions ! The down sides are how pricey an that they charge 5 bucks extra for delivery and don't give that to there drivers also I wanted to substitute white rice for the fried rice and was willing to pay extra but they wouldn't budge at all on that !! So I ended up telling them to keep the white rice an I ordered a side of fried which was 7.95 a piece ... You would think they would compromise a little I spent over sixty bucks on take out ! But overall food was fantastic when it arrived to bad won't be able to afford to have it anytime soon !lol"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Delivery is always fast and they are very friendly at the restaurant. The bar tender was funny and had me and my buddy cracking up. I have order from here about 20 times. Order is always right!"}
{"text":"This is the most elegant Chinese restaurant that I know of in the Valley. The last location by Scottsdale Road was also nice and cosmopolitan, once inside. The food is always good and sometimes a special is GREAT. The ambience makes you want to have wine. They have it! I want to have that Peking Duck. I have dined at Jade Palace multiple times and enjoy all the locations, however this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"I am gluten intolerant, so I have only tried 1 thing on the menu... Which is AMAZING, so it's fine by me!  I always have the chicken lettuce wraps... Sounds boring, right? Nope! Delicious! And very filling.  (The sauce they offer is not gluten free and they do not have GF soy sauce, so bring your own) He has the lettuce wraps and sometimes the Pepper Steak which he says is absolutely fantastic! He also had the green beans and I tried 1... Wow! Delish! Nice restaurant for families or date night with great food!"}
{"text":"Always great! Consistently amazing food and high quality service. I've eaten here at least 35 times in the past three years and have had about everything on and off the menu. Best Chinese in the area hands down."}
{"text":"We went here for Christmas.  I got an unwelcoming creepy vibe there.  Any pleasantries from the staff seemed forced and fake.  The food was on par with Panda Express."}
{"text":"We've been to the Jade Palace at Scottsdale/Pinnacle Peak a number of times but always for lunch.  This was our first visit to this location and our first dinner at Jade Palace.  Our party of four shared the Four Seasons, Mongolian Beef, lo mein with shrimp and Cashew Chicken.  The dishes came with a big bowl of white rice and another bowl of brown rice.  If these four dishes are representative of the rest of the menu then you should be happy with anything you order.  The service was very good and the prices were reasonable ($17/person).    The three major Asian restaurants in my part of the world are Jade Palace, Flo's and PF Changs.  I'd rate them exactly in that order.  Will we be back - Shi (that's yes in Chinese - I looked it up)."}
{"text":"The Jade Palace in North Scottsdale is our \"go-to\" Chinese restaurant.  As an ex-New Yorker, Chinese food is especially important to me and Jade Palace is what I would consider the best in Scottsdale.  My entire family agrees.  We always start off with an appetizer.  The ribs are excellent and served with Duck Sauce like in New York.  We love their egg rolls and their lettuce wrap is great.  The soups are also very good with lots of flavor.  Something neat is to use the Egg Drop soup as the basis for the Won Ton Soup.  I cannot leave out my wife's favorite, shirmp stuffed egg plant in a black bean sauce.  The main dishes that we love are varied.  My favorites are the shrimp and lobster sauce.  This is a tasty dish served with enough shrimp to make it filling.  We also love the sweet and pungent shrimp.  My wife's favorite is the orange chicken which she prefers hotter than I like it so we always tone it down.  The house lo mein is a standard with our family and it goes rapidly.    We have had parties over the years at the restaurant where they made Peking Duck or Lobster dishes for us and they were remarkable.  They always accomodate requests and come up with flavorful dishes.  The cost is what I would call moderate.  When it is the two of us, we usually spend about $50 and bring home left-overs.  The service has also always been excellent and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Very good service and food was terrific. We had the vegetable egg foo young and the moo shu chicken. A little pricey but the atmosphere is definitely a notch above most Phx Chinese restaurants. We went to the new location just off of Pima Rd and Pinnacle Peak Parkway. We will go back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley because I will travel from Prescott for their delicious food. I'm NEVER disappointed, because they are consistent. I have probably had everything on the menu since I've been going for the last 4 years. If you want REAL authentic Chinese food. This is your place!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place for years but didn't see it. Tried it today for the first time. If you like really good Chinese food you must eat here. Very nice atmosphere. Excellent service. Some of the best Chinese food we've ever had. Egg Foo young was outstanding. Sizzling beef and scallops was outstanding. Drinks were excellent. My new favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Christmas Dinner and it was fantastic! Yes the line was long but James took great care of us the entire time we were there.  The food was flavorful and greatly portioned. The beef dish I ordered was delish and made for great leftovers. Crab Puffs are the real deal not the usual \"Krab\" pufs that over-fried cream cheese and the egg drop soup was FANTASTIC! Some of us needed a bit more spice and they brought out a nice assortment of two spice toppings not just a bottle oft sauce that put an extra punch into the already great meal.  The bar pours were on point, servers were fast and friendly despite the Christmas chaos.  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese I've had in Arizona.   Flavors and dishes are excellent and really resemble some of the great Chinese restaurants in New York City.  Egg roll...exactly like the best in NY.   Spare rib appetizer consistently incredible.   Very friendly service, great atmosphere and truly consistently great Chinese.   We can't stay away :-)"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.... great food and great service!  I've eaten here many times and I've never been disappointed... my favorites are the New York egg rolls and the mushu pork. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The owner was quick in responding to my complaint.  He was apologetic and seemed genuinely concerned about our customer experience.  We all make mistakes but the way we handle them reveals who we are.  Thank you for listening."}
{"text":"Really fresh. Always delicious. A little pricey. But we call that \"N Scottsdale pricing!\"  Order the tangy shrimp"}
{"text":"The food- great The menu- great Prices- fair (high prices for high quality) The service- unmatched (the mgr stopped by our table twice, the dish person was friendly, our waitress was lovely and on point)  Know before you go: average age of the clientele was 60-65 (packed house too- at 6:00pm), Elton John played in the background, it's a whisper-only restaurant not good for kids"}
{"text":"Food not genuine but is reasonably good. White rice was old hard and crusty.  I will have to find better Chinese and I will."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Chinese restaurant that's of a higher scale, and doesn't taste like you're typical all-breading Chinese place, you've just found it. The place is exquisite, and I can't recommend it enough.  The lemon chicken is some of the best I've ever had, perfectly cooked every time, in a delicious, light and sweet sauce. The same can be said about their other staples, like their sweet and sour, and general tsou's. The atmosphere is fantastic, classy, and tranquil. Service is impeccable. One some nights, they even have live music perform, and it's some of the best atmosphere I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  Unfortunately, I've since become a celiac, and can't have gluten. Their gluten-free options are very limited, but I can't mark that against them as it's kinda hard to make Chinese food without using flour. If you can eat gluten, this place is the chinese food lover's dream."}
{"text":"Refused to substitute extra veggies for rice for a friend who was just diagnosed with diabetes.  I've always loved this restaurant, and have eaten there frequently with my friends for many years. I couldn't believe it when my friend was told that they would not give her some extra veggies in lieu of rice after she told them she could not eat the rice for medical reasons.  Then, they went ahead and put the rice on her plate after she asked them to leave it off.  We'll be looking for a restaurant that's more accommodating to such a simple and necessary request the next time we want to get Chinese food."}
{"text":"I give this place a zero. I took my father out for dinner one early evening and we sat in the dining room. A fight between customers happened in the bar area because they had to much alcohol in their system. What an embarrassment. I will never return to this establishment ever again. The food was not even that good. So many other quality Asian restaurants than this one."}
{"text":"Jade Palace was amazing!  The atmosphere is elegant with a fine dining feel.  We arrived 15 minutes late for our reservation on a Tuesday night, but our reservations were still held!   The sweet and sour soup was perfect and very hardy.  The 2 chicken wraps that we ordered for an appetizer were flavorful and filling.  Our entrees were:  General Tso's chicken and Orange Beef.  We ordered a side of pork and noodles.  The Orange Beef is a must have.  It is literally addictive!  Couldn't stop eating it!  The General Tso's chicken was rated spicy, but seemed a bit mild unless you bit into one of the tiny red peppers.  The Pork noodles were bland.  Nice wine selection by the glass but a bit pricey.  This was our second visit!  We will return.  Great food, efficient staff and good ambience."}
{"text":"New beautiful restaurant. Same great food and drink with a few additions. Fabulous wine list..  The owners are wonderful hosts.  As for the wait staff, they are knowledgeable, friendly and will take special orders if possible. The  Peking Duck is to die for . The sweet  and pungent Shrimp are huge and spicy. Egg rolls are best in the valley. They also have nightly specials which are interesting and tasty. Also duck lettuce wraps are fabulous.  My regular waiter Francis is so professional!!!   Bottom line, the Jade Palace is a culinary exerience, Devlin the owner will ensdure a perfect experience. Give it a try, you will enjoy it.    Ron and Sandie T"}
{"text":"5 stars. Excellent place. Best Chinese food. Pan friend dumplings, and spicy chicken chow mein crispy.  Service is excellent. Staff is very alert to serve."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Wanted some good cold tea.  They told us it was Liptons, OH WELL!  Our NY Eggg Rolls and green bean appeizers were outstanding.  My shrimp schezuan lunch was fine,  My wifes Kung Pao Cjocken tasted a bit wierd.  The chicken was kind different tasting.  My wife aearound it.  We prefer the place up north."}
{"text":"Consistently the best Chinese food in the North Valley period. Tasty food, classy atmosphere and live music on weekends. Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"mediocre Chinese food, good service, reasonable prices, pretty restuarant.  meh. wish the food was tastier!"}
{"text":"What a time to forget my phone!  For our 50th anniversary we went to the Jade Palace on Shea. Super delicious, General Taos Chicken was the best.  It's one of our favorite restaurants. I can truly recommend Jade Palace to all."}
{"text":"This place has excellent Chiense.  I'm not sure why, there is always only one or two tables filled when you go inside - it's good good eats though if you're looking for chiense!"}
{"text":"took the whole family here for grandpa's birthday, and they were SO great. The waitress made sure to get everything to us quickly. We shared the duck, orange peel beef, crab puffs and teriyaki chicken. very delicious. I also had my first ever Cosmopolitan which the owner came over and asked how it was. I will tell you, it was great.   For dessert they brought him ice cream with hot fudge and candles, and sang to him in Chinese. so cute.   A little pricey, but a great meal."}
{"text":"The food is very good but I do not like how the bus boys remove plates instantly after they look empty while other people are still eating and have not finished the entr√©es. It's not polite nor comfortable."}
{"text":"I LOVE this little place.  It is around the corner from my office, so obviously extremely convenient.  But I was really pleased when a co-worker and I asked if we could be seated and served within our alotted half-hour lunch that day, and the server said, \"Absolutely!\"  He was right.  I think the price cannot be beat: soup, main meal, and a couple of additional appetizer-type additions for a mere $6.95!  What is really terrific is that this is no average Asian restaurant.  It has some atmosphere, so the great lunch prices are unexpected and a total BONUS!  I have already returned twice in the last month!"}
{"text":"We dined at the Jade Fountain last night and were most disappointed with the evening.  The restaurant is beautiful.  We had the hot and sour soup which was okay and ordered the four seasons and vegetable fried rice.  We modified our food order to meet our dietary needs.  We specifically stated no msg and no pork.  The main dish and rice at best were soso.   I believe our server mis-ordered our food as I strongly believe the food had msg.  The dishes didn't come close to meeting our expectations and were no better than a neighborhood Asian restaurant and way overpriced."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ from Colorado and was looking for a place with good fried rice on the north side of Scottsdale. After several people suggesting this place, I tried it out. The fried rice was very good, in fact, better than my usual in Denver! Good hot and sour soup too. Other food was good as well. I think I have found my take out Chinese spot!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff and patrons, fun place to go! I finally found a chinese restaurant I can go back again and again...everything is good: fried rice is great, the scallops are fresh and tasty...been there at least 5 times, every dish is good. Good drinks too"}
{"text":"Meh is what comes to mind. Expensive, very average American-Chinese food is what we got while being surrounded by a crowd straight out of Del Boca Vista (Think Seinfeld) For starters we ordered 2 very expensive New York egg rolls. The waiter described them as filled with pork, shrimp and veggies. I found no proteins in our egg roll. We also ordered sizzling rice soup. It was fine but no sizzle.  The mains were fine and generous but nothing really stood out. With a tip and no alcohol ordered we left $96 on the table."}
{"text":"For a quick take out Chinese this place is okay. We ordered the broccoli beef and the orange chicken plus BBQ fried rice  What I really like is that the broccoli is steamed so it is that bright green.  It is so inviting to eat. It The broccoli has a crunch and is not  a soggy disheartening visual nightmare that you encounter and try to convince yourself there is some nutritional value in it.   The broccoli is quickly pounced upon.  I guess this is the highlight of this dish The beef was tender to eat.   The orange chicken while sweet enough needed a little boost in the orange flavour and less batter   My suggestion would be to change fortune cookie that are handed out as they taste awful"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was very disappointed in Jade Palace with my experience in placing a to-go order with them. I placed a to-go order as a treat for my family (we love Chinese food) and had heard great thing about Jade Palace. When I called I asked for it to be ready at a specific time as I was driving from the opposite side of town and I provided them with about 45 minutes notice, totally reasonable. I ended up making great time and arrived about 20 minutes early knowing my order wouldn't be ready, however it was ready just sitting on the counter in front of me in a brown bag...no idea how long it had been there. By the time I got home it was completely cold and to make it worse my order was incorrect. All I had my mind set on was some BBQ pork low mien, I ended up with two dishes of shrimp fried rice instead. My son who was feeling under the whether was looking forward to the won ton soup, which he also didn't get but instead had some bowl of clear very sweet liquid (still not sure what it was), lastly my husband had a small bone found in the middle of the orange chicken dish which is never appetizing. I called the restaurant back and the manager was busy and I was told he would return my call, I called back hours later at the end of the night as I hadn't received a phone call, the hostess sounded annoyed and said he is still busy but that she would credit my card back for the items on my order that were incorrect and thats all I wanted. The following day I received no call...no credit to my credit card and the manager doesn't seem to care...it has been almost a week later and no phone call yet. I would not recommend placing a to-go order with Jade Palace and am extremely concerned with the lack of care by the management. Thanks"}
{"text":"March 2018:  we walked in with no reservation on a Friday night around 7 pm and although busy, we were seated within a few minutes.  We ordered crab puffs and the Royal Nest (scallops & shrimp).  Both were delivered hot and quickly.  The food was great as was the service.  The place was busy with several large groups.  It also has an interesting atmosphere.  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Authentic HK-style beef chow fun cooked to perfection (not soggy).  Spicy and tasty twice cooked pork (slightly oily), and spicy shrimp was delicious too.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have been to there former locations a couple of times, but that was over a year ago.  I get my haircut in the same center as there new location, so they were fresh in my mind when we found ourselves in the area.  So, takeout here we come.  Nice new digs, and the bar area is huge improvement.  We sat at the bar ordered a drink and ordered our takeout.  We ordered the Four Seasons and House Lo Mein.  As usual the food was ready in what seemed like seconds (How do Chinese restaurants do that?).  The Four Seasons was okay, but the beef is to be avoided.  It's spongy.  That's a bout the only way for me to describe it.  The shrimp were perfect and along with the sauce made the dish. The few pieces of broccoli were really good, but a few more veggies would have been great.  The House Lo Mein was nearly ALL noodles.  Not sure there was any shrimp, chicken, or pork hiding in all those carbs.  Staff was nice and service was fine.  The menu is huge and I'll go back and try other items.  The search for great Chinese food in this part of the Valley continues."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Chinese, our first go to for any takeout besides Thai House. Everything is terrific year, never had a bad Dash. Mongolian beef is a favorite also beef and broccoli. Shrimp with black bean sauce is also terrific. Never been for happy hour in the bar but I do know they have a Chinese tapas menu and it always looks like people are having a ton of fun"}
{"text":"I love to eat here especially after I've gotten a facial at Melba's dayspa that's right next door it's the perfect after massage food they always serve you with a smilemy order is always right customer service is always on point and I haven't had anything that I haven't liked yet"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place.  I have gained 10 pounds since I discovered them.  They are great.  Those NY egg rolls are amazing and HUGE! One of my favorite dishes is the Mongolian beef, it comes with sliced onions and is delicious, sometimes I asked them to add bok choy and it is sooo good.  I also liked the vegetable fried rice and the jumbo shrimp with snow peas as well as the chicken with broccoli.  This place is so close to my house that when we call for take out the food is ready by the time we get there.  They have a nice bar and it looks like a lot of fun, my husband and I are going to check the bar during happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. Visiting from Toronto, we were looking for some decent Chinese food and didn't have high expectations. Tried several places in Scottsdale and found Jade Palace. The food may be a tad pricey but the food is good and the owner and staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"When you order delivery from here you get to eat with your screwdrivers or maybe a stick! Thank you."}
{"text":"Interesting experience. We decided to go out to dinner at Jade Palace for Chinese New Year, didn't realize others would too! It was packed and everyone had reservations; even the bar area. The manager tried to accommodate us best he could by 'reserving' the first table to get up in the bar. We sat down after about 20 minutes, server took our drink orders then came back for food. While ordering the manager came up to our table and politely asked if we could be moved into the dining room as a different party 'reserved' our table??? He stated he would compensate us with a drink or appetizer. Why not comp something we actually ordered?? Service was good, food was very slow but it was a busy packed night."}
{"text":"Highly, highly recommend this restaurant.  We have eaten there a couple of times and find the food outstanding.  The portions are large so we order appetizers, 1 entr√©e and 1 large side.  So much food we could barely finish....but saved room for the flourless chocolate cake with real whip cream.  The staff is fun, informative and attentive.  This is my favorite Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"I am uphauled, I used to like this place until...............................................  I went there with a few people and we started to have a good conversation with our waiter, he was nice and outgoing...A little too outgoing.  He quickly shared wit us that they advertise as no MSG but they infact do use it . In all of the soups and dressings and sauces!!!!!  If they blatenly lie about that what else do they do.  Bad ethics, eith er use it and say you do which of course would lose lot of business or just take it out.   I couldnt believe this, who can I report them to if you know?"}
{"text":"This is the only upscale chinese restaurant I know of in the area.  I really like the food at other (maybe more authentic) places but the atmosphere isn't what I want if its for a special occasion.  the food was pretty good and all the staff spoke chinese which my father in law needs.  Our only complaint was they have no Baijiu (chinese whiskey)."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food in Arizona.  I would easily give 5 stars if the place was a little cleaner.  I was especially disgusted with their filthy bathroom."}
{"text":"The restroom at this restaurant is really nasty dirty . They did remodel the place a while back and you can tell, but it's just not clean at all. They try to present a high class Chinese restaurant in the dining room, but if the restroom is so dirty , it makes you think how nasty is the kitchen."}
{"text":"NY'ers Get in your car and head here as fast as you can. Chinese is my ultimate fave food. I tried this place after hearing about it 4 years ago and haven't stopped going since. Yes its a hike from Arcadia, but who cares. Order the peking duck, egg-rolls and whatever else looks good to you. I eat here most Valentine's and Xmas. PEKING DUCK i love you! owner is cool as hell too. make a reservation b/c this place is packed whenever you go."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let you all know, from Asian to all the folks living in America. This type of Chinese food only existed in America. The menu is 100% white washed and the execution of the food is very poor.   The food tend to be overly favoring, the insane amount of salt and sodium in the entree, the overwhelming use of thickening agent at the hot and sour soup, everything is one eye roll and to the next  I will have to say, to be fair,  the service and ambiance are very good. The staff are actually very friendly and attentive. But having my years eating white washed Chinese food, I still have to say this is still not a good option for Chinese cuisine, let alone the complete misrepresentation of our culture  And to all the diners, if this is your impression of Asian cuisine. I hope you will have the opportunity to expose yourself to the authentic Asian cuisine. Chinese food is not all oil and grease, chicken and broccoli (exclusively available outside Asia)."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Jade Palace with my family for years. It is definitely one of the best Chinese Restaurants in North Scottsdale. The interior is very nicely decorated and the waitstaff is usually very attentive. I recommend Jade Palace for lunch because you can get a pretty large amount of food for a pretty small amount of cash. $8-10 will get you soup (the hot and sour is quite good), entree, egg roll, crab puff, as well as crispy won-ton to dip in mustard/sweet n sour sauce. A great deal! I know the owner here and he has always been very friendly, courteous, and eager to satisfy!   There are several dishes that I would recommend, the first of which being the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp. This dish is cooked in an amazing sweet and spicy sauce, and the shrimp are lightly fried and crispy, served with broccoli, completely delicious! Another stand out is the Hot and Spicy Eggplant dish. If you like eggplant you will LOVE this dish! It is served in a spicy Szechuan sauce which is a perfect complement to the mild eggplant. Lastly I recommend the Szechuan Garlic Chicken. This is a dish that you can get at any chinese restaurant but Jade Palace makes it especially well. The Szechuan sauce is perfectly flavored and balanced. There are many other fine dishes here, but I would stay away from the General Tso's, it is the only dish I've had here that I didn't like (and I usually love this dish at other places). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is as close to being in Chinatown as you are going to get.  Lived here for 22 years now and I am from back east and this is the only Chinese food I will eat.  Devlon and Leon know NY chinese food that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a pretty long time.  Definitely the best most authentic New York Style Chinese Food in town.   However, my experience has even become better with the help of a gifted waiter named Johann.  He hits it out of the ballpark on many levels.  Just plain incredible service and he makes sure my favorite dish over there is always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Just ok! Food was ok, Service was good. They played nothing but Phil Collins music the entire time we were there. I probably would not go back again as it is a bit of a drive and didn't really grab our attention."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, minus the hair which was not mine I found on my last bite. Gross!!!!! Lip stick stain on water glass, gross. The table next to us had a guy who sat in some kind of sauce and wearing khaki pants. Quite an off night for a place people rave about. Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Family Chinese Dining.  Good for groups and getting some of your Chinese food favorites.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.  Definitely come in a group so you can share the tasty dishes."}
{"text":"It feels as if we've eaten in Jade Palace a zillion times over the years and have always had a great time.   The food is very good, boarding on excellent. While the wait staff can be both inattentive and on top of you during the same visit. LOL But we keep coming back because it feels like home. It also reminds us of all those other great white table cloth Chinese restaurants we've eaten in over the years.   We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and Jade Palace was full swing, with a few tables just being bused. Lucky us! The wait was less than five minutes. We were able to be seated at a booth off to the side. It had both the advantages of being intimate, as well as tucked away and out of sight. We sat for long period before we were able to flag down the owners son. But we hardly noticed since we were having such a great conversation.   We were also fortunate on this visit to order off menu that delicious dish of Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce.  It was a reasonable $9.95, and a old favorite of mine. Sadly I couldn't make the same deal to get some Sichuan Won-Tons. Oh well, the Fried Pot Stickers for $5.95 were very good substitute!  Our appetizers were complemented by some Plum wine and LI Ice Tea.  My friend Marvin loves this place and so do we. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jade-palace-scottsdale-2?hrid=RRwVjbbyGOQSFkDY8VfAmA  For our entrees, we ordered the yummy General Tso's Chicken for $13.95 and the equally delicious Pork Lo Mein for $10.50. Both came with that individually prepared, layered taste that Jade is known for. We've eaten both here and the Jade up on Pinnacle Peak, but this is our favorite location.   Our bill came to just over $30 per person, including drinks and we left feeling well satisfied with this exquisite Chinese meal.   An energetic Four and half Stars, and yes we are most definitely Fans.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We were planning on going to Jalepeno Inferno last Friday, but when we arrived it was a madhouse. A man walking out advised me not go there so I convinced my guy to try Jade Palace instead. They were quite busy as well but were able to seat us immediately. We started with hot and sour soup and the bowl for two is huge. It was really tasty, as were the crispy wontons that they bring out with every meal at no charge.  For dinner I had the vegetarian egg foo young and J had szechuan chicken. Both dishes were delicious. They were also very generous and we had a great meal to take home with us. The service was top notch with our drinks being refreshed as soon as they got low without us having to ask. They are very attentive even when they are slammed and to me, that is the mark of a great restaurant. The prices were pretty good, the food was amazing and the service superior. Writing this is making me want to go there for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Loved the food at Jade Palace, my sister and I shared the sizzling rice soup which was really good.  Could use a little heat, but I like everything spicy.  My entree was the crispy orange beef and it was so good.  It had great flavor, even my leftovers were delicious.  I definitely recommend this place. House Cabernet was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Jade Palace for many years. The old location was a favorite and I'm happy to say the new location boasts the same great, fresh food, the same dedicated service and the same level of caring hospitality. New York egg roll, chicken fried rice, sizzling beef and scallops are dishes I have enjoyed over the years.. I like the new upscale decor as well as the bar area. Always a convenient and delicious choice in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The food is certainly not authentic Chinese but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had. The service was spot on. The server visually checked on us every five minutes or so and offered complimentary dessert at the end. Everything was perfectly cooked. All of the vegetables had the perfect amount of crunch to them and the meat was soft and tender.   Try the Double Dragon. It was perfectly cooked -- and just melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was fast and delicious.General Tsos chicken was great but but spicy as it is marked on menu."}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp with mixed vegetables are super yummy!  Beef lo mein was a bit disappointing although the noodles were flavorful.  Overall, the Jade Palace is a bit pricey for takeout but worth the price if dining in."}
{"text":"Our family have been going to this 2nd location in North Scottsdale since they opened.  The food is excellent.  They make egg foo young the way I used to love it most back in Chicago's Chinatown area in the loop.  The seafood, beef & chicken dishes are all made fresh to order.  The wait staff is very well trained and helpful.  They have several hostesses up front greeting you and handling the pick up orders.  We like to sit at the bar and watch all the action.  This place is run like a top.  The owner and his GM run a hands on business very professionally.  They have outgrown this building and moving a few miles east as of mid-April.  The new place will be twice the size and literally 50 feet from the front door of Mastro's Steakhouse at Pima & Pinnacle Peak.    Last night, the owner treated a few of us to their new appetizer.  Chinese chicken wings.  I was a little skeptical, but after one bite, had to take a dozen home.  Truly some of the best wings I've ever had.  Overall, I think this is the best Chinese food I've ever had.  And equally impressive is the genuine customer service they offer.  Nice job Jade Palace!"}
{"text":"Average food.  Good service.  Nice lunch combos consisting of an entree, soup, egg roll, and crab wonton for 7.99.  We also shared a side of the green beans, which were delicious.  I could make a meal of just those green beans.  The chicken with black bean sauce was tasty and light, with no yucky parts in the chicken.  I'm super-picky about that!    My friend's grandmother wanted chocolate ice cream, which they did not have (only vanilla and pistachio that day), so we asked if they could put chocolate sauce on the vanilla.  So they brought out this huge plate with 3-4 scoops of ice cream topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and maraschino cherries.  They really went all out!  Again, great service and not a bad place to go for lunch if you're in the mood for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food in Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is cool, the service is good and the food is just decent.  The place is packed though, so people keep coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese lunch.  Had the Mongolian Beef which came with soup, egg roll, wontons, crab puff, entree and fried rice.  My fortune cookie said I was going to be rich so I paid my bill and left with a full tummy and a smile on my face.  Great service and atmosphere... (But what would I know, I'm 82 and I ignore all those elder beaters!!!)"}
{"text":"Jade Palace has some pretty good chinese food and probably the best egg roll that I've ever had in Phoenix, the NY egg roll. My buddy and I stopped by for lunch not too long ago. The food was really good as far as AZ Chinese food goes. I had the garlic chicken lunch combo with lots of hot mustard and chili sauce. It was great! The prices for lunch were fairly standard, but I think the whole dish prices were a bit much when I think of grabbing some Chinese food. But, that my mindset so don't let that get in the way of trying this place. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant and the food is very good. Not your typical Chinese restaurant as the ingredients are very high quality and prepared and served as an upscale restaurant would. This is the type of food you would find in Hong Kong or Macau at the better Chinese restaurants before the British left. Cantonese but not your typical Cantonese food. Be prepared, it is a little pricey for Chinese."}
{"text":"Best Chinese place in Scottsdale. Food is always tasty and come quick after ordering. Service is great, bussers more attentive than some of the servers actually. Jade is my go to place for Chinese food in the east valley. Crab puffs are the best"}
{"text":"Sadly to say I went to not one but 2 Chinese restaurants in less than 48 hours and ended up disappointed by both! (See review for Luck Star Asian in Tempe). The Fountain Hills restaurant I was treated to by friends and it was great but I come to this location for the lunch menu and the House Special noodles weren't that great. I thought about eating in next time since they don't give the soup for takeout but hesitant to because what I usually order that tells me whether the Chinese is good or not is House Egg Foo Young. Over priced for the portions and taste. Really surprised on this first time visit."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in AZ.  Sure, I went on Christmas eve so it was a mad house but they managed it wonderfully.  We were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation, our waitress was relaxed and friendly, and the food came out surprisingly fast.  Because it was so busy I was worried about the diet Coke refill situation and was floored by the speed in which they came.    As far as my actual meal was concerned, here are the deets:  * The hot and sour soup was just ok.  It had an interesting smokey flavor that I couldn't quite place.  Also, the soup lacked all the meaty and shrimpy goodness I like in my hot/sour soups.  It wasn't horrible though.  * Their egg roll is the best in AZ hands down.  I've lived here for 15 years and have yet to find one like it.  For some reason egg rolls out west are teeny tiny compared to the ones back east.  Jade Palace nails it.  However, I still yearn for the duck sauce which very very few people who read this will understand.  * Best spare ribs I've ever had.  * The fried rice was interesting as well.  It was made fresh and full of great stuff, but the flavor just wasn't there.  Next time I'm going to add shrimp and pork as well as the chicken to see how that is, but I think Flo's may have them beat on the fried rice front.  * We split 3 other dishes and they were all excellent.  Not overly sauced, fried, or oily, and were full of fresh veggies.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give it a lower star?   My family decided to do Chinese take out on Christmas Day.  5 days prior I called to see what their process was for placing a take out order. I specifically asked if submitting my take out order would help with their holiday rush. They said it would definitely help and I proceeded to collect our family's order and call them back later that day with details.   Christmas Day had arrived and we had planned on picking the order up at 5:00. Grandma moo moo was very worried we might be late so we arrived at 4:40 just to be safe. We went inside the already VERY busy restaurant and gave them our name. They said it would be up in a few minutes and asked us to pay right away so we didn't have to worry about paying once we got our food.  The following is a breakdown of our full experience.   4:40pm: Pay and told it would only be a few minutes.  4:55pm: Overhear a woman beginning to raise her voice to the hostess only to find they told her a table would be ready in 10 minutes and she had been waiting for 65 already.  5:00pm: start seeing various take out orders appear from the kitchen. Grandma moo moo asks each time if they are for us.  Nope.  Overhear a man yelling about how it's crap he pays then is told nothing for another hour after his food was said to be up. Do not feel optimistic about the experience ahead.  5:15pm: Learn from a little girl who had been waiting 45 minutes for a reservation they had made for 4:30 that the fish in the fish tank is called a puffer fish.  Cool....now where the heck is the take out food. Moo moo is going to start worrying about Grandpa being at the house with guests showing off his toy trains for this long.  5:30pm: Man wearing bright patterned fleece PJ pants and fluffy slippers comes in for his 5:30 take out pick up.  He does not seem pleased when he is told it isn't ready.  5:45pm: Pretty funny to see a grown man in public sitting at the bar in fleece pj pants and fluffy slippers drinking a beer.   6:00pm: Realize the other people around us haven't gotten their food yet either and ask how early they ordered. 3 days was one reply and 2 days was the other.  6:10pm: Mr. 3 days early starts getting mad explaining he has 16 people at home waiting for food that was for pick up at 4:45. He demands a discount and they give him coupons for his next visit....sorry but based on his angry red face I don't think there will be a next time.  PJ pants and fluffy slippers is on his second beer.  6:15pm: Grandma moo moo and I text the family and ask them if a gas station chicken would be good. Drum up some support when we throw in we could also pick up slushies.  Proceed to ask if they could check on our order and see the gal walk away and avoid us as best she can when she returns. No answer received.  6:20pm: Mr. 3 days gets his food while apologizing to wife for 3rd time about delay, \"No honey, I didn't get lost they really were running this late!\"  Poor guy.  6:22pm: The food has arrived!!!  Pj pants and fluffy slippers is on beer number 4 I think.  6:23pm: Mr. 2 days asks if he can buy our take out for double the price since he's sick of being pestered by his super hungry family back at the house. Moo moo declines.  6:33pm: arrive back at Moo Moos where upon arrival my Grandfather welcomes her with big hugs and lots of concern as it's not often they are apart that long.  We can hear the toy trains are still going strong in the den where he had the rest of the family watching while they waited for food.  Family seems so pleased about the food they don't mention the exciting model train display. I trust it was awesome.  6:35pm: Realize we are missing one whole order of veggies and the extra rice we had requested. Oh well too hungry to care anymore.  Sucks for my vegetarian aunt though.   7:00pm: After woofing down food faster than I have in a long time, I proceed to finish it all off with my fortune cookie.  7:01pm: Cookie reads: \"Your honesty will take you far.\"  Ha....me maybe but I don't think it will be helping the Jade Palace much.   Next year - we are trying a different spot. What a mess."}
{"text":"Traditional Xmas Eve dinner with the fam. Fresh food and attentive, helpful service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once, but i cannot wait to go back! the service was phenomenal, the potstickers huge and delicious! the orange beef - just as good as a pf changs!  I had a restaurant.com coupon, purchased $10 gift card for .80 cents!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Jade Palace for almost 8 years now and been doing a lot of take out too.  This restaurant has authentic Chinese food and my favorite is the healthy chicken dish with steamed vegetables.  They also have a great wonton soup and the bbq pork fried rice that is actually cooked twice is awesome!  My family loves it.  The service is good and Leon takes personal care of his customers' needs when he is around.  Lunch is great too with an affordable lunch menu.  Definitely a restaurant that may be added to your favorite list..."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese Food.  Saying that is a lot since we live in Glendale and the restaurant is about a 30 minute drive but well worth it.  I am from New York and my Chinese food has to be really good.  Starting out, the BBQ Spareribs are just delicious and they have really good duk sauce to go along with them.  Also good are the egg rolls and the crab puffs.  We really enjoy the appetizers.  Our favorites are the Orange Beef or Chicken and the house special Lo Mein.  Both are the best that we have eaten in Arizona.  The shrimp dishes are especially good, very flavorful and rich with excellent sauces.  We have also sampled many other items on their menu and was always satisfied.  We come back often.  The people are friendly, the service is excellent and the price is reasonable.  Great restaurant."}
{"text":"I was starving and ordered a ton of  food for me and my family. I rarely eat Chinese but found the entr√©es bland and the brown rice bad. I'd try a different Chinese place before returning to jade palace.  I"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Jade Palace before!  My husband and I go there often and love it.  We've been living in the area for 5 years and Jade Palace was one of the first restaurants we found that we both really liked.  The inside of the restaurant is very nice, and we've always had really great service.  The food is top notch!  We've never had a bad meal there.  My husband's absolutely favorite is the hot and sour soup, he is a total hot and sour soup snob and he loves this one.  I often stop there just to pick up a big container of it for him.  The crab rangoons are really good too, not greasy and lots of filling.  The General Tao's chicken is one of our favorites but the sauce is a little different than most Chinese restaurants.  I absolutely adore the mu shu chicken and anything in kung pao sauce is divine.   The fried rice is really delicious too; we always order it with beef.  My new favorite is the chow fun noodles house special (pork, chicken and shrimp.)  If you like lo mein try the chow fun for something different.  Its flat rice noodles.  The lunch specials are really awesome too.  I think they range from about $7-$11, you get your choice of egg drop soup or hot and sour, a main entree, fried rice, a spring roll, and a crab rangoon.    We get a lot of takeout from Jade Palace and the takeout orders are huge.  They also deliver.  Just a warning, anything marked spicy will NOT be spicy.  If you want it spicy ask them to make it extra hot."}
{"text":"I've been going here for as long as I can remember. It was almost a special treat to go for a little more higher end Asian cuisine. Not anymore. I'm just disappointed.   I went here for lunch the other day and sit down as I wait for my appointment to show up. I look at the menu (see pic) and it is trashed. I mean what restaurant with white table cloths gives a hand written menu on the left, stains everywhere, and looks like it hasn't been updated in forever. I mean is it that expensive to have decent menus printed out? Paper and ink, come on guys!  The food was mediocre and not like it used to be. I had the crab puffs as an appetizer and they were ok. A little undercooked and doughy texture. I don't want them super crispy either but it just didn't seem done right.   I had the Mongolian beef to keep it standard. And that's what it tasted like just standard. Nothing special. Nothing amazing. The lunch came with soup and got hot and sour. I enjoyed it.   I'm debating on coming back because the service is bland the food is ok and I just think the attention to details have gone to the way side which always makes me think if sanitary issues are ever an issue. If you can't get a clean menu down then what else is happening. Maybe another visit will change my mind."}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese restaurant.  Visiting Scottsdale and was recommended, did not disappoint.  Friendly wait staff, wonderful suggestions and the food was amazing.  Great choice!"}
{"text":"Terribly Americanized but not horrible.  Cute hostesses.  Pricing on the high side.  Would return if dying for Chinese food and unwilling to drive further but otherwise no.  Would rather go to n√©e house."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants. The lunch special is awesome. The Orange chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately and I don't understand why but this place is definitely going down hill.The take out food is really bad, and the so called help leaves  alot to be desired.  Devon you should be ashamed"}
{"text":"Jade Palace has always been my pick for Chinese cuisine. It is always consistantly delish. I tend to place orders for delivery and from the second they answer the phone with a smile (I hear it through the phone) and take my order. It always comes when they say it will and its always hot and fresh. The delivery man is also great. Always says hi to the dogs and always seems happy to be working. Its a refreshing thing to know that some people do take pride in their work.  I would recommend Jade Palace to anyone who wants great food and great service."}
{"text":"This is a nice Chinese restaurant in terms of decor and style. I don't typically see Chinese restaurants like this around here and it's a nice change. Beautiful wallpaper, nice linen tables, plenty of tables and booths all with a casual atmosphere: 5 stars for atmosphere.   However, the food is just okay and the service is nothing great. I ordered the New York eggroll and General Tso's chicken--pretty standard fare. The eggroll was fine but the chicken tasted like boneless wings in a Tso's sauce. It tasted cheap.   The owner greeted us when we walked in and I commented how beautiful the place was, she asked me if it was our first time in and I said yes. You'd think this would mean they'd go out of their way to make sure our meal went well but nope, in fact I struggled to find reason to leave a standard tip (I did though, I always feel guilty if I don't).   I was there for about an hour an never got a refill on my soft drink. Our original server came by once to take our order and after that it was 3-4 different people topping off my boyfriend's iced tea or dropping off dishes. I was going to ask but the servers disappeared super fast.   The menu is general fare and I will probably go here again but won't get the General Tso's chicken. Certainly didn't live up to its Yelp! reputation. Maybe next time will be better.   I still prefer New China Gate in South Scottsdale but it's far drive form where I live now."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Chinese. It's not terrible and it's not bad, but you will get Snobbsdale prices. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff do a fairly good job. I do agree with other reviews that as time has gone on the quality of the food there has degraded. This used to be one of my favorites when it first opened, but now it's just not a bad place. Give it a try if you're curious."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein Lunch Special recently.  Since I got it \"To Go\", I didn't see what I had received until I opened it at home.  I was actually shocked to find what looked like \"Chicken Soup!\"...  There were only a few tasteless flat pieces of Chicken in a thick clear sauce with noodles- again, more like bad soup than \"Chow Mein!\".  I wish I had driven back there to show the Manager the evidence, but unfortunately I was too busy- had a few bites and threw it away.  I actually want to dine in here sometime with a friend to see if what I experiences was a fluke, or if it really is that terrible.  Patrons be warned!"}
{"text":"Group of 4 ... lite eaters this time around so ordered three entrees and fried rice.  General Tso's chicken, very good.  Pepper Beef - different than I expected  - much more sauce but good flavors, but lots of veggies which is good.  Kung Pao chicken was very good - lots of veggies and the chicken tastes fresh and tender.  Great.  Loved the fried rice, though I thought it was a bit understated - perhaps thats my typical expectation to \"american\" Chinese food.  My only complaint is the prices seem a bit high ... $4.50 for soup for one, almost 5 dollars for an egg roll, and most entrees approach $20/plate.   Nice ambiance, but you pay for it.  Service was great.  No left overs though ... so portions tend to be smaller than I typically find.    If the price is ok for you, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"First time here. Came with my wife for late lunch. The place is very close to where we live. The food was excellent for American style Chinese food.  The crispy wonton they serve as a free appetizer is amazing.   I had the twice cooked pork which was very different from what I am used to. The pork was very thickly Sliced. I prefer the traditional thinly Sliced pork version of this dish. My wife had the fried rice which was very good. Overall for American style Chinese it us great."}
{"text":"Just go here and enjoy! Remember to share, portions are large, and you want to try as much as you can...Lettuce wraps, egg rolls, spring rolls get them all! We did seafood for an entree. This is NOT your typical Chinese take out AT ALL. They make everything fresh, DE-LISH!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for Chinese food and Jade Palace was in front of me.  We ordered the Hunan Beef & Mixed Veggies with Shrimp. The food came out in less 5 minutes from when we ordered.  It was warm but tasted good for what I expected.  The veggie dish was also warm and taste ok like one would expect from a Chinese resturant.  The staff was very friendly, but never refilled our water.  So overall good, but I would expect more for a nicely decorated place and the $14.95 per dished."}
{"text":"Jade Palace is our favorite Arizona Chinese restaurant. We are always warmly greeted by the owner, manager and staff. The menu is varied and innovative. Selections include scallops, sea bass, pork, beef, chicken , shrimp and vegetarian dishes. We have never been disappointed and look forward to dining here often. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh. Not my favorite chinese place in the world. Restaurant is a little nicer than it looks like from the outside, but the decor was a bit kitschy for me. Started with some crab puffs that were excellent, maybe the best I've had. Also the orange sauce that comes with the wontons was amazing.   We ordered the orange chicken and chow fun noodles with beef. Orange chicken was ok, the chow fun was incredibly salty and the beef lacked any flavor at all. And to top it off, my wife's fortune cookie didn't have a fortune inside it :)  We probably won't go back. It's just good, not great."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Sleep Inn and looking for Chinese delivery spot that was not Chinese fast food. I ordered steamed dumplings and General Tso's Chicken.   I have to say I was so impressed with how good the food was, it was so delicious. It reminded of the Chinese Food when I lived in New York."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places in area. The best ribs of any I've tried made New York style. No other place makes them this way. All of their dishes are a step above others including the \"authentic\" ones. Service is the best I've found and the elegance and location makes for a great experience. I have eaten in many places in Hong Kong and the food is no better. The prices are higher of course being in Scottsdale but that should be expected. I tried their dim sum on Sunday and some were perfect while others need some work but this is a first attempt and I'm hopeful because there are very few dim sum places in the Phoenix area. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place was in a cute little shopping strip in the corner next to TCBY, which was hard to find at first, but I was surprised at how nice it was inside. I think it's a little more \"Americanized\" in the sense that there were not a whole lot of asian workers there. Their service was really good, the host guy spoke really soothingly like I was in a spa when he took my order (to go)  I had read they had great lunch specials so I got the shrimp with vegetables, which came with fried rice, crab puff, egg roll, and wonton chips. Wasn't a fan of the spicy mustard dipping sauce, but they gave two types of sweet and sour sauce and I liked those. I also got the wonton soup (shrimp and chicken with veggies), shrimp chow fun, and a small order of the flash fried green beans. I liked that they used big shrimp and that I didn't get a stomach ache, which can happen when I eat chinese a lot of times.   I think I'll be back to try some more of the lunch specials and I kind of want to try the sea bass if I feel like splurging! Oh, because I ordered so much food, the guy thought that it was for 3 people and said he put in three sets of utensils for me. I just eat a lot and like leftovers, but he was too nice for me to correct =P"}
{"text":"Finally, New York Style Chinese food!!!  Being from NY I had a problem finding a Chinese restaurant like the great food I enjoyed back East.  Well, I was so happy to find the Jade Palace, I used to go to the one on Hayden but it closed but was happy to find this location on Shea - the atmosphere here is so much nicer.  The food is unreal,  we had the New York eggrolls (of course) I was blown away and taken right back to Manhattan in an instant, generously filled and crispy as they should be unlike many AZ restaurants I've tried that try to pass of f a spring roll as an eggroll (what is up with that?) LOL anyway, VERY YUMMY!   Also had the chicken and brocooli, sweet and sour chicken as well as spicy chinese eggplant - everything my family ordered was great, so much food we all ended up sharing and having food to take home - I can't wait to go back to this place - it's worth the drive from Gilbert to go to for dinner - I have a feeling everything on that menu is great but no matter when I go I plan to order more NY eggrolls - thank you Jade Palace!"}
{"text":"For some reason this place has their Best Of reviews on plaques by the door. I've been here a couple of times at the behest of friends and both times, it's been miserable. Last time, we were a table of 10 so I forgive a lot if they are not specialists in larger parties. I was there with a friend and we were shown to the last booth in the back at 530P on a Wednesday. Our server was a middle aged gentleman and far from friendly. No attempt at upsell with cocktails or apps. I asked why they designate their egg rolls as NY egg rolls. Answer: because they have pork. WTF?  The 4 top of senior citizens next to us got the fried wontons and sauces as a complimentary app, we did not.  We did not get water refills and I had to ask to have hot tea refilled (which they charge for the initial fill).  Serving dishes come out warm and they offer only cold plates. Our food was cold within 5 minutes. Enter a table of 6 Asian people (3 children) and they are provided chopsticks and attentive service. It was assumed by our rude waiter that we were not adept at handling chopsticks and weren't offered any.  For two people, we ordered 4 dishes, not apps so any waiter would assume the tip would be decent. The  \"best of Phoenix\" lo mein is greasy. The spring rolls are passable. I didn't even want to try the mixed veg plate as it was swimming in oil. Fried rice was ok, very very bland.  Our waiter was so surly it was ridiculous even trying to get the bill. I am so annoyed my friend picked up the bill when the food was cold, and she tipped the server when  it was an exercise to get any service and we didn't get the same service afforded to others.    This place is terrible. Anyone who awarded this  'New York Style Chinese Cuisine\" or \"Best Lo Mein in Phoenix' should have their palate cleansed and tested before returning to work.  Overpriced. Greasy. Poor service. Rude."}
{"text":"We love Jade! It's an amazing place for a special dinner or date night with spouse and friends. We have consistently always had a nice evening here."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food. I wouldn't know it from cold, boiled weasel. But here's what I do know. The slop they serve up as Asian at most chains is about as authentic as Sasha Grey's onscreen orgasms. (Unless we're talkin Slut Puppies 2, her crowning glory). Not Jade.  Jade serves up food that's on par (or at least close) with The Empress of China, one of my favorite San Francisco haunts. That's why Jade is on my bi-monthly rotation during season, switching to weekly when the snowbirds have gone back to where-the-fuck-ever.  Last night was yet another great experience. Fast friendly service, great tasting food, and well-prepared cocktails. We even got to visit with the owner, who was auspiciously holding court as he lit from table to table...his upbeat demeanor forcing smiles from even the most curmudgeonly of patrons.  My go-to dish is the House Special Egg Foo Yung which is served with a medium-sized ramekin of brown gravy. A must for any aspiring redneck / gravy aficionado. It's twelve bucks and worth every cent.  IMPORTANT WARNING: If you're Italian with a federal RICO warrant for your arrest, or, like to pay with counterfeit money, stay the hell away from here.  The owner explained how in his eighteen years in the business, he got his first fake twenties recently which means the FBI is probably now watching the place. Isn't that special."}
{"text":"A little greasy for me, I like my Chinese a little leaner.  But they do have an option to get your meal steamed with the sauce on the side, so next time, that's what I'll order.  Quality and quantity was good though and the service at the bar was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with friends. Chinese cook was on vacation to China so no dim sum. Bummer. Well, we chose a couple of entrees, orange chicken was very good, not soggy like some places but almost crispy. Very good. Sea bass was very tender. Liked the 4 seasons. Noodles were excellent.  Pretty much everything we tried was very good. Not sure about the price but seemed reasonable, especially considering the quality. Service was attentive without being over bearing. Very nice decor.   Would recommend. Want to go back on a Sunday when the cook is back to try the dim sum."}
{"text":"What a phenomenal dining experience. Everything from the atmosphere to the wait staff things could not have been more perfect. Haven't had such a bid Chinese meal since I left New York City. Everything from the crispy Noodles & Duck Sauce to the pepper steak and the fried rice."}
{"text":"Just an FYI that they have moved locations to the plaza on the North East corner of Pima and Pinnicle Peak Rd. Same staff, same menu and same amazing service."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to this restaurant and I really like the. The service was excellent, the restaurant has always been clean and the Kung Pao Chicken was delicious. I'm hooked and I highly recommend it. It is very nice inside, a good place to take a date..."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food in a nice atmosphere. Ate there with friends celebrating a birthday. Everything was fresh and well-seasoned. Had Peking duck wrapped in lettuce for appetizer that was a special and very good. All dishes were beautifully presented. Just all around excellent and not very pricey. At end they presented all of us with blood orang sorbet for my friend's birthday. Staff was friendly and conscientious. Worth a trip if in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I am visiting the Scottsdale area on vacation.  I drove by this restaurant while on the way to another restaurant.  I looked it up on my iPhone Yelp application and decided to stop in.  We ordered four different main dishes, and soup, and appetizers.  They were all great.  It is really great, food, atmosphere, and service.  The restaurant was also exceptionally clean.  I am going to do a return visit with the family tonight.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for takeout today. The Kung Pao chicken ($16) Btw was in a word, terrible . No veggies , just chicken and peanuts and very little spice .  Skip this place in my opinion, they are stealing"}
{"text":"I had a really good dining experience at Jade Palace.  We had reservations, so I think it helped with being seated without problems.  The meal was great and the service was wonderful and very professional."}
{"text":"Been searching for a Chinese restaurant in the area, so we tried this since it got good reviews. It was just okay, nothing special. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I expect of Chinese Food. It felt like it was trying too hard to be a \"fancy\" restaurant and failing. The food didn't taste bad it was just boring and very Americanism. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and specifically asked them to make it very spicy and it was still very mild, Panda Express kung pao is spicier. Also no chopsticks which I thought was super weird. I haven't decided if I'd go back, I guess it depends if I can find another Chinese place around, I will try others first."}
{"text":"I eat here a fair amount. Usually the food is pretty good, not great. But I strayed from my normal shrimp w lobster sauce or double dragon and ordered the filet and jumbo shrimp. Big mistake. There is no way that is filet mignon. It was cooked as ordered, medium, but it was a crazy chewy steak. I had to saw through it and then chew through it. I eat lots of filet . This is not filet! Round steak or some other cheap cut of meat. Stay away from this dish."}
{"text":"We were looking to just grab some Chinese on our way home after a long day. We ordered carry out from Jade Palace because it was convenient. I was blown away by how good it was. The crab puff actually had crab in them- not just a blob of cream cheese. The orange chicken was amazing. Again- it actually tasted like chicken with a great glaze- not just a bunch of coating. Jade Palace is best Chinese I've had in town!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. All I can say is wow. We had a reservation but arrived early and decided to have drinks at the bar, was so much fun we had dinner there as well. A beautiful space here! The bartender, Emily, is great. Be warned, Jade Palace is pretty proud of their cocktails (read expensive) and they should be. Generous and hand crafted. The service in the bar for drinks and dinner was excellent. We had won ton soup for two to start. Best I have ever had anywhere! If winter keeps going I may stop in just for the soup!! Then we had the shrimp and veggies and a filet with shrimp. Simply amazing. I cannot wait to go back. Cant say enough about this place! Be warned, this place gets very busy regularly, when there is a local concert look out! Hope you enjoy as much as we did!"}
{"text":"If location were the only criteria, Jade Palace would get 10 stars.  Conveniently located next to Sweet Republic, Jade Palace offers the perfect opportunity to suggest Chinese for dinner, knowing you'll end up with heaven for dessert.  Probably 3.5 stars, but feeling generous today.  I'm pretty sure this is why my husband suggested it.  But I had wanted to try it as well, and I'm glad we did.  Nicer inside than your average strip mall restaurant, I was surprised by the space.  Nothing too modern or contemporary here, but white tablecloths and candles on the table make for a nice atmosphere.  Our service was excellent as well.  We started with crab puffs and BBQ ribs.  The crab puffs were a pleasant surprise in that you could actually taste...get ready for this...crab.  In contrast to the typical cream cheese with flecks of pink you usually get, which I confess to love.  The BBQ ribs were way too fatty  with very little meat.    I always go with the safe dishes and ordered lemon chicken.  I was expecting the usual chopped up chicken, dredged in batter, and swimming in sauce.  What I got was the actual chicken breast, sliced, with a delicate lemon sauce spooned over the top.    My husband ordered the crispy roast duck, bone in.  I didn't try it, but I could see that it was, indeed, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  He must have liked it because he ate no rice at all, and he loves rice, usually eats a pile of it.  I'll let some of our Yelper's with more sophisticated palates argue that Jade is Americanized Chinese food.  For me, I'm a fan and will return next time I need a Sweet Republic fix."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. Period. What you're paying for and seeing people give it high ratings for--plain and simple--is the decor, the cloth napkins and tablecloths, and the massive staff that keeps your water full, your table bussed, and your meal served. But as much as I hate to say it, the food is really just average and beyond overpriced for what you get, and isn't even close to the food at your average PF Chang's."}
{"text":"I'm a Scottsdale local who loves Asian food, and Jade Palace is the BEST!!! Authentic Chinese recipes, with the freshest ingredients, and always 5-Star service:) Try it! They're on Pima, just south of Troon North, oh and on Sundays you can watch the Cardinals play, on their big screens, at the super posh bar!"}
{"text":"The comments on the age of the clientele may be on the money. After all, my parents love to eat here and mom uses a walker now, and hers was not the only walker in the dining room  I've been coming to this place with them since I was in high school, and I graduated over 25 years ago, so that will give you an idea of how long this place has been around. The food on my last visit was not up to snuff. Every dish we ordered came out cold and the lo mein was overly greasy.  Yes, it's Americanized and you have to ask for chopsticks. You're in Scottsdale. Consider who lives around here. They're cooking for the neighborhood. Jade Palace is comfort food. You're not going to reach culinary heights, but you'll get dishes you know and love.  I just wish they didn't let them sit at the pass so long that they all came out cold."}
{"text":"first time visitor, first 2 meals were wrong order, then couple who came in after me gets served before I do.   Will NEVER go back to this place. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Our experience here was definitely 5 star. We had the wor wonton soup and the scallops in black pepper sauce. Both dishes were fresh and flavorful. Still crisp vegetables and the dishes were honestly cooked to perfection. The service and atmosphere were perfect."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Their food is wonderful and authentic and they deliver very quickly. I highly recommend Jade's Palace!"}
{"text":"Been to Jade multiple times. If you're going for dinner, make a reservation or be prepared to wait. You can get a drink while you wait but the seating at the bar is almost always full so you'll be drinking while standing. The food and service is average but given the other options in the area for similar food, its the best one. We tend to eat on the healthier side so we are extremely limited in what we can order as those options are few and far between. I'm sure we'll be back, but there are plenty of other places with in Scottsdale where you can get the same average Chinese food."}
{"text":"Having been a loyal customer for several years I had to write about a particularly terrible experience we had on Christmas day. We contacted the restaurant at 2:30 to place an order for pick-up at 5:30. We were told to call back 45 minutes before we wanted to pick it up. When we tried to call we got a consistent busy signal. Finally we sent my daughter in to order and discovered that they turned off their phones without even giving a message for customers to come in. She paid for the order and was told it would be ready in 1 1/2 hours and we would get a call. The restaurant never called and after 2 hours we went in and were told it would be another 45 minutes. Yes it was Christmas day but this experience was pathetic and judging by the other customers reactions we were not the only ones to have to deal with this. There are other excellent Chinese restaurants and they will now get our business."}
{"text":"The menu was FULL of great choices, we settled on the war wonton soup (soggy noodles, VERY overcooked shrimp, sickly sweet broth), teriyaki chicken (bland, fatty & more skin than chicken), yang chow fried rice (greasy, very poor cuts of chicken & pork), and chicken fried rice (again, greasy and with lots of fatty chicken). The service wasn't very good and the pricing was more appropriate for a MUCH better meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and broccoli lunch special and got the wonton soup. The size of the serving was very big and I actually left the restaurant really full, but not stuffed.  The restaurant was clean and the service was good, so I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Jade Palace rules. Two coworkers and I discovered this location purely by accident as we drove to Chipotle, and decided to eat here instead. The soup was good. The entrees were good. The restaurant was clean, and busy with area worker-bees. The cost was less than 8 bucks per person. How the hell did we miss this place for so long?"}
{"text":"I love this place! We went here for Christmas dinner 2012  and my dad's birthday (Aug. 3). There is usually a wait so get there early. It is a nice Chinese restaurant and their Cashew Chicken is where it's at! Definitely give Jade Palace a visit!"}
{"text":"Today was my 2nd trip to Jade Place.. and my last trip. Another Scottsdale flop with over hyped reviews and lack luster food. Today was the last straw.. spareribs burnt black.. chewy beef.. zero flavor to anything. Ignore the reviews and avoid the Jade Palace. Everyone says it is the best Chinese place around... unfortunately they may be right. The reviews are insane for this place I have no idea where they are eating.."}
{"text":"This place is just an average classic American Chinese restaurant. The service is great and friendly and the hostesses upon coming in were friendly, sweet and genuine. The three stars is for the food. It is average. I ordered pan fried pot stickers and they came cool to touch and barely toasted. Super disappointed. I will have to say though that when it came to the main courses orange chicken and the fried rice that was amazing. If you are ordering the American basics (which I usually don't but was in an interesting mood) you will be pleasantly surprised. I would like to give this place a 4 star rating, but with that appetizer...not going to happen."}
{"text":"Jade Palace of Scottsdale is my favorite Chinese restaurant west of the Mississippi!!! Growing up in Detroit, I was use to great Chinese food but after moving to Louisiana, Texas and then Arizona, I began to wonder if I would ever find great food again. Then I found Jade Palace. Their food is always excellent and so is their service. Prices are very reasonable for the quality you get. You can't beat their NEW YORK EGG ROLLS, IMPERIAL DUCK, EGG FOO YOUNG and HOUSE FRIED RICE. And then top that off with an ALMOND COOKIE (not the fortune cookie). Five stars does not do this restaurant justice."}
{"text":"Orange chicken so good, it makes you want to shoot a panda...  Introducing new favorite Chinese place in my new hometown of Scottsdale: JADE PALACE. I'm from SoCal originally and have had some of the best Chinese food in Alhambra, Monterey Park, LA's Chinatown, etc and this place rivals them all.   I was truly shocked at how perfectly cooked my prawns were in the shrimp in black bean sauce. You could taste the freshness and the sauce was delicate with the perfect amount of pungency from the black beans.  The New York egg roll was crunchy, delicious and on point. Not to mention the excellent duck sauce and delicious hot mustard they made to accompany it.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and never intrusive and was helpful with discussing menu options.   Truly, a delightful place. It's not cheap, but the quality is there. It reminds me of my favorite Chinese place ever, Spring Garden in Pasadena, CA (which has been closed for a few years now RIP). I'm thankful to have found Jade Palace, and look forward to coming here for many years to come."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have found this place. The food is awesome and the service is great. I am very particular about how Chinese food is prepared and they nailed it. Great job guys. We will be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. I mean very slow and there were not many customers in restaurant. Hubby said he wouldn't return. BUT THEN THEY SERVED THE FOOD. IT WAS AMAZING.  Nice presentation, nice portions and wonderful food. Solution?????  Order a bottle of wine, relax and just wait it out. It's worth it. Hubby agrees."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Shea location and it was pretty good, so when returning from a day trip to the south, it seemed like a good idea to exit the 101 and cruise up Pima and pick up Chinese for dinner at the new Pinnacle Peak restaurant.  Not so much.  If it wasn't for some decent hot and sour soup, this would be a 0-1 star rating.  First of all, outrageously priced.  We got one serving of the aforementioned hot and sour soup, a pork lo-mein, and a chicken kung pao.  It was $36.00.  Which we would have bravely swallowed, if the food had been decent.  First---as I said, the hot and sour soup was okay.  Not as good as Dao's, which has set the bar on hot and sour soup in my opinion.  But it was okay.    Pork Lo-Mein.  Omg...really?  The noodles were undercooked, the sauce was tasteless, and it had---I counted, four strips of pork.  I even checked the receipt to see if I had received vegetarian by accident and those pork bits were incidental, but no---it said pork lo-mein.  And it couldn't be vegetarian anyways because there were literally six long green strands of green onions tops and that was it.  Then the tasteless sauce and the chewy-nearly-crunchy-noodles.  DH laughs because I will eat about anything, even while I am complaining, but I just ended up shoving 90% of this into the garbage in disgust.  DH ordered the Kung Pao chicken and asked for it to be spicy.  A slight modification but it seemed to baffle the young lady who took the phone order.  (But I have noticed these kids are not really adaptable these days!)  It took her a minute to get it entered.  So anyhow, DH was no more happy with his meal than I with mine.  One---just one---of those skinny red peppers had been tossed in for the spice, and as DH said, TG for that, because otherwise the whole entree would have been deadly bland.  He just nibbled on the pepper for a couple of bites.  Only a couple of bites, because the two pieces of chicken that were the protein part of the meal were---in his words---\"slimy, leftover chicken you forget at the back of the fridge\" and so gristle-y that he actually spit back out on the edge of his plate most of what he ate.  (Eww.  That was pleasant to witness.)  What it had in plenty was sliced water chestnuts.  It looked like they had poured the entire can in.  We ended up tossing his entree too and made chocolate chip cookies.  So much for a nutritious dinner---but they were tasty!  Maybe we just hit them on a bad night, but it was nearly $40 of bad, so we won't be running back down there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered from here because of the reviews. I can not believe how disappointing the food was. Its the next day and I'm still upset about it. I think what makes it even worse is the price. Their price point is insanely expensive for the quality. The food was beyond bland, I tossed all $65 of it in the trash.  I'm literally at a loss of words. I should have just went with my first instinct and went to Pei Wei but I like to support small business. This place literally left the worst taste in my mouth. I wish they put as much effort into their food as they do their storefront. The storefront explains the overpriced, horrible food. I feel totally cheated after ordering here . I was better off just burning my money. This makes me rethink yelp reviews. They must have a paid subscription that keeps all the good reviews at the top. There has to be an explanation! How?!! How is this place getting 4 stars based on food!??!! Thai Patio is 100 times better than this place, too bad you have to go all the way to Mesa."}
{"text":"I have been to over 3 dozen Chinese restaurants in Phoenix area, this is by far the best.  On par with some of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in NY and SF.  Reasonably priced, the food is first rate.  The service is wonderful, with the owner usually on site to add a personal touch to each and every table's meal.  The interior is nicely set up as well.  The only down side is it's location in a strip mall."}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant.  First, I had left a message early in the morning on the 24th of December.  The owner called me from his mobile to try to work out a table even though the restaurant was fully booked.  The atmosphere is more upscale and fun with great waiters, a bar scene and a clientele out to have a good time.  While the food is pretty much what you get at any Chinese restaurant, the ingredients were better and the preparation more fresh and light.  They have a nice and moderately priced wine list.  My complaint with most Chinese restaurants is that they lack the vibe I want when out for dinner--no vibe lunch is fine.  Here I get delicious Chinese food with that evening out atmosphere I want."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials and great ambiance. My husband and I dined here after an appointment near by and we were pleasantly surprised! Good size portions, amazing service, and tasty Chinese food. We had the general tso's chicken, shrimp with black bean sauce, egg drop soup, fried rice and spring rolls. We will be coming back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"I finally found egg drop soup in Scottsdale that I love!  Everything I had was great, the soup, the New York style egg roll (I was stuffed after that and the soup!) and the cashew chicken.  I'm looking forward to lunch so I can eat my leftovers!"}
{"text":"I have been a carry out customer of Jade Palace for at least 2 years.  The food is good as long as you enjoy Americanized Chinese.  My only beef with these guys is their hubris. Just because you do a lot of business and are always busy does NOT in any way give you license to be customer unfriendly. The last 2 visits have been somewhat unpleasant. Could it be the Trump affect. Well guys, revel in your celebrity for as long as it lasts. Keep serving Americanized Chinese food to the geriatric North Scottsdale crowd. Sooner or later you will be replaced by a better marketplace competitor.   Today was the all time low for this place. I sat at the bar and experienced somewhat of an extraordinary delay in getting someone to wait on me. But no worries.  The coup de grace was when I asked the bartender what their best Szechuan dish was. She very admirably told me that she would ask the manager to come and talk to me. I appreciated that. But then I observed her talking to the manager who did not want to talk to me. So sheepishly she came back to me with, what I considered, a lame reply.  But then when my dinner arrived it was not what I had ordered. But that did not faze these guys. They just took it away and many minutes later returned with what I had actually ordered. No apologies, no regrets.  YOU GUYS SUCK!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a great place for Chinese food. Now service is terrible, food just ok. Brought guest from out of town there and was rushed thru our food because the table was  needed  for a reservation that evening. please don't eat there save your money and eat in any other restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered their enormous NY egg rolls with cabbage, meat, and shrimp. Terrific.  Egg drop soup was decent, but somewhat bland even for egg drop soup.  Szechuan Chicken was terrific with fresh vegetables and no onions with a snap of spice at the end. I'll order it more spicy next time.  Chicken fried rice had a great soft texture with a decent amount of chicken, but heavy-handed onions dominated the dish. The real disappointment was the scallops and beef dish. The quality of the beef was between low end and adequate ... A real negative experience. You could taste the excess oil in the dish ... Not good enough.  The restaurant can do better.   If I had ordered only the egg roll, chicken, and soup ... It would have been 3-4 stars."}
{"text":"This place has been around at least as long as I lived in Arizona but never had a chance to try until the other day.  Why did I wait over 10 years?  Nice upscale ambiance. I like all the decor they had. We went without reservation thinking who would eat Chinese food on Christmas Eve? I was wrong. I was told to wait 20-30 mins.  Fortunately wait wasn't too long and we were seated at nice comfy booth.  Service was good. We waited for our food a bit longer than we are used to at any other Chinese restaurants but this place was busy.  Food was very good. Orange crispy chicken was spicy and good. Fried tofu with brown sauce became really good after I added some hot oil.  There are many more items on the menu I wanted to try, so I will be back soon. Next time I won't wait 10+ years."}
{"text":"This spot is really pleasant, nice upscale family atmosphere. It's very well run and cared for, management is caring and polite. There is a really nice quality to the ambiance overall.  Food is probably better than the choices we made. War of wanton soup was delish. Sheschuan  chicken is not tasty, bland, throw away bell peppers, small portion.  Then there is this shrimp dish in \"Grand Marnier\" sauce, although the shrimp itself was yummy and well cooked, it was smothered in a white mayonnaisy kind if sauce which was NOT appetizing and nothing like Grand Marnier, and made it very hard to enjoy if eatable. Came also w some throw away broccoli.  I wouldnt order these two entrees again, but will be back to try a couple of other things before making a final verdict, as i am hoping it was just a miss and we will have a hit the second time around."}
{"text":"Been meaning to do a review for a long time as I have been eating here for years. Food is consistently great. Probably have to say it's the best Chinese food in AZ that I know of.  Can't go wrong with cashew chicken and the wife loves the vegetable fried rice. Sweet and Pungent Shrimp is also great  Only caution would be to check carry out orders because they are occasionally wrong."}
{"text":"American style Chinese with a fancy schmancy vibe.  The waiters and guy up front certainly want you to feel like you are in a high class joint.  Beef and broccoli made with filet mignon?  I don't know if they have it, but I wouldn't be surprised.  I basically had Kung pao with flank steak, shrimp and big scallops subbed for the standard chicken.  The steak was tender and the seafood of quality size and texture - it was certainly a tasty dish.  We also had imperial duck, which was also quite good.  Given the upgraded ingredients, you can expect to pay a premium.  But you know what?  It still kinda just tastes like you're eating Chinese - go fig.    I probably woulda rounded up from 3.5 to 4, except I'm still kinda obsessing a bit - WHAT DID SHE DO WITH MY HOT AND SOUR SOUP???  Seriously - we had at least three bowls as leftovers, and this lady comes by and asks if she can box it up.  Sure!  She comes back three minutes later with maybe a small ladle of it in a Tupperware, barely half what was there before.  Did she spill it?  Pour it down the sink?  Serve it to someone else?  I don't think we'll ever know.  Watch your soup folks - don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"I am from New York so I am use to great Chinese food. Jade place is fantastic just like New York Chinese food. Chicken and cashew nuts is a great dish also egg rolls are amazing. Staff is friendly I highly recommend jade palace."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is the Arizona answer to Chinese food, but the food was blah.  First, there were more garnishes than actual dish. Lots of water chestnuts, but not so much shrimp. Lots of peanuts, but very little mongolian beef. The brown rice was so hard, it was almost as if it was half-cooked. The chow fun was bland and uninspired. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We have never had a bad meal here.  I have enjoyed the lunch specials here, come here with my husband on Date Night, brought the entire family for dinner, and we also order take-out frequently.  Needless to say, we are big fans!  My husband loves the Hot and Sour Soup here ~ he can finish a large order by himself.  My kids always get the wonton soup and I am partial to the egg drop soup. Yum.  They always serve (or include a package for carryout) the crispy wonton strips and they are very generous with them.  My favorite meal here is the shrimp with lobster sauce.  The order always comes with so many, plump flavorful shrimp and the sauce is lip-smacking good.  Pair it with an order of Yang Chow fried rice. Seriously delicious.  We also order the Mongolian beef, Teriyaki Chicken, and General Tso's.  It is a restaurant that my family always looks forward to going to.  The people there are so nice and friendlly and we never feel rushed.  We have been there when every table has been filled, and still the service is wonderful.  We have enjoyed the lovely music from the harpist many times while dining.  Wonderful place."}
{"text":"This is mediocre and overpriced! Have tried several dishes and only the spareribs are worth mentioning . Save your time and money , go to Flos"}
{"text":"The interior looks great, cozy. The restaurant has the best authentic roast crispy duck that I have eaten since I came to America. The meat was so juicy, the skin is thin and crispy. I call crispy duck every single time I go to Chinese restaurants (if they have it), so I think my judge is pretty accurate. Try it one time, that how it's supposed to taste like in Asia"}
{"text":"Okay - so here's the skinny - the place looks questionable from the outside, but on the inside decor is tasteful enough to take someone out for a nice meal. While this is closer to the real asian dishes, it definitely still fell short of great chinese restaurants in SF. While the schezuan chicken lunch special seemed to be a popular choice for my compatriates, I thought it just passed mustard. Good, but not fabulous.  As for me, I've tried the Chilean Sea Bass and all I thought was it was just salty and the sauce was not appopriate for such a delicate fish. If you're ever in SF, swing by Osha Thai and try their Chilean Sea Bass - it's a great example how the fish should be served up.  However, comparably speaking, it's probably one of the better chinese restaurants in the area. Good luck with it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and Jade Palace does not disappoint.  I love the egg drop soup and those crispy won ton chip things that they give you.  It is kind of pricey but it's not that bad and my boyfriend and I normally share soup and one entree anyway so it evens out.  For entrees, I recommend the #8 house special (filet mignon and prawns) because it's delicious and even though it doesn't seem like a lot of food when it comes out, it is filling.  We enjoy this place more than some hole in the wall Chinese restaurants we've been too and we typically love hole in the wall restaurants better so that says a lot about this place!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this restaurant upon entering the building.  It was a very nice and comfortable environment.  However the dining area we were sitting in must had horrible acoustics as there was one other family in the room who was incredibly loud I couldn't hear the person sitting across from me.  This did seem somewhat of an unusual event however as even the restaurant staff seemed happy to see them go.  As for our meal, the flavor was perfect.  I thought that our two dishes had great taste and tender meats.  I also always do like enough sauce with our dishes so you can have some on your rice and its not dry and they did an excellent job.  However our food was basically room temperature.  After notifying the server who took it back to the kitchen to be reheated they brought it back and it was still tepid at best.  My other complaint would be that the portion size was smaller in my opinion, and the price was a little steep in comparison."}
{"text":"so sad. friends had told us not to go to this Jade Palace as it was very inferior to its sister location on Shea blvd. they were so right. Service is terrible. 25% full and yet we sat forever before we could order. Egg rolls came out cold and we were told it is because they are frozen. not to bright. took another 15 minutes to get hot egg rolls then another 20 minutes to get our entrees.The servers were more interested in talking to each other rather then serve the customers.the shea location is everything this location is not. great food, service and a very friendly staff. so sad."}
{"text":"I can't think of worse Chinese food I've had. Soggy frozen chicken, soggy pan \"fried\" dumplings, gritty hot & sour soup, and they would not even entertain charging me extra to upgrade to fried rice or lo mein... but for some reason gave me a PINT of extra general tsao sauce? Took a chance and regret it... try another place."}
{"text":"Jade Palace is a delight. The food quality is exceptional and the service is top notch. The owner Davlen knows his wine and has a great selection of wines in his very large wine cooler. The food is not your typical Chinese restaurant. It is a high end restaurant with very reasonable pricing.  Definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Jade Palace on Pinnacle Peak in North Scottsdale was my \"go-to\" Chinese place for years... so when I moved to Old Town, I felt a bit lost and haven't been able to find consistent Chinese nearby ever since.  I've recently found a few options in Phoenix, but after a recent take-out experience with friends and last night's meal dining in at this JP location, I think I may become a regular!  We met my parents for dinner here, and everyone was pleased with the meal.  Service was spot-on, atmosphere was fine, drinks were cold and refilled often (the beers even came with chilled glasses), and most important, the food was fabulous!  I took charge of the food order for our party of four but allowed everyone to chime in of course.  Here's what we had:  Appetizers:  *1 large order New York Egg Rolls (2 total egg rolls but we had them cut in half so each of us had a half... delicious!) *1 large order BBQ Spare Ribs (8 per order)  Entrees: *Lo Mein Noodles with Shrimp and (extra) Broccoli *Dry Sauteed String Beans (1 small order) *House Specialty #9 (Kung Pao Three Delicacies) - Sea Scallops, Jumbo Prawns, and sliced Flank Steak in Kung Pao Sauce *Mu Shu Chicken   Of course, this was all served with plenty of white rice as well.  We ate almost everything, and the only negative I can say is that unfortunately, we didn't have leftovers to take home!    Another perk for this location? Sweet Republic is in the same shopping center, so if you save room, head over there for dessert!"}
{"text":"Located in the Safeway shopping center on the northeast corner of Scottsdale & Pinnacle Peak, this Jade Palace may seem far for some of you, but for some of us living in North Phoenix / Scottsdale, it's the best Chinese around!  Jade Palace is a regular in my rotation of consistent dine-in and take-out restaurants and has been for years.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the service is attentive.  The hostesses are always sweet and if you place a take-out order, they make sure that they read your order back to you to avoid any confusion.  My favorite dishes are the healthy choice steamed shrimp (or chicken) and veggies, mu shu chicken, and dry sauteed string bean.  Their soups are all really good as well.  The saying 'never order fish in a Chinese Restaurant' does not hold true at Jade Palace - go for it... it's delicious!  Devlan, the Manager & Co-owner, can often be found at this location and he is extremely personable and makes sure that all of his customers have a pleasant experience... Whether I'm coming from the gym in workout clothes or I'm dressed from work, dining solo or with a group, I always feel welcome at Jade Palace.  For the food and the service, this is a fantastic restaurant.  If you like Chinese food, check out Jade Palace - I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"Just ok, very americanized fair, not that good but close to home and do like the eggrolls - find it a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!   The food was poor quality and fair at best! Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food.  Not too loud so you can have a conversation,while enjoying the wonderful variety of foods. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Jade Palace Pinnacle Peak is a Masterpiece!  This is the finest Chinese restaurant in all of Arizona and one of the best spots in all of North Scottsdale.  The new location is gorgeous, stylish, elegant, and just plain wonderful.  Jade Palace has been around in the Valley for many years and it continues to improve in every possible way. I have experienced fantastic service and really enjoy so many of the friendly and engaging members of the wait staff.  Whenever possible ask for Karen shes awesome.  I began eating at Jade about 6 years ago and used to frequent the Shea location, until I discovered Devlan, Hugh, and their exceptional staff.  The Mei family is kind, friendly, and all about providing an enjoyable and fun dining experience. This kind of family run, high-end restaurant is seldom seen anymore, especially in Scottsdale.  The 5-Star experience can easily be shared by all with few simple tips...  -Make a reservation.  -Ask for Hugh Mei, he is the general manager and truly the best possible guide for a delish and lovely experience. Hugh will help insure that your service is excellent.  -Try new dishes and be open to suggestions, especially with the wonderful seafood specialties. Jade has some really incredible dishes!  And the best possible suggestion to understand the culture of Jade Palace is to prepare yourself and your party for a true dining experience of 1.5+ hours. They also have a wonderful bar culture of regular patrons who dine at the bar, share stories, and relax over great cocktails/wine, and custom made dishes never found on any menu.  The Mei family loves to eat, drink, and share family time.  This is exactly how they run Jade Palace, as an extension of their friends/family.  The true Chinese experience is had family style, sharing many dishes, pouring wine, enjoying laughter, and savoring each amazing bite and taste.    Jade often gets very busy, especially on the weekends and holidays. So plan accordingly and allow for extra time to sit, enjoy, relax, and have a wonderful experience.  There are so many must, do not miss dishes on the menu so I will share a couple of my faves and then you can explore on your own.  The NY style Egg Rolls are delish, and the BBQ Spare Ribs are Amazeballs!! The Sizzling Rice soup is bomb.com... I am a huge fan of the House Chow Fun. The Seabass is out of this world, and they cook the Filet Mignon to perfection, all of the chicken dishes come out tender and delish. One of my most favorite dishes is the Imperial Duck!!!! It is unreal good, dripping with flavor, crispy on the edges, lean, and yummm-yummm good! My last tip on found is the Green Bean side dish-- just ask for it Hugh style and be prepared to slurp up every single bean on your plate.  Jade's menu always includes seasonal specialties such as Lobster, uniquely prepared vegetables, and often some unreal Roasted Chicken dishes!  Be prepared to spend a few dollars, share lots of great food, and sip on some really great wine.  Oh and the Dirty Blue-Cheese Olive Martini is the best in all of Scottsdale...  In case you can't make it this far North, try the Jade Shea location just off the 101 and Shea.  Truthfully the food may be slightly better by way of the longer seasoned cookware, but by no way much different. The wine won't be nearly as exceptional, but you will enjoy Shea Jade and it's a great place to order Take-Out.  I am a big fan of Jade Palace and you will be as well.  For a quick and delish option-- order Take-Out and pick up your food.  Their take out is awesome and you will have a great time eating their tasty dishes at your own comfy place.  Hopefully I will see you at their bar soon!"}
{"text":"Better than Flo's, PF Chiang's or Pe Wei!!!"}
{"text":"We recently viewed their on line menu to help make our selections then called in a carry out order.  All went well EXCEOT that the actual price of the food was significantly more expensive than the price listed on line. The food was well prepared and ready at the promised time.  Just be ware of the price differential!"}
{"text":"Actually this is a 3 1/4 star, not quite a 4. We went here today for lunch and everything was very tasty. Our waitress seemed to be a little distracted. There were two of us so I asked for two waters and two iced teas. We got two iced teas and one water. No biggie, we just asked them to bring another water later. Then my friend ordered brown rice with her lunch special, the waitress repeated it back to her, and yet her meal came out with fried rice (which is chock full of stuff that she is allergic to). Despite her error with the order, she didn't subtract anything even though it was obvious that my friend didn't have any of the fried rice and she brought the error to the waitress's attention when she decided to check in on us again 20 minutes later. Again, the food was very tasty but the service was lacking today."}
{"text":"We have been fans of jade place for over 10 years. The BBQ ribs have been our favorite chinese ribs and they crispy chips and duck sauce have been a favorite as well. Today was very disappointing. The ribs tasted as if they were nuked. The chicken egg foo young was bland as was the Mongolian beef. The quality was not what we have been used to."}
{"text":"Great place, five stars instead of four because of authenticity and lunch prices.  Food is pretty great, egg rolls are really delicious.  When I say authentic this isn't direct from the streets of China, let's be serious you're in Arizona. But, being in Arizona and actually having dim sum deserves some acknowledgment. Lunch specials are awesome. Their food is not overloaded with sodium.   It is a clean place that is fairly 'nice', enjoyable to go in and sit down for a meal.  I see a lot of comments about old people which is kind of stupid. Old people like nice, quaint places to eat and appreciate good value for their money so yeah, I'm sure they come here. You should probably follow them everywhere as they have good taste. Can't say I noticed the median age being any different than anywhere else, but then again I'm not an asshole. Anyway, check out Jade Palace and enjoy the tasty cuisine!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant -   I like everything... from the white, clean table cloth, the skilled waiters looking polished and of course the fresh and delicious food.  Everything is cooked to perfection and the chef is willing to accommodate my special requests.  I have also noticed that the waiters are NOT asking if I'm \"still working on it\" - makes my skin crawl.  I was asked if I'm \"still enjoying my food\" - big difference.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great Food! We got the orange chicken, it was very crispy and delicious! Best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant mostly based on the location for ease of getting there from Fountain Hills for somebody who had not been to Arizona before and it's closeness to Sweet Republic.    To get the minor details out of the way.  I was reminded why I prefer tables to booths.  The seating was uncomfortable.  The only  other item was my chopsticks were so warped they were useless and I should have asked for another pair but instead gave up and used my fork.  We chose 3 entrees and all were good.  The serving size was appropriate for the target clientele.  If our group was 20 years younger we would have gone away hungry, as it was we ate about 90% of the food served.   Now what brings the 4th star is the service.  No heat orange chicken with red chile sauce on the side for me: no problem, Plum sauce on the side for the Mu Shu: no problem, Pictures of the group: no problem.  I have had this place bookmarked for some time and now I have been there it will remain on my list of places to go when I want a place to meet folks on the East side."}
{"text":"This place consistently delivers quality food. I have never been disappointed! I have read some of the reviews on here and I question the validity of them. This restaurant is consistently busy on weekends! If their food was as poor as some of these reviews portray it...this restaurant would be easy to get into on a weekend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Soup was wonderful and enjoyed my healthy shrimp and vegetables. Will be back again and aaim"}
{"text":"This place is really bad.  Not sure how you can have such bad service when its so empty but they pulled it off.  The food made me sick.  I am sure there are no stray dogs or cats in the area because the pork I had tasted like something totally different  Will not be back here.  What a waste of a meal"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a few days back.  Took over an hour when they said 30 minutes. They used a delivery service called zoom. Food was cold and gross."}
{"text":"I do not know what the food tastes like because it hasn't arrived at my house yet. This five-star golden review is directly related to my ordering experience over the phone with a gentleman named Michael. He was nothing short of fantastic and accommodating and offered numerous recommendations as we navigated our ordering  experience. Michael, if you are getting this message, from the bottom of my heart, from the future, thank you. Sincerely, Michael (not the \"double dragon\" Michael)"}
{"text":"Coming from Paso Robles in CA where the only Chinese food options are one sit down restaurant, one buffet and Panda Express, we were hoping to find some good Chinese food here!  We have been to Jade Palace to eat there twice now with take out once.  I have been pleased with the food every time.  The service is nothing more than order taking, but the menu is plentiful and the food is good.  I especially like the duck lettuce wraps and their style of fried rice.    It is close by, which makes it extra nice and always busy at night so I guess we're not the only fans."}
{"text":"Stay away unless you are a local who eats here all the time. My family and I were told that the wait was 30 minutes at 6 pm on a Friday night. We sat and waited for an hour and a half before we left without eating. The bartender, the hostess, and the owner all told us separately that our table was almost ready, you are next, and the table is getting up now. We watched as the locals came in and were greeted warmly and got a table in 10 to 15 minutes. I live 3 miles from Jade Palace so I am really a local as well but I am not over 65 years old and buddies with the owner. Worst Scottsdale service I have had in the past 11 years. Cannot rate the food this time because we ate at Jalape√±o Inferno next door. They did a great job and seated us within the 15 minute wait that they told us it would be. I will not be able to review Jade Palace again because they will never see me or my family again. I will take my business to Pei Wei  at Grayhawk where great service is always provided."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Also, the locale is upscale unlike the Jade Palace on Shea Blvd. If you can go to this Jade Palace skip their Shea Blvd. locale where takeout is spotty and unorganized as well as arrogant. Despite the negative reviews on Yelp they have done nothing to improve."}
{"text":"On Sunday, May 20th, 2018, we planned to have an early 4:30 pm dinner at the Jade Palace on Shea Blvd.in Scottsdale where we have been customers for years. This time we were greeted by cockroaches crawling up the wall of our booth as well on the back of the booth's seats. We called the attention to the waiter, who said he would call the manager who never showed up. We then spotted another cockroach crawling on the wall. That's when  I jumped out and went to get the manager who then on seeing the roaches rushed over. We left the premises never to return again. There was never an apology or regret expressed by management. The good thing is that we hadn't yet ordered. Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: I love this place!  Not only do they have the best upscale gourmet Chinese food in North Scottsdale, they have a super friendly staff and an opulent new location.   I had the pleasure of dining at Jade Palace last night and I was blown away. I've been to the new location before but it was only to pickup a to-go order I called in. Last night I got to enjoy the new location in all its glory and if is gorgeous.   We sat at the bar and even though there was a decent crowd, the service was among the most attentive I've experienced in a long time.  The manager and/or owner, Devlin personally greeted us with a hand shake and a giant smile.  He is an excellent host and his staff is super friendly, as well as knowledgable.   The food was incredible. I enjoyed one of the finest prepared filets of my life. It was cast iron skillet seared and out of this world. Yes. Steak in a Chinese restaurant!!!  Do yourself and your palate a flavor and trust me here. Order the filet! Medium Rare. I'm not even sure if it's on the menu. Ask for it.   Thank me later!  We also had an egg roll specially prepared extra spicy. It was delicious.   It's no wonder why this is the local go to place for gourmet Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Tried to give this place a chance as it was close to where weare staying. What a disapointment!! Waited nearly an hour for a soup and appetizers then another 20 minutes for the main and at least expecting it to be hot but was cold. Good thing is it wasnt too salty!! Food was mediocre, at best!!"}
{"text":"Went here as part of a party of four. Service was slow, General Tso's chicken and orange chicken were burned, teriyaki chicken was too sweet. Will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It is a serious, long-standing tradition in my family to seek out the best Chinese food possible when my parents and I visit my grandma in Arizona. My grandma never ceases her search to find restaurants that nearly perfect her shrimp-with-vegetables-in-a-garlicky-white-sauce request. Jade Palace, at 92nd and Shea, came pretty close tonight. She was one happy camper.  Also of note: the hot and sour soup (steaming and peppery); the royal nest (shrimp, scallops, and veggies in a brown sweet garlic sauce); mu shu pork (the vegetables were fresh and crunchy, the plum sauce just sweet enough).   The atmosphere is pleasant on the eyes, and also if you're eating with a friend with disabilities, they have a nice, convenient ramp up to the higher seating level.   So why not five stars, you ask? I'm waiting to be seriously wooed by Chinese food. Otherwise, Jade Palace is a surefire good meal."}
{"text":"Food was good . I did take out...they wouldn't honor the price on their take out menu and website menu. The dish was completely over priced. And in this case...the customer wasn't right...management didn't side with the customer."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a nice place with good service. Servers are nice and very friendly. For the food, my main dish Chicken Lo Mein, was way too greasy and there wasn't much chicken or vegetable in it. The restaurant doesn't put much thought into designing their lunch menu. My dish came with noodles and rice on the side. I usually expect the side dish compliments the entree, like salad instead of repeating it. The Wonton soup however was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Always great food and fast service. Called in my order instead of eating at the restaurant. The hostess was great and my food was ready when I arrived."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in AZ NYC style"}
{"text":"Visited with my fam for the first time last week. Food was amazing. A bit pricey for Chinese food. The place was packed on a Wed. night, but it was definitely an older crowd. I think my three kids were the only kids in the entire restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Been going here for over a year and it does not disappoint. Sometimes it gets a little crowded so make reservations. Love the crispy orange chicken and the Mongolian beef."}
{"text":"For our first visit to the north Scottsdale location we had a great time! The Royal Nest special was excellent. With perfectly cooked scallops, shrimp and vegis in a noodle bowl it was a treat. My wife's Moo shu pork was very good also.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at another restaurant we stopped in for dinner on a Monday. This is a more upscale Chinese food place. The ambiance is beautiful and we were seated and drink orders taken. Service was attentive and excellent. I had the egg drop soup and it was stellar. Rich and thick with lots of flavor. The NY egg roll was absolutely awesome. They are large and filled with meat and cabbage/spices. The Moo goo gai pan was one of the best Chinese dishes I've ever had. It's on par with San Francisco China town fare. I have found my new go to Chinese place in Arizona. Great job Chef and Owner your a star in the Desert!"}
{"text":"Went to Jade's Palace last night since we have not been there in a while. I mainly go for the New York Egg Rolls. The service was not great since it took 30 minutes to get our wonton soup and then they didn't bring our egg rolls out until another 15 minutes later.  I ask to ask our waiter where our food was and when it finally came out 15 minutes after the egg rolls, they forgot to put cashews on our cashew chicken.  Food was decent, but didn't make up for the wait.  Not to mention we were the youngest people in the place given that everyone else was on medicare."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout and called the wrong location. The people at Scottsdale were extremely helpful and put a rush on my order even though they were so busy people were waiting 40 minutes to get a table.  It took about 15 minutes to correct my mistake and complete my order. I was very happy with the service and the food was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Was craving for chinese food , so I found this place on yelp. Here I am. Not gonna lie the food was good, but still though its American-Chinese food. If you wanna have the real kungpao chicken ,pls reconsider it before you order their's, Im not saying their's are bad or something. It jus will blow your chinese mind. Lmao. And one more thing, the light is way too dim for me, I can barely see my food,JK."}
{"text":"Truly the best in Chinese food in Arizona. It can be hard to find New York style Chinese food but this hits the mark every time. Do you miss New York style Chicken Chow Main ? They have it and it is just like home"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and i was very impressed with the interior decor. Inviting and more upscale......i felt welcome the second i opened the door. The service was good and the food was delicious.  The only negative is the price but again.... You're in scottsdale Entree's are 12.99 or so and everything else is alacarte,  We spent a total of 50 bucks for 2 entrees, 1drink, 1 coke , small fried rice, tip Having said that, if i lived close by i would order take out and save a bunch."}
{"text":"After going to the Jade Palace and enjoying their in house service for years I must write that their take-away leaves much to be desired. We ordered the dinner size of Gran Marnier Shrimp, which is excellent, to take-away and much to our displeasure found that the portion was smaller than their Lunch size. Someone is not watching the kitchen and thus the service is spotty and you don't find out until you home what you got. If you want to eat their food go to the place and don't play Russian roulette with their take-away."}
{"text":"Came here with big group for dinner and we had a great time.  The food was delicious and the service was great, we were happy.  Beautiful table setting with red roses and candlelight, what more you can ask.  The waiters were so helpful and right there whatever we need. We event get dessert as a compliment for my sister & brother in law 40th anniversary celebration.  Thank you Jade Palace, we definitely will come back for more."}
{"text":"I went for lunch yesterday with few ladies and had a great time. I ordered Kung pao shrimp and it was excellent, although the rice was under cooked.  I went for dinner tonight with my family to the other location on pinnacle peak and the food was great. They had live mandolin music, it was beautiful!  They gave us blueberry sorbet for dessert as a compliment, that was delicious and was nice of them."}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food in Arizona, bar none.   You pay a little bit more here but it is absolutely worth it. The duck / plum sauce / crepes were all perfect. Egg rolls just like the ones in the Northeast. Actually good BBQ pork- not just candied pork bung. Noodle dishes on point and rice dishes superb. We may have over ordered a little bit to get a taste of different things, but the chef came to the table to check on us and how we liked everything- which was super nice of him.  The green beans were also a stand out of the meal.  Get some!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food with a high end atmosphere.  Consider making reservations as it was busy (we got lucky and got a table).  A lady played live music on an unusual string instrument, which nicely blended with the room."}
{"text":"They have a few different locations, all of which are very good.  I haven't gone wrong ordering anything on the menu.  Everything is fresh and very high quality.  Dinner can be expensive but the lunch specials are a steal.  Check out the coupons on restaurant.com if you want to save some $$$."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the food and service here many times.  This last time was exceptionally good.  We went on Christmas Day and the staff were very nice and not at all resentful about working on a holiday.  Our server was Karen and she was beyond great.  Attentive without being annoying, pleasant and quite charming.  The food was excellent and the wine, well, good wine!  It's a little pricey for our budget so we don't get to go as often as we'd like to, but it's never a disappointment when we do go."}
{"text":"FUCK this place pissed me off!  I want to say this about that first. I have been going to Jade Palace for years. Usually the location on Shea and 101. It is always great. The location on N. Scottsdale Rd is always great too. I am angry because there has been a change.....a CHANGE for the worst.   I hope this gets the OWNERS attention because you are much better than the garbage I got served Sunday Night. The Wor Wonton Soup was terrible. The wontons had a spec of pork inside and was mostly wrap. There were very little vegetables but the killer here was the broth, ah the broth by which ALL wonton soup is judged. It tasted like water with a mild wine flavor. White wine my exaggerated and noble palete detected. It was bad. The Twice cooked pork again had very little vegetables and the pork was white were the fat is. This is not a good sign. It means the pork was not hot enough for the fat to render again back into the dish making it a spectacular dish. The Grand Mariner Shrimp was good in flavor as usual however the shrimp were way too overcooked and relatively dry. The Egg Foo Yung was returned because it was terrible. The Salt and Pepper prawns were tasty, very good actually! You know something, the more I write the better the rating gets. We did have one exceptional dish! The Striped Sea Bass in Black Bean sauce was one of the best dishes I ever had from NYC to AZ. Bravo on that, it is KILLER!! They even serve it with fried Sea Bass Skin. The Beef Chow Fun was excellent as always. The orange chicken for the kids was DEE-SCUS-TING. The panda ear has more flavor and more identifiable meat.   This place is usually jammed wall to wall with New Yorkers who know they're Chinese. Tonight though, weird vibe. I felt like I was in Utah surrounded by Blue Hairs and Silver Foxes. It was almost Twilight Zonish. I will be back because for years I have enjoyed this place and I will update the next time too. Moved up 1 satr to 4 based on experience. Had this been my first time I would have given 1 Star ."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and are staying in a villas style hotel in the Kierland area. One night we felt like having Chinese Food delivered.  We have no previous experience of the delivery restaurants in Scottsdale. The hotel had a list of nearby restaurants. Jade Palace was on that list - however the hotel personnel did not have any experience by which to make a recommendation for Chinese Food delivery. We were on our own.  With a bit of time searching the internet we found Jade Palace's menu on line and found they had some of the best overall reviews of the local restaurants we found on line. At the time we placed our order the prices were slightly out of date on the online menu.  There are two Jade Palace locations - so make sure you use the one nearest to you. They quoted over an hour delivery - but the actual delivery time was only 40 minutes. The restaurant according to Google maps is about a 15 minute drive from our hotel. They charged $ 5 for delivery.  We really enjoyed the food that was delivered from Jade Palace.  What we ordered for two was:  - Pan Fried Dumplings - was Good - Sweet & Sour Chicken - was Good (a large size portion) - Grand Marnier shrimp - was Excellent - Baby Bok Choy w/Mushrooms - was Very Good - Moo Shu Chicken - was Excellent - Two of the dishes came with brown steamed rice - was a nice change from white steamed rice.  We are small to medium sized eaters and we have enough leftovers for a light dinner or lunch some other day.  Our hotel room had dinner ware and cutlery - however the Jade palace had offered delivery plates & utensils if we had needed it."}
{"text":"Delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and the food is better than your average strip mall Chinese place. We had the Egg Rolls which were big, like mini burritos; crab puffs, which were stuffed full of yummy stuffing and not tiny either; cashew chicken, which was tender and juicy and flavorful; and general Tso, which was crisp and full of fresh veggies. The service was fast and friendly as well. The only ding I would say is the prices, which are a buck or two more than what I'd say is average, but they gotta pay Scottsdale rent, so it is what it is. That wouldn't stop me from coming back though, and it shouldn't let you either,"}
{"text":"Jade palace is great!!!!  They have wonderful lunches, a very surprising wine list and they deliver too. I have dined here for over 20 years without a miss!!"}
{"text":"The reviews are right.. This restaurant takes Asian food up to the level of epicurean cuisine. Incredibly friendly and accommodating staff even with my rowdy 3 year old. The rib appetizer is to die for, and everyone enjoyed the meal. Order family style. Nice and convenient free valet service. Lots of \"mature\" clients dining, and that would be my only hesitation in bringing a child again. A must try if you love Asian in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit night & I had take out so I'll put that out there first. I love Sweet Republic and we go there often. JP is in the same section of this strip mall. It looks very nice and they always look pretty full. I had a craving for some chow fun yesterday so I had the chance to try this tonight. I went in and ordered the House Special Chow Fun. That usually gives a decent representation of how dry or juicy the meat is. As an afterthought I asked for no green onions. This usually means ANY onion but not here. I waited for about 8 minutes and then received my order in a 4-stapled closed paper bag. Guess I shouldn't look in on it til I get home! When I opened it I was disappointed to see exactly one piece of bbq pork on top. Stingy. I also happened to notice a piece of green onion. Great. So I started digging to see what they graced me with (for $12.95). I had 4 shrimps, and 4 pieces of chicken and pork. What I did have were a huge abundance of white onions (see my picture) (strike one) and a container full of soggy broken chow fun noodles. Anyone who knows about chow fun noodles knows to not over cook them and most definitely they must be long. Strike two. The flavor was blah and this dish just did not compel me to immediately make a Thanksgiving reservation!! Perhaps I'm a food snob. I dont know. I've eaten a lot of Chinese food in Vancouver, LA and San Fran. Unfortunately this dish does not even remotely compare. Yes, I know I'm in Phoenix. Sigh. I'll probably take my kids for a meal and get a better idea of their capability. But my first impression really, really sucks. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is an old favorite and even though they moved further from where I live, I make the drive. They have the best Chilean sea bass ever. I was surprised how good it was. I usually get my norm of sweet and sour chicken but my friend told me to try the sea bass and I was in love. It is one of my favorite Chinese places to go to, great service and excellent dishes!"}
{"text":"This was an okay place to try out. Crab puffs were mostly cream cheese, the fried rice was decent, the peppered steak was really very tender."}
{"text":"We came on Cinco de Mayo and this place was dead. It was 1pm and we were the only customers in the entire restaurant. This wasn't terrible as we got extra attention and double the wait staff. We opted to sit outside so we could enjoy the weather. There was a nice breeze, so it was extremely enjoyable. The patio is also really nice. You can see into another restaurant's patio, but a small man-made river parts the two patios. We took our time looking over the menu and finally decided upon the sizzling rice soup, the steamed dumplings, and the moo shu pork. Our soup and dumplings came out first. Our waitress put the soup together before our eyes, placing the rice into the pot to make it sizzle. It was very good - similar to an egg drop broth but with chicken, shrimp, peas, carrots, mushrooms and slightly crunchy rice. The dumplings were spectacular. Super soft and had a great flavor. Next, our entr√©e arrived. Our waiter actually filled and rolled our moo shu pork right in front of us. We've order moo shu pork at other restaurants and always have had to put it together ourselves. This was a nice treat to see it done for it. (He did a great job wrapping them!) Overall, it was a great experience. We'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"great food!! the girl on the phone was a little snarky and rude but the delivery guy was so nice! will be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"Last night I was seriously craving some good Chinese food, and remembered that a while back a friend had picked up some take out from the them and it was really good!  Arrived and the placed was SLAMMED, 30 minute wait - thankfully, there was a table opening up in the bar, so we grabbed it! Service was super friendly and efficient without be obtrusive. Ordered the sizzling rice soup, I had never had it before and it was delicious. There were 3 of us and we were easily able to share the soup for 2 among the three of us. For our entrees we shared an order of the Chow Fun Noodles with BBQ Pork, Spicy Home style Chicken, and the Double Dragon with had two kinds of shrimp, the Grand Marnier Shrimp and the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp.  Everything was DELICIOUS! My two personal faves were the Grand Mariner Shrimp, it reminded me of this shrimp dish I used to get when I lived in Los Angeles, I am so happy I know I can come here and get it when I am craving that sweet delectable dish, The spicy home style chicken was really good too, spicy while still being flavorful! The Chow fun noodles were great as was the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp. The rest of their menu sounded delicious and I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. One thing to know is that this place is PRICEY for Chinese food, our bill was $100.00.  A must if your in the area looking for some great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA!!!  FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WON-TON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME! (BY REQUEST)  I am from New Jersey and so are the owners.  They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here (1998) and I was delighted i could get a real NY egg-roll and spare ribs in Arizona.  Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken (or shrimp).  Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu it's that good!!  Taste's the same as the best of NYC.  Their lunch specials are amazing.  Comes with soup, spring roll, crab puff, fried rice, hot tea (by request) all for a very low price.  Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings.  This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time.  They all agree, REAL NY CHINESE FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Jade's palace probably had some of the best Chinese food I've had in AZ! Well cooked and very flavorful and most importantly not too salty. I got the shrimp and broccoli (sauce could've been better) and my boyfriend got chicken friend rice with Mongolian beef. I mixed a little of everything on my plate and it tasted great!!! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Overpriced wanna-be. Probably works for the North Scottsdale crowd (it's all show), but pretty mediocre food."}
{"text":"Consistently great Chinese food.  Have been here three times and never disappointed.  Recommend the BBQ pork ribs appetizer; and the New York egg rolls.  We go next door to Sweet Republic for dessert."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this restaurant about 1yr ago, and I've been hooked every since then. This is one of my favorite places. We just tell the manager, HU, what tastes we're in the mood for and he makes a suggestion. He's never been wrong yet. The food is so Yummy! Not sure what to order? Just ask HU.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered take out on a busy Saturday night. Staff was pleasant and order was ready fast. Worst General Cho's chicken we've ever had. The chicken was spongy and chewy. $60 for 3 entrees and none of them were anything I would save for left overs."}
{"text":"My first time here and I really enjoyed It ! I had the beef fried rice and the house shrimp with Jalape√±os and red Chile! Yummy   ! We sat in the bar and our server was Emily she was nice and Attentive ! My ice tea glass was never empty! I will recommend this restaurant to everyone"}
{"text":"Our favorite semi formal (white linens) Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale! The atmosphere is nice. Service is good. Food is great! Their sauces are light and flavorful! Moo Shu pork and Mongolian beef are must haves!"}
{"text":"Jade Palace is one of the better chinese restaurants in a town that's shamefully devoid of such a wonderful cuisine.  I won't argue the quality of the food that's served at Jade Palace, but when it comes to american chinese, this restaurant is much more american than chinese.  The lemon chicken is a perfect example of my argument.  It's pretty good, but little about it screams chinese.  It's served as two pieces of flattened fried chicken (it looks a lot like a schnitzel) cut into long strips.  Eating this dish with a pair of chop sticks is nearly impossible.  You'll at least need to use a knife to cut it down in size.  Nitpicking aside, I love the lemon sauce which mixes well with the chicken and rice.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Jade Palace is a hidden gem! The food is mouthwatering and the service is incomparable. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the Egg Rolls, the Pork Fried Rice (best in town), Orange Chicken.  Although all the servers are wonderful, Dominic was the most polite, knowledgeable, attentive and friendly of them all. Ask for him if you go! He always has the best recommendations and is happy to serve.  Haven't been disappointed yet and will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Do Not Eat Here!  The service is very poor. Brought my husband here for Fathers day dinner. The menu clearly  states that all meals have white chicken meat. When my son and husbands meals come, it is made with grizzely dark thigh meat. When I ask for the manager, he came after 10  min and argued with him how the menu didn't say white chicken meats for all  meals and people actually prefer dark meat. And then storms away.  We have never experienced any manager do this ever before. Then to end it all, the waiter.comes w a bill for the one meal and appetizers .  With restaurants closing every day in the valley, you would think this manager would have been more apologetic and took something off of the meal to keep  a customer. Don't waste your time on this restaurant. Go somewhere where the menu is correct and the service is great."}
{"text":"Great service, super fast to get our food! my kids love the fried rice, probably the best in town.  I had the General Tso chicken, very good, I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and I will continue to go here. I am not terribly picky with the food so I dont mind the occasional saltiness I have sensed in the egg drop soup which is one of my favourites. But I really like the ambience and decor at this place. It is quite perfect for a date."}
{"text":"I had received a $10 discount coupon in the mail which I didn't have with me but it made me curious because I LOVE Chinese food and it's very close to home.  The weather was nice and their patio looked inviting. I ordered a $11 glass of wine and disappointed that it was barely 1/3 of the glass full. I love Wor Wonton soup, so I ordered the smallest size, again disappointed; the chicken was in such large pieces, it should have been served with a knife; the wonton was the frozen kind that has hardly any meat and mostly wrap; the soup taste was decent as was the one shrimp. The boneless duck tasted good, but I had asked the waiter if it was \"crispy\" as it's my rule when it comes to duck.  It was not crispy, except for the thick skin, which I don't like, so I had to carefully remove the fat around the meat.  The dish listed vegetables which were so few, at first I thought they would come separately. I will give it another try, but I'll stick to the noodles or fried rice."}
{"text":"Genuine New York-style Chinese food! Excellent quantity, quality, and price. Best Chinese food in Phoenix metropolitan area."}
{"text":"Food was okay. We ordered BBQ pork fried rice (good), hot and sour soup (eh, could not eat it), BBQ rib appetizer (good), beef and broccoli (good), and chicken chow mein ( a mush of celery and bean sprouts, no noodles, and chicken). I was told on the phone that the chow mein was a crispy noodle dish. Maybe we got someone else's order?  We did take out, so cannot rate the service or dine in experience. Food is slightly over priced, but most Chinese restaurants are too."}
{"text":"Treat for the senses. Taste, smell and sight of the beautifully crafted dishes contributed to a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Happiness right from the appetizers to the dessert. Definitely my go to place for authentic Chinese cuisine. P.S: Lychee martini is a must try."}
{"text":"It's pretty tough to find decent Chinese in Scottsdale.  Jade Palace is an ok option if you have a serious craving for Chinese, but rarely will you think \"Gee, let's go to Jade Palace to get some quality food\". The food is mediocre at best.  Nothing really stands out on the menu.  I've been a handful of times because it's so close to where I live...each time I get something different hoping for the best.  Each time I walked away thinking I should have spent my money elsewhere. If considering Jade Palace, ask yourself this: Do I have a serious craving for Chinese that wont go away if I eat anything else?  Do I live within 5 minutes of Jade Palace?  Do I like dining with people who average 85 years old? If yes, go.  Otherwise move on..."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum is too American. It's not good Dim Sum for real Chinese. There was another Jade Palace in Chandler. The brothers open the store in different places, but the quality is no good any more. It was once my favorite Chinese Restaurant.  Please check out their Kitchen before order foods. See yourself."}
{"text":"I think they just recently changed owner or rename the restaurant. It was called Jade Palace and it's now called Phoenix Palace.   Don't go there. I was a royal customer. I stop going there when I had chance to see how they cook. Their Dim Sum is no long as good as Chainese's standard. It's too American style.   Just don't go there try the best Dim Sum at other location on N/W Ray and Alma School Rd."}
{"text":"Dishes tasted good.  We liked the window seating with Mountain View. Service was good."}
{"text":"Im surprised this place doesn't have a 5 star average rating. Food is by far the best chinese food in arizona, very cozy feel inside, the prices are unbelievabely reasonable for the type of food and service they provide. Owner is Leon that came up to our table a few times to check up on us and offer us a few shots of his tequila collection. He is very friendly and warm personality. We lovvvvve this place, everything is delicous!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here.  We love the general Tsao's chicken.  At lunch you get the best deals:  for about 10$ you will get a soup, a spring roll, a crab bite and a main course of your choice."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our first meal at Jade Palace! Thank you Davlin for an amazing tour of your menu. We will definitely return soon and refer our guests from Decantur Winery to your fine establishment."}
{"text":"We had take out here once and the food was very over priced,  meet friends there yesterday at their request and the food is okay but the prices are real expensive especially since the food portions are really small.  Everything is a la carte, you do not get soup and an egg roll with your entrees.  The chicken chow mein is really good and the same way they make it back east.  The dinner portion is very very small and comes with a very small bowl of rice white or brown.  They will not substitute fried rice and they only bring out the chips when you order either a soup or a entree.  We had to asked the waiter who I think was the owner more than 5x for chips.  The wor won ton soup really does not have any flavor and is a bit salty.  Very expensive for the amount of food you get...plus it is very  very cold in the restaurant and they would not lower the a/c. I had to put a sweater on and wished I had gloves...if you want less expensive good Chinese food with large portions try Qwik Chinese Bistro on 92nd & Via Linda which is where we wanted to go but they are now closed on Monday.   The food is just ok, nothing to write home about and the portions are really small they will not fill you up."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad meal there, but the other day I was craving some Won Ton soup. It did not disappoint. I got a large bowl so had enough left over to take home. The server was kind enough to add some more broth to the leftovers so that I later had a 2nd meal from my visit. She even put some of the leftover crunchy chips and dipping sauces in the to-go bag. I am ready to go back for more again. Their Moo Goo Gai Pan and pork lo mein are wonderful too."}
{"text":"WHY are we forced to even give ONE star???    It's over for this place. They have been surviving by a thread connected to their longevity and some die hard old timers. But the reality of the situation is that the owners just don't seem to care anymore and that has definitely trickled down to the front of the house staff as well as the kitchen.  2 years ago ((yes, I've been procrastinating on writing a review for quite some time)) I would've said that the food was inconsistent, however, in the last 18 mos it's been consistently awful. No taste, off taste, not cooked well, tasting old, not seasoned well.  I'm talking take out, ordering in (delivery) or eating in. Just NUTS. They are overpricing themselves like crazy but the kicker is that the food quality has been compromised to an insulting degree. Almost $20.00 for 4 ribs, that are either burned to death or dry and not fresh ... like reheated. The servings on the take out/deliveries have been skimmed ridiculously. This past weekend (I know, right? Gluttons for punishment we are) the sizzling rice soup for two had the smallest shrimp available, one size above the mini cocktail size shrimp. NOT shrimp cocktail size, but teeny salad size. Two wontons, two shrimp. SERIOUSLY? And the taste -- which for years I'd crave their soup -- was flavorless. The chicken was mushy.   The service ... OMG the service. From downright rude, dismissive, & at least about 3 weeks ago ... the most moody, lazy, sadsack, pissed off hostess I have ever encountered. She huffed all the way to the table, and we watched her do that to every couple who came in for lunch. The wait staff forgets you, forgets part of the order, no eye contact while taking the orders ... I can't!!!! Anyway, I don't want to continue, I'm over it. If you've been giving this restaurant your money for years & years ... wake up and take note, are you REALLY getting everything you're worth? Is the value worth your hard earned money. Does the person you're tipping only smile, look you in the eye and actually speak friendly to you when presenting the check? If NOT --- Then YOU NEED TO MOVE ON. That's the only way they are either going to step up to the plate or get off the field and make room for a new restaurant. BTW ... we know the owner personally ... for many, many years ... and though we've mentioned here & there what seemed to be happening, assuming he would appreciate knowing, it's become abundantly and painfully clear he just no longer cares.  Not MY money ... no more!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Jade!!!  As a girl from back East, moving out here was a culinary blowjob.  Pizza, Chinese, Italian, ethnic food - all was sorely lacking in bounty and taste.  Then, we found Jade Palace.  The owner is from Brooklyn, and truly gets East Coast chinese.  I have NEVER had a bad meal or experience here - whether for dine-in or take-out, and my family eats here at least once a week.  Best things on the menu:  Egg rolls (real chubby kind from back East - not the spring roll most pass off as an egg roll), BBQ ribs (so meaty and zero fat), Skewered beef (well seasoned and tender).  All of the fried rices are excellent (pork is my favorite).  For entree you can't go wrong with the half duck (the sauce that comes with it is to die for), shrimp or lobster cantonese, mongolian beef, general tso's chicken, and the chow funs are yummy.  Best part, they give you the wide chinese fried noodles I could make a meal on in itself.  Bar none, THE best Chinese in the Valley."}
{"text":"Food = Awesome. I had the tofu and veggies. Every thing was fresh and tasty. Husband had hunan beef. He said it was tasty, ingredients were obviously fresh. Service was also awesome. We went at 1 pm on a Sunday. So it was quiet. Everyone on CCIBB said this was the best place for Asian food. I'll agree. Also they offered to send me home with extra rice to go with my leftover tofu. THat was a generous touch.   The back tips of the booths need a serious vacuuming. That is my only criticism."}
{"text":"Went there before and the food was really good. However we took the half hour ride 2 weeks ago. Called on the way down to make sure they where open and got some strange answer about how they are open till 10:30 but close the doors at 10. Seemed strange but ok. Got there at 9:50 and the girl said they where done accepting customers for the night because it was 10. I said but it's not 10 and we just called 20 minutes earlier and was told come on down. She just stared and smiled. She would not budge. I could not believe it. Asked to speak to a manager and was met with the same creepy stare and smile. It's was odd. They just wanted to get out early.  I'm sure the owners would not be happy. Needless to say, they lost our business for good and also Avnet's (biggest company in Az) marketing departments monthly lunches where I manage. So upsetting."}
{"text":"The beef lo mein is great!!! My favorite Chinese place in Phoenix! Their egg rolls are a great menu item too!"}
{"text":"Louise Stothard Scottsdale, AZ     Jade Palance not only has excellent food, the waiter service is unbelievable in this day and age  We just stopped in for a very late lunch/early dinner about 5:00 pm .  So impressed by an actual professional waiter and his fellow waiters, I had to mention to the manager.    I had intended to post this the next day, but as things alwaysgo, I am a bit late.  But I am finally giving the Jade Palace the praise that is their due!   EXCELLENT ?Jade Palace.  Here we had attention and care reminiscent.  a long time ago!"}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of Japanese food, always fresh seafood specials each night. Excellent service"}
{"text":"My wife looked at the menu online and wrote a list of dishes for me to pick up for take-out. Service was pleasant and fast. She thought the food was great -but it's my review and I would judge the food \"acceptable.\"  I say this with the full understanding that Chinese food appreciation varies wildly from one individual to another. That said, here goes dish by dish. The vegetarian fried rice was well prepared and delicious. BBQ ribs were tasty with a nice crust that may have been a bit burned. Let's call it well charred. The meat was dry even though the ribs were large and meaty. Mongolian beef was excellent. General Tso's chicken was meaty, nicely sauced and just minimally spicy. My favorite dish at almost any Chinese restaurant is Kung Pao chicken. I love the heat a good Kung Pao has. This was flavorful, but had no heat at all. It was, by far, the least of the dishes we had.   Would I go back?  Probably so. But, I would not order the ribs and I would specify a heat level for the Kung Pao."}
{"text":"After a long drive from California with a sick mom, we needed food! So travel weary and sloppily dressed we decided to order take out from Jade Palace. I walked into a beautiful restaurant with a very gracious hostess who sweetly greeted me. The food was amazing. The portions were large and tasty. Definitely recommend this place. Oh and BTW this was off season and it was busy!"}
{"text":"Jade Palace is a rare example of exceptional quality, atmosphere and service.  The food is top notch traditional Chinese, using high quality meats and produce, along with excellent presentations.    The lounge is a fun atmosphere with attentive bartenders that really know their drinks!  Bring a group of friends in and you are guaranteed a great experience.  I do wish they would promote and go deeper into a happy hour menu, but perhaps in time.  Special thanks to bartenders/servers Emily and Sara who have always treated me well, their professionalism, attention to details and drink craft goes a long way to creating a fun place to grab a meal and relax!"}
{"text":"Really good, clean tasting (even the fried dishes) Chinese.  The clientele can definitely trend toward snow birds occasionally, but it is definitely worth putting up with the surrounding conversations centering on what is going on in Boca, especially the exceptionally tender beef in the flavorful but not too greasy chow fun, which pairs particularly well with the Szechuan (sp?) garlic chicken and if you are looking for a sweet mildly spicy hit either the General Tso's chicken or the orange beef pairs well also: unfortunately, I have had a really hard time finding spicy chinese food in AZ, even when requesting extra spicy/adding chile oil as a condiment.  Their duck sauce tastes really fresh made, and their hot mustard is really well balanced, definitely give it a try even if it is not usually your favorite.  One nice feature that they have is their packaged meal deals, the Deluxe version is an absolute steal: for around $23 a person, you get your selection of soup (which I always get the sizzling rice soup, with good sized shrimp, big tender chunks of chicken in a nice rich clear broth with still slightly crispy veg and of course the crispy rice), 2 spare ribs, 1 egg roll, 1 beef on a stick, and one choice of a premium entree (lots of good choices, ranging from chunks of filet migion called steak kew to various other beef, shrimp and chicken dishes), and the nice part is the entire dinner scales up for however many people you have: I am a big guy, and this is more food than even I go for in a single sitting..."}
{"text":"So we called ahead to see if they were crowded before we ventured out. The Chinese lady said no wait. We showed up 30 mins later and were told there was 30 minutes wait. Sheez. While we waited, noticed the lobby looked a bit run down and dirty though lights were dark / to hide that fact. We left."}
{"text":"Epic disappointment! The only good thing about this review is going to be the nice hostess that took care of our carry out order. We thought we would try this place because it's always busy and love Asian cuisine however, once we started eating it we were disappointed. We ordered the general tso's chicken and I am pretty sure it wasn't chicken. Each bite (between the two orders of it) was all gristle. If it wasn't all gristle it was a chunk of the cooked batter. Considering this is a dish that most restaurant's can nail down, I'm sure we won't be back to try the rest of the food. For the price of it, I would hope the quality of meat they use was higher than what we experienced in the two orders of chicken. My advice: maybe try the miso soup, it's probably less hard to ruin."}
{"text":"Amazing as always! Food, service, and people are so great. We live in South Chandler and won't eat Chinese anywhere in the valley except here. Lots of food goes home with us. Try the sizzling beef and scallops."}
{"text":"Expensive. Two people, two egg rolls, pot stickers, Mongolian Beef, Chicken dish. $80.   And to top it off, one of the dishes contained peanuts, which I'm allergic to. And NO mention of peanuts listed on the menu.   Had an anaphylactic reaction two hours after eating, including swollen eyes and tightening in my throat.  Luckily two Benadryl later and I survived.   With the prevalence of peanut allergies, why would you ever put them in Chinese food (most likely peanut paste to make it taste better...I suspect the $8 egg roll)?  Not returning."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's been a family favorite since we discovered it about 10 years ago. Haven't ordered one thing that I haven't enjoyed and the atmosphere is great. A little pricey for frequent visits, but it's definitely worth the splurge.. in our case, about 2-3 times/month. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This is the  best Chinese food in the valley bar none and I've had the chance to compare many and can only compare to some of my favorite Chinese spots from back east. Awesome fried rice, Kung pao, chow mein (white noodle) and float mignon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.  Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good.  My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food.  Definitely, try the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Jade is one of my all-time favorite places for high quality Asian cuisine and incredible atmosphere. My coworkers told me about this place a couple years ago and I've loved it ever-since. Now with the new location, it's been taken to the next level. The owners take extreme pride in making sure your experience is the best. The food; incredibly well thought out and prepared."}
{"text":"Incredible food, unbelievably perfect customer service. was brought here with some good friends from work. absolutely the only option if you want not just good chinese food but an experience with employee's who remember everything you like for the next visit in. my first visit was great, my second visit sold me."}
{"text":"Love this place! Being from back east originally, I'm super picky when it comes to good Chinese food. I'm seriously ADDICTED to their hot and spicy eggplant.  Love that sauce! I haven't had one bad dish here and I think I've tried probably about half their menu. It's a great place for a relaxing dinner or lunch or the perfect spot for takeout. Go there!!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese the other night, so my boyfriend and I decided to check out Jade Palace.  It was nicer inside than I thought it would be...the restaurant felt intimate, and most diners kept pretty quiet, so it was a relaxing atmosphere.  The servers were very attentive, and more than once we had different servers coming up to ask us if we needed anything else.  The food was great- we shared spring rolls, veggie fried rice and veggie low mein and it was more than enough.  They also give you a generous portion of wonton chips with this amazing sweet orange sauce and a bowl of white rice.  Our total was around $23 for all of this, so prices are pretty reasonable.  There are more expensive dishes on the menu, but luckily for us, we don't eat meat.  If you do, you could end up paying anywhere from $12-20 for a meal.  I definitely recommend this place. It's in a strip-mall (what in AZ isn't?) and it's easy to see from Shea.  Oh and the portions were big enough that we even have leftovers for today! Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! First time in and not disappointed. We had the lettuce wraps and the peking duck pancakes and a chicken fried rice. The peking duck was amazing.  I haven't found anywhere in AZ yet that does this and its something I have craved from the uk for so long. Our waiter was really helpful and attentive. I will definitely be making this a regular for chinese food."}
{"text":"I love the Jade Palace, in this part of Scottsdale it is hard to find locally owned Chinese dining. The food is excellent for the Phoenix area and almost as good as it is in New York and San Fran. They have all the classic and specialities like Steak Q which are delicious and well prepared! I love their potstickers and fried rice!"}
{"text":"This my favorite Chinese Place in AZ..I'm from Michigan the food  here is just awesome...I love shrimp egg foo young..here it's mixed into the patty which I'm a custom too.. I hate it when the patty just have shrimp on top.. Jade Place is made to order.. I've been coming here for 10years... I live North Peoria... it's worth the drive.."}
{"text":"This is a more upscale Chinese restaurant and the price reflects it. It has a small vase of real flowers on the clothed table. My first visit was on a Saturday night and there was live music from guzheng, a Chinese zither. We had a calamari steak for appetizer. A sizzling Chilean sea bass plus a traditional beef chow fun (stir fried flat rice noodle) All tasted great. Our server Sarah was attentive and courtiest. The wine list is good but pretty pricey.  In the picture with the vase, you can see the tiny bottle of Sake which was $16. The restaurant was pretty busy and was full when we were at the middle of the meal.   We went again about 10 days later on a weekday and it's not as busy. We tried the summer special of a 5 course meal $28/person. 1st is a U12 prawn with broccoli, carrot, onion and water chestnut. Then a U10 scallop on top of a button mushroom. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of these 2 dishes. Both are delicious. 3rd plate was a real disappointment, the Peking duck lettuce wrap, it's way too salty. The homestyle spicy chicken was good but would be better to go with white rice. The final plate was the beef tenderloin which IMO was the best of all. It came with a small bowl of fried rice. If you like, you could have more white or brown rice but we felt the amount of food was perfect and no need for more carbohydrate. The evening ended with a sorbet dessert which all we saw all customers had. Although no free dessert was available on Saturday night."}
{"text":"I am rating this 5 stars simply based on the food; it is magnificent! I ordered the chicken chow mein, and I've been thinking about it ever since. It was fantastic, I mean out-of-this-world good. Perhaps I was just very hungry, but I have to say, these were some of the best noodles I've tasted in years. The chicken and veggies (which are mixed in) were also quite tasty. I will definitely keep coming back for more, because China Jade serves delicious food. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Best chinese I have had so far in the valley.  Atmosphere is 10/10 -bar is great for a quick meal and some football on thursday night Friendly staff - check Food - 10/10 --Had beef mongolian and general Tso's chicken and it was great. going to try filet next time for sure.  If only they delivered......"}
{"text":"This is one way f my favorite places.  It is consistent, the service is good, the food is New York style so to be able to order great egg rolls and mouth watering spare ribs keeps me coming back again and again.    They offer a wide variety of entrees, some the traditional stir fry etc, but they offer a selection of things like sizzling sea bass, my husbands favorite, as well as crispy duck cut into pieces with the bone in that you can eat with your fingers.  When I don't order that one, I order either the spicy eggplant or the home style bean curd and thinking of all 3 has my mouth watering, especially with their fried rice dishes, darn!  Enjoy......."}
{"text":"Having grown up on the north side of Chicago and having family that traveled the Orient, I'll tell you straight-up, it's a challenge to find \"true\" Chinese food in AZ.  That said, Jade Palace remains at the top of my list!  I've tried almost every Asian restaurant within 10 miles of here, and while JP is not as trendy or well-known as some (side-eye to Flo's and a family of \"sons\"), IMO, it's definitely the BEST!!!  My current fave dish is the Terriyaki Chicken. Super tender, sweet, and delicious!  Also the Pork or Chicken -Fried Rice and/or Mushu Pork.  Lettuce Wraps are also fantastic as is their Egg Drop Soup!!!  Simple-type recipes and simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have been going here for many years.  The food always comes out hot and fresh.  The hot n sour soup is  one of the best in the valleys, alongside Flo's.  I really enjoy all of their dishes.  Portions are plentiful and it reminds me a lot of the food I would get back east."}
{"text":"I arrived after closing and they still let me order take out AND a glass of wine while I waited. I just asked what I should have and let them decide just to make it even easier. I enjoyed a glass of wine while my spicy chicken was prepared. Stephanie helped me. She was super sweet even after closing.  The owner/manager/GM was also all about getting me dinner and not at all about closing shop. He was a gentleman.  I drove back to the Four Seasons and enjoyed every bite of my egg roll and spicy chicken. Delicious and absolutely worth the price and the drive."}
{"text":"I'm of Japanese-Chinese heritage, my Cantonese father was a novice chef of Cantonese cuisine and taught me starting at age 10.  I KNOW CANTONESE COOKING.   My husband and I moved to PHX/Scottsdale from the east coast 17/18 years ago. We moved to the area not knowing anyone or where reputable Chinese restaurants were located. Until we found Jade Palace on Pinnacle Peak/Pima Rd...   The service is impeccable; in addition to the familiar dishes we all know and love, Jade Palace creates imaginative specials to bring artistic flavors together for a whole new Chinese gastronomic adventure.   There's NOT too many Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale that are owned and operated by a Chinese restaurateur. Jade Palace \"knows their client's palate and their appetite\", they know what to bring to the neighborhood~that's why they're successful!!!!  You will not regret your dining experience.   ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Jade is a great spot. It's a little high end, but the food is worth it. Each dish has flavorful meats and vegetables cooked to perfection with lovely sauces. They have all the dishes you would expect to see, but just a touch more flavor and quality than you might see at your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.   There is also a location on Pima that is great as well."}
{"text":"Why this restaurant has a loyal clientele, I don't know. I had Kung pao Beef, that was not Kung pao Beef. The meat was quality and lean, but the dish was a far cry from Kung pao. The other dishes we had were also average. First and last time unfortunately for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ugh sooooo good! The orange beef is amazing and they are always so fast. Even their take out is fast and always delicious. Quality Chinese food, best in Scottsdale area for sure :)"}
{"text":"Wow this was a great find.   Great food, good wine selection.  Nice bar area for socializing.Highly recommend for eating in or take out!"}
{"text":"Christmas Eve tradition! Always a wait- make reservations. Don't expect fancy anything- just good Chinese food at decent prices with quick service."}
{"text":"Glad this is here - I was bummed when the Hayden location closed. This is a feast for $20 - I shared an entr√©e (lettuce wraps), had huge meal, a drink! The atmosphere is dark and upscale and would make for a romantic date night. Expect attentive here service too."}
{"text":"I am happy to have found this place - I put off trying it for what seems like years... I am so glad I finally popped in here for lunch yesterday! I love their egg drop soup (which comes included with most of the lunch specials). I tried the Kung Pao Beef today and while it could have been a little spicier, the ingredients were ultra fresh and delicious. The crab puff and spring roll were perfect! Good vibe, and the staff is 100% on the ball."}
{"text":"My quest to find good chinese food in the east valley or Greater Phoenix for that matter has finally found a bright spot. I have tried 3-4 other chinese spots and had pretty much abandoned my search because nothing was even close to the quality I got in Chicago. But finally, on a recomendation from a friend, I gave this place a shot. Wow! it was actually good. In fact , the best I've had around here. Yes, decent Chinese food. I didn't venture far from standard dishes,however, as I sampled egg rolls, crab puffs, egg drop soup and cashew chicken. All were above average. I ordered to go, but the dinning room looked nice. I will be back to further explore the menu"}
{"text":"Jade Palace is a pretty good option for Chinese food. Proximity to home is always important to us since we typically make our dinner plans at the last minute.   I have to agree with Gabi, they make a point to say hello right away and not just one person. Several people made sure we knew they'd be right with us. The hostess was on the phone taking a to go order.  They have the typical choices most Chinese places have including a couple healthy options one of which I ordered, the steamed chicken and vegetables. I'm also partial to places that offer the option of brown rice. My partner ordered cashew chicken and reported it was delicious.  So the moral of the story is we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best chinese food I have tried in Scottsdale.  My parent go here all the time.  The owners are very friendly and stop by our table at least twice a visit.  They always hook us up with a pretty unique deserts.  Their Chilean Sea bass is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Do yourself a favor and try it.  The cocktails are also really good.  The bartender pours a strong drink and always has a story to tell.  He seems to be there everytime we go.    TRY THIS PLACE OUT."}
{"text":"I can not emphasize enough how AWESOME the Spare Ribs are. I will say it again. The Spare Ribs are the most awesome Spare Ribs in the world. I grew up on New York Chinese food every Sunday with the Family. These are the most awesome Spare Ribs I have ever had. Everything i have had here is incredible.  The Pork Fried Rice is sooo delicious. Egg Foo Young as tasty as it gets. Peking Duck, Perfect! There is usually always an Eggplant Special stuffed with Shrimp. I am not a big Eggplant person but this dish is INCREDIBLE! Whether you like eggplant or not try it once. I guarantee you will fall in love. This is the best Chinese outside of New York.  Do not confuse traditional Chinese food to New York style Chinese food. This is NY Style and it ROCKS! If you want to try some traditional, Make a reservation during the Chinese New Year. They do an amazing job. Service is always efficient and friendly. Average visits to this place about once a month for the past 11 years. Never a single issue. The new location looks and feels great. Love the bar area when just a few of us but dining works great when we are 5 or more. In case you need some reminding, SPARE RIBS, AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I honestly, for the life of me, dont understand how this place has such a high rating. I mean, the people who work here are nice enough, but the food is sooo nasty. I got the lunch special, sweet and sour chicken, lo mein (which was $2 extra), and egg drop soup. My soup literally had pieces of something in it, i think it was scrapings from the pan they cook it in, but not sure, there was also no flavor at all. The lo mein I paid extra for was just noodles, i had 2 slivers of green onion, but thats about it, and the sweet and sour chicken was just deep fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce on the side, no onion, veggies or pineapple. This was the least satisfying chinese I've ever had and the restaurant was extremely dirty, no one had gloves or anything. I'm just hoping I don't get sick at this point. If you want flavor, go somewhere else. You're welcome."}
{"text":"The food is consistently great; The service is above par; the decor & ambiance are great and the overall atmosphere is very good! A couple of visits ago we had a 1-1/2 hour wait - unexpectedly - and we were treated like royalty by the Manager & the Bartender. When we were finally seated the service was with a smile & an apology. Even when you need to make a small change to the menu item - there is never a problem! VERY accommodating!  CLASS ACT throughout! Going back tonight!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give Jade Palace another try, we have been to their Shea location and were not too impressed with the menu. I am Chinese and we were look for a chinese restaurant to celebrate the Lunar New Year. We didn't have reservations but were willing to wait for a table when we were told the wait might be 15 mins. So we waited and we watch tons of people get seated. Then the last straw came when they sat 2 groups that walked in as we stood waiting with no reservations get seated. So we left and I will no be going back ever again nor would I recommend them to anyone. They seem to only want to take care of their regulars which is great but new clients are important too and they did not seem to care."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Jade Palace totally reminds us of what we used to experience as what great New York Chinese food tastes like."}
{"text":"Much nicer inside than you might expect from the street.  Good service, and everyone in our party enjoyed their meal.  Those who ordered a spicy dish commented that it wasn't hot at all.  I liked all of the seafood choices on the menu."}
{"text":"We have been here with a large group and just another couple and have been pleased with our food in both circumstances. Nice atmosphere and a patio to dine on in good weather."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this fine restaurant. The food and service are very, very good. We have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly staff, nice, clean atmosphere.  Highly recommend! I've been to their Shea, and Pima Rd locations, and they are both great!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this but Jade Palace has lost its quality over time. I'm not so sure the owners care very much any more, other than being greedy with the prices. On a most recent visit for take out, the food I ordered was just very greasy and oily. The only items that were very good were the egg rolls. Unfortunately, on my visit before last to dine on the premises at Jade Palace, we could not be seated although we had a reservation and the restaurant seemed overbooked without even an apology, nothing. So after waiting for nearly 40 minutes, we ended up having dinner at Mastro's right next door.  The hostesses are always very nice and welcoming. However, what's important to me is the quality of the food. My bill was nearly $ 70.00 dollars and for that price, I should be eating super delicious chinese food, but instead I was super disappointed with the quality and freshness of the food. I have given Jade Palace enough chances over the years but this time  I won't return."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food, convenient, inexpensive and take-out is always a snap. If Tatum is working, you are guaranteed to have a great experience. She is one of the most gracious hostesses I know.  The variety on the menu is outstanding. I usually order the Szechuan (spelling ?) garlic chicken with brown rice as it is my favorite dish and comes with plenty of vegetables.  Best nights to go are also the busiest nights: Friday and Saturday as there is a lady that plays Chinese guitar that is delightful and adds a nice ambiance to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of best Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale. The food is amazing and they also have a nice atmosphere if you want to sit down. Otherwise take out is an option to"}
{"text":"Great service from Ian, and great food. We are from MN and have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant. This place is it! Good portions and, the owner swings by your table to check in. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy.....  Love the New York Egg rolls and the consistency of the food.  Unfortunately, I have not tried a lot on the menu, but everything so far has been great."}
{"text":"We went to jade palace on a Thursday for lunch.  Purchased an nice bottle  of Pinot Grigio to go with our choices off the lunch menu.  We had moo goo gai pan and chicken lo mein. They always have excellent food! Service was beyond excellent. The two staff members kept an eye out for our every need.  In fact I am going for p/ u of the same food choices right now!  Need I say more!"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. Unlike any other Chinese restaurant. Fine dining, excellent cuisine, and great service. Unique dishes including ginger beef tenderloin, peppered chicken and duck lettuce wraps. All done to perfection and served beautifully. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"The food here is impeccable!  The owner really knows what he is doing. Come check out the tapas and the little plates too!"}
{"text":"Worth a try. Saturday night, about 8 p.m. Slight wait. Live music. Noisy entry and bar.  Tile entry floor next to the bathroom entry and bar might be a bad idea. Too many people milling about. Glassware kept being dropped. Broken glass risk for everyone. And, a cost that adds up.  Upon being seated, the decor of the dining room, soft booths, carpet, etc. helped to dampen the noise very well.  I'm not sure what kind of instrument the Asian woman was seated in front of and strumming. But, she was doing - for the most part - a nice job. Later in the evening she launched into a full rendition of the theme from The Godfather. Really? An intense Italian mob movie? In a Chinese restaurant?   The menu looked appealing. We had the sizzling rice soup. It didn't sizzle. That was new for me. But, the shrimp and other proteins within were well seasoned and tasty. After we were finished - completely - with the soup, our waiter approached to say he'd lost the ticket for our entrees. We reconstructed it and he said he'd \"give us some time first.\" Excuse me? Drop that ticket now, please!  We had the kung pao three delicacies. No POW to the kung pao. I mean zero. Not even a hint. Disappointing. The beef was tender and flavorful. The shrimp was good. The scallops were OK. We had the pork special. Tender yet very fatty cuts of pork.  Dessert was confusing. We would have looked at - and possibly ordered from - a dessert menu. But, the waiter cut us off and asked if we wanted complimentary blood orange sorbet. Sure! It was the best item we'd had tonight.  Side note: I don't know the story, but a diner wasn't happy about something. A manager approached. Discussion followed. All I could here the manager say, over and over, was \"I don't want to make an exception.\" After the diner left, not sure if it was resolved, I could here this manager discussing the story with what appeared to be a regular and a server. I didn't appreciate this. Maybe the customer was in the wrong. But, be quiet about it and vent behind the curtain out of sight of patrons!  Not likely to return. But, glad to have given it a try."}
{"text":"Jade Palace has the best Chinese food in town! We are not even big on Chinese food but whenever we want it, we come to Jade Palace.  We were here last night and the weekend before as well. Our waitress Sarah did an excellent job and she remembered us and our food allergies.  Last night we started off with egg drop soup. It was excellent! I had the filet and shrimp in brown sauce and my husband had the shrimp with lobster sauce.  My son had the rice noodles with beef. Everything was very good as per usual."}
{"text":"We went to Jade Palace on the suggestion of a local while we were on a visit to Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is nice with indoor or outdoor dining options.  The service was very good.  The thing that will keep you coming back is the food.  We were with a group of 4 and decided to order 3 entrees and a couple of appetizers and share it all family style.  We had Cashew Chicken, Beef with Snow Peas and a dish named Double Dragon which was shrimp prepared two different ways.  They were all delicious, but if I ever have the opportunity to go back, I will not be able to resist ordering the Double Dragon, mmmm...good!  Granted, I live in the Midwest and do not frequent Chinese restaurants all that often, but this is the best one I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised the reviews are so good. This is one of the few times Yelp has let me down. The service was quite poor, but more importantly the food was just a little better than decent. Portions were small and overpriced. I'm not the chain restaurant type but I would rather eat at Pei Wei anytime. In fact, I think the quality of the ingredients is below Pei Wei. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We recently tried this place and the food is amazing. The food is seasoned very well. The service is excellent. They are very busy. I highly recommend making a reservation even for a weekday. Love this place & we will be back."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese, especially dumplings and stopped in for lunch. As a New Yorker and eating Chinese in Flushing (the best spot when craving Chinese), this restaurant was pretty good. We started with dumplings and spring rolls. Dumplings with dipping sauce were tasty, would have liked an even thinner wrapper. They did hit the spot. Spring rolls on the other hand were fresh and crisp, but inside was a bit bland and sauce a little sweet. We then had the special chow fun. Very nice dish with noodles, shrimp, chicken, pork, onion and scallions. Very nice."}
{"text":"I usually will dine in, but I decided to order take out.  I was impressed with how quick it was delivered.  My only gripe is that the General Tso Chicken was over cooked and hard to eat."}
{"text":"Duck lettuce wraps, a special treat tonight when paired with a light red wine--wonderful pairing.   The shrimp was lack luster in the white cream sauce. Service great, would come again just pick a different dish."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best hot & sour soup I've ever had!! We ordered the Mongolian Beer, Garlic chicken with mixed veggies & moo mgoo Gia oh pan. The lunch specials are great and a lot of food!! You also get a good serving of soup. Ivy was our server and she was so sweet and great! This place also delivers and it's pretty kid friendly. Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out, having a variety of menu items, moo shu chicken, cashew chicken, baby bok choy and mushrooms, eggplant, fried rice, orange chicken and a couple of other items. Our order was ready within minutes and it was all correct! Absolutely everything we ordered was just delicious! Luck for us, we ordered a lot of food because we finished all of it!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday when my family was in town and thought it was phenomenal!   We ordered a few entrees - beef chow fun noodles, Bbq pork fried rice, crispy orange chicken, and a whole roasted duck.   Everything came out perfect and the duck was to die for. I give this place 5+ stars. It's a little more on the pricey side but it's a more higher end Chinese restaurant. You definitely get your money's worth!!"}
{"text":"We came down from Dewey and will again!!! The service was the best we have had anywhere in a long time and the food was amazing. I wish I could give it more stars."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, high-class presentation, fantastic service, generous portions, great food.  Came here with some work colleagues for dinner and had a very lovely time - I would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"THANK YOU DAVLEN!   I greatly appreciate your response to my review.  As you requested, you asked for another chance.   I called you this past Saturday. We spoke at length about my previous experience.  You took my 'usual order', and assured me that it will be given your attention to make sure that our order was prepared accurately.  When I picked up the order and we shook hands, I felt reassured that all would be OK.  Your attention to detail and customer service is outstanding!!!!!  BTW - My order was 'spot on' and over the top delicious!  I look forward to placing many more take out orders and continuing to being your customer and shaking hands in the future."}
{"text":"I have read on Yelp that some people have experience poor service at Jade Palace.  Well, I thought those are people that are not use to the Chinese ways of doing things and they expected their waiters to at their center of the universe.  I was wrong.  So I came in on a fairly busy night with a friend.  We were seated and the waiter came immediately not asking for drinks but for our orders.  We need a few more minutes.  That few minutes turned into 15 minutes.  I had to complain to the host before the waiter arrived to take my Sea Bass and Green Bean order.    During 15 minutes wait, I noticed our waiter was selectively server all the \"elitist\" in our society.  If you don't get what I mean; IT'S THE FREAKING WHITE PEOPLE.  She ignored all the colored people in the room.  The Latino couple had to motion for her to server them several times before the waiter arrive.  My table didn't get the tea or the complementary won-ton wraps.  While I saw the white couple who came in 10 minutes after us got whatever they wanted.  Anyhow, we got cold after the food was order.  We drank ice water because our tea hasn't arrived.  Given it's already 15 minutes, the waiter must have ignored me.  So I motioned for the host to get me hot water because we were just cold.  She told me she will.  The host disappeared for 5 minutes and I don't see her.    So I stood up and asked for our waiter to give us some hot water/tea because we are cold.  I did not get the hot water/tea.   Instead I see the waiter got wine for the table next to me and continue to chat with her customers and ignored my table. She could have said\" water is coming\".  Instead she continued on her way to do other things.  I was too cold to hope that she may get me some hot water/tea.  I told my friend we are leaving and are going to somewhere else.  We went to 92nd Street and Caf√© for food instead.  The waiter was not remotely being discrete about her racism.  For the past 20 minutes, I noticed that she ignored all the colored people in the room, but made sure that all the white people were being server.  She will only stop and \"respond\" if the colored person ask for things.  She will provide great service (check in, chat, etc) with the white people.  This waiter ignores anyone that is a darkie(Anyone that is not white.  I was highly disappointed that she validates all the poor service comments on Yelp.  There is no need to treat people this way.  Money is money.    I can't comment on the food/tea/wine/won-ton wraps because my friend and I were being ignored.  I can only comment on the water and it's just tap.      You will have a good time at Jade Palace if you are WHITE AND DRESSED AS IF YOU HAVE MONEY. For the rest of us that don't have the lighter skin pigment, stay away from this place. But if you have to go; stay away from this waiter.  I can't remember her name because she ignored my freaking table.  She is tall; slender, had a pony tail, and ASIAN and speaks perfect English.  We sat at the wing immediately to left of the building.    I'm planning tofile a BBB complaint against this place.  The owners will know who I am.  In this day and age, I refuse to accept racism as status quo."}
{"text":"The one thing I didn't like is the Mongolian beef dish was loaded with onion \"fillers\""}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here, this is our favorite Chinese food in the valley so far. Went last Friday and tried the steamed Chilean Sea Bass with scallion and ginger based off another Yelper review. We were not disappointed it was so perfectly prepared and delicious! We also had a combination special with shrimp, scallops and beef that was very good as well along with the minced vegetables as a side. All great. We had the potstickers for an appetizer and while the flavor was very good, they ere the kind with very think dough that i do not care for as much as the thinner ones.   Live music and good wine helped round out our dining experience. If you are in the North Valley you can't go wrong with the Jade palace for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is a family favorite. I usually get the vegetable lo mein and my parents enjoy chicken with mixed vegetables. The food is always a fresh and delicious. We always order the food as take out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dim sum this Sunday afternoon. Picked up the following dishes:   Chinese Broccoli-- best dish here Shrimp dumplings (not har gow)-- bland, wrapper was not done right   Rice noodles w/ shrimp-- wrapper was too thick, flavorless, sauce was also blah Tofu w/ shrimp-- tofu was good, but shrimp stuffing left alot to be desired  Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves?-- overcooked, only had a big piece of dry pork    All of the dishes lacked flavor. Tried to make it more palatable with hot chili oil, but that was bland too. WTH?!   Left very disappointed. $27 (pre-tip) is way overpriced for dim sum.. especially if it's low quality.   Service was pretty good, but I would not return even though it's right by my house. Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Service here is like no other restaurant in our area.  It's simply the best.    Food is excellent.  Seems to be authentic Chinese food to me when compared with something like P.F. Changs or other Americanized Chinese restaurants.  We most recently visited on Christmas day for lunch with the family because NOBODY else was open and our major extended family gathering was set to be at supper time.  What were we to do for lunch.  Jade Palace to the rescue.  Though we did not have reservations, we were seated right away.  Orders were taken promptly and we did not wait long for our food to arrive at our table.  It was a happy day.    Prior to our Christmas day visit, my husband and I have been there many times, ordered to go from there many times, and had taken my immediate family there once as well.  We will continue to dine @ Jade Palace regularly.  Thank you for always providing a fantastic dining experience.  No complaints - ever!"}
{"text":"Really good! Went there for the first time today. I got the lunch sweet and sour chicken. The rice was to die for! Awesome!!!! Crab puffs were great too! Nice Servise as well, although I did take my food to go. A little pricey."}
{"text":"So i'm new to Scottsdale, well not new, but i recently got a job here so i'm here on a daily basis now. So instead of your normal franchises, my goal is to try new establishments. I wanted some chicken fried rice and found that Jade Palace had good reviews so i went in.   It's a really nice spot, very modern. Staff was very helpful and i was seated very quickly. I ordered a large spicy fried rice (it was a lot of food, i'm pretty sure i would have been full with the small) and everything was good. Except there was A LOT of oil at the bottom of the plate. That was the only thing i did not like, but if i'm ever craving chines food again, i will definitely go back. They also have good lunch specials."}
{"text":"I've been dining here since prior to their move. They also have another location on Shae Blvd.  Food is very consistent at both locations. This location has live Chinese Guzheng player on weekends. Not sure about weekdays as we always seemed to come here on weekends. We always order our usual dishes that contains chowfun, tofu, green beans and roast duck. The roast duck is really moist and full of flavor perfectly seasoned; the best we had in Arizona. The green beans comes with sour picked vegetables which changes the taste of green beans; definitely an acquired taste. Overall, good meal and good service."}
{"text":"We love Jade Palace on Pima Road so when we were in the area, we knew we wanted to try this location. We tried to order similar food as the other location so we can do a comparison.   The food was very consistent with their other location. The crispy roast duck was cooked to perfection and came with very rich gravy sauce. This sauce was salty at their other location, but here it came out not salty but on the sweeter side. It was really good with the duck, but not by itself with rice. The portion was slightly smaller here as well.   The noodles and green beans were similar to the other location. Hot and sour soup was on the sweeter side. Overall, had a nice meal. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews and wanted to check out this restaurant.  Wasn't that impressed.  The food was good but other issues will prevent me from returning here.    Ordered soup and had to wait about 25 minutes.  It seems there are a lot of regulars that come to this restaurant and they get served first.  The wait staff knows them and spends time chatting with them.  Me and my family were ignored.  So I guess if you frequent them enoguh and become known to them, you will have a great experience.  if you just happen to come in and dine, you will have to wait as i did."}
{"text":"I had ordered my take-out order at the Shea location accidentally only to arrive at the Pinnacle Peak location to find out my error. The staff was very nice about it and got me fixed up right away but the interesting thing was I had been given a price over the phone when I ordered for $51.71 from the Shea location only to find out that the Pinnacle peak location charges more. My bill was $58.83 at the Pinnacle Peak location. I guess I'll attribute it to the high rent district in North Scottsdale. Hopefully it's not because the food is better because it was not great. The sizzling rice soup had 1 shrimp and very little chicken or anything else in it even less sizzling rice than I've gotten from other Chinese take-out. The Yang fried rice was okay didn't really seem like they ever fried the rice and it was mostly rice very little shrimp, chicken or pork. I had the Moo Shu Pork which was good but too salty and the wraps might have been a little stale they had cracks in each one making it impossible to even make a wrap. I ate it with a fork and knife. My daughter had the cashew chicken and although it did have a good amount of cashews she also said it was a little too salty for her liking. So far I can't seem to find any really good Chinese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Not great Chinese food. We saw that the New York egg roll was beloved on Yelp and it was good, but, you know, deep fried anything tastes pretty dang good, especially since I don't usually eat gluten or fried foods. My husband & I got a TON of food to qualify for $10 off of a $45 bill. We tasted beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce, cashew chicken and Szechuan chicken - all were decent but not spectacular. The hot and sour soup gets a lot of play on Yelp, but it was a bowl of gelatin with some tofu and egg - pretty gross, but then again I'm not a big fan of hot and sour soup. Both my husband & I felt sick after eating here so I've downgraded from 3 to 2 stars. We will not go back ever."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese food.  Good for takeout.  Would eat again.  pes¬∑ca¬∑tar¬∑i¬∑an friend liked it as well."}
{"text":"I SOOOOO wanted to like this place, but four (4) attempts, and four failures, I'm DONE!!   No flavor, no visual appeal (looks blobbed together) and nothing appealing."}
{"text":"Disappointed, this used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I don't know if they were having sewer problems but there was a bad smell.  It definitely became stronger when I got closer to walking in to the restroom.  Now.......to the food.  For an extra $2.00 I substituted for the wonton soup.  It was a very small portion, only ONE shrimp and it was OK.  I ordered the Goo Goo Guy Pan (excuse the spelling.).The white rice was soggy and the sauce was too thin.  Before they brought me what I ordered, they brought me the wrong dish.  I asked them where the free hot tea was.  I was told that the machine was broken.  Machine, what machine?  I went there for lunch early and not many people were there.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for not only having boneless spareribs but also for having East Coast Chinese Food. I had the chicken fried rice and the chicken EGG FOO YOUNG which I will search high and low to find and I have had two good ones this week.  I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I have picked up take out from here before but this was the first time dining in.  This is a restaurant that believes in customer service.  Many restaurants could learn from Jade Palace.  They actually greet you with a smile!  There were always two people at the hostess stand so everyone who walked in was greeted. We sat at a table in the bar and had impeccable service from Beth.  We ordered hot and sour soup and lettuce wraps for appetizers.  They assemble the lettuce wraps for you at the table- how nice is that!  I love lettuce wraps but they are usually really high in sodium so I end up drinking a gallon of water after eating them.  These were delicious without killing you with salt.  We ordered the beef and broccoli and the kung pao shrimp.  Both looked and tasted very appetizing and had fresh ingredients.  The broccoli was not soggy or overcooked- it was done perfectly. At the end of the meal they bring a complimentary refreshing sorbet.  The fresh food and the awesome service does come with a price tag as this is pricier than your average Chinese restaurant with many of the dishes at $15 and up, but their service really made an impression. The manager was stopping by tables- ours included- to make sure everyone was happy with their meals. And as other reviewers said the clientele is a little older.  But if you are just picking up food from here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Chinese place ever. It's fancier (and a little pricier) than your average take-out place, but wow. Outstanding food."}
{"text":"Better than most in AZ. It is so hard to find any good Chinese food here. I had a lovely evening At JP. Good food, good service, reasonable prices, great company."}
{"text":"I'll certainly check them out again, as their location off of Shea in Scottsdale has always been good, but I was a bit disappointed by my last meal there.  A small serving for a big price for takeout, and with a bunch of bones to pick out of the fish... not worth the price.  (Other meal of chicken and vegetable fried rice was fine.)  However, like their Shea location, the staff is always very nice, the style and quality of the restaurant very nice, and they normally give generous portions with great plastic take-out boxes that are far better than the paper ones which can get soggy.  I'll be back, and hopefully it will allow me to better my review."}
{"text":"Good food, nice upscale family atmosphere, and great service.  A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for here.  Haven't had a bad meal yet and whether it's dining in or taking out, it has always been satisfactory.  Everyone who I've been there with has liked it as well and keeps going back.  I'll be there again!"}
{"text":"Yum this place is awesome. They bring you a nice pot of Asian tea upon request. The food itself is really tasty. I got the Kung pao three comes with shrimp, scallops, and steal. All of it was great"}
